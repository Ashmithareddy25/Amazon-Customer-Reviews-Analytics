B0001HAISG|5.0|This has got to one of the finest Peter Pan film adaptation ever to grace the Silver Screen.  No matter who you are or how old you are, you can fall in love all over again about the boy who refused to grow up.  The storytelling gets deeper as we learn more about Wendy and that there is so much more to life than being a boy and having fun.  The J.M. Barrie novel of Peter Pan that you that you knew, is not what it appears to be.  It's not just about wanting to grow up, it's about friendship and adventure.  Peter Pan may live in a fantasy world past the stars and straight on till morning, but he is still young and always will reamin young at heart.  The visual effects are astonishing and better than ever can be imagined.  And so is James Newton Howard's score is heart-felt.  It makes you want to believe in Peter Pan.  Of course there's that dreadful Captain Hook (who is also played by Jason Isaacs) is a nightmare to anyone who comes aboard his ship.  Don't get on his 'good' side, that's for sure.  This is the Peter Pan you don't want to miss.

B00007BHOE|5.0|wow is the only way to put how great this dvd really is i think every slipknot fan should go out and buy this!!
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|Dang i just bought the superbit edition...which is 3.5 hours long.. and i thought this version will never be release.<br />oh well, screw it, i might as well buy it again..Das Boot is the BEST WW2 related movie ever. its a Masterpiece.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have heard in a long time.  If you are a Sarah Mclachlan fan, this album will absolutely blow you away.  It was definitely worth the wait.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|I honestly didn't want to see this movie because I wanted Diane Lane to win the Golden Globe (M/C) but I must confess that after seeing it I was surprised (in several ways). First of all, Diane Keaton was great (as much as I hate to say it). She had me laughing and nearly crying; she was totally believable in her character and classically beautiful. This brings me to the down side, however. Jack is usually one of my favorite actors - hands down, but here, although he does a good acting job, he is way out of character. He is just not believable as the \\"playboy\\" type, and he is starting to look his age. BUT this does little to hurt this charming film, and the great supporting cast Amanda and Reeves (who usually sucks) just make this a must see (if only to see how great Diane looks for her age!)
0385336810|5.0|This book was excellant.  I could not put it down. I recommend that every woman order this book today.  It was great!  I loved Jack!!!
B0000JCFPE|5.0|I can't believe I waited so long to see this movie! It left me nearly speechless.  The sex! The plot twists! The madness! How can it all be processed into words. First, the love scenes (if I can even call them that) would make Billy Bob and Hallie blush any day of the week and the famous \\"interrogation\\" was all that it was cracked up to be. By the end of the film I didn't know whether to be aroused or in complete shock. I thought I had it all figured out, but I was thrown for a loop (probably because of Stone's privates and Douglas's bottom all in my face). The last word: a must see, but not with your mother.
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|It's not so ironic as it may seem that the intelligent, flabbergasting music of Jethro Tull became the center of one of the 70s' leading arena attractions. A Jethro Tull concert could be seen as a sanctuary for hard rock fans, especially in that decade, a time when prog-rock (and most of rock/metal labels) was widely dismissed as overblown, empty showiness. This was the band that proved a concert hall full of cheering teenagers were also capable of handling the mind-challenging music and lyrics of Ian Anderson with open-mindedness and maturity. That's why this definitive remaster of &quot;Bursting Out&quot; is such an important piece of rock history.<br />Culled from a captivating European tour, this double disc set defined both this era of rock in general, and this era of Jethro Tull specifically. There are some interesting improvisational moments, such as Anderson's antics on a flute improv including 'God Rest Ye Merry Men' and 'Bouree' (the image of a manic flute player at a rock concert is deliciously intriguing). But while many other places don't sound radically different from their studio versions (music-wise, not time-wise), it's the power and passion of the performance that counts. If you don't plan on buying the entire &quot;Thick As a Brick&quot; album, this is an ideal buy, as it features a 12-minute performance of that record's title song, but you'll also be getting several other Tull classics ('Aqualung,' 'Cross-Eyed Mary,' 'Locomotive Breath,' 'Too Old To Rock and Roll...'), as well as some pieces demonstrating the band's folk influences, ('Songs From the Wood,' 'Jack in the Green').<br />Hopefully with this great remaster, &quot;Bursting Out&quot; will get some more of the attention that it deserves. It is the remnant of a time when rock was striving to gain its respect, but the end of this era for Tull, as several members would soon depart, leaving Ian Anderson to re-craft the band's music.
B00005B36H|5.0|It is hard for me to decide sometimes if I like this or Aenima better. However, I think I have to go with Lateralus. It's more of a concept type album that flows so well it is hard to not listen to the entire album all the way through every time. I rate the tracks like this: <br />The Grudge: 8/10, great first track. catch Maynard's scream near the end. It&quot;s awesome<br />Eon Blue Apocalypse: kind of a filler track but is a great introduction to The Patient<br />The Patient: 10/10, dream-like intro, wonderful singing from Maynard, very powerful musically<br />Mantra: another filler, I heard that it was the sound of a cat being squeezed but slown down. <br />Schism: 9/10, awesome some even though the radio play kind of hurt it for me. One of their best musically in my opinion. <br />Parabol and Parabola: 10/10, even though they are track 6 and track 7 respectively, you cant have one without the other. The first part serves as sort of the calm sedated side and the latter serves as the outburst of emotion. <br />Ticks and Leeches: 9/10, I don't know why everyone says that this song doesn't belong on the album. I think it does. It is also one of their best songs musically in my opinion. Danny's drums are unbelievable. <br />Lateralus: 10/10, I love this song, don't really know how to describe it. The last part from &quot;With my feet upon the ground&quot; to the end is the best I think. <br />Disposition: 8/10, I love the music to this (which is the first phase of the trilogy of Disposition/Reflection/Triad). For some reason I always got the visual of someone walking through a heavy rain when hearing this song. <br />Reflection: 10/10, If I could give this song an 11 I would. My second favorite Tool song ever(behind Third Eye) It makes me want to cry when I hear it. It is a long song but it wouldn't be as good if it were shorter. <br />Traid: 9/10, Better if you see it live. An interesting instrumental. <br />Faaip De Oaid: This is from a radio station. Kind of creepy but interesting to listen to.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big fish. adapted from the novel by daniel wallace is a film that captures the imagination and the emotions. directed by Tim Burton, and a music score by danny Elfman combines to make a wonderful feelgood family movie.
B0000071ZV|3.0|I am a die hard Basia fan!  When I found out that Half A Minute, performed live on the Basia On Broadway CD, was really Matt Bianco's, from years back, I decided to buy this CD and check it out.  Well...it's not Basia.<br />The cornerstones of this CD are Jamaican/Jazz influences.  You'll hear strange little noises and chanting throughout this CD, which really didn't disturb too much.  Some of the songs have good rhythms and decent song structure, but nothing close to Basia's quality.  My favorie song on the disc was, as if you couldn't guess, Half A Minute.  With that said, the rest of the material was just fair.  A couple songs were annoying and I simply hated a couple too.  Plus, Matt doesn't have the vocal chops to get it done.  He's a master on the keyboards and needs to stay there.<br />Bottom line: If you love Basia, you will probably not love this CD.  If like unique music with a Jamaican/Jazz flair, this could be for you.
B000051Y0G|5.0|&quot;She's So Unusual&quot; is clearly one of the defining albums of the 1980's.  Cyndi Lauper's style on this album was incredibly fun, upbeat, and just plain unique.  I can't imagine why anybody who grew up back then would not want this album in their collection.  And, unlike many albums released back then, this effort has aged really well.  It's every bit as fresh and fun today as it was in 1984.
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|After purchasing 100's of alternative and death metal cd's from many different bands, it was this disk by Orphaned Land that prompted me to write a review. Every track is simply flawless. The music more closely resembles a middle-eastern biblicaly inspired Iced Earth meets Opeth then anything else. &quot;Mabool&quot; takes the listener on an unpresedented voyage through the notoriously religious and mysterious land of Israel by combining elements of ancient judaic scripture with catchy death metal guitars. Kobi Farhi provides the majority of the vocals in a style similar to Opeth's Akerfeldt, switching between the standard death metal growl and high-quality singing. The backup female vocals provided by Shlomit Levi are incredible as is the performance by the Moran Ensemble. The catchy guitars played by Matti Svatizki, Yossi Saharonare, and Uri Zelecha on bass are  awesome as is the backing piano played by Eden Rabin. Mabool is a must have cd especially for fans of melodious death metal, Opeth or Iced Earth, worth every penny and much more.<BR>    <BR>    1. Birth of the Three: Track one opens up strong with middle-eastern chanting fading into incredibly catchy guitars and death metal vocals desribing the three sons of seven on which the cd is based. death vocals are perfectly complemented by beautifuly clear, harmonious singing. Guitars are amazingly catchy and the piano backing them makes this song an absolute must hear!<BR>    <BR>    2. Ocean Land: Middle-eastern style guitars place the listener in an ancient desert land to open the track, powerful melodic death metal soon takes over. While the guitars are great, the astoundingly soaring and catchy vocals are key to this songs success.<BR>    <BR>    3. The Kiss of Babylon: My favorite song on the cd. The guitars in this song are incredibly catchy and powerful. The array of vocals ranging from angry death growl to beautiful singing make this song perfect. The song fades into beautiful female hebrew chanting/singing.<BR>    <BR>    4. a'salk: an interesting continuation of the last song. beautiful female vocals along side middle-eastern style guitars mark this song as slow but very melodic.  <BR>    <BR>    5. Halo Dies: Well played metal guitars are combined with biblical singing for the first part of the song, then death vocals take over backed by extremely catchy guitars characteristic of bands like Iced Earth.<BR>    <BR>    6. a call to awake: Great Iced Earth style catchy guitars, very powerful, narrative vocals.<BR>   <BR>    7. Building the ark: Incredible song! The melodic middle-eastern instrumentals are amazing as is the singing. <BR>    <BR>    8. Norra El Norra: Judaic singing backed by powerful guitars. Amazingly Beautiful contrast. Fades into wonderful accoustic and piano. Another of my favorites! <BR>    <BR>    9. The Calm before the Flood: Soaring instrumental, well placed in the cd.<BR>    <BR>    10. Mabool: Another Favorite. Wonderful use of orchestra, powerful guitars and vocals. fastest, loudest song on the cd. A truly epic title-track describing the great flood. <BR>    <BR>    11. The storm still rages inside: Continuation of the last track. Loud, fast and melodic. great narrative vocals, soaring guitars.  <BR>    <BR>    12. Rainbow The Ressurection: Amazing instrumental. Perfect way to end the cd.
B000002UJQ|2.0|That last review is a perfect example of what stuff like this will do to you. People who praise the hell outta this and tell people they're crazy for not liking it, are just as bad as the corporate pop fans they condemn. This band is by no means bad or untalented, I just really dislike them. But you certainly won't catch me listening to Top 40 pop anytime soon. For me, this album is not as good as people say it is. Neither is Dark Side of the Moon. Get Piper at the Gates of Dawn for a true Pink Floyd classic. And as for Radiohead, well I can make no reccomendations.
B000063DFW|5.0|LINKIN PARK ROCKS! and I'm not just saying that. unlike most cds which have only one or two good songs, Linkin Park's hybird theory crashes taht. every song on their cd is virtually amazing. !!!
B000002UA0|5.0|Almost any random five seconds of this album is better than the life work of most musicians, and contains more musical ideas. This be a thickly packed album, mates.  Turning the volume as high as it will allow itself to go, I notice beautiful dense intersections of organ, bass, voice, guitar, drum, and sound effect filling every fraction of a second like the tangles of a fractal.  I can listen to Piper at any scale I want to--grooving to the general sound of a song brings out one thing, but paying attention to the details brings out seventeen different new songs.  There are as many songs in this album as you have time to notice, because the album is a well connected play of genius like almost nothing I've ever heard.  <br />Syd Barrett sounds like he's molesting his guitar, and his style is like something developed in seclusion from all previous currents of music.  I guess I could call it proto-space-funk-on-speed, and I like it more than Hendrix.  But the two famous guitarists are different.  Hendrix, to me, is best for those strange little passages that come out of nowhere, sometimes, in his solos, creating a brief musical world of strangely organic, &quot;dripping&quot; melody and rhythm that never was before and never will be again.  Barrett is a wizard who uses his guitar to create endlessly inventive un-musical sounds, but layers these sounds together in a frenzied and pounding way that somehow wonderfully makes them into music.  Well--I guess they're not that much different.  Barrett's weird, like listening to a flamenco player with a third hand in the middle of an electrified mental breakdown.  But enough of that.  He's gorgeous.  <br />Meanwhile Wright, the organ player, puts down the moods necessary and achieves some astonishing beauties that last just long enough to make me care and just briefly enough to make me miss them after they pass, especially on Matilda Mother and Pow R Toc H.  The drums whack and boom as if they were inside your skull.  The bassscares.  And the lyrics are about flowers, stories, trips, clouds, hide and seek, madness, paranoia, space, and everything cool.  Astronomy Domine balances space gitarr w/ powerfully smooth celestial organ flows.  Interstellar Overdrive should be played in the cockpit of the space shuttle as it takes off.  And there's a song about a cat which is wicked.  <br />Hope I've turned more people on to the Piper.  <br />Please send bread.  I'm hungry.
B0001ENYKS|4.0|I work in a bike shop on the weekends...near the college campus...Franz Ferdinand is not something I am normally exposed to, but since someone always has their iPod plugged into the stereo in the back room, I'm getting exposed to a lot of new stuff.  Among the new stuff is, of course, this album, which has grown on me very quickly.  At first listen, it reminds me a lot of 80's pop, and sometimes it sounds horribly horribly derivative, but when you pause and actually listen to what's playing, you'll find a suprisingly original and good album.  (I'll be buying my copy on the iTunes Music Store, though, thanks.)
B0001Z52RU|5.0|When I saw the preview for this movie, I knew I wanted to see it. I was not disappointed.

B000006U44|5.0|Hard to believe this gem is 27 years old.  For you Kate collectors, the cover art of this CD (not illustrated by Amazon) is the &quot;Red Socks&quot; or &quot;Kate in a crate&quot; cover that was used on the first EMI-U.S. release (not the Harvest &quot;Vogue&quot; cover). Buy this CD! Kate is a creative genius. [This review is only for the Amazon listing; if it is bounced to other sites the cover art comment may not apply.]
B00008K78M|5.0|Man, cuando yo vi por primera vez la tapa de este DVD en Amazon pensaba que iba a ser una de esas producciones de nivel tecnico bajo como las que abundan de cantantes que les toman cuando salen por televisin. Con mucha reticencia me dije juego todo o nada. Y no me equivoque.<BR>Esta es una produccin completamente planificada y tiene una increible calidad de imagen y buenos planos; si a esto le agregas tu un buen sistema de parlantes con woofer la experiencia es total, te hace sentir que estas al borde del escenario chequeando a la Diva.<BR>Las canciones estan en italiano pero francamente no viene al caso porque son facilmente entendibles si ya has escuchado las canciones en espaol. Y justamente pensado en esto Laura nos ha incluido 4 hermosas canciones en espaol:  volvere junto a ti, entre tu y mil mares, inolvidable y amores extraos. Ademas hay 4 video clips que lo pasan por tv de los cuales volvere junto a ti y Dos historias iguales estan en espaol. Hay mas material en video de los preparativos de su concierto para que puedas disfrutar.<BR>Que mas se puede decir? nada mas que preparar el popcorn , sentarse y subir el volumen para disfrutar.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|The movie shows a collection of stories that at first seem independent of each other, but we start seeing interrelationships as the action advances. The narrator is trying to demonstrate that love is everywhere and that is why he is \\"telling\\" us all these different anecdotes.<br />I have always favored British humor, and in this case I was not let down, since some of the situations are absolutely hilarious. There are almost no words to describe the unbelievable cast, which includes actors like Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson and Colin Firth, among many others.<br /><br />David (Hugh Grant) is the new British Prime Minister and upon his arrival at his new \\"home\\" is captivated by Natalie, his new personal assistant. Bill is a singer at the end of his career trying to make a come back with a Christmas hit by adapting the lyrics of an old hit to make it a Christmas song. Peter and Juliet got married recently, and Peter's best friend, Mark, is having trouble dealing with this new event because he holds a secret that can destroy everything. Colin, a young impetuous guy, is looking for love and decides that his best option is to go to America, where the girls are \\"easier\\".<br /><br />Daniel (Neeson) has recently lost his wife and is trying to surge into clarity again while taking care of Samuel, his beloved stepson. At the same time, Samuel has a crush on a girl at school and is very serious about it, seeking Daniel's help for his quest. Sarah is in love with one of her co-workers, but has a burden that makes her life very complicated. Finally, Jamie is an author, who found his wife cheating on him with his brother, and looked for refuge in France. Here he meets Aurelia, a Portuguese girl that works as his maid.<br /><br />This is the best romantic comedy I have seen in the last few years. The dialogues are funny and witty, the cast is first class and there is not one dull moment in the whole film. As a final note, just watching the scene in which Hugh Grant dances, makes this movie worth seeing!makes this movie worth seeing!
B00005N5S5|5.0|This story of pre-apocalyptic murder and mayhem is still the thrill-ride it was when I first saw it in the theater in the mid-80's. While some of the effects look dated (not to mention the night-club fashions), this still holds up as a piece of low-budget/guerrilla film-making that transcends the genre. <br />More than just a monster-of-the-week gorefest, The Terminator manages to create characters you care about, characters - Sarah Connor in particular - who actually, and believably, mature over the course of the movie. Although it falls into the &quot;gorefest&quot; category, Stan Winston &amp; crew manage to put together some gut-wrenchingly realistic moments during the Terminator's self-surgery scenes.<br />In addition to the movie in full- and wide-screen formats, the DVD also includes the original mono soundtrack and a new 5.1 stereo version. While the sound effects are better in the stereo version, the dialogue frequently sounds washed out under headphones - an actual surround-sound system may perform better, I don't know. There are a couple nice documentaries, and the production artwork is actually worth checking out (James Cameron's days in Roger Corman's art department really show here). About all that's missing are cast and crew commentaries, but a lot of that kind of content is included in the documentaries.<br />If you've never seen The Terminator, you're missing one of greatest sci-fi/horror films of all times. This movie, Alien(s), and Blade Runner exemplify the Tech-Noir movement of the Eighties. That nothing has come close to rivaling them in the past decade and a half demonstrates how good these movies are. Check 'em out.
B0001HAISG|5.0|the trailer music i heard was coldplay i think the song is clocks but it is definitely coldplay
B0001WTUH6|5.0|I am a huge fan of monster movies, in particular the vampire and werewolf variety.  Unfortunately, most of these movies turn out to be, shall we say, not so good.  However, I am always hopeful that something great is just around the bend...<BR>My hopes were not in vain on this one.  Underworld is easily one of my favorites of all time.  Despite a limited budget ($30 mil) and the daunting task of cramming a thousand years of vampire/werewolf history into two hours, Wiseman and company still managed to make it believable and interesting.  Underworld could follow in the footsteps of other small budget fantasy/sci-fi flicks that went on to become great franchises, so to speak, such as The Matrix ($63 mil), Highlander, and the grandaddy of them all Star Wars ($11 mil).  Anyway, if you're a fan of vampires, werewolves, monsters, or Kate Beckinsale, I highly recommend this movie to you.  And if you're not a fan of Kate Beckinsale, you should be.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|JUST HERE TO SAY THAT TRACK NUKBER 6 (ODE TO ORSEN ISHII - BY RZA) IS A RIP OFF SONG AND IS ALMOST THE EXACT BEAT AS TEN TOES TALL - BY LIL WYTE ON HIS ALBUM &quot;DOUBT ME NOW&quot; - THE SONG BY LIL WYTE IS BETTER TOO THAN RZA'S VERSION
B000002V0Q|5.0|this is one of the best megadeth cds ever! It was my second megadeth cd after &quot;hidden treasures&quot; also an excellent cd, my favorite song on this cd is &quot;sweating bullits&quot;. It's all good on this cd! check it out, you wont regret it!!!!!!
B0001GL3K4|3.0|Excellent talent holds you to the end of this story, which would have looked ok on a stage, but the contrived feel ultimately disappoints.
B000068OSK|5.0|Wow, what a great album. This is one of the times when you are unsure at first but every listen gets better and better. I might even go as far as to say it is my favorite now. It is so simple, so passionate, so very good.<br />Often I judge an album on its first five tracks. If an album can pack a punch in its first 5 songs, it is likely great throughout. That is certainly the case here (an interesting debate would be whether the first 5 songs are better on this album or on De Stijl but thats a different issue). Jimmy the Exploder, Stop Breaking Down and Big Three are the first 3 tracks. They are all hard rock and awesome, Stop Breaking Down being my favorite. Then just as rocking as it was going it instantly slows down. Suzy Lee is the next song. It is slow but it may be the best song on the album. Followed up by Suger Never Tasted So Good- a melodic song with great lyrics and an even better feel. All in all, the first 5 tracks are enough to win you over. Maybe not the first listen maybe not the second, but eventually.<br />The middle of the album drops off slightly in quality but it is still good. And you will probably still be reeling from the first 5 anyway. Other things to note are the AWESOME guitar riff on Screwdriver, the eccentricity of One More Cup of Coffee, and the trancelike music of I Fought Piranhas. An interesting thing to note is the longest song is just a hair over three minutes. It really is a shame because on many of the tracks, it will leave you wanting much much more.
B00004Y6RO|4.0|Slipknot at their best this album rocks on all levels great effects loud a$$ gutiars and fast drum beats. If you dont own this album or Slipknots Iowa or Vol 3 Subliminal Verses then get them I have heard Vol 3 and its not even out yet. Vol 3 is a more mature CD there are a few songs that are soft but all the other songs are heavy and full of great screaming. If you do pick up Slipknots first album pick it up in this format (Digipak) it has demos a live song and a hidden track at the end of the disc great album to own. If you haven't seen them live you are missing out big time they are way better live than in the studio.

B000059XYK|4.0|&quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; exists for one purpose: to show off some of the hottest cars in existence. The storyline is kind of hokey, but the cars more than make up for it, especially the GT 500. The car chase at the end is one of the best ever filmed! All the actors (Especially Robert Duvall, who can never give a bad performance) do fine in their roles. All in all, &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; is a one @#*&amp; of a ride!<br />Also, don't miss Christopher Eccleston (plays the villain, Raymond Vincent Calitri, in this film) this January, when he resurrects one of the greatest characters of all time, the Doctor, in BBC's new &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series. BBC plans to send it to American TV stations as well.<br />Movie Grade: B+

B0000C9ZSV|3.0|When Jimi Hendrix played Berkleley he was exhausted from his 1970 American Tour. He played many festivals that year either getting delayed or cancalled. It was the worst year for Jimi Hendrix. The whole Berkeley project was recorded and filmed. The Berkeley Concerts are scattered on dozens of CD'S including Voodoo Chile The Hendrix Collection, Jimi Hendrix Blues, etc. I was excited when this came out thinking it was full-length. Latter on I discovered the CD I had just bought was only the second set. I thought from all the scattered songs from Berkley their would be a double CD including the whole concert. But still only a scattered recording from the second set. <br />The second set was good hendrix's Machine Gun ran on too long without any meaning as he had had with the Fillmore East. Alot of the songs seemed crappy like Hey Joe when Hendrix's has difficulties with the amps. Its a shame any company can release Berkeley in this format but in all its an average recording that was left behind. Its not one of his best performences. But if you love Hendrix like I do buy it and discover the music. Enjoy
B00003CXA2|5.0|Tom Hanks is a great actor!<br />At this point in the review process it would be pointless to tell you about this movie. So many other reviewers have already done it pretty darn good.<br />However, I can tell you that I wholeheartedly enjoyed this motion picture. An absolutely great picture that is a must see.<br />If you haven't seen this picture, then you should. This is a movie to own!
B00008WG3U|5.0|Thats what NOFX believes in this great album.  Most of the songs in it are about how much they hate the govt. and expecially George Bush.  Infact if you pop this cd into your computer it will play a segment on the election of George Bush and stuff on how he cheated.  I myself agree with NOFX in everything they say about Bush.  But as for the songs, they are very good.  <br />1-&quot;Seperation of Church and Skate&quot; is a very good song about how Punk is turning into (clean, pop-sounding) rock.  There job is to keep punk rock alive.<br />2-&quot;The irrationality of Rationality&quot; is an Okay song about how some people may be lucky with a good job and rich, but then you gota look at the single people with three little kids and a low pay work, and how much their lives suck but through all that they still make it.  Not how fare is it that rick a$$holes get to slide through the hardships of life.  Well thats my view on it anyways.  Even though i like the lyrics, i dont like the music as much.  Its an Okay song non-the less.<br />3-&quot;Franco-Unamerican&quot; is about George Bush and how what he does is &quot;Unamerican&quot; according to his own laws.  Its a realy good song that incorperates Ska (similar sounding to &quot;Rancid&quot; a good band).  This song is also one of my favorite of the Cd just because I compleatly understand every little bit of lyrics.  :D<br />4-&quot;Idiots are Taking Over&quot; is another good song on NOFX's view on the Govt leaders.  It has a good rythem but sounds a little different (as far as guitar) than most other NOFX songs.<br />5-&quot;She Nubs&quot; is a funny ska rock sound about some crazy chick.  Its not political like the other songs but its realy funny if you just listen to the lyrics.  Different sound, but one of my favorites.  <br />6-&quot;Mattersvill&quot; is my favorite song on this cd.  Its about an imaginary village that Punks can live in with their own laws and rules and lifestyles.  The sound of this song is realygood.  It sounds a little different from the other songs, but its awsome.<br />The rest of the songs are good, but all the best songs are the first six i just told you about, so if you like rock, or if your a punk of some kind, check out this cd.  Its awsome.

B000002NFM|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time and one of the best albums of the 1990's. The dark techno vibe carries you from the very first track and takes you on a journey while assaulting your senses from all sides through to the final one. If you're under 30 and haven't got this in your collection then you must be either dead or dull.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album is one of my favorites, it's a great blast, ecspecially if you want to blow off some steam!
B00005JKN9|2.0|The question came to me over and over again as I sat watching this movie: How in the world did this movie receive 10 Oscar Nominations?<br /> It's a good thing it didn't actually win any. <br />Gangs of New York depicts the violence that erupts in New York between the Irish Americans and the \\"Nativist\\" Americans in the mid 19th century. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon, who witnesses his father die at the hands of the leader of the \\"Natives\\", Bill Cutting (aka The Butcher, played by Daniel Day-Lewis). The prologue shows this bloody scene between the two rival groups, and, afterwards, we cut to 15 years later with Amerterdam returning to New York amid the chaotic scene of gang violence. He eventually comes into contact with Cutting again, who is one of the leaders of the New York scene. <br />The film lacked any deep conviction by its leading stars. For one, we don't really sympathize with DeCaprio's character because he seems to lack the substance to take action at any of the right points. Cutting comes across as a true villain, but there is something irking about the way Day-Lewis plays him. Maybe it's the Al Capone (a la Robert DiNero) style of tough boss that he tries to exert in a movie set in a different time period. Cameron Diaz' character really didn't even need to be inserted in the script, as she had no bearing on the real story taking place. <br />Not only were the characters flat, but the movie lacked any real substance. For a three hour movie, there really wasn't much of a point other than revenge. The \\"epic feeling\\" didn't ring forth; it seemed like an overdramatization of violence to me. Some of the scenes are so long and drawn out that it kills any power they might have had. <br />Recommended instead of this: Casino
0553213105|5.0|I think Jane Austen wrote a very good novel. I liked the characters in the novel and the plot. My favorite character in the novel was Elizabeth Bennet. I liked how she acted towards all the other characters with her quick wittedness and her cleverness.  She was a very honest person who rose above her class bound society. She holds to what she thinks and believes in. For example in Chapter 3 she has a disliking toward the Bingley sister's, while Jane finds them &quot;charming&quot; Elizabeth still holds her feelings of dislike towards them.<br />  Another character I enjoys throughout the book was Mr. Bennet. Mr. Bennet was the only man in a house of six women. The women wore him out and all of them were very difficult to deal with. He would always give me a good laugh throughout the whole book by his sarcastic humor. I like him also because he reminded me of Elizabeth because of their quick-wittedness and also they were the two closest in the family since they were the two smartest. I thought the two of them were most close in Chapter 13.<br />  I enjoyed the novel's plot because of the girls and how they turned men down of proposals and the different down falls and happiness of all the girls' love lives.  All the girls have disappointments and confusion with the men and people they love; yet not all of their situations work out the way some of the girls had hoped. Elizabeth holds strong and but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. Throughout all of the confusion, Jane and Elizabeth are happily married at the end.
0156027321|1.0|It is disappointing how this book has become the darling of the<BR>book clubs.  Unbelievable, poorly researched (if you care about<BR>reality), ridiculous even, it certainly isn't a realistic <BR>novel.  If it is an allegory, try reading Bunyan's Pilgrim's <BR>Progress instead.

B0001HLVS2|5.0|-             <BR>The film, Master and Commander, based on the novels of Patrick O'Brian, speaks to the pinnacle achievements of European culture. What a great pity that the world is now suffocated by a poisoned atmosphere of jealousy and hate directed against Caucasian Europeans, such that many proud inheritors of their singular Western Culture are afraid to speak its name, or to herald its praises directly and without apology or explanation. The creators of this film have pushed at the envelope of containment that surrounds every possible celebratory depiction applauding Europeans, or the achievements of Western Culture and Christian-based societies. However, despite the courage of the director, co-screen writer, and co-producer: Peter Weir, and despite the fact that this work is bolder and more honest than other products coming from the entertainment industry, not everything here is boldly spoken. There is a great deal to be absorbed by analyzing the symbolism and the metaphoric content of this film-a great deal of the message is delivered in metaphor, and with the music. <br />The overall musical presentations of this film are very impressive, and the CD of the musical score is far from a disappointment. The skillfully repetitious use of percussion instruments throughout the film successfully recreates the sound of a thumping on the ship's hull: a sound that chills the heart of every sailor and alerts him to danger. The blood, the bravery, the glories of battle, as well as the continued yearning to acquire knowledge and  explore the unknown, are punctuated by the music of Mozart, Corelli, Bach, and Boccherini, each of whom is the product of a refined, highly developed  European culture, represented here by one French and one British warship on the untamed, empty sea. <br />Russell Crowe, as Captain \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey of H.M.S. Surprise, and Paul Bettany, as the ship's surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin-reunited after their fine performances in A Beautiful Mind-symbolize the intricate structure, the delicate balance, the intellectual and artistic achievements, and even the fragility of European civilization, as their characters perform in the great-cabin of a 19th Century warship, some of the most beautiful and sophisticated classical music ever written. Also a product of European culture is the clever, unseen captain of the French frigate Acheron, who hounds and bedevils Aubrey-on the far side of the world- as this remarkable film reveals the story of a conflict between two European empires played out on the bloody decks of two warships, in the era of Napoleon I. <br />The action, for the most part, takes place aboard H.M.S. Surprise, amid a plethora of subtle contrasts skillfully woven into the structure of the story.  These contrasts define the men, their race, and their culture: science vs. superstition, boldness vs. complacency order vs. disruption, leadership vs. permissiveness, intelligent adaptation vs. extinction. <BR>The choices made by the ships company and how they act and react, in the face of these contrasts, makes a statement about who they are and what they represent.<BR>Captain Aubrey reminds his crew to always stand tall and uphold their beliefs and their people, for wherever their small ship sails it represents England. Again and again, the cameras show a small ship in a vast expanse of ocean, floating into an uncertain future under a darkening sky. An excellent metaphor pointing to the uncertain future of White Europeans and Western Culture, which are already under relentless attack from the socialist remnants of collapsed Communism, and from \\"politically correct\\" historical revisionism striving to diminish or remove any reference to heroic Caucasian males, like Captain Jack Aubrey. <br />The original score's musical reverberations suggest a beating against the hull, rather than the sound of cannons shooting-there is no sharp \\"crack\\" as might be expected with the sound of gunfire. This simplicity of deep aboriginal-like drumming is a counterpoint to the sweet complexity of the classical compositions punctuating the story, which at first appears to address only the interactions of two ships. It is only upon closer analysis that the racial and cultural aspects become apparent. The real threat to England and H.M.S. Surprise is not from France, a fellow European nation, or from France's warship Acheron; the threat is from that percussive thumping on the hulls of both ships, as if something on the outside wanted to get inside-inside the warships and inside the ships-of-state represented by Surprise and Acheron. <br />The several all too brief glimpses into the great-cabin of Surprise, where Captain Aubrey and Dr. Maturin play on violin and cello respectively-while outside the endless, untamed sea stretches to infinity-are among the most moving I have seen. The most compelling is when Surprise is sailing slowly ahead, and the camera angle is from outside the great-cabin looking in through the wide-open stern windows, as though the viewer were seeing through the eyes of a skulking enemy, or the sea itself. The ship, and the heroes, and the music are warm and candle-lit inside, but the wild sea, the unknown future, and unknown dangers are watching from close behind-a powerful suggestion of man's Darwinian struggle for survival, for procreation, for adventure, and sometimes for fun.  <BR>The classical music is used as a skillful surgeon uses a scalpel, to separate the light from the dark, to define the good and the glory, to contrast hope from hopelessness, and to inspire today's sons and daughters of men like \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey and his disciplined, faithful crew to look around them and prepare to fight off, yet again, threats to their future, their culture and their people. As the sweet music fills the cabin and drifts away, the small ship sails alone on an endless sea-above all, there is the music.<br />If, indeed, all art aspires to the condition of music, then the miraculousmelodies in this film represents the culmination of two thousand, and more, years of unequaled European cultural achievements. Listen to it! Experience it!
B00006M183|4.0|Once Pearl Jam releases one or two more albums (and you know they will) people will look back on this one and group it together with No Code and Vitalogy as one of the definite standouts of the Pearl Jam library.  &quot;1/2 Full&quot; sounds like a throwback to Eddie's days in Temple of the Dog, and &quot;All or None&quot; would feel right at home on No Code (greatest album ever).  Then you've got songs like &quot;You Are&quot;, &quot;Can't Keep&quot;, and &quot;Bushleaguer&quot; which highlight the bands ability to create all of these fantastic albums without one of them sounding wholly like its predesessors (save for a couple tracks of course).  <br />   Buy this album now, before it becomes a classic, so you can tell everyone that you loved it before it was popular.
B000002C1W|5.0|The album indeed has an an 80's sound, but this is certainly not the 80's of &quot;Safety Dance&quot;. A Momentary Lapse of Reason represents the best of that decade's possibilities--yes, the sound is &quot;harder&quot; than you might find before or after, but I greatly prefer this slightly edgier sound to the feel of current pop music. Although thematically not as unified as its predecessors, there is a definite flow in the mood of the album, from a guardedly optimistic beginning to a hopeless, bitter end. The sound clips are well placed to augment the running themes. Probably the best example of that is in &quot;Yet Another Movie&quot;, one of the album's greatest stars, where clips from Casablanca set the scene for a world that seems to be entering into a second Holocaust--this time a nuclear one.<br />Despite what some say, I have a personal theory that there is in fact a loose theme on A Momentary Lapse of Reason. Judging from some of his output on his solo album About Face, Mr. Gilmour (the main lyricist) seems to have been quite concerned with the situation of the Cold War. It seems to me that the album, when you put it all together, has possibly got a nuclear-destruction scenario. Even the title A Momentary Lapse of Reason reminds me of the old description of what would happen if someone did push the nuclear button: MAD--Mutual Assured Destruction. Another clue may be in the instrumental &quot;Terminal Frost&quot;: its title suggests nuclear winter, and the sound clip in it: &quot;Never, ever again...&quot; evokes for me the fear of a second Holocaust--for which a worldwide nuclear cataclysm would certainly qualify.<br />To me, all of the songs on this album have a place--even the much maligned &quot;A New Machine&quot; songs. Really, they were never meant to serve as full songs, but as interstitial pieces, they do fine at highlighting the atmosphere of desolation that sets in at the end of the album. The second half of the album, by the way (from &quot;YetAnother Movie&quot; forward) is where the strongest songs are, contrary to what some reviewers have said. Not only are the songs here the best (think of the fantastic &quot;Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Yet Another Movie&quot;, and &quot;Terminal Frost&quot;), but the flow of the mood is most coherent here.<br />Not only is &quot;Yet Another Movie&quot; an excellent song, but from a synthesizer standpoint, it takes advantage of the best the 80s had to offer. In my opinion, the synths of the 80s were best in music with a darker, mysterious mood, of which &quot;Yet Another Movie&quot; is a perfect example. The next second-side standout, &quot;Terminal Frost&quot;, is a slow-moving, haunting piece that has some nice piano (by Mr. Wright himself, perhaps?), and also some very pleasant saxophone work as well as the guitar solo. In a way, it's almost like a darker version of the songs on Richard Wright's solo album Wet Dream. &quot;Sorrow&quot;, of course, is quite good here, and of the three versions I'm familiar with, this is my second favorite, below the PULSE video version (which differs from the CD version in that it is utterly mean).<br />The first half has good tracks as well, but is slightly choppier in flow. Frankly, I think it's because &quot;On the Turning Away&quot; breaks up the mood, and would have probably been better off on About Face than this one. It's not a bad song--but it's a bit too cheery for the rest of the album. My particular favorites on the first half are &quot;Signs of Life&quot; and &quot;One Slip&quot; (&quot;Learning to Fly&quot; is good but I prefer it by far on PULSE). In a strange way, &quot;Signs of Life&quot; seems related to the later &quot;Cluster One&quot;--although with the synth and guitar reversed in prominence (the guitar as the more prominent one on &quot;Signs of Life&quot;...which makes me wonder if the reversal on &quot;Cluster One&quot; heralds Mr. Wright's return, musically). Even the songs I did not mention, or discussed in less depth, are still good tracks. Mr. Gilmour's lyric-writing is actually very good even if he doesn't show the conceptual inclinations of Roger Waters, and his guitar playing most certainly hasn't suffered.<br />It may seem surprising for an ardent Richard Wright fan to think so highly of this album, given his limited involvement--but even after all this time, I can't help still having a huge soft spot for A Momentary Lapse of Reason. Besides, Mr. Gilmour isn't half bad as a keyboardist--just as on his first solo album, it's clear he has a rather underrated talent. I'm not sure which parts are his...but nothing sticks out as being out of place, so I'm assuming whatever he did was up to standards. Even now I can't help but be impressed at how well Pink Floyd pulled through its darkest hour. It is a fine predecessor to The Division Bell, which fulfills the promises of potential made here.
B000002BFZ|5.0|A semi-experimental album for the band, in the sense that it's a far cry from predescessors \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs\\", but that's the way it should be.  With a CD library boasting eight studio releases and hundreds of live bootlegs, these guys give you a reason to own every one, because no single album can even be compared to another.  <br />A definite stand-out in the Pearl Jam catalog.  Listeners who enjoyed \\"Vitalogy\\" and \\"Binaural\\" will enjoy this happy medium.  This is an album where the bands' influences weigh heavy on their sound.  To any real Pearl Jam fan, I say pick this one up, but as mentioned above: it sounds nothing like previous (more mainstream) releases, so anyone only familiar with popular radio staples such as \\"Alive\\", \\"Even Flow\\", or \\"Elderly Woman...\\", maybe give it a listen first.  Although it is great music, the mainstream audience won't recognize it as the Pearl Jam that they're familiar with, but to any hardcore fan, this is the one that will sit atop the shrine.
0812550706|5.0|a great read...relentlessly fun and will keep you on the &quot;edge of your book&quot; at all times!  fast paced while retaining realistic characters that you actually care about! great philosphical ideas that will keep you contemplating days after finishing the book!
B00008CLOA|5.0|This, along with Wish You Were Here, are the most &quot;psychedelic&quot; sounding of Pink Floyd's albums. Essential to a classic rock collection. AWESOME!!!
0451452739|2.0|...at times far too poetic for a casual reader like me.  The plot was very hard to grasp, it left me with many unanswered questions...although the writing was magnificent and descriptive, it was slow paced and often &quot;boring.&quot;  There were some very enticing moments but were followed by lagging scenerios .,..
B0001HAISG|5.0|At first when me and my friends planned to watch the movie, i wasn't too keen on it because i thought it would be childish, I was wrong. After watching it, it became one of my favourite movies. Neverland has never looked so real. Jeremy Sumpter was definitely a great choice for peter pan - cute, cheeky, full of mischief. And Jason Issacs played mr darling and hook very well. After buying the DVD and saw some of the cut off scenes, I loved it even more especially the alternate ending, the ending they chose was very bitter-sweet. The extra stuff the DVD has incorporated was really amazing, the tours of neverland, the makings of mermaids was wonderful...and lots more there! Buying it is definitely a good choice for me.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|This movie is my favorite, ever.  I have seen it over 100 times and now with the added scenes I want to watch it again already!<BR>The film has been restored as has the soundtrack. My original GBU DVD suffered some mis calibration, voices were off etc. This seems much better for the most part. The movie was shorn of around 20 minutes for the U.S. release, these scenes hence were never done in English.  Clint and Eli Wallach came back to voice in their lines for said scenes.  Some one was brought in to do Lee Van Cleef as he passed away in the 90's.  Wallach's voice shows it's age but's it's not detracting, Clint sounds great, Van Cleef's impersonator does quite well.  A classic movie that can now be seen in the way Leone intended.   outstanding special features too.  A must for Italian western fans, and great movies in general.
B0001DI0FI|3.0|a boring movie. It is over 2 hours and 15 minutes and the action scenes are bland and confusing. I don't mind a long movie but this movie wasn't very interesting, so I don't like the length. The extras are good.
B00005JLR8|5.0|I have read a couple reviews in which people commented on how unrealistic parts of this movie was: how the junkies in the neighborhood would have been much worse in real life, how the air conditioning scene was unrealistic.  Please.  Anyone who wastes their time analyzing a movie based on its realism, unless it is advertised as &quot;A 100% TRUE DOCUMENTARY&quot;, should be thrown from the Empire State Building.  (As a side note, just last week I walked 4 blocks with an air conditioner in tow and dealt with the 'plug' issue...after which I had to take about 10 showers to cool down.)  The acting of the children, as mentioned, was wonderful and believable.  The adults paled in comparison, but any quirks can be overlooked.  If you don't like this movie, as several people have mentioned, then you truly are cold blooded and heartless.  I think these negative reviewers were angry that the city, while full of promise, did not eventually suck all the life out of the family and leaves it in shambles.  Well, sorry!  NYC, with all its flaws, really does have a big heart for people who are willing to share theirs.  Like any place and any time, sometimes life doesn't work out like a fairy tale.  Well, neither does this story - but it does offer a positive message of hope and family and shows that good things DO happen to good people.  Be warned, I cried through at least 50% of the movie and I'm a big macho dude!  I loved it and will recommend it to everyone I know.
B000092ZYX|4.0|The vocals in this CD are varied emotionally.  At times you are nearly put to sleep and then a frenzied outburst kind of brings you to.  Sometimes the repetitive electronica bores me (THE RAINDROPS...please stop the raindrops).  Other times, the orchestration is so interesting and varied that you can find something unique in each phrase (Go to sleep).  What I like most in this CD IS the variety.  The problem is, you have to actively listen to it to really appreciate it.  It's kind of funny, because I bring this CD to work and play it and watch the puzzled look on people's faces as they pass by.  Radiohead just isn't &quot;Radio&quot; music.  You can't passively listen and still appreciate it.  I like the challenge of listening to this CD, all the musical twists and turns that it takes, and it also has some important points to make too. So, listen! pay attention, and please...don't go to sleep.
B00000F5KH|5.0|I feel it so warm and touched throughout the whole plot.I'd like to emphasize that Central Station is really a simple but DEEP movie!!I seldom watch road movie,and since watching Central Station,I have a completely new insight about it!!<BR>Fate lead Dora (Fernanda Montenegro) &amp; Josue (Vinicius de Oliveira) come together.You will find everything is so natural &amp; Logical. <BR>As for the pictures, I especially love the one when Josue look outside the train to search his home. The scenery is beatiful yet blurred(coz the railway is moving)! I guess it implys that he's searching for his blurred identity.<BR>Moreover,I do think that Montenegro is the highlight of the movie. Her role is sometimes cynical but interesting, &amp; sometimes touching &amp; lovely too!<BR>I highly recommend this movie!!!It reminds me &quot;Love Actually is everywhere&quot;!!~~*
B00005V0X5|3.0|I have the old version of the cd but I have listened to the remastered version and there's not much difference, the original didn't have bad production anyway. As for the bonus tracks, the cover of These Boots just sucks because of the annoying beep, the demos aren't bad but aren't something you're gonna listen to much.    The band is talented at this early stage. Dave and someone else whom I cannot remember, nor care about their name? Excellent guitar work, but their song writing is still undeveloped and although amazing skill is shown, things can get a tad boring occasionally. Also, they are very fast and the solos are damn excellent! Dave's vocals are pretty annoying, but they get better as time goes by on other albums. Drumming is pretty good. Nothing too special, but not bad by any means. Better than Lars Ulrich! The bass is fantastic but in some songs it's very hard to hear.  Some of the lyrics are stupid, but then again so are some of Metallica's, although their debut was better. Do I have a problem with Dave getting kicked from Metallica? No way! It worked for the better. Now after that happened we ended up with two great thrash bands instead of one!    As for the songs there is some filler(probably not intentional, as I said their song writing skills aren't fantastic yet), and that coupled with Dave's vocals led me to the verdict that this album deserves 3 stars, not a bad cd, but not essential. If you're an old fan, it's up to you whether you buy it or not, new fans, start elsewhere.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Well, I guess I'd better get my TooL comparison over with.<br /><br />Unless you've been living in a bomb shelter for the past decade or so, chances are you HAVE heard the music of TooL.  This band has absolutely transformed metal into a form of art, and has completely changed the face of rock music in general.  Regardless of your feelings about them, you can't deny their talent or influence on modern rock.<br /><br />Perhaps the driving force of TooL is the lead vocalist, who is, of course, Maynard James Keenan.  His talent and style make him, without a doubt, the most original and downright breath-taking vocalist of ALL modern music, and is greatly recognized for his abilities around the world.<br /><br />So when news came of a new band with Keenan's name on the roster, it's safe to say the world went nuts.  Although it was Billy Howerdell who formed the group and wrote the songs, it's pretty obvious that A PERFECT CIRCLE's immediate popularity came from Keenan.<br /><br />Although this band's music is a tad bit calmer then the normal crushing complexity of TooL's roaring instruments, A PERFECT CIRCLE is no less extravagantly beautiful and precise, and Maynard's voice is no less blatantly gorgeous.  And even if Maynard's style is different here than with TooL, it's remains unmistakably Maynard, and that's enough please anyone.<br /><br />What's even better is that Maynard isn't the only thing to like about A PERFECT CIRCLE.  Billy Howerdell REALLY knows his frickin stuff, and his conviction and talent, as well as the rest of the band's contributions, is what makes this album such a gem.  The album opener `the Package' is the absolute perfect song for realization of this fact.  Each instrument is easily defined throughout the 7-minute track, and each artist displays their abilities with dazzling style.  The lead single `Weak and Powerless', even with it's somber and quiet melodies, remains a compelling and ridiculously brilliant song.  The soft acoustic number \\"a Stranger\\" is probably the most beautiful track on the album musically, and it's beauty is realized once again with Maynard's riveting vocals.<br /><br />The only two existing heavy pieces here(`the Outsider' and `Pet') are not to be ignored, as each is sung INCREDIBLY, each played MAGNIFICENTLY, they are easily among the greatest of all the hard rock songs that I have personally heard.  Which, in all sincerity, ain't much.<br /><br />The lyrics on this album are, again, something special.  Maynard, I believe, also took on responsibilities for lyric-writing, and he remains a steadfastly potent and able writer.  The song `Pet' deals with deception and lies from the point of view of the deceiver, bent on leading his prey to destruction with lines like:<br /><br />  \\"put your head down child, I won't let the boogyman come/count bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums/pay no mind to the rabble, pay no mind . . . stay with me/safe from pain, and truth, and choice--and other poison devils, saying `they don`t give a f**k about you', like I do . . .\\"<br /><br /> It's chilling and downright COOL CRAP.  At least to me.<br /><br />\\"Thirteenth Step\\" is an elegant contribution to any record collection, and should certainly please any fan of Maynard's past works.  Though, if you ARE a fan of Maynard's past works, then you probably already have this album, which makes this review absolutely pretentious and useless, so now I feel like a complete retard.  Thanks alot, jerks.utiful track on the album musically, and it's beauty is realized once again with Maynard's riveting vocals.     The only two existing heavy pieces here(`the Outsider' and `Pet') are not to be ignored, as each is sung INCREDIBLY, each played MAGNIFICENTLY, they are easily among the greatest of all the hard rock songs that I have personally heard.  Which, in all sincerity, ain't much.     The lyrics on this album are, again, something special.  Maynard, I believe, also took on responsibilities for lyric-writing, and he remains a steadfastly potent and able writer.  The song `Pet' deals with deception and lies from the point of view of the deceiver, bent on leading his prey to destruction with lines like:          \\"put your head down child, I won't let the boogyman come/count bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums/pay no mind to the rabble, pay no mind . . . stay with me/safe from pain, and truth, and choice--and other poison devils, saying `they don`t give a f**k about you', like I do . . .\\"     It's chilling and downright COOL CRAP.  At least to me.     \\"Thirteenth Step\\" is an elegant contribution to any record collection, and should certainly please any fan of Maynard's past works.  Though, if you ARE a fan of Maynard's past works, then you probably already have this album, which makes this review absolutely pretentious and useless, so now I feel like a complete retard.  Thanks alot, jerks.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I was at first hesitant to buy this album, as you may be, but once I got it, I found that each song was unique and, most suprisingly, I found all but 1 to be great! This CD easily received 5 stars, despite what others say. Being a musical person, I can appreciate this with much respect. As far as I know, Audioslave is made up of Rage Against the Machine, which I never really liked very much, and Soundgarden, who I like a lot. Brad Wilk is the drummer. He plays very simply, but very strong and confidently. He doesn't do much fancy stuff. Of course, Tom Morello is the guitarist, and he's really great. His solos are so rad. The solos are repetitive, but so cool. Tim Commerford does a great job on bass. Finally, Chris Cornell sings so well with his flat-sounding lows and his screaming highs. He's an awesome singer.<BR>Overview:<br />Cochise: 10/10 Great first song. Loud, very noisy, smart. I heard a long version of this song with a much longer intro, starting with just a cool drum beat for a few measures, then an increasingly loud bass, then it dove into the intro presented on my CD. I dunno if this is just my CD or not, but it skips that long intro, which really sucks.<br />Show Me How To Live: 10/10 The best song on the CD. Brilliant guitar part. I love the bends in Cornell's singing part. Unfortunately, it got overplayed and I got a little sick of it. At the end, Cornell does this awesome bending thing with his voice. Sweet.<br />Gasoline: 10/10 The first time I heard this song, I noticed that you really don't have to have a minor song to make it sound great. This song has a heavy chorus with really neat verses. Another really repetitive and smart solo. <br />What You Are: 9/10 This song got famous, which I think is great, cause I think it's a great song, but the band has made better. This song contrasts the soft verses from the loud, powerful chorus. That solo is crazy. Smart singing.<br />Like A Stone: 10/10 I heard this song a lot a year or so before I bought thisCD. By the time I got the CD, I had forgotten about it, but when I heard it again, I noticed one definate thing: I thought that the song was MUCH slower than it is. I think it could be better if it were slower, but it would be, like, a stoner song or something :) I dunno, maybe it might get boring...Na. This song can't get boring. It's still a slower song that has a brilliant guitar part and beautiful singing. It has depressing lyrics, awesome music, what more could you ask for? Oh, yeah, it's got a funky AWESOME solo. Brilliant!<br />Set It Off: 10/10 A close second to &quot;Show Me How To Live.&quot; Awesome head-banger song. Easy to memorize cause you're gonna listen to this baby ten times a day. &quot;SET THIS ****ER OFF!&quot; SWEET! Man, I just fall in love with this band from this song! It's so perfect. Plus, it's not overplayed on the radio. <br />Shadow On the Sun: 9/10 Unfortunately, Set it Off ends :( but Shadow on the Sun begins, and it's not bad at all. It just get a little old. My favorite part in this song is when Cornell rips his vocal chords out, screaming &quot;Shadow On the Sun!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; Awesome solo, too. Probably one of Morello's best solos.<br />I Am the Highway: 8/10 Unfortunately, this song got famous in the place of a better one by these guys. On the radio, they take out the intro which is some beautiful set of chords by Morello. I heard a demo of this song, except it had a distorted guitar tone. I like this version better, especially because of the simple, yet beautiful solo.<br />Exploder: 9/10 A song about death, suicide, and pride. Pretty cool. After the wierd solo. After the third chorus, Cornell does this really wierd voice thing like &quot;gad-in-da-dar. gad-in-da-gar.&quot; Really awesome ending with a few diminished-sounding chords.<br />Hypnotise: 9/10 Good song. The chorus is kinda annoying though. &quot;oh no, don't you keep your good luck to yourself.&quot; There's a short drum solo, where Brad keeps playing the semi-complicated beat for about 10 seconds. There is one part where Morello plays during a chorus this cool stuff.<br />Bring Em Back Alive: 10/10 Great name, eh? I love the verses. Chris uses a modifier to go with his genius singing part. Yet again, a genius guitar solo. Sounds like a noisy toaster breaking.<br />Light My Way: 9/10 Very much like Rage Against the Machine. Cooler though. I like the guitar riff in the verses, where Morello uses this really wierd wah pedal or somethin wierder. Cool chorus. Then, the bridge sounds JUST like Soundgarden. It's wierd: this song has parts that sound just like Rage and Soundgarden.<br />Getaway Car: 6/10 I'm sure that this is a great song, but I hate it. It's very annoying, slow, corny, dumb. I mean come on, &quot;Get yourself a car, and drive it along.&quot; How stupid is that? Maybe I should shut up on this one. The only thing I like about it is the guitar solo. Kinda jazzy-like solo. Also, nice phaser at the end.<br />The Last Remaining Light: 10/10 Great last song. Sounds like Brad switched snare drums. It's a slow song, but unlike Getaway Car, it's awesome. It's beautiful. I love the solos.<br />This CD  is a perfect example of how a band doesn't have make really heavy music to be great. Judge on the music, not on popularity or anything like that. Check out my other reviews at great musical albums. Check me out in Amazon Friends. I'm Little Mitchell.
B00005NWM3|1.0|I am a teenager, and since this product is marketed almost specifically to the teenage audience, I was immediately attracted to `Silver Side Up', this sophomore album from NICKELBACK.  I thought \\"Never Again\\" was pretty stupid, liked \\"Too Bad\\" and loved, obviously, that massively overplayed \\"How You Remind Me\\".  I read reviews that shed positive light on the record, and so I bought it.  I was impressed.  The songs were all well written and really durn cool . . . or, they were at first.  But as time passed, I became less impressed and more annoyed.  The songs kind of sounded all too much alike, so it was like one song that was written 10 times and was really durn overrated.  Then I quit being annoyed, and the only logical step down was complete and utter hatred for this album.  Almost all the songs  follow the same disgusting formula:<br />-Guitar intro<br />-Verse 1<br />-the Chorus<br />-Verse 2<br />-the Chorus once again<br />-the Bridge<br />-Verse 1, sung a second time<br />-Chorus<br />-Chorus<br /> And since EVERY SINGLE SONG follows this EXACT SAME FORMULA EVERY SINGLE TIME WITHOUT EVEN A CHANGE IN DYNAMICS OR SOUND AT ALL, it kinda takes the fun out of the song, the album, rock as a genre, music as an art-form, and just life in general.  The only song I can listen to and enjoy is \\"Too Bad\\", but then I start thinkin \\"hey, maybe this album aint so bad after all . . .\\" and I try listening to more songs, which then leads me to an attempt of slitting my wrists with a thin-toothed comb or a mouse pad.  My opinion of this record in a nutshell, is: \\"I need a heck-of-a-lot more than a nickel back for this atrocity.\\"<br /> Which leads me to wonder why I feel so differently about their third release, `the Long Road'.  Hmmmm . . .
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I am a big Godsmack fan, but I must admit that they sometimes get a bit musically boring. Almost every song is quite similar as far as the flatted 5th and always the minor 3rd and so forth. However, this CD has more variety than others and it's just freakin awesome. Overview:<br />Straight Out of Line: 10/10 I love the introduction. It parrellels with &quot;One&quot; by Metallica off of &quot;...And Justice For All.&quot; Great heavy song. Impressively complicated drumming and great guitar solo. One of my favs out of the group.<br />Faceless: 10/10 The first time I heard this song, I noticed a definate parrellel to &quot;I Stand Alone&quot; as far as chord progressions. One thing I love about Godsmack is Tony's wah pedal sound. He shows it off in most songs, especially in his solos, but in this one he uses it for the main riff, which is simple, but really cool. This song is so heavy, it makes me just wanna scream. Really catchy.<br />Changes: 9/10 One thing I noticed about this song is that everybody seems to think that it's the best song on the album, at least all my friends say that. I disagree. The fist time I heard this song, I noticed that the intro sounded a lot like Trust Company (who I think is not a great band) The verses are the coolest part by a longshot. The main riff just doesn't do it for me. I do love the acoustic riff, though. Lastly, at the very end, I always kept expecting him to say &quot;way&quot; after &quot;in my&quot; cause that's what he does through the song, but it ends on &quot;my&quot; Wierd.<br />Make Me Beleive: 9/10 Catchy. Good drumming. Still simple, but again, so awesome. The bridge makes the song whole. Without it, I would't really like this song as much as I do. The solo is kinda short.<br />I Stand Alone: 10/10 By far their best song. some may say that it is overrated, but they are wrong. THIS SONG ROCKS! I love the drumming in the refrain. The lyrics are sweet.<br />Re-Align: 10/10 Another one of my favs. Great song that gets alot of air time here in St. Louis. The singing really make this song. <br />I ----ing Hate You: 10/10 That is one awesome opening riff followed by another awesome riff. The singing is almost demon-like. Sweet.  Wierd bridge that just repeats the opening riff (verse riff) with modified taking. Not one of the band's complicated songs, but who cares on this one?<br />Releasing the Demons: 10/10 The song starts off with whispering. The verses really sound demon-like. The chorus is typical Godsmack. The bridge is one repeated, palm-muted note in rythym, which is really cool.<br />Dead and Broken: 9/10 The opening riff kinda flows together, which is cool, but the verses have some great guitaring, which is the best part of the song. The first little solo is way too easy. The bridge is cool too. Then the second solo comes, which is some noise and a few quickly picked notes. Not so great of a solo, but still a great song.<br />I Am: 9/10 What a great name. Cool, but could be better. Great lyrics.<br />The Awakening: 1/10 Not really a song, and although it sure is a-typical and different from the rest, I hate it. It's one and a half minutes of some Indian dude singing really bad along to a beat played on what sounds like primitive percussion instruments. I suppose that's Shannon on the percussion, and he's a really good drummer, but this song was a bad mistake.<br />Serenity: 10/10 That hit the spot. Different from the rest. No distortion, and so awesome. Great singing.<br />Great CD, but it could be better and it's definately not the best metal CD I own.
B00005B36H|5.0|First off, I would like to congratulate myself for writing about \\"Lateralus\\" three years after it's release, which puts MY review at the top of this one-thousand-four-hundred-page stack.  ha-HA!!!  But it's not like I had a choice anyway; since I just bought the album a few months back.  But still . . .<br /><br />This is my first and my last TooL record.  It's my first because I somehow stumbled across \\"Thirteenth Step\\" by that one band, oooh what ARE they called? . . . Ah yes, A PERFECT CIRCLE.  The vocalist was genuinely giving me goosebumps, so I dug in deeper, put 2 and 2 together and discovered TooL for the first time.  I read tons of reviews over all three TooL albums, and finally decided to get \\"Lateralus\\" because everyone seemed to think it was the best.  It's my last TooL album because this is also the only TooL record that doesn't blatantly attack Christianity.  I don't take it well when bands basically rape my beliefs and toss them aside like they was nuthin' when they mean so much to me, and that's enough to discourage me from buying an album.  Amazing talent, scary lyrics.  Luckily though, THIS album doesn't offend me at all.<br /><br />A big complaint that I've read from people who are less than impressed with \\"Lateralus\\" is that . . . well, it sucks.  Too long, stupid lyrics, Maynard sounds board, and other dumb crap.  Their explanation for such a massive amount of positive response to such a bad album?  \\"TooL fans,\\" they rationalize, \\"waited five whole years for an album from these guys, so when this crap came out, the fans refused to accept it as it was.  They insisted is was another monumental step for the band, even though they knew it sucked; they all talk about how `talented' and `incredible' and `deep' TooL is.  Well, I guess to a bunch of gothic teenagers that wear black and hate life will think TooL is like, Einstein, or something.  Ha heh huh ha heh . . .\\"<br /><br />Having never been a TooL fan before this album, I can personally guarantee that `Lateralus' is every bit as jaw-dropping, amazing, monumental, astounding and downright awesome as thousands before me have said, and is very easily the best album I have ever bought(even if it's NOT QUITE my favorite).<br /><br />The album starts off with a bang, ends with a bang, and has lots of bangs in between.  From `the Grudge' to `Shism' to `Laturalus' itself, to the eleven-minute epic of `Reflection', this album is chocked full of serious jaw-dropping musical genius . . . and yes, I TOO think that this band is a bunch of Einstein's.  But that's what they are, so gimmie a break.<br /><br />There's really not much else I can say that hasn't been said a billion trillion gazillion times before.  There are hundreds of these really really long reviews over this album, all saying exactly what I'm saying, and there will be hundreds more, and so I hope that if you are actually reading these you'll understand that all of these people canNOT be wrong, at least not about this.  I have never been so sure about the quality of an album as I am about this one.<br /><br />If you're familiar with TooL, then this should please you.  If you're not familiar with TooL, then this should absolutely amaze you.  If you're a complete cynic that writes negative reviews just to stand out of the crowd and be really cool, then you'll hate this album and you really suck.<br /><br />So buy this thing.  It's good.is every bit as jaw-dropping, amazing, monumental, astounding and downright awesome as thousands before me have said, and is very easily the best album I have ever bought(even if it's NOT QUITE my favorite).

B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica are purely original in sound, pioneers in the broad, unexplored spanse of heavy metal music. Ride The Lightning helped Metallica get to the top, where they still are today, so here's an overview from a musical perspective:<br />Fight Fire With Fire: 10/10 How could you not love this song? It starts off with a beautiful array of clean sound. Then it gets really fast, really heavy, and everything great. The only thing I can say against it is that the lyrics are kinda dumb.<br />Ride The Lightning: 10/10 I love the opening lick to this track. The singing part is pure brilliance. I love the solo. Very old school metal genius.<br />For Whom the Bell Tolls: 10/10 The guitar in the beginning (I guess thats a guitar. I dunno, maybe its a bass.) that accompanies the simple notes of the other guitar is really cool. Then, again, the lead guitar helps it shine. Then the verses start with a simple riff, but helped along with great vocals. The refrain is great. Simple, slow, amazing song.<br />Fade to Black: 10/10 YES! This song is worth a billion stars. The chord changes flow so purely, so fluently. One of the best of Hammet's solos begins this masterpiece. The vocals are nearly as brilliant as the guitar riffs. I love it more than almost every other Metallica song. (&quot;One&quot; may surpass.) After four minutes, the song changes into yet another of the greatest riffs, followed by another. It ends in a solo that takes you on a journey. <br />Trapped Under Ice: 10/10 Really fast. This song has a really fast solo to start it off. Not the best song on the CD, but VERY good, and awesome enough for an easy ten. Metallica pulls through mostly on the guitars on this one.<br />Escape: 9/10 Definatly not the best on the album, but wow, is that cool or what!? It makes me wonder how anyone could not consider Metallica as one of the best bands to ever live. The chord changes are few, but the changes in the refrain are really cool. The ending is the best part.<br />Creeping Death: 10/10 great harmonies, then an awesome riff that makes you want to scream. This song is about the Exodus, which makes for an ususual set of lyrics. Another one of the best guitar solos takes place in this song. I think that the chord changes in the refrain don't exactly connect the verses, but the vocals connect to it well. The bridge is the height of the song, besides the solos. At about 6 minutes into the song, Hammet does some pretty basic tapping, which adds to the song as well.<br />The Call of Ktulu: 10/10 A great instrumental. Much better than Puppet's &quot;Orion.&quot; The chords are meant to be together. I love the melodic introduction. Fantastic. Very thoughtful and inspiring solos. This is the longest song on the album at about 9 minutes.It approaches the end in a melodic set of very cool chords. Then, Lars whacks a low tom a few times and they play a few boring ending notes. I wish it ended with the melodic stuff.<br />This is one of the most positive reviews I've given, not marking any song down at all, and that really says something: &quot;This is one of the greatest albums ever!&quot;
B0000B3FCX|3.0|\\"Well, Kroegers and Co. are back once again, intent on destroying our sense of hearing with more repetitive musical poo.\\"<br /> This is the type of response most of my friends gave at hearing the news of NICKELBACK's new album, entitled `the Long Road'(duh).  I was confused, because what I'd heard off of my cheap stereo from this band all sounded pretty good(this was before my purchase of `Silver Side Up').<br /> So I'd heard \\"Someday\\" and was at Wal-Mart, saw the album, and you know the rest.  I brought it home and I loved it.  From the fast opening track of \\"Flat on the Floor\\" to the leadoff single \\"Someday\\" to the heaviest track \\"Because of You\\", I enjoy ALMOST every minute of it.<br /> However, enjoy is a kind of STRONG word for my real feelings for the record.  A couple of rough spots though are found with \\"Figured You Out\\", a typical sex-song that I find to be completely moronic and musically forgettable.  I can't believe that one's a single . . . my other problem is \\"Another Hole in the Head\\", which isn't really stupid as much as it is un-memorable, so I usually skip it.<br />I've also noticed that almost EVERY SINGLE SONG has the same exact little guitar strumming/chugging thingy before they fall into the chorus, which has become massively annoying.  And my recent purchase of `Single Side Up' hasn't helped this disc at all, as there has been almost no change in their sound at all whatsoever from that album to this one.<br /> In fact, based on my dislike for that album, I really don't know why I like this one as much as I do.  Maybe it cuz they try their hand at some slower songs(\\"Should've Listened\\", \\"Feelin' Way Too Dang Good\\").  Maybe it's cuz the songwriting is just a tiddle bit better.  Maybe it's cuz I was paid to like it.  Who's to know?<br /> The point is, if you hate NICKELBACK to begin with, then you're on the wrong page anyway.  If you're an old fan of theirs, you might like this even more then previous albums.  This album would've gotten 4 stars had not `Silver Side Up' influenced me so negatively on my view of this band.<br />So, give this one a try.  If you don't wanna, go listen to FUEL instead.ad not `Silver Side Up' influenced me so negatively on my view of this band.  <BR>So, give this one a try.

1592400876|5.0|Lynne Truss has got it absolutely right with this witty and insightful look at the use and misuse of punctuation.<br />Too often, people defend the ghastly misuses of, say, apostrophes these days with the assertion that languages evolve. Indeed they do, but that is no excuse for the kind of sloppiness that renders the language incomprehensible at times. That's not evolution, it's degradation.<br />Lynne Truss shows us why punctuation matters as a tool in the written language. I'd recommend this book both as a good read and as a concise reference work. It deals, of course, with British English. Maybe one day someone will produce a similar work on American English, or a comparative overview. Now that really would be worth reading.
0385510438|1.0|I was ready for a great story in typical Grisham style.  What I got was a chick flick.  I usually quit a book like this after 90 to 100 pages.  I should have this time.  However, I kept hoping the story would get better.  Save your money and re-read the firm.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I think that some of the naysayers are trying to read too much into this movie.  It is filled with bigger than life tall tales, none of which are believable, but that is the whole point.  It is all about a son trying to see who his dying father really IS.  It is a story of healing and reconciliation, NOT about conjoined twins or a ring-swallowing catfish.  For several years, I have lived with the pain of non reconciling with my father before he died, and this movie brought me closure.  For that, I am deeply grateful to Tim Burton.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|Most Made for Television have a lot cheese in them and after a few days the viewer forgets about them. But &quot;The Day After&quot; is different. Made in the early 1980's it shows the effects on nuclear war on the Kansas City area. These are just average people who are put worst situration that could ever happen. Starting Jason Robards, Steve Guttenburg, and JoBeth Williams we see how their characters would survive if it really happen.  The DVD tranfer is great, but there are no extras. But don't let that stop you &quot;The Day After&quot; is a must for any fan of the end of the world stories.
B00005R1N3|5.0|Black Christmas is a movie about a killer who hides in the attic of a sorority house on Christmas and kills people one by one in typical slasher horror movie style.  Besides the fact that Black Christmas was one of the first slasher movies and set the standard for the rest, you might ask yourself why Black Christmas is even worth a viewing.  There are two reasons in particular.  First, everything that happens in the movie is completely realistic.  The killer is not invincible like Freddy or Jason, he is just well-hidden.  We are spared the usual &quot;wait, he was shot, stabbed, and thrown from a window, how can he still be alive?&quot;.  When sisters begin disappearing, there is a completely logical explanation (&quot;she went to meet her father, remember?&quot; or &quot;she must have left for home a few hours earlier than she had told us&quot;).  Second, there is a large amount of mystery surrounding the events of the movie, which makes it seem that much more realistic.  The killer is never revealed, and the baby of which the killer speaks in some of his obscene phone calls is never explained.  Black Christmas comes highly reccommended, especially if you are sick of the typical slasher fare.
0872860175|5.0|And as one of the most profound poem of the 20th century began...<br />\\"I saw the best minds of my generation<BR>destroyed by madness, <BR>while starving hysterically naked,<BR>and roaming the streets with an angry fix...\\"<br />Allen Ginsberg, master poet and storyteller of the Beat Generation, became the omnipotent force of the newly formatted Beatnik movement that, through insanity, madness, and periods of solitude, rose from the depth of the west coast, specifically in the woefully sexy city of Berkeley, CA, to the cumulative vortex that remained in pieces on the seductive streets of NYC's Lower East Side community. <br />\\"Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade to shade, lights out in houses, we'll both be lonely.\\"<br />The poem-dense book, \\"Howl & Other Poems\\" not only includes both parts of \\"Howl\\" but includes other classical works such as \\"Kaddish\\" (a beautifully rendered tribute to Ginsberg's mother- a figure whom he continued to question the delicate balances of her love toward him and vice versa) and \\"A Supermarket in California\\" where he composes a rather brief poem, spanning from his powerful visions of him and Walt Whitman walking upon the solitary streets, wondering what has become of their things as he allows Whitman's \\"beard to point them in the right direction.\\"<br />\\"The madman bum and angel beat in Time, unknown, yet putting down here what might be left to say in time, coming after death.\\"<br />Overall this book is the equivalent of a historical text-book, in terms of the Beat Generation's poetry. It also contains several short poems that were written under the influence of... certain substances and poems related to Ginsberg's sexual experiences, as well. <br />The one interesting side to the book itself is that, in my opinion, not only it is a reflection of a singular man's views, experiences, desires, and emotions, but it is a mirror of the vastly unknown and abnormally tucked-away world, that the reader can reflectupon. This book is worth owning. Another Amazon quick pick I'd like to recommend is The Losers Club by Richard Perez
0312983867|4.0|Anyone starting the Stephanie Plum series with HARD EIGHT is sure to get hooked. It's Stephanie at her wackiest.<br />Plum is a disaster-prone bounty hunter working for her cousin Vinnie, a bail bondsman in Trenton, NJ. In this novel, Stephanie volunteers to help out her parents' next door neighbor, Mabel, who's put up her home to guarantee a child custody bond taken out on her granddaughter, Evelyn, who had one imposed on her by the judge in a recent divorce ruling. Now, Evelyn has skipped town with her daughter, Annie, and Mabel will be tossed into the street if the missing child isn't found. But, as becomes evident in all of Stephanie's adventures, there's more to the story than is obvious. Especially after the corpse of Evelyn's aggrieved husband, Steven, is left on the couch of Plum's apartment. Steven had been sawed in half.<br />The imagination of author Janet Evanovich worked overtime in making HARD EIGHT perhaps one of the craziest to date. It's a nice touch that Stephanie faces off against a virtual menagerie. And she's finally beginning to take her .38, usually kept unloaded in a cookie jar, seriously. And her unfortunate association with fire-bombed vehicles reaches a record high. Notwithstanding these plot devices, however, books one to eight in the series are basically interchangeable. (I'm struggling, perhaps unsuccessfully, to keep from writing the same review over and over.)<br />Evanovich needs to mature her heroine, who seems to have a slow learning curve. I suggest that Plum finally marry, or at least permanently set up house, with Detective Joe Morelli. It might not be a relationship made in heaven, but it would supply grist for any number of new episodes. And Lula, Stephanie's sometime partner in her Keystone Cop takedowns, is growing tiresome, as is the fact that the author refuses to bring Stephanie's Dad more into the limelight.<br />Mind you, I'm still finding the Plum novels immensely enjoyable in a mindless sort of way. But even the best of a good thing, like a premium chocolate chip cookie, begins to get stale after awhile. Perhaps I've read too many in too short a time, and should alternate with the likes of WAR AND PEACE and the works of Plato.of a good thing, like a premium chocolate chip cookie, begins to get stale after awhile.

B0001WTUH6|5.0|First off, this wasn't intended to be a vampire/werewolf movie, it was intended to be an action movie with vampires/werewolves. That said, this is a really fun movie! You may have heard it said that all the creator did was splice 'the Matrix' and 'Blade' together, and while i can see why people would think that, the result is, in some ways, greater than the sum of its parts. The characters are good and authentic (thanks to good acting), the story is good, the action is great. What's even better: the last scene all but puts up a neon sign saying \\"SEQUEL\\". Yay! Although the inevitable sequel won't have the awesomely high originality factor that this, the original, has, it will still be awesome. SO, whether you get this extended version or the original, you will be satisfied.
0671891634|5.0|It's hard to find a better written book on investing that Beating the Street.  Despite working in the industy for many years, Peter Lynch urges people to do it for themselves.  He writes clearly giving examples of how one could do better than the Wall Street pros.  This book is one of the best on investing that I have read.
B00005JKN9|2.0|I agree with all the other reviewers below who were disappointed in this movie. They have spelled out all the reasons why I, too, was let down by it.<br />I also agree with a previous reviewer who recommended instead the great Brazilian movie &quot;City of God&quot;. That person is right: &quot;City&quot; is everything &quot;Gangs&quot; should have been. It brilliantly tells the story of two generations of violent gangsters in a squalid, no-hope slum, and how people got sucked into a life of crime and could never escape. It is an unforgettable movie, unlike Scorsese's recent dud.
B00005MP58|5.0|This production of Pride and Prejudice is incredibly well done.  The scenery, the mansions, the costumes--all are spectacular.  The actors are all perfect in their roles, especially Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy.  With commercials, the series was originally six hours long, so they didn't have to skimp on anything.  This is one miniseries that truly lives up to the book.  Jane Austen would be proud.
0792841859|1.0|Like &quot;JFK&quot; and &quot;Murder in the First,&quot; MB shows us how the phrase &quot;basedon/inspiredby a true story&quot; REALLY means &quot;at most maybe 2% of this story is true, and the rest is BS.&quot;  <br />Before you say that it doesn't really matter if a film like MB doesn't stick as closely to the facts as it could have, consider this: if you read the rest of the reviews of this movie, or of the other two mentioned above, you will find about half of the time, it is quite clear that people are getting their history from such films.  Time and again, reviewers repeat the demonstrably false statements made on the back of the box or that come from the film's press kit.  <br />The reason this matters is simple.  When one adapts a book for a screenplay -- an art in itself -- one has to make certain changes due to the fact that each media has its own unique limitations. The important thing, then, is not so much faithfulness to the literal text, but faithfulness to the SUBTEXT and SPIRIT of the original material.  However, if you're going to base a film on real events and people, it is vitally important to get the essential facts straight!  The post-modern notion that &quot;mythic truth&quot; (see &quot;JFK&quot;) is more important than historical facts is right out of George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;!<br />Aside from the fact that the story is almost entirely populated by liberal Hollywood stereotypes, it misses the mark on this important point.  The case was not broken by clever investigative techniques, contrary to what Hoover would have us believe.  But neither was the case broken by Gestapo tactics, as depicted in the film.  It was broken by bribing one of the participants to &quot;rat out&quot; his fellow conspirators!<br />I could have given this film four stars IF it had fictionalized itself to the point of NOT trying to reference itself as basedon/inspiredby &quot;a true story.&quot;  <br />When I saw this film in Milwaukee the summer of its release, I was one of only maybe a dozen or two people in the audience.  In one scene, after taking one of the killers on a car ride and tricking him into giving them information, the FBI agents drop him off in the black part of town.  As they drive off, he looks around nervously at all the residents who are eyeing him with suspicion and curiosity.  A half-dozen rows behind me, a black teenage boy shouted out, &quot;Get him!&quot;  Maybe he was just making a bad joke in poor taste.  Maybe he didn't stop to think how his comments might sound to others in the audience.  Maybe he even meant me.  But maybe it should be obvious by now why this sort of propagandistic film-making is dangerous.  I also can't help thinking how many white supremacists who know how far from the truth this film is in some places have been further confirmed in their racist views by the fact that film-makers felt they had to lie to make their point....<br />Parker, Hackman, and Defoe are all talented people, but when they lend their talents to an effort such as this, are they really any different from Leni Riefenstahl...?<br />I never needed Hollywood to tell me that racism is wrong.  And I'm sick and tired of being presumed guilty of racism until I can prove I'm a liberal Democrat and a card-carrying member of the ACLU.  Telling the TRUE story -- let's say, at least 90% true -- of what happened in MB would be a far more compelling film, as well as a far more persuasive argument against racism.  Instead, we are treated to the usual Hollywood sterotype that the problem of racism is strictly a matter of non-liberal whites oppressing their black moral superiors.  And so, in the end, the film actually manages to do more to help perpetuate the cycle of racism than expose or defuse it.  <br />The solution is simple, people: treat each and every individual as an individual, and not as a member of any group, and without any preconceived notions about characteristics which the individual has not yet displayed.<br />If it had actually happened the way it was depicted in the film, &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; would be more deserving of the accolades that some reviewers have heaped upon it.  But, at the risk of being labeled &quot;politically incorrect&quot; myself, I must give MB only one star, precisely because the film itself is &quot;politically correct.&quot;
B000002KDO|5.0|This is one of the sludgiest, heaviest albums known to man. 30 years after this album was released, it is still heavier than a lot of stuff out there. It has this doomy, sludgy, impossibly heavy sound to it that cannot be duplicated. Ozzy's voice sounds just perfect on this. So does Tony Iommi's guitar playing. Bill Ward's drums, too. The drums sound especially thumping, with that underwater sound in them. This album contains many of the bands best songs such as Children Of the Grave, Into The Void, Sweet Leaf, and the odd, flute-heavy ballad Solitude. No true metalhead should be without this masterpiece.
B00006RIO7|5.0|This CD only has 2 songs that I found to be really awful. #17 and #18. I don't what they were thinking when they put those 2 on the CD. The other songs are catchy and jazzy, and for $13, it's worth your money. Everyone complains about Class, but I like it. It has a certain appeal. The instrumental songs are great, they aren't boring and dull like some. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Queen Latifah, Richard Gere, Renee Zellweger and John C. Reilly do a great job singing, especially Catherine. Overall, if you're looking for a good CD with great jazzy numbers, I recommend this one.
B00000DS9H|5.0|No Rest For The Wicked was the album Ozzy released in 1988, after the glam-influenced Ultimate Sin, and the commercial highpoint No More Tears. The album is heavy, with lots of screaming and crunching noises. I feel that it is Ozzy's best work. It was also his heaviest at the time. The album kicks off with Miracle Man, a great song with interesting lyrics. I like the way Ozzy's voice sounds in that one. Then come one of Ozzy's most underrated songs ever, Devil's Daughter. It is one of my favorites and nobody seems to like it. Then comes Crazy Babies, which is the famous song off this album, but I feel that it simply cannot match up to the other songs on the album. The song afterward is Breakin All The Rules, which is one of Ozzy's best ever songs. The chorus is simply awesome.The next song, Bloodbath In Paradise is good, too. Then comes the album's masterpiece: Fire In The Sky. The song begins with a chorus singing &quot;bum bum bum bum bum&quot; with gongs going off in the background. The song is an epic about a man who never had answers to his questions. I really feel this is Ozzy Osbourne's best. Then comes Tatooed Dancer, which is okay, I guess, but doesn't match up to the song that came before it. The last real song on the album is Demon Alcohol, a good song with great guitar playing. Then there is a bonus track: An unnnamed song that everyone just calls 'Hero'. I think it's very good. This album is one of metal's best.
B00006V9A0|5.0|OK, first off, why all the negative reviews!!?!, what the hell is wrong with this album? They just contain some of the best Nirvana tracks re-mastered and one freaky track &quot;You know your'e right&quot;, in other words an enjoyable album! I have no idea in hell why u guys are giving it 1 -3 stars! It isnt bad! They are all Nirvana fans fave songs, well maybe not all, but they are damn good songs!<br />But we will cut to the chase, what this Greatest hits record really is about.... &quot;You know your'e right&quot;, the final Nirvana recording (as we know) and the most scary. It is real weird! hearing him say he's never been so well, and swell is not right has not long later he blew his head off. OK, not a B A D song but far from the greatness of &quot;Smells like teen spirit&quot; or &quot;Heart Shaped-box&quot; Thats all I'm sayin!
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|It all comes down to one thing. Black men wanting to have sex with white women any way they can. I really liked the special effects in this movie though. The best one was of Robert Downy Jr. driving a car. I mean like c'mon we're supposed to believe the sirector could keep him off cocaine long enough for him to actually get behind the wheel? It was the most effective Blue-screen effect I have ever witnessed.
B0000028M7|5.0|This is hands down the greatest grunge album of all time and one of the greatest albums of all time. How could someone say this isnt the best alice album of all time. Some people just say that cause they think it makes them look cool. They dont wanna give this album its credit because it went mainstream. Well I will be the first to admit that most of the grunge albums that went mainstream are over rated but this one isnt. If you are a new alice listener get this album first then work your way into the others you will be happier that way. After u hear this album you will love the rest of the alice stuff trust me. And finally I am gonna settle a little debate Layne Staley is a better writer and 10 times the  vocalist that  Kurt Cobain was and you people should be ashamed of yourselves for not giving him the credit he deserves. So buy this album best ever. ALICE IN CHAINS FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|Well some movies have it all and some movies have stuff you never thought you'd want to see, like a nude Danny DeVito. I grew up in the South and have never heard of stories such as conjoined twins from North Korea, or a witch who'll show you your own death through a glass eye. My wife kept elbowing me in the ribs throughout this film. She couldn't believe someone could spin as much bull as I do. Well there's your proof. I don't see how this movie can be called 'moving'. I mean the son might have learned a lesson in that maybe his father was more than a teller of tall tales, but then again who wants to hear the story of one's own birth a million times whether it's true or not?
B000068TP0|5.0|I had Shakira's MTV Unplugged CD for a while before I finally purchased the DVD on amazon.com. Why did I wait so long??? This performance that Shakira put together is one of her best. The songs are very acoustic. You don't have to speak Spanish to enjoy Shakira's songs. The concert starts with an Eastern-inspired musical intro and ends with the crowning performance of the night--Ojos Asi, complete with a truly AMAZING bellydance sequence. That, along with the Mariachi band Los Mora Ariaga singing Siega, Sordomuda, are the two highlights of the performance. Shakira's Spanish songs are her best, and I would suggest them to anyone who wants to get to know her music. The DVD has English subtitles, so don't worry! And there are bonus features, like interviews and an Unplugged rehearsal.<BR>Within one week, I received Shakira MTV Unplugged and Live and Off The Record DVDs in the mail, and I couldn't have made better purchases! You will never regret buying this DVD.
B00003CXCT|1.0|The original was great but take my advice and wait for the final revision of this box set. I should come out 2-3 years after this one is released(ala Sept '06). It should also contain another interview with George Lucas in which he proclaims himself god. How can someone so successful be so insecure?
B0001US8FI|4.0|If you were expecting some new revelations from this latest release of Enter the Dragon you'll have to look elsewhere. Although there is a new 1/2 hour documentary on the making of ETD everything else has been released before, much of it on the 25th anniversary edition of the film. For fans of Bruce it is nice to have so many special features on one double-disc set, however, if you are a devoted Bruce Lee fan you may already own the included documentaries &quot;Curse of the Dragon&quot; which was broadcast on A&amp;E, or the film &quot;Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey&quot; which contains nearly all of Bruce's footage from Game of Death interpreted as Bruce intended it.<br />The transfer is crisp but I could see no significant improvements over the 25th edition transfer, the commentary by Paul Heller is the same version as the 25th anniversary edition as well, and I found the Dolby 5.1 digital soundtrack rather soft and thin sounding. The new documentary &quot;Blood and Steel:  Making Enter the Dragon&quot; does have a few things you haven't seen before including a couple of outtakes from the film and interviews with writer Michael Allin and friend and co-star Sammo Hung, as well as co-star Ahna Capri's Super 8 footage taken on location, long rumored to contain footage of Bruce in an actual fight with one of the film's extras (Bruce was routinely challenged throughout the filming by extras who were often Triad gang members). Alas, the documentary contains no such footage, finally putting to rest the hope that we would one day be able to see Bruce in a &quot;real fight&quot;. <br />I may be wrong, but after 30 years I'm convinced there is no &quot;new&quot; Bruce Lee footage left. But then again unreleased material from Jimi Hendrix continues to pop up once in a while. Well, we can only hope....... We love you Bruce. Peace.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|The First Avenged Sevenfold album that nobody even knows about is a little less than this. In the previous one, more of the screaming is in it. In Waking the Fallen, actually more singing is involved, which in this case is AWSOME. The music style has definitly changed. But not for the worst. In this Album A7X is going for a more metal sound, but trys to keep its old school kick. How the music is played is incredible with awsome guitar solos, drum performance, and Killer riffs. Buy this album from the new yet old kick a$$ band Avenged Sevenfold, it will keep you on the edge of your seat.
6305388458|5.0|This is a very funny movie.  It takes place int he Stone Age.  About a guy named Brian and this is his life.  Most of the humor is because his name is brian and people confuse him for somebody else.  &quot;I'm not so anso I'm Brian.&quot;  Also there is a very funny moment when a man says his wife is called Continual Buttocks (a butocks is a bottom) or soemthing.  Some of the humor is called toilet humor that I'm not a fan of.  My friends and I only thought that Bodge would have looked great in this film with his beard and BRITISH accent!!!  Where was he?  He would have been perfect!
B0001AVZA8|5.0|For all the reviews citing cliches in this film, it was surprising to me that the majority failed to mention that the screenplay was extraordinary.  There are a couple of twists in the traditional plot lines of your typical romantic comedy, but what I felt was so special about this one in particular was that it didn't insult my intelligence.  I felt the relationships were believable - especially the December/May relationship relationship that unfolded between Reeves and Keaton.  Is it that hard to believe?  Older women marrying younger men is a growing trend and I applaud the script for taking that chance. I also liked that there wasn't two of the more common romantic comedy plot devices: 1) a misunderstanding ala &quot;Three's Company&quot; or the 2) soap opera style standoffs between love triangles.  Not a single one in this movie and I thought that the script treated the characters with a level of maturity that was more in line with reality than Hollywood.<BR>If you want to see Jack and Keanu fight at the end or Amanda Peet chew out her Mom (Keaton) - you won't get it.  Go watch a Meg Ryan movie instead.  <BR>Other highlights from my perspective:<BR>A clever incorporation of IM and the internet without it being the focal point of the movie.<BR>Some wonderful beach scenes that will remain classic - 50 years from now they will be used for an Oscar night montage.<BR>Character arcs - they may seem simplistic and perhaps packaged quickly (esp. with the Peet character), but all the characters develop.<BR>The cerebral flavor of the movie in general.  If the average moviegoer can't appreciate the importance of &quot;eating pancakes&quot; in a certain scene then perhaps I suggest they are missing the point of that scene.<BR>I am a big Jack fan and you think he is playing himself, but until those credits are rolling at the end does he flash that trademark smile in the restaurant. Not only did that simple act get applause in the theater when I saw the movie, but symbolizedthat he is complete - being himself again despite severing his bachelor ways.  That was a brilliant subtlety that personified the whole movie, in my opinion.
B000084T18|5.0|WHAT A GREAT CD!!!! Remember G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G UNIT!!! Also cop College Dropout, Living Legends by 8Ball and MJG.
B00018D44U|5.0|&quot;Feels Like Home,&quot; Norah Jones' follow-up to her Grammy-guzzling 2002 debut &quot;Come Away With Me,&quot; should please fans and win her new ones.<br />The disc is similar to its predecessor, but it also takes notable strides in other directions. If you found yourself dozing off to Jones' music in the past, there's a far less chance of doing it here, as the new album is less dreamy and languid.<br />The first evidence that Jones and her band are turning things up a notch is the urgent &quot;What Am I To You?&quot; -- a Jones original that features electric guitar. A more subdued version of the song appeared on certain Asian versions of &quot;Come Away With Me.&quot;<br />The disc's tempo picks up far more with &quot;In the Morning,&quot; a catchy contribution from band member Adam Levy. Later, we get to the happy-go-lucky &quot;Creepin In,&quot; which features an excellent guest appearance by Dolly Parton. This is a fun track, and it's easy to imagine the two artists dancing arm in arm down a country road.<br />The disc also contains a handful of tracks that would have fit splendidly with the more uniform &quot;Come Away With Me.&quot; One such tune is the melodic &quot;Those Sweet Words,&quot; which is a perfect showcase for Jones' vocal talent. The priceless &quot;Carnival Town&quot; drips with as much sugar and charm as &quot;Sunrise,&quot; with its laid-back arrangements and ethereal harmony.<br />&quot;The Prettiest Thing&quot; will relax you with its warmth and simplicity, and &quot;Don't Miss You at All,&quot; which finds Jones writing her own lyrics to Duke Ellington's &quot;Melancholia,&quot; makes a perfect closer to the album.<br />What the listener gets with &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; is pure musical excellence. The hype of Jones and her &quot;Handsome Band&quot; of skilled musicians is justified all the more with this release.<br />Whether or not you loved &quot;Come Away With Me,&quot; there's something for everyone here.
0399226907|5.0|This was the first book that we ever bought our daughter and we have read it to her so many times.  Even though she is only 7 months old she sits on our lap and actually looks at the pictures.  It is also great that the book is a board book so that when she grabs for it no damage is done.  I would also recommend getting the plush rattle caterpillar toy and the plush pull/shake caterpillar toy.  It is a great way to tie toys to a story, even at a young age.
B000066NW0|4.0|I really like this CD.  I especially like the first three songs-&quot;Losing Grip&quot;, &quot;Complicated&quot;, and &quot;Sk8ter Boi&quot;.  The other songs are great too1  This is a CD u can listen 2 over&amp; over again &amp; never get bored.
0307120007|5.0|This is a cute classic book.  It is fun to read and fuzzy bunny is fun for kids.
B0001LQJQM|2.0|When Michael Chrichton's TIMELINE lit up the best seller list in 2002, he portrayed a world not unlike that of his earlier JURASSIC PARK.  In both texts, he transported an intrepid group of scientist-adventurers into a realm than both threatened them and uplifted them.  The film version of JURASSIC PARK managed to maintain this linked thread of danger and wonder, but in the case of TIMELINE, what director Richard Donner has done was to unlink this thread by eliminating both senses and substituting a messy soup of multiple points of view, none of which succeed in engaging the viewer.<br />The primary problem had nothing to do with the usual trouble spot of time travel movies: the paradoxes inherent in changing the past to avoid a sure catastrophe.  What is at issue here is Donner's inability to present a tightly focused persona with whom the audience could connect.  There was no Sam Neill from JURASSIC PARK who could filter the many divergent viewpoints.  The relatively unknown Paul Johnston, with his surfer dude mode of speaking, simply lacks the gravitas to carry the film.  There were far too many scenes that made no sense.  I had trouble keeping up with identifying the armed knights as French or English.  And when the viewer cannot easily discern one set of potential antagonists from the other, then the director, by default, must rely on special effects to distract the viewer from the logical flaws large enough to steer a time machine through.<br />The plot mirrors on a superficial level Chrichton's book. An evil scientist-industrialist accidentally creates a time tunnel that can open a portal to 14th century France.  Small groups of 20th century flunkies are whisked back to medieval times where they are stranded, one of whom is the father of the surfer-dude, who cleverly leaves behind some incriminating 600 year old clues to convince his beach boy son to lead a rescue mission.  If the director goes to the trouble of leading the audience to think that one character ought to be the lead, then that character ought to do so. Instead, surfer dude defaults his leader role to a variety of others, all of whom are infinitely more interesting.  There are several subplots that momentarily cause one to forget the lack of a central dramatic vision.  What emerges at the end is a time travel film that shouts out for a firmer hand that should have gripped the director's helm.  Donner was not the firm hand and TIMELINE suffers for that.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This has to be the most unbelievable and boring movie ever!  I have spent time in Japan and was never able to complete 10% of what I wanted to do.  Here we have two people who can find nothing interesting in all of Japan.  They are just two people who are depressed with their lives and we are forced to suffer with them.  I could not care less how depressed they are with their lives.  The only thing I was waiting for throughout the movie and sadly never happened was for them to both jump from their hotel windows killing themselves.  I am most thankful that I only rented this movie, so I am only out 2 Euros for this bomb.  Why, oh why can we not select 0 stars???
1559277254|4.0|Stephanie Plum novels are terrific to listen to while working out. A walk or a run goes by more quickly while listening to these light and funny mysteries.  Sure, the characters sometimes don't seem to learn how to avoid their many mishaps, but their mishaps are entertaining!
B00006879E|5.0|The first two songs have gotten tons of radio air time and I bought the CD after I heard a third song played on the radio and was able to recognize that it was them without the DJ's help.  I love the first two songs, obviously, but I am now more impressed with several of the other songs further down the play list. The first time I listened through the whole CD and thought that all of the songs were good but were very similar except for track 6 which reminded me of Sting for some reason (probably lyrics).  So I put Sting in my rotation with it and a couple of the Bare Naked Ladies CD's.  I have decided that they sound nothing like Sting but rotate REALLY well with BNL.  Their style is similar but less hyper although, musically, more complicated.  I really feel that this band is extremely talented and very versatile. On the r&amp;b mix, I wouldn't call it r&amp;b like at all, but very much a good jazz influence.  The real talent, I think, is apparent in many of the songs that they don't have sound bytes for.  I really think that this CD is a good buy and that, if you like the songs for which sound bytes are provided or if you like BNL, you are almost guaranteed to like all of the songs on the CD.
B000002MP2|4.0|The best song on this cd in my opinion was &quot;Basket Case&quot; I just can't get enough of it! It's a great album and I highly recommend it. If you like this one you'll probably like just about any other Green Day album. I recently perchased Nimrod and Warning. Hope this helped!
B000007S5B|5.0|This 1968 release found Manzarek, Morrison and Co. in a rather adventurous mood. This third studio album was easily their most eclectic, ranging from hard charging rock stompers (&quot;Not To Touch The Earth&quot;, &quot;Five To One&quot;) to softer, more melodic fare (&quot;Summer's Almost Gone&quot;, &quot;Love Street&quot;) and all out bizarre, moody set pieces (&quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; &amp;&quot;Spanish Caravan&quot;).They even kick things off with a catchy throwaway (&quot;Hello, I Love You&quot;)which became their second Number 1 single! The collection of sounds and textures on this LP are quite varied and gives me a distinct feeling that the band was stretching far beyond the basic blues rock/pop formula perfected on it's first two albums, but remarkably, the entire thing holds together and never gets boring or repetitive. A Solid Classic.
0385335482|1.0|The only reason I finished reading this book was because I was stuck on an delayed airplane and had nothing better to do. It seemed like a dumbed-up, cheaper version of Bridget Jones's Diary and only took me two and a half hours to read. The main character, Becky, was infuriating. I wanted to slap her and yell &quot;SNAP OUT OF IT!!&quot; I had panic attacks thinking about how much money she was spending. The ending was completely ridiculous. I want my $11.95 back.
B000084T18|5.0|Its rare to find a CD in which you can go the whole way without skipping a song. The beats, the lyrics, all of it is great. Definately worth the money. Every song has its unique sound and feel, and tho the lyrics can be repetitive at times, this is what 50 feels, this is what fuels him, and it does a good job.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|If you're down and need a great laugh...this one is for you!<BR>Of course, you need to be at least 50+ yrs. to appreciate the storyline.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|AC/DC has done it again. If the video for Donnington was good, this is unbelievable. Angus is top notch-duck-walk, head bobbing, screaming and all. The band is solid, with Brian cranking out like always. The sound overall is great. If it is overdubbed, which is possible, its still AC/DC, and the music is all here. Favorites like &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; and &quot;Back In Black&quot; shine, and even some lesser-known tunes are hammered out in this spectacular performance. There's some commentary on the show (done by Angus and Malcolm) and some info and commentary on their discography (also done by Angus and Mal), as well as a new, great feature. Dubbed &quot;Angus Cam&quot;, you can view certain tracks with the camera focusing on a certain band member (such as Thunderstruck with Angus) This option is great, and adds to the already immense DVD. A must have for a fan of AC/DC, or just someone who can't wait to sit down and be sucked into the world of Rock and Roll.
B00005OMTT|4.0|Michael Cretu/Enigma was never really about making \\"hits.\\" There are exactly two real hit records to be found on \\"Love Sensuality Devotion\\" (\\"L.S.D.,\\" snickers the high school prankster buried in there somewhere), and they are \\"Return To Innocence\\" from \\"Cross Of Changes\\" and the international smash \\"Sadeness\\" from the debut. But there are enough instantly recognizable songs here that \\"L.S.D.\\" is indeed a worthy buy for those who don't want to sit through all four of Enigma's relatively same sounding albums that precede this set.<br />The \\"Greatest Hits\\" format also allows what is Cretu's skill as a songwriter and producer to come through. Like Alan Parsons, Cretu is a master at atmosphere and this disc makes good on that gift. Despite the verisimilitude of the individual albums, the unique songs here have markedly different elements. \\"I Love You, I'll Kill You\\" has a stinging guitar solo, \\"Sadeness\\" the undeniable sex appeal, and the remix of \\"TNT For The Brain\\" an almost industrial new age hybridosity. All the tracks have been remixed/remastered to optimize the flow of \\"L.S.D.\\" for the duration of its disc delighting 70 plus minutes. For an anthology, what more could you ask for?<br />\\"Love Sensuality Devotion\\" is a perfect place to start for an Enigma neophyte. If you're hungry for more, then go for the first two albums.
B000060P79|1.0|simple plan is being declared the #1 rock band of this era.  wow... what is this world turning into???  if they didnt try to have a rock image, with the umm...stud belts?? guitars(believe me, they dont know how to use them anyways)?? thats about as cheesy as it gets.  they might be able to brainwash a bunch of 7 year olds to buy this stuff, but please, if you want to buy a cd to listen to actual music...dont buy this!  the lyrics are just like the music, it sounds like its been written by a five year old like this line: 'I'm not gonna stop, you can't make me!' if you want pop, look somewhere else, if you want rock, definetly look somewhere else
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is one of the most creative movies that I've seen in a long time.  It evoked many emotions, made a lasting impression on me, and was a complete mind trip. To get a taste, visit [...] and you will see what I mean.  I haven't been able to get this movie out of my mind since I've seen it on HBO, and finally had to buy the DVD just so I could hear the commentary.  The film did very poor when released, but has had a cult following since and did extremely well with DVD sales.  It was re-released this year with additional scenes, and I will probably by the director's cut DVD as well when it comes out. Additionally, it has a great soundtrack.
B00006690G|4.0|Man I'm not even that much of an Eminem fan but I wanna know why is every hating on this cat.  This album is hot, I dont give a F***.  The charisma, energy and lyrics on this album are sick.  That is the honest truth. No this is definitly not one of the most amazing hip hop albums ever made but it is good.  Personally I don't think a'lot of people especially white people like eminem because he is white. Im just throwing it out there.  When youre on top people like to take you down. People used to talk about Pac now every one rides his jock after hes dead.  And if youre comparing this to most the garbage rap out there em comes pretty hard.  Blows D12,G unit, fabulous, hot boys all that crap out the water.  RECOGNIZE.
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|Director:  Clint Eastwood<BR>Cast:  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney.<BR>Running Time:  125 minutes.<BR>Rated R for violence and language.<br />\\"Mystic River\\" delves into the unspeakable world of a boyhood friendship secret, in which three young boys were confronted by a mysterious, dark man who proceeds to kidnap one of the children and torture him for days.  As the story moves to present day Boston, the audience learns that the three boys have moved on with their lives, working in different professions and starting families, but the undying enigma of their past haunts their every move.<br />Sean Penn stars as a local crook-turned-fairly successful businessman who tragically loses his teenage daughter when she is found murdered near a bar.  The initial clues lead to his molested childhood friend (played brilliantly by the creepy Tim Robbins), who was out late that night and has begun to act extremely strange around his wife and friends.  Hot on the murder case is the third of the youth trio, a slick officer (Kevin Bacon) who has separated from his wife and searching for more than just answers to a crime.  As Penn uses the underground to hopefully find the killer and put his despair to rest, Bacon's character must interrogate his disturbed long-time friend, in hopes that he really is not the vicious killer.<br />Clint Eastwood's direction is articulate and scrupulous, making \\"Mystic River\\" one of the more strikingly effective films of the year.  The first two-thirds of the film are superb, with the Oscar-winning Penn (in the role that he was born to play) morphing from a father full of anguish, into an unwavering maniac in seek of the truth.  The ending is not a disappointment, but certainly unexpected and unusual-perhaps leaving a bad taste in some mouths.  \\"Mystic River\\" is a taut, intense film that will certain strike with its excellent cast and direction, but the slightly uneven adaptation of the Dennis Lehane novel may leave some wanting more.
B000002J1U|5.0|it seems to some people that the less heavy blues based rock tracks ar on a LZ LP, the worse it is. the first half of the album contains some rockers, but this album gets knocks for it's second half being acoustic. this is one of the reasons why this paricular album is underrated in Led Zeppelin terms. but the fact it is underrated has preserved it's beauty. the lone hit contained in this album was Immigrant Song. fast-paced heavy tune, but the norse mythology thing wears on me after a bit. my personal favorite frenetic rockers include Celebration Day and Out on the Tiles. Friends is an interesting acoustic number that is a bit mysterious. Since I've Been Loving You is an awesome lengthy blues song. Gallows Pole is straight up folk, but hard enough to be zeppelin. Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp is a fun, acoustic folky, well.. stomp. Tangerine and That's the Way have to be too of the most beautiful songs in the Led Zeppelin catalogue, and probably a couple of the most beautiful i've ever heard. Tangerine reminds me a bit of the Rolling Stones song Wild Horses that would come out a year later. when i hear That's the Way, i feel as though i'm in another world. a slightly psychadelic aura to that song. the closing Hats off to Roy Harper, is a retitled, bizzarly arranged traditional blus number. Page's guitar coming out of one speaker while Plant's distorted voice is coming out of the other. on the first initial listen to this song you may think &quot;What the f**k is this?&quot; but in this album, it works.
B00003CXFG|3.0|Director:  David Twohy<BR>Cast:  Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David, Claudia Black.<BR>Running Time:  107 minutes.<BR>Rated R for violence and language.<br />Obviously, \\"Pitch Black\\" is a major rip-off of \\"Alien\\" or any other monster/alien/ghost film ever made.  With that criticism set aside, this film, directed by David Twohy, is highly entertaining and devilishly dark at the same time.  The film revolves around a group of space vessel inhabitants who stumble upon an unknown planet that has three suns.  The amount of suns; however, is not the most unusual spectacle on the planet, for they are stalked by ravenous flying creatures that thrive on darkness.<br />With the help from Vin Diesel as the creepy, blinded warrior,  Riddick, the crew must figure out how to not only survive on this horrific planet, but somehow leave before a solar eclipse wipes out all light from the planet and allows the flesh-eating monsters to have more exposure.  Excellent special effects and some interesting cinematography, but this action-packed science-fiction romp is hampered by sub-par acting peformances and a mediocre script.  Certainly not the worst of its kind, but because they are so many of its kind, \\"Pitch Black\\" seems overdone, less original, and only moderately satisfying.  The Unrated Version has a few minutes of extra footage that are very entertaining and add to the only mediocre story.  It is a fine addition to the film and it would have been beneficial to have it in the theatrical release.
B00005B4GU|3.0|er i'm sorry but this album isn't without flaws i mean like pulk/pull revolving doors sucks big time anyways there are some great songs on it, but for a radiohead album; even Pablo Honey is better!
0767830555|4.0|Director:  Martin Scorsese<BR>Cast:  Robert DeNiro, Harvey Keitel, Cybill Shepherd, Jodie Foster, Peter Boyle.<BR>Running Time:  120 minutes.<BR>Rated R for a scene of extreme violence and language.<br />All of us have known, in some shape or form, how Travis Bickle (played brilliantly by Robert DeNiro) feels.  There is a time in every person's life in which he/she feels isolated from the world, perhaps out of place or unjustly a receiver of misfortune.  Travis, on the other hand, is consumed by this sense of loneliness and despair, taking it to the brink of pure destruction and maniacal proportions.<br />DeNiro is hauntingly right on as the former Vietnam veteran who decides to get a job as a taxi driver for the streets of New York City.  As he cruises the big-city landscape, he realizes all of the hidious crime, starvation, murder, death, and macabre that consumes society.  When he is rejected by a love interest (Shepherd) due to his out-of-the-norm behavior, Travis begins a downward spiral:  he begins to train as if he were still in the military, buys numerous firearms and weapons, and ultimately plans to stage an assasination attempt on one of the political candidates planning to take over the city.<br />When Travis meets a twelve-year old prostitute (Jodie Foster, in a extremely profound and witty introductory performance), his motivations for violence and release are geared towards the awful individuals who have taken this poor girl into their possession and are encouraging her into a filthy profession.  This hatred for filth causes Travis to explode, creating a tormenting, horrific climax that will be remembered as one of the most severe in film history.  &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; is certainly an acquired taste and not a film for all adults.  It is a strikingly honest tale of how the inner troubles of a man can be extremely exaggerated, to the point that he knows no boundaries.<br />Director Scorsese uses dark camera angles and vivid images to portray his story, incorporating a musical score that embodies the essence of the film: an unoffensive saxaphone that dwindles into a deep, resounding boom.  A film that can shock and chill, one that should be celebrated for its original genius, but also a work that is almost too graphic and emotionally-draining to enjoy.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I haven't seen the Broadway show, so I can't say much about it.  I bought the CD because I am a big fan of the Gregory Maguire novel, and was intrigued by the very idea that a musical had been derived from it.  I'm glad I did; the CD is excellent, with more than a few standout numbers, including \\"No One Mourns the Wicked,\\" \\"Dancing Through Life,\\" \\"Popular,\\" \\"Defying Gravity,\\" and \\"Wonderful.\\"  <br />The two leads, Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth (playing the Wicked Witch Elphaba and Galinda the Good Witch), have beautiful singing voices, and also do a fantastic job of adding to the characterizations through their performances (for a good example of this, listen to the song \\"What Is This Feeling?\\", which is another of those standout numbers I mentioned a second ago).  Also excellent, not that this is a surprise, is Joel Grey, who plays the Wizard with tremendous charm and an undercurrent of dangerous mania.  The orchestra turns in a beautiful performance on this recording, as well.<br />If you happen to be unfamiliar with the story of \\"Wicked,\\" it's a take-off on \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" in which we learn the origins and background of the Wicked Witch of the West.  It turns out she had a name, Elphaba, and that she didn't begin life as a villain.  In fact, it seems to be debatable as to whether she was ever a villain, or simply a victim of a fascist government and a gullible girl from Kansas.<br />I highly recommend this CD.  Hopefully, someone will issue a DVD of the show so I can see it!
0792833201|5.0|Director:  Tobe Hooper<BR>Cast:  Craig T. Nelson, Jobeth Williams, Beatrice Straight, Dominique Dunne, Zelda Rubenstein.<BR>Running Time:  114 minutes.<BR>Rated PG for ghastly scary scenes and some language.<br />The anticipation for &quot;Poltergiest&quot; was imminent.  With &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; director Tobe Hooper teaming with the likes of Steven Spielberg (who has directed such classics as &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;) and Frank Marshall, it was bound to be a supernatural classic.  The team did not disappoint.  This film is one of the most stylish, devilishly entertaining horror films of the past quarter century, using superb special effects, fine performances, and an elegantly humorous screenplay as a springboard to portray the terror of restless spirits.<br />The opening scene of &quot;Poltergiest&quot; is the most famous, presenting the cute six-year old girl Carol Ann in front of a disoriented television screen.  As the girl turns back to her family, who has fallen asleep watching a television program, she proclaims &quot;They're here!&quot;, creating the foundation for a tense, roller-coaster ride full of ghoulish thrills and chills.  When the family realizes that their house has been inhabited by fiendish spirits who wish to use their daughter as tool to reach the next world, parents Steven and Diane (played extremely well by &quot;Coach&quot;'s Craig T. Nelson and the charming Jobeth Williams) must put their faith back in love and use sheer determination to save their family from the evil ghosts.<br />Some of the most memorable and witty scenes involve the quirky haunted house specialist (played by Rubenstein), which she guides the Freeling parents into a world of unspeakable horrors as they attempt to rescue their daughter.  The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is evocatively on the mark, using a chorus of children vocalists that not only create a glorious harmony, but add an eeriness to the film.  &quot;Poltergiest&quot; is not only a ghost tale, but a film that renders a theme of hope and faith, using a gentle touch that is not found in many horror films.  A magnificent spectacle of stricly original terror, &quot;Poltergiest&quot; has withstood the tests of time and is still of one of the best.
B0000BXGCN|4.0|To be honest this is the first Lara Fabian's album I'm buying. She used to fall in the annoying 'screaming from the top of my lungs' trap in her first recordings. Her latest studio album &quot;Nue&quot; was already showing a step towards more sober interpretations. This live recording is a definitive proof she has matured. She does not feel the need to prove she can sing loud anymore, which permits her to use her (incredible!) technique at the best. <br />I first heard the guitar/voice delicate new version of &quot;Bambina&quot; on the radio and could not believe it was Lara.  The tenderness and melancholy of the lyrics, dedicated to her granmother, are only enlighten by the new arrangements. The entire album follows the same path.<BR> <BR>Lara brings new versions (supported by piano, acoustic guitar and strings) of her big hits: &quot;J'y crois encore&quot;, &quot;S'en aller&quot;, &quot;Je t'aime&quot;, &quot;Tout&quot;, and &quot;Immortelle&quot;. Her beautiful duet with Maurane &quot;Tu es mon autre&quot; is also included. &quot;Si tu m'aimes&quot; and &quot;Parce que tu pars&quot; are presented in a medley. <br />She throws in a couple of covers. French classic hits: Aznavour &quot;Comme ils disent&quot;, Brel &quot;Voir un ami pleurer&quot;, Renaud &quot;Mistral gagnant&quot;; the famous &quot;Caruso&quot;, Bagdad Café soundtrack &quot;Calling you&quot; and the wonderful medley of &quot;Starmania&quot; musical classics (Le monde est stone, la serveuse automate, les uns contre les autres).<br />She even sing an aria from La Traviata (&quot;Addio del passato&quot;).<BR> <BR>Lara proves here she is in full control of her art. She can sing as an opera diva, control her powerful vocals to smooth even the most irritating power ballads: what a difference between the screamed out original version of &quot;Je t'aime&quot; and it's much classier version here... She can play with her voice, permits herself humour. Without losing her powerful presence, Lara Fabian is gaining maturity and wisdom. Emotions are here much more important than performance. I hope she'll remember the lesson for her next studio recording.
B00003Q438|4.0|Director:  James Cameron<BR>Cast:  Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Michael Biehn.<BR>Running Time:  171 minutes.<BR>Rated PG-13 for violence and language.<br />Amidst the year of the \\"deep sea adventure\\", this James Cameron science-fiction epic is much better than the other films of the similar genre released in the same year (\\"Leviathan\\" and \\"Deep Star Six\\", respectively).  While stationed underwater as a standard oil rig crew doing their jobs and anticipating coming home to their families, their captain (Ed Harris) has been recruited and instructed to embark on an intense search-and-rescue mission when a nuclear submarine mysteriously sinks.<br />When attempting to make this rescue, Harris and his team are thrust with the aggressive and disagreeable Mastrantonio, who happens to be Harris's ex-wife in the film.  As the two ex-lovers butt heads and ideologies, they soon realize that they have much bigger problems to deal with as a supernatural, alien-like presence confronts their craft.  As they locate the nuclear bomb, the rig captain finds himself on a spectacular odyssey thousands of feet below the ocean's surface, where he must contend with a force that has power to change or destory the world.<br />One of the first films to use computer-generated special effects, \\"The Abyss\\" is a superb tale with many sincere, powerful messages sprinkled throughout.  Top-notch performances from both Harris and Mastrantonio, as well as Michael Biehn as a sneaky, neurotic crew member that plans to sabvotage their rescue efforts.  Emotional, witty, and profound.  Certainly not as mainstream as some of Cameron's other films (\\"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\\" and \\"Titanic\\"), but well worth the near 3-hour viewing length.
0783225849|5.0|This is not only the best Hitchcock film of them all but it is also the greatest scary movie of them all.  This film sparked every horror villain that ever graced the silver screen.  Mike Meyers, Scream, Freddy Cruegar, and Jason Voorhees would never have seen the spotlight had it not been for Norman Bates.  This film is very suspensful and takes you by surprise when you first watch the film.  It breaks every cliche that you would expect in a slasher flick.  See it and be terrified.  I highly reccomend it.
6305558167|5.0|At times the acting pushes the envelope a bit, especially Nigel Terry in the title role.  But Helen Mirren defines erotic evil as Morganna, while Cherie Lunghi is equally appealing as the fair wife of Arthur.<br />Forget the Disney-fied versions elsewhere, this is a telling of the Arthurian legend that is faithful to the ages.  The cinematography is first rate, and the musical score with selections from Carl Orff's Carmena Burana is perfect!<br />Given that this version is 20 years old now, it's a blast to see familiar faces in lesser roles... particularly Patrick Stewart in his pre-Captain Picard days.<br />The nudity and violence might bother some, but they are well within context.  This is a wonderful, wonderful movie!
6305313687|4.0|The most disturbing thing about this film is that the hate and racism are more believable than the sudden ascent from them. Edward Norton's eloquent, passionate portrayal of a skinhead seemed more real than his quieter, more introspective portrayal of an ex-skinhead. He had been driven into the Neo-Nazi underworld by a lack of identity and an undirected rage at society; it gave him an identity, and an outlet for his anger. In prison, however, his character is suddenly transformed from an angry, passionate skinhead into a quiet, sensitive guy. The racism goes away, but the root causes of it are never resolved, and it leaves the rest of the movie with an unnatural, saccharine taste to it. The causes, motivations, and defenses for the characters' white supremacy are there, but there seems to be no reason for the sudden change. It is arguably because Edward Norton's performance as a skinhead was so strong, but his performance afterward seemed empty. Tony Kaye must take much of the blame in this for not providing any motivation for the transformation.<BR>I believed Edward Furlong: he acted consistently throughout as a hero-worshipping younger brother would. His behaviour hinged so much on Norton's, however, that Norton's unbeleivable character turnaround pulled Furlong's solidly grounded and well played character from the believability and realism the acting merited.<br />All in all, a brilliant, disturbing, thought-provoking film; the brilliant performances in the first half of the movie overshadow the salvation in the second half, so you are left more with a chilling view of Neo-Nazism than with an inspiring story of their salvation from hateful views.
B00008EY65|4.0|This movie was highly entertaining though a little hard to follow.  Not being familiar with the comics, may have been the reason for my difficulties in following the plot.<br />Hellboy is found during a raid on a Nazi operation near the end of the war.  The Nazi's, with the aid of Rasputin (yes, The Rasputin from Russia)  are trying to rig a contraption and open up a rift in a type of Hell and loose demons on Earth.  The plot is foiled but the soldiers discover Hellboy.  He is brought back and raised in secret by a kind of CIA organization.<br />Years later Rasputin is back with the aid of a zombie swordsman and a reptilian creature that has numerous lives.  Rasputin's plan is to use Hellboy to continue the attempt at opening up the rift in the universe to Hell.  Great action ensues.<br />Ron Perlman actually does a convincing job as Hellboy and look for John Hurt as Hellboy's mentor.

B00003CWRX|5.0|Director:  Michael Mann<BR>Cast:  Al Pacino, Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer, Diane Venora, Philip Baker Hall, Lindsay Crouse, Debi Mazar.<BR>Running Time:  158 minutes.<BR>Rated R for language and some violence.<br />Loosely based on a similar real-life tobacco industry media predicament, &quot;The Insider&quot; is an honest, taut portrayal of how one man's willingness to comply with the media and speak his mind can change more things than he could ever imagine.  Al Pacino gives his best performance outside of &quot;The Godfather II&quot; and &quot;Scarface&quot;, depicting the veteran &quot;60 Minutes&quot; television show producer Lowell Bergman, who is on a hot trail of a story involving the corrupt tobacco industries.  Russell Crowe, fresh off fine performances in &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; and &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot;, plays an insider source for Bergman after he loses his job as a prominent tobacco company excecutive.<br />When these two men join forces in a battle against the cigarette production and distribution company, Jeffery Wigand (Crowe) has his world turned outside down with death threats and media coverage.  Believing that Bergman has set up him to fall, he later realizes that both not only want to save their reputations, but they are striving for the same goal--to communicate the truth.  Pacino is in rare, spectacular form, while Crowe is more than adequate as the counterpart.  Supporting the lead stars is Plummer as the incomporable Mike Wallace, portraying the strong television icon to near perfection.<br />Although over two-and-a-half hours, &quot;The Insider&quot; moves at a quick pace and keeps the audience guessing both Wigand and Bergman's next moves.  Michael Mann shoots and cuts a brilliant, beautiful piece of visual artistry, solidifying himself as one of the top directors heading into the next century.  A masterpiece of intellect and honor, setting itself a part from many other media-dramas of its kind.  Exhilerating and captivating.

B0001CCY7E|5.0|This is one of John Barry's masterworks - if not indeed his magnus opus - and we've waited much too long for a comprehensive reissue. Whatever you think of Kevin Costner's film (and I'd hate to base a friendship on whether or not someone loved &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; as I did) it would be a far less exciting movie without Barry's magnificent score. Eschewing the more traditional Western sound pioneered by Jerome Moross and Elmer Bernstein, which eventually descended into rank imitation and self-parody, Barry went for a lush, poewerful symphonic rhapsody. While avoiding ethnic cliches in his music for the Native American characters, he found expression for the more violent aspects of tribal warfare through a stunning, resonant, absolutely plangent use of percussion that quickens the pulse and suggests menace without going into histrionic overdrive. Barry's melodic work is no less impressive: in his justly famous &quot;John Dunbar Theme,&quot; for example, there is a weird, majestic inevitability to the notes - they seem to flow into one another in exactly the right way; you can't imagine a single cadence being any different. This new release restores much that was truncated on the original release of the score. &quot;The Buffalo Hunt&quot; - which accompanies one of the most original and exciting set-pieces in recent American movies - is given the full treatment here, and is therefore twice as satisfying. My only cavil: Barry wrote an hour and 40 minutes worth of music, so even this lovingly restored version is shorter than it might be in a perfect world. And I'm not sure why the producers added the film version of the Dunbar theme as a bonus track rather than reordering it to replace the album version within the score itself. Still, this disc is a major cause for celebration, an essential element for the shelves of any true lover of film music.
B00005JMEW|4.0|I wanted to like this movie very badly.  I had heard the good reviews and I like Tarantino's other works, so I figured this had to be a winner.  Maybe my expectations were a little too high because, while I liked it, I was a little disappointed. <br />Hollywood loves to congratulate itself at any opportunity. As if the 300 awards shows scheduled each year aren't enough, it has to crank out movies like this.  I file movies like this under the sub-category \\"Hollywood F*llating Itself\\".  This movie was like a series of \\"in jokes\\" that nobody except critics, Tarantino, and a few other would truly appreciate.  <br />So I wonder if there really is anything lurking below the surface.  This is just a shell of a movie-it's a very pretty shell, but still just a shell.  It is almost like the critics decided that this was a good movie b/c of the in jokes, and everybody who saw this movie says they like it because they are afraid of being left out.  Movies like this come out every once in a while (`Eyes Wide Shut' being a good example).<br />So what you are left with is a movie that is visually entertaining but regrettably forgettable.  Don't get me wrong, the violence, language, and dark nature didn't bother me at all.  I liked the movie-I gave it four stars.  And I loved the editing, the `look', the style, and the delivery.  I just thought the whole thing was a little empty. This film could have been legendary if the story and plot had been as immersing as it was visually stunning.  Because the plot and story were so lame, I feel like this is only a part of a film (Kill Bill 2 was a little better). This is not the type of movie that I could watch over and over again.  Kill Bill 1 is like cinematic cotton candy:  every once in a while is okay, but making a diet out of it is unhealthy.
B00006IUL7|4.0|Director:  Christopher Nolan.<BR>Cast:  Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hillary Swank, Maura Tierney, Martin Donovan, Nicky Katt.<BR>Running Time:  118 minutes.<BR>Rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity.<br />As if Hitchcock woke from the dead and decided to make one last film so his soul could finally rest, he would have made a film very similar to &quot;Insomnia&quot;.  Although Christopher Nolan is certainly no Hitchcock, this intense suspense-thriller possesses the some of the qualities that make a true classic.  The story winds through the nightless town of Nightmute, Alaska, where LAPD detective Will Dormer (played by Al Pacino is an only par performance) investigates a troubling serial killer case.  When the investigation takes a sudden, twisting turn, Dormer not only is in pursuit of a killer, but is up against the sleepless psychological trauma that is disrupting his every move.<br />As Dormer gets closer and closer to the truth, he comes across a startlingly eerie author (Robin Williams), who happens to have vital information about concerning one of the victim's death.  As Dormer becomes more involved with the author, his paranoia grows increasingly unstable.  Williams steals the show throughout the second half of the film, portraying the role with ease; a haunting character that must have crept mightily out of his soul.  Hillary Swank is a some-what misused rookie officer who is one step behind Dormer in solving the case and her peformance is only fair.<br />Director Nolan uses the excellent Hilary Seitz to his advantage, plotting Dormer's fears and ambitions, tooling Pacino and Williams's characters in a battle of good and evil, yet the good and the evil are presented in an enigmatic, vague fashion that will keep viewers guessing.  Entertaining, thrilling, and moderately scary--Hitchcock would have been pretty proud.
0783240503|4.0|Donny Osmond, it would seem, was born to play this part.  Both vocally and in the acting department, he raises the bar for every other Joseph out there. He captures the character's naivete and simultaneous intelligence pitch-perfect, his dazzling smile embodies the character's undying optimism, and his lovely clear tenor is perfectly suited to the singing role.  I personally did like the Narrator quite a lot. She's quite funny, and her voice is very pretty. It's true that she's not belting the high notes very strongly - her vocal stylisms are more operatic than the average Broadway soprano, but I think it makes her interpretation unique and adds a quiet intensity that is normally not found in the role.  <br />There are some flaws.  For example, I found the Mrs. Potiphar scene unnecessarily graphic.  Though Ms. Collins looks gorgeous for her age, and acts the part with irascible charm, her costume is largely a flesh-colored leotard with a few strategic bunches of purple sequins. It looks as though she's nude and wearing pasties.  The entire instrumental sequence of that scene, which in the stage version is usually just an over-the-top \\"seduction\\" scene, is replaced here with a simulated orgy.  I always cover my 6yo's eyes during that part. ;)  I also agree with the other reviewers who said that the Baker and the Butler were really lifeless and sang terribly, and Jacob was expressionless throughout.  His version of \\"distraught grief\\" was to stand there slightly slack jawed. Really pretty boring.<br />But these will not deter anyone from thoroughly enjoying this video again and again, and there are many aspects of the production that will forever set the standard.  The eleven brothers were priceless, and all had very good chemistry with each other, the Narrator and Joseph.  They also all clearly had incredible voices.  The costumes were spectacular and colorful, the musical arrangement is the best I've ever heard in this show, and the pacing is compelling and consistent.  The Pharaoh slays me every time - his comedic timing and appropriately overdramatic expressions coupled with his gorgeous baritone are just sublime perfection for the role. And Donny will make you grin right back at him. <br />In short, it's a very, very strong production that surpasses every stage version I've ever seen, and it is extremely faithful to the spirit of Webber's vision.

0790729652|4.0|Director:  Tim Burton<br />Cast:  Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Kim Basinger, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, Jack Palance.<br />Running Time:  130 minutes.<br />Rated PG-13 for violence and language.<br />Based on the long-time DC comics hero and 1960s television series, &quot;Batman&quot; is a screen triumph with plenty of action, fine performances, and an upbeat soundtrack.  Michael Keaton stars as the extremely wealthy Bruce Wayne, who is secretly Gotham City's caped crusader who beats up all the bad guys and saves the day.  When The Joker (played marvelously by the one-and-only Nicholson) attempts to take over the city using his demonic ways, Batman is forced to take action against this most unusual of villians.<br />While &quot;Batman&quot; is a standard super-hero action flick, director Tim Burton's dark portrayal of the Dark Knight is right on, shadowing Keaton and drawing a much more personalized characterization in the lead.  The incorporation of Basinger as the love interest does not complicate the plot, for it only enhances our understanding of Wayne and the personal troubles that accompanies the job of saving a city time after time.  Much more melodramatic than expected, &quot;Batman&quot; is a deep, devilish of a good time that embodies a true good versus evil theme.  One of the better of its kind.
6302787297|5.0|Ridley Scott, best known for such films as Gladiator and Black Hawk Down, is well-known for creating movies that are visually stunning.  A trained graphic artist, Scott has an understanding of composition, color, and lighting that few other directors come close to mastering.  What Spielberg does for pacing and narration of stories that can be followed by all, Scott does for visual magic.  And 1492 is arguably Scott's best work.<br />Unfortunately, this movie did not receive the popular nor critical attention that it so rightly deserved.  There are many possible reasons for this: at the time it was introduced (1992) there was another Columbus film that was really bad.  I'm sure many of the negative reviews of that film didn't help ticket sales for this one.  Secondly, the political correctness of the time had cast Columbus into an unfortunately negative image.  The Columbus in this movie is neither the hero nor the villian extremists wish to make him out to be, so the film does tend to alienate both extremes in its attempt to portray Columbus as that one kind of historical figure many people seem to have a problem with: a human being.<br />The film itself does have its flaws.  The script is a little awkward, as is the pacing.  But on the visual and technical side, this is a film that powerfully transports the viewer to that time.  Every scene seems obsessed over.  The costumes, the position of the sun, the light, even the food.  You can feel the cold, the heat, the dust.<br />Even the music is wonderful.  Most of it is electronic based, composed by Vangelis who is best known for his theme to the movie Chariots of Fire.  Some have complained this is a bad mismatch, as electronic music wasn't around in Columbus' era.  However, neither were contemporary orchestras that drive the scores to many historical movies.  While at first unusual the soundtrack for this movie is a perfect fit, serving to powerfully infuse Scott's brilliant visual composition with just the right emotional vibration.<br />Gerard Depardieu would not have been my first choice for this role, but his performance is certainly very impressive.  While it's not the Columbus I was expecting, it is a wonderfully human performance.  Many have griped about Depardieu's accent, claiming he's difficult to understand and feeling it's not sufficiently Italian.  However, keep in mind that Columbus was from Genoa (and remember where that is).  As all of the Spanish characters are speaking English in this film, Depardieu's French accent stands out from everyone else in the same way that Columbus' accent most likely stood out from his Spanish companions 500 years ago.  What some people seem rather bothered by I actually found rather fitting.<br />So what do we have here?  A movie that's visually stunning and a technical masterpiece, but a little awkward in the script.  If you've been impressed by the visual aspects of other Ridley Scott films, notably Legend, Blade Runner, and Black Hawk Down, be sure to see this.  Put aside your prejudices, forget historical authenticity, and simply enjoy one of the most visually impressive films available.<br />(I was originally going to give this movie 4 stars in recognition that it does have some flaws.  However, the visual qualities of the film so make up for the shortcomings that I had to move it up to 5.)
B000001IQH|2.0|... with guitars!  Or not, as the case may be.  I know it's been said many times before, but it bears repeating: those who were around when the blueprint was established by The Clash have heard this before, only done so much better by Strummer, Jones &amp; co.<br />The Clash had legendary NYC poet Allen Ginsberg guest on a song (1982's &quot;Ghetto Defendant&quot;) performing spoken word?  No problem: Rancid will get legendary NYC poet Jim Carroll to guest on a song performing spoken word.  Etc.<br />The only surprise is that Rancid didn't call their next album &quot;Zapatista!&quot; and make a triple CD out of it.<br />Seriously, go and buy &quot;The Clash&quot;, &quot;Give 'em Enough Rope&quot;, &quot;London Calling&quot;, &quot;Black Market Clash&quot;, &quot;Sandinista!&quot; and &quot;Combat Rock&quot; instead.
068484267X|5.0|Maybe a key factor to this book hitting me square between the eyes like it did, was the fact that this is a real person's memoirs.<br />It's just another, &quot;No matter had bad you think you have it...&quot; book (which even the author realizes, as he notes a couple of his schoolmates who had it worse than him).  However, it was more powerfully conveyed than by any other means I've ever read.<br />Truly brilliant.

6304779356|3.0|I'm so sick of people naming this as &quot;the coolest vampire movie of all time&quot;.  Please, this is teeny bopper horror at it's best.  While there is ample gore, and a great performance by Kiefer Sutherland, the movie still wasn't enough to keep me throughly interested.  I found myself laughing for most of the time, especially by two things: The intentional comic reliefs, aka grampa and the Corey's.  Grampa is a riot, but the Corey's are such bad actors that you laugh at them every time they open their mouth (&quot;my own brother, a bloodsucker!&quot;).  Another thing is the many homoerotic undertones.  Check out that Rob Lowe poster on Corey Haim's closet.  That silly Joel Schuemaker!   <BR>Oh well.  It's entertaining, but not something I'd care to watch often.
B00008EY9G|4.0|IDENTITY didn't make great waves at the Australian box office, and I am surprised by that. I finally saw it on DVD recently and was very impressed by it, and consider it one of the best films of 2003.<br />10 characters end up at a Bates-like Motel, with seemingly nothing in common.  When people start dying, it becomes a case of who-dunnit. To tell anymore would give it away, but let me say it is one of the most original twist endings I have seen in a long time.<br />John Cusack is excellent, as is Ray Liota.  Rebecca Mornay makes a comeback in this film, if only for 10 minutes.  You will not recognise her at first with her brunette hair.<br />Ignore the negative reviews, Identity is a clever and imaginative film which blew me away! I had the DVD in my possession for awhile choosing not to watch it because of its poor performance at the box office.  Howeverm, that was my loss, because the film was excellent.
B00008CLOA|5.0|i have to add something to the review by diablometallica. this album celebrates its 30th anniversary this year, having been produced in 1974. Floyd however has been around since 1967. thats 37 years now that the Masters of psychedelics have been thrilling the world with haunting melodies and brilliant lyrics. miss spears (or whatever her name is now, maybe she took back her maiden name?) now has a really long time to stay around in circulation to catch up. Floyd hasnt released an album since 1994, sure, but the members have been busy. David Gilmour has been doing alot of charity work, as well as selling his multimillion dollar mansions and donating the proceeds to the homeless. miss spears wont even let people download her SONGS for free. to the escaped mental patient braying his/her devotion to conventional courtesans: find something else to do with your time. Floyd will live forever, and F.U. if you dont understand it.

B000002L7R|5.0|Around The World In A Day is one of prince's most over looked albums of his carear. But Around The World In The Day is also one of Prince's all time best albums. This Dirty Mind, Purple Rain, and 1999 make up Prince's all time best albums. This came out right after Purple Rain, his biggest album, and his classic. the heat had not yet died down from the movie or the album so this is to Prince what Ghoats Head Soup was to The Rolling Stones. It was classic and original but to soon.<br />Around The World In A Day is unlike any other Prince album, it has crazy sound production and over all musical acomplishment. This is a truly original album. The album opens with the strange Beatles-esqe title track. Its crazy, and cool at the same time. Then the album jumps into 'Paisly Park' a song about utopia, and it sounds like a carnival to me and its one of the very best songs that Prince ever recorded, no joke the song is that good its got to be in his top five of all time! 'Condition Of The Heart' is next, its a great space age synthed out ballad as only Prince could do. 'Raspberry Barret' is next, you have heard it thousands of time as it is the biggest hit off the album. 'Raspberry Barret' is the first Prince song I ever heard and is one of my all time favorites. Next is 'Tamborine' a high speed, high powerd funk song with a heavy bass line and a killer production once again. 'America' is Prince's very own little national anthm and its a really cool track one of the best off the album. 'Pop Life' the second hit single off the album has killer production and bass line, its about the music biz and the drugs and pressure everyone feels especially him because at the time he was the biggest atrist in the world. 'The Ladder' and Temptation' are two very cool songs and are perfect for ending Around The World In A Day.<br />Around The World In A Day as you see is one of the most original and most creattive albums that Prince ever made, you need this or your music collection can never be complete!r be complete!

Stand out tracks include: Git up, loyalty, 6 in the morning, get my gun, american psycho, b!$*h, 40 oz., good die young, and keep talkin. Good production, creative, funny and sometimes insightful lyrics (good die young). Also contains a freestyle by Bugz, a deceased member of D12, and a new artist on shady records. One of the better rap albums released this year. Don't buy this album if you have no sense of humor or get offended easily.
0192833383|5.0|THE MOONSTONE was the first mystery story, and it in many ways remains one of the most remarkable.  Working in the shadow of the Gothic and Romantic literary traditions, Wilkie Collins managed to create something new and unique.  Instead of the endless evocation of atmosphere and focusing on sinister villains, Collins focuses instead on a simple mystery and its solution:  who stole the diamond known as the Moonstone, and where did it go?  But any reader of the novel knows that the mystery is secondary to the exposition and the marvelous parade of characters.  It isn't the getting to the resolution of the mystery that is the main thing, but the process of getting there.<br />One of the great attractions of the novel is the extraordinary style of the writing.  Although the first English mystery story, it had not yet devolved into a genre, and Collins was not aware that a mystery story could not also be great literature.  As a result, he imbued his characters with enormous charm and give them each a vivid manner in expressing themselves.  The multiple narratives by this remarkable characters was a strategy to deal with the problem of authorial point of view.  On the one hand, Collins wanted to avoid the omniscient narrator who would know the truth both about each character and about the myster of the fate of the diamond.  Collins therefore cast the novel in the form of a succession of narratives by the various participants in the novel.  He thereby limits the knowledge of each narrator, but he also is able thereby to provide considerable variation in the style of each narrative.  The two most remarkable segments are those by Gabriel Betteridge, House-Steward in the service of Lady Verinder and her cousin Miss Clack, a prim and fervid evangelical Christian whose missionary zeal and prudish moralizing provide many of the funniest moments of the novel.  The style of these two could not be more distinct, both from the rest of the narratives and from each other.  Miss Clack has constantly to fight a tendency to sermonize.  She is apt to turn out passages such as:  &quot;A thundering knock at the street door startled us all.  I looked through the window, and saw the World the Flesh, and the Devil waiting before the house--as typified in a carriage and horses, a powdered footman, and three of the most audaciously dressed women I ever beheld in my life.&quot;  Betteridge, on the other hand, is solid, practical, a tad parochial, but ferociously loyal to his employer.  For him the good life consists of a good pipe and a copy of ROBINSON CRUSOE at hand.  If one laughs a bit at Miss Clack, the reader comes to thoroughly like Betteredge.  Between the two of them, their narrative occupy more than half the novel.  The others are also quite enjoyable, but not to the degree that these two are.<br />THE MOONSTONE is a page turner, which is to say that it is a delight to read.  One wants to read quickly both because each page is such a joy and because one wants to discover what happens next.  The characters are mainly enjoyable, but like so many authors his eccentric characters are far more memorable and enjoyable than his central characters.  Betteredge, Miss Clack, and Sgt. Cuff far outstrip the &quot;hero&quot; of the book, who while a good citizen, is from a literary point of view a tad boring.<br />I can agree with those readers who consider THE WOMAN IN WHITE a better book, but this is another of those comparisons that are odious.  The book is so enjoyable, fun, and memorable that I can't imagine any reader lamenting during the course of its pages that they weren't reading the other book instead.has constantly to fight a tendency to sermonize.

B000002L99|3.0|This album is too pop for my tastes. Van Halen was a heavy metal band, but afterward, they turnes kind of synth pop. No offense to Hagar, but Diamond Dave was a much better singer. Also, some of these lyrics are dumb. For a VH newbie, I would reccomend 1984 or Van Halen II.
B00000DG1R|5.0|I have gotten several copies of \\"Greatest\\" even since it came out in late 1998!  Whenever they have a sale on older Capitol Records CDs, I always get it!  Duran Duran made such superb pop songs. Their hooks and musical landscapes helped defined the sounds of the '80s with the new wave sounds of the first half.  South Carolina is where their songs sound the best--radio stations played their songs more during summer 1984, especially \\"The Reflex\\", \\"Hungry Like The Wolf\\" and others.  I have played \\"Save A Prayer\\" countless times on this CD, \\"Ordinary World\\" merges their classic '80s sound and 1993 all into one song.  I voted that for best song in the '93 Rolling Stone Readers' Poll. Nile Rodgers gave DD their best work, perhaps his best post-Chic period of hits! Two songs, \\"All She Wants Is\\" (1988) and \\"Electric Barbarella\\" (1997)sound identical, more like brothers, but dynamic danceable songs! The '86 song, \\"Notorious\\" still sounds dynamite. Their glamorous look and their fashions in their videos blended well with the music that they performed. The songs blend so beautifully for 78 minutes! Although I didn't get into them until 1983, the two early songs from 80-81, \\"Girls on Film\\" and \\"Planet Earth\\" were also good. \\"Serious\\" from 1990 doesn't grab me like the others, but it's okay. With their having a new album in 2004 or 2005, this feel full circle to hear their past hits on this album.  I hope the new album will be just as much a classic as the '80s hits they have enjoyed in their music career.  To Simon, the Taylors, Nick and other members past and present, thank you for the phenomenal music on this album!!!!
B0001IN0DA|4.0|A very mediocre wrestlemania. I can only think of a few great matches on this card. Here is a list of the matches in order.<br />1. John Cena vs. The Big Show<BR>Good way to start off wrestlemania. Good rap by Cena but should have been in a midcard slot. 7.5/10<br />2.Fatal 4 way for world tag team titles<BR>A good match but all 8 men could have put a better effort.6/10<br />3.Chris jericho vs. Christian<BR>Good match, had very good high spots in the match. Christian and Jericho were very consistent. Trish also turning heel was good.8/10<br />4.Handicap match: Evolution vs the rock & sock connection<BR>Electrifying. The Rock is one of the best on the mic and in the ring. Mick Foley is amazing. Ric Flair did a good job and Batista and Randy Orton are becoming more and more impressive.<BR>9/10<br />5. Playboy evening gown match<BR>A good filler of time. It gives the men what they want,so i give this a 10/10.<br />6.cruiser weight open<BR>Good high spots, but to short. Probably giving time for the undeserving Lesnar, Goldberg match.8/10<br />7. Brock vs. Goldberg w/stone cold as special referree<BR>Worst match, the reason the ppv went down hill. I love both Goldberg and Lesnar but I expected both of them to fight,not just some staredown and their finishing moves. austin saved them. 2/10<br />8. Fatal 4 way for the wwe tag titles<BR>Ok match i thought the raw tag would be better but the SD! titles was much better.7/10<br />9. Victoria vs. Molly holly <BR>Just skip.2/10<br />10. Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt angle wwe championship<BR>great match. Guerrero is a great champion and Angle is amazing. These two put on a hell of contest, and both deserve to be champion.10/10<br />11.undertaker vs. kane<BR>OK match, Taker is better as the american badass cause of his age and skill. Kane hasnt looked better in a long time.very good opener but short match. 7/10<br />12. triple threat: Triple h vs.HBK vs.Chris Benoit<BR>An amazing contest, I have great respect for all three of these men, but I think the right man came out on top. 10/10<br />Overall a great ppv, but not the best wrestlemania. Brock goldberg match brought the whole crowd down. Probably should have came on before the triple threat.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This is one of her best albums, second to \\"Oops I Did It Again.\\"  It sounds sexy, sensual, catchy, and very erotic. I like \\"Toxic\\", \\"Outrageous\\", \\"Early Morning,\\", \\"Me Against The Music\\", \\"Shadow\\", \\"Touch of My Hand\\", \\"Boom Boom\\", and \\"Showdown.\\"  Britney's shift to newer producers, musicians and songwriters are what make this album unique.  While I miss Max Martin's familiar presence, this is the direction Britney Spears needs to move now.  A lot of people say this is controversial, but this is Britney's more mature effort now.
1559408855|5.0|First of all, this movie is a great adaptation of Sade's book. In \\" 120 days of sodom\\" the sadist nobles were taking their power by their money. In the movie, the source of the power comes from the political authority in the fascist era of Italy.<BR>It's a powerful expression of disgust for the modern times. And shows us Passolini's infernal vision to the eternal darkness of humanity.<BR>It's hard to watch and stand the torture scenes. But the film itself is not disgusting at all! There is a wonderful esthetic during the movie, even in the torture scenes. (Like the enchanting chorus \\"Veris Leta Facies\\" from Carl Orff's Carmina Burana which was playing during the most terrfying tortures)<br />Probably it's Passolini's masterpiece... And a must see for the cinema specialists...
0871359448|4.0|When the Infinity Gauntlet saga originally happened, I was in my comic collecting prime.  I missed out on most the saga, sadly, because I was in an area where it was quite hard to get a good selection of comics.  I bought a few tie-in issues from other series and sort of pieced together what was going on.  The only thing I remember is knowing the Infinity Gauntlet was coming in advance, because an issue of Quasar (my favorite comic at the time.  Please don't laugh at me about that.) showed Thanos with the Gauntlet, as he attempted (unsuccesfully) to destroy a super-powerful villian you've never heard of called Maelstrom.  (If you care at all, the Quasar series was called Cosmos in Collision and ended with the universe nearly being destroyed.  I really wish they'd reprint that one as well, but Quasar has never been, and likely never will be, popular enough to warrant something like that.)<br />This collection, though, is great.  All of the original issues of Infinity Gauntlet in one.  All the &quot;intergalactic biggies&quot; are there like Uatu (The Watcher), Galactus, Eternity, Death, Living Tribunal and a few more.  (Noticeably absent are Infinity and Oblivion.)<br />I particularly enjoyed the scene where all the galactic biggies ganged up on Thanos and started beating him senseless.  Or they tried to, anyway.<br />As far as I know, this is one of Marvel's earliest multi-comic title sagas.  (Secret Wars came before it, though.  And DC also had done Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1985.)  Whereas Secret Wars was kind of disappointing, Infinity Gauntlet showed how it should be done.  Not bloated and taking well over a year to play out (as CoIE did) and not having a misuse of a good idea (as Secret Wars did), Infinity Gauntlet was nearly as perfect as a concept like this can be.<br />So, now all I'm waiting for is a graphic novel of it's followup story (happening a few years later on), Infinity Crisis.  (Not nearly as good, but gives a certain closure and definitely ends the chance of anymore Infinity storylines.  Well, as definite as you can get in the Marvelverse, anyway.)
0440224764|4.0|It's been a while since I read a John Grisham story. Glad I picked this one up. It read very fast. I am always amazed at Grisham's story-telling abilities. I also think it is a good thing he went into writing and not into criminal activity!<br />I don't think there is a man on earth who has not once dreamed of dropping it all, and getting out of the rat race. Patrick Lanigan did not just dream about it...he put it into action. Given that he was in a situation where he knew he was going to be fired, his wife was fooling around, he was liable to miss out on a money-making scheme his partners were involved in (criminally)...he saw an opportunity to do something about it. Many people would have just gotten depressed.<br />The amount of planning that went into this scheme is phenomenal. Lanigan planned for almost every contingency. He knew he would ultimately get caught, so he prepared for that situation ahead of time. He thought of almost everything, and to say anymore is to give away the plot.<br />So this book is not great writing. It's not the worst I've read, and if the book makes you think, then it's worth the time. (...)<br />Karen Sadler
B0001AP12G|4.0|The debut album of producer/emcee Kanye West is a solid start for a long healthy career.<br />Minus the skits, the songs on the CD are very diverse and have meaningful lyrics. In a radio world where the only major rap artists are 50 Cent and Eminem (and basically everyone signed to Shady Records), Kanye West's sound is different. He raps about true to life things like being in touch with Jesus (&quot;Jesus Walks&quot;), the adoration of party girls (&quot;Slow Jamz w/ Jamie Foxx &amp; Twista) and even the painful occurances of being let down by someone you trust (&quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;).<br />Kanye West has a sense of humor, and he shows it on this CD. He raps about a fictional workout tape he has for women to look and feel better about themselves (&quot;The New Workout Plan&quot;) and a modern day college kid anthem who can't take the stressful life of paying college loans (&quot;We Don't Care&quot;).<br />My personal favorite tracks are &quot;All Falls Down&quot;, &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;, &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;, &quot;Get Em High&quot;, &quot;Breathe In Breathe Out&quot;, &quot;Two Words&quot; and &quot;Through The Wire&quot;.<br />I highly recommend this album even if you're not a rap fan cause, trust me, it doesn't sound like G-G-G-G Unit.

After an absence of six years from the film industry, Tarantino returned bigger than ever when the film thrashed its way into cinemas around the world and broke all records imaginable for a film with a kick-ass female lead. Tarantino's original plan was to make this a 4 hour epic, but decided to split the film into two volumes. There are many advantages of this for him: twice as much money at the box office, two as much money from DVD sales, twice as much hype for the second volume and two stunning soundtracks...<br />Tarantino is well known for his love of popular culture, and his soundtracks to the films he directs are always painfully and methodically planned out to ensure worldwide appeal. It is often said that a soundtrack can make a film, and in the case of Kill Bill, they sure are right! The soundtrack to Volume 1 of Kill Bill is the ultimate and you are left with a feeling that Tarantino surely cannot top it with his soundtrack to Volume 2 by the time it finishes. On this soundtrack we get some of the film's most memorable music all contained on one disc for your listening pleasure. Take the opening track, Nancy Sinatra's \\"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\\" which instantly brings in themes of old Western films. A true classic, revived for this soundtrack. Someone's been listening to too much Elvis on Charlie Feathers' \\"That Certain Female,\\" whilst the instrumental qualities of \\"The Grand Duel - (Parte Prima)\\" by Luis Bacalov make for one of the most visual and atmospheric tracks on offer here.(...)<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />\\"Kill Bill - Volume 1 Original Soundtrack\\" is actually the first soundtrack to a film that I have ever bought. I don't usually pay much attention to the music in a film, because I'm usually too focused on the acting and storyline, but as always, Tarantino is different and supplies his fans with both an amazing, spectacular film and a stunning, musically-enthralling soundtrack that appeals to listeners of all ages, races and groups. This is truly a brilliant soundtrack and I would recommend it to anyone.antino is different and supplies his fans with both an amazing, spectacular film and a stunning, musically-enthralling soundtrack that appeals to listeners of all ages, races and groups.

B000000OAL|3.0|This, of course, was the first album by Queen.  Unlike all of their subsequent albums, this one had no hit songs.  The version of &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; is not the hit version, but rather an earlier instrumental version.  The album is good, but leans a bit too much towards prog rock for my taste.  &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; is the best song here, but there are some other good ones.  As for the bonus tracks, &quot;Mad the Swine&quot; is a previously unreleased song from the same recording sessions.  There is an undated different version of &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;.  And there is a useless remix of &quot;Liar&quot; that hardly sounds different from the normal version.  Queen fans will want to get this CD, along with all their other CDs.
B00006LHUW|5.0|There aren't many musicians who can release a debut album and go on to become of the biggest superstars of the past decade in the space of a year. Norah Jones is clearly an exception to the rule. Her debut album &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; was released in the spring of 2002 and went no where for about a year. Few critics even knew it was on shelves and only a handful of music industry insiders knew her name. This all changed when the hype began to build and in February 2004, Norah Jones picked up a staggering 8 Grammy awards for the album - a record for a female artist. Suddenly Norah was big news and the album gradually ascended to the No.1 spot all over the world; suddenly jazz was cool; suddenly America had a new idol; suddenly, people began to wonder how such a young lady could make such simple music and break all the records and rules...<br /><br />The album has since topped the charts in both the US and UK and just been certified for US sales of 9 million copies. Worldwide sales stand at 18 million and despite this success, Norah has many critics. Some can't believe her international fame and believe her as nothing more than a jazz/country wannabe with hardly anything to show for it. How wrong they are! Norah's voice is amazingly powerful and extremely soulful. She's chilled out and cool and people can listen to her music easily which is why she appeals to a phenomenally vast market. She also happens to be stunning in appearance, and that always helps. Come Away With Me is now a classic in modern music, a landmark of the times and is still going strong selling hundreds of thousands of copies around the world, with no sign of slowing down!<br />The second single to be taken from the album was the self-titled &quot;Come Away With Me.&quot; This song was first used in adverts around the world, particularly in Europe and soon in 2002, by word-of-mouth, the song became know. The voice was famous, but the name wasn't. The Grammys obviously put a face to the name of the song, and here we have yet another classic from Norah! The song opens with a soft and gentle beat that breaks in so gently and quietly and the piano softly creeps in. Norah begins by singing the chorus, &quot;Come away with me in the night. Come away with me and I will write you a song. Come away with me on a bus. Come away with me where they can't tempt us with their lies.&quot; This beauty is accompanied by the piano in the background, before Norah sings, &quot;I want to walk with you on a cloudy day. In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high. So won't you try to come.&quot; This section is my particular favourite of the song because it is so visual and you get an image in your mind of a field in the middle of the country. Sometimes it's nice to just relax and contemplate on life. I'm as much a party boy as the rest of them, but I like to balance that contrast of the high life with chilling out!<br />Norah then sings the second verse, &quot;Come away with me and we'll kiss. On a mountaintop. Come away with me and I'll never stop loving you.&quot; This is then followed by a gorgeous instrumental of bliss. This is the part where you think of the field and the mountaintop. Norah's vocals rise and she sings, &quot;And I want to wake up with the rain falling on a tin roof. While I'm safe there in your arms. So all I ask is for you to come away with me in the night. Come away with me.&quot; The song then ends just as fantastically as it opened.<br />The video to Come Away With Me is really beautiful and once again works very well with the song's laid-back trademark that has become such a staple in the Norah Jones catalogue. We see Norah driving a car very slowly through the desert and the humor at the end is in that she receives a parking ticket for driving either too fast or slow, we're not sure either way! All in all, if you're looking for something beautiful to chill out to look no further than Norah Jones. She's the one who started the jazz trend currently sweeping the world and she does it the best! You don't have to be a middle-aged nerd to like her music. Hey, I'm a 16 year old guy at the centre of a cultural lifestyle in England and I adore her! Buy this, or the album of the same name, now.sweeping the world and she does it the best! You don't have to be a middle-aged nerd to like her music.

B000077VR3|1.0|This movie was so stupid, I turned it off after the first 15 minutes.  I'm half French, and I can say that this movie completely destroys the class and elegance of the real theatre.  And to top it off I can't believe anyone had the brains to nominate it for an Oscar.  (Probably drank Absinth stright up)<br />Anyone who's been to the real Molin Rouge in Paris will see that this is completely off base. There are no fat people in the show, everyone sits at tables and not dance around.  The place has a lot of high standards.<br />It's supposed to be set in 1900, yet they have a lot of modern music like Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana?  Hello, the director and the writer shoud be dragged out in the street and shot!<br />If you are stupid enough to believe that this is what really goes on at the Moulin Rouge I got a nice piece of land on Mars to sell you.  Don't waste your money on this load of crap and go to Paris instead!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|One of the greatest films of the past year has to be Quentin Tarantino's epic &quot;Kill Bill - Volume 1.&quot; Proudly dubbed as 'The 4th Film By Quentin Tarantino,' the film is both a masterpiece is modern day action cinema and also in popular culture associations. By blending many themes and genres, Tarantino creates one of the most exciting and enjoyable films of the past decade. A film that breaks new ground and raises the bar for future action films whilst simultaneously giving birth to an icon in the form of The Bride.<br />In the early 1990's Tarantino reigned supreme as the ultimate director of pop culture smashes. &quot;Reservoir Dogs,&quot; &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; made him the hottest man to work with, and even though he only made three films in the space of this decade, he certainly changed the 90's. I was too young to witness any of these movies being only a youngster at the time, but as 2003 rolled on, I knew I had to see his fourth film. Just something about the trailer made it a must-see. Maybe it was the settings? The dialogue? The costumes? The overpour of blood, contrasted with the yellow of The Bride's jumpsuit? Whatever the reason, I knew this would be a good film...<br />In &quot;Kill Bill - Volume 1,&quot; Uma Thurman stars as The Bride (real name 'unknown') who is on a non-stop, blood-thirsty killing spree of revenge to claim justice on the people who left her for dead four and a half years previously. The Bride was once a loyal member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DIVAS) of which Bill (David Carradine) was the boss. She was previously known as Black Mamba and decided she wanted to leave to start a family and get married. Bill didn't take too kindly to this, and on the day of her wedding, Bill sent four of his top murderers to dispatch of her. They nearly succeeded in their quest, slaughtering all the guests. However, The Bride survived and lay in a coma for four and a half years, until she woke up, and - realising she had lost her child - sets out to exact her revenge on all those who tried to kill her off.<br />This is where the film truly begins, but one must take into account that the film is sliced up into five different sections, all muddled up, which makes it a difficult film to follow in terms of sequencing. After your first viewing though, you'll get a grip of it. Uma Thurman pulls off her role as The Bride exceptionally well and you get a real sense of authenticity portrayed through her character. Helping her on her quest around the world for revenge is the Samurai sword expert Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba). This character brings about the oriental feel to the film, and also humor through his bickering with his annoying assistant. The first scene we witness is the killing of Vernita Green aka Copperhead (Vivica Fox) in her home, kitchen utensils and all. It's a fantastic scene and the gruesome display of blood is shockingly realistic, preparing the viewer for the real action that is to happen. There's also the fantastic scene between The Bride in her comatose state of mind when the evil nurse, Elle Driver, aka California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah) proceeds to inject her in one of the most brilliant scenes of the film. Then there's the gruesome scenes between Buck (Michael Bowen) and a welcome return from Michael Madsen as Budd, aka Sidewinder.<br />Under Bill are killers like O-Ren Ishii, aka Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), whose introduction, via the Japanese Animation, was great. After this we see one of the greatest scenes of the entire film after about an hour when Cottonmouth dispatches of Boss Tanaka (Jun Kunimura) who works on her team. He questions her Chinese/American heritage and is unhappy about a female boss leader, and the speech she delivers after his beheading is truly a classic! Under Cottonmouth is her personal assistant, lawyer and translator, Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), who was present at the slaughtering of The Bride. When The Bride seesSofie once again, she is pretty bitter about what Sofie let have happen to her. What we hear has happened to Sofie at the hands of The Bride is truly unbelievable.<br />Another of Cottonmouth's women is a little girl, Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), who is more deadly than she looks. Her school girl sound and look is very interesting, while her confrontation with The Bride highly entertaining and definitely one of the highlights of the entire film! The violence is at a real high here and the ball-and-chain moments are truly tense. The final demise of Cottonmouth is truly spectacular in the Japanese garden, decorated with snow and feeling very authentic and representative of the popular culture of Western martial arts flicks. The fight scenes just before this with Cottonmouth's company of masked men is truly amazing too, but the scenes of black and white are a big disappointment. I know they had to be censored because of violence, but it still takes away from the overall brilliance of the film.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />Overall Kill Bill - Volume 1 is one of the best films I think that I have ever seen. It was definitely the best film of 2003, only overshadowed by The Return Of The King! People are moaning about this film containing too much violence. These are obviously the conservative losers of Middle America who think that violence doesn't exist! We live in a world filled with it! God knows everyone knows it in the current world we live in...<br />People need to stop thinking of this film as trashy, because it is anything but! The film itself is based on old martial arts film and obviously incorporates that cheesy factor, but this only adds to its brilliance. Quentin certainly knows how to make his money as this film was originally going to be a 3 hour long epic, but he decided to split it in two! Therefore, he makes twice as much money at the box office and on DVD sales. He's not stupid! Look out for a Box Set of Volume 1 and Volume 2 some time this year with tons of special features. There isn't many on this release for a reason! The Soundtrack is also excellent, but that's another review for another time...Sofie once again, she is pretty bitter about what Sofie let have happen to her.

B00009Y3S9|4.0|First things first: This is about Frida the woman, not about her art. Almost none of Kahlo's imagery appear in this movie, except incidentally. That suited me just fine - although I wanted to know more about her artwork, a video isn't necessarily the best way to present static images.<br />Knowing nothing about her life, everything was a surprise - surprises that I'll mostly leave for you to discover on your own. Kahlo's determination was not a surpise, though. After the accident that shaped the rest of her life, that was the driving force that pulled the rest of the movie forward. It got her up and moving, in the most literal way. It was the only source of her skill as a artist - if she had any formal training, the movie glossed over it. It got Diego Rivera's attention (after an unfortunate, prior introduction). It even kept Rivera's attention, as much as it could be kept.<br />A few surreal interludes punctuated the movie. A hospital scene, in particular, had an eerie, macabre look. That certainly captured the pained, drug-addled semiconsciousness that must have come and gone during recovery. It also involved imagery that was distinctly Mexican, suggesting the 'Day of the Dead' icons.<br />Only a few points rang false in this movie. First, the body cast was too all-enveloping. Attending to sanitary needs would not have been possible for someone wrapped up that completely. Second, Kahlo's gait was remarkably strong and straight after the movie's first few scenes. I would have thought that Kahlo's defining accident would surely leave more than superficial scars.<br />On the whole, this was a very enjoyable view of Kahlo as an artist, but mostly as a political activist. Looking just at her paintings, it's hard to remember just how many chances she took with her political involvements.  I suppose, though, that anyone so close to Rivera was already accustomed to a little danger and unpredictability.<br />Hayek presented Kahlo as a physcially diminutive woman. I would like to believe that was an accurate portrayal. It just means that all of Kahlo's strength and energy was wound up even tighter, to fit in such a small package. On the whole, it was a very strong portrayal of a very strong woman. Brava, Frida!like to believe that was an accurate portrayal. It just means that all of Kahlo's strength and energy was wound up even tighter, to fit in such a small package. On the whole, it was a very strong portrayal of a very strong woman. Brava, Frida!
B00006879E|5.0|I got this Cd about a month ago, and let me tell you, this CD ROCKS!!! Every song is worth listening to so buy this CD.  Also, if you like this CD, you should also get Kara's Flowers &quot;Fourth World.&quot;
B000002H97|5.0|I am sick and tired of people calling this album sell out this and sell out that i mean can't they just open their eyes for a second everything sells out eventually i loved Ride The Lightning Master Of Puppets And Justice For All and guess what those albums all sold out my point is don't bash on Good Work because you are only proving on how much of a dumb@$$ you are anyways highlights for me in this album are<br />Wherever i may roam, Sad but true, Nothing else matters, Of Wolf and Man, The God That Failed<br />i never really got into Enter Sandman and The Unforgiven but either way they are still classic Metallica songs
B000002LLC|2.0|Although as a Madonna CD collector it remains one of my least played, I'll go ahead and write a review. Here it is: The one bad thing about pop stars is that they always recycle their sound. Not Madonna. The good thing is is that she took a break and went jazz. Now the album is not 100% jazz, but the music did not quite fit her. I'm sure a lot of Madonna fans may agree with me on this one. Yes, I know she played a lounge singer in Dick Tracy. I'm glad though this caps off with \\"Vogue\\".
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is NOT a CD... this is THE CD. I have a slightly extensive CD collection of 36 CD's and this is my number one. This is what I think.<br />1) Stripped Part 1 - 5/5 - Sorry, but you can't define her.<BR>2) Can't Hold Us Down - 2/5 - Great beat, great voices, great duet, but I'm afraid that this song is sending Christina's youngest fans the wrong message.<br />\\"A guy can be sexual and a girl can't?\\"<BR>    --Christina Aguilera, 2 hr. E! Entertainment Channel Biography?<br />I'm sorry, Christina, but a woman being freely sexual does NOT mean she can have romantic encounters with multiple partners and not be considered \\"dirrty\\". As far as the double-standard you're trying so hard to terminate... give up on the fight because that will only go away when Christianity dies, and as a Christian, I say, \\"sit on a bench and wait for that to happen. Next thing you know, you'll be 100 years old, die, and it still hasn't gone away. That'll NEVER happen, no matter how hard you try to make it disappear. Sorry!<br />3) Walk Away - 5/5 - Very emotional. We do NOT want to be in that situation, male or female.<br />4) Fighter - 5/5 - Sorry Aguilera haters, but this FIGHTER has won! You'll NEVER have as much money as she does or acquire the RICHES she's acquired. Have you ever had a $4.5 million mansion? That's the $4.5 million question. Only COVETOUSNESS can drive a person to PUT DOWN such a WONDERFUL singer like that. You're putting her down because you want her voice and her riches. LOL.<br />5) Primer Amor - 5/5 - But should've been recited in English for ALL listeners to understand.<br />6) Infatuation 5/5 - I was infatuated with Christina's voice but now I wish she made another CD to have the fresh feeling of it once again.<br />7) Loving Embrace - 5/5- Beautiful.<br />8) Loving me 4 me - 5/5 - Preciosa canción. Me encanta.<br />9) Impossible - 5/5 - Impossible not to love.<br />10) Underappreciated - 5/5 - I'm sorry that you're irrefutable talent is underappreciated, Xtina.<br />11) Beautiful 5/5 - Loved the song but hated the gay scenes in the video. It was definitely not a video for little kids to watch.<br />12) Make Over - 4/5 - We get it, Xtina, \\"You don't need nobody tryin' to make you over\\" but you're too angry. Try to calm down and most importantly, not to curse. If you're going to curse, put a \\"Parental Advisory\\" label on the front of the CD cover.<br />13) Cruz - 4.5/5 - Loved the message but slightly hated the composition.<br />14) Soar - 5/5 - The song I listen to when I'm having a bad day. It teaches us how to love ourselves just the way we are and not to try to change just to please others. If you want to please the ones you love, change your ATTITUDE, not your PHYSICAL IMAGE. Someone who tries to oblige you to do that does NOT love you back. Beware.<br />15) Get Mine, Get Yours 3.5/5 - I give it a 3.5/5 because although I love discussing sex, I prefer to discuss it in a way that everyone can hear me and that no one has to leave the room because I've gone too far. The song itself wasn't really racy because it's a very classy way to describe, \\"making love\\", but what completely turned me off was...<br />\\"If you see me with another man, understand you can't question me<BR>the feelings that you caught ain't my fault, I can't help your jealousy<BR>If you can understand the fact what we have has got to be commitment free<BR>Then we can keep this undercover lovin' comin' underneath these sheets.\\"<br />My interpretation of the message, \\"This has got to be commitment free because I have to be free to be with other men if I want to.\\"<br />My opinion, same one I expressed in my review of \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\".<br />Bottomline: Parents, if you don't want your child irremediably corrupted, don't buy this CD for them, just so that they don't have to listen to this song because it's NOT for little kids. Trust me.<br />16) Dirrty - 5/5 - Great song; great video -- but not a great video for North America.<br />17) Stripped Pt 2 - 5/5 Christina openly and fearlessly lets us know, \\"She's not a virgin(...).\\" Nice move. You resolved my doubts.<br />18) The Voice Within - 10/5 - Want to know what to do when things don't go your way? \\"Trust the voice within\\".<br />19) I'm Ok - 5/5 - Glad to know you're ok, Christina.<br />20) Singin' my song 5/5 - You better never stop.<br />That's it. Like it? Great! (...)
B00006879E|5.0|I am more the kind of &quot;stick to what you know&quot;kinda man. But i read some raving reviews abot this band and their album. And to put it in 1 word: WOW! Ab-so-lut-ely superb! I can recommend to anyone!!
B000002KIE|5.0|Firstly, for the multitude of people here crying \\" forget this album The Clash were the real deal\\", do a little research. The Clash would not exist were it not for the Sex Pistols. It was seeing the Pistols live that inspired Strummer to ditch his Pub-Rock band and jump on the Punk-Rock bandwagon. Same goes for The Damned. It was the Pistols who kick-started the scene and kicked open the doors for those bands, and those bands are always the first to admit it. And it was that scene which kicked open the doors for each 'new' variation on Punk, right through from the Dead Kennedys to Crass, Green Day and beyond.     Secondly, (...) about Sid Vicious not being able to play bass, you're right, but here's a simple fact for you. HE DOESN'T EVEN PLAY ON THIS ALBUM. Original bass player/songwriter Glen Matlock was sacked before this material was recorded, so the bass was played by guitarist Steve Jones.    The Sex Pistols didn't play on the album? Rubbish. That's a myth that came about after a lie spread by the newspapers in 1977, and only those who know nothing about the Pistols continue to spread it. Go ask the Producers Chris Thomas & Bill Price who managed to fill an entire DVD with anecdotes, explanations and examples of exactly who played what on the album...and I somehow think they know a little better than YOU!     The Sex Pistols were a manufactured band? Wrong again. The guitarist and drummer had been playing together since 1972. 'Kutie Jones & The Sex Pistols' emerged in 1975. They were hanging around Malcom Mclarens shop, and they needed a bass player. An assistant in the shop, Glen Matlock, was a bassplayer. So they asked him to join. Then THEY hassled Malcom to Manage them and he introduced them to Johhny Rotten. Hardly a 'manufactured band' eh?    And The Ramones?: Here's the HUGE thing about Never Mind The Bollocks. Play the first Ramoes album, and you can immediately hear a million over-used Doo-Wop and 1950's Rock And Roll cliches, just played at double speed. The reference points are so blatant (and un-punk) that it's laughable. Now do the same for NMTB. What reference points are YOU hearing there? There are plenty, but unlike The Ramones, they are far more complex and virtually non-existant to the casual music fan. Oh and by the way, The Ramones NEVER 'came first'. Do a little research. The Pistols and Ramones developed in parallel, but on opposite sides of the Atlantic. By the time The Ramones made it to the UK the Pistols were already ruling the British Punk scene.    Every person who reviews this album as being worthless and meaningless really has no concept about Punk and the sheer impact that this album and the Pistols had back in 1976/77. This was their only proper album, and after being signed to their first Record Company,the band lasted less than 2 years. And on the basis of this one album, almost 30 years later we're still here talking about the band and the musuc. If the whole package was REALLY that bad, and it's impact negligible, Never Mind The Bollocks - and it's creators - would have faded from public memory decades ago.     STOP loooking at this album in a MODERN context, and look at it from it's original perspective. It arrived on the scene at a time when Disco and flacid AOR ruled the airwaves, and it sounded like nothing else around. Questions were asked in the Houses of Parliment as a result of this albums release and the Sex Pistols were banned from playing virtually anywhere in the UK. They appeared on the front pages of the national press for a week due to the scandal they and their music caused. Go educate yourself. They made a HUGE difference to music, musical culture, fashion and design. Jamies Sex Pistols artwork, once considered 'weird' and 'shocking' inspired a wave of imitators, and the Punky ripped up lettering style now wouldn't have you looking twice when used in advertising or magazines.    You may not like this album, that's fair enough. But to deny it's value to, and impact upon,modern music, well, that's just showing how little you know, and how ignorant you are.     So, buy this album. It was one of the few albums in modern musical history which has not only changed the face of modern music, but had a cultural impact which continues to reverberate today, throughout the worlds of fashion, design and art. Can't really say that about The Ramones can you?    Oh yeah, and you may be pleasantly surprised to find it contains a fair few stonking tunes aswell!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Judging by the number and contents of the reviews here, one who has not seen the film might be led to believe that this is a film that espouses some sort of polarizing polemics.  What it actually is is a sweet, dreamlike story of two lost people, lost in a foreign land the language and customs and cultures of which they don't understand and lost in their own journeys in life, who met and made a connection and, as the vagaries of life are such, were unable to sustain this bond to the end.  The coda of the film strikes the perfect note and I am not embarressed in the least to say that it puts a lump in my throat every time I watch it.  As already mentioned in many other positive reviews of this film, the acting has a cinema-verite quality and is uniformly fine, especially that of young Scarlett Johansson, whose understated grace and manners belie her age.  Overall, a very, very impressive effort by Ms. Coppola.<br />PS.  I find all reviews here that chastise other reviewers and question their intelligence and sanity for simply having a different opinion than their own to be distressing and unnecessary.  We view films through prisms shaped by the lives we lead and if we can only agree to disagree, perhaps the world can be a better place.
B000089RVX|1.0|You can have bands inspired by the following; the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Ramones, Guns n' Roses, Nirvana - and they don't suck.<br />What is the problem when bands are inspired by recycled, shallow, angsty former boy-band poseurs? They continue to inspire more crappy recycled, angsty, whining poseurs. I'm aghasted to hear if this Amy Lee is inspired by Sarah Maclachlan and Tori Amos. It's like Linkin Park supposedly inspired by the Clash. Rock has &quot;fallen&quot; to filth so low that even Britney's latest album is more ORIGINAL that this garbage, and I'm serious, I meant it as a listener of Zeppelin, Pumpkins and classical music like Mahler and Beethoven.<br />Contribute your 20 bucks to this group and you'll spawn more of Linkin Park imitators.
0316666343|1.0|Having heard wonderful reviews on this book from various sources, i was excited to be using it in psychology class. I began reading immediately...racing through over a 150 pages in the first sitting. In these first pages i was moved by the plot and intrigued by the perspective from which Alice Sebold was telling this tale.However, this was all that appealed to me, i found the writing style extremely immature and rather tedious. There were numerous times where i just wanted to put the book down amd give up on it...the only thing that propelled me forward was the prospect that perhaps the latter part of the book would live up to it's raving reviews...unfortunately i was let down as the book ploughed on with it's prosaic narrative. And so for it's monotony  and it's frivolity, i give this novel 1 star.
B000002H33|5.0|I had vaguely heard of Metallica when I bought this album (without having heard a single note of it) when it was first released in 1986. It was much heavier and faster than the more mainstream metal of Iron Maiden and Judas Priest that I was listening to at the time, and while I never became a serious devotee of thrash metal, this remains one of my favorite discs of all time.<br />First of all, though, this is not Metallica's best album; it is a very close second to the follow-up, ....And Justice For All, if only because the band's songwriting skills absolutely peaked on that album. Having said that, you could definitely hear where the band was going here, and that they had moved light years ahead of Kill 'Em All and Ride The Lightning (possibly the most overrated Metallica album). This is the one that turned them into the Led Zeppelin of my generation.<br />&quot;Battery&quot; opens the disc by first lulling you with its acoustic classical guitar lines, then blasting you out of your chair with its monster riff and breakneck tempo. The title track is an absolute masterpiece (no pun intended), maybe one of the two or three best metal tracks ever. &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot; will raise the hair on the back of your neck with its eerie lyric content. And finally, &quot;Damage, Inc.&quot; pretty much sums up the band and the musical movement they were a part of in a deafening, four-minute blast.<br />The songs are long, but the constant riffage and changes keep you interested, and unlike Metallica's first two records, there is no filler whatsoever. This album has held up wonderfully for nearly twenty years and still sounds fresh today. Pick this one up!
B000002JSR|5.0|It really makes me mad when people say an album sucks just because it is not as good as the band's other albums.  &quot;Coda is a great album.  I'm not saying it is as good as their&quot;Untitled&quot;<BR>fourth album.  It has great songs, good guitar and lyrics, and good drumming.  I recommend it to anyone who loves Zep.
B000002H97|4.0|I have never understood why this album caused such a flap with Metallica's hardcore fans. Some day, go back and listen to each Metallica record from &quot;Kill 'Em All&quot; all the way through &quot;...And Justice For All.&quot; This was a constantly-evolving band, and no two of their records sound alike at all.<br />Okay, back to &quot;Metallica.&quot; The first thing you notice is that it sounds incredibly good, thanks to Bob Rock's flawless production and nine painstaking months in the studio. Lars Ulrich and Jason Newsted actually sound like a rhythm section on this record instead of a backbeat for James Hetfield's pounding riffs. The songs have more of a traditional rock edge to them, but the guitar sound is as heavy as ever, if not more so. Highlights of this record include &quot;The God That Failed,&quot; &quot;Wherever I May Roam,&quot; &quot;Nothing Else Matters,&quot; &quot;Sad But True,&quot; and &quot;The Unforgiven.&quot; I purposely omitted &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; because I got sick of hearing it on the radio. <br />This isn't Metallica's best record, but it is damn good, and still heavy and rockin'. Don't be fooled by the narrow-minded rivetheads who want a band to sound the same on every record.
B0000507R0|5.0|None of the previous reviews have mentioned how this version actually sounds. I'm familiar with the album, it's one of my favorites. But is it worth buying on SACD? Does it sound better than the regular CD? Thanks.
B000002H2H|3.0|I just don't get the rave reviews for this album. &quot;Creeping Death,&quot; &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls,&quot; and &quot;Fade To Black&quot; are great songs, but that's about it. This could have easily been an EP. You can no doubt hear the progress the band is making from their first album, &quot;Kill 'Em All,&quot; but they are not there yet on this one. Other than the three songs mentioned above, nothing on this record really grabs you like a good metal song should. Average at best.
B000001Y79|3.0|I like this album, even thoguh it's really old (almost 10 years)<br />1. Spiderwebs- Really good way to start the album, really energetic. 9/10<BR>2. Excuse Me Mr. Not as good as previous song, but still pretty good. 8/10<BR>3. Just A Girl- First single, and I can understand why! It's so good! 10/10<BR>4. Happy Now- Not too good, but stil ok! 7/10<BR>5. Different People- Favorite song! It's not even as fast as the others, it's jsut really good. 10/10<BR>6.Hey You- Um, this song is very interesting. 8/10<BR>7. The Climb- I think this was too long but it's stilkl a decent song.  6/10<BR>8.Sixteen-The guitar is so cool! 10/10<BR>9.Sunday Morning- It starts out really weird but it's still a great song! 8/10<BR>10.Don't Speak- The verses are good, the chorus is awful. 5/10<BR>11.You  Can Do It- This song is ridiculous, sorry No Doubt. 3/10<BR>12.World Go Round-This album's second half is proving to be bad. 3/10<BR>13.End It On This- Way better then the 3 songs before. 7/10<BR>14. Tragic Kingdom- YAY! Perfect! 10/10
B00008O89K|4.0|The epic score to Conan the Barbarian is so huge, massive, gigantic and powerful that there are no words to aptly describe just how big it is. It's one of the hugest scores ever written.<br />Basil Poledouris is the man responsible. And while it's not as accomplished as his score for Conan the Destroyer this CD is a must have for movie and music fans. From the powerful opening 'Anvil of Crom/Riders of Doom' to the ethereal sounds of 'Atlantean Sword' to the sumptuous and exotic waltz of 'The Orgy' (a stunning, glorious track which was, amazingly co-composed by Poledouris' 7 year old daughter), the music takes back in time and space to the Hyborean age. With no modern influences this is the music of Conan's world.<br />What cripples this score though is the lack of a dominant theme. This would later occur, very strongly, in Conan the Destroyer. Here however, many different themes are visited just once and never brought back. So there's not much tying the CD together, it feels a bit unwholesome.<br />The Varese Sarabande release of this score contained a few more tracks but it's now very hard to find (much like the Varese release of Conan the Destroyer) so for now you'll have to make do with the more widely available Milan release. If it comes down to a choice between the two then Conan the Destroyer is certainly the superior score.

B000148KK2|4.0|I've been a fan of Diana Krall for about 10 years now and have all of her albums.  She is a consummate jazz singer and pianist. My only real criticism of the album is that it is too subdued, almost depressing at times. I think she's at her best on lively, upbeat numbers where she can show off her jazz chops with her excellent combo mates Anthony Wilson and John Clayton. &quot;Live in Paris&quot; and All For You&quot; are most representative of this.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|&quot;Love Actually&quot; is not a complex film, nor is it a terribly deep film. Nevertheless, it accomplishes its goal of expressing, in simple (but not simplistic) terms some of the different kinds of love people experience in life. It begins with the message &quot;Love, actually, is all around&quot; and it maintains that course throughout the film.<br />Among the many different types of love the film covers are first love, new love, seasoned love, love on the rocks, frustrated love, unexpressed love, unrequited love, love between strangers, love between friends, love between parent and child, love between brother and sister, platonic love, dangerous love, and of course, lots and lots of romantic love. It doesn't explore any of these in a particularly deep fashion, but we do get the variety of experiences and feelings that can be labelled under that most simple name: love.<br />The film is carried by an excellent soundtrack, a compliation of great songs including a soulful number by Norah Jones and one of Dido's best songs, and some well-turned performances by some really great actors. While you won't see Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, or Liam Neeson at their dramatic best, you will see some solid, believeable performances from each of these and the many other folks in the film. The actors alone make this movie worth watching.<br />In the end, take the movie for what it is... not too serious, not too deep, but attempting to express one of the simplest and most basic of themes: &quot;Love, actually, is all around.&quot;<br />In such times as these, I can live with that. In fact, I rather enjoyed it.
B00005KK4P|4.0|This complete Schubert set finds Bohm at his most congenial.  The performances are neatly played, the phrasing is elegant, and the sound is excellent.  However, I do find Bohm a trifle serious in the early symphonies - and the competition out there is fierce in 8 and 9.<br />Bohm's is the finest set I have heard - certainly preferable to the grim, humorless Harnoncourt and the rather heavy-handed Karajan.  But not one of Bohm's individual performances here would be my first choice.  Here are my preferences on a &quot;pick &amp; choose&quot; basis.<br />#1.  Beecham here is simply irresistable.  He captures the youthful joy and exuberance of the 16 year old Schubert much more effectively than does Bohm.  This is available on an import Sony CD, coupled with Beecham's non pareil 2nd and a great 8th.<br />#2.  See #1.<br />#3.  Beecham's EMI account is my favorite version.  If you are interested in hearing a faster, more &quot;classical&quot; reading, the live Carlos Kleiber/Chicago account (Melodram) is much better than his rather driven DG version with the VPO.  I should also mention here a nice Monitor LP reading by Georg Ludwig Jochum, who never got the credit he deserved (he was Eugen's younger brother).<br />#4.  The Markevitch/BPO on DG is very well-played, if a bit brisk.  My favorite here is an old Supraphon LP with Kurt Redel and the Czech Philharmonic:  warm, rather slow, with those wonderful, gurgling Czech winds.  It should be on CD.<br />#5.  Beecham's EMI account is one of his greatest recordings.  A more uptempo, &quot;classical&quot; reading by Fritz Busch is in great need of a CD transfer.<br />#6.  Here, I feel Beecham (EMI) is simply unrivalled:  this is the finest &quot;Little C Major&quot; I have heard.<br />#8.  There is a long list of great recordings here.  My very favorites are the live Furtwangler (DG), Mengelberg (Pearl), Abendroth (Berlin Classics) and the wonderful Fritz Lehmann with the Berlin Philharmonic on an old DG LP.  That really needs to be on CD, coupled with Lehmann's definitive account of the complete incidental music from &quot;Rosamunde.&quot;  The Beecham on Sony is another great one:  his 2nd mvt. rendition is best of all.<br />#9.  Furtwangler &amp; the Berlin Philharmonic is the very finest I have heard - it's coupled on DG with a noble Haydn 88th.  Other favorites include Knappertsbusch (Orfeo), Rosbaud (Wergo), Schuricht (Scribendum), Mengelberg (the studio version on Tahra), and Clemens Krauss (Teldec).  If you like Toscanini, his 1941 Philadelphia account is his best (in poor sound on RCA).  Unfortunately, Beecham never recorded #9 (and likewise #4).<br />Bohm's is a great complete set in good sound.  But if you are more interested in finding the greatest performances of each symphony, the ones I have listed above are worth exploring.eds to be on CD, coupled with Lehmann's definitive account of the complete incidental music from &quot;Rosamunde.&quot;  The Beecham on Sony is another great one:  his 2nd mvt. rendition is best of all.<br />#9.

B00005JKN9|1.0|Terrible, which is sad because it had so much promise. The beginning has a compelling hook, but the subsequent story falls exponentially downward. By the end, you are so far in the pit of apathy that you wonder if doing dishes would have been more exciting. The plot takes so many twists with no real adhesive theme that every half hour it feels like a different movie, and the writing is both cheesy and boring, making the characters completely unbelievable. DiCaprio and Diaz did a decent job of making their pathetic characters somewhat realistic, but honestly there is no saving this movie. The only better-than-average aspect is Daniel Day-Lewis' acting skills. He miraculously portrayed layers in his role and he was almost always believable, despite the writing. I suppose the cinematography, costume design, graphics, and other technical aspects were pretty good as well.  Maybe they figured that super cool fighting scenes with lots of blood would keep people from realizing that the screenplay is devoid of any real quality. However, I firmly believe that this film proves the point that brilliant directors can make mediocre movies and still receive more credit than they deserve only because of their status. At the same time, truly innovative directors, because they don't have funds or access to well-known production corporations or large-scale PR gimmicks, are often overlooked. Don't get me wrong, I think Scorcese has done some excellent work in the film industry and I don't want to undermine his credibility. However, I don't think movies that look like they are scotch-taped together should get more praise than they deserve because they are attached to a well-known name. Bottom line: don't waste your time or money on &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; when you could spend a more productive 3 hours feeling the stucco on your wall.
B00018HULS|5.0|It begins, languid and slow, as Sia murmurs, subdued, trance-like, &quot;You don't know me, you can't hold me, I'll slip through your hands, I am one single grain of sand.&quot;<br />But we do know Sia Furler - as the fragile, enigmatic voice behind Destiny and Distractions on Zero 7's Simple Things. But do we really know Sia beyond the voice? If you listen to this album, you will. There's more to Sia than her &quot;jazzy slurs&quot; and easy-listening urban R&amp;B-influenced reputation.<br />Her second album, Colour The Small One, is intimate and confiding, a private paint-box of myriad shades, a lonely cry for help. In Sunday, the Australian singer's childishly vulnerable voice pulls you closer, as she pleads &quot;for those with guilt, for those who wilt under pressure, no tears over spilt milk&quot;. A simple, poignant piano melody introduces Breathe Me, as Sia admits, &quot;I am small and needy.&quot; Co-written with Beck, The Bully is a morally-weighted purging of suppressed guilt juxtaposed with Sweet Potato, a charmingly eccentric, happily-ever-after love song.<br />A return to the recurring theme of culpability comes with Don't Bring Me Down, a lilting plea to resist the vulnerability that emotions bring. Later, in Natale's Song, she surrenders reluctantly until she embraces her capitulation completely in The Church Of What's Happening Now as she exhorts us to &quot;throw away yesterday&quot;. Sia tightly restrains her voice through most of the album, only breaking free, loose and confident, on the final song, Where I Belong, where she spirals wildly before finally finding redemption at the end of it all. &quot;And soon you will see that we are blessed and complete, there's a place here for you with me.&quot;
B0001HLVSC|5.0|This movie is like being transported back in time and watching a live documentary about warships, only great acting and storyline are added.  This film has great action, superb dialogue, and stunning visuals.  I missed a lot by not seeing this movie when it was in theaters, especially since I do not have surround-sound speakers in my home.<br />From realistic battles scenes to graphic operations on the wounded, this movie is a roller-coaster ride of greatness.  One could almost become seasick watching Russell Crowe and the rest of the cast in this accurate example of how battles were fought on the open sea in 1805.  This movie is one of the years best, boasting a very believable screenplay and enough beautiful shots to fill up a few National Geographic magazines; the shots of Galapagos Islands were amazing.<br />This is a great addition to anyone's DVD collection; one that is just as good the second and third time you watch it.  Buy it today.  Enjoy it for years to come.<br />See ya next review.<br />[...]
B000099T2L|3.0|It's clear that Beyonc&eacute; Knowles aspires to the upper echelons of the pop elite - namely, the group of single-monikered divas (Whitney, Mariah, etc.) who seem to have some sort of muscular problem that requires them to twist their arms in bizarre poses above their heads whenever they have their photos taken. Oh, and they all need to have buns of steel, perfect bodies and a fondness for those never-ending woah-woahs as well.<br />Without the support of Destiny's Child, however, Beyonc&eacute;'s self-confidence is a bit wobbly, like on Naughty Girl where her vocals lack the attitude required by the punchy beats. Sadly, although the bootylicious songstress tries hard to show her sexy, grown-up side by leaning towards slower ballads, even guest stars like boyfriend Jay-Z and Missy Elliot can't stop them from being tedious and forgettable.<br />I'm not dissing Beyonc&eacute;'s singing abilities - the girl can warble like a fat old lady wearing a horned helmet singing Wagnerian opera. It's just that in her eagerness to pay tribute to the greats of R&B by sampling Donna Summer and roping in Luther Vandross for a ballad that doesn't put one note past the 1980s, Beyonc&eacute; has cannibalised their sounds without having the good grace to cook them in new sauces.<br />Perhaps it all boils down to the fact that I'm so envious of Beyonc&eacute;'s Stair-Mastered body and tousled hair that I don't really give a damn about her musical assets. I'm sure a lot of her fans feel the same and if the skimpy outfits she wears on the sleeve are anything to go by, Ms Knowles doesn't seem to mind too much.

B000148KK2|5.0|The most famous export of the small Canadian coastal city of Nanaimo, British Columbia (with the tasty chocolate-custard Nanaimo bar running a close second), sultry jazz diva Diana Krall is back with a brand-new husband, brand-new songs and a brand-new album. The Girl In The Other Room finds the singer/pianist collaborating with husband Elvis Costello on six original compositions (out of twelve songs in total), a choice that's resulted in a more openly personal musical experience. Though some may be tempted to play spot-the-Costello-influence (the confident rendition of Bonnie Raitt's Love Me Like A Man, perhaps?), Krall holds her own with ease ­ but did anybody doubt it after 2001's The Look Of Love?<br />Interestingly, though most of her previous releases dealt with love, love and more love, this new album isn't as explicitly romantic, as if Krall has been able to lay aside her yearnings and, quite literally, start singing a different tune.<br />The album begins with Mose Allison's Stop This World, followed by the Krall/Costello-penned title track with its quiet, lonely heroine, then by I've Changed My Address which describes Krall's returning to her jazz club roots only to discover that the club has been turned into a sports bar.<br />Narrow Daylight is artlessly beautiful, more gentle gospel pop than true-blue jazz, but as Krall draws to an increasingly intimate conclusion, it is Departure Bay that really stands out in its poignant revelations of her courtship with Costello and of her family's first Christmas without her mother.
B00000DC10|3.0|Jesus H!!!!!  I can't believe people think there's any hardcore or punk in this record.  Punk fans, please pay attention.  You will hate this!  If you like lame metal records like Godsuck or Mudvayne or Korn, etc, by all means get this.  It's very good at what it does, but do not be fooled that it's even remotely punk because it has the word punk in the title or because it's on Epitaph.  Epitaph puts out tons of non-punk stuff (Tiger Army, Death by Stereo, etc).  Please believe me - save your money!!!!!!
B000088E6D|4.0|Every so often, the merry-go-round that is the entertainment industry decides it's time to recycle material from the Thirties/Forties/Fifties/insert appropriate decade here. If Diana Krall is this generation's self-appointed equivalent of Ella Fitzgerald, then 25-year old Canadian crooner Michael Bubl&eacute; is trying very hard to be a modern day Frank Sinatra.<br />Despite the mature, rich vocals straight out of the Fifties, however, Bubl&eacute; lacks the charisma and panache that typified the stars of that era. Championed by &uuml;ber-pop producer David Foster and former Canadian PM Brian Mulroney, Bubl&eacute; presents a montage of mid-20th century music that cashes in on the current nostalgia for the 'good old days'. The inclusion of swingin' covers of Van Morrison (Moondance) and Frank Sinatra (Come Fly With Me) lulled me into a false sense of security which was then shattered by some undistinguished rehashes of stuff my mum listens to (George Michael, Paul Anka, The Bee Gees).<br />Bubl&eacute; stated that the last thing he wanted to do was make a tribute album. In spite of these words, however, it's glaringly obvious that this album attempts to pay tribute to a bygone age by trying to emulate the carefree, swaggering slickness of the Rat Pack. That might not be a very original or progressive statement of intent, but it does result in a polished and well packaged slice of easy listening.<br />Simply put, judging from the kind of music he sings here, Michael Bubl&eacute; was born half a century too late. Either that or he should be heading straight for Vegas and his own show at Caesar's Palace.
1592400876|5.0|I found it rather disappointing that what first greets my eyes upon seeing the cover was a grammatical error. In the subtitle to the book, two nouns are used to modify a third noun (Zero Tolerance Approach). At the least, &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; should be hyphenated. This same mistake is repeated on the title's page.<br />I assume that this was done by the American publisher. (Generally, authors have no say over the jacket-cover's appearance.)<br />I am surprised that Ms. Truss didn't choke on her tea during her American book-tour, upon seeing the cover.<br />The book itself is a delight, and compares favorably to Karen Elizabeth Gordon's book &quot;The Well-Tempered Sentence,&quot; which was published in 1983.

0393317552|5.0|Diamond's careful analysis of how geography influences the development of societies is one of those ideas that stick in your head and change your thinking on a whole host of other subjects. It isn't so much a new scientific theory, but a new way of looking at things. The feeling I came away from the book with is that the world is really a very small place: we may think that everything has been tried, and what succeeded was the best, but in reality the whole course of human history has been shaped by a handful of accidents, like the shapes of the continents, the social behavior of certain large animals, the nutritional value of certain plants, and so on. Along with Dawkins' The Selfish Gene and Ayer's Language, Truth and Logic this is one of those books I'll force my children to read.
B000069AUI|4.0|For about a decade now, the commercial world of music has been living in shambles; and for the most part, there's very little greatness to show for it. Shame on the record companies for being so narcisistically formulaec. Still, as the ones holding the reins aren't the brightest of people, it's no great surprise that the industry accidently let some good songs slip out. What's stunning is that they come to us by a simple band called Coldplay.<br />Simplicity can be great and very beautiful. But years and years of it make me numb. Unless there's something really special about it, like PERSONALITY. The last great frontman was Axl, and Chris Martin is nowhere near as talented ... HOWEVER, he's got something to him that I thought human beings had lost for good; he walks the fine line between insane and genius, somewhat like Thom Yorke (though here endeth the Radiohead comparisons). And he's got one up on Axl, in that he's a nice guy. Whenever this combination happens, you know you've got a winner. On their own, I don't know how well these songs would fare. But in the custody of Chris Martin, the results are completely mesmerizing. I watch him play his piano, and even as a pianist myself, I forgo observing the &quot;bad technique&quot;. This guy's got his own technique, his own form of expression, which is mandatory in order to unlock the vault to the music (how many pianists would really prefer an upright?). I don't know anything about his past, but something that has grown within him just oozes out all around him when he is performing. There's a great aura of mystery, which is always a plus for a rock star. I think I do call it genius. A genius with a mission, trying to figure out where exactly to put back those loose screws. Chris, I wish you luck on your quest.<br />The clincher to these songs is the sincerity. Three chords haven't sounded so profound in a LONG time. There's even &quot;hooks&quot; and catchy melodies, to help reel in the {those} who otherwise probably wouldn't pick up on the effective subtleness of the music. (Sorry though, you're no Bon Jovi, as you claimed on stage). When listening to songs like &quot;In My Place,&quot; &quot;The Scientist,&quot; and &quot;Warning Sign&quot;, I want to cut my hands and bleed all over the cd player with them. That's how much magic is in the music of Coldplay.<br />My only complaint is, just as with the Norah Jones album, there's little diversity. By themselves, the songs are great, but as an album, there's a dreary mellowness that never varies. That's a great thing for a cohesive theme and atmosphere, yet they allowed no room whatsoever for a &quot;multi-personality-jouney&quot;, which in this band's case, would have made the album even stronger. Don't be afraid to take a cue from Floyd, you're worth it!<br />So here's a bottom line; IF you can detect the beauty in subtle insanity, AND you can distinguish these songs as being different than all other &quot;Alternative Music&quot; (the worst term ever), then you are cleared to purchase A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD, a true gem. Not the best thing ever, but good music. GREAT songs.
6303282237|5.0|The imagery in this film is magnificent, with lavish, spectacular sets and vast battle scenes. The cast is great, with beautiful performances by Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren; they have terrific chemistry together, and how the camera loves them ! This was Heston's follow-up to Ben Hur, and he is equally heroic as Spain's hero El Cid. Others in the cast of note are Raf Vallone as Count Ordo&ntilde;ez, the man who also vies for Loren's  love, and Genevieve Page, as Princess Urraca, who is secretly enamoured with El Cid. Herbert Lom, though one can only see his eyes, is marvelous and fiery as Ben Yussuf, the Moorish invader who says to his followers, &quot;burn your books, make warriors of your poets, and make your doctors invent new poisons for our arrows !&quot;.<br />Directed by Anthony Mann, the 11th century pageantry and medieval feel of this film has been meticulously created, and the cinematography, shot on location in Spain by Robert Krasker, is superb. The war-torn history of a divided Spain has been skimmed over and highly romanticized, but is very entertaining. There are family conflicts galore, murders and treachery, and lots of sword fights, where what amazed me was the sound of metal against metal; it has never to my knowledge been rendered so well, and adds much reality to the action.<br />Surprisingly, the art/set direction and song/score were nominated for Oscars, but did not win. The score by Miklos Rozsa is fabulous, but unfortunately it was up against Mancini's &quot;Breakfast at Tiffanys&quot;. Sophia Loren received a Best Actress Oscar for this year, but not this film; she won it for &quot;Two Women&quot;, which was also released in 1961. Total running time is 180 minutes.<br />History has many versions of El Cid (1040 ?-1099), depending on who wrote it (the Moors of course, painted him with a harsher brush), and at one point it seems he was a soldier of fortune, but based on the epic &quot;Poema del Cid&quot;, he was both man and legend, and &quot;one who lived and died the purest knight of all&quot;. This marvelous film has not been given the attention it deserves, and it will be enjoyed by everyone who likes historical dramas, and for Heston fans it is a must.one who lived and died the purest knight of all&quot;.

B0000640VM|5.0|I saw this movie when I was little and became obsessed with it. I would sing the songs on the schoolbus, dance to them, listen to them constantly, sing along in-character. This movie has everything, and I mean everything! It's severely underrated. Rita has always been a personal friend of mine; she reminds me of, well, myself, and I always loved her best. It was a dream of mine in childhood to have a plush Rita, and the day I acquired one was a very happy day indeed, and I even recall the date! I adore Georgette, Dodger, and everybody else as well. But aside from my love for the characters, what's important to know is that this is a must-see animated masterpiece!
B000001GPX|5.0|I honestly wouldn't care if Kleiber's version of the 7th were terrible (which it isn't) because his 5th is nothing short of astounding.  This is THE 5th to own - hands down.<br />Kleiber has the Vienna Philharmonic playing this music as if they were playing it for the first time.  The energy found in the first movement is nothing short of astounding.  The players are on fire.  The second movement is as beautiful as the first is frenetic.  The balance created by the Vienna Philharmonic is beautiful and offers a poignant statement rarely heard in the many &quot;routine&quot; run throughs of the symphony.  The scherzo is filled with the same gusto found in the opening allegro and leads into the amazing finale.  In short, this 5th is beyond anything you have ever heard before - not only because the playing is perfect, but because Kleiber's interpretation breathes life into one of the most familiar pieces of music of all time.  He brings out nuances in the score, highlights unique moments, and offers incredible incite into one of Beethoven's most moving musical achievements.<br />Although there are some complaints about the seventh, its still a fantastic run-through and Kleiber has a lot to say here as well.  Even if you disagree with his interpretation, Kleiber still has created a fascinating recording.  Highly recommended.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Fast-paced story of revenge! Highly entertaining; audiences should really end up cheering on The Bride as she battles each enemy--the assassins who betrayed her and attempted to murder her--in samurai style with her Hatori Hanzo sword straight from Japan. This high-energy thriller is an epic masterpiece! It's essentially lots of fun to watch. Some of the head-slicing turns out to be humorous, as everyone lightens up to watch red fountains shoot forth in the midst of a serious story. Danger lurks around every plot twist, such as the formidable Go Go and her crazy ball-and-chain. Each part of the movie is an exciting adventure, including the anime segment. It grabs you right at the beginning and holds you in suspence until the end--which is, incidentally, a cliffhanger! &quot;Kill Bill&quot; leaves you wanting the next volume.
B000002L68|5.0|After Prince went forward and made a major breakthrough with 1982's &quot;1999&quot; that spawned the hit singles &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; and the dance-pop hit, &quot;1999&quot;, Prince and his new band the Revolution began to write music for the album that made him a superstar called &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. &quot;Purple Rain&quot; was the first album to be credited to the Revolution that featured longtime keyboardist Matt Fink, drummer Bobby Z, bassist Brown Mark, and the fabulous female duo of guitarist/vocalist Wendy Melvoin and keyboardist/vocalist Lisa Coleman. While Prince strays away from his R&amp;B roots in favor of more pop-oriented styles, that doesn't mean he turned his back on soul music since a lot of the album carries soulful elements. Though the soul is still on Prince's mind, he mixes it up with dashes of metal, new wave, pop, and even some traces of psychedelia. &quot;Purple Rain&quot; was the one that helped launch Prince into superstardom. The album opens up with the rocking, &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot;. As Lisa Coleman's wailing organ and Prince's gospel-like sermon ends, Bobby Z's rhythmic elctric drum tracks comes with metal-blazing guitar riffs and wailing keyboards. Then, there are the puncy bass lines that come in. Next, there is the smooth and psychedelic tune, &quot;Take Me With U&quot;, as it opens with the mid-tempo bass drums and the melodic synthesizers that are accompanied by the pounding bass lines. It's a beautiful duet with the Purple Rain movie co-star, Apollonia. The strings are just wonderful. &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot; is a great R&amp;B-like ballad, which has some great drum work by Bobby Z and Matt Fink's piano and organ-sounding synthesizers are lushy, as well as, great. The tune is about how beautiful women aren't always happy. &quot;Computer Blue&quot; is a funky, pop tune, which is very hard-pounding. The guitar-work and strong backbeat percussion is breathtaking. &quot;Darling Nikki&quot; totally sounds likesomething from his 1980 album, &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;. The song is all about eroticism. The tune has some killer, blazing metal guitars. &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; is probably Prince's greatest song ever. It went #1 on the charts and stayed there for six weeks. The song doesn't have any bass included, it just has percussion, keyboards, and guitars. &quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot; is a up-tempo tune with some great, energetic synthesizer work. &quot;Baby I'm A Star&quot; is a funky, dance-pop song with Prince saying that he doesn't want to stop being a star, until he reaches the top. The spritual-like &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, has to be one of the best compositions Prince has done. The song has some well-focused instrumentation in it. It has a beautiful fusion of guitar, cello, violin, drums, and strings. The album, itself, is a major classic. Every song on here are probably Prince's best  performances ever. His 1982 album, &quot;1999&quot; might've introduced Prince to pop music, but &quot;Purple Rain&quot; was the one that kept the monumental going. It was the album that took pop music to a whole new horizon. &quot;Purple Rain&quot; is truly a pop landmark. The disc will never leave your CD player, trust me. A+
0783226845|5.0|Scent of a Woman, a 1993 Academy Award Nominee for Best Picture, is about a friendship that builds between two opposite people, the blind retired Lt. Colonel Frank Slade and the prep school student Charlie Simms, during a wild weekend in New York City.  Both are coming to a crossroads in their lives. Charlie has to decide whether he will tell on who played a practical joke on the school's headmaster.  But his future is lying in midst of it.  And Lt. Colonel Frank Slade, once an aide to Former President Lyndon Johnson, now blind, is considering taking his own life.  Their friendship grows, and although I don't want to give too much away, I'll say that I was satisfied with the ending.<br />Al Pacino's performance in this was stellar, and have many others have mentioned, won him his first Best Actor Oscar.  Great film which will undoubtedly be enjoyed by many for years to come.

He says &quot;If Pearl Jam does not stop making cds like this , I am not going to buy them anymore&quot;.  If stupidity would be an Olympic event you would be in the Guiness Book of World Records !!!!!!!!  You are writing a review on Creed you chump  !!!<BR>I think people should be required to pass a simple IQ test to write a review here !!!<BR>The cd is great and this group is worth following .  The road to success however is long.  I hope they will not shoot themselves on the foot one day by swelled up heads or too much money or you know what ?<br />A strong BUY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00006V9A0|1.0|This rushed greatest hits CD is a waste, and certainly isn't worth buying for &quot;You Know You're Right&quot;. Of all the songs on here, that one is one of the worst Nirvana has ever done. And so what if it was one of Cobain's last studio recordings? That doesn't make it any good. &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; is an awful and unflattering representation of the talent Kurt Cobain had just begun to show the world on Unplugged. YKYR downright sucks because it's the bait to lure young 'uns into buying this compilation of Geffen's, Love's, and Novoselic's greed. Whenever Kurt played his songs on a distorted electric he drowned the life out of his work, and sang off-key to go match his uneven electric guitar playing. But when he was on acoustic, you could tell he loved what he was doing because he went out of his way to sing and put effort into sounding like he meant what he was performing.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Creed is easily one of the best today.  Some people compare the group to PJ because of the resemblence of Scotts voice; 1: Scott is 10 times a  better singer, 2. The Bass is 10 times better bass guitarist, 3. Guitarist is 10 times bettter guitarist, 4. Drummer, 10 times better drummer and 5. not the least, their compositions hundred times better !!!!  Wake up and smell the roses mate !!  When They talk about these two groups they only compare the singers I dont know why  ??? This is not like supporting Lakers or Celtics you Know !!! There is a clear winner and talent lies with Creed.<BR>I know every body has different taste but some people dont know and understand music !!!  Calling Scott's voice forced vs. eddie's ?? Eddie sounds like a bathroom singer compared to Scott.  You must have listened to too much Metallica and your eardrums must have wore off.  Listen to some Verdi and Mozart operas once in a while.  It will broden your Horizon !(I am not talking about Horizon Air.)<BR>The Album is Superb !!! I couldn't resist but bought two !!!  The second one goes to the local Library    GIVE THE GIFT OF MUSIC.

B000003S0P|5.0|If you are a fan of music in general, Red by King Crimson is a must have. This was the most powerful lineup of members in my opinion. It is sad that the guitarist, who seems to fear success, broke this band up after this record. Had they stayed together who knows what they could have done.
B00006JLX4|5.0|Pavement was the reigning indie band of the 1990s, with their vibrant rock and Stephen Malkmus's deliciously strange lyrics. And at the 10th anniversary of debut &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot;'s release, devoted fans were rewarded with &quot;Slanted and Enchanted: Luxe &amp; Reduxe,&quot; with a wealth of live tracks, new tracks, B-sides and more.<br />The original recording itself is a masterful creation: its includes the whooping &quot;Life Singed Her,&quot; intricate &quot;Trigger Cut/Wounded-Kite At :17,&quot; droning &quot;In the Mouth of a Desert,&quot; gently poppy &quot;Z&uuml;rich Is Stained&quot; and jangling, shimmering &quot;Loretta's Scars,&quot; before wrapping up with the solid acoustic &quot;Our Singer.&quot;<br />But no sooner has the rat-a-tat percussion of &quot;Our Singer&quot; faded out than the new stuff begins: The &quot;Slanted Sessions,&quot; which include the droning &quot;Mercy Snack: The Laundromat,&quot; the catchy rocker &quot;Baptist Blacktick,&quot; a rawer, rougher alternate mix of &quot;Here,&quot; and the shimmery indie &quot;Nothing Ever Happens&quot; (which sounds a bit like the Beatles). The first disc fades out with the John Peel Session #1 -- which has never been released before -- four fuzzy, solid renditions of their songs.<br />The second disc is almost as good, kicking off with the Watery, Domestic tracks: the ear-tingling feedback that opens &quot;Texas Never Whispers,&quot; the sweeping &quot;Frontwards,&quot; and the poppy &quot;Shoot the Singer (1 Sick Verse).&quot; The Watery Sessions are on a somewhat grimmer note with the melancholy &quot;Greenlander,&quot; the gothic-sounding &quot;Sue Me Jack,&quot; and the drizzly &quot;So Stark (You're A Skyscraper).&quot;<br />A second John Peel session -- also never before released -- which starts off on a grey, drizzly note but builds up to the muffled shrieks and roars of &quot;List of Dorms.&quot; Finally, the second disc rounds off to a live performance at London's Brixton Academy in late 1992: A surprisingly clear, sharp-sounding rendition of their songs -- you can almost feel the energy crackling from Malkmus's voice.<br />And accompanying the two discs of music is a thick little booklet the size of a skinny CD jewel case. It doesn't really provide many new insights into the songs themselves, but it does give a look into where the guys from Pavement were before rocketing to indie-godhood. It looks like a bunch of notes pasted together, especially with some scrawled lyrics in the middle of it, written in marker with lines crossed out.<br />Pavement is one of those wonderful bands that have a subtle influence on many of the bands who come after them, such as, for example, Weezer. Their fuzzy, roiling guitar was offset by creative flourishes that can make your heart bleed and your ears tingle. And don't be deceived by the seeming simplicity of these songs -- under the fuzzy guitar and machine-gun percussion are outstanding melodies.<br />Pavement may be gone, but it's not forgotten. And &quot;Slanted and Enchanted: Luxe and Reduxe&quot; is among the best rereleases I've seen yet, with its overwhelming wealth of extras and bonuses. Vibrant and timeless -- and the rarities and B-sides make it even better.n Academy in late 1992: A surprisingly clear, sharp-sounding rendition of their songs -- you can almost feel the energy crackling from Malkmus's voice.<br />And accompanying the two discs of music is a thick little booklet the size of a skinny CD jewel case.

B00005NW02|4.0|People that wont like this CD without even listening to it properly are:<br />1)People Traped in the 70's ( I want more solo's!!!).<BR>2)People who think someone who has darker skin then white is a terrorist.( Kill all Sand N%%g%S)<BR>3)People who love George Bush ( What a ragga muffin he is i love that chap).<BR>4)People who dont know nothing about politics.<br />This aint an AMAZING album but it is good. Reminds me of a heavy version of Mr Bungle, not as diverse though.<BR>It uses influences from varios different metal genres, so i wouldnt label it Nu-metal( Korn, Limp bizcuit talk about the same things and play similar music?)<BR>Any way every one has an opinion i guess, but make it a bit valid.
0375713751|2.0|I agree completely with the raters with the subject lines, \\"I Don't Know Why She Wrote It\\" and \\"Heartbreaking\\".  I am disgusted with the rater who stated that women who do work outside the home are trying to \\"run out\\".  Give me a break.  Maybe you are in the financial position to be able to stay at home with your children.  I would love to stay at home with mine, but it is impossible given my situation.  (...) <br />Anyway, back to the book, I was impressed at the beginning.  Many of her feelings were things I feel myself day to day.  A million things to remember, both at work and at home.  Not enough hours in a day to get them done.  Wanting to do your best in both places.  I found myself laughing out loud at some of the beginning chapters.<br />But, as the book went along, I got more and more frustrated with Kate.  How she didn't appreciate any time with her kids, like when they went on vacation and she was more unhappy being with them than she was when she was at work.  How she was frustrated by their need for her.  How she got into the cyber-relationship with Jack from America.  How she said she put the picture of her kids in her drawer because it made her seem weak.  How she didn't know any information about her children when people asked.  It took her husband leaving and Ben falling for her to wake up.  Then, like some others wrote, she had to quit work in order to be able to manage.<br />Give me a break!  I know many other working moms out there who hold it together way better than Kate, and still actually manage to be intimately involved in their children's lives.  I realize I am not an international money manager, but my job is extremely demanding.  I still know my children's weights, favorite foods, books, toys, etc.!  I love to play with them when I get home from work.  My son's pre-school is actually very close to my work, and I am able to go and visit when they have parties and outings.  We even share an undisturbed 2+ hours together each morning and evening commuting to and from work/school together on the train.  We can play, talk, read stories.  It's wonderful.  And, I bet, more quality time than some stay at home moms spend with their children every day when they have the whole day with them.<br />As I believe the rater of \\"Heartbreaking\\" put it, Pearson's book is a slam against working mothers.  The entire book seems to justify negative thoughts that people have about women who work.  Let me give some of you people out there who actually think that a clue.  I love my children more than anything in the world.  There is never any question as to what is more important: my family or my job.  It's a no brainer.  Yes, I'm stressed out sometimes trying to hold it all together.  Yes, I am sometimes awake until 2 AM getting work and chores done (yes, some of us actually do this stuff as well - we manage to clean our houses, feed our families, and raise our children).  I am sure some things slip between the cracks - maybe vacuuming gets done 1-2 times per week and not 2-3.  Does that make me a criminal - I think not.<br />Read this book if you want some humorous quips about the life of a working mom, but by no means hold it against those of us working moms out there who really do manage to keep it together, at least where it counts!
B000021YQV|4.0|Good effort, most issues coverd on here are political. So it would not be everybodies taste. Musically it goes in different directions of metal/alternative, it certainly isnt complex music but it is not dull either. Definatly worth checking out.

The &quot;Four Agreements&quot; is one of those.

Sheryl Crowe covered it, and really, I can't make out the difference; both versions blow. <br />Basically, the band was trying to make up for releasing an album as coked out as White Light/White Heat. If you like your Velvet Underground spineless, this album's for you!

If pain or fear are felt, it is only very briefly, there is always something to alleviate them.<br />Had he not been chosen as his community's \\"Receiver\\" the main character might have gone on living forever unaware of the sacrifices his people have made in order to gain this painless world.

B000001FG5|5.0|Hey,<BR>A review is actually supposed to be a short informative article and it helps if it is less opinionated rather than more.  Perhaps you are confused.  Many, if not most of us who are reading your rediculous input here like the Bee Gees and aren't really interested in the fact that you dont but might be interested in why you dont, if you told us in an inteligent manner.  For example if you know something technical about production that caused this album not to work well I would be interesed in hearing this.  <BR>A lot of people dont like disco but I think it is fun music. That statement alone however does not make this a review.  So your rather meek ability with sarcasm as well does not constitute a review but something more akin to sticking your tounge out at people who have different opinions.  Adults actually dont do this (you might  want to keep that in mind)
B0000524CY|1.0|I don't see what's so scary about this movie. Maybe it's because I'm an athiest that this doesn't scare me like I was assured it would. Everyone I know and countless reviews have said that this was the scariest movie ever, and I was really letdown when it was just a long, boring, and frankly silly Christian flick. I also read that it might offend you if it didn't scare you. This movie didn't bother me in any way, aside from making me sleepy. It was the same story with Rosemary's Baby, another big letdown for me. I almost don't want to see The Omen for fear of another dissappointment. Once again, I'm an athiest, so this might be scarier for a religous person. That's all I have to say about that.
1592400876|4.0|Although I didn't seek out this book - it was more or less dropped into my lap - I'm very glad that I read it.  I am definitely a stickler for punctuation. It's gotten me into trouble, even. While the book is a bit difficult to read at times (I had some problems translating British words into their American equivalents, and some sections just seemed to drag on and on) I think this book should be practically handed out to every high school student. It baffles me how people manage to go through life without knowing how to use an apostrophe. Literature professors and grammar and punctuation sticklers like myself will love this book from cover to cover, but even those who aren't should at least skim through it. The humor alone is worth it.
1592400876|3.0|There's been too much hype. The book is very short with a very long prologue and yet is still difficult to read. The most I've gotten from it is that punctuation is important and that there are some humorous examples of how adding or omitting punctuation marks can have dramatic effects on meaning.
B000005RG7|5.0|This was a great hard rock release, period!  Great, memorable, well structured songs, and heartfelt, energized vocals all the way.  'Thats the way that it is' is worth the purchase of this CD alone.  What a great, driving rock song that builds up tension, with a great release guitar solo!!!  Uriah Heep rocks.

B00000ADG2|5.0|lauryn hill has a fabulous voice of passion, hip-pop and soul. every single song on this album is essential to listen to, and there are no tracks i would rate less than four stars. she is overwhelmingly talanted at singing, writing, rapping and acting, and she does it by herself with practically no help. that is called brilliance, people! the winner of five prestigious grammy awards, and a no. 1 slot for more than a month on the billboard charts, just reflects her hard effort and work that she put into this beautiful album. Although all the tracks are brilliant, the stand-out ones for me are &quot;ex-factor&quot; &quot;to zion&quot; &quot;every ghetto, every city&quot; &quot;nothing even matters&quot; and &quot;everything is everything&quot;. i hope my comments have helped you decide whether to buy this amazing album or not...

B000002UAX|5.0|This is yet another masterpiece by the &quot;fab four&quot;, seccond only to Sgt. Pepper. Even though there ARE many overdubs on this album, this album was INTENDED to be a studio album. The songs range from melencholy to agressivly uplifting, taking the listener through a myriad of worlds ~ an almost visual experience ~ an accomplishment that not many seem to be able to achieve. <BR> As far as the one star ratings this album recieved, I recommend skipping those nonsensical reviews, and give this album a try.
0618526412|5.0|I feel greatly indebted to Oprah for the simple fact that if she had never chosen this book for her classics book club I would have probably missed out on it entirely. THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER is a gem of American fiction that demands to be read; Carson McCullers has proven herself to be a master at writing about the human condition. Set during the depression-era 1930's in a struggling small town in rural Georgia the characters are continuously battling loneliness and understanding. Events revolve largely around the mysterious mute Singer. As the small town becomes more acquainted with his presence he has gained some unlikely friends who visit him in his boardinghouse room, eat dinner with him at the local cafe, and follow him around town like a spy. <br />The fact that Singer remains a reclusive figure and doesn't reciprocate communication with his guests fails to hamper his popularity. In fact, his mannerisms have resulted in others becoming more attached to him as they mold his companionship to shape their emotional needs for human connects. Sometimes the best friend is someone who just sits and listens without commenting. What his guests fail to know is that Singer himself is battling his own sense of loneliness as a result of his mute friend of ten years being committed to an insane asylum 200 miles away.<br />Carson McCullers has spread a political and social commentary throughout this book. Two of the characters are devoted followers of Karl Marx and his anti-capitalist ideals of how power and wealth should be spread throughout the masses. What better setting then this poor rural town full of squatter housing and unemployment to highlight the difference between the haves and have-nots. Also highlighted are racial undertones that were rampant during this time period. <br />This book is filled to the rim with serious issues of the heart and also society. It speaks volumes to the importance of being linked to others for human companionship. Carson McCullershas created wonderful characters in believable circumstances that are difficult to forget. 5+ stars. Highly recommended.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I got this CD the first day it came out. And I still find myself listening to it almost everyday. This CD's not for kids, and isn't supost to be. Britney wants to be a more adult artist and it shows.There are some great up beat songs, and the song Everytime that she supposedly wrote about Justin.<br />  My favorite song on this CD is Touch Of My Hand, I have always enjoyed sexual up beat songs that don't hold back. You have to admire someone who really puts themself out there. And she does this with this CD.
B00005ATZT|5.0|I have only one word to describe the fugitive......AWESOME.  Definitely the best action drama of the last decade.  The script is perfect.  The acting.... flawless.  The show deserved the Oscar Best Movie nomination.  Most of all, TLJ was a well deserved Best Supporting Actor winner.<br />Definitely Harrison Ford's best performance since Indiana Jones.

In order to prove his father wrong he begins a quest for fame and fortune in the rock n' roll world only to find out that money isn't everything and in the end there are things more important that wealth. Now on the music, it reflects very well within the story. Blackie Lawless uses electric and acustic guitars in order to make an impact to the listener, it works! (at least for me). His voice has improved on this record as he show you a wide range of emotions: anger, happiness, sadness you named it this record has it. Also it should be noted the drummer: He's amazing as he uses different style from the military to the tribal like. This is how drums should sound on every record and not just metal. Every song is well constructed highlights being Invisible Boy, Chainsaw Charlie, I am One &amp; The Idol.<BR>The bottom line is that you should go and buy this record all the props given to this album by me and other people are well deserved.
B000148KK2|1.0|If you could call this music.  The lyrics, the music every thing about this Cd is bad.  I think Diana's heart was not at all with this project, its just plain flat and hard on the ears.  With Diana's previous efforts of her craft they were enjoyable because of her style of music. I hope she goes back to what works because this isn't the Diana Krall I like.  This Cd was hard to listen to and I would not come back to this Cd again.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|I was actually going to inquire about two songs that I heard during the movie Volume 2, but I've already found one of the titles which was &quot;About Her&quot;.<br />Awesome song if anyone hasn't heard it.<br />The other song I'm looking for plays right after the characters appear during the credits.  It's not the guitar themed song that plays while Uma is with her daughter.  The only reason I know this song exists is because we were let into the theatre early and the credits happened to be playing while we were searching for seats.  If anyone can help, I would truly appreciate...
0792842723|5.0|GoldenEye is one of the best Bond movies ever made! Pierce Brosnan does a great job in his first outing as 007, just as Samantha Bond as Miss Moneypenny and Judi Dench as M. Sean Bean portrays Alec Trevelyan, Agent 006, who betrays Bond and becomes his enemy. Playing the baddie seems to be Bean's specialty (i.e. Patriot Games). The Bond girls are great as well. Izabella Scorupco plays computer programmer Natalya Simonova and Famke Janssen plays sadistic femme fatale Xenia Onatopp. My favorite scene (besides the pre-credits sequence) is the tank chase through St. Petersburg. Bond driving a tank! Just great! Next to &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, &quot;GoldenEye&quot; is one of the best Brosnan Bond films.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As usual, Fox puts a brilliant show on Friday nights and then kills it before it has a chance (Wonderfalls, we hardly knew ye.)<br />Firefly was the creation of Joss Whedon, the man behind Buffy. This show, other than it's snappy dialogue and quirky heroes, bears no relation though. It's a sci-fi western about a crew of smugglers and their prostitute boarder-a career both legal and respectable in the future-who live on the fringes of space eeking out a living on not exactly legal activities. They must hide from the goverment and the Reivers, a pack of cannibals who roam the frontier territories with faster ships and tractor magnets. As well as the occasional grudge-holding crime overlord-Captain Reynolds and the gang were an honorable lot and only criminal by necessity. The cast and acting were perfection, the plots were clever and funny and the show was original. So naturally it was doomed to fail. <br />Every episode, including a few that never aired, are assembled for this collection. This includes the pilot. Fox skipped the pilot and aired the episodes out of order for reasons of their own (did I mention how much I hate the Fox network?) The extras include one very funny bonus scene from the &quot;Mrs. Reynolds&quot; episode and some commentary. There is also an easter egg of Adam Baldwin singing &quot;The Hero of Canton&quot; from Jaynestown, mine and Adam's favorite episode. To access it, select bonus features on the fourth disc. Highlight Joss Whedon singing &quot;Serenity&quot; but do not select it. Hit the left arrow, then hit select. <br />It's a shame this show didn't get a better chance. If you never saw it and you enjoy smart writing and smartass characters, you can't go wrong. Buy it. Buy it now!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Jet's newest album Get Born is a great CD to add to any collection, especially if you're into real rock, something pure and powerful. Songs off the new album resemble those of the great rock bands of the past 30 years...AC/DC, etc. From the catchy single &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; to the great ballads like &quot;Look What You've Done&quot; and &quot;Move On&quot;, Get Born proves to be a rockin' album that clearly defines Jet, as well as rock and roll...You should definitely get this CD.
B00005JMEW|2.0|I have to say that I think Tarantino is starting to lose it. . .if in fact he ever really had it.  Kill Bill presents the rather hackneyed theme of a member of a special organization betrayed by said organization and now looking for revenge on everyone who wronged her.  This really isn't the main problem with the movie, though.  I am a tremendous Uma Thurman fan, but she is a very unconvincing character in this movie.  Although she masks her lack of martial arts knowledge acceptably well, she just didn't sell me on her role of a coldblooded killer who has still held on to the humanity and compassion of a mother.  I've always applauded her as an actress, but I have to strongly disagree with Tarantino's choice for this particular role.<BR>  Throughout the movie, I could see a glimmer of what I thought Tarantino was trying to achieve, but I was left feeling that he just fell short and ended up with a movie that was just plain cheesy.  He keeps with his signature technique of jumping around in the timeline which I rather like.  It allows the story to unfold like a thousand exciting discoveries that ultimately meld together into a complete picture.  My compliments end there, though.  His characters acted like they'd been created by a teenage comic book writer.  The fight scenes although action packed, lacked any technical skill.  As for the cinematography, it was mediocre at best.  Frankly, although I tried very hard to accept this movie as a unique artistic endeavor, I ended up finding it simply ridiculous.
074325144X|5.0|This book is the best book on the market that I have read.  It is more than a book though as it takes you through a step by step process.  It gives you the proper form and then gives you exercises that allow you to feel how your body should feel when you are running.  A very, very, practical book! I have read other book on running and tried to incoporate the form into my running, but without success.  With this book I have had very good success as well as gotten rid of my shin splints. The clincher in the book is the picture of the footprints left behind when you run properly which show no forward movement in them compared with regular running which shows a ton(see Tom Brown jr. books for info on reading tracks).  I love this book and highly recommend it to anyone interested in successfully learning how to run better and easier.

1402547064|4.0|There is something about these books that really resonates with some readers. After reading the first novel, I did not really jump on the collective Botswana Bandwagon...  I thought the books were nice, but found nothing exceptional about them.  I am glad that I decided to continue with Book 2 though (that was my favorite so far in the series!)  I decided to pick up the other books, starting with book 2, on Audio CD.  I am much happier with the Audio CD versions than I was with reading the book.  I found that reading the stories was a little tedious for me:  The writing is very simplistic, and oftentimes the stories are very predictable.  While these do show up in the Audio CD, I do not find myself as distracted by them as I did when I read the first two in the series.  The reader, Lisette Lecat is absolutely superb.  She is a native South African, and spent a number of years in Botswana.  She knows the rhythm patterns and speech patterns of the people, and she distinguishes each character with a certain voice. This skill makes the dialogues much more interesting than reading them on the page, and her general narration really make the stories come alive for me.  If it were not for her reading the books, I do not know if I would have stuck with this series.<br />The story of _Kalahari Typing School for Men_ was much like its immediate predecessor, _Morality for Beautiful Girls_.  The novel focuses a great amount on the development of some characters, and leaves others &quot;out to dry&quot;, and ultimately strays away from the things that made books 1 and 2 of the series so good: the cases, the interactions, and the values of the Botswana people.  That is not to say that this book does not have any detective cases, but I find the novels have shifted from their original focus.  However, one thing that I did like about this book is the increased role and development of Mma Makutsi.  She is a great characters, and until book 3, Mma Makutsi existed in the shadows.  I look forward to seeing her develop more in the next books.<br />I plan to LISTEN to book 5 very soon.k forward to seeing her develop more in the next books.<br />I plan to LISTEN to book 5 very soon.
B000001DTM|5.0|The first thing that will strike you about this album: it sounds like it came out in this decade, easily.  This fact alone is what sets musicians apart from other musicians, and off the bat makes this album worth your money without anything being said of its epic content.  <BR>  This has to be U2's most raw CD since War.  The majority of songs on the CD are love songs composed to anonymous women, or songs at least about love.  Bono, in my opinion has always contained an intense poetic propensity to describing how emotions labeled as love affect relationships.  Most rarely though, Bono is unselfish with the production of songs; he has always allowed other band members to contribute or work over lyrics.<BR>  Edge (the guitarist) uses as usual his patented delay and distortion pedals to amplify his classic guitar sound, but also adds an extra 'Berlinesque,' tone his emporium of six stringed instruments. <BR>  Larry Mullen (the Percussionist) comes along slowly and steadily in this album.  Regrettably he is the weakest instrumental link here, (since he had not undergone his formal training in New York yet.)  He still does a more than adequate job, and definitely drags no one down.<BR>  Adam has always been a beast on the bass.  Whether he styles his sounds to flashiness or he sticks to his minimal complimentary guns, he sets an incredible mood picked up on by all the other members of the band.<br />  **Most importantly, this band has unity.  Each player is completely musically on board with every other member.  They compose their own music, (and of course have collaborators such as Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois, Steve Lilywhite, and others) but they really produce what they compose.  That is something that only a handful of popular musicians can say today.  Popular music is so diluted with sound technicians, pitch modifiers, (for vocalists) basically anyone who can poke their nose in and write music for pop icons.<br />  U2 stands alone as the authentic, unblemished rock band that sings deeply and evokes deep emotion.<br />  This CD will move you and blow you away.  It gets better with every listen, something that can't be said for most CD's.<br />  In my top 20 of all time.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot is a band made up of 9 members. Some people think that is stupid but I think thats awesome. That's one of the reasons there one of the best bands. The drumming is great. Joey is probably the best drummer ever. Sid is great on the turntables. Yes this band actually has a person with turtables but it is awesome for what it's used for.<br />There members are:<BR>8- Vocals- Corey Taylor<BR>7- Guitar- Mick<BR>0- Turntables- Sid<BR>6- Custom Percussion- Shawn<BR>2- Bass- Paul<BR>1- Drums- Joey Jordinson<br />3- Custom Percussion- Chris<BR>4- Guitar- James<BR>5- Samples,Media- Craig<br />Them waring masks is also cool. There masks are very cool. Why do people complain about there masks anyway. They say that they don't like the music because of them wearing masks. What does that have to do with there music.<br />The only thing thats a little bad about the songs is that there too short. Only 2 or 3 minutes long.(Most of the good ones)<br />The songs:<BR>1-742617000027-(:35)- 10/10-One of my favorite intros ever. <BR>2-(Sic)-(3:19)- 10/10<BR>3-Eyeless-(3:56)-10/10<BR>4-Wait and Bleed-(2:27)-10/10<BR>5-Surfacing-(3:37)-9/10<BR>6-Spit it Out-(2:39)-10/10<BR>7-Tattered and Torn-(2:53)-9/10<BR>8-Me Inside-(2:39)-10/10<BR>9-Liberate-(3:04)-9/10<BR>10-Prosthetics-(4:58)-8/10<BR>11-No Life-(2:47)-8/10<BR>12-Diluted-(3:22)-8/10<BR>13-Only One-(2:24)-8/10<BR>14-Scissors-(8:24)-10/10<BR>15-Get This-(2:03)-10/10<BR>16-Spit It Out (Hyper Version)-(2:24)-10/10<BR>17-Wait and Bleed (Terry Dat Mix)-(2:31)-10/10<BR>18-Interloper (Demo)-(2:18)-10/10<br />19-Despise (Demo)-(3:41)-9/10<BR>20-Surfacing (Live)-(3:37)-9/10<BR>*EXTRA TRACK*<BR>The extra track continues from track 20 and there are two different parts.

I read a review in a magazine in MAY of 2003 that they were going to be recording new music and that they hoped to get the new cd out in September of 2003. Never happened as I waited till October. I heard they would release it in December of 2003. Never happened. Now in May of 2004 on May 25 there new cd \\"Volume 3 The Subliminal Verses\\" will be in stores. I have heard \\"Durality\\" and that song is awesome. If you liked Joey's drumming in the last two cd's wait till you here this cd. MAY 25, 2004.
B000001EAQ|5.0|This CD is brilliant.  It is powerful, moving, and intense.  Let me tell you why.<br />  Crystal Method is a perfect example of what happens when poor musicians attempt to amalgamate two musical genres.  You get a product like, &quot;Legion of Boom,&quot; their newest cd, where Wes Borlyn is on guitar and Rahzel is doing vocals.  They wish to call it rock-techno, except that it sucks.<br />  Pop is an album for high-energy people, or nights when something big is going to happen.  Rushing downtown to hit a club or lounge on a buddy's birthday, on your way to a sick drink off, I don't know . . .<br />  This is the first CD after Larry Mullen went through his modern percussion training in New York, and boy can you tell.  While it is true that Edge and Adam became a little aggravated during this albums production, when the songs were heard by the band, all the bizarre hard electronica work of Zooropa paid off.<br />  The only weaknesses of this album are the faded vocals/ weak lyrics on the high-energy songs.  This of course does not qualify for a valid criticism, since it is only my opinion, but I felt it necessary to point out at least one thing I found wrong with the album.<br />  All in all, this CD is a wonderful mixture of styles and genres.  The down tempo songs have great depth, and the high-energy anthems are sincerely crackling with power.  If you enjoy dabbling into electronica, and are open-minded aesthetically you will enjoy this cd.

B0001US8EO|4.0|Larger than life and with twice as many brothers, \\"Wyatt Earp\\" struts onto the DVD scene in a \\"Special Edition\\" that looks stunning but is less filling than one might have expected. This sprawling episodic tale begins with Wyatt as a child preparing to run away from home and join the Union army like his brothers Virgil and James. His father (Gene Hackman in a brief but powerful performance)catches him as he leaves and returns him back home. While Wyatt clearly yearns from the adventure he feels his brothers are experiencing, his father knows the truth about war and sets him straight.<br /><br />Later, James and Virgil return home both exhausted and beat up from serving in the army. Their father has put on his traveling shoes and announces that the family will be moving West where there's opportunity for a lawyer and rich land is ready to be farmed.<br /><br />Wyatt after many trials and tribulations ends up out west as a lawman. He manages to interest his brothers in coming out to help clean up Dodge City as well. We also get the thunderous conflict at the OK Corral as part of the conclusion of the film and witness a wonderful performance by Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday. While the narrative is a bit too episodic and flawed, the film manages to retain one's interest throughout it's 190 minute running time due to Costner's unassuming portrayal as Wyatt. The real highlight, though, is Quaid as Doc capturing the fragile gunfighter as he fights the consumption that eats him alive.<br /><br />With the long wait for \\"Wyatt Earp\\" to appear on DVD, one would have hoped to have a special edition with a commentary from director Lawrence Kasdan, star Costner and a look back at the film's reception when it was first released a decade ago. Unfortunately, the Warner Special Edition sticks to the basics for the most part: we get the original 190 minute theatrical cut of the film (sans the extended scenes that were added to the video version); two documentaries one \\"new\\" one that includes vintage interviews and the other a 1994 TV special; \\"lifted scenes\\", i.e., the footage included in the special video edition and the theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Let's start with the good stuff first. The stunning anamorphic widescreen transfer finely does justice to Kasdan's epic vision for this larger than life western biography. The remastered 5.1 sound captures just about every nuance from the original theatrical exhibition 10 years ago. Honestly, \\"Wyatt Earp\\" hasn't sounded this good since it was first released in 1994.<br /><br />The negatives are few but worth noting. The documentaries are pretty good although a bit too brief. Perhaps Kasdan preferred his original theatrical cut to the extended version. That could explain why these sequences show up on the second disc and aren't integrated into the film. The lack of a commentary track is a big minus for the disc, though, as 1)Knowing how the film compared to the life of Earp would have been fascintating and 2) Kasdan's plans while shooting the film and comments would have been welcome.<br /><br />With the recent deluxe release of \\"Open Range\\", I would have hoped for better from this release. On the other hand, great care was used in transferring this for DVD and the extras are roughly what \\"Unforgiven\\" received when it was re-released. Kudos to Warner for such a marvelous looking DVD although, again, more extras should have been included.cludes vintage interviews and the other a 1994 TV special; \\"lifted scenes\\", i.e., the footage included in the special video edition and the theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Let's start with the good stuff first.

0316666343|1.0|I did not enjoy The Lovely Bones at all.  It seemed as though the theme was mixed up in dull mystery, fantasy and twisted romance.  The book was about a girl that was murdered, and went up to heaven to watch her family.  Heaven was portrayed as an unhappy and boring place in this book.  Why would it be called heaven if it was not in anyone's liking?  That is one aspect of the book that I particularly did not agree with.  Life back on earth was severely and insanely wrong.  The once loving mother of the girl that was murdered decides to have an affair while her husband does not even recognize it!   I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys singing in the rain, but if you're a teenager, like me, chances are, your opinion will be close to mine about this book.  In the beginning, the book did a slightly good job of keeping my attention, but in the middle, it all seemed to be confusing and dragged out. The ending was bittersweet, and if you don't like happy ending; then this book is a dream come true for you.   In a way, it was like a salad with no dressing,and constantly being tossed:always bouncing back and forth between ironic ideas and never really saying anything at all.  This was definitely not a rock my sox off kind of book, especially when, I have to force myself to read it just to get it done before the dead line.  Teenagers! Stay away from this book!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have to say, this is a really great album.  After listening to it a few times, I realize how high quality the songs are and how much effort was put into recording it.  It's certainly the best pop album I've listened to in a few years, probably the best since Kylie's &quot;Fever.&quot;  Elements of the album remind me of Madonna's &quot;Ray of Light,&quot; especially songs like &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; and &quot;Touch of My Hand.&quot;  Britney is definitely finding her path as an artist and she has produced her best album yet in the process.  If her next album is anything like this one, I expect her to be here for a long time to come!
B0001GF2DS|4.0|This is a classic film to watch, no matter who you are or what you're into:<BR>The Ugly<br />Ever since Quentin Tarantino announced that he was using some sort of Spaghetti Western<BR>techniques in his latest film, I decided to get interested in it. Then I saw a small clip of this movie<BR>on television and I was completely blown away. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is most definitely<BR>one of the best films ever made, alongside Gone With the Wind and Citizen Kane. The<BR>Cinematography alone is enough to make me sleep happily for forty days and forty nights. The<BR>action and death are more than enough to satisfy even the most cynical of action lovers. And the<BR>final showdown at Sad Hill is perhaps one of the most memorable sequences is cinema history,<BR>from the ecstasy of gold to the final \\"cut.\\" All around, this movie is at the top of every known<BR>ranking list.<br />However, there are one or two complaints about this new video transfer I'd like to address:<BR>The Bad<br />With the original 1998 DVD edition, the American release was sold and with a not too bad of a<BR>DVD package either. The sound is only 2-channel mono, but that didn't really seem to matter. The<BR>feature ran for 2 hours and 44 minutes, then there was a theatrical trailer and some production<BR>notes. Like I said, not a bad little package.<br />This newly remastered edition is different. On the original release there were some deleted<BR>scenes that were cut out of the American release. Most of those scenes have been added,<br />making this a full 3 hour spectacle. That's not too bad because at absolutely no point does the<BR>movie drag, but the newer scenes are horribly remade. <BR> -First off, the dubbing. Any Kung Fu movie has crappy American voice-overs, as with any<BR>Spaghetti Western, which is okay once you get used to it. However, even Clint Eastwood's and Eli<BR>Wallach's newly acquired voices for the deleted scenes are terrible. They both sound extremely<BR>old, especially Wallach. They don't really need top be that well in sync, but at least a mono<BR>soundtrack could be used instead of today's sophisticated technology.<BR> -The picture. While I'll tell you about the good parts of it later, now I'll say that there's<BR>some very annoying things about it. At one very noticeable point, there's terrible dubbing and<BR>yellow streaks flashing about for five seconds.<br />And now, the moment you've all waited for:<BR>The Good<br />Some of the picture is bad, but the rest of the digital transfer is sheer dynamite. The reds are<BR>blood red, the greens are forest green, and nothing's dark that doesn't need to be. Hardly any film<BR>scratches and most have been fixed. A beautiful 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound mix that EXPLODES<BR>off the screen. I was jumping for joy when the first bullets went off, but in all honesty the sound<BR>effects have just been re-worked to seem more life like. This film is magnificent.<br />In conclusion, this isn't the best DVD ever, but it's okay. Still, if the Alien Quadrilliogy had been<BR>considered here, whereas a Special Edition and Theatrical Release was available (or in this case<BR>Italian and American), this would've sold more copies and it would be something to be proud of.<BR>Still, I like it. I don't love it, but if you're like me just watch it a few times. It'll only get better with<BR>age.
B00000DLVA|5.0|Let there be no mistake, this is a fantastic CD. The tracks have an immediate accessability but will also linger with you long after you first hear them. 5 star performance for me. &quot;Junk of the Heart&quot; will have you grabbing the controls of your walkman to hear it again and try and recapture the feelings. Truly astounding, well balanced and just brilliant!
B0000CEB62|4.0|i agree with everything positive that the other reviewers have wrote about this DVD. it's definitely a keeper... the only thing you may want to know and that i will point out is that the second disc is obviously not the whole 101 concert. it's more like highlights of the Music for the Masses tour. first of all, not all the concert footage was from the Pasadena show. you can tell that some songs were performed in a venue that's smaller and even is indoors. for those of you who have the 101 cd, you will notice not all of the songs on the cd are on DVD disc 2. furthermore, the songs that appear on DVD disc 2 have been edited, so you don't hear or see the full versions. i'm not bashing this DVD in any way, but you should keep this in mind when purchasing.
B000051VWW|4.0|I purchased Sade's Lover's rock album back in 2000-2001. I found her album to really satify my need to relax and think about situations I was going through. Her delightful voice combined with her soulful lyrics produces a serine enviorment for any true music lover. Lover's Rock is not much different from any other album she has previously released. Her songs are based on the same topics, love and relationships which I feel to be a good thing it shows consistency. Lover's Rock has proven for me to be the best song on the album, and it's also the the title for the album.Her hit single King of sorrow also display her talent and ability to touch her audience. I plan to have this album in my cd rotation for a long time.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|There's not a lot I can add to what's already been said, and, at any rate, it's not as if anyone is going to read my review (being reviewer no. 227).  Anyway, I just wanted to say that I liked the movie because it's not mainstream - it doesn't really fit into any genre.  It was fun to watch the story unfold, not really knowing where it was going to take you.  I pondered over the movie in the days after I saw it, trying to find &quot;the message&quot;.  In the end, I decided there wasn't one, but at least it caused me to think, and to consider my own relationship with my now-deceased father.  If the movie accomplished nothing elese, that was enough.  There aren't many movies that make you think after the end credits roll, but this one did (at least for me).
0743233832|5.0|Although written almost 2000 years ago, the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius remains one of the best and most practical books ever written.  If you are seeking a guidebook to a harmonious life under any circumstances, this book is the best investment you could ever make. This is an excellent translation that is timely and fluid.  Some of these ideas make appearances in popular self-help books from time to time, but no one can match the force of the entire work.  You can read it straight through, or open to a random page for insights on a daily basis.  I'm giving a copy to my son for his 12th birthday.
B000063UR2|5.0|The Tangerine Dream score (original US) was far better and more appropriate than the pendantic Goldsmith score. TD was at their height at this time. The TD score, and the two add ons by Brian Ferry and Jon Anderson from Yes, were positive highlights from the '86 release. In the commentaries, the TD score is described almost as a rock and roll score, but this is a bad description. It was the two songs by Brian Ferry and Jon Anderson that were layed on top of the TD score at the end that were rock and roll. (And they were good, too.) The TD score itself was completely appropriate to the movie as it gave it an otherworldy feel, while still being gentle and lilting in places.    But it was nice to finally see the alternate Euro version. The extra scenes with Meg Knucklebones were a hoot. I learned from the commentaries that Meg was played by the same actor who played the hologram doctor on Star Trek Voyager.    What is not commented on was that the US theatre version had scenes that were NOT in the Euro version. Specifically, just after Gump and Jack split up from Brown Tom and Screwball in the underground lair, they have a big fight with a group of barrow wights (for lack of better term.) This fight scene is absent from the Director's Cut, but is in the Theatre version which is included in this package. That is why it's great to have both.    I am not sure which film crew person was most responsible for the overall look, and world details of the movie, but they really did a great job. This is probably the last movie made before CGI took over the world and if it were made today it would have that cartoony look that the people seem to like (but I don't.) This person should have received an oscar nomination at the least as discussed in the commentaries.    The actors and actresses portraying the little goblins and monsters and forest folk all give great performances and the world is beautifully presented (or frighteningly as the case may be.) The non-humans definetely upstage the human characters.  The Tim Curry monster was pretty scary. Tim Curry (Rocky Horror)gave the performance of his life in this film.     There are a lot of extras in this package. Fans of this rarely discussed film will be delighted by extra sequence footage, the Brian Ferry music video (again rarely seen), many commentary reels from different perspectives, and trailers. I was reminded of how different the theatre commercials were from the Tv spots. It almost seemed like a different movie that either of the releases. Well, worth the low price if you are a fan.
B000000H48|5.0|This was the first King Diamond CD I ever listened to.  It is a continuation of the story on the album, Them, which is excellent as well.  This album took me to another world of dark fantasy and gave me comfort during trying times in my life.  For that I owe King Diamond a great debt.  As a guitarist myself, I find the guitar work to be beautiful and flawless.  If you're into guitar and even if you might not like the doom and gloom imagery, this album would be great for you.  I was listening to a lot of stuff from Shrapnel Records at the time and the guitarists from King Diamond really blew that stuff away.  This album will send chills down your spine (that is if you have one!)  All metal heads need to hear this at least once.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and everything is just great, including the story, acting, and definately the music. Go see it!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Putting this albums mastery into words is almost impossible.  OK Computer comes out of the perfect almagamation of Radioheads earlier alt-guitar universe and sweeping beautiful vocals of Thomas Yorke, mixed in with chaotic electroinc fervor and psychotic art mixes.<br />There hasn't been an album up to this ones release that sounded anything close to this.  It really truly is a milestone, a unique recording in the history of music.  Putting in odd sounds and tones in recordings can be an absolute disaster.  However, OK Computer ends up sounding extremely accesible without being overly-pretentous or arty.  It's very easy to get, and the sounds coaked out of feedback, and electronic play are some of the most ingenious things I have ever heard of (The guitar sounds in Paranoid Android are unreal in terms of their sonic quality).<br />Once you hear the opening oddness of 'Airbag' with a strange guitar riff, peppered with a clean arpegiation, and then mixed with some shaking bells, you realise you are in for something you never heard before.  Almost every song sounds unique in its own right.  The same instruments (from the drums, to the keyboards, to the guitars) never even sound the same from recording to recording.  It's as if each song was to be a work of mastery.<br />The band would continue on getting more experimental (Kid A), however this is truly where the brilliance began and was perfected.  I am convinced they will never be able to duplicate the perfection of this album, and no other band will even come close.<br />It's a perfect classic album.  End of story.
B00004STPT|5.0|This is definately one of the best scores to any movie I have ever heard. It absolutely never gets old or tiring. Hans Zimmer is a real master at this, and I love this album. Go buy it, you won't regret it.
1400032717|5.0|Not many people can quite understand what goes on in the minds of the mentally impaired, all that is seen and understood is the outward culmanation of their thought process. Yet Haddon succesfully manages to portray the mind of a (fictional) autistic boy beautifully, creating sympathy and emotion for a mind that knows neither. <br />Christopher, the narrator, is a 15 year old boy, yet his writing seems simple and straight-forward, mirroring his thought-process. Although to others, an autistic mind may seem complex and non-comprehensible, Christopher's thoughts explain his actions in a simple manner, which he cannot convey to others in words. <br />When Christopher discovers his neighbour's dog dead in her garden, he decides to embark upon an investigation to determine the murderer. To Christopher, dogs are just as important as people, and so the killer must be found. But his investigations take him much further than he expects, revealing truths about both of his parents, and turning the world-as-he-knows-it upside down, completely rearranging his life. However, Christopher's reaction to the events of the novel are not as the reader experiences them. When he discovers the truth about his Mother and Father, his physical anguish is clearly shown, yet his narrative technique does not show passionate emotions or distress. His mind and thoughts remain calm and passive. Through Christopher's eyes we see normal every-day events from a different perspective, and experience normally upsetting and traumatic events through an emotionally indifferent mind, creating even more empathy and sorrow than usual. <br />The simple writing style of Christopher allows an easy reading of the novel, which has images and illustrations scattered throughout. However, Haddon allows the reader a fuller understand than Christopher's interpretation of events, by portraying full dialogues throughout the text that the reader can interpret differently to Christopher's unemotional grasp, giving the reader an upperhand of situations. This three-dimensional approach allows a contrast to Christopher's two, or one, dimensional interpretation, allowing an intimacy with Christopher's character that would not normally be permitted by an autistic person. <br />Despite the novels slightly large appearance, it is a quick read, due to the simple writing-style, but time should be taken whilst reading it in order to appreciate it fully. <br />The indifferent manner of Christopher compared to the emotionaly turbulent events that take place in the novel create a parallel that gives the reader full enjoyment of the novel, leaving a feeling of enlightment and deeper understand, and perhaps some guilt, for all autistic people. Rather than just understanding an autistic person from the actions they display, Haddon allows us to understand Christopher's actions and thoughts, which are wholly different, and in this way the reader can come to appreciate the intricacies and levels of an autistic mind, not just by face-value. Don't miss this great book! Another quick recommendation is The Losers Club by Richard Perez
B0001AP12G|5.0|In &quot;Never Let You Down&quot;, Kanye expresses a need for better music - mentioning that the stuff that's out now just doesn't really do it anymore. Thanks be to God that Kanye's CD is out - and it's incredibly refreshing. The skits are hilarious, the songs are applicable and relevant, and yes, the beats are still tight. My favorites are &quot;Never Let You Down&quot;, &quot;All Falls Down&quot;, &quot;Through the Wire&quot;, and &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;. I truly admire West's ability to still get through to this generation and still talk about his God - something that is a rarity nowadays in the hip-hop world. His rhymes have so much passion, but still have a light-hearted humor to them, and it makes this &quot;College Dropout&quot; completely irresistible.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Wow! What a movie.  We have come to expect the weird and wonderful from director Tim Burton, and with Big Fish he did not disappoint us.  Perhaps, this film is the best Burton has done to date- it is a weird and wonderful tale about a Father and Son, life and death and alienation and reconciliation.   <br />It is a story of Edward Bloom, masterfully played by both Albert Finney (as the elderly Bloom) and Ewan McGregor (as the younger Bloom).  You just never know where this movie is going, what is true or false.  Blooms son, Will (played by Billy Crudup) resents the time that his father spent away from home on business, he sees his fathers tall tales as a barrier to intimacy between father and son.  As an adult child Will comes home when he learns that he father is dying and attempts to discover the truth behind the tales, thinking that the truth will bring reconciliation and intimacy between father and son.  He believes that his fathers absence and tall tales were a ruse to hid a hidden life, perhaps even another family.  He cannot believe that a man who told such tales, and who was absent so much of the time could have loved his family the way he said he did. What he does discover is that sometimes the tale is better than the truth.  His father lived a mundane life as a salesmen, but in the midst of everyday life, touched the lives of hundreds of people. <br />I was touched by the love story that supported the plot between Bloom and his wife (played by Jessica Lange).  It was good to see Lange act in an older plot.  Nothing is sadder than watching a middle aged actor trying to play the part of a young person.  One could sense the impending loss, as Bloom lay dying, that this marriage was coming to an end and each party was trying to come to grips with the inevitable conclusion of life- death.<br />Yes, this movie deals with death, but it is a funny, engaging, touching, and both weird and wonderful.  If you are looking for an evenings entertainment, this movie is for you.
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley was way ahead of his time.  Music today can never measure up to the artistry and depth that is behind this album and many of his others.  Grace pulls you in and never lets go with his amazing songwriting and incredibly sultry voice.  Jeff Buckley will haunt you with &quot;So Real&quot; and suck you in with &quot;Hallelujah.&quot;  The later is my favorite because I could listen to it over and over and never get tired of it.  Not many CDs today can boast that accomplishment.  The intensity of Grace can be overwhelming to the less serious music fan, but it is a work of art to most.  Each song is like a journey that you hope will never end.  This album did not get its just deserves while Jeff Buckley was alive and I think it still doesn't.  There aren't many albums that will stand the test of time like Grace.  This one is hard to explain...just listen for yourself...you will never let go.
B00000IPAX|1.0|Okay, first off, I would like to say that I DID listen to the CD, and not just a hater posting an unfavorable review. Neither do I have a problem with punk, as some great bands such as Weezer and the Offspring make really great music, so don't think I'm biased against the musicians or musical style at all. After a friend lent me this CD, telling me how great it was in the process, my expectations were high and doubts low. Of course, I'd listened to many sermons about how terrible Blink 182 were, but I figured maybe that was all unjust criticism. I FIGURED WRONG! When I first popped in this CD, I was greeted with the song Dumpweed, which first presented me to the terrible vocals of Mark Hoppus, who sounds like he's whining and crying at the same time. It literally burns the ears to listen to him! Of course, Dumpweed has the same guitar riff the entire time, and not just on Dumpweed! ON EVERY SINGLE SONG, THE BEAT NEVER CHANGES! The only good thing at all about Blink 182 that I can find is that the drummer is half-decent, but its hard NOT to be able to follow along such juvenile guitar playing. I won't do a song-by-song review, as all the songs are terrible, but maybe &quot;All the Small Things&quot; would merit a 2/10, but it seriously gets annoying after the first listen. Plus, with 12 songs, this album manages to be ONLY 35:23 seconds long, a short album that only shortens the amount of money in your wallet! It also goes to show Blink 182 doesn't really TRY to make good songs, they just figure out a beat and jam to it for about 2 minutes! Also, who would ever think that this album has EXCEPTIONAL or HILARIOUS lyrics? I found the lyrics to be more like JUVENILE and ANNOYING! Adam's Song? Its just Mark Hoppus talking(Stupidly) behind the same guitar beat until the chorus, where Mark Hoppus screams like a dying hyena for 2 seconds, and then it reverts back to the same guitar beat again! If you want Adam's Song, just repeat that about 3 times and you have the entire song! But probably the worst thing about the entire album is that EVERY SINGLE SONG sounds like the other one! Other than the ok All the Small Things, all the other songs sound exactly congruent to all the others! I mean compare Adam's Song to The Party Song! Although the Party Song is a little harder, I sware that its the same Guitar riff on both songs! If you're looking at Enema of the State because you heard that Blink 182 is a great Punk band, get off this page and instead search for better Punk bands like The Offspring, Weezer, and for a golden oldies, The Clash! I guarantee if you listen to those groups, you will be listening to Great CDs, instead of sub-par crap like this. This is probably the worst CD to ever grace my stereo, and it's even worse than Metallica's St. Anger, and that's saying something! All the reviewers who gave 5 star reviews to this album have been manipulated by the idiocy of MTV, who supports this load of trash and also promotes the always-stupid Avril Lavigne,  the even-worse than Blink 182 the utterly terrible Newfound Glory, and the pop-(crap)punk disgrace of Good Charlotte! I won't even mention the All American Rejects(I just did though) because I'm sure that nobody would even listen to that crap!Although I respect my other reviewers opinions, I don't seriously think that they really know the Genre of Punk or are simply to juvenile to notice this CD's crappiness! To misquote the equally terrible J. L(H)O, &quot;Don't be fooled by the 5 star reviews this CD got, It still sucks a whole lot!&quot;<br />NOT RECOMMENDED, DO NOT BUY, IF THIS REVIEW WAS HELPFUL TO YOU PLEASE REMEMBER TO CLICK THE HELPFUL BUTTON!

B0000AXE8I|5.0|Contrary to popular opinion, I found this version better than the 1st part, better sci fi really.  What is so good about this film is that a lot is added, but not too much:  you get intimations of deeper things that can stimulate the imagination without laying it all out, which would stretch credibility too far.  I love the way the references are somewhat obscure and cryptic.  The actions scenes are also extremely good, while different from the 1st one.  And the acting, well, even Keanu Reeves - who is my book is a 2nd-rater - is excellent.  Taken together, this is the best sci-fi film I have seen in years.
1577311523|2.0|This is an important book, because it scoops the cream of the crop of present spiritual insights. But Tolle sounds too much like 'Mr Logic', as he describes spiritual insights in such a clinical and detached manner, he seems to miss the essence of what it means to be human in the first place. At times, it's like reading a book by Bicentennial Man.<br />Tolle might have sat on his park bench too long, and theorised about how spirituality should idealistically be adopted in the real world, whilst not really engaging with the real world enough. (Okay, so from the an &quot;enlightened&quot; point of view, this ISN'T the &quot;real world&quot;, but come on, let's get with it. Let start ENJOYING the drama!)<br />The chapter on enlightened relationships just made me cringe. But it's good fodder overall, and we know that Tolle has his ladder against the right wall. From a certain point of view, I thought that Tolle's writing was somewhat immature. There's plenty of room for growth, however, which is Good News. Organised religion is the way forward. This Buddhist stuff is getting boring. COME JC, COME!!!

0066620996|5.0|I have read various books on management, but no book is like this one. This book uses 5 years worth of detailed research, principally using FACTS, to prove what works and what does not work in managing a company and taking it from a mediocre organization to a great corporation. The book splits up all the elements required to become a great that can be summarized in three segments - disciplined people, disciplined thought and disciplined action. All the lessons learned in this book can be applied to ALL aspects of life, not just business. After reading this book, you will also realize what it takes from having a good life to living a great one.

0451191153|4.0|The Fountainhead chronicles (in third person) the saga of brilliant architect Howard Roark, the society that hates him and his violent romance with stunningly beautiful Dominique Francon.  It's a wonderful story brought down only because Rand wrote this book only to prove her philosophy of Objectivism; therefore her characters aren't three dimensional at all, and the dialogue is rather rigid.  It is also a tad unrealistic when characters rant for several pages about something. The storytelling also exhibits a heavy bias towards Roark and those who are his allies. The story is excellent though, filled with page-turners and bursting with excellent descriptions and thought sequences. I do not agree with all of Rand's philosophy however, shunning altruism, and spirituality of any kind. <BR>Included in the society that is against him, is the wildly adored, but greedy, power-hungry newspaper columnist, Ellsworth Toohey. He believes in collectivism, where everything is simplified and watered down to the masses. I like how Ellsworth doesn't reveal that he is truly evil till the end of the book. Another one of the foes, although not seen until later into the novel, is Gail Wynand, the owner of a popular, newspaper that runs shallow stories about things such as poor pregnant young women.  Peter Keating, Roark's rival since college, is widely adored, and experiences a quick rise to fame as opposed to Roark's sluggish one. However, he has no real talent as an architect, and is written as a sort of worm in the story. <BR>Dominique Francon is a socialite with a frivolous newspaper column. She is exquisitely beautiful, but she is very icy until she meets Roark. Then she becomes more proactive in the novel. She has a rather pessimistic view of society, and surrounds herself with things she hates so that she cannot witness society tearing apart the things she loves. She and Roark have a violent, psychological love affair lasting throughout the entire book and are thus smiled upon byRand. Their relationship is in direct contrast to Keating's cutesy and insipid romance with his college sweetheart Katie. <BR>Rand's novel, although extremely one-sided, is an excellent read, a true contemporary classic, and very thought provoking.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|I am a region4 customer so have not reviewed the revised DISNEY version on DVD but am reviewing the original versions for your information/comparison.<BR>The original English version was masterful. While no expert on the director's work or ANIME I have a broad knowledge of film/animation. The story is for romantic adults but is also safe and entertaining for children. It is fanciful in that the central character is under a spell/curse (he has not suffered a tragic accident) but aside from this the story is set in a semi-real world unlike films such as 'Spirited Away'. It is a story of complex, adult friendships and love. It has an air of 'Casablanca' to it.<BR>The animation is beautiful, and is a treat for aviation buffs dreaming of the barnstorming days. <BR>The original music score is good and sets the right 'atmosphere' for the film.<br />I hope the re-working has not removed the soul of this excellant film, and I do not understand why it was even done.
0140177396|5.0|&amp;#65279;Overall, John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is really a good book. Even though it's rather short, it<BR>delivers its message quite well. The book opens with George and Lennie near the Salinas River<BR>south of Soledad, California. Lennie is a big, loveable guy who isn't very smart, but is easily<BR>pleased. Lennie loves to stroke soft things, and has a mouse in his hands that he accidentally<BR>killed by petting it too hard. Lennie's portrayal is extremely sympathetic and sentimental, but I<br />couldn't help but like him, regardless of his flaws. George is the little man behind Lennie; he acts<BR>as the big man's brain in guiding him and keeping him out of trouble. We all has someone like<BR>George to keep us out trouble from time to time.  The two travel and work together and have a<BR>friendship unlike anything most other characters in the novel have ever experienced. The book<BR>really got me to feel like I knew the characters, especially Lennie, and you begin to feel like your<BR>in the story with the characters. The underlying theme of man's innate loneliness and his need for<BR>companionship is a bit dark and pessimistic for my taste, but is delivered tactfully with the<BR>repeated story of George and Lennie's farm where Lennie will be able to tend rabbits while the<BR>two live off the fatta the lan' offers hope so the book can be easily stomached by someone with a<BR>more optimistic worldview.  I do have to say this is one of the best book I have read.  All things<BR>considered, I would definitely recommend this book for everyone to read; the ideas behind it<BR>should be considered by all.
B00019PDKC|5.0|This album is amazing. It is a natural progression for a wonderful band that does not get the recognition that they deserve. I've been listening to Anathema for about 8 years now and every album has been an amazing. Their sound is very unique, putting you in a musical melancholic trance. This album is so much different than their very early work (Serenades,Pentecost III), yet the &quot;Anathema&quot; sound is still there. My personal favorites are Are You There?, A Natural Disaster, Flying, Electricity, and Violence. If you like this album, please check out Eternity, Judgement, Alternative 4, and A Fine Day To Exit. If you are a music lover, and appreciate the darker side of human emotion, then there is no way you will dislike Anathema.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Not an oscar winner, but this one has cult potential. Just enough fantasy in the real world to keep you entertained, and light humor to round off the edges.

B0000DD7LB|3.0|I have never been a fan of Miss. Spears. However, when I first heard Toxic I was hesitate to admit I like a Britney song. The first song with Madonna was a marketing techique after her lesbian kiss with the ol' crow, plus it sucked! Overall, I feel she is nothing except eye candy, and a money making machine for her record label, and her parents. I heard the controversy concerning &quot;Everytime&quot;, the video is interesting, the lyrics are a cry out for help, and to Justin. I just hope she is done with her career soon... I am a little tired of her antics, flashy attire at every Hollywood/Music Award show gala.
0452282152|5.0|Girl with a Pearl Earring is a beautiful tale of a long time ago.  This story is realistic and heart driven.  Griet, the 17 year old girl who becomes a maid to help support her family, is the focal point of the story and of a painting by her master which causes all kinds of trouble.  She works in the house of a famous painter whom she is in love with.  Life is not as easy as it would seem when one is a maid and in love with their master.  This story is a fast read with details that create a world based in 1664.  I would strongly recommend it!
0634022296|4.0|This book advanced my piano and guitar playing more than several years of lessons; it essentially taught me how to play by chords vs. sight reading.  I do, however, recommend a few improvements:<br />1) Eleven songs appear out-of-order [check out the Amazon pages above].  Here's a list:<BR>Dear Prudence (off by 4 pages)<BR>Golden Slumbers (off by a whopping 36 pages)<BR>I Am the Walrus (off by 14 pages)<BR>I've Got a Feeling (off by 24 pages)<BR>Long, Long, Long (off by 12 pages)<BR>Maxwell's Silver Hammer (off by 4 pages)<BR>Old Brown Shoe (off by 24 pages)<BR>Rain (off by 3 pages)<BR>Sun King (off by 14 pages)<BR>The End (off by 2 pages)<BR>You'll Be Mine (off by 8 pages)<br />[Perhaps the songs should have been listed in order by album/recording date?]<br />2) The binding is poor, and cannot be used on a music stand.<br />3) The key transposition (on songs where the capo is recommended) is a bummer... to play the songs without a capo requires a re-transposition [not too easy to do on-the-fly].
B00005JM1F|4.0|The boys that brought us \\"Road Trip\\" are back again with \\"Old School\\" and it's pretty much what you'd think it would be.<br />THE STORY:<br />Mitch (Luke Wilson), Frank (Will Ferrell) and Beanie (Vince Vaughn) are a bunch of 30-something guys who decide to open up a frat house near their old college campus and pretty much get into all the cliché frat things to some pretty hilarious results.  Among other things they let in just about EVERYBODY (including an old homeless Vet) into the frat and they take on the crooked college Dean who holds a grudge against them from their old college days.<br />THE COOL THINGS:<br />Overall, the film is what you'd expect.  It's a \\"dumb\\" comedy and the boys get themselves into some pretty hilarious fixes.  Nothing sophisticated here which is good.  We've got streaking, we've got the sophomoric humor and that's about it.<br />THE NOT-SO-COOL THINGS:<br />Well, given that it's a \\"dumb\\" comedy as you'd expect, some things are pretty funny and then again, some things aren't all that funny.<br />BEST SCENES:<br />1. The BJ School<br />2. The Tranquilizer Dart<br />3. The \\"Exam\\" Scene<br />4. The KY Wrestling scene<br />THE DVD EXTRAS:<br />As standard for these new DVDs, you've got a truckload of extras.  Like the film itself, some of them are hilarious and some of them aren't.<br />1. \\"From the Cutting Room Floor\\" - 8 deleted scenes<br />2. \\"Old School Orientation\\" - 13 minute film synopsis featurette<br />3. \\"Inside the Actors Studio Spoof\\" - 21 minute spoof of a \\"serious\\" talk show segment with the main cast and directors, complete with overly dramatic host and canned audience reactions.  It got old after like 4 minutes...<br />4. \\"Outtakes &amp; Bloopers\\" - 5 minute montage<br />5. Commentary Track<br />6. 3 TV Spots &amp; 1 Trailer from the films promotion<br />7. Sneak Peaks:  Trailers for \\"Biker Boyz,\\" \\"The Fast and the Furious Tricked Out Edition,\\" and \\"Head of State\\"<br />8. Photo Gallery<br />9. Cast Bios<br />10. Filmmaker Bios<br />11. Production Notes<br />THE VERDICT:<br />Well, for a \\"dumb\\" comedy this is definitely one of the better ones.  It was waaay better than \\"Road Trip\\" but as with stuff in this genre it's just okay.  You'll get a good laugh and you'll also shake your head a few times too.  Overall, not bad for a weekend rental and if you loved the movie the extras justify this as a pretty good addition to your collection if you're so inclined.<br />GRADES:<br />The Movie:  3 ½ stars<BR>The Extras:  5 stars<BR>Overall:  4 ¼ stars<br />Recommended if you need a mindless laugh
0441003257|5.0|You don't need to be a fantasy or science fiction nut to love this book, just someone who appreciates a dry and twisted sense of humor.  I would never have been interested in this book based on the description, but I'm so glad I gave it a try, because this is hands-down the funniest book I've ever picked up in my life!  The jokes aren't slapstick-in-your-face; they're quick and inconspicuous, which makes them even funnier.  Don't read this book in a library or on the bus; people will wonder why you keep bursting out laughing uncontrollably.  For instance, picture a servant of Satan, threatening his plants to keep them alive.  Or the biblical Famine running a fast food chain.<br />I *will* warn that anyone who is offended by, let's says, &quot;creative&quot; interpretations of biblical events may not enjoy this book.  If the idea of, say, an angel of Heaven uttering the &quot;F&quot; word under dire circumstances isn't your cup of tea, or the idea of Satan speaking through a Freddie Mercury tape upsets you, then you probably won't enjoy this book.  Otherwise, settle into a comfy chair and get ready to laugh until you can't breathe!
0786860707|2.0|I realize I'm alone on this one, so I don't think my voice will be heard very well against the crowds saying otherwise, but I didn't find this book to be very useful.  I was so excited when I first got it because I've heard nothing but good things about it, but I was unfortunately dissappointed.  It's really more of a history and recollection of &quot;the good ol' days&quot; told by two brilliant animators, but, in my honest opinion, it lacked very much the &quot;how to&quot; part of animation.  I'm all for learning from the experiences of others, but after reading the book cover to cover I can't say I'll be a better animator for it.
B00006V9A0|3.0|Well looking at this album, gotta say its solid up and down. But this could have been (and still could be) the biggest selling album of all time. Considering this project started with Krist Novaselic and Dave Grohl, coming up with a project called &quot;Heart Shaped Box&quot; (Which every bootlegger has stolen)The orginial premice of the project consisted of 4 cd's the first which would be this album minus &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; the second and third disks consisting of all the unreleased b-sides and recordings stored away, the 4th being yet another live album consisting of nothing from the &quot;Wishka&quot; live set. Rumor had it that most of the &quot;Roma Concert&quot; which by most accounts, and the bootleg version (Which every hardcore Nirvana fan must own) could have been the best performance by Nirvana. Yes, indeed this could have been killer, that was untill Ms. Love's unfortunate interference. So to sum up this album yes it is a must own if not for nothing else but &quot;You Know Your Right&quot; but as for me I Cannot wait for the day when all Nirvana fans get their just do. Personal Note: Ms. Love please let the fans have the music Kurt wanted us to have PLEASE!!!!
B00006L83N|2.0|I really dont get why everybody gives 5 stars!!!<br />COME ON!<br />They are great musicians but this album is definitively weak<br />There are some &quot;good&quot; songs like: wicked, king of terrors, turning. But that's all<br />Go get the newmythology (v) or dwot<BR>they're much, much better!<br />Dont be bootlickers<br />Dream Theater's Train of Though is far better!<br />Remember that Petrucci is the 27th whereas romeo is the 91th regarding to &quot;the 100 best guitarrist players over the world&quot;.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I just wrote a review but after reading some more of everyone else's comments I feel I need to tack on a footnote. Quentin Tarantino is not trying to teach everyone a moral lesson.  All these people giving Kill Bill one star are just missing the point.  So many other movies conform to these ridiculous moral standards that are ultimately meaningless anyway.  Would I be a better person if at the end of Kill Bill Uma Thurman's character realizes that violence is wrong?  Of course not!  For Tarantino, cinema provides the opportunity for us to live out these outlandish fantasies that we could never confront in real life.  Everything about this movie is hard-core, because Tarantino refuses to compromise anything, and that's why it is so good.  For proof of how ignorant people are who don't like this movie, just read some of their reviews carefully.  One is signed by a husband and wife, but it is clearly only the husband speaking, as he speaks in the singular.  Another rambles incoherently using as many obscure words as possible, while another desperately tries to sound like an intellectual, using pretentious words like &quot;whilst&quot;.  Come on, watch this movie with an open mind, violence is a part of our culture already, so just accept it and enjoy.
B000002UAU|1.0|This album must really be the one most overrated album of all time by - surprise - the one most overrated band ever to walk the earth.  This is from the period in The Beatles' careers where they could get away with murder ... in this case, murdering music. I never liked their vocals to start with. Even the huge amounts of reverb in this album can't cover up the fact that the guys could not freaking sing. McCartney had always sounded like someone squeezed his private parts while he was doing a vocal effort, but on this album his singing sounds more strained than ever. Lennon's voice was only matched by his songwriting: bland, obnoxious and highly LSD-induced. And what the heck was George  thinking while fiddling on that sitar?? He couldn't play the instrument a dime's worth. Come to think of it, he didn't have much going for him on guitar either. <br />The only Beatle I really rspected was Ringo Starr. At least he had some insight in his own lack of talent, which sometimes led to pretty amusing songwriting efforts. The Beatles are the one example of how much you can achieve on marketing hype alone. &quot;Artists&quot; like Madonna, Prince and George Michael are now following their example. Hooray.
B00005JMEW|5.0|If you read these reviews, you'll discover that there are two different reactions one may have to this movie.  If one is open-minded, intelligent, and doesn't take oneself too seriously, one will realize that Kill Bill (parts 1 and 2 together) ranks as one of the greatest and most entertaining movies ever made.  Every sequence impresses the viewer with its high level of craftsmanship, proving once again that Quentin Tarantino is <BR>easily one of our greatest and most original living directors.  There is nothing cheap about this movie, as Tarantino has constructed a rich world where his characters' actions may resonate like those of the characters of Greek Tragedy.  It must be said, Kill Bill is a masterpiece, and I wish I had time to ramble on about it all day.  Nonetheless, I will say that (with the possible exception of the occasionally over-indulgent dialogue in Part II) the film is absolutely flawless, and I would recommend it strongly to any person who can handle it.  Of course, maybe, if you are overly sensitive, greatly disturbed by cinematic violence, or simply afraid to immerse yourself in an exemplary modern fulfillment of Wagner's ideal of gesamtkunstwerk (total artwork), I suppose that possibly, perhaps, this movie is not for you, although to tell you the truth its probably worth seeing anyway just on the rare chance you'll enjoy it, because if you do, you will GREATLY enjoy it.  SEE KILL BILL!<br />(PS - don't listen to those one star people, they're stupid and annoying.  who the hell lives in &quot;Powderly&quot; Kentuckey anyway?)
B0000025OP|3.0|It's true that this does not compare to Dylan's greater works like Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks, and Highway 61 Revisted, but this album is still worth listening to. The lyrics are not Dylan's best, but the music, provided by The Band, and Dylan's voice allow one to enjoy this overlooked Dylan album. The song &quot;Hazel&quot; in particular is an unknown Dylan classic. If you love Dylan or The Band, I say definitely pick this one up.
B00004TDTO|5.0|This movie scared the crap out of me.  When I go to are bech house I only go in water about half a foot deep.  A shark is chompy the people.  This movie was the second series of man eater.  Better than the  classic 1960 horror movie that inspires   this genre of monstres.  <br />Quint is herilious he made me laugh.  This movie has some comedy as well.  When quite said what you got her portable monkey cage.  Anti shark.    It very good movie.  It had three sequels of which two I own.  I did not buy the last one because it was alwfull bad plot and low death count.<br />My advice  If you like this sea  2 and 3 but don't waste your time with the fourth on.  Yes there is a movie call Jaws 5 Cruel Jaws but its not avilable her.  It was sent over sea because it was made illegally.
B00005MAM2|1.0|Touted as the greatest anime ever produced my friend and I who are huge anime fans rented this POC (piece of crap)....... Mediocre animation, lousy story.... the best part was close to the beginning when the fat kid gets punched in the mouth and pukes up a bunch of blood..... THAT'S it! Worst Anime I've ever seen!
B000002H97|4.0|Yeah, it's a sellout album. Who cares? I would, except for the fact that beneath the &quot;yeah, yeah, yeahs&quot; and &quot;hey, hey, heys&quot;, there is some considerable songwriting skills used and, can I say that Unforgiven is one of Metallica's greatest achievements, not because of the guitarwork; it's not technical. Not because of the ratings; there were none, but because of the feel of it, the lyrics, the power, the pain, the slow-and-simple epic and beautiful riffs..... Enter Sandman is great, but gets old after a while. Kicks when played live though. Simpler song structures, no technicality, no speed, but some good catchy tunes, that stick in your head for days.<BR>Even though the songs are mostly all good, some are too commercial and they just get old very quickly becasue of the lack of technicality.<br />Everything changed with this release, I don't know why they sold out because they were huge in the first place and would have been twice as popular then this ever made them had they releases a few more albums likewise to Master of Puppets and ....And Justice For All. A good buy, worthy of many a collection, but not essential.
B00006690G|5.0|This album is really,really,really good!! you have to listen to it a few times to really apreciate it though LOL ;) you can buy them at a music store for 20$..i bought mine for 14..definetly worth 20 though!!
B00005BL2A|4.0|If depeche mode ever would do a greatest hits collection with let's say twenty songs they would get at least<BR>three of them from this one.I'm talking about &quot;When the body speaks&quot;, <BR>&quot;Dream on&quot;, freelove and maybe another one. <BR>&quot;When the body speaks&quot; is one of the most beutiful songs ever made, with a real sence of nearness to it with the heartbeat like drum pattern.&quot;Dream on&quot; is a worthy little brother to &quot;Enjoy the silence&quot; and &quot;freelove&quot; have only one downside to it, the incredebly chessy lyrics - &quot;No hide and catsh no strings attached just freelove&quot; But overall a great song. <BR>Overall this album has a strange mix in it's sound between the atmosfaric &quot;I am you&quot; and the country felling in&quot;Breathe&quot;. That's not really a big problem but they don't really get it 100% together in this final mix in blending the songs up with one and other. My overall impression of this one is, great songs but not used to their full potentiall. Looking forward to what i've heard's gonna be the bands final album this year.../A
0446530891|2.0|I like David Baldacci. I think he's an excellent writer. He has a rare gift where his writing spans subject matters and crosses genres yet he still comes off as an expert in that particular field. He writes about lawyers, single mothers, FBI agents and many other topics with authority. Now he takes on the world of the secret service agent. Unfortunately this time he strikes out.  <br />Sean King was a secret service agent until a momentary distraction cost the life of his charge. Michele Maxwell is a current agent, but maybe not for long now that her charge was kidnapped do mostly to a single mistake. So now, of course, the two disgraced agents hook up, to the dismay of the Service, local cops, the FBI and just about everybody else. Together the try to solve the disappearance of the Presidential candidate that Michele was charge to look after while also shedding new light on the circumstances behind Sean's disgrace. Hey everyone, it's a mystery.<br />There are so many things that I didn't like about this story. First off, the plot was so complex it was unbelievable and bordering on ridiculous. The &quot;bad guys&quot; motives were very weak. The characters shallow and the tensions created by bureaucratic politics predictable and so over used in today's mystery fiction. The story moved a long at a decent place to the predictable mystery style reveal followed by the bang-bang climatic finish which was anything but climatic.<br />One of the gimmicks that is used in this story is the mystery bad guy following the good guys and commenting on their doings. Here we see an old man identified only by his make of car watching over the shoulder of our hero's. This is supposed to give us the master manipulator, on top of everything feel of our mastermind bad guys, but it comes off as cheesy.<br />I think I may be being a bit overly harsh in my review of this book. It was not utter garbage.  It's just when you expect so much out of an author based on his history, you tend to judge his failures harsher.
B000002MJC|5.0|A lot of bands does this kind of album, ten years on, the momentum build up and a solid fan base a lot of bands change direction in their music, 9/10 fail to keep their fan base and even more fail to keep their musical integrity. However this is most definently not the case with this album, this album got soul! (Not that their others lack of it but...) I've been to a lot of conserts but i have never seen a song that really hypnotized me as much as &quot;i feel you&quot; does, i'm not saying that it's the greatest song on earth but on of them.      Comdemnation is the song however that really captures the soul of the band, and the best vocals ever layed down by gahan, it's ridicuelesly good! And the adrenalin of &quot;rush&quot;, the dramatic &quot;one caress&quot;, In your room and so on... This album is one of the few that i really would recommed everyone to feel, because this is a album with soul that you dont just hear, you feel it deep down.
0345308239|4.0|It has been said that history doesn't repeat itself but it does rhyme. This is the theme of this book: a survey of folly throughout history. Tuchman provides historical analysis that reads flawlessly and is nonpartisan. Her command of history is striking. Her three main examples from history are the British Lose America, The Rennaisance Popes Provoke the Protestant Reformation and America in Vietnam. Each section is well written and historically complete. She provides background in each section that helps to understand how governments and individual personalities contribute to the pursuit of folly.<br />I found the book quite informative and her arguments convincing. The sections on British lose America and American in Vietnam provide spectacular insight into America's current policy in the Middle East. The only downside to the book is that she concentrates on just her main examples. The scope of her analysis is not wide and leaves out countless other examples of folly in hisotry.
B00005JLH3|4.0|&quot;Drumline&quot; is a surprisingly good film about music, or beat.  At first, you may dislike its almost military-like discipline shown in the story, but the music and drama will gradually win you over, with the great showdown about &quot;the battle of drumlines&quot; which is a minor classic.<br />New star Nick Cannon is Devon, New-York born freshman in the University in Atlanta.  He is a skilled drummer (of snare drum), recruited to make it as a musician there, and possibly win the love of a girl Laila (Zoe Saldana).  Well, that was his idea.<br />However, to his dismay, the &quot;band&quot; of the university turns out something different.  It is, though within the reasonable rules, something like army, where you have to wake up at 4 am.; where you have to train your bodies even in the hard rain; or -- this is the most important part -- the ego clashes between him and one senior member Sean, who thinks this able rookie can be the threat to his role.<br />The film's greatest merit is its beat, most eloquently shown in the final scene -- the national contest for the band.  In it, you experience the thrill and excitement of the marching band's incredibly rousing beat, which would justify the film's overlong and a little predictable story.  In other words, once you see it, the &quot;half-time&quot; itself becomes the sports.<br />The school drama is not particularly great, but reasonably presented, without relying on cliched storytelling.  Besides Zoe Saldana (&quot;Crossroads&quot;), you will see GQ, Leonard Roberts as Sean, Jason Weaver, and Orlando Jones as the coach, whose quiet but assured manners as teacher add the convincing touch to the film.<br />Like &quot;Bring it on,&quot; &quot;Drumline&quot; will change the image and definition of marching band.  It takes what it describes seriously, and rightly so.  And it finally pays off.
B000255LIY|4.0|The Lion in Winter is my favorite play. The original movie with Katherine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole is my second favorite movie. But this version with Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart is a very good remake. The script is almost exactly the same as the play and original movie, but the little extra flourishes and scenes makes it a special rendition. Fine acting from the main two actors, Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart, as usual. She is one of the finest American Actresses ever, and Mr. Stewart is capable of excellent performances in any acting medium. John Light (Geoffrey) was just as good as John Castle in the original if not better. The subtle nuances of his plotting mannerisms was delicious to watch. Andrew Howard (Richard) was better than Anthony Hopkins (who was great in the original but not as polished as his later work). Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Phillip) was adequate but I felt that Timothy Dalton was magnificent. My only displeasure in this version was Rafe Spall (John)and Julia Vsotsky (Alais). He was a foppish idiot of the first order and her acting was not mature enough. Nigel Terry was a very good John as well as Jane Merrow as Alais.  The scenery was dated very well to the time frame. I believe that it was filmed within Hungary. Anyone who views this movie would enjoy it but if they are familiar with the original movie, please keep in mind that both movies are based on a play.
6300214435|5.0|&quot;Oh *h*t.&quot; - Indiana Jones is deep in it when he discovers he is trapped on a rope bridge, courtesy of Thugee soldiers, that leads to freedom in &quot;Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom&quot;.<br />Steven Spielberg's first prequel, the blockbuster &quot;Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom&quot; is a rollercoaster ride that, after 20 years (and one day), is still effective long after its 5/23/84 release.<br />Taking place a year before the events in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, Indiana Jones, with the help of his sidekick Short Round and lounge singer Willie Scott, does battle with a strong religous cult, known as the Thugee, trying to retrieve a sacred stone (called The Sankara Stone that is one of four stones, &amp; if combined could make the Thugee all powerful) for a battered, decaying village. Along the way, Indy also frees the village's children that the cult has kidnapped (the kids are used for slave labor to dig for the missing fourth stone).<br />Much darker than &quot;Raiders&quot; (and is the dark heart of the trilogy), &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; doesn't let up until the last frame fadeout. The opening is a classic, with the Cole Porter song &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, with &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; then taking a nose dive into its first big action sequence - an allout chaotic nightclub brawl that has Indiana searching for the antidote vial to the poison he drank while fighting off anything that gets in his way, including cigarette girls. The viewer also gets a crash course in avation (not a good one though, since Indy crashes the plane), a lesson on how to be more specific when ordering soup in a foreign country (just ask for broth, no eyeballs &amp; also stick to munching on fruit), the correct way in waking someone up &quot;from the black sleep of the Kali&quot; (make sure to have a torch and lighter fluid handy), and Dr. Jones demonstrates the correct way on cutting a rope bridge (make sure to hang on...tight).<br />The film's production did have its problems.<br />Kate Capshaw didn't read the entire script before she got the part and was scared stiff to find out that some of her co-stars were going to be snakes and bugs. The scene where Willie falls off her elephant was cut short to her whining that she could lose her voice. In the original treatment of the script, Willie was to be surrounded in the mudpuddle with a bunch of snakes. Since Capshaw is deathly afraid of snakes (the day production was set to shoot the scene she was pale as a ghost and shaking) Spielberg opted to cut the scene from the film in exchange for the python, elephant trunk scene instead.<br />Harrison Ford had a severe herniated back problem after filming the fight between Indiana Jones and the Thugee Guard (the guard winds up getting hung up in the ceiling fan) in Indiana's quarters (the backflip while the guard is choking Ford is what caused the back problem). With Ford being out for 5 weeks, Jack Dearlove, Harrison Ford's stuntdouble, can be seen in all the long, tracking shots in the fight scene that leads up to the mine car chase (that includes the fight between Indiana and the huge Thugee Guard on the rock crusher). Ford and Spielberg did all the close up shots six weeks after shooting concluded on that particular sequence.<br />The film caused major controversy over the violent content in the film (an impaling, a hanging, and a heart sacrifice are heavy stuff for the PG going crowd). Spielberg went to Jack Valentii, the head of the Motion Picture Association of America, and asked if there could be a middle ground between PG and R ratings. By the end of the summer of 1984, and with the release of the Patrick Swayze film &quot;Red Dawn&quot;, the PG-13 rating was born.<br />I watched the film last night (the first time in a long time &amp; to celebrate its 20th anniversary) and I still say that &quot;Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom&quot; is decent enough entertainment and belongs in any video library (preferably DVD).y (preferably DVD).
B000003TA4|5.0|This is truly an awesome album.  Out of the greatest albums of all time I think that Nevermind should be in the top 5 or even top 3.  There is not one track on this cd that is bad or even ok.  They are all great.  Everyone already knows the songs but if for some strange reason you don't then here are the tracks:<br />1. Smells Like Teen Spirit-  Everyone should know this song since it was one of the most popular songs when Nevermind came out.  It it's a really cool song.<br />2. In Bloom- This song starts with the coolest guitar part.  It's so simple but it sounds great.  The chorus sounds really good.  <br />3. Come As You Are- Mostly everyone knows all or most of the songs on the cd.  I have nothing else to say but amazing song.<br />4. Breed- The lyrics are very odd and cool.  &quot;We could plant a house, We could build a tree&quot;.<br />5. Lithium- Kurt is a lyrical genious.  Nothing left to say.<br />6. Polly- The first unplugged song on this cd.  All Nirvana songs that are played acoustic sound great.<br />7. Territorial Pissings- They played this song on SNL so people probably know this one also.<br />8. Drain You- This song, in my opinion, is the greatest song Kurt Cobain wrote. The words are incredible. &quot;Chew your meat for you.  Pass it back and forth. In a passionate kiss. From my mouth to yours. I Like You&quot;  In a way its like a cool love song with a guitar, bass, and drums in the background.<br />9. Lounge Act- Maybe Kurt's second or third greatest song, once again, only in my opinion. &quot;Truth covered in security. I can't let you smother me&quot;.  It is just a phenomenal song.<br />10. Stay Away- This is most likely the least popular song on the album but it is still a spectacular song. It is definately worth listening to.<br />11. On A Plain- This is a pretty good song.  He played it at the unplugged performance and it sounded just as good as it does with an electric guitar.<br />12. Something In The Way- This is the slowest song I haveever heard but it is fantastic.  It is about the time when he lived under a bridge, although he probably never actually did. This song is a genious.
630157401X|5.0|\\"The quest for the grail is not Archeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the Earth.\\"<br />- Henry Jones Sr. reminds his whip wielding son how important the last crusade for the Cup of Christ is in \\"Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade\\".<br />The third entry in the adventures of Indiana Jones, aptly titled \\"Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade\\", is a lot light hearted than \\"The Temple of Doom\\" and its dark heart, and is more in the spirit of \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" but can't outmatch it.<br />Three years after the events in \\"Raiders\\", Indiana Jones is on a quest to find his missing father after finding out he's been abducted by sinister forces. For most of his life, Indiana's father, has been researching and trying to locate The Holy Grail. If Indiana finds his dad he also may have found The Holy Grail.<br />After Seventeen summers, since its 5/24/89 release, the film is still fun to watch. The cast is great, especially Sean Connery as Henry Jones Sr. I can't imagine anyone else for the role. The chemistry between Connery and Harrison Ford is what makes the \\"Last Crusade\\" a stand-out crowd pleaser. Denholm Elliot expands on his role from \\"Raiders\\" as Marcus Brody, adding some goofy comic relief as the bookish curator out of his element. Of course it isn't an \\"Indiana Jones\\" film without Harrison Ford as the title role. This a classic example of a film character that is so legendary, that it would be fruitlessly idiotic to have the character be recast with another actor. In other words I really can't see Tom Selleck as Dr. Jones, and if there isn't a fourth adventure with Indiana Jones it would suck big time, but I could live with it.<br />\\"Last Crusade\\" does have some really great action sequences. From Indy's first adventure, to the motorcycle and tank chases the film seems to try to outdo itself. Thats where the film hits a small speed bump. The action is so great that I couldn't help but be reminded of \\"Raiders\\" thru some of the action sequences in \\"Last Crusade\\" (especially the tank chase.

6302878527|4.0|When Mark and Joanna Wallace see a pair of newlyweds in a car, amid a throng of rice-flinging well-wishers, the following exchange is heard.<br />Joanna:  They don't look very happy.<br />Mark:  Why should they?  They just got married.<br />It's clear that the Wallaces' marriage has seen better days from that cynical observation.  Joanna is sick of seeing her successful architect husband at the beck and call of a certain Maurice, her husband's jaded indifference and extramarital affairs.  That leads to an introspective look at their past, given by a series of questions is posed.  Where did it all go wrong?  You haven't been happy since the day we met, have you?  Why do we keep on with this farce?  Is it worth it?  And of course, how long is this going to go on?  These also seem to reflect Hepburn's own marriage to Mel Ferrer, which would last for one more year.<br />The series of flashbacks, told non-linearly, takes the viewer seeing how Mark and Joanna first met, their travels with another married couple, and the time when they had their first child, when Mark's preoccupation in his career rather than his family reveals the first cracks appearing in their marriage.  And the film's running gag involves Mark unable to find his passport, because Joanna has taken it from him.  This comes into play as the one consistent thing in their relationship, and a reminder of the past.<br />By far, the days when Max and Joanna hitchhike across France are the happiest.  Sure, they are on a strict budget, being rained on, and a temperamental MG auto, which has a destructive sendoff when it finally poops out.  But they were like a couple of kids without a care in the world, having fun.  &quot;What kind of people eat without saying a word to each other?&quot;  The answer is married people, they say during their romantic period.  Years later, when their marriage is on the rocks, they make the same observation, only this time it's about themselves.<br />David, Joanna's extramarital lover, puts perspective on things when he tells her &quot;there comes a time when one must grow, when the old things aren't amusing anymore.&quot;  So what does one do when the old things include marriage or being together?  Does one stick it out and become more miserable and self-denying, or does one call it a day?  What's clear is that promises of never disappointing one another, that the marriage will be one of heaven, and the magic disappears once things don't become personal anymore, but driven by something else.<br />The transitions between the different times can be differentiated in the car driven, Joanna's hairstyle, dress, and how happy Mark and Joanna are.  Donen's sudden jump cuts from present to the various pasts are effective and creative.<br />Audrey Hepburn is wonderful as usual, and there's growth in the kind of character she plays.  Joanna is a variation of Anna (Roman Holiday) or Sabrina, full of fun and laughter, but she also represents a departure from those genteel characters.  Scenes where it's apparent she's nude under the covers--unheard of for Audrey Hepburn, right?  And her playing an adulterous woman who humiliates her husband?  Albert Finney does well as Mark, and his manners of speech range from the comical Bogart-like voice during their premarital trek to a tired weariness.<br />Two For The Road is also the last movie Hepburn did with director Stanley Donen (Funny Face, Charade).  And upon a personal request from Hepburn, Henry Mancini does another winning theme song, fittingly sweet yet nostalgic.  It sets a precedent for Audrey Hepburn, away from the innocent virgin roles of before.  Despite this being an analysis of a marriage going sour, with moments of frustration and pain, there are moments of fun, and showing how despite changes, maybe being able to accept things as happened and moving with the future will save a rocky marriage such as the Wallaces., puts perspective on things when he tells her &quot;there comes a time when one must grow, when the old things aren't amusing anymore.&quot;  So what does one do when the old things include marriage or being together?

B00003CXCT|2.0|Just adding my two cents to the ranting and raving pro and con the DVD release of the Special Editions of the trilogy. A few points:<br />A) George can certainly do whatever he wishes with these films, doesn't mean the fans who made him rich have to like it or buy it. I liked the original films and won't be buying these... I guess I will never get to see the films I loved as a kid again.<br />B) George is a hack film maker and a hypocrite. In an interview from the early 80s, George makes comments about how \\"some directors get so wrapped up in creating SFX and worlds that they spend film time on it\\" and how that's a bad thing. Now who's guilty of that these days? (The doc is \\"From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Trilogy\\")<br />C) Greedo shooting first, Han stepping on Jabba's tail, Luke screaming as he falls at Cloud City... those are my major complaints about the \\"improvements.\\" Each of these scenes or changes alter the meaning of the shot/sequence and thereby change the film. Let's face it on Jabba's dancers though, that musical sequence ALWAYS sucked.<br />Don't buy these DVDs... eventually, if Lucasfilm has ANY business sense, they'll release the first three films unadulterated.

0380977788|5.0|I only slept two hours the night I read \\"Coraline.\\"  The first few hours I read and finished the book; the next couple hours I couldn't sleep, reveling in the creative world this book took me too that no other book has.  There was not a cliche anywhere: not in story, language, mood, characters.  Instead we have scuttling hands, fortune-telling mice, button eyes, and worlds disolving into nothingness on the outskirts.  <br />The unflappability of the young girl protagonists threatens to make the book too low key (as some reviewers have accused), but instead, I think it adds to the odd, vague tone.  Also accurate in the negative reviews is their observation that there's a lack of background for this world's existence and for the characters in it.  I respond, hallelejah.  How many thousands of books are ruined by too much exposition.  This book gets to the dark, otherworldly story pronto.  Its world is assumed to exist and needs no justification.<br />Stephen King has never creeped me out like this. I'm reading this book to my seven year old daughter (against the advice of my wife) and loaning it to my tough guy, non-reading friend.
B000063DHL|3.0|Considering that before this album Iron Maiden was one of the greatest bands on the face of the earth, it is not expected for them to have a 3 star album. But here on this, they go right ahead and do it. This is not the Iron Maiden that did Powerslave and Number of The Beast. This is a new, melodic, progressive sound. The sound is not as heavy or metal-centric as its predessesors. It sounds more like a synthed-out Queensryche or Rush. It's melodic metal, not really heavy, brutal metal like they had been making. Wasted Years, the title track, and Stranger In a Strange Land are great, but the rest is just too different for me to like. I'm just telling you, this is not the real Iron Maiden. The real sound of Iron Maiden is what they showcased on Number Of The Beast, Powerslave, etc.
B000003N7K|5.0|Many jazzophiles opine that this is the best vocal jazz album ever made.  I don't know that I'd necessarily agree; but I wouldn't argue vociferously for another alternative.  And, I would agree that it's one of the most remarkable ones ever made.<br />Normally, an album with nothing but slow, romantic ballads gets 4 stars from me, no matter what else.  I make an exception here, for these reasons:<br />First, I know that the three principal musicians--Mr. Coltrane, Mr. Hartman and Mr. Tyner--had humongous voices, and when they wanted to, could cause a volcano to begin erupting.  But here, each trades off volume for musicianship.  Every note is caressed and burnished with beauty.  By each musician.  Every note, I tell you.  No voice breaks, no squeaks, no dissonant chords.  Everything in this album is just gorgeous.<br />Second, they did this in one day.  Yes, Trane went in later and added some overdubbing; but the fact that Johnny Hartman could knock out what he knocked out in one day is just mind-boggling.<br />Third, this album just now is getting its due.  When you think of Trane, you think of more spectacular efforts (\\"Favorite Things\\", \\"Giant Steps\\", \\"Love Supreme\\" and \\"Ascension\\"); but his playing was never more beautiful and controlled than here.  And when you think of a big-voiced bass-baritone who could take his instrument anywhere in his range without straining, pinching, or losing pitch, you think of Billy Eckstine or Earl Coleman.  Here, Johnny Hartman was every bit their equal.<br />This album should be in every wedding d.j.'s \\"Playlist\\" in the country.  Though \\"You Are Too Beautiful\\" is my personal favorite, any one of the 6 would do.  This is one of the very few albums I can remember that brought a tear to my eye, the very first time I heard it.

B00005JKHN|5.0|Sleeping Beauty is Disney's retelling of the fairy tale of the same name.  This DVD release of Disney's 75 minute movie features options to view it in either the original 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio, or in a &quot;pan and scan&quot; 1.33:1 aspect ratio version that captures most of the action while using the full height of a standard television screen.  A second DVD includes supplemental material on the history and making of the film.<br />The story itself departs somewhat from the traditional fairy tale version, with a story line that provides a little more scope for character exposition and interaction.  The result still retains a fairy tale feel, and the plot remains simpler than most of Disney's other animated features.<br />The biggest strengths of the movie are in its wonderful animation, artwork, and music.<br />The animation is perhaps the best of any Disney movie.  The animators were exceptionally good at using facial expressions to help tell the story - Maleficent's face perfectly expresses her smug satisfaction when something goes her way, and Princess Aurora's expression when she first meets Prince Phillip by surprise perfectly communicates the various emotions that are running through her.  The animation of the action is also wonderful, with some of the best moments being Aurora's dancing and Phillip's battle with the dragon.<br />The background artwork is terrific.  Each background is really a high quality painting, full of scene specific detail and yet all coordinating to give the picture overall artistic unity and medieval feel.  And yet, all this beautiful background coordinates with the characters in a way that avoids overpowering them.<br />Unlike some of Disney's other animated classics, this film did not use original music, but instead wisely went with Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty ballet music.  Tchaikovsky's beautiful classic music perfectly complements the beautiful, artistic nature of everything else in the film.<br />All the attention to artistry and detail made the film too expensive to be a commercial success in 1959, but it also made the film a timeless classic that can continue to be enjoyed today and far into the future.  Get it now, or you may have to wait seven years for Disney's next rerelease.artistry and detail made the film too expensive to be a commercial success in 1959, but it also made the film a timeless classic that can continue to be enjoyed today and far into the future.

B000255LIY|5.0|Showtime Television has more sophistication in building films than most commercial movie studios and nowhere is that fact more evident than in the 're-make' of THE LION IN WINTER.  Though some would say, \\"Why make another version of the 1968 Hepburn/O'Toole award winning movie\\", to those I would ask, \\"Why continue to reprise the the superb play by James Goldman in theaters around the country?\\" Simply, the play is just that good - an exciting mix of history as explored through the dysfunctional family syndrome tying it all together.<br />The photography of France (as viewed through Slovakia and Hungary settings) in the late 12th century is magnificent, both in exteriors ( Eleanor's entrance on the barge is as grand as Cleopatra's any day!) and in the dank and dark interiors that serve the plot so well.  Glenn Close is radiant and in pitch perfect form as Eleanor of Aquitane, the Queen of England to Henry II's King (Patrick Stewart is fine fettle) and  who has been imprisoned for 10 years for 'treason'.  The couple  has three sons and one must be named Henry's successor, but which one - Richard (historically to be known as The Lionhearted), the wily Jeffrey, or the buffoon but beloved of Henry,  John? (All three of these roles are in capable hands). Eleanor is released from her prison castle for a Christmas Celebration and the entire play takes place during these two stormy days.  The struggle of equally powerful wills of Eleanor and Henry are superimposed on the greed of the three sons, and made more pointed by the arrival of the King of France, Philip (played with complete credibility by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).  Intrigue abounds, secrets long held are made known, and treachery is omnipresent.  But in the midst of this fascinating exposure of monarch history between France and England author Goldman has written dialogue so razor sharp that it suggests Edward Albee's \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe\\": the duets between Eleanor and Henry, the trios and quartets among the brothers and parents, and especially moments like the revelation of the homoerotic relationship between Richard and King Philip are pure theater in the finest sense of the term.  This version of the play is 2 1/2 hours of intense and intensely entertaining bravura acting and direction.  It deserves to be seen , and to be in the libraries of collectors when it becomes available for purchase.brothers and parents, and especially moments like the revelation of the homoerotic relationship between Richard and King Philip are pure theater in the finest sense of the term.

0393057240|5.0|This is, quite simply, the most brilliant book I've ever read. Here's why.<br />1. The Randomness. There is no plot. This is a book about real people, and real people have no plot in their lives. Especially not these people. And by switching POV, you get to see everything. The movie attempts this with Begbie's throwing-the-glass sequence, but it does no justice.<br />2. The Phonetic Spelling. Granted, this book is hard to read, incomparably. But this facet holds up the entire book. You can't get to know a person until you know how they talk - more than that, how they SPEAK each and every word. Also - the slang! You will talk better than any cat you ken, likesay?<br />3. The Personality. You really get to know at least 4 or 5 people in this book, and you like them. Renton the most, then probably Sick Boy, then Begs, then Spud, and the rest of the motley crew. The constantly-switching narrative never says upfront who's speaking, so you learn to identify the gang by speech tags - Hombre for Begbie, Catboy for Spud, the man Sean Connery in general for Sick Boy, and . . . well, let's just say that by the end of the book I could TELL when it was Rents talking. I knew his voice.<br />4. The Cult Nature. It's everywhere...underground. Lots of online fan bases. It's fun.<br />5. The Subculture. Face it, how many of us have shot up heroin in a moldy flat in the slums of Edinburgh? With a really intense accent? This book painstakingly shows you a whole new world, literally. And you come out knowing a lot more about drugs.<br />6. The Message. Trainspotting is a multiple choice question. Here's what happens if you do, here's what happens if you don't. The only judgements in the book come from the characters themselves. Irvine Welsh the author has successfully disappeared - if his skag boys are his &quot;mouthpieces&quot;, then he's completely hidden that fact.<br />In conclusion, read it. This book is the face of modern literature and yes indeed, it deserves to sell more copiesthan the Bible.

B00005YT8U|4.0|When you're talking about Irish music, the Chieftains' name will inevitably come up. In many ways, this seemingly-immortal group pioneered the popularity of jigs and reels, and, thanks to the guidance of pipe player Paddy Maloney, worked to combine traditional fare with the best of pop and rock.<br />Aptly titled &quot;The Wide World Over&quot;, this collection focuses more on the group's recent collaborations with mainstream artists than their traditional pieces. Some of the highlights include the Corrs' light-hearted duet, the traditional 'I Know My Love', Sting's powerful 'Mo Ghile Mar', Van Morrison's 'Shenandoah', and the powerful anthem 'Long Journey Home', featuring Elvis Costello.<br />Why four stars, then? I would have liked to have seen more traditional fare on a compilation album. While there are some fantastic jigs on here, including 'Live from Matt Molloy's Pub' and 'Morning Dew/Women of Ireland', overall the album is lacking in the types of songs that have made the Chieftains famous. And, while the collaborative efforts are commendable, they represent a mere drop in the ocean of what the Chieftains have accomplished. It's a good album, but by no means contains the full spectrum of what this innovative band has recorded.
6304712936|5.0|Let me say this movie was quite interesting.... In this movie, Antonio Salieri, also known as the court composer of the Emporer of Vienna, appeantly murdured mozart and admitted to it to his preacher. Ok, I give this movie five stars because first off, its very very very well done. Second, the movie itself brings interest to the viewer just because its about mozart, and three, the music of mozart attracts the senses of people. Now the only problem with this movie is how un-true it is. First off, we know for a fact Salieri did not murder Mozart. Second, Mozart's requiem was not completed nor worked on by Salieri. Third, Salieri eventually killed himself, and never actaully talked to a priest about murdering Mozart. Fourth, Salieri's father did not die until he was in his later years, possibly after Mozarts death. And Five, Mozart's child died, in the womb... Overall great movie, just wheres the facts?
B000002U82|5.0|Well all I can say is if you haven't heard this cd yet, hang your head in shame...j/k. Most of the songs on here we all know and many I had heard on the radio while growing up. It wasn't until some odd years later that I decided to buy the album. It was sorta like rediscovering all of the songs on here. The album is very well written. Floyd does some awesome tape effects. Not a dull moment here. Another thing I would recommend is listening to this while watching the Wizard of Oz. Pretty cool because the album seems to flow very well with the movie. This is an essential recording for anyone's collection.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|My wife and I watched this movie together and had differing oppinions. She thought it was deep, and so she liked it. I thought it was incredibly slow and boring. It's interesting, because my wife always wants me to create conversation, or make her laugh. But in watching this movie, she states that the actors didn't need to say anything, which they didn't, because they understood each other perfectly. Well, that's nice for them, but it's really terrible for us who have to watch them doing, well, almost absolutly nothing. I mean, there is a reason my wife likes me talk. Just sitting there looking at each other can get frustrating after awhile, even though my wife is beautiful to look at.<BR>  There were times that I was just so annoyed, because I would sit through various scenes just waiting, begging, pleading for Bill Murry and Scarlett Johansson to say something meaningful to each other. And what was I rewarded with for my patience? Zero. I mean they said something, but what exactly was said, was not worth all that waiting. I just couldn't believe that someone would direct a movie this way on purpoes. Maybe as an art project, but certainly not as something meant to entertain us.<BR> To be fair, they did actually have one decent conversation with each other while laying in bed, but even then, Bill Murray was half asleep while they had it. But I can't blame him for sleeping through that dialog; sleep was starting to over take me too.<BR> If it weren't for the beautiful shots of Tokyo and the very cool music that went with the film, and an occational chuckle that I got out of the film, I would have given only one star.
0446677450|1.0|I had many problems with this book: 1) Kiyosaki is a terrible writer, and the cute little anecdotes of his childhood made me gag.  2) Tells people the obvious (making money is better than spending money - duh!).  3) He basically says that being educated financially is better than being educated in a formal system, thereby belittling college education and such.  4) He seems to think that money is equivalent to happiness, therefore the more you have of it, the happier you are.  How wrong he is!  I absoltely detested this book and a lot of the things he had to say, and I am shocked to see that it's supposedly a best-seller.
6304696566|5.0|Even if you've never seen John Ford's THE SEARCHERS, you will have, undoubtedly, seen a film that owes it's 'style' to the film. DANCES WITH WOLVES, THE OUTLAW JOSIE WALES, UNFORGIVEN, JEREMIAH JOHNSON, and OPEN RANGE are just a few westerns that have 'borrowed' from it, but THE SEARCHERS' impact transcends the genre, itself; STAR WARS, THE ENGLISH PATIENT, THE LAST SAMURAI, even THE LORD OF THE RINGS have elements that can be traced back to Ford's 1956 'intimate' epic. When you add the fact that THE SEARCHERS also contains John Wayne's greatest performance to the film's merits, it becomes easy to see why it is on the short list of the greatest motion pictures ever made.<br />The plot is deceptively simple; after a Comanche raiding party massacres a family, taking the youngest daughter prisoner, her uncle, Ethan Edwards (Wayne), and adopted brother, Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), begin a long quest to try and rescue her. Over the course of years, a rich tapestry of characters and events unfold, as the nature of the pair's motives are revealed, and bigoted, bitter Edwards emerges as a twisted man bent on killing the 'tainted' white girl. Only Pawley's love of his 'sister' and determination to protect her stands in his way, making the film's climax, and Wayne's portrayal of Edwards, an unforgettable experience.<br />With all of Ford's unique 'touches' clearly in evidence (the doorways 'framing' the film's opening and conclusion, with a cave opening serving the same function at the film's climax; the extensive use of Monument Valley; and the nearly lurid palette of color highlighting key moments) and his reliance on his 'stock' company of players (Wayne, Ward Bond, John Qualen, Olive Carey, Harry Carey, Jr, Hank Worden, and Ken Curtis), the film marks the emergence of the 'mature' Ford, no longer deifying the innocence of the era, but dealing with it in human terms, where 'white men' were as capable of savagery as Indians, frequently with less justification.<br />Featuring 18-year old Natalie Wood in one of her first 'adult' roles, the sparkling Vera Miles as Pawley's love interest, Wayne's son Patrick in comic relief, and the harmonies of the Sons of the Pioneers accenting Max Steiner's rich score, THE SEARCHERS is a timeless movie experience that becomes richer with each viewing.<br />It is truly a masterpiece!uring 18-year old Natalie Wood in one of her first 'adult' roles, the sparkling Vera Miles as Pawley's love interest, Wayne's son Patrick in comic relief, and the harmonies of the Sons of the Pioneers accenting Max Steiner's rich score, THE SEARCHERS is a timeless movie experience that becomes richer with each viewing.<br />It is truly a masterpiece!

Of course, I can not forget the handful I got to watch through the steamy car windows while parked at a local Drive-In, and those I saw through the smoke filled air while seated beside my older brother and younger sister stuck to the candy covered seats of graceful old theaters.<br />Then, in the late '70's, I can remember talk of this WONDERFUL new invention, soon to be in every American's Living-room: The BETA VCR!<br />\\"WOW! What an amazing idea.\\" I thought. But then snidely snapped, \\"How stupid can these guys get?! Only a moron would sit and watch the SAME movie over and over! Shish.\\"<br />Well, the 'rest of the story' is, though I NEVER did buy a BETA VCR, I do own more than one DVD player, as well as multiple 4 head VHS machines. I sure do love the taste of crow. Which is, perhaps another irony, for the taste of Russell Crowe's performance (and equally that of Paul Bettany & Max Pirkis who played Midshipmen, Lord Blakeney) in \\"Master and Commander\\" is a dish worth consuming many times over.<br />Like I said, I've watched a myriad of films. Most were 'okay'. A Bunch of them were: \\"P.U.\\" Still, after just a few, In wonderment I'd say: \\"Where the heck did my breath go?!\\" The latter are the ones I yearn, and wait around for. Films that really ROCK my soul. Well written, Well adapted, Well crafted, Well acted & performed- e.g.: The Master Works of the film industry. Few films, as far as I am concerned, are worthy of this status- at least in my heart.<br />Now in light of all this magnificent qualification, I list my top ten films, reverse order: 10th: \\"Rob Roy\\" w/ Mel Gibson 9th: Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Rear Window\\", 8th: \\"Schindler's List\\", 7th: Hayao Miyazaki's \\"Spirited Away\\", 6th: \\"Leon, The Professional\\" w/Jean Reno-UNCUT version, 5th: \\"Casablanca\\" w/H.

I don't see A SINGLE THING about \\"Master and Commander\\"! you may be thinking. Please, calm yourselves. I shall explain all. There IS no place for Master and Commander on this list.<br />MASTER AND COMMANDER stands alone.<br />This film, without a doubt, and without the slightest hesitation on my part, is THE finest film I have EVER seen. What I thought I'd brought home was just another gory, splattery, intense action adventure flick- purchased mainly to entertain the tastes of my husband (No offense, dear). It leapt beyond my expectations in the first 15 minutes, revealing itself to be was a rich, amazing view of a long ago world. A world where little boys shouldered the weight of manhood with courage and fortitude. Where friendships held through horrendous test. Where the wit, heart, love, and passion of all characters involved were intricately, and heart wrenchingly revealed. To all players involved: I stand amazed, my head reeling.<br />To all those thinking of buying this version I say, \\"Just Do It.\\" One has to see this film to fully understand it's greatness... for there are not enough adjectives in any language to full describe it.

1582403589|5.0|Rick, a small town Kentucky police officer, awakens from a gun shot induced coma to find the world a very different, and very horrifying, place.  The dead now walk and attack the far out numbered living.  While he slept, the world had ended...<br />While the opening was a tad too close to 28 Days later for my taste (wouldn't it have been more interesting to start at minute zero and progress through the erupting zombie plague?) the story quickly grew on me and, in the absence of a fourth Romero zombie movie, it satisfies.  Required reading for any zombie fan.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums ever, as well as a fav band. You will be happy that you bought it and will want more music. The album will blow you away. I personally am not a rock music fan, but this music just sucked me in and it's really amazing!Really deep and mysterious lyrics. <br />Review:Song by song.<br />1.Going Under- A great song.

6300146154|5.0|Blade Runner tells of human-like robots which are in danger of gaining emotions and becomming too human to exhist by human laws.  I loved this movie when I first saw it and I find it wonderful to notice in the background the company logos (which at the time were powerful up and coming companies) of which most are out of business (though Atari has made a comeback).  The soundtrack sets the tone and the weather (which it always is raining in the film except for the very ending) also keep things looking bleak.  I do enjoy the directors cut cause I am a big fan of Widescreen... but that is the only reason I like it.  I wish they had kept the narration (or at least had a two sided disk so a person could chose to have the original unedited narration or the directors cut version).  I know some people think the narration is the studios way of saying that the audiance cannot understand the film without dumbing-it-down with narration.  This is definitily not the case.  The narration reminds me of those old TV Cop dramas where the cops thoughts are always stated as the action is happening.  I do feel that it adds to the film.  I highly recommend the movie regardless of which version you see.  Rutger Hauer is my favorite.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have been a fan of Brtiney since Baby One More Time, but this is definetely the best album she ever did! I have the bonus tracks, so I will review them as well. <br />Review: Song by song.<br />1.Me Against the Music- A cool song, but not exaclty the highlight of the cd. 8/10<br>2.(I Got That)Boom Boom- A really catchy song, escpeciall with the Ying Yang twins in it. I love the beat. 10/10<br>3.Showdown- Something very different, not to fast and not to fast, an interesting beat. 9/10<br>4.Breathe on Me- I like this song, it's really hot and steamy. Britney sounds really sexy. 9/10<br>5.Early Mornin'- I don't really like this song, I still listen to it, but it ain't my fav. 8/10<br>6. Toxic- Very addictive beats and lyrics. Definetely a highlight and an awesome song.One of my favs. 20/10<br>7.Outrageous- I really like this song, the lyrics are great and the song has great music. 10/10<br>8.Touch of my Hand- Starts sounding very Japanese, but then moves to a very interesting beat, which makes the song unique. 10/10<br>9.The Hook Up- I like the song and it can suck you into listening to it, another song with catchy beats. 10/10<br>10.Shadow- Another one of my favorite song on the album. I love the sound and the lyrics are really deep a moving. 20/10<br>11.Brave New Girl- The POP song of the album. I like the song, but it sounds weird, because it's like she's rapping to a pop beat. However a great song to dance to.8/10<br>12.Everytime- Again, a favorite. Love the melody and the lyrics are really dark and deep. Although, I don't like who they are about.LOL. 20/10<br>13.Me Against the Music(Remix)- A cool remix, but nothing really different then the original. 8/10<br>14.Don't Hang Up-I like this song, it's a different approach from the album. 9/10<br>15.The Answer- I like it, but again, not to fast not to slow. 8/10<br>16.I Just Begun Havin' My Fun- I love this song. It's great and the lyrics are awesome. 20/10<br />Overall, a great album. Top 10 of the year.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Simply Astounding! One of rock's best documentaries has been given the 5 star treatment. The Who have never sounded or looked better! This classic film features some of the Who's best live performances, including the historic Monterey Pop Festival and Woodstock, as well as, a gigantic number of seminal television appearances including the explosive (literally) Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour appearance! The film also features many candid and revealing interviews with the Who during different stages of their career. And everything pertaining to the white whirlwind Keith Moon is simply marvelous. Whether sharing a laugh with Ringo Starr, dressing up in costumes, indulging in his love for surf music or trashing a hotel room, Keith's great sense of humor and eccentricities will bring a smile to your face and make you miss him more than ever! AND you get to witness Keith's last ever performance with the Who. It's very powerful and moving.<br />If you are a Who fan and have not seen this film in years (as I hadn't), you have to buy this immediately! Not only has the film been restored to its original length but you get tons of bonus features on 2 DVD's! The film is in 5.1 Surround Sound and has optional subtitles detailing where each performance originates, director commentary, multiple camera angles on &quot;Baba O' Riley&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;, an isolated John Entwistle audio track, a documentary on the restoration process, an all new interview with Roger Daltry, a 32-page booklet (with lots and lots of information that is actually pertinent to the film) and so much more! All enclosed in a beautiful hardcover slipcase! <br />Quite frankly, this is one of the best DVD packages I've ever bought. It puts most rock DVD's to shame. I hope it becomes the ruler by which all are rock DVD's are judged.

B00008PW3Q|2.0|I really was quite open-minded about Fleetwood Mac (sans Christine McVie) doing a reunion album. I decided not to see the Mac when the tour came to Cincinnati last year (not at $78-$128 ticket prices anyway), but when I had the chance, I picked up the album pretty cheap. I have to say I was quite surprised with what I heard.<br />As &quot;Say You Will&quot; (18 tracks, 76 min.) plays along, you can immediately pick out the songs penned by Lindsay and the ones penned by Stevie. Low and behold, as by chance, each gets to deliver 9 tracks to the album, which at 76 min. truly is 2 solo albums collated together, albeit with the great backing of John McVie on bass and Mick Fleetwood on drums. I can only imagine the tension of sequencing the tracks: after Lindsay gets the first 2 tracks, Stevie prob said, if I don't get the next one, I'm walking. So track 3 &quot;Illume&quot; is a Stevie track, as is track 4! And so on. I guess I wouldn't mind it so much if the music was first class, but the problem is that (surprisingly) there are no really great songs here. I wish I could be more positive, but it all sounds so average, so middle-of-the-road!<br />Who woulda thunk that Christine McVie would've been missed so badly? But the proof is in the pudding: her pop-savvy is missed sorely. As for &quot;Say You Will&quot;: it just doesn't feel like a Fleetwood Mac album, sorry.
0385510438|1.0|I have always been a fan of John Grisham's writing, defending him in the face of my intellectual friends who consider him to be formulaic and predictable.  My response has always been, &quot;Who cares, as long as he keeps writing books with such scintillating plots and characters?&quot;  <br />But this latest offering is a bitter disappointment.  The pace is plodding and never amounts to anything: no suspense, no drama, not even an interesting string of events.  The characters are nothing but cardboard cut-outs.  The book reads like a boring photo album, with quick descriptions penned on the back of each picture.  The most telling sign is the utter lack of emotional depth, especially when this book is apparently supposed to be a heartwarming tribute to Grisham's somewhat idealized memories of the Deep South.  <br />I kept reading this book until the bitter end, convinced that Grisham was going to turn things around.  He doesn't.  Skip this turkey and save yourself the time and aggravation.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Most people hate this film.  People walk out of it asking \\"what was that?\\"  But the people who like it, love it.  It is one of the most praised films of the year and probably  finished second to Lord of the Rings for Oscar's Best Picture.  <br />Therefore, it creates an interesting enigma.  How can one film produce such admiration in some and disdain in most?  The answer lies in its nontraditional storytelling.  Writer/director Sophia Coppola decided to abandon powerful drama, instead opting for a film that focuses primarily on character development.   As far as story goes, the film really lacks a large plot-arc with any kind of driving conflict.  Each scene is enjoyable as little vignettes, but most viewers will search for (and not find) something larger to keep their attention.  The end result is a film with an almost \\"Reality-Tv\\" feel.  It is if a camera crew followed two people around Japan, just to document their lives.<br />What saves this artsy piece is a career performance by Bill Murray.  Many people would enjoy watching him standing in line at the DMV or explaining how Congress passes laws, which is about the level of excitement you should expect from this picture.
158799190X|4.0|nassim added quite a bit of meat, mostly in the back. I thought he would bring more characters and discuss events like september 11 or the nasdaq bubble, but he only added technical material. It is still fun to read.

0440214041|5.0|&quot;The politicians from the governors down took the oil money and played along.  All was well, and so what if some of the marshlands suffered.&quot;<br />Years ago I would read every Grisham book that came out.  John Grisham is a fellow southerner, born and raised in Mississippi, schooled at Ole Miss.  His characters remind me so much of the people I grew up with, remind me of my home.  The Firm is my least favorite of his books which is surprising since the setting for that story is in my hometown of Memphis, TN; the movie was even worse since whoever directed or produced it totally botched the ending.<br />I read this book in one day in my backyard.  I lay motionless in a lounge chair only moving the muscles in my thumb and forefinger; I've never read a book like that in my entire life!

B00003CXCT|1.0|One reason I won't buy these is because if Lucas ever does release the originals I will buy those and never watch this edition.  Also I'm not sure I'll miss much by skipping the making-of documentary since all the new footage will probably be about the added effects and how much everyone loves them.<br />But the main reason I won't get this is because doing so would be doing my part to reassure Lucas that the garbage he's been selling us is satisfactory.
B0001HAISG|3.0|Perhaps my expectations were a little skewed when I finally saw this film. At the time of its release, I recall hearing numerous people grumble about the sexuality inherent in the film. Some parents were even asking for a boycott. And all I have to say after seeing it is, um, why?<br />There were only a few instances that I could see someone taking umbrage at, but even then...I would be more disturbed by a young child being able to read into the body language and posturing to see the dormant sexual themes then by the actual treatment of Pan and Wendy's story. As for teenagers, well, some are prone to actually hunting out anything that may be even minutely sexual in order to make a joke, and this movie cannot be blamed for that kind of action. Suffice it to say that there's enough visual stimulation via the dream-like scenery that any older child/teenager seeing it would be distracted enough to perhaps not even notice. <br />That said, I have to admit that I wasn't thrilled by this adaptation of Barrie's story. A friend of mind told me I had to see it because it was a beautiful film. That was true enough. The colors are lush and it looks like a true fantasy world. And as such you know it's not real. There's no reason to comment on whether or not it looks fake or if the special effects aren't believable. A boy can't fly so what difference does it make if in the film he flies too fast or jumps too far? The effects aren't so badly done that it disrupts the movie and thereby ruins the experience of seeing it. But unfortunately, one of the only things I did enjoy was the sense of place they created for the characters. I liked the fact that it was so rich in sensory detail and that the colors were vast and strong. If I remember nothing else about this particular adaptation, I will remember the brilliantly white clouds enshrouded in a salmon hued sky; the pirate ship held captive in frozen waters; and the true green of Pan's forest.<br />As many other reviewers noted, the young man chosen to play Pan was perhaps not the best actor for the role. Pan was arrogant--how else could a young boy laugh in the face of swordplay with a pirate?--but in Jeremy Sumpter's grin that arrogance became unacceptable. Pan's arrogance after all is, in part, born out of his naivety. He's never experienced the adult world so he has no way of knowing that children rarely hold out against adults. But there is just something in that grin of Sumpter's that puts the viewer on edge. It is perhaps too knowing, too aware, for the character. And, really, it was more than just the grin. Other facial expressions followed that seemed somehow off, which ultimately hurt his performance seeing as how most of it relied not on dialogue (which he didn't carry off well, either) but on physical reactions to all kinds of situations. In short, he was completely unconvincing.<br />Rachel Hurd-Wood was just lovely as Wendy. She was luminously innocent and yet she pulled off the awakening awareness of her character with wonder and grace. Great things should be expected from this beautiful young lady in future acting endeavors.<br />It was Jason Isaacs performance, however, that I enjoyed the most. His portrayal of Mr. Darling was adorable--A devoted, if somewhat exasperated, father who found it most difficult to make small talk. While as Hook he was suitably menacing, but in a more understated fashion than some may have wished, and charming still. Choosing not to read anything into the fact that he played both roles, I think they found a very suitable actor for the part(s). <br />There is so much behind the story of Peter Pan and the Lost Boys. J.M. Barrie's life experiences played such a great role in the creation of it that it's almost a shame that it doesn't shine through more in a live action version of the story. As an adult, I think you appreciate Pan and the boys more for knowing about Barrie's life. But in so doing, it takes some of the shine off of P.J. Hogan's vision. I am not entirely sure why, but I felt it acutely while watching the movie. (...)
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Forget the best of Beethoven and Mozart, this album is purely and simply a masterpiece. I saw clips of the creation of the album, and it wasn't what I expected atall. Most songs would be recorded in some studio down in London, but no not Absolution. To get the right sounds and effects they travelled to specific locations that would give the sound and atmosphere in that song, much more exciting.<br />You dont have to buy it, but you would be losing out on something spectacular...
B00009RAJJ|4.0|Tusk is without a doubt one of my favorite rock albums of all time. The newly remastered edition, with better range and the original version of &quot;Sara&quot; is wonderful. My comments from my original review of &quot;Tusk&quot; still ring true - Lindsey Buckingham's material, though wildly different, is first-rate and Christine McVie's earthy, romantic songs are among her best. Stevie Nicks was at her creative peak during the making of this album and none of her material sounds dated. Disc 2 is the problem here. The outtakes and demos are overkill - we've heard the single versions of &quot;Sisters of the Moon&quot; and &quot;Think About Me&quot; on &quot;Very Best of FM&quot; but we get no outtake of the excellent &quot;Angel&quot; and too many of &quot;I Know I'm Not Wrong.&quot; The most overt example of self indulgence here is the 9 minute demo of &quot;Sara,&quot; which has been making the bootleg rounds for years known as the &quot;Cleaning Lady&quot; version. The extra verses and elongated ending add nothing to the song - unlike the extended version of &quot;Gypsy.&quot;  Alll in all, not a bad deal for the price, but don't waste alot of time on Disc 2.

0312958455|5.0|Its difficult to compare Michael Connelly's books because I don't know how anyone can read one and then not immediately want to read everything that he has ever written like I have.  But if you are new to the series I would say start with this one or Angels Flight.  The Last Coyote is a great mystery story with great characters.  Harry Bosch has been suspended from the LAPD pending a psychiatric evaluation for throwing his supervisor through a plate glass window.  He uses his time off to solve the mystery that has haunted him his whole life, the murder of his own mother in 1961 Los Angeles.  <br />He digs up the police report and soon discovers that it was not quite as thorough as it should have been.  It is a great book.
B00003XACV|5.0|This is one of the most hauntingly beautiful soundtracks I have ever heard. It is very sparing in its instrumentation and varies between spells of repetitive minimalism and plaintively exquisite piano. Oh yes, and my three teenage kids think its great!
0156012197|3.0|Personally, I think that this book has way to many metaphors, which makes it hard to understand. So for this reason, it takes time to actually understand what the characters, especially the Little Prince, is trying to say. For example, a rose is not just a rose, but it actually symbolizes something much more deeper than that. <BR>However, unlike most people, I did not find the book touching at all, maybe because the story was too complicated for me with all its figurative language.<BR>Moreover, people seems to find this book suitable for children, mainly because of the illustrations. However, I think that the content of this book is much too intrigate for children to actually understand, and would be much more suitable for adults who wishes to \\"discover themself\\" or \\"rediscover themself\\"

B00005JMCT|3.0|The interesting thing I noticed about the reviews for this movie is that every review literally has a completely different opinion of it, regardless of how they rated it. Basically, I liked the original American Pie, and I thought American Pie 2 was even better. THIS movie was okay, but I think only people that are really, REALLY into the first two movies can appreciate it.<br />Jim has been dating Michelle for years, and he finally asks her for her hand in marriage, which she accepts. Eventually, Stifler decides to throw Jim a bachelor party, along with Jim's usual friends Kevin, Finch, and Oz -- wait, Oz isn't there. He wasn't even mentioned in the whole movie! What's up with that?<br />I read somewhere that someone said this movie should have been called The Steve Stifler Show. I totally see where that reviewer is coming from (especially since Seann William Scott got higher billing than Alyson Hannigan). Yeah, Stifler WAS the funniest character in the first two movies, but in comparing those movies to THIS one, it seems like the antics and situations he was in have gone from funny and dumb to just dumb -- well, during the first half of the movie, anyway. And you have to admit that the scene in the gay bar wasn't 100% necessary.<br />To me, the only character that was completely funny throughout the whole movie was Jim's dad (I have yet to see Eugene Levy on screen when he isn't extremely funny). The DVD extras weren't all that, either (but are they ever?) The \\"Enter the Dominatrix\\" thing was really kind of pointless, and  the \\"Stifler Speak\\" segment (starring...who else?) really makes you start to wonder just whose movie this is. All in all, though, while not a total waste of time, I'm glad I only rented this movie. But if you already own the other two movies, you might as well add this one to your collection. American Wedding really helped make 2002 the year of Sequels That Nobody Went to See along with Legally Blonde 2 and Analyze That.<br />Anthony Rupert<br />P.S. One thing that's been bothering me for a while...people complain about how vulgar and distasteful these American Pie movies are, yet nobody had a problem with Porky's?>P.S.

B00004VWAF|1.0|\\"On The Corner\\" is the only album that I go back and forth on so violently.  The truth is this:  I don't know how I feel about \\"On The Corner\\".  Unlike any other album I own, my opinion swings from one star to five stars at the drop of a hat.<br />Today I hate it, and consider it to be the absolute, supreme biggest piece of garbage in the Miles Davis discography.  When will people figure out that this is not music?  This is experimental, drug-addled noise, devoid of any feeling or emotion whatsoever.  This is Miles flipping the bird to his devoted listeners, proving that he can record ANYTHING and the fools will rush to buy and praise.<br />But by tomorrow, when I listen to it again, I am sure I will change my mind once again and declare it to be the crown jewel of his music -- Miles' gift to the 21st century.  Who would have guessed that \\"Bitches Brew\\" was not the final glory for the great trumpeter, but rather a mere warm-up for the heavier, denser, more poly-rhythmic swirls of \\"On The Corner\\"?<br />And I'm sure that by the following week, I'll be hating it again.<br />In the end, I consistently believe that the music of \\"On The Corner\\", \\"Bitches Brew\\", \\"Big Fun\\" and others from his electric period was a commentary on the pervasive, mind-numbing technology seeping into Americans' lives.  To Miles (and many others), each technological \\"convenience\\" was in fact yet another avenue to avoid human contact, and therefore feel any emotion.  The deep feeling expressed in classics like \\"Sketches of Spain\\", \\"Kind of Blue\\", and \\"Porgy & Bess\\" is gone, in submission to the pounding menace of \\"On The Corner\\".<br />To me, \\"On The Corner\\" says, \\"Why feel anything?  Why confront our joy or pain?  It's easier to retreat into our air-conditioned homes, turn on the TV, and just hide from the world.  If we HAVE to go out and interact with people, let's drink or smoke or snort our way into oblivion right beforehand.  Then dealing with actual people (and ourselves) won't seem so scary, and we won't fully remember what we heard, saw or said.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie's title, based on a book with the same name, says it all. This it not a movie simply about drug addiction, it is a movie about people trying to get a fix in whatever way they can. The movie starts off with big dreams and ideas, and, like a true Requiem or funeral song would do, mourns the loss of these dreams. This movie is particularly disturbing in its graphic nature, but it is necessary in order to make an impact. This is how life is. There isn't always a great solution, and sometimes everything does get messed up no matter how hard you try to make it right. It does not spare the viewer anything, and in that respect, is not for the faint of heart or those who are easily made uncomfortable. This is an incredibly intense film with no happy ending, but says so much about addiction and life in general, it should be seen by everyone. I would highly recommend this movie.
B0000TB01Y|1.0|This show is horrible.  The music is substandard.  The story is moronic.  How it can appeal to anyone over the age of 10 is beyond me.  Turn your brain off before turning this CD on.  It's a disgrace to the talents of Menzel and Chenoweth.  It's an embrassment to Joel Grey.  It sounds like a bad version of all the rest of Schwartz's shows.  And it completely bastardizes the source material by Gregory Maguire.  If you like the book WICKED this show will offend your sensibilities.  If you have an appriciation for well written shows, this WICKED will offend your sensibilities. Don't waste your time or money on this CD or the tacky and childish show is represents.

B00005JMEW|1.0|I went to see Kill Bill in the middle of a mostly mind-numbing convention.  The movie did nothing to improve my mood.  The level of violence--implied, threatened, and realized--overwhelms what could have been an interesting storyline.  This is commercial exploitation at its schlockiest--before one can understand Kill Bill 1, one needs to see Kill Bill 2, where supposedly all questions will be answered (Who is the Bride?  How did she become an assassin?  Why did someone want to kill her?  Why did they pick her wedding in the middle of Nowhere, Texas?  Who is Bill, anyway?).  I come out of few movies wishing I hadn't wasted my time, but this is one of them.  Skip the DVD and find something good, like Master and Commander.
B0000640VM|4.0|Before the success of such phenomenal Disney musicals like Beauty and the Beast and the Little Mermaid, Oliver &amp; Company came along.  This film totally embodies the eighties with its music, voice talent, and art direction.  The music is very good.  The songs are very hip and cool.  The animation is exciting, and the plot grabs you and sometimes you feel as if you are watching a regular caper movie than an animated film.  An exciting Disney ride that is fun for everybody.  I highly reccomend this film.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Rumsfeld is our McNamara. Some years down the road Rumsfeld will be asked about the mistakes we made in Iraq. Those mistakes will then be seen as the same type made by McNamera as the United States got enmeshed in the quagmire of Vietnam. For example, Vice President Chaney recently said Rumsfeld is the greatest Secretary of Defense we have ever had. In &quot;The Fog of War&quot; that same claim is made about McNamara during the time he was so influential.! The similarities between then and now are made strikingly clear by this film. But--who listens?
B00005JMEW|5.0|With everyone so focused on the blood and gore of this movie, I urge you to think beyond the blood; think of a favorite Japanese graphic novel brought to life.  Think of the ultimate revenge fantasy, where you are so very bad @ss that no one can touch you.  Think invincible, brutally gifted with weapons, and fueled by hate beyond death.<br />Kill Bill is a visually stunning treat for the eyes, and ears, of its viewers; even the blood is overdone in its gushing fountains and sprinkler type sprays.  The background story of O'Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) is entirely done in Anime; expertly done I might add.  Tarentino uses cinematography to its best advantage in this film; stop action shots, slow motion, down angle shots, B&amp;W during the big fight, and the battle in the snow between O'Ren Ishii and The Bride is the tastiest eye candy fight scene I have seen in a very long time.<br />Even down to costume design, Kill Bill stimulates the visual core of your brain even better than the original Matrix.  Direction, choreography, soundtrack, editing, production, acting, everything combines to make one of the greatest revenge fantasies ever filmed.  Really, I'm not even a huge Tarentino fan, and  I still found myself riveted to the screen, even starting the movie over again after my first viewing.<br />The actresses and actors deserve special mention of their own.  Forget Uma Thurman as the pretty little innocent we saw her as in Dangerous Liaisons, she is one hard fighting woman as The Bride, and really mastered the art of sword fighting for her role in this movie.  She does a superb job.  Lucy Liu is both beautiful and dangerous in her role as O'Ren Ishii, her voice as soft as rose petals and her sting as deadly as the Cottonmouth's bite, thus her code name from the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.  Her eyes will quite literally transfix you, you will feel her staring into your soul and know that she would love to see the color of your blood.<br />Also Exceptional in their supporting roles are Vivica Fox and Darryl Hannah, two more beautiful ladies that we never considered dangerous until now.  Unknown in America for any acting is young Chiaki Kuriyama, who plays O'Ren's 17 year old bodyguard GoGo Yubari, a baby faced schoolgirl with dead eyes and a psychotic mind.  And Sonny Chiba, long time veteran of Japanese cinema plays Hattori Hanzo, a retired sword maker.<br />Don't miss the amazing snow-scene fight, the expertly done anime, and the visual and audio treat that is Kill Bill.  Favorite Line?  The Bride, after kicking everyone's hinder at the House Of Blue Leaves, shouts down to them from the balcony, &quot;Those of you lucky enough to have your lives take them with you. However, leave the limbs you've lost. They belong to me now.&quot;<br />Enjoy!pporting roles are Vivica Fox and Darryl Hannah, two more beautiful ladies that we never considered dangerous until now.

6305226296|5.0|For anyone who group up on the Bee Gees, the live album we all owned and loved was &quot;Frampton Comes Alive.&quot; Alright, I know you have all hidden the vinyl copy of that one away in the recesses of your closet and won't 'fess up to spinning that one 24/7 &quot;back in the day.&quot; Well, I have news: this live performance beats any I have heard, it's *that good.* The Bee Gees, like McCartney, have always taken great pains to sing their songs live as closely as possible to the original. I appreciate this and their efforts to duplicate their classics here meet with much success. Particularly amazing is Robin's haunting, gorgeous vocal on &quot;I Started a Joke,&quot; one of the great Bee Gees of all time. Similarly impressive is &quot;New York Mining Disaster,&quot; which shows the brothers still had the ability to harmonize beautifully.<br />The only slight criticism is Barry's high notes and falsetto, which he strains to reach, especially on &quot;Stayin' Alive.&quot; He's backed up with some invisible (and pre-recorded) mystery voices, but his ability to sustain the high notes has decreased with time. Personally, I don't care. This is an awesome live performance and for anyone who admires the brothers Gibb, this is something from which you'll derive hours of enjoyment.
B00004R997|3.0|In this film, we see Disney and his fellow animators travel to Latin America.  In this however, you feel as if you are watching the Discovery channel with a little Disney thrown in.  The film is whimsical when you come across a Disney cartoon, but all the inbetween bits are lackluster and boring.  If maybe you traveled along with Mickey or Goofy it may have been more exciting.  Sorry.  Good but lacks.
0446530891|1.0|Having read and liked Absolute Power, Saving Faith, and other of Baldacci's books, and some of the reviews on the Internet, I was really disappointed. This one is a total waste of money and time.<br />Baldacci lets the characters talk too much about obvious conclusions and then neglects to drop any real hints. The mystery of the villain's identity was a laughable cliché. The main shallow characters, the unconvincing dialogue, the investigators' far-fetched deductions that just happens to be true are all together insulting to the readers' intelligence.<br />This smells of a way for the author to make a quick buck and I don't think I'll buy another Baldacci book again. It is one of the lousiest books I've read in a long time and I read two to three books a week in this very genre. It went straight into the waste paper basket after I finished it.
B00004U8JV|3.0|This movie was okay. The first one is so much better, but this one is still not bad. I thought it was awesome when the T-Rex attacked a city!

B000009EUM|2.0|There  was a lot I wanted to like about  a-ha's Scoundrel Days.  It was a follow-up album to an absolutely sensational album in \\"Hunting High and Low\\".  My expectations remained high once I got the CD - it had a beautiful almost \\"scandinavian feel\\" with shades of blue and green making for a mountain and ocean-like feel.  Not only that as I started playing the first song I was very impressed, but then after that I was completely shocked - the CD becomes a major letdown as there really isn't much that follows this.   The question becomes \\"what went wrong\\"?   <br />The first song is the title track &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot;.   The formula is the same as from &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot;, some great Pål Waaktaar songwriting using the power of lead singer's Morten Harket's voice.      In fact this song is as good as any by a-ha.   The second song is solid as well &quot;The Swing of Things&quot; kind of reminds me of &quot;Train of Thought&quot; from the first album.     But as the album progesses, it is clear to me that this sophomore effort might have been rushed a bit.   The success of the first album might have rushed a follow-up only a year later.    The big problem is that the songs just don't have that &quot;something special&quot; like the first album.   The only other song that is up there is &quot;Maybe Maybe&quot;.  Harket's vocals do soar in this song - the problem is its only a 2 minute song, but this was a Mags song - not a Pål Waaktaar song.  Waaktaar is a much better songwriter.<br />While Morten Harket really did a great job on &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot;, I don't think Harket could elevate the tracks on &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot;. The funny thing is that Alan Tarney is the album's main producer.  Tarney produced the two big hits on &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; which were &quot;Take on Me&quot; and &quot;The Sun Always Shines on TV&quot; (Tony Mansfield produced the bulk).  Tarney knew what a gem he had in Morten Harket's voice, so I'm questioning a lot of what he was doing with many of the songs on the album.  To me a song like &quot;October&quot; doesn't provide the forum for Harket to use that great voice.   &quot;Manhattan Skyline&quot; to me seems a bit labored by Morten and the group.    On &quot;Cry Wolf&quot;, I also think that Morten could have done much more with his voice.   .  I do like &quot;We're Looking for the Whales&quot; because it was a different type of a-ha song - its a pop song like &quot;Take On Me&quot;, but a little more catchy - but again Harket's dynamic vocals just don't do much here.  <br />The liner notes do contain all of the lyrics and all of the credits, so that is a plus.<br />I think die-hard a-ha fans will like this album, but the average fan will probably have this on their shelf more.   I loved &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot;, but saw a tail off on this album.   By commercial standards this album didn't do well in the U.S. and is probably the reason why a-ha is categorized (unfairly) as a one hit wonder.     If you manage to get this album at a good price, you will be treated to the three good songs I mention above, but otherwise you'll probably overpay for what isn't a great body of work.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|This film is the ultimate Rat Pack movie.  It has great story, acting, music, everything that is required in a teen movie, it has.  The acting is good, and the plot grabbs you.  Detention can actually be fun.  The best and the greatest.  I highly reccomend this film.

B0000YEEHG|5.0|This is one of the best rated films of all time...and it's definetely justified. It might very well be Bergmans materpiece, and THAT says a lot. The story behind one of the greatest achievments in cinema history was (is); Liv Ullmann, Bibi Anderson, Sven Nykvisk and Ingmar Bergam....That's the whole movie !!! Only 4 people,but it doesn't get much better than this. It's perfect -
B0001HLVS2|4.0|This is definately one of the best films of 2003, however, did it deserve all of those nominations.  They deserved a lot, but Best Picture it did not deserve the nomination.  Movies like Cold Mountain were definately better than this, no matter how good this was.  Russel Crowe did a great job.  The effects were spectacular, and the art direction really was well.  They kept to the look of the period, especially in the costumes and props.  The movie was good but lead up to be better.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is in a league of its own - there is absolutely nothing else that compares with it! The writing, cinematography, music score, special effects and acting set a new standard for Sci-Fi. Over the past 30+ years, the only thing that possibly comes close is the original Star Trek series - and even that's debatable.<br />&quot;Ground-breaking&quot; may be an over-used cliche, but it certainly applies in this case.<br />If you only buy one sci-fi DVD set this year (or even this decade!), make it this one.
0743454529|1.0|I cried at the ending of the book, but more out of rage for Anna than anything else. I was deeply disapointed. I believed in her and saw her a something other than a donor for Kate. Which is more than can be said for Sara. I felt nothing for her. Anna got cheated majorly she only had one purpose in life. I don't think that what they asked her was ethical, organ donation at that young age would impact her life forever. No one thought about that. I don't feel that Sara really saw Anna until the lawsuit. The ending had me wanting to throw the book across the room. I cried for Anna because she's the one who suffered in the end. I guess the end makes sense, Sara got her way and Kate lived, Anna was just the means to end.
B00005JMUA|5.0|If you have seen the first one this latest edition is slightly different. Rather thatn a kungfu flick this movie is more of a spaghetti western. It is executed perfectly keeping the whimsical characters the funny hijinks and the off the wall fight scenes while tieing the story up pure genious. The chinese martial arts master is by far the best character in the movie with his random beard swinging and funny expressions. If you havent seen any of these movies you are retearded and should pick up the first one on dvd and see the 2 in theatres, also check out tarantinos other films they have to be watched as well.
B000002LRX|5.0|What people on here have been saying about this album is no lie. It really is the best album of all time. I probably listen to it more than anything else. No, it's not radio-friendly and I don't think the Linkin Park loving little kids would get it. I think that's what's great about it. It's catchy and easy to listen to to the trained ear but not to mainstream music fans. The general &quot;Real Thing&quot; loving public didn't get it and anybody who loves this album like I do feels like they're in on something very special that only exclusive people know about. Needless to say, it's the most underrated album of all time. My personal favourites are Jizzlobber and RV, but other than that, it is way too impossible to pick my others because all the songs have different characteristics.
B00005JL78|4.0|Director:  Steven Spielberg<BR>Cast:  Tom Cruise, Max Von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton.<BR>Running Time:  140 minutes.<BR>Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.<br />Steven Spielberg is perhaps the only director in the history of film who has the ability to extract almost every human emotion in all of his films, whether its true terror (\\"Jaws\\"), utter anguish and despair (\\"Schindler's List\\"), absolute awe (\\"Jurassic Park\\", \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\"), pride (\\"Saving Private Ryan\\"), laughter (\\"Hook\\"), and love (\\"E.T.\\").  \\"Minority Report\\" is a film that promotes suspicion, and more importantly, how greed can deteriorate the soul.<br />In the year 2054, Tom Cruise stars as a prominent law enforcement agent who has the uncanny ability to envision murders and crimes before they are committed.  Because of agents such as Cruise, the criminal justice system is impeccable and without failure, saving lives and putting those who endanger others into jail.  With the tragic loss of his lover (Samantha Morton), John Anderton (Cruise) feels as though life can get no worse; until he becomes the subject of a pre-cognitive murder that he did not commit.  With an FBI agent (Colin Farrell) only a step behind him, Anderton must come to realize why he has been framed, how he has become a suspect, and who the real killer is.<br />Cruise is dynamite as the heroic officer of \\"PreCrime\\", jumping from flying, hovering aircrafts (yes, it is 2004 for crying out loud) and blending a poignant, confounded ingredient to his character that not many others would have pulled off.  Spielberg delivers his most authoritative picture since \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", enchanting the audience using superb special effects and a cerebral screenplay based off Philip K. Dick's brilliant short story.  The film can often be superiorly confusing for those who do not follow all of the technological jargon, which may throw many viewers off.  With that shoved aside, this latest Spielberg effort has a little bit of everything.  Not a classic, but not a small, futuristic, step from it.
B0001I55OC|1.0|Like many of the reviewers, I was expecting something a little different - albeit, much better here. Timeline reminded me of a bad made-for-TV movie. With it's no name actors, unlikeable characters (goons) and plot holes, it certainly was not at the level you would expect from someone who wrote Jurassic Park. Although, I don't blame Michael Crichton for this dud.<br />If you were expecting an interesting time travel jaunt through 14th century France. Forget it. The historical characters portrayed in this movie are all cardboard cut-outs with nice teeth. In fact, what I found most annoying was how easily they converse with the 21st century visitors. The English that was spoken 600 years ago would sound like a foreign language today. You wouldn't be able to understand them. In addition, due to the lack of nutrition, people from that era would have been much smaller in stature (the average man perhaps no taller than 5'4&quot;). As such, if you're going to make a movie about people traveling back through time, at least portray the basic historical facts correctly.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie you have to watch more than once so it is a good idea<BR>to buy it. The whole story starts at the end and the story unfolds backwards. I know it sounds confusing but believe me<BR>you will want to watch it over and over.

The cast is great<BR>and this movie rocks.
6305949980|5.0|A film by Henry Selick<br />Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown.  Jack is tired of the same old Halloween with the same old scares and the same old countdown to the next Halloween.  Depressed by the routine, Jack walks away from Halloweentown and discovers a door in the forest.  This door has the image of a tree engraved on it and through the door Jack discovers Christmastown!  Singing \\"What is this?\\" (a great song), Jack discovers the wonder of Christmas and decides that he wants to bring Christmas to Halloweentown.  When he returns, he gets the whole town to prepare for Christmas.  He explains that it doesn't matter what is in the present, but only that it is wrapped and looks pretty.  To make sure that Jack can be the new Christmas King, he has Santa Claus kidnapped.<br />I don't think \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" is appropriate for the youngest viewers because it will probably be too scary for them.  It was a little creepy for me, and I'm 25.  It was also a very good movie.  I'm always apprehensive about musical numbers, but there are some very good songs (a highlight that I've mentioned is Jack's song \\"What is this\\" as he discovers Christmastown), and fanstastic animation.  Tim Burton is one of the screenwriters and it has some of the darker hallmarks that are a part of his work.  This is a great movie for Halloweentime, Christmastime, or any time of the year.
B00000G3PA|4.0|Director:  Michael Bay<BR>Cast:  Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan.<BR>Running Time:  151 minutes.<BR>Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.<br />&quot;Armageddon&quot; opens with a NASA spacecraft being torn apart by numerous small asteroids, destroying the ship and killing all of the inhabitants.  Large cities across the country are then bombarded with meteors, causing NASA to investigate the strange phenomenom.  They conclude that a massive, mother asteroid the size of Texas is on course to directly hit the planet Earth, killing all civilization and life as they know it.<br />NASA excecutive director Dan Truman (Thornton) decides that the best way to defend the world against this devastating threat is to hire a group of oil diggers (?) and actually send them onto the meteor (?) in order to plant an explosive inside the middle of it (?) so it can be destroyed before it makes contact.  Bruce Willis stars in an adequate performance as the leader of the ragtag team of riggers, taking his team (which includes daughter Tyler and her lover Affleck) to the core of the planet's brink of elimination.  While the story is so farfetched and ridiculous to be that realistic, fine performances throughout coupled with some hilarious, quirky dialogue saves this film from being a run-of-the-mill special effects guru blockbuster.<br />Superb special effects, riveting and off-the-wall cinematography created by the one-and-only director Michael Bay (&quot;The Rock&quot;), a fantastic musical score featuring the Aerosmith great, &quot;I Don't Want to Miss a Thing&quot;, and a touching, powerful ending. Fun, enjoyable; this rock-em, sock-em roller-coaster of a film is what summer movie-going is all about--even if its on DVD.
B000002A46|4.0|Mariah Christmas album really shows off her talent. My favorites are &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot; and &quot;Baby Please Come Home&quot;
B0000DD7LB|5.0|First of all, those people at the bottom critizing Britney and saying all bad things about her are just dumb and stupid people, who probably don't have a job and all they do is just critized the best celebrities. OK, now that I said that, I believe that this album is the one of the best, like all the other albums Britney has made. It has a very good toone, all the tracks are just perfect. They really show how Britney has grown since the last 5 years. All tracks are my favorite, specially TOXIC, which was #1 for many weeks, didn't want to leave that spot :). So all those people who all they do is say crap about Britney are crazy and should get a better job. Is not like Britney is gonna listen to them. Down with you, all you Britney haters.
B0000070QS|5.0|Like one of the previuos reviewers, I have well over a thousand cds. This stands up as one of my top ten all time favorites because of Harket's superb voice and song writing. A truly under rated artist in the often questionable pop world, which is full of minor talents who are grossly over rated. The mass will just never know because thay are spoon fed mediocrity which rely nowadays on expensive video productions.The music on this recording stands up on it's own without visuals. A rare thing!. 'Wild Seed' is for the discerning minority who appreciate true (un-hyped)talent.I hope Morten has many more recordings to follow. Superb and highly reccomended, as are the last 3 studio recordings by A Ha.
B000002MY3|5.0|I have all of her albums, and without a doubt this his her best!!! My favorite songs are &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, &quot;Forgiven&quot;, &quot;You Learn&quot;, and &quot;Ironic&quot; BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
0793518326|5.0|If you have a love for the Beatles and really want to learn what they did and how they made it so good, this is the book. It's been my constant musical companion over the last three years and has made me a better guitar player as well as given me insight into the secondary parts that made the songs so great.<br />I recommend this book to anyone into music and especially other musicians and Beatle nuts. Throw out all your other Beatle song books and buy this. There's none better.<br />cheers!
B000024D4R|3.0|I used to think this was five stars in my youth, but now listening to it some 25 years later, I think Animals is the beginning of the end of Pink Floyd.  This is where Rodger Waters' darkness starts to take over the band and it will eventually lead to The Wall and then their breakup.  Although, according to Rodger, the band wasn't into it anymore after Wish You Were Here (except for Gillmore).  This is probably true since Waters bought in studio musicans for The Wall.  The concept of people either being catagorized as Pigs, Dogs, or Sheep was cool when I first heard it, but now I think that concept is inane.  As a matter of fact, it makes the album NO FUN compared with Dark Side, and Wish You Were Here. Musically, it is one of their best.  Gillmore does quite well with the acoustic guitars and the dog bark sounds and the Pig sounds etc.  If you are new to Floyd, your safe bet is Dark Side or Wish You Were Here.  If you're really into those and want more then buying this can't hurt.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park is truely the best band to ever play music, and Meteora shows this full force.  I have heard every song Linkin Park has ever made a million times; I loved them when I first heard them and I still listen to them every day, every single one because they can't make a song that isn't good!  Their music is the best ever, so make sure you get Meteora or you will be missing out severely!!!
B000002J09|5.0|The simple fact is that Led Zeppelin are by far the most influential and ground breaking band ever. People say `Nirvana rewrote music' or `they made a new era' blah, blah, blah.....Well, if it wasn't for Led Zep Nirvana probably wouldn't even be a band. Along with other 70's giants such as Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple, Led Zep created rock. The nearest anyone had come to rock before them was T-Rex, aka Mark Bolan, albeit relatively mainstream. People were sick of the old, the Perry Como's or Bing Crosby's, Led Zep was new and hip. People had HUGE hair, pink suede pipe trousers, dodgy moustaches, and played Stairway To Heaven ALL DAY!! They are the gods of rock, the ones who made it happen. If you call yourself a fan of rock, metal, nu metal, even goth fan, and you haven't heard, or you dislike Led Zep, you simply DON'T DESERVE your cd's.<br />To the actual album -  Well, its miraculous, as you would expect. It's my favourite Led Zep album due to it's consistency and it's highly listenable throughout. Some Led Zep albums contain long, rather static songs, which break up the genius. But this is SIMPLY INCREDIBLE!!! There are no lacking songs. It's the album you always wanted. It starts with one of my favourite Zep songs, Black Dog. It gets me everytime. I just can't help not to get up and dance like a possessed monkey wailing along with Plants brilliant vocals. The riff is pure genius from Page, and that's just one of the songs. Then, we get the first taste of the master John Bonham. As a drummer myself, this guy is THE DRUM GOD!! He was the reason I played drums, he is what I can only call `sick' on those babies. His hand speed started a revolution of mental drummers, hitting things as rapidly as humanely possible! Wonderful. Anyway, he starts off Rock and Roll with the famous snare rhythm intro. Aaah! Utter brilliance! My other two favourites are of course Stairway To Heaven and When The Levee Breaks. Firstly, Stairway To Heaven, everyone knows this song. Everyone I know, no matter what music they normally listen to, absolutely love this song. It is far more influential than Nirvana's biggest hit, Smells Like Teen Spirit, or any other song, EVER. The song progresses through the quiet and beautiful guitar intro and gentle vocals, to a more sinister chord pattern and gradually builds to the end solo and chorus WHICH IS F**KING AMAZING!!! Sorry, excuse my language. THE SOLO IS F**KING GENIUS!!! ....Um. Yeah......so.....anyway, When The Levee Breaks is a great song, it starts slowly and gradually builds to a brilliant guitar masterpiece.<br />On a whole, Led Zep created rock. I don't care for your Nirvana's or anyone alse, Led Zep made it happen. They had the best and most influential guitarist and riffmaster ever, the most influential drummer ever, the most influential vocalist ever.... BUY THIS ALBUM.ong.

B00003CXCT|1.0|With all this money he is getting, when is George Lucas going to have that goiter removed from around his neck?<br />The first film (or I guess number 4) is ok and the Empire Strikes Back is wonderful, but then the films all became kiddified & stupid. The prequels are absolutely dreadful & Ewoks must die!
B000001ESF|5.0|I used to listen to Rush in high school some 20+ years ago.  I had all their albums up until Farewell To Kings.  I saw them in concert with UFO in Santa Monica (small club) on the Farewell To Kings tour and then after that I couldn't stand them anymore.  Not because of the tour, but I think I just burned out on them totally.  I never purchased another Rush album and never replaced their records with the CD's and never listened to them again. It wasn't until I went skiing last winter in Tahoe, and they had 2112 just blasting in the ski lodge that it was like hearing them for the first time and I realized their creative original art. Of course I purchased the remastered CD of 2112 and after re-introducing myself to it, I do believe this is a lost masterpiece for me. Sorry Neil, Getty, Alex, I won't leave you again!
B00006RU5B|5.0|There is not a single bad track on this album. If you were a rage fan or not, you will still appreciate this album. Cochise is very much a rage-like track, but most of the others arnt. Show me how to live is one of the best tracks on the album, with a powerful riff and some excellent vocals from Cornell, whose voice really grows on you.<BR>All the tracks are good, but some are very different from others, such as I am the highway, a beautifully calm track and The last remaining light.<BR>If you are openminded (or not) you should buy this album because you will not stop listening to it.
B0001AP12G|4.0|great lyrics especialy in songs like Jesus walks. The only problem with the cd and the reason i give it 4 stars is because there are a lot of skits. It seems as if half of the cd is full of skits. <br />My top  favorite songs are<BR>1)All falls down<BR>2)Through the wire<BR>3)Never let me down<BR>4)Spaceship<BR>5)Jesus walks<BR>6)Two Words
B0000029DD|5.0|I consider music to be the most powerful art form because of its ability to convey.  What it conveys is obviously up to the artist, but it seems that all of the other qualities people hold dear in their music, honesty, integrity, passion, etc., can be summed up by saying that good music simply communicates and expresses the self.  It serves as reflection of something that shines within an individual.  <br />That being said, this album is the epitome of all of the above.  Only rarely has all of those qualities been applied to just an artist's voice.  Buckley's gift to the world was how much he could communicate by just singing a note.  There didn't even have to be a word associated with the note, just him singing, and you could instantly see what was going on inside him.<br />I also wanted to address an important aspect of Grace that seems to escape the other reviewers: the backing band.  Matt Johnson is an incredible drummer; not in the Neil Pert or John Bohnam way, but he is just so tight with his playing.  The guitars and strings are arranged to be nothing more than a vehicle to take Buckley's voice somewhere, and they do this in superb fashion.  The production, thanks to industry heavyweight Andy Wallace, is excellent as well, capturing all of the timbres of Buckley's voice as well as his guitar playing.<br />Grace is simply an essential album for anyone that calls themselves a music lover.  I know some people will fail to see the beauty of this record, especially now in the age of &quot;sick&quot; and &quot;extreme.&quot;  Grace is neither sick or extreme.  It doesn't need to be.  All of those sick and extreme bands are hiding behind their &quot;sickness&quot; or &quot;extremeness.&quot;  Jeff Buckley isn't hiding, he's baring it all and moving something deep inside me as a result.
B000006TRV|2.0|One of the stars is for Gillmore's solo on Comfortably Numb and the other is for the song Comfortably Numb.  Great Song! However, none of the other songs come close on this too long and too dark of a CD. Ok there's some OK AM radio stuff so maybe 2.5 stars. WARNING: Don't buy this until you hear it a least a couple times. It's for special musical tastes. It's not like Dark Side or Wish.
B000083E79|5.0|This is by far the best &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album to come out in a while.  It is definitely a must-have for those who appreciate Cher's music.  This album truly captures this singer's great talent.  Only a very small minority of artists can have a successful career ranging through four decades like Cher has.  This is definitely the Queen of Pop!
0790729725|4.0|Very well done movie in which is suppored by a well rounded acting corps.  The acting in it is great and the storyline is very well done.
B00004XOWM|4.0|FRED DURST AND THE REST OF LIMP BIZKIT REALLY DONE THINGS RIGHT ON THIS ALBUM! THIS CD ACTUALLY HAS THE BAND'S BEST MUSIC. <br />SONGS NOT TO MISS;<BR>''ROLLIN''<BR>''ROLLIN'' [URBAN ASSAULT VEHICLE]<BR>''MY WAY''<BR>''FULL NELSON''<BR>''TAKE A LOOK AROUND'' [WHICH WAS ON THE ''MI-2'' SOUNDTRACK]<br />FOR ALL LIMP BIZKIT FANS, THIS IS A DEFINITE MUST-HAVE. FOR OTHERS, IT'S MORE OF THE SAME STUFF THAT YOU'LL PROBABLY HATE ANYWAY. BUT, I KNOW THIS ALBUM ROCKED. CAN'T NO ONE MAKE ME THINK ANY DIFFERENTLY.
B000002MTU|4.0|This is, hands down, Clapton's best guitar playing. It's all there. The phrasing is immaculate and tasteful. In terms of timing he's playing ahead of the beat, behind it, and everywhere around it. This is a development in his technique. Overall, he just sounds like he's on the blues war path. He had just quit smoking which could explain the burst of energy. Otis Rush claims this is one of the top ten all time blues guitar albums. The only thing holding this album back is that it's all covers. This is a minor criticism to an otherwise masterpiece of guitar work by &quot;God.&quot;
B00000JCB2|4.0|THIS TIME AROUND, LIMP BIZKIT IMPROVED THEIR SONGS AND FRED DURST IMPROVED HIS SINGING AND RAPPING. FROM START TO FINISH, THIS CD F***IN ROCKS!<br />BEST SONGS OF THE ALBUM ARE;<BR>''NOOKIE''<BR>''NO SEX''<BR>''SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT''<BR>''BREAK STUFF''<BR>''N2GETHER NOW''<br />I WOULD DEFINITELY RECCOMEND THIS CD TO ANY FAN OF LIMP BIZKIT OR ANYONE WHO JUST LIKES HEARING PEOPLE RAP TO HEAVY METAL GUITARS. GET THIS ONE NOW!
B00004W50T|5.0|I have heard Eric Clapton say on several occasions that this is the album that changed his life. Make that two changed lives. The Band has a way of blending all kinds of American musics into seemless masterpieces of poetry. Music from the Big Pink is the Band's perfect expression of this idea. Every song on here is a winner. But to me, the real jems are the upbeat Caledonia Mission and We Can Talk. They just have of way of celebrating music and sounding like it on these songs. Eric Clapton went to see the Band after breaking up with Cream. Robbie Robertson told him that they didn't do jams. Ironically, the Band jam on this album with four minute songs of pure folky bliss.
B000001Y42|1.0|THIS IS LIMP BIZKIT'S DEBUT ALBUM. AND UNFORTUNATELY, THIS WAS A VERY POOR FIRST IMPRESSION. OUT OF ALL THE SONGS ON HERE, ONLY 3 OF THEM WERE ANY GOOD ANYWAY! ONLY GOOD SONGS ON HERE WAS ''COUNTERFEIT'', ''POLLUTION'', AND OF COURSE, THE BAND'S COVER OF THE GEORGE MICHAELS CLASSIC ''FAITH''. LIMP BIZKIT'S MUSIC WOULD EVENTUALLY GO ON TO GET BETTER, BUT, I WOULDN'T ADVISE A NEW LIMP BIZKIT FAN TO START HERE. SKIP THIS ONE AND BUY ''SIGNIFICANT OTHER'' AND ''CHOCOLATE STARFISH''.
1592400876|5.0|As an English teacher, I often cringe at the types of grammatical errors that Lynne Truss covers in her latest book, Eats, Shoots, and Leaves.  This is a wonderfully accessible book for those who want to learn more about punctuation but who were afraid to ask.  The information covered is what we should have all learned in junior high--They call it grammar school for a reason, after all.  Anyway, this is a fun and very readable approach to punctuation and will help you become a better writer and communicator.
1559408855|5.0|This is not a review of Salo, enough words have been said about it already. What this is is just a few words to all you people thinking of shelling out lots of money for a (probably fake) second hand Salo DVD from the Criterion collection. Go to Amazon.co.uk and get a fully uncut BFI (British Film Institute) print for a lot less. Hope this saves you some money!!
0385512104|3.0|Mark Haddon's sometimes heartfelt first novel tells the story of a Christopher, an autistic 15-year old who embarks on a investigation to find out who killed his neighbor's dog. Along that journey, we get a glimpse in to the mind of a person with autism, his need for logic, his black and white understanding of the world, and the quiet exasperation that he evokes in his parents.<br />There is an awful sense of humanity in this book, a dark suggestion of the daily struggle that Christopher's parents deal with while trying to raise a son that can't understand society's norms.  It is this suggestion that touched me the most.  At many moments, I felt for Christopher's parents, not for him.<br />Mark Haddon has spent many years working with this kind of syndrome, and I do not doubt that he is intimately familiar with the constant battles that people with autism face.  And he is successful at depicting these battles.<br />But it is difficult for someone who has never known an autistic person personally to find the greater importance of this novel on a literary scale.  I had it's title in my head for several weeks before buying it, and think that I should have just waited for a used paperback.  It is a quick read, and certainly puts the reader in the mind of a young person with autism -- which is probably its greatest feat.  But I think that the comparisons that I have read of this book to Faulkner's &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; are nothing more than publicist's speak.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Ok, This cd was the best one I've heard out of two and the songs onthis are AWESOME.
B0001GL3K4|4.0|Last Thanksgiving I went to visit my little sister who lives 12 hours away from me.  We are very close and hadn't seen each other in quite some time.  We went to see this film while I was there, and though I'm sure the fact that I was visiting and would have to leave again soon affected us, this movie touched both of us and brought us both to tears on more than one occassion.  The movie follows quite a few different characters and their various relationships.  All of them are connected with each other in some way, which you see as the movie unfolds.  Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister is a RIOT!  Perhaps the most touching is Liam Neeson, a recent widower and his adorable step-son.  Neeson's character deals with his grief by helping his step-son get the coolest girl in school to fall in love with him.  Emma Thompson also shines (but when does she not?) as a woman who discovers that her husband (the always captivating Alan Rickman) may be having an affair.  Also touching is the young man who is in love with his best friend's wife, but in an effort to conceal his feelings, treats her cruelly.  Cynics and maybe even people who have not truly ever been in love may find the film fluffy and pointless.  Not surprising if you have never experienced those types of feelings before.  If you have, trust me...you'll &quot;get&quot; this film.  I've also seen some complaints here about too many characters to follow.  I didn't have a problem with this at all.  The film in no way seems overcrowded.  It is not confusing in any way and in fact you NEED all of these people to convey the entire message of the film which is:  Love is all around.  And what a great group of people it is!  Thompson, Firth, Grant, Neeson, and Rickman are all WONDERFUL.  At the beginning and the end of the film, we are treated to scenes from airports all around the world.  Real people greeting their loved ones.  The joy and love evident at an arrival gate at the airport is truly palpable.  And it is in this film as well.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I cannot believe that I never heard of this movie.  I rented it, after reading good reviews on amazon, and thought that it couldn't be that good, because I've never even heard of it.  Boy, was I wrong.  This is a superb movie.  If you are an action/sci-fi movie lover, this one is for you.  But it's more than that.  The story itself is fantastic.  The best way to explain it, is a mix between &quot;The Matrix&quot; and Orwell's 1984.<br />Christian Bale did a fantastic job in this flick, and because of this movie, I now consider him one of the most unerrated actors today.  (Ever seen Spielberg's Empire of the Sun? He was in that as a young boy, and was a great actor even then.) That will all change soon though, as he is soon to take on the mantle of the Batman in Warner Bros's new revitalization of the Batman franchise.  Watch this movie and you will see what a good dark knight he is going to make.  Overall, I highly recommend seeing this movie, and I think it will make an excellent addition to your DVD library.
B000000W5N|5.0|This album is one of the Rolling Stones greatest of all time. &quot;Beggars banquet&quot;, &quot;Let it bleed&quot; and &quot;Exile on main st.&quot; are also great. Features many memorable songs (&quot;Brown sugar&quot;, &quot;Wild horses, &quot;Cant you hear me knocking&quot;, &quot;You gotta move&quot;, &quot;I got the blues&quot;, &quot;Sister morphine&quot;, &quot;Dead flowers&quot; and &quot;Moonlight mile&quot; are awesome). Do yourself a favour and buy this classic, Im sure you wont regret it! Thanks for reading.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I cannot praise this album more than the postive reviews have already done here. Its simply a modern and classic breath of fresh air. I listened to this album 3 times tonight... and it is genuinely breathtaking. Unfortunately, with her newest CD now out and its pop bland nature clear, this may be the last of the great Krall albums. Here she is an artist who studied intonation, expression and passion, before selling out.<br />On the newest CD &quot;Girl in the Other Room&quot;, she has bent her art to her pop husbands wishes and released an album that is depressing, whining and bland beyond measure. It is obvious that she has now allowed herself to be marketted to the less demanding and ultimately fickle pop audience that will enjoy her until they spit her out... and her loyal jazz fans will not come back. DO NOT JUDGE KRALL BY THAT ALBUM.... keep the faith and let's hope she comes back to the enduring and classic sound of the music heard here on &quot;Live in Paris&quot;.<br />BUY this album, OR &quot;Look of Love&quot;, &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Love Scenes&quot; or any of her previous efforts if you want to know what truly beautiful and timeless music can sound like from a woman who IS TALENTED and can create art with her subtile and delicate voice. This album is wonderful!!
B000000W5L|5.0|This album is considered the Stones finest, but actually it isn't their masterpiece. &quot;Let it bleed&quot; and &quot;Sticky fingers&quot; are even better. My favourite songs in this album are: &quot;Rocks off&quot;, &quot;Tumblibg dice&quot;, &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot;, &quot;Torn and frayed&quot;, &quot;Sweet black angel&quot;, &quot;Loving cup&quot;, &quot;Happy&quot; and &quot;Shine a light&quot;. As you can notice, there are many great songs; but the only reason why I think this isn't their best is because the B side isn't very good.<br />Anyway, it is a worth buying album. Therefore, buy it as soon as you can, I'm sure you won't regret it. Thanks for reading again.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I am charmed by this album by Norah Jones. This CD was so good, jazz songstress Diana Krall copied it's style in her newest CD called &quot;Girl in the Other Room&quot;... and it can't come close to this, the original. Jones is sultry, spicy, but never dull. She can pour emotion into a song with great style and remain her own woman. I like this one and recommend it highly. Accept NO substitutes if this is your kind of music.. this is the best of the crop!
B00006AW2G|5.0|&quot;Let it bleed&quot; is considered their best album by many fans. Every song is a must listen. &quot;Gimme shelter&quot;, &quot;Live with me&quot;, &quot;Let it bleed&quot;, &quot;Midnight rambler&quot;, &quot;You got the silver&quot;, &quot;Monkey man&quot; and &quot;You can´t always get what you want&quot; are classics. Brian Jones died during the recording of this album. Let´s review song by song:<br />1-&quot;Gimme shelter&quot;: One of the Stones best songs of all time. Nice lyrics and chorus, as well (10/10).<br />2-&quot;Love in vain&quot;: Perhaps the weakest song of the album, but even so, a good one. A bluesy ballad (7,5/10).<br />3-&quot;Country honk&quot;: A great song, but not as good as the others. A country version of &quot;Honky tonk woman&quot; (8,0/10).<br />4-&quot;Live with me&quot;: Another excellent song that features a nice chorus (9,5/10).<br />5-&quot;Let it bleed&quot;: Excellent song. Very fun and interesting (10/10).<br />6-&quot;Midnight rambler&quot;: A very good song, nothing special about it (10/10).<br />7-&quot;You got the silver&quot;: Sung by Keith. Another excellent song (9,5/10).<br />8-&quot;Monkey man&quot;: Wow! An excellent song, one of the Stones best. What else should I say? (20/10).<br />9-&quot;You can´t always get what you want&quot;: An amazing way to finish a masterpiece. Excellent lyrics and chorus (10/10).
0671027344|5.0|most beautiful book i've ever read. 1st book to ever make me cry.
B0000251VZ|4.0|If you are a true Maiden fan, you'll love this cd. It contains possibly the best instrumental piece ever (Losfer Words). If you're a true Maiden fan you should already have this cd or get it right away. &quot;Rimes of the Ancient Mariner&quot; is the best 13 minute song based on a poem (Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Coleridge). Powerslave is an essential cd for your collection. Every song is true Maiden from &quot;Aces High&quot; to &quot;Rimes of the Ancient Mariner&quot;. Possibly the best cd you could invest in.
B000099T2L|4.0|I like Beyonce's album even more after about 11 months later.  From &quot;Crazy In Love&quot;, &quot;Baby Boy&quot; and &quot;Naughty Girl&quot;, to the nine ballads that dominate the album, this is a solid effort from her.  I like how &quot;I'd Rather&quot; and &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot; weave so well back to back.  And the Missy Elliott-involved song about horoscope signs sounds very reflective.  Most dramatic is &quot;Speechless&quot; and how Beyonce belts it out during those 6 minutes! Most emotional is the song she dedicates to her father, &quot;Daddy.&quot;  It has been worthy of the many awards it has received this past year.  Fabulous singing, very musically done, this is a great album all throughout!
068484267X|5.0|I first read Angela's Ashes several years ago when i was in 7th grade, and instantly realized that i could never read another book again, because none would ever come close to the beauty and grace displayed in this memoir.  Although it sounds clich, i laughed, and at parts, cried, and found myself thanking god that this amazing man was born.
B000084T18|4.0|I liked 50 Cent's debut.  Warning, listen to it at your own caution despite the explicit lyrics.  This album is raw, his raps blend well with the different musics and beats and producers and he is just dynamite on the Dr. Dre-produced songs (even &quot;In Da Club&quot;). The ones that Eminem produced are just as solid too.  And his song &quot;21 Questions&quot; shows his softer side and pleasant compliments to the girl he's talking about on the song.  Better than hearing the heavy gun themes that dominate the album.  But his being from the streets justifies his stand in his songs' lyrics.  One of the best albums I heard during 2003.
0312995423|1.0|The worst part about this book is not that it is really predicitble but that it totally doesn't make sense. REALLY MR. BROWN STOP PATRONIZING US !!!! I think this author is one of the most overrated authors of all times!!!.
B00008ADPF|4.0|I didn't hear Silver Side Up, but I heard the hits from it.  I got to hear &quot;The Long Road&quot; and I was impressed.  Much better than the last one!  The writing and music are sharper this time!  And Chad Kroeger really is a better singer this time on the more challenging songs. Lots of rhythm this time in the rock!  They keep the songs short and to the same formula, but they definitely rock within the course of these 3- to 4-minute songs!
B0001GL3K4|4.0|Heartwarming is the most appropriate word to describe this movie. I first saw it in the cinema and I couldn't get the smile off my face afterwards. When I saw the DVD at the store I couldn't resist and I'm pleased to report that it has the same effect on repeat viewings.<br />The multiple storylines have the potential to disengage the viewer, yet terrific acting by the mammoth cast and director Richard Curtis' unashamed sentimentality leave you caring about each and every character, more so than some romantic comedies that focus on only one couple. My personal favourite is Liam Neeson's character, a widower bonding with his love-struck young stepson. Hugh Grant's prime minister also has an hilarious dancing scene after taking a stand against the US president (Billy Bob Thornton) (a pointless story arc, thrown in to demonstrate yet another form of love, this time patriotic). <BR>Not every story has a happy ending. Notably, those of the devoted sister (Laura Linney) torn between her mentally ill brother and her sexy co-worker and her boss (Alan Rickman), who may or may not be cheating on his wife (Emma Thompson).<br />The film is not without it's flaws. Some characters are less-than-endearing, such as Colin and his quest to get laid in America, yet they are not allowed enough screen time to truly irritate. The tenuous connections linking all the character are completely unbelievable, but somehow add to the film's charm.<BR>At times it seems like Curtis has tried to cram almost too much into the movie, and some storylines are poorer for it. Ultimately, however, the technique pays off. Any one of these storylines could have been made into an entire film, and it would have been just another formulaic Hollywood movie, this at least strives for some degree of originality in it's focus on a variety of relationships at various stages, rather than just two beautiful young things getting together. <br />I have heard this film criticised for being unrealistic, but it's a romantic comedy, what do you expect? It IS romantic and it IS funny, but it also has moments that 'real' people can relate to, like the pain of being in love with someone you can never have. If you want a dose of harsh reality, go watch a documentary, or the news. If you want a heartwarming, enjoyable piece of fluff that will make you believe, if only for the duration of the closing credits, that \\"love, actually is all around,\\" then you need to see this movie. Just don't make the mistake of taking it all too seriously.

038073186X|3.0|I just read Dennis Lehane's \\"Shutter Island\\". This is the kind of book that doesn't really need a book review: I think you know whether you like or don't like books about hospitals for the criminally insane on remote islands without reading a review. Generally, I can pass on them, but I was so impressed by Lehane's \\"Mystic River\\", which far surpassed the limitations of its genre, I thought I'd give this one a try. True, it's harder to surpass the limits of the hospital-of-the-criminally-insane genre; you pretty much have to have ex-Nazis and lobotomies. And Lehane *does* surpass the genre, although satisfaction level will vary from reader to reader.<br /><br />I have a few quibbles: I don't think people told how-many-x-does-it-take-lightbulb jokes back in 1954; that was an 80s phenomenon, and I'd believe it stretched back to the 70s, but no farther. I also don't think racial relations in the 1950's would allow the kind of black/white interplay that is necessary to the plot here. But these are minor complaints; the book stands or falls on your belief in the friendship between US Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule, and their interplay is beautifully rendered.<br /><br />Still, there's a major problem with the book, and it involves flounders. In the book, there are these rats that are symbolically necessary to the plot, and someone describes them as being \\"as big as a flounder\\". Now you or I know that rats are \\"as big as cats\\"; that's the only proper way to describe a big rat. But all the characters in this book are haunted by the sea. They are on a remote island, remember. Many had fathers who were fishermen. The sea is omnipresent. Hence: the rat was as big as a flounder.<br /><br />I don't know much about fish, but I do know that they never stop growing, so saying something is as big as a flounder is utterly meaningless. Plus, flounder are oval and flat. You'd have to hit a rat with a hammer and pound it before you could make a meaningful comparison to a flounder. On a remote island with a hospital for the criminally insane perhaps this could work if you had one of the inmates actually *pound* a rat. A guard could say \\"geez, that rat is as flat as a big flounder\\". But it wastes valuable time, and you need to be hurrying to the climactic scene where the hero breaks into the mysterious fenced-in lighthouse past the cemetary.<br /><br />Did I mention the hurricane? Yes, this is a remote-island-housing-a-hospital-for-the-criminally-insane-while-a-hurricane-rages kind of novel. You don't need a review to know if you'll like it kind or not. Anyway, at one point, the author describes the devastation: \\"A single flounder lay flapping and puffing in the breezeway, one sad swollen eye looking back toward the sea.\\"<br /><br />OK. Look. How on earth can you describe one eye of a flounder without describing the other? It's not possible. Unless..... YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT A FLOUNDER LOOKS LIKE. Unless you are bluffing your way through the whole haunted-by-the-sea business.<br /><br />Lehane is doing a lot of bluffing in this book, but he carries it off pretty well, Nazis, lobotomies, flounders and all.flounder. On a remote island with a hospital for the criminally insane perhaps this could work if you had one of the inmates actually *pound* a rat. A guard could say \\"geez, that rat is as flat as a big flounder\\". But it wastes valuable time, and you need to be hurrying to the climactic scene where the hero breaks into the mysterious fenced-in lighthouse past the cemetary.<BR> <BR>Did I mention the hurricane? Yes, this is a remote-island-housing-a-hospital-for-the-criminally-insane-while-a-hurricane-rages kind of novel. You don't need a review to know if you'll like it kind or not. Anyway, at one point, the author describes the devastation: \\"A single flounder lay flapping and puffing in the breezeway, one sad swollen eye looking back toward the sea.\\"<BR> <BR>OK. Look. How on earth can you describe one eye of a flounder without describing the other? It's not possible. Unless..... YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT A FLOUNDER LOOKS LIKE. Unless you are bluffing your way through the whole haunted-by-the-sea business.<BR> <BR>Lehane is doing a lot of bluffing in this book, but he carries it off pretty well, Nazis, lobotomies, flounders and all.
B000005J08|5.0|Okay, so why am I writing a review of this record so many years after it's release?  Well, It's because I just got into writing these reviews on amazon recently; that and maybe the hope of convincing someone to listen to this music for the first time.  <br />I really appreciate John Zorn.  I would say that I LOVE John Zorn, but the simple truth is I don't know the guy.  But I do know his music.  I haven't liked everything that he has done, but I have always appreciated the intent to realize a very personal and, often powerful, musical vision that pushes foward with exuberance and confidence.  He is a true visionary and innovator and I strongly encourage the purchase of any of this artist's work.  If you look into it, you will see that this prolific composer has recorded a whole world of music for you to discover.  This is just one great record, but do not, by any means, take this particular recording to be a representation of his body of work.<br />Onto &quot;Naked City.&quot;  For those that do not know, Naked City is a band, and that band's first record is self-titled.  John Zorn writes and/or arranges all of the pieces, as well as playing saxaphone along with Joey Baron (drums), Bill Frisell (Guitar), Wayne Horvitz (sp?) and Fred Frith (Bass).  Each of these musicians have solo careers and are composers in their own right, but have come together to help Zorn realize his distinct vision. <br />The styles touched on on this record include Surf Rock, Jazz (be-bop, straight-ahead, bossa, etc...), Rockabilly, Honkeytonk, Hardcore/Grindcore/Thrash, and a lot of other words that don't mean a whole lot.  Sometimes these styles all come together in one 30 second song.  Sometimes it is a bit like changing channels but, to my ears, these composistions all make perfect sense.  I think that &quot;Naked City&quot; is the perfect post-modern music.  It captures the organized chaos that is our everyday existence, and turns it into art.  There is a sardonic, cartoonish quality tothis music.  Zorn has claimed that Carl Stalling was a big influence.  But in Zorn's soundscape, the cynicism runs deep.  I can hear the ire in these pieces and in his own playing.  It is frenetic and at times abrasive, but it is also often very delicate.  Ten minutes of sporadic channel changing suddenly opens up into the piercing sincerity of the piece, &quot;Contempt&quot; in which Zorn sounds like he is trying to kill himself with his saxaphone - melodrama at it's best.<br />Well, I have embarrassed myself enough trying to describe this record.  I hope can influence someone to give it a try.  It does get very chaotic by the end, as the song titles get uglier, but the whole record makes a very strong statement the way it's layed out.  Sit back and surrender to the soundtrack of tomorrow - angrier, faster - chewin' it up and spittin' it out.  I have seen them live and it is is so much fun to watch guys like Joey Baron and Bill Frisell play this, often, violent music.  Joey Baron is just Mr. Smiley and Frisell is his usual overly reserved self.  <br />After you have listened to this one, check out &quot;Grand Guinol.&quot;  It starts off with beautiful arrangements of Debussy and Scriabin, and then ends with some of the most intense and ugly Hardcore you have ever heard.  Much of this music is impossible to describe so, give it a listen.
0312263120|5.0|As a longtime student of cryptanalysis I have always felt that the solving of codes and ciphers was fascinating, but I never expected to see it as the central element in a thriller so fast-paced and &quot;unputdownable&quot; that I literally found myself losing sleep to keep reading it.  Dan Brown is a master storyteller, there's no doubt about it.  It's no small trick to take something as intricate as cryptology and transform it into a page-turning delight, but Brown has done precisely that. Whatever your politics, whatever you think about organizations like the NSA, you're bound to get caught up in this splendid novel as soon as you pick it up.
B00018D44U|3.0|Norah plays more original music this time around, and the results are a beautiful, melodious album.  There is excellent, restrained playing here although I'm surprised they don't vary the tempos a little more.  Those who call it elevator music, though, just aren't listening.  There's a lot to recommend in Norah's sound.  Now to work on those lyrics . . .<br />And for Evan Mahaney (below), Robbie Williams isn't huge in the States because his music and singing are laughable.  He's ambitious, but ultimately a middle-of-the-pack talent.
0312263120|1.0|I found this book to be well researched, but it was like decorating an abandoned house with fine artwork. Every turn of the page had this combination of exquisite details hanging on the story structure of a harliquin romace. The heroine is supposed to be smart, strong, and beautiful - and yet she is also weak willed, sits at her computer for hours mooning over her boyfriend. She is the leader of a think tank, but cant effectively handle male sexual harrassment with anything other than ineffectual bad humor. She whines, she ignores the obvious clues to problems, and gets pulled along on an adventure that hinges on the very intellegence of her oh-so-convienently intellegent in just the right way handsome boyfriend. <br />Mr. Brown is so focused on her beauty, in fact, that he includes erronious details that have no effect on showing her as an intellegent being at all. He describes her dress, for example: her shirt is white and see through. She wears high heals in one chapter for emphasis on the look of her legs, and suddenly flats when its convienent for her to run. When she is attacked, its not as a threat to her life, but implies a rape waitng to happen aka: skirt bunched up arround her hips, or the wet t-shirt contest he forces upon her by the steam in the belly of the about to explode machine. He forces you to look at her as a sexualized creature, only incidentally indicating she is intellegent, but never actually allowing you to SEE this supposed intellegence. She is a facade. <br />Mr. Browns work research is extremely well done, but I came to his works to read a story, not a harlequin romance. If he intends to write more stories about 'strong' heroines, he needs to learn more about how women, and relationships, work before hanging such a masterpiece of research on such a shoddy structure of a storyline. I do not reccomend reading this.
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|Yep this is a bit like Fallen from five years ago. Fallen tried to do something and failed. Gothika tried the same thing and it worked. Halle Barry is the only person possessed throughout the whole movie and it has a psychological effect on her, and, throughout the course of the movie, the viewer is able to see the progression of her as a psychologist moving into the role of a being a mental patient. With Fallen, the possession of the soul moved too quickly and there were too many people that were possessed.
B00006CXXU|1.0|Trashy clothes and trashy music.  Yes, they do go together.  And I find her voice simply annoying!!! Christina, Christina, Christina--You are NOT Whitney Houston, nor will you ever sing like her. You have the worst singing voice---EVER!!!!<BR>  Please dye your hair back to its original blonde color!  I can't stand it being black! Put on more decent clothes than a stupid nightgown you bought at Victoria's Secret!!!!<BR>  And for God's Sake, please take out that damn nose ring!!!! You are NOT Janet Jackson!!!!<br /> Don't waste your money on this crap!!!! AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!!!!! SOMEBODY MAKE HER STOP!!!!! <BR>Bottom Line: Christina may be beautiful and a great singer no matter what they say, but my words CAN bring her down!!!!
B00005JL78|1.0|There isn't a movie that is half as bad as this. Enough said.
B0000640SA|5.0|Christopher Nolan makes a quirky offbeat film that has a catch.  You must be an experienced and seasoned film goer to appreciate and perhaps like it.      He laughs in the face of conventions and goes for broke.  What we get is a satisfying movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.
B00005T7I1|3.0|dustin hoffman played a retarded person in rain man and this movie. people must not think too highly of him.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's, Requiem for a Dream is brilliantly made.      Sound is used cleverly to amplify the destruction of the main characters.  Sure, we get a monster share of great dreamy visuals and some awesome special effects, but it is the sound FX that move us.     This film is edited in a way that you get the feeling that Aronofsky had a gun to his head while working on his Steinbeck.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|Before this album, I thought it impossible to put all of the Beatles best songs on to one album. Although this album was revolutionary, it has gaps.<br />The big one is Strawberry Fields Forever. This song made number in the US fair and square, and its other A-side Penny Lane is on here anyway. It should have been there instead of Eleanor Rigby. Plus, there aren't enough Lennon songs on here to reflect his full contribution to the band, especially later on. <br />An inclusion of another UK chart would have put Please Please Me on here. 30 weeks at #1 doesn't happen every day, but because Apple Records chose to use Record Retailer, Please Please Me would only count as a #2 single.<br />Only putting one Harrison song on there is an injustice. Unfortunately Here Comes the Sun wasn't a single and While My Guitar Gently Weeps didn't hit #1. But Old Brown Show, The Inner Light or For You Blue would have done fine.<br />A far more comprehensive, but more costly alternative would be the 52 song Red album and blue album. If you can't afford that, this album is lovely.
0316666343|4.0|Having also come from a small town where a murder of a teenage girl took place, I felt as if I was taking a front seat in this journey created by Sebold.  It starts off gut wrenching, and yet I could barely put it down.  You'll watch your children more closely after reading this novel, but don't think it is just about death and the evil mind of the killer, but about love and family and the delicate fabric of time that holds us either in this earthly plane or in Sebold's &quot;Inbetween.&quot;  I hope you enjoy your life too.
B00006690G|3.0|This is the first Eminem album I have, and this will be my last. I admit, I was completely blown away the first time I listened to this album. I thought this was the real bomb that I wanted to go out and buy all of his albums. Thank God I didn't. I played this album every day non-stop for about 1 month . And that is when I realize that it gets boring. Believe me, this album has a low replay value. You can play it about 20 times and then it gets boring. Believe me. It's nowhere near compared to such classics as \\"All Eyez on Me\\", \\"Me Against the World\\", \\"Ready to die\\", \\"Doggystyle\\" , \\"Chronic\\" etc. Those classics out there won't age even a single day and you can just play it over and over and over again to death. I really don't know what is so special about Eminem, why there are so many kids idolizing him. Sure his lyrics are really funny, but the funniness of it will just fade and disappear after you listened to the song about 5-10 times. Take for example the song \\"Criminal\\" (\\" So as I got older and I got a lot taller, my d**k shrunk smaller but my balls got larger\\"). First time I heard that, I almost choked from laughing. But after just couple more listens, I didn't find it funny anymore. Same thing can be said with \\"Without Me\\", \\"Drips\\", \\"Real Slim Shady\\", \\"My Name Is\\" just to name a few.  Sure Eminem is really good, no question `bout that, but he is not THAT good. I can honestly say that there are a bunch of rappers out there who are more talented and better than Eminem (Kurupt, Daz, DJ Quik, Krayzie Bone, Big L, to name a few). From my point of view, I think the reasons why Eminem sold millions of albums is because he is white and he is backed up by Dr. Dre (just like 50 cent). Eminem said so himself in \\"White America\\" (\\"Let's do the math. If I was black, I would've sold half\\"). Another thing, I wonder why Eminem disses female pop artists like Britney and Christina when they are out of his league and they have done nuthin' against him. I don't mind if Eminem disses f*gg*t boybands and male pop artist cause they deserved to be dissed anyway. But dissing females like Britney and Christina is going too far. No wonder why Christina Aguilera retaliates back and makes his own version of \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" entitled \\"Will The Real Slim Shady Please Shut Up\\" (You gotta listen to this, she completely destroys Eminem here \\"Even his girlfriend cheated on him, Look at him walking around, livin' off Dre, acting so cool but he's really kinda weak though\\"). Eminem should be ashamed of himself because he is completely destroyed by a female pop artist. Hey, don't get me wrong, I'M NOT A HATER but I'm not a fan either, I'm just telling the truth. Anyway, highlights on this album are the 2nd single, and the best song on the album,  \\"Cleaning out my closet\\". This is got to be Em's most personal and heartfelt song where he completely diss his own mama. This is the exact opposite of 2paC's \\"Dear Mama\\". Could you believe it that here in our place, a local lawmaker even tried to ban this particular song on the airwaves because it provokes hate towards our own mama. Next is \\"Till I collapse\\", this got to be one of Em's best song. I wonder why it didn't become a single. Nate's hook on this is really good. \\"Sing for the Moment\\" is the third single to come out. It deserves to be a single as Em talks about his critics and how the media treats him badly. The first single \\"Without me\\" is gotta be the worst song on the album. I just don't like commercial songs. \\"Drips\\" ft. his protégé Obie Trice is either funny or disgusting depending of what type of person you are. I find it funny at first especially Obie's verse but now it's kind of really disgusting. \\"Superman\\" is somewhat funny where he talks about how b*****s just come and go. Here is a breakdown to all the tracks rated from 1-5 (5 being the highest.)<br />1. intro<BR>2. White America - (2/5)<BR>3. Business - (3/5) I like it at first, but it really grows old fast<BR>4. Cleaning Out My Closet - (5/5)<BR>5.  Square Dance - (2/5) Another one of those stupid songs similar to Without Me<BR>6. Skit<BR>7. Soldier - (4.5/5) A track where Eminem just rips the mic apart similar to that of \\"The Way I Am\\"<BR>8. Say Goodbye to Hollywood - (3.5/5)<BR>9. Drips - (3/5) Either funny or disgusting depending on what type of person you are<BR>10. Without Me - (1/5) Very catchy tune and funny at first, but gets boring. <BR>11. Skit<BR>12. Sing for The Moment - (5/5)<BR>13. Superman - (4/5)<BR>14. Hailie' Song - (4/5) I actually liked this especially Em's 3rd verse<BR>15. Skit<BR>16. When the Music Stops - (3.5/5)<BR>17. Say What u Say - (3/5) a diss to Jermaine Dupri<BR>18. Till I Collapse - (5/5)<BR>19. My Dad's Gone Crazy - (2/5) another 1 of those stupid songs, a diss to his mama<BR>20. Outro<br />So here it is the complete breakdown of all the tracks. If I were you I would just download the great songs (Cleaning Out My Closet, Till I Collapse, Sing For the Moment, Soldier, Superman) because the album really gets boring in a long run. Believe me. If I were you, I won't waste my money buying Eminem albums and instead invest in some great music.<BR>[!] PEACE [!]
B00003CXCT|1.0|Don't give any more money to this man.  Buy the used digitally remastered VHS version of the original trilogy.  It looks and sounds great and doesn't have any of those added on special effects.
B00002SSKI|4.0|i think this movie is really good. and the casting is good too. i really like everything about it especially when the girls are younger discovering heaps of stuff and growing up \, talking about all the things teen girls talk about. so i think this is definitely a girl movie. go see it u will love it.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|Joe Manco is his name, or at least a best guess, in the first movie the undertaker and bartender both call him Joe, generic? maybe. In the second film Col Mortimer is told by the town sherrif that another man was interested in the bounty on a wanted man, The Sherrif says he goes by &quot;Manco&quot; indicating Clint.
B00006BTCA|4.0|I dont know how old Banks is,though he looks around 18,with all of the characteristics of his voice,you would think he was no more than thirty five.I could never believe that lyrics could be so relative yet witty,literal,and comprehensive.What really hooked me about that is that it isn't meant to be directed at the younger crowd.The songs express negative feelings in cleverness and sarcasm.Even with a seemingly content atomsphere,you can tell that whats trying to be transitioned is something like frustration.They're really quite genius with that.<br />I do warn the close-minded.If you purchse Turn on the Bright Lights,you might be somewhat disappointed if you expect a similar sound to that of PDA and Obstacle 1.There are a few that are fast-paced super indie tunes like Say Hello... and Roland,but the majority are quite melodic and there for the purpose of creating an atmosphere,and telling a story.But after a few listens,you're really appreciate the creative uniqueness of each.To describe the sound,I'd say a cross between The Doors and the Chemical Brothers.Also,pretty much all of the songs describe past and present relationships.And though most songs about love are pretty mundane,Interpol makes each one very different and specific.And most of the time,pretty damn weird.<br />Though this doesn't seem like the most positive review,I'd definitely recommend buying this CD for anyone who wants to own a peice of a hopeful music revolution.This whole review is just a warning for those who don't.
B00004XOWM|2.0|Edit:<br />Ok, I give this 2 stars for the number of good songs: &quot;Boiler&quot; and &quot;Take A Look Around&quot;. All other songs here are bad.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|This movie was very insightful into the life of a greedy yet lovable brother and a mental patient at the physc ward with an IQ of 176. The movie mainly focuses on the relationship between Hoffman and Cruise, who make a strong bond after Cruise heard of his father's death and wasn't left a penny, instead leaving over $3 million with Hoffman. The story takes place in various places of the West Coast, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. The story is very unique, great that made this movie win an oscar, but the main thing is the acting Hoffman produces which is so real, so touching, that it made this movie so believeable, not just a shelf throw back. 10/10.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Wow.  This entire CD is great for venting out anger.<br />&quot;Adam's Song&quot; is the best one on the record.  It's not the fastest song, but it slowly relaxes you with its alternating rhythms.  <br />Overall, though, it makes you wanna get up and dance.  That's why this is the best CD of late-90's alt-punk.  Buy this record without reservations.
B00000GAIW|5.0|Not only is this a fantastic Jethro Tull album, but it is simply a fantastic Rock n' Roll album. The guitar-driven songs which everyone has heard hundreds of times, still sound new and original today. Despite Classic Rock stations across the country who play Aqualung, Cross-Eyed Mary, Locomotive Breath and Hymn 43 only, there are more songs here to enjoy. \\"Mother Goose\\" is a catchy little song that will keep you humming. \\"My God\\" is another fantastic tune, and a tune that only Ian Anderson could write. There is good reason why Aqualung pushed Tull to the forefront of the music scene in the 70's. Like \\"Van Halen\\", \\"Sgt. Peppers\\", \\"Back In Black\\", \\"Aqualung\\" is an essential CD for your rock collection. Once you put Aqualung on your CD player I guarantee it will stay there for days, and will stay even longer in your head!!
B00000I2UC|4.0|This cd is great, I got into JAMC thru the video for 'Head On', and I bought the cd, and its great!! If you like some 80's dance beats you'll like this, although its really different then Pyschocandy, this is a great album. Songs like: Here comes alice, Blues from a gun, Between planets, Head on, Half way to crazy arr all amazing tracks. It's a shame this is an import though. I'm now buying the BBC Live cd. it's cool to hear the songs without their drum machine drummers...
B00005QZ7U|1.0|&quot;I've got a great idea for a movie! It'll be a musical, with MTV sensibilities...jump cuts, frantic camerawork and get this... it'll utilize period inappropriate music...modern pop music in 1900 Paris.&quot; <BR>This movie will find a place in the &quot;Worst conceived musical&quot; section in the local video store next to 1978's &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; It may well become a camp / cheeze classic but friends...the emperor has no clothes.<br />Avoid
B00005JKCH|5.0|This movie had great special effects, and the story was interesting.  This will be a clasic like Star Wars.
0743454529|5.0|As a parent you wonder how far you would go to save your child, and at what cost to other family members. I would give up my life for my child, but would I give up another one of my children to save one? This is the choice Sara had to make to continually go from one health emergency to another with her daughter Kate. During Kates life threateneing moments, it was Anna, her sister conceived just to give Kate the cells that she needed to survive must also go through evasive medical procedures. How far do you go as a parent, to save a child? Jodi Picould wties a page turner filled with the unexpected in exploring this issue. When is enough - enough. Who can say stop taking from one child and let the other child go. A topic that will have a defferent opinion from anyone who has read this compelling book. Each chapter is another character talking about their perspective and how the decisions that will be made, will effect them. Don't miss this book - and don't read the last 20 pages in a public place, it will take your breath away.
B0001US8FI|5.0|Talk about martial arts and you are sure to hear Bruce Lee's name mentioned. The 20th century icon so tragically cut down before his true potential was realized (and even before this movie was released) has gained almost immortal status, over the last 30 years. This movie was the jewel in his filmaking crown, and paved the way for countless stars since. What I liked particularly however was the number of indepth and interesting extra's on the DVD set. There is some cross referring, as a lot of these documentaries and commentaries have been individually released previously but this is a great complete package. Often referred to as &quot;one of a kind&quot; in his area of expertise, for me at least he will always be - often imitated, never equalled. 5 Stars all the way.
B00003CXCT|4.0|You know, I don't really mind all the digital rework of these films. I know that people hold the originals sacred, but, hey, even the Bible was edited. So this bit of man-made fiction has the same right to tinkering as everything else.<br />I think George should have probably left cloud city and the desert alone, and put all his time into fixing episode 6 - the series finale/let-down. George, just make up your mind what you are trying to say, and then reshoot the whole thing without the teddy bears. Do it all with digital actors, and make us truly feel it.
B000069AUI|5.0|To borrow the words of Brad Nowell, good music is good music and that should be enough for anyone. Coldplay mades good music, I believe they make great music. Everyone has an influence, even Pink Floyd. So what if Coldplay allowed Pink Floyd and Radiohead to influence their music, i'm glad they did. As a lover and maker of music, I myself understand that without inspiration music would die. So, don't let those who tell you Coldplay is just a (...) band scare you off, because they are much much more than that. They bring their own individual flair to the genre pink floyd and radiohead may have created, and manage to create some of the most beautiful and inspiring music being put out today. Anyone with the remotest bit of TRUE musical appreciation would be able to lisen to Coldplay and admit the band has talent, even if the style didn't happen to be their cup of tea. All I know is I bought this cd the day after it came out due to a friend's recomendation, have listened to it countless times since, and have never failed to be somewhat awed by it.
B0000C8AW7|5.0|Like caviar and oysters perhaps this recording is an acquired taste...and it needs several hearings to fully appreciate, after which it becomes addictive; it has a down-home Mississippi muddy feel that makes it Dylan's grittiest album, and one of my favorites. His voice sounds like freshly poured gravel, adding to its charm and old time blues quality.<br />The musicianship is extraordinary: Larry Campbell is fabulous on guitar, violin, banjo and mandolin, as is Charlie Sexton on guitar, Tony Garnier on bass, Augie Meyers on organ and accordion, and David Kemper will knock your socks off on drums.<br />The songs are melodic and words poetic and powerful. The CD insert is a single sheet fold-out, so does not include the lyrics, but they are worth searching out to read and relish the brilliance, see the light and darkness, hope and affliction, and the balance of humor. &quot;Po' Boy&quot; even has a knock knock joke:<br />Knockin' on the door,<br />I say &quot;who is it and where are you from ?&quot;<br />Man says &quot;Freddy !&quot;<br />I say &quot;Freddy who ?&quot;<br />He says, &quot;Freddy or not, here I come&quot;.<br />There is greatness in this CD, even though it might not seem so with casual listening. Plumb the depths and it will reward you. Total playing time is 57'30.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|If you like historically accurate adventure movies, this one is for you. Be prepared, though, for favorite characters to die and for an unusual twist at the end. Russel Crowe portrays Capt. \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey, who's been given orders to take down a larger and more powerful French warship, and by gosh, he's gonna do it, even with a disabled ship and inexperienced crew. One warning to parents: there are some bloody scenes probably not totally appropriate to young children. Again, this is historically accurate; this is how it was in those days!
B00008J4P5|4.0|There's an elephant in the room.  You must have heard of him by now.  If the rumors are true and rock `n' roll has, in fact, died a slow death, he wants to resurrect it. He plays blues the way country should sound and plays country the way blues should sound.  You put him on a pedestal and he escapes, not wanting to suffer the limitations of rock journalist-dictated labels, but instead, practices putting his brilliance to good use and bringing the new Loretta Lynn album into the world.  He makes a cameo in a Civil War-themed melodrama...and he fools you into believing that he actually belongs there.  He gets in a fight with the lead singer of a band trying to hop on the &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; bandwagon...let's just say that anyone who caught a fleeting glimpse of the poor, almost unidentifiable victim in Spin knows that the Von Bondies lead singer dude really got a pummeling from Mr. Jack White of the White Stripes, whose album, Elephant, is essentially unavoidable in its power, scope, and focus, more so than its predecessor, White Blood Cells. If you believe in rock `n' roll's ability to survive in the 21st century, deep within the guitar solo in &quot;Ball and Biscuit,&quot; you can find proof that Clapton really was a deity, Robert Johnson really did sell his soul to the Devil, and Beatles really were bigger than Jesus.  <br />In case you've forgotten, spirituality CAN still live in music, and it doesn't have to be Al Green gospel or come from a sitar strummed by Shiva.  To put it simply, music elicits emotional and philosophical responses and teaches lessons about life in the same way as a story about men (or Gods, depending on your perspective) who could turn water into wine and find the middle way through meditation.  It just might not be on such a large scale.  Instead of immortal, almighty, and omniscient, the meager spirit of the White Stripe's Elephant strives to evoke the beauty of human confusion.  You can't build a religion around the mind's tendency to cloud up and wonder in circles, but you can build a brilliant album that celebrates (rather than simulates) the ghosts of blues-rock's past.<br />Below you'll find, in list form, four songs to savor:<br />1. You endure the millionth official listen of modern rock radio veteran \\"Seven Nation Army\\" in order to treasure that moment of tranquility that passes like a painful blinking eye before \\"Black Math.\\"  The song is hiding in the wings, just waiting to come out, and when it takes the stage with a vengeance, its manic depressive chords slash the silence like dual Medieval swords.  As Jack White channels his inner Jimmy Page (circa 1969), you can hear the eerie echoes of \\"Communication Breakdown\\" driving you insane.  Solos come out from behind lyrics, mimicking the utter confusion of the words wailed into oblivion.  Understanding what this song is really about would dismiss its nature, which is essentially a maze of misunderstanding.  The lyrics are filled with \\"maybes\\" and question marks, each leading to bigger lakes and oceans of \\"maybes\\" and question marks. <br />2. How low are you when the ring tone of your lover's telephone can appease your loneliness?  Set against the backdrop of desperate steroid chords, \\"Hypnotize\\" is simultaneously a sweet and tender country song on paper, so sweet and tender that you can't help wondering whether this is the first punk-influenced song to express lasting, monogamous romantic intentions.  \\"I want to hold your little hand, if I may be so bold...and be your right hand man `till your hands get cold.\\"  Put this on the list of songs to play at your wedding.  <br />3. Most buttonholes are created with the intention of making it easy as possible for the button to slide through.  Are buttons ever hard to button?  What's that, you say?  When you're drunk?  The last button on your coat before you leave a bar totally tossed?  The very button you wish someone could button up for you, if you weren't all alone?  With that context outof the way, it's difficult to pinpoint how the baby boy with his toy and toothache fit into the mix; however, all this pretension about \\"The Hardest Button to Button\\" being a song about hard time family livin' erodes when Jack starts in on one of the great recent rants of rock.  Beginning with \\"well, it's easy, when you don't know better,\\" you realize that it may be folly to analyze and think about life too much.  Maybe life IS easier when you don't know about Marxist theory...when you don't know about the imminent danger of global warming...when you don't know about the threat of nuclear and biological weapons...when you're happily ignorant and closed minded.  \\"But there's just something wrong with you.  Just feel like you're the hardest button to button.\\"  The tragedy of knowing too much is confusion...not knowing how to put it to use socially, politically, and/or psychologically.  \\"I had opinions that didn't matter.  I had a brain that felt like pancake batter.\\"  This is not lazy, passive confusion.  It's desperate confusion locked inside a long dormant volcano, ready to blow any second.  It's the confusion of trying to button a button while alone and drunk, or worse, attempting to button a button through a hole that simply doesn't exist.<br />\\"You've Got Her in Your Pocket\\" is a quiet acoustic song that juxtaposes two opposite relationship extremes, bringing about more puzzlement in a peaceful setting.  The act of putting a loved one in your pocket is eloquently obvious enough as far as imagery goes, but there are implications.  On one hand, \\"there's no way out, now,\\" so you're feeling trapped, suffocated.  On the other hand, \\"put it in the safe and lock it, `cause it's home, sweet home\\" advocates protecting the union from outside influences beyond your control.  \\"What to do?\\" the lyrics wonder.  If you haven't asked yourself that question, you haven't been in love.
B00008ADPF|4.0|Rock is simply not it's best these days. However, among the few who are always good on their follow up albums, Nickelback has released yet another successful, rockout cd. If you are a fan of Nickelback, this is perfect for you, and if not, this is still a good release. It's not Silver Side Up, or The State, but it is perfect for your collection.
B000060P79|1.0|This band is a mockery of the punk rock genre.  I know people say their songs are catchy and infectious but they really aren't.  Blink-182 were making goofball records for years until their most recent, more mature, new album was released.  Even they know that they had to get out of the gutter before every teenager around the world became obsessed with fart jokes and midgits.  Other bands like Sum 41 and The Starting Line at least have the gusto in their live show to make up for their lack of studio prowess.  Unfortunately, Simple Plan aim way low on maturity scale lyrically and musically.  Songs range from irritating to flat out obnoxious.  C'mon people.  Get your head out of your asses.  Buy a Buzzcocks or Clash album.  Hell, just buy an Offspring album over this piece of crap.  I'm only one man with an opinion.  But music like this is destined only to fade away and never be remembered again.
B000060MMI|5.0|I heard about Flogging Molly when a friend of mine's band played a few of their songs for a show they were doing. I was interested, so I picked this cd up. Let me say that my friend's band does not do justice. Flogging Molly is one of the best things I've heard in years. This cd is worth it. It's a must for Celtic or Punk lovers.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|sup maggots this is the best slipknot cd of them all!<BR>If you are a slipknot maggot you should really buy this album.<BR>Great druming and really really good solos!<BR>if you liked the old slipknot this will blow your minds, dont worry you will still love this album.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Meet Donnie, a pessimistic 16-year-old schizophrenic (aptly played by Jake Gyllenhaal). One night Donnie hears a voice call to him, he gets out of bed and walks to a nearby golf course where he meets Frank, a six-foot-tall rabbit. &quot;28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds. That is when the world will end,&quot; Frank tells Donnie. Donnie awakes on the golf course and walks home. It turns out a jet engine fell from the sky and smashed into his room. No one knows where it came from.<br />Donnie Darko has every movie genre rolled into one. It contains the sarcastic wit of a comedy, the thought-provoking elements of a psychological thriller, the scientific edge of a sci-fi film...<br />What made this film one of my favorites was the fact that I was pondering it weeks afterward. My friends and I would discuss several different possibilities for why the way it ended the way it ended. Though I never quite got it until I watched the commentary on the DVD with the director, Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal, which is very humorous as well as informative to the aspect of the 4th dimension in the movie.<br />As for DVD extras, they are not disappointing. There are several quite relevant deleted scenes that include a scene in which Donnie's psychiatrist tells him that his pills to treat his schizophrenia are placebos as well as an alternate (more gory) alternate ending.<br />Overall, this movie is one of the most inventive and groundbreaking films of the last ten years, if not more.
0312995423|2.0|I thought this book would be a good thriller and for a while it was.The author has constructed the book using a series of 2 or3 page chapters .The chapters jump from character to character with each chapter having a suspensfull ending.This system works for a while but after a while this gets a bit dull and there is very little character development. The book gets boring and eventually I didn't care about any of the characters or how the book ended.The book started on a high note but quickly went down hill.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|First of all, I want to say this CD is ridiculously good. I had multiple eargasms listening to it. Avenged Sevenfold are and classify themselves as a band that has no particular genre, so don't go and say ohh they try to copy Poison the Well or there Beautiful Mistake wannabes. No no YOU'LL be making a mistake thinking these guys suck because they just don't. They have it all riffs, mixed vocals, ludicrous solos, passionate lyrics.<br />Waking the Fallen-9/10<BR>this is a great intro that gets you ready and pumped for the next 70 minutes of great music.<br />Unholy Confessions-9/10<BR>this song sounded weird at first, but make no mistake it WILL grow on you and you WILL love it. It is more or less a &quot;precursor&quot; of what to expect with the rest of the cd.<br />Chapter Four-10/10<BR>great song period. has everything in it that i come to enjoy about Avenged Sevenfold.<br />Remenissions-10/10<BR>this has its violent, and I mean pretty violent, to its more laid back vocals with acoustic churning out catchy emo like lyrics. Great song.<br />Desperate Through Reverance-9/10<BR>good good song.<br />Eternal Rest-9/10<BR>typically great song.<br /> Second Heartbeat-9/10<BR>ditto.<br />Radiant Eclipse-9/10<BR>starts off with a chainsaw crazy guitar sound then they collect their senses and churn a great song.<br />I Won't See You Tonight - Part 1-9/10<br />I Won't See You Tonight - Part 2-9/10<br />Clairvoyant Disease-10/10<BR>great song. just buy the damn cd.<br />And All Things Will End-100/100<BR>because of the guitar solo at the end. Great song and with the guitar solo that proggresively get slower its great.<br />Just get the CD.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Since when did these reviews became a posting board for disgruntled fans? George Lucas created these films, and owes nothing to the fans who have spent twenty years (ever since ROJ) talking about how they would have done it differently.<br />I have been waiting for these DVD's to come out since I got my first player. I do not own the special edition versions of the three films and only saw them in the theaters. The enhancements were in no way distracting, even if they did not add a lot of value to the originals.<br />As for a review, these films need none. Their cultural impact is unquestioned and unequaled. I will buy these films without regret and spend weeks watching them again and again.
630521610X|5.0|I love to be on the edge of my seat, watchin a movie, with popcorn, in the dark. Its scary and a load of fun. This movie is one of my FAVORITE scary/horror/comedy/thriller movies ever!! I luv it!!Rent it and then buy it!!
0345440900|1.0|This book had a couple helpful things in it, but overall I was annoyed by her lack of objectivity (while pretending like she was presenting an unbias view). And I did find her tone condescending.   I have had a lot of sleepless nights in the past 6 weeks which has given me a great opportunity to fly through baby care books. I have to say that I lean toward books written by doctors or sleep researchers that back up their suggestions with actual data and research.  I am a total sucker for science and long bibliographies, and that is what I did not find in this book- just opinion.  And sure her opinion will work fine for some babies, but some of her methods are potentially harmful (see other reviews for details).  I found her E.A.S.Y. program to be meaningless- Eat Activity Sleep You- whatever!  She kept referring to it like it was the meaning of life.   <BR>I find it quite amusing that she appropriated the &quot;the ABC's of operant conditioning&quot;.  She calls it her the &quot;ABCs of Changing Bad Habits&quot;.  I would have respected her more if she had admitted this was borrowed from learning theory and behavioral psychology instead of pretending like she invented it.  She uses the same terms (Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence), but she totally misinterprets how it works. Instead of the common behavioral wisdom (change the consequence to change the behavior- brought to us courtesy of Skinner 50+ years ago and still valid), she says &quot;Change the behavior to change the consequence&quot;.  But how do you introduce a new behavior?  She doesn't touch on that- her ABCs make no sense and just confirmed for me what I had suspected- that she skimmed books instead of doing real research.
0224064533|5.0|This was a great book. After i read it i decided to do it for my school book report. I think this is a great book to do a book report for school because its easy to read and its just a great book.I think the kids that read this book get smart.<br />I love this book and Ryan Thomas(this kid from bellefonte thats really hot!!)
B0000X61UU|5.0|This is a strong workout.  Don't be put off by the fact that it is a model doing the routine.  My boyfriend watched some of what I was doing and decided he would try it too.  It worked him good and he claims he will do it every week now.  It's thorough, too the point and doesn't waste your time.  You get a good hour of strength and cardio all around.  This is not whimpy fluff that has you moving around, but not really concentrating on strengthing your muscle groups (if that's what you want, don't get this).  And to top all that off, Cindy is a pleasant person to be around, with a soothing and real demeanor. Plus the setting, editing and music is qualilty.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I'll be part of this review chain and say it's a good album as many others did. There's nothing wrong with it - well only one flaw, and that is &quot;they are unoriginal.&quot; I hear that from many people. But take originality aside because the music will entertain you! Who's to say what really is orignal this era of music? Music today is practically made up of a lot of influences from music of the past. The only original thing that can come out of music really are bands and artists fusing genres.<br />and anyway, I recommend you get this album! It's fun catchy poppy rock. Every song is good. Believe me! Get Room on Fire too!
B000000XB9|4.0|They managed to put together 20 good, very good, or great songs with this greatest hits album. This is the perfect album for a casual RockNRoll fan, if they want to own some CCR. Covering songs like, &quot;Fortuanate Son, &quot;Bad Moon Rising,&quot; and &quot;Down On The Corner,&quot;  and also giving you hits like, &quot;Down On The Corner,&quot; and &quot;I Heard It Through The Grapevine,&quot; and throwing in less widely know songs like, &quot;Who'll Stop The Rain?, my personal favorite, this is as close to a complete collection as it could be. This album many great songs.<br />Basically, this is the perfect Greatest Hits album for a band like CCR. It is exactly what a greatest hits album should be. Get it, if you don't have it.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I could describe this film, but it would never do it justice. No matter what you read, when you actually see this movie, it will be TOTALLY different then what you were expecting. My father explained it to me a few years before I finally watched it, and it sounded very dumb, not at all interesting, but when I saw the film,  it was far different and far better then I EVER thought it would or could be based on others descriptions of it.  No matter what you read about this film, it will still probably be different than you thought it would be in your head when you actually sit down and watch it.<br /><br />  \\"Donnie Darko\\" is part science fiction, part drama, part comedy, part teen movie, part satire, its so many things in one, its hard to describe, and it can't be lumped  into to one category. It is at times hilarious, to where I couldn't stop laughing, at other points, so sad I cried, and other times it had me shaking my head because it hurt trying to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.  No matter how many times I watch it, I feel this way.<br /><br />  One of the best things in this film is the interplay between Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal, it is hilarious to watch them at times, and you can see the chemistry between them.  Everyone in the cast is spot on, there is not a bad performance in the bunch, from the gleefully obnoxious performances by Beth Grant, to the sweet and sad performance of Jena Malone to the smarmy self-help guy Patrick Swayze plays, everybody is fantastic.<br /><br />  With a fantastic script, a great cast, and some awesome 80's music, Donnie Darko is one of the most iconic movies of the 2000's, and has stood the test of time well over the last 10yrs (1/26/13) and will continue to do so.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy
B0000004V2|5.0|I've read some of the above reviews, and for those who have criticized the album as bland and unremarkable, I can honestly say that I said the exact same thing when I first heard it.  My friend gave me his Walkman (yes, this was back in 1989) and begged me to listen to what he described as the greatest band EVER!  I listened to Waterfall (track 4) and concluded that it sounded repetitive and unassuming.  Dull, in fact.<br />But, a few months later, I wouldn't take this tape out of my cassette deck, as it had become my favourite record of all time, period.  It still holds that status today.  The strange thing about this album is that it GROWS on you, and it takes some repeated listening to; some of the greatest albums ever have this odd characteristic (e.g., Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\").  It won't grab you right away like a Michael Jackson LP - it's much more subtle and complex than that.  <br />Listen to it intently, without distraction, and with a good stereo, and be amazed at Johnny Squire's incredibly deft, hooky and shimmering guitar work, Ian Brown's inspiring, defiant and intelligent lyrics, Reni's funky, polyrhythmic and almost freestyle drumming, Mani's uniquely groovy bass playing, and the astonishing complexity with which they tied it all together.  Most bands don't attain this level of technical and creative ability after releasing five studio albums, and this was the Roses' debut.  <br />It takes a careful ear to recognize the genius at work here in this album, but with a little bit of effort, you'll discover the magic of an album that will keep you humming its melodies for a lifetime.

Great for the kids, not! Gee if he is really supportave and respectfull can she keep her job after the wedding? Right.

0790725657|4.0|&quot;A Little Princess&quot; is a fine film for both adults and children. It is visually stunning, for a start, and its music and lighting create many magical images. The plot hews quite closely to the classic F.H. Burnett novel, in which young Sarah Crewe is left at a New York boarding school while her father goes off to World War I. The school is run by the hard-nosed Miss Minchin (expertly played by Eleanor Bron), who, upon learning that Sarah's father is presumed dead, turns Sarah into an impoverished servant. Like most of Burnett's great stories, this one pits one optimistic, winning child against the overwhelming odds of a harsh world. Sarah's ability to bring joy to the other girls she meets builds her a powerful support network, and in the end her triumph is tremendously moving. The film is forced to rely on the acting abilities of many small girls, but they all do their best and overall are engaging. As I say, the cinematography is first rate, and, having seen this film three times, I find I am always glad to have watched it.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I have to admit that I had very low expectations of this album.  I haven't been impressed with anything Rocafella had put out lately, including the last couple Jay Z albums, before the Black Album.  I was very pleasantly surprised though.  This is about the least typical Rocafella album ever, almost no guns and ice at all.  The college dropout theme gets a little redundant at times but definately a must have.
0553293397|4.0|Isaac Asimov returned to his &quot;Robot&quot; tales for &quot;The Naked Sun,&quot; a taut murder mystery wrapped in a heavy sci-fi cloak. If anything, &quot;Naked Sun&quot; is more imaginative and tightly-written than the previous novel, &quot;Caves of Steel,&quot; with its unconventional detecting and seemingly unsolvable crime.<br />Cop Elijah Baley isn't too fond of robots. Or Spacers. So he's less than pleased when he is sent to Solaria, a sparsely populated world where robots do all the work, and humans &quot;toil not, neither do they spin.&quot; He's there to investigate a strange murder -- a scientist named Delmarre was murdered, and his widow Gladia is the only possible suspect. But she seems too ditzy and fluttery to crush a person's skull.<br />When an official is poisoned right in front of Baley, his suspicions are confirmed -- somebody is still murdering, and it may be linked to some touchy political subjects that Delmarre was working on. No human was close enough to kill either man, and no robot was capable of murder. With the assistance of his robot sidekick R. Daneel Olivaw, Lije Baley starts to unravel a mystery that seems to have no suspects...<br />Does a world full of languid, long-lived people waited on by robots sound like paradise? It won't after &quot;Naked Sun,&quot; where such a civilization is enough to drive you nuts with boredom. Asimov did an excellent job with the Solarian civilization, where actually being in the same room as another person is considered an unspeakable intimacy and the world &quot;children&quot; is almost obscene.<br />Since this is all completely foreign to Lije Bailey (who comes from overcrowded Earth), it comes across as alien to the readers as well. It also adds an enticingly weird dimension to his detective work: Bailey has to solve a mystery entirely through communication equipment, and robots keep clearing away evidence. Add some agoraphobia and solid social commentary, and you have a story that is reminiscent of Agatha Christie writing Star Wars.<br />Bailey and Daneel make an excellent team -- there's Bailey's human gut feelings and intuitions into the human mind, coupled with Daneel's cool calm robot logic, and his lack of prejudices. The supporting characters are also nicely done, particularly the mildly neurotic Gladia and the nervous Gruer.<br />Asimov's &quot;Naked Sun&quot; is a tighter, tauter mystery than &quot;Caves of Steel,&quot; with a bizarre civilization and a mystery that seems impossible to figure out. Immensely enjoyable and thought-provoking.of Agatha Christie writing Star Wars.<br />Bailey and Daneel make an excellent team -- there's Bailey's human gut feelings and intuitions into the human mind, coupled with Daneel's cool calm robot logic, and his lack of prejudices.

B000002AZ8|4.0|If only Pearl Jam had decided to drop two or three songs, this could be a five-star album. As it is, it's a great album full of some of their very best songs. Here's a song-by-song breakdown:<br />1. Last Exit -- A great way to start the album, with some cool tinkering at the beginning. 9/10<BR>2. Spin the Black Circle -- A bit of a melodramatic ode to vinyl (it's not a drug, Eddie), but it rocks and it gets the blood pumping. 8/10<BR>3. Not For You -- I love this song. It's one you can get into screaming along to. Also, during the &quot;All that's sacred . . .&quot; section, the dynamics are awesome. 10/10<BR>4. Tremor Christ -- Good song. The rhthym is awesome, and though the drums are really nothing fancy, they drive the song. However, it seems to be lacking something to me. 7.5/10 <BR>5. Nothingman -- Not the best of their ballads (that's yet to come) but the words are good (and they're by Jeff Ament, which is cool) and it's a pretty song to listen to when you're just in a melancholy mood. 8/10<BR>6. Whipping -- I recently came to really like this song. It makes you want to rock again after the slow &quot;Nothingman.&quot; I like the live version better, but this is good too. 9/10<BR>7. Pry, To -- I don't have anything good or bad to say about it, I guess . . . it's only a minute long, so while it is self-indulgent filler, at least it's short and harmless.7/10<BR>8. Corduroy -- AWESOME song. It's got a hook that'll stay in your head for days, and the words break my heart -- &quot;I'll end up alone like I began.&quot; Some are turned off by Eddie's whining about the pressures of fame, but I don't mind it if he's able to turn it into a song as great as this. 10/10<BR>9. Bugs -- Umm . . . yeah. I wouldn't mind it if it were short like &quot;Pry, To,&quot; but this is nearly three minutes long. You can only take so much. I'm all for bands experimenting, but Eddie Vedder talking with an accordion playing in the background is just not necessary. 4/10 (the lyrics are at least somewhat introspective)<BR>10. Satan's Bed -- I really like this song. Supposedly it's an answer to people who accused Eddie Vedder of devil-worshiping. That's why I find it amusing, and besides that, just a cool song. 8/10<BR>11. Betterman -- The BEST song Pearl Jam has ever done. Heartbreaking, thought-provoking, catchy . . . it's just the ultimate song. It displays Eddie Vedder's gift to get outside of himself and view things from other people's perspectives. It's just . . . I just love this song. 11/10<BR>12. Aye Davanita -- One of the ones I would probably cut out of the album. The instrumentals are cool, but by this point I'm thinking, &quot;THIS is the follow-up song to 'Betterman'? Where's the back button?&quot; 6/10<BR>13. Immortality -- Beautiful song. I might get called an idiot for this, but I subscribe to the theory that it's about Kurt Cobain. There are several clues in the song, plus I like to think that's what it's about. It's a great way to end an album. 10/10<BR>14. Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me -- Unfortunately, Pearl Jam did not realize that &quot;Immortality&quot; WAS a great way to end an album. There's no excuse for this garbage being included on this album. 0/10<br />In conclusion -- it's worth it for &quot;Not For You,&quot; &quot;Immortality,&quot; &quot;Corduroy, and &quot;Betterman.&quot; Those are the standouts, and most of the other songs are pretty good too. Pearl Jam is an awesome band, and I daresay the album might have garnered five stars from me (wow, that sounds self-important) if the last track had been removed completely. As far as recommeding it goes, if you're a new fan trying to figure out what to listen to, don't buy this first. Definitely get it at some point, but first listen to &quot;Ten&quot; and &quot;Vs.&quot;
B0002DKCMG|4.0|The creators of \\"Road Trip\\" and \\"Old School\\" present the comic misadventures of four American teenagers in Europe in the outrageous teen comedy \\"Eurotrip\\" After a humiliating break-up with his cheating girlfriend Fiona (Kristen Kreuk), Scotty Thomas (Scott Mechlowics) learns that his German e-mail penpal is actually an attractive girl and embarks on a fun-filled trip across Europe with his buddies (Jacob Pitts, Travis Wester & Michelle Trachtenburg) to win her heart. Along the way, these four teenagers are taking in the sights and enjoying what the Old World has to offer. \\"Eurotrip\\" is the hilarious gross-out teen comedy of 2004. This wildly entertaining comedy features an amusing young cast and uproarious humor. \\"Eurotrip\\" also includes funny cameo appearances by Jeffrey Tambor (Arrested Development), Lucy Lawless (Xena: Warrior Princess), Vinnie Jones (Snatch) and Matt Damon (The Bourne Supremacy). Though it failed in theaters, \\"Eurotrip\\" has become one of the funniest raunchy teen comedies in the past years.<br /><br />\\"Eurotrip\\" Unrated Edition hits the mark.

B000063DFN|5.0|Prelude:- I am not fond of many heavy metal acts but Iron Maiden along with Dream Theater are two of my most favourites. My first encounter with EDDIE THE HEAD is almost 5 years back when I bought the tape of \\"Best Of The beast\\". I thought every song is finest example of metal songs. I did not go for any more album that time. Almost 2 years back I bought a tape of \\"Seventh Son Of The Seventh Son\\", it became a favourite of mine & then I bought the CD of the same album. Then I got 'Number Of Beast'. Then I got the first 7 studio albums in Mp3 format. After listening them I decided \\"Powerslave\\" & \\"Piece Of Mind\\" are worth owning in CD format. So I got them.<br /><br />The Album:- Definitely the 2nd best album by Iron Maiden, 'Seventh Son...' is the still my top favourite.<br />majority of the songs will score 4.5 out of 5. The rating for the songs follows:-<br /><br />Aces High - 5.0<br />2 Minutes To Midnight - 4.5<br />Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) - 4.0<br />Flash Of The Blade - Very infectious. 5.0<br /><br />The Duellists - 4.5<br />Back In The Village - 4.0<br />Powerslave - 4.0<br />Rime Of The Ancient Mariner - Maiden's epic. Lots of drama. 5.0<br /><br />Conclusion:- All the songs has Maiden's trademark catchy melodies, great vocals and mindblowing riffs. Murray & Smith are too good. All 5 of them has some chemistry among them when they play. Moreover the remastered version has great sound, videos and it also has one of the best cover & artwork I have seen. I was expecting a another great artwork when I bought 'Piece Of Mind' but artwork of 'Piece Of Mind' does not even go near 'powerslave's. Any lover of melodic metal will need this metal-classic in their collection.
B0001Z363W|4.0|I just want to say that anyone who purchased this album thinking it was going to be A heavy metal riff fest has to be either the stupidest or most ignorant BLS fan alive.  Had you taken anytime to read anything Zakk had to say in the press then you would have been fully aware of what you might find on this disc.  Don't worry, Zakk has not gone soft, but showed us his softer side, which is just as brilliant and dark as his harder stuff.  The next BLS album will be a monster with guitars from he**, so sit back and listen to a great rock record and stop whining.
0156027321|5.0|Although the ending was very original, I think the best part of it was the floating carnivorous island.  One of the truly most terrifying moments in literature for a long, long time.  I don't know where Yann Martel gets his imagination from, but I hope they bottle the stuff!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I can't say enough about this record!! Any music fan that appreciates music as an art form would LOVE Muse. I did find them to be a bit Radiohead-esque but with more of a rock edge like we saw from Radiohead in &quot;Ok Computer&quot;. These guys are incredibly energetic and they are incredible musicians. Every lyric and chord change gets better every time I listen to it. I find this to be one of the best five records of 2004. Go out and buy it and you WILL NOT be disappointed.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee has created a fascinating literary character, Scout Finch, whose first person account of life in a sleepy, southern town as a young girl is rich with humor, drama and humanity itself.  The novel is a testimonial to Lee's love for her own father who serves as teacher, protector and reluctant hero; and, Lee's ability to immerse the reader in the depth of feeling between father and daughter is breathtaking.  Within this simple love story, Lee creates a stunning dichotomy that pits the purity and simplicity of childhood innocence against one of the darkest eras in southern American history when racial biases and violence ran deep and dark.  The novel's universal themes are truly studies in contrast:  humor versus tragedy; innocence versus guilt; good versus evil; ignorance versus truth.  Lee's character development is effortless and utterly believable, and leaves the reader pondering the futures of these beloved figures long after the last pages are read.  Lee weaves all of these elements together effortlessly, and never forgets that the heart of the novel is one of pure, simple love.

B0001NBMBC|2.0|There are three big problems with this album.  First, all the aggressiveness and heaviness has been produced out of the guitar sound.  Second, the drums are so quiet they might as well not be there.  Third, Slipknot has forgotten how to write interesting songs.<br />I loved Slipknot's first two albums.  I was impressed by the overall aggressiveness, percussiveness, and brutality of those albums.  I was also impressed by the range of vocal styles and the incorporation of a variety of percussion sounds and scratching into loud, heavy music.  Almost all the songs on those albums are catchy and make want to bang your head, if not beat the crap out of someone.<br />This album, however, has lost a lot of those elements.  The production quality, though professional sounding, has totally eliminated any aggressiveness and heaviness.  All the songs sound flat and boring.  Several of the songs are completely uninteresting (e.g. Welcome and The Nameless).  A few are downright weird (e.g. Prelude 3.0 and Circle).  A couple are close to classic Slipknot (e.g. Duality).  Practically every song has mainly clean vocals, not the standard growl/shout style.  Some songs like Circle and Danger - Keep Away have no distorted guitars at all!  What the hell???<br />I had hopes for this album, and it's sad to see a once-great band fade away like this.  If you liked their first two albums, you probably won't like this one very much.  I didn't.
1594200106|5.0|As a military spouse, I only keep the books that have made an impact on me and that I know I will read again. This is one of those books. I stayed up until 3AM so I could finish reading it and it was wonderful. This book is all about how books can affect your life, particularly the good ones. I find myself thinking about the characters and the story at different times during the day, wishing there were more. This book is written like a classic - nothing too overdone but but everything is woven together beautifully. I'm anxious for his next book!

B00020HEG6|5.0|John williams does it again for HP. Even though some of the older themes are not included, there are still some of them lingering around, and a few new ones includiing one with a theme that is dramatic and sad, but so beautiful, this theme is done in the Orchastra version and once in a while a flute. Also putting in new things that actually sound like the Star wars Cantina in the first Star wars A new hope, which you would think wasn't right for HP, but when you think about it, and fans of the books would know this that when that music is played it's the night bus scene which is supposed to be crazy and funny, so it fits perfectly. They still have the quiet HP Beginning theme but they dropped some other beautiful themes but the new ones are just as good. Overall it's a perfect cd. No mistakes all perfect. They also keep the same type of music for the battles as they did in the first two.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series just makes you think of how hard it was on the men of easy company or any other men fighting in world war two.  I was taken in from the first episode at training.  The details of the war were amazing, the authentic settings to the weapons.  If you are looking for a good world war series watch this series, you cant goo wrong with band of brothers, my grandfather fought in world war two in france and germany and i could never understand what he went thru until i saw band of brothers.  After this series we will never forget the men of easy company.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|i just bought this cd today. and i was shocked to hear that slipknot had changed their sound. and this is coming from a long time slipknot fan who has the rare slipknot cd with the track purity on it. if you listen to the self titled album you will notice that slipknot was heavy, fast, and kicked ass. but with this new album called VOL. 3. it does not sound the same as the first two albums. on this album they changed their sound from metal to mellow. since when did slipknot ever play with an acustic sound on their first two albums. or do guitar or drum solos. thats exactly what this album has. the only reason that the band made this cd limited edition was because they know that half the precantage of slipknot fans are gonna be pissed off that they changed their sound. but theyll still   buy it because it's limited edition. i mean, like how can you be pissed off at everyone and everything and say that people=s**t while listening to a band that has changed their sound from an angry pissed off metal band to a, i just sold out and i'm fake mellow band. talk about sell outs. the true slipknot fans will know exactly what i'm talking about not these new-comers.

B000055ZB8|5.0|It always surprises me when I suddenly notice there are horror films I should have seen years ago but am only seeing for the first time now. F.W. Murnau's 1922 classic take on the vampire legend, \\"Nosferatu\\" is one of these films. What horror film fan would not take some time to watch this legendary creation? Well, me for one. I put it off for years due to my general dislike of the vampire sub genre. You can only take so many debonair duffers tooling around a castle sinking their fangs into the throats of girls before you give up in frustration. A few vampire films I like, such as \\"Fright Night,\\" but as a general rule I can leave them more often than I can take them. It only took a few minutes of \\"Nosferatu\\" to discover this film wasn't going to be the type of vampire film I am used to seeing. You won't see a Frank Langella or Christopher Lee type playing the lead bloodsucker in this disturbing movie. One look at the hideous visage on the DVD cover provides ample evidence that the vampire in this movie won't wow the ladies with his good looks or suave charm. The vampire in \\"Nosferatu\\" is exactly how a vampire should look.<br />Set in Germany back in the nineteenth century, \\"Nosferatu\\" tells the horrific tale of an entire town stricken by the evil machinations of the rat-like Count Orlok, a truly sinister figure both loathsome and repellent. After a real estate agent named Knock sells the count his property, he falls under the spell of its gruesome tenant. The agent wants Orlok to come to Bremen, so he sends his assistant Hutter out to the castle. Harker's virginal wife Ellen objects to the sudden departure of her husband, but knows he must fulfill the obligations of his job. The scenes involving the trip to Orlok's pad and Hutter's subsequent stay are masterpieces of ominous foreshadowing. Animals bolt in panic as the coach nears the castle, the villagers fall silent when Hutter mentions Orlok, and his driver adamantly refuses to take the assistant to the castle. The count sends his own coach, an unusual device that moves supernaturally thanks to Murnau's use of fast motion photography. Obviously, strange things are afoot even before the vampire goes on his rampage.<br />Hutter falls prey to Orlok during his stay at the castle, but manages to escape and head back to Bremen to warn the town. His wife, in the meantime, suffers strange dreams and hallucinations that foreshadow her own encounter with the vampire. Knock goes off his rocker, and is institutionalized at the local jail. As for Orlok, he boards a vessel and heads to Bremen and a meeting with Hutter's virgin bride. The scenes on the ship are masterfully chilly. The count hides in a coffin in the hold of the ship, rising to feast on the unwary sailors. His movements on the boat, often accompanied by dozens of rats, nauseates even as it fascinates the viewer. By the time the movie reached this point, I couldn't think of a horror film character more hideous or repulsive than Orlok. When the ship reaches port, doctors fear a plague has killed the crew. They are partially right. A plague has reached town, but one these doctors have never seen before. Before long, townspeople start to drop like flies as Orlok pounds the cobblestones at night looking for Hutter's wife. The conclusion to the film involves no stakes, no holy water or crucifixes, but a good old fashioned German girl using her purity to destroy evil. I'll leave it you to see how she does it.<br />\\"Nosferatu\\" is a classic because a perceptive viewer can see so many themes in it. Is it a movie about sexuality, or Weimer politics, or a foreshadowing of the National Socialists? I'd like to promote a view of the movie I haven't seen yet (although it may be out there somewhere). I couldn't help but see a lot of potential anti-Semitic themes playing out in the movie. Orlok's physical presence resembles in no small way the depictions of Jews that often appeared in Germany even before the Third Reich rose to power. Associating the count with rats and plague is similar to how the Jews were portrayed in notorious anti-Semitic propaganda. I think, too, that the encrypted letter the count sent to Knock underscored what many Germans thought about Jews, that they communicated in esoteric languages and practiced a strange religion. Orlok, when he arrives in Germany, is an outsider, a dangerous foreigner seeking to kill and corrupt the good German people. Again, the Jews were always seen as outsiders with a hidden hostility to gentiles. The conclusion of the film only confirmed this thesis in my eyes, when a pure German woman using her wiles managed to defeat the evil count. Germans always worried about Jews marrying their women, so the idea that a girl could not only withstand the advances of the count but also use his lust to destroy him must have resonated deeply with certain segments of the audience. I could go on and on, matching certain scenes with how many Germans perceived the Jews.<br />I hope the film isn't anti-Semitic. But as a horror film, it is unmatched. Murnau's technical experimentation along with Max Schreck's portrayal of Orlok make this film a must see for horror fans. The DVD is good too, with a ton of extras. You get extensive liner notes on location sights, notes on Murnau's influences, still galleries, several different soundtracks, and a commentary track from a film historian. The quality of the picture transfer didn't look too good, but the movie is over eighty years old. If you haven't seen \\"Nosferatu\\" yet, you're missing out on a great experience.ting the count with rats and plague is similar to how the Jews were portrayed in notorious anti-Semitic propaganda.

B000003TA4|4.0|This CD is really great, I'll start off with saying that.  I do have two complaints though(niether of them the band's fault).  The CD is overproduced and too slick,like Kurt himself said.  Also, the song 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' makes most of their other songs underrated because of its popularity, but I guess that's not anything against the album.  Overall, very good.  The songwriting is amazing and although some, or most, depening on what you think, of the guitar and bass parts in the songs are simple, they still sound great and make each song what it is(along with the drums of course).  There is no song on here that I don't like, although I tend to not listen to Something In the Way that much, but there's nothing wrong with it.  Worth getting, especially if you are a fan.

0316168815|4.0|I was first drawn to this debut novel because my first novel was published at the same time, covering very similar subject-matter and themes. Kudoes to Alice Sebold for an interesting first effort. I found the story premise very original, and the story does linger in the mind for quite some time after you've read it. This is the story of a teenage girl named Susie who is raped and killed one day on her way to school. She goes to Heaven and is able to observe all the events around her dead body--her family's grief, her killer's footsteps, her friends' gossip about her murder, etc etc.  I kept guessing if they would catch the killer. The ending surprised me. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;

B0001LJCMK|5.0|Josh Homme (Queens of the Stone Age) rocks out on drums in his new band, Eagles of Death Metal.  If you like grungy desert rock, you'll love this cd.  Their cover of \\"Stuck in the Middle With You\\" is sweet, and the best track is titled \\"Whorehoppin\\".  This album just makes me want to smash something, and then lay back and have a beer and a cigarette.  Reminiscent of The Black Keyes for their gritty, old sound.  In the words of lead singer Jesse \\"The Devil\\" Hughes, they want to bring their listeners \\"death by sexy\\", and that's just what they did.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This isn't so much a review as it is a message to all the 'kids' who have been calling Slipknot sell-outs.<br />1.) I don't think you can call a band that has two multi-platinum albums before this SELL OUTS. Because selling out means doing it for the money, and trust me, these guys already have plenty of that.<br />2.) Slipknot doesn't write music for you, or anybody, they write music as a band and as a band they should be allowed to change their sound as much as they want.<br />3.) If you can't enjoy this because it isn't 'hard enough' than not only are you closed minded, but you also don't know the first thing about musical appreciation.<br />4.) 'Duality' is the best Slipknot song thus far.<br />5.) For everybody complaining that this album isn't 'heavy enough' and 'too melodic' than maybe I should remind you of a song from 1999 called 'Wait and Bleed' -- that song wasn't all that heavy and it was also extremely melodic.<br />With that said, I hope many of the people who've decided to bash this band for venturing into new directions realize how dumb they look. Eat your words.
B000268QB2|5.0|This British trio debuts with this sublime album of melancholy pop reminiscent of Coldplay, Travis and U2, but unlike those bands, Keane perform without guitars. Their stately, piano-based songs are masterfully constructed with memorable hooks and soaring choruses, the musicianship is first-rate, and Tom Chaplin's swoon-worthy vocals are a wonder to behold, particularly when he breaks into a gorgeous falsetto. 5/17/2004 -KEXP.org - Don Yates
0156012197|4.0|This book annoyed me in the begining because I hate reading books. But when I started reading the book i realized that the book was kind of fun. It showed the little prince teaching to adults that sometimes you should listen to little kids too. They also have their own problems. Teenages are mostly ignored in the big world. If you are a parent or an adult try and do this. You find something amazing in your teenager or kid. They have many great ideas that have never been thoughy off, so listen to them. I though to me self that I am growing up to be an adult soon so I used this idea. I went to talk to a kid in my neiborhood. I started talking to him and I found something. He said ,\\"don't be like my parent ok\\". Then I realized what he was trying to tell me. He was trying to tell me to be serious all the time it will just make you life bad. So that made me understand kids more. Kid want to have good time all the time but the good times can't stay all the time. So if you are a parent try to make your kids have a good time if you can.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|It is funny how people who know nothing about music feel that they can go ahead and bash a really great album. Those of you who gave this cd five stars have true taste. For the rest of you, if you are going to write a review, write with some substance. This CD belongs in every TRUE music fan's collection. <br />I really enjoy this CD not only because the songs are well constructed, I enjoy it because I can relate to most of the lyrics. The piano in my opinion adds another dimension to Avril, and her voice still soars, sending chills up my spine. This CD inspires me to live, laugh, and enjoy life. <br />My favorite tracks are:<BR>Together<BR>How Does it Feel<BR>Forgotten
B00020HEG6|4.0|This music is absolutly amazing. I am not a Potter fan but I am a John Williams fan. But this soundtrack I would have to say does not sound like the same Williams I've know since the 80's. When Chamber of Secrets came out so many Potter fanatics were upset saying that the music is not scary enough. Why does John Williams use so many bells? Well those fans will be happy with this soundtrack then. The music is very mysterious. However I like the more action beat and happier songs such as Aunt Marge's Waltz and the Knight Bus.  So far my favorite song however is The Whomping Willow. I think John Williams was able to create a much darker film than the second just by the music alone. Of course the difference in the music is also due to Alfonso Curon the new director because the director always has a little bit influence on what the music becomes. This is definatley a series just like Star Wars that will be a collection of great music that will be a must own.
B000148KK2|4.0|Let's not be so angry with Diana Krall. She hasn't thrown canvas sacks full of kittens into the river. She hasn't stolen the children's candy. She hasn't made a left-hand turn from the right lane... without signalling! What she has done is branch off from her usual fare into (what I think is) some very interesting territory.<br />Yes, she has obviously taken some ideas from her new hubby and found a somewhat Costello-ian voice in some of her songs. But, Diana is still in there, too. This is still jazz. It's not the jazz we have come to expect from Diana Krall. It is, however, very good. It is still the melting chocolate voice that first drew me to her music. It is still the strong (and as some have already pointed out, more prevalant) piano work we have all loved.<br />So, just sit down, take a few deep breaths, find your &quot;happy place&quot; and listen to the cd a few more times. You'll find Ms. Krall in there. She's stretching a few new muscles, but she's still playing the same game.<br />Besides, whenever I can find an album that incorporates Tom Waits and Diana Krall (track 3 - &quot;Temptation&quot;) you better believe that I'm happy.

B000002J0B|5.0|this is a very diverse album that shows different aspects of Led Zeppelin. there's prog zeppelin (The Song Remains the Same, No Quarter). No Quarter is certainly more dark side-era floydian with it' somewhat psychadelic feel and excellent use of keyboards (curtesy of Jones). awesome fuzz guitar by page, some eerie distorted vocals by Plant, and excellent drumming by Bonham. Bonham was cool cause he knew there was a time and a place to go crazy. this song's closest lyrical cousin is The Immagrant Song. it's a song with cold and dark and dreary imagry on an otherwise spring/summer feeling album. there's acoutic-electric folky zeppelin (Over the Hills and Far Away), there's pop zeppelin (Dancing Days, D'yer Mak'er). the latter is an unusual mix of 50s pop and reggae, but done in LZ style. there's the obligitory hard rock song, The Ocean, which is truly awesome and an excellent closer. this album is bookended by two rocking songs which are about singing. The Ocean also has probably one of the greatest guitar riffs. this album contain's one of led zeppelin's finest ballads, or possibly their finest, The Rain Song. truly beautiful with the lyrics, acoustic guitar, vocals, and pseudo strings. this beautiful song wouldn't have been made if harrison hadn't made the challenge. they accepted it and stuck it up his ass. The Crunge shows a funky, humorous side of zeppelin. apparently this must of been inspired by james brown's Sex Machine. this is especially evident with the part about the bridge. although the title track was held off of this album, only to appear on physical grafiti, i am not bothered. for even though that track would've felt right at home on this LP, it felt even more at home on PG and was counted among the legendary tracks on that paricular album. plus, it would've been odd for zeppelin to release an album with a title track. they had already run into enough controversy with album titles. three albums that really didn't continue eachother, then a mysterious untitled one. this album had a title though and featured. the album cover was designed by hipgnosis (of pink floyd fame). it helped give the album a mysterious feel. the first and last to be commisioned by him. when you think about it Led Zeppelin was a progressive rock band, but always stayed in touch with their roots, and no matter what, they always managed to produce something awesome.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|The album is a bit of a disappointment, lacking a lot of the fun pop spirit that made Let Go so surprisingly enjoyable.  Great songs like Sk8er Boi and Complicated are not duplicated here.<br />On the plus side, the album is much more consistent than Let Go, losing the novelty tracks like the spoken word/'Cheerios in my spoon' songs that haunt the back half of Let Go.  <br />The first single, &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; is nice.  It's not a oh-my-goodness-I-need-to-buy-the-single kind of song, but it is a good illustration of what the rest of the album is like.  &quot;He Wasn't&quot; has some entertaining moments, but has a pieced together feel.  The rest of the songs seem to blend into a sleepy sameness, with overall a more adult-contemporary sound.<br />Take the median track from Let Go, multiple by 12, and you have Under My Skin.
B000002J09|4.0|this album captures all the styles previously done on their first three albums, except these songs can be louder, lenghtier, more complex, and more mysterious. all songs on this album are masterpieces unto themselves. if you haven't heard, or even heard of stairway to heaven by now, surely you're living in one of the most desolate places on earth. if you are new to the band, this is a good place to start, and if you like what you hear, you may want to pick up their other albums. if you like Rock and Roll and Black Dog, you might want to consider getting their first two albums. if you like Going to Califorinia and The Battle of Evermore, Led Zeppelin III is the one for you. III's also good if you like the mysterious. thankfully, that album doesn't overdo it with Lord of the Rings refference, like this particular one does. if you like the differnt stuff like Four Sticks, or songs with Pop Elements, Houses of The Holy is definatly worth a looking in to. if you like the epic rocker Stairway to Heaven and and When the Levee Breaks, Physical Graffiti (just the first disc alone!) has more epic rockers than you could imagine. mind you LZ III, this album, and Houses of the Holy, though they share common elements are completely dfferent. III which was this album's predecessor has a notable majority of acoustic folky songs, and their fifth album Houses of the Holy is extremely diverse. the one that really brings them back to the heavy blues rock with full force,  while offering us a diverse batch of leftovers from previous albums,would have to be Physical Graffiti. don't just be under the impression that Led Zeppelin's only awesome album was their forth one. for me, this particualar album wears thin at times do to the overplayed, overrated status of the album and the individual songs contained within it. also, the overabundance of Lord of the Rings references can be annoying. that's the only reason i didn't give this album 5 stars.
B000002UAX|2.0|The cover really says it all.  It's blank and empty, just like the thought that went into writing and producing half of the songs.  If you like unfinished demos, 60 second jams and unexplained noise, this is for you.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Wow...a little over a year ago I lost the feel for Slipknot..completely. They used to be my favorite band, period. After I over listened to self titled and iowa I just despised them (lol despised :P) but today about an hour ago, I bought this album, put it into my player..and was completely amazed, there old raunchy riffs that were more on the immature side of slipknot they used to play have been depleted from there old signature sound. Vol 3. is a much more mature evolved version of Slipknot. Plus the album has two acoustic songs, wow both show much talent was put into . This album is past imagination, it has regained my respect for Slipknot, go to your local album store and buy this...right now.
B000002UAR|2.0|No, it's not one of the most influential albums ever.  No, it's not one of the Beatles' best.  No, every song is not fabulous; in fact, a minority of the songs are truly insightful and this doesn't include Tomorrow Never Knows.   Actually, George provides the best song. Overall, nearer the bottom the Beatles barrel.  Focus on the earlier non-drug induced albums.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|This CD was something different for me.  The first time I listened to the whole thing I was like &quot;What is this?&quot; This is was nothing ilke the first CD that I loved so much.  But as I went on I found that there was artistic growth and the songs did eventually grow on me.  So I'm saying don't blow this CD off the first time you listen to it.  You have to get used to Avril's new persona.  It's still worth buying.  There are still some great songs on here.  This is my opinion of all of them!<br />1.  Take Me Away (4/5)- A nice song about pressure and being feeling alone.  Pretty good.<BR>2.  Together (5/5)- A good way to describe a relationship that may be going sour.  It doesn't even have to be a bf/gf relationship either.<BR>3.  Don't Tell Me (10/5)- THE WHOLE REASON I BOUGHT THE CD! SELF-EXPLANATORY!!!<BR>4.  He Wasn't (4/5)- It's uptempo but I'm not too big on this one.  I'm a guy so what can I say!!!  It's still good.<BR>5.  How Does It Feel? (5/5)- Love this song!!! I can relate to this song so much it's scary.  But who can't?  Great!!!<BR>6.  My Happy Ending (5/5)- This is lined up to be her next single and it will a great one too.  It's a cool song!<BR>7.  Nobody's Home (4/5)- A pretty good song that shows depth!!!<BR>8.  Forgotten (3.5/5)- A lot of the words are repeated but you have to give her credit for taking a darker look at things.  I'm guessing Ben Moody (formely of Evanescence) helped her on this one.<BR>9.  Who Knows (4/5)- Encouraging song!!! Live like it's your last day!!!<BR>10. Falls to Pieces (4/5)- Good song for those who are with someone and for those who are head over heels in love with someone.  A song for all those stalkers out there! (j/k) :-)<BR>11. Freak Out (4/5)- Good song that says F it whenever you're having one of those days with people trying to control your life.<BR>12. Slipped Away (10/5)- Has to be one of my favorite songs and the best way to end an album!!!! The tone is so beautiful.  Brings tears to those softies out there :-)!!!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|i am from canada and i just picked up the new Avril lavigne cd today, i think it is a really good rock album, if u wanna rock out.  i love the whole album from start to finish  i would recomend that everyone has this album in  their cd collection,  so much better than all the britany spears albums put together
B0000024JN|4.0|I'll tell you, I'm not generally into rap or hiphop (exceptions being some underground stuff such as the streets or dizzee rascal), but the Beastie Boys are one exception for me. Of all their albums, this one is the best. The smartest lyrics (which are in fact hilarious), the best instrumental work, and the most entertaining. This is one you can party to.<BR>Buy it, it's only 8.99.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Alright, this is Slipknot's most disappointing album to date. I'm not saying it's bad but it is their most commerical and blah album. Self titled (the 1st major label album) was their best by far in my opinion. Iowa was good but not great, this sounds like they just did it to do it. &quot;Circle&quot; (trk. 6) is an acoustic ballad thing, which stops the little momentum the album has and the lyrics of 90% of the album are just not of the &quot;can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes&quot; calibur, just not insane enough. The only highlights of this album are Prelude 3.0, the Blister Exists, and Virus of Life. Many skip over tracks on this album.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This is not only one of The Flaming Lips' best albums, I believe it is one of the music's best. For Noise Pop lovers, this album is heaven. The sound of this CD is so layered and interesting, I hear something new everytime. Wayne Coyne's singing is as good and boyish as ever, and the instrumentals are full. Check out Do You Realize?? of course and also my personal favorite, Are You A Hypnotist?? (wow they really like the double ?s)<BR>Buy it.
B00013F38K|3.0|I truly love these DVD box sets of entire seasons of shows.  I buy the good ones to encourage their creation.  As DVD box sets go, this isn't a good one.  The advance information about the shows being cropped for 16:9 and edited for time was reason enough for me to rent instead of buy this collection.  These flaws to me are fatal.<br />You buy the DVD to get the best version available.  If I want to watch something shot in 4:3 at 16:9 I can adjust my set.  The three star rating is based solely on the quality of the program.  The technical quality of the DVD is the source of any flaws I find in this box set and I have to subtract at least two stars for that alone.  No reservations about recommending the show itself.<br />The show itself is better than I remembered.  I can appreciate it more now as an adult than as I kid.  Very nicely done and the first season of episodes are some of the best.  Episode 10 with Jodie Foster is among the best of the bunch in this collection.<br />I sincerely hope that future editions of this DVD, perhaps a complete box set of all seasons of Kung Fu will correct the technical flaws.  They simply must transfer from the original elements of the show at the original aspect ratio and not edit the episodes for time.  It was a sloppy mistake.  This show deserved better care and attention.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I wasn't the biggest fan of her debut album, only a few songs that I liked, but this album is much different, and I like every single song on it. If you were a fan of Avril from her debut, definitely pick up this album, you'll be more than happy! If you're not a fan of Avril, give this album a chance, it's different, and more mature. Also anyone who is just looking for a great female rock album, don't look no further!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Yep.  That Sk8er girl has matured a little bit...LET GO was flashy and radio friendly (but good), but this album's a little on the dark side (but still good).<br />From the confessional &quot;How Does it Feel&quot; to the moving &quot;Slipped Away&quot; to the in-your-face &quot;Freak Out&quot;, this album covers a wide spectrum of musical tastes and subjects.  Still popish, but with an edge, UNDER MY SKIN will grab your ears and take them for a ride.<br />It's almost universally understood that Avril Lavigne is a talent; you may not like her style, but you got to hand it to her--she writes lyrics like that should be written.  The songs on this album are often emotionally charged (&quot;Take Me Away&quot;, &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot;) and sometimes daring (&quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; basically advocates virginity).  However, they're all of top-quality, delivered by a young woman who's beginning to appeal to adults as well as precocious fourteen-year-old girls.<br />The anti-Brittany, Avril Lavigne is a standout.  Everybody's copying her, and she may have copied a few people, but she is unique.  UNDER MY SKIN is a definite must-have for music fans...even those of you who are &quot;anti-Avril&quot;.  In the words of the great Kris Kristofferson: You're the only one that you are screwing, when you put down what you don't understand.  Take it to heart, and just buy the damn record.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I don't know why everyone says this is such a bad album. I love it! I have both the American version and the UK version, which contains an extra bonus track, &quot;I Always Get What I Want&quot;.<br />Avril's sound has definitely matured quite a lot since her last album. I'm glad she ditched hitmakers &quot;The Matrix&quot; and instead co-wrote songs on &quot;Under My Skin&quot; with her guitarist Evan Taubenfeld (tracks 1,3,11) and Indie Queen Chantal Kreviazuk (tracks 2,4,5,8,12) for example.<br />I heard &quot;Take Me Away&quot; months ago with the release of the &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; single and loved it right away. It was definitely a great foreshadowing to the rest of the album, which carries a somewhat darker sound.<br />In my opinion, the best tracks on this CD are &quot;Slipped Away&quot; (a poignant ballad mourning the death of her Grandfather) and the next single from the album, &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; (which was performed on 'Saturday Night Live', May 5th, 2004).<br />This album is a must have for any punk-rock lover's collection.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|More poser trash... when will this brat shut up? There's nothing here that wasn't done on her first album. I can't believe she had the nerve to say this was &quot;deep and emotional&quot;. &quot;Don't try to tell me what to do&quot;? She has NOT matured in the least. Do NOT support this little no talent!!!
B000021YQV|1.0|If I could I would give this zero stars. But I can't so I will only give it one. This band is call metal. What's so metal about them? Have people you lsiten to them heard a really metal band? A really metal band puts far more into there music then this. I can't stand Nu-Metal.
B000002H5I|5.0|Winner of 3 Grammys in 1988 for Best New Artist (one of the few winners that were the best of their years), Pop Female performance (Fast Car), and Folk Album. It was also nominated for Album of the Year, and Best Song &amp; Record. I was shocked to find out that she lost Best Song to Bobby McFerrin for &quot;Don't Worry, Be Happy&quot;. While I remember McFerrin's song, it has not aged well. But &quot;Fast Car&quot; still sounds relevant, with its telling lyrics about people who reach for a better life. A theme in her album is a cry to the lowly to try to rise above their conditions. While she doesn't give an answer how, she gives words of encouragement to let others know that there is hope.<br />On this album a lot of musical genre influences can be heard. You can hear things from Pop (Fast Car) to Reggae (She's Got Her Ticket). This was labeled as Folk music but it has such a blend of styles that you really can't categorize it. It's a great album and is mentioned many times when people talk of great debuts and great albums of the 80's.
B00005JLXE|4.0|When compared to Spider-Man.<br />What they need to do is make a motion Picture with Daredevil, Spider-man, the Hulk, and the X-men! That would be the bomb!<br />They could battle Superman, Batman. Hellboy, and the JLA.<br />Now we are talkin' a frakin' movie!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Oh yeah, you should see this flick, it's not that bad.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Sofia Coppola's directorial venture which made her win an Oscar(2004) for Original Screenplay is a beautiful movie where Bob Harris (Bill Murray) an american actor going thru mid-life crisis, away from his family comes to Tokyo for a television commercial shoot ; accidentally meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson)  a fresh Yale graduate in Psychology who has a very busy photographer husband. Both of them going thru the same spell of loneliness &amp; helplessness find comfort in each other's company that develops in an unlikely bond.<br />Two Americans stint with tokyo lifestyle is very amusing to watch.For those who are not familiar with Tokyo lifestyle like me , here is a good chance to go through Tokyo parties, karaoke bars, nightlife, etc..<br />The movie is a collection of very fine moments between the two, but the finest moment comes at the end when Murray is leaving Tokyo,both realize that there is no way they could ever maintain a relationship with each other, his final statement to her is whispered into her ear and we cannot know what it was he said.<br />Everything in the movie is handled so elegantly and tenderly!<br />If this one is 'to be found' in your collection, it would be as apt as its tag line 'Everyone wants to be found'.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I grew up reading the Uncanny X-Men and other comics, and I have to say this is a pretty darn good picture. Humans came a long way from the old 1980's superhero movies. You gotta love it! Finally, after all these years, they have made some huge strides in producing quality superhero movies. If you read X-Men when you were younger, or are young and reading the comic, then you will love this flick. Simply awesome!<br />I didn't give anything away, did I? Heck no! Go see it ASAP.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I have been waiting almost a year for there new cd. I read a review in a magazine in MAY of 2003 that they were going to be recording new music and that they hoped to get the new cd out in September of 2003. Never happened as I waited till October. I heard they would release it in December of 2003. Never happened. Now in May of 2004 on May 25 there new cd &quot;Volume 3 The Subliminal Verses&quot; was released. I have heard &quot;Durality&quot; and that song is awesome. If you liked Joey's drumming in the last two cd's wait till you here this cd. This is such a good cd that anyone will enjoy if your a fan of metal/rock.
B0001XAOMA|5.0|Ooops, wrong movie!<br />Okay, I'm reviewer number 1,033. Screw it! Just see the darn movie, it's good! Darn Good! They did a great job makin this flick.<br />Oh yeah, this picture is a MUST OWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Renting from BlockBuster is an option too...
B000002H33|5.0|I am a relatively new bass player (i've been playing for one and a half years), and if I never listened to this album, I would not be where I am today. Cliff Burton tought me how to play metal. I am a 17 year old 130 lb weakling, but Cliff inspires me to build up my stamina and thrash like the mad man he was. For me not being a Metallica fan, it should mean something when I say this is my favorite Metal album. Battery is a perfect opener...similar to Fight Fire with Fire from Ride, but more varied and more interesting.  Master is the classic track of course...awesome songwriting and structure.  The Thing that Should Not Be is probably the least talked about Metallica song, which is pretty sad. I am not much of a huge fan of Kirk Hammet (his solos are too repetitive), but the solo in this song is simply amazing.  Sanitarium shows off their songwriting skills like Master. Disposable Heroes: my favorite song on the album. Blisteringly fast, awesome riffs, lyrics, everything. The best part of the song is the triple-harmony ending. So beautiful. Lepper Messiahalso has amazing lyrics, and becomes a very fun song near the end when it picks up speed. Orion is beautiful. Many guitar solos, a little bass solo, and an awesome bassy classical riff.  Damage, Inc. is the best closing song ever. It brings light to an otherwise dark album, and ends it with confidence. If you are a bass player, I highly recommend Master. The presence of the bass on the album is so incredible. Also, this album is very progressive without being cheesy. Sure, ...And Justice for All has its title track of 9:44, and only two songs under the 6 minute mark, but the songs are much more repetetive...plus, there is virtually no bass on that album. Master of Puppets is their masterpiece, and is what keeps me listening to an otherwise unrespectable group of guys

B000069I1C|1.0|That's it. That's my whole review.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I am really impressed by how much Avril has matured.  Her maturity is really on display on this album.  The lyric are deep and by shows a different side of her personality.  Great job Avril.
0689835604|5.0|My eight-month-old loves this book b/c he's in the peek-a-boo stage.  He's not old enough to handle the book himself b/c he would tear off the flaps, but he smiles whenever I read it.  Kind of short, so good for younger babies with shorter attention spans.
B0000C1HLF|2.0|You're walking down the sidewalk, minding your own business, when you hear the squeal of tires and the dreadful sound of metal hitting metal at high velocity.  Yes, it's a car accident.  You look over, and see two cars joined at the fender, smoke billowing out of both engines.  Sirens start wailing and lights start flashing.  You really have somewhere to be, something better to do, but you can't pull yourself away.  Somebody could be dead in there!  We're all attracted to blood, even when we are sickened by it.<br />I felt that way two weeks ago, when I turned on Movie Central and saw that Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle was on.  I meant to just leave it on and read my book while my wife did whatever she was doing on the computer.  But I found myself constantly looking up, and finally just put the book down.  Much like the above mentioned wreck, I was sickened yet fascinated.  Also like the above accident, it was sort of neat to see the explosions but I wasn't happy with myself afterward for staying and observing it.<br />I will give the movie credit for one thing.  It takes you by the throat at the beginning and says &quot;don't expect any semblance of realism in the following 105 minutes.  You won't be getting any.  Take my advice, or you'll be even more disappointed.&quot;  After finally letting me down (my throat still hurts), I was equipped to watch it without engaging any brain cells whatsoever.  It was amazing.  I tried to take a poll afterwards, but all of the cells were out for the night (there was a sign on the door that said &quot;since you won't be using us tonight, we'll be down at the pub&quot;).  The movie does this by having a completely impossible sequence where a helicopter starts up and takes off as it's falling off of a dam (face-down).  It does a neat 90 degree turn, just as it's about to hit the water, and flies away.  And that's the most believable thing in the movie!<br />The plot, what there is of it, is about a rogue Angel trying to sell an encrypted list of FBI witness protection people to the highest bidder.  It's no spoiler that Moore is the bad gal in this one, as the marketing of the movie trumpeted the fact.  Our three Angels begin the movie by rescuing Ray Carter from North Korea, and then being tasked with finding out who killed the other person who has a key to the encryption.  There are a couple of &quot;twists&quot; that are seen miles away, and Moore gets to be super-threatening (showing how evil she is by double-crossing somebody and blowing them away).<br />While it's a thin plot, it's also incoherent, held together by the barest of bikini straps as we are led from one soft-core male fantasy to another.  In one sequence, in order to get a valuable key and security card from a dock worker, the Angels do a long involved strip-tease.  I didn't time it, but I would guess the sequence took almost five minutes.  As a full-blooded male, I can't say I was that disappointed, but it's a good thing my brain cells were off getting drunk, because they would have rebelled otherwise.  It's obvious that the three ladies were just having fun with this flick, and perhaps this scene just let them be the exhibitionist they always wanted to be.<br />Barrymore's character also gets a little bit of angst, as we find out that she was on the list for something that happened years ago.  She quits the team and heads of to Mexico, where she has a vision of one of the earlier Angels (Jacqueline Smith, who doesn't look too bad, but you have to wonder what she would look like without the soft-focus lens) that prompts her to come back into the fold.  I thought it was a nice homage back to the original series, and something that the first movie could have used, but oh well.  The other characters don't get much to do other than fight and look beautiful.  They're all given love-interests, but there's no chemistry between them.  Liu's character is given an English father, which could have been interesting if anything had been done with it.  However, that wouldn't do in a popcorn movie like this one, so instead we get a Three's Company rip-off that's painful to watch.  Thankfully, both scenes are pretty short.<br />Moore is interesting, however.  She treats it like the fluff role it is, but she gives it just enough bite to wish that she had killed off the other three and taken over the agency herself.  She lights up the screen whenever she's on, and it's probably her best role in a while.  The other actor who acquits himself well is Bernie Mac.  He brings a lot of fun to the picture, and I loved his &quot;Black Irish&quot; exchange with one of the dock workers.  I found his presence completely implausible, especially with the reference to the previous Bosley (Bill Murray), but I loved the way Mac portrayed his character.  There is an homage to Murray's not being around, but it would been nice to include the other previous Bosley from the series in the homage.  Oh well, I guess you can't have everything.<br />Everybody else either chews the scenery with relish or just has a blast without exercising any of their acting chops.  The action is frenetic and well-choreographed, and there's something to be said for watching beautiful women kick a bunch of guys' butts, so the movie has that as well.  However, the above compliments encompass the only good things in this movie.  If you happen to stumble across it during your movie travels, and you can't find anything else to watch, then you may be rewarded.  But c'mon.  There's got to be some yard work to do or something.<br />David Roybeen done with it.

B000099T2L|4.0|I'm sure that by now you've all heard Beyoncé's debut solo album Dangerously In Love.  She's had 3 straight hit singles, won 5 Grammy awards and the album is triple platinum and still sitting in the top 20 on the pop charts.<br />The album starts off in the wrong way.  As soon as you hit play you hear the bouncy lead single \\"Crazy in Love\\".  This song is ok, nothing incredible and Jay-Z's verse is only decent, you can tell he didn't put his best effort into it.  However, it was incredibly catchy song for the summer and had the girls dancing.  I began to dislike it after I heard it about 10,000 times.  You've heard the Scott Storch produced \\"Baby Boy\\".  Scott Storch is a genius when it comes to production.  He's been Dr. Dre's primary ghost-producer for the past 5+ years in case you didn't know.  Despite being overplayed, I still like to listen to this song for some reason.  Probably because of the superior production.  Storch also produced \\"Me Myself and I\\" which is one of the best on the album.  This is the only single where Beyoncé made an effort to show off some of her vocal talent.  Production and lyrics are on point here.  \\"Signs\\" with Missy Elliot is a surprisingly good song.  I usually can't stand the songs Missy produces for R&amp;B artists but this one is good.  Beyoncé shines here and the song flows beautifully and is also conceptual.  She talks about being in love with a Sagittarius (Jay-Z).  \\"Speechless\\" is another superior track where you get to see Beyoncé actually using her voice to do some good.  The ballads are clearly the best songs on this album.<br />This album isn't without its flaws however.  \\"Hip-hop Star\\", \\"That's How You Like It\\", and \\"Naughty Girl come off as just being filler tracks.  Beyoncé's production on \\"Yes\\" is mediocre and the song has a boring concept. While \\"The Closer I Get to You\\", \\"Dangerously in Love 2\\" and \\"Be With You\\" are great songs, they're just simply remakes.  The one with Luther Vandross isn't as obvious though.<br />This album has its ups and downs.  Beyoncé has a great southern voice but many tracks here are made for parties and clubs.  She also needs to lay off the remakes of old songs.  If she actually tried I'm sure she could make a classic album of mostly ballads.  Modern R&amp;B desperately needs an album like that right now.  I guess she needed the club songs for record sales since this is her first solo effort.  Now that she has an established fan base maybe she'll limit her next album to 1 or 2 club songs at the most and it will be absent of remakes.<br />Rating 3.5/5 (closer to 3.75) Rounded up to 4
0375432302|4.0|Whether Dan Brown intends to educate or entertain lies in the minds of each reader.  I picked up this book to be entertained.  I went in knowing it was a work of fiction.  A good author can blend fact and fiction to present a plausible story.  This story was compelling enough to keep my interest without wanting to put the book down.  Others have commented on the one-dimensional nature of the characters and that is pretty accurate, however, it does not detract from the story.  Religious zealots will hate this book because it presents a thoughtful alternative to the mindless following that is all faith.  There is nothing wrong with faith.  Just don't disagree with those who will not believe anything other than their own.  These are some of the people that hated this book.  Others who hated it are critics who aim to discredit the character development.  I'm simply a guy who doesn't get a chance to read much because I lack the free time others might have.  This book consumed most of my free time and kept my attention until I was finished.  If you want a good story that entertains and sometimes amuses but clearly lacks some factual basis (and you recognize that as being OK), then read this book.  It's not for the dimwitted or close-minded.
0316666343|4.0|This book was more than a little unnerving; the narrator occupies her own role as a semi-omniscient teenage girl watching from heaven as her family copes with her disappearance, while also occupying the role of each of her family members and her killer. While the book carries a powerful message of the healing qualities of family, it also juxtaposes the more sinister aspects of dysfunctional families and coldly comments on society's movement toward fractured communities and the decline of the neighborhood lifestyle. Can get heavy-handed with the imagery, but has good characters and an interesting storyline.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This was a magnificent movie. I am astonished and shocked that it was not well-received in by film critics, as I thought it was beautiful, extremely well-acted, and incredible. As a survivor of child sexual abuse, I was very triggered (which means being forced by outside stimuli to re-experience the abuse) by the harsh flash effect employed in this movie. But unlike other triggering books and movies, it was worth it to sit through this film. It was amazing and I would recommend it to all!

B00005B36H|5.0|When you feel the anger of everything that is wrong with your world, your confining bubble, your smelly little experience; you need this album.  If you are tired of fear, suppression, anxiety, lack of momentum, and the restraint of concentrated insight required to function in our ADHD society then you need this album.  It is your release.  It is as close as you can come to legal satisfaction.  Let it out.  Go on.  You are human after all.  You have your limits.<BR>Be balanced. Keep the faith that not all produced by our human society has lost its course in the dark night of profits, productivity, and correctness.  Passion, precision, insight, depth, satisfaction, dependence, need are all emotions experienced during my time with this album.  It got me through when I had a need to feel the rythm, the connection, the power, the beauty.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|i heard this album at a friends place who got it from usa and was disappointed as i had expected this to be a rock album but this is a pop cd and is a sellout.i would rather wait for the new cd of audioslave to be released.not recommended to rock fans.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|this has to be my favorite band and i must say that this is their best work... MFKR was good, their selftitled albums was better, Iowa was amazing... but Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) rules everything. There is not one song on this cd i dont love. Sure tracks 6, 11, and 14 are acoustic based, but they are still very much Slipknot songs. Some say they sound like Stonesour but you dont know what your talking about... its nothing like them. If you are new to the metal scene this is great place to start, if your a long time fan of this group then you will love this cd to death... buy it....it is so worth it....Slipknot rules, and they've done it again...
B0000C8AV3|5.0|THIS WAS AN UNDERRATED CD FROM ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK SINGERS EVER AND THIS IS MY FAVOURITE DYLAN ALBUM ALONG WITH SLOW TRAIN COMING VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.FIVE STARS FOR THIS MASTERPIECE.
B0001611DI|5.0|Dawn of the Dead is without a doubt one of the best horror films ever made.  Much more intense and bloody than its predecessor film (Night of the Living Dead), DOTD drags the viewer into a nightmare world inhabited by living corpses who feed on the living and the dwindling number of humans who fight them.  The plot follows four people (two TV station employees and two SWAT team members) who take a helicopter and make a run out of a zombie-infested city to try to find somewhere safe.  They do find what is utopia:  A shopping mall loaded with everything needed for survival.  However, it too is overrun by the living dead who show no signs of leaving voluntarily.  <br />Although some of the effects are dated, this film is NOT for the squeamish.  For the horror film buff or zombie fanatic, this film is a must-see.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I really have to say I'm impressed with this album. I really enjoyed IOWA, and was hoping the new album would be similar to it. I heard the single \\"Duality\\" which was decent, but I could tell that Slipknot was heading in a weird direction. I was expecting to be disapointed with the album, but I was pleasantly suprised. Slipknot maintains the heaviness, but has added melody to the mix. I can tell they've really stepped up the guitar work. Corey sings alot more than he used to, not as much screaming. If you'd believe it, there's a few acoustic songs on the album. I must say, Slipknot pulls it off nicely. Especially on \\"Vermilioin pt. 2\\". Slipknot fans won't be disapointed, and if you are a Slipknot hater or not a Slipknot fan by any means, I think you'll be suprised. I'm not too crazy about Slipknot, but I'm very impressed.<br />Standout tracks:<BR>The Blister Exists<BR>Three Nil<BR>Duality<BR>Circle<BR>Welcome<BR>Vermilion<BR>Vermilion pt. 2<BR>The Nameless
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Ok, if you are expecting anything like the first 2 albums you will be greatly disappointed! This is not the same Slipknot. What I was hoping would not happen has... they have gone mainstream and this album is soft! I have been excited for this album for a while now. Don't get me wrong there are a couple good songs but the majority is not what I expected. Listen to the album first before you buy it. If you do not own IOWA yet buy that instead.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I have been an avid slipknot fan since i first heard the first song.  I have been anxiously awaiting the new cd and now that i've heard it i am severely dissapointed.  I amall up for artistic evolution and all that, but ya gotta stay true to what made you in the first place.  If i wanted to hear Stone Sour i'd have bought their cd.  When i want to hear slipknot i want to hear slitting your throat and f***ing the wound, not some whining about lettin it build up inside...what happened?
B0001NBMBC|5.0|ok, i knew as soon as i heard it that their so called HARDcore fans were gonna hate this CD, how did i know this you ask, because it has depth. This is not the only brutal, repetatively crushing slipknot of yesteryear(which i liked also, but hey lack of depth is what it is).This CD is one of the best i've ever been graced with the pleasure of hearing. There are so many amazing songs on here it's ridiculous. There are 2 acoustic songs, Circles which i like, and vermillion pt 2 which i don't care for so much, but both show a new side of slipknot that is very refreshing. On the heavier side of things i really like Before I Forget and The BLister Exists and for those of you into to just technical guitar check the into to opium for the masses which starts with a guitar riff that would turn eddie van halens head. Now there are also soft but still not acosutic songs here, in the form of Prelude 3.0 and Danger, Keep Away both of which are absolutely amazing in their ambient feel. If you like depth in you music but still like some heaviness DON'T MISS THIS CD. i'd pay twice what i did for it and still be happy.
B00005JKC3|4.0|No this is nothing like the TV series. But this is a very good movie.<BR>It did take too long to get to see the Hulk, but once you did, it was pretty incredible. I didn't like the jumping thing the Hulk did throughout the movie, but aside from that, I thought it captured the comic book side pretty good (though he doesn't speak excpet for one little line).<BR>The extra DVD has some pretty incredible stuff and even gives you the dimensions of the Hulk based on his anger level.<BR>Overall, this was a pretty good movie and once the movie got rolling, it didn't really slow down (the dog fight scene was very cool).
B00009TB5G|5.0|I'm no Lord of the RIngs fan, but when I saw this version of the film, I thought it was way better than the orginial theatrical version! This is one of the greatest DVD sets ever released, with lot of commentaries and a ton of special features on the third and fourth discs.
B000089CJI|1.0|This girl I was dating listened to the Postal Service, she thought they were a pretty cool band. What's interesting, I told her they have this indie-rock sound about them; an old eighties/early nineties sound. As one of the other reviewers mentioned, they're this indie-electro band--much like Depeche Mode, New Order, OMD, and the Pet Shop Boys--riding a wave of unparalleled success, in the dynamic electronic-underground music scene. If it weren't for the uninspiring vocals on this unimpressive CD, it would've ended up in people's mailboxes all over the world. Unfortunately, the unwilling participants are led to believe this band has any merit, in the unbelievably craptastic way it's put together: It sounds arbitrary, if not ridiculous, as if though some teenage kids got together after school in their garage, hoping someone out there would notice their broad vocal range in some of the songs. It's stripped of any value as far as I'm concerned.
B00000J7SS|5.0|Bitches brew is a revolutionary album. It is not, however, your normal, run-of the-mill jazz album. This album is for mind expansion. This is for you to listen to and try to understand what is being said. Of course if you're not a musically adventureous person, then I warn you, don't get this album.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|I have just recently been turned on to the Strokes after seeing them live.  I liked their song last night when it first came out but I thought they would fade away like most new bands do.  But after going to one of their shows, I can see why their still around.  I'll agree with everyone else that their first album is great, but room on fire doesn't let you down I either.  I would totaly recommend both of their albums if you want to hear some good, simple rock ( not like these retards good charlotte, and yellow card, etc.)
B000002AGM|5.0|Gil is a genius. Miles is a genius. But them together, and you've got a flawless musical entity. I love this album. It is a very beautiful creation of legendary arranger Gil Evans, and equally legendary trumpeter Miles Davis. A must buy for any music fan.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|There will doubtless be many people who will agree with the views of the earlier reviewer who dismisses this album as a &quot;sell out.&quot; Apart from the fact that such a comment is a meaningless statement, it says nothing about the actual music.<BR>Lots of &quot;Metal&quot; fans will share such a narrow appreciation of music and dismiss anything which is not a carbon copy of IOWA or whatever they happen to feel comfortable with. However, if you do truly appreciate music as an art form and not something simply to be worn as a badge of honour for your chosen youth movement, then you will listen to Slipknot's latest (and possibly last release) with total delight.<br />This album displays a warmth previously missing from the Slipknot sound. I love the previous albums however this album covers a range of emotion which is ultimately far more effective than the rather one dimensional out and out rage of their previous work. I personally feel that the tracks on here which are most like the traditional Slipknot sound benefit from being book-ended by slower or more melodic tracks. Whilst some of the previous chaos in the sound has been sacrificied, the heavier tracks take on a more focused aspect.<br />Opinion on this album will be divided and many Slipknot fans will probably listen once and then play only half the album on repeat listens. Slipknot will not care, they know they have made the best album they could and I believe this is an album they deserve to be proud of.
B0001RVTXO|5.0|I'll start this review by saying this CD is brilliant. The pixies combine brilliant guitar sound with clever lyrics and pleasant vocals. If you're already a fan of The Pixies you will love this album, however you won't really need it. Each one of the Pixies' albums is great, and so this CD is an unneccesary attempt at singeling out the best tracks. If you're new to the Pixies, I would definately reccommend this CD as an introduction to their music, before going on to listen to their albums.
B00003CXBK|5.0|The images, story and themes of this exquisite film are all top notch and I am delighted to have it in my collection.  Or to put a more measured value on it:  If I had to choose between the Ring trilogy and Mononoke, I prefer Mononoke.  I loved the 3 Ring movies, but this is art.  I think it is worth the price.<br />The sense of wonder you can get from this film is a lasting one.  Anyone with an open mind and heart will enjoy it immensely and will continue to enjoy it with repeated viewings.  I don't want to start describing it in any more detail, but the film is not for every taste so I'll just say, SEE THIS FILM if<BR>* you're open to eastern traditions and ways of thinking.<BR>* you're open to seeing a great film that doesn't fit into narrow confines of any genre.<BR>* you're an adult who understands that good and evil exists in all of us.<BR>* you're willing to look at greed and violence in thoughtful ways.
B00020HEG6|5.0|Never have I heard John Williams use so many different types of music to score one movie!  Parts of this album will remind you why you fell in love with the Harry Potter scores in the first place, but you'll also hear music that reminds you of the \\"Star Wars\\" Cantina, and the jazzy sounds of \\"Catch Me if You Can.\\"  \\"Aunt Marge's Waltz\\" reminds you of classical music written over a hundred years ago.  The dominating sound of this album, however, can only be described as \\"Medieval.\\"  No songs portray the feel of an old Scottish castle better than \\"Double Trouble\\" (with lyrics from \\"MacBeth\\") or \\"Hagrid the Professor.\\"  Much like he did with \\"Indaiana Jones and the Last Crusade,\\" John Williams reuses his old themes just enough the remind you that it's still the same series.  Easily, 90% of this score is music that you have not heard from the first two films, and in my opinion it is the best \\"Harry Potter\\" score yet.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|I enjoyed the special effects very much but the magic of the first of the series is gone.  We could all identify in Matrix I with Neo struggling to understand, &quot;what is real?&quot;, &quot;what is freedom?&quot;  In this one he wrestles with his development as some kind of assembler code messiah, but it is not well scripted and is just too far out to identify with anymore.<br />And Neo's development is overshadowed by the predictable Hollywood formulas that are thrown at us:  If one Mr. Smith was a great bad guy, we'll just make more of them.  We'll have 30,000 red-eyed, metal octopus monsters instead of 30.  It's not a thoughtful film anymore.  It's the Hollywood answer to the eternal question:  How do we milk this franchise for a few more million bucks?
B00003CY6M|5.0|This is the best romantic comedy I have ever seen! This is really a one to watch!<br />This is a movie that really gives you a lovely love feeling inside of you! With the jazz music at the background, and showing the beautiful romantic side of New York makes this the most lovely romantic movie for me! (And of course Kate Beckinsale) The extras on the DVD are very good to give you an inside look of making the movie.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|When Avril first appeared with &quot;Complicated&quot; back in 2002, everyone was hooked.  The massive air play it received, and when the album &quot;Let Go&quot; came out, we were introduced to Avrils corky, fun-spirited teen side.  Now, however, she trades in that all for dark songs about love, loneliness, and death.  <br />The album &quot;Under My Skin&quot; has really become more of a diary that is personal and emotional to Avril.  Nearly all of the tracks are dark and haunted (&quot;Take Me Away&quot;; &quot;Together&quot;; &quot;How Does It Feel?&quot;; &quot;Nobody's Home&quot;; &quot;Forgotten&quot;; and &quot;Slipped Away&quot;) except for those few that are more upbeat and  energetic (&quot;He Wasn't&quot;, &quot;My Happy Ending&quot;; &quot;Who Knows&quot;; &quot;Freak Out&quot;).<br />The fact that Avril places herself in a new category, far above &quot;Let Go&quot; and breaks the fact that &quot;Let Go&quot; showed her more as Alanis Moresset and not Avril.  &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, however, shows a true artist coming from the heart on nearly the entire album.  Yes, she has traded in her tanktops and ties for ballerina outfits and red &quot;X's&quot; is just one way of showing her growing into her maturity as she reaches 20.<br />BREAKDOWN:<br />1. Take Me Away(3.5/5)- Very appetizing and very great way to start the album.<br />2. Together (4/5)- Though my favorite, kind of sounds like &quot;Losing Grip&quot;.  Still, very good track.<br />3. Don't Tell Me (4.5/5)- First single, very strong and independent.  Really shows what this cd is about.<br />4. He Wasn't (4/5)- One of the very exstatic, energetic musical songs on the cd.  Not my favorite, but good.<br />5. How DOes It Feel (2.5/5)- Really sounds like &quot;Im With You&quot;, and is a little bit boring.  The strings are the saver of the song.<br />6. My Happy Ending (4.5/5)- Will probably be a single.  Another favorite that has energetic, upbeat rock music to it.<br />7. Nobody's Home (3.5/5)- This is my second favorite song on the album.  Its very dark, and its the best ballad of the album.  Very strong song.<br />8. Forgotten- (2/5)- The lyrics are good, but put to the music, they suck.  The song is very discordinated with the vocals.  The worst of the album.<br />9. Who Knows (3/5) Uplifting, alive song.  Its alright, just a song you can listen to, not a single.<br />10.  Fall To Pieces (2.5/5)- Theres just something about the music that makes the song kind of slow to get through.  Hopefully, not a single.<br />11. Freak Out (3.5/5)- Very alive song.  I really like this becuase it defines Avril.  If someone didnt know who she was and listened to this song, you'd get a perfect idea of her personality.  Very alive!<br />12. Slipped Away (4/5)- VERY depressing.  Its about someone dying and it really gives the album a finishing touch.  Another ballad that really showcases mad ability from Avril.<br />Overall, its an appealing album with its ups and downs.  Could use a little more of something here and there, but not bad.<br />GRADE- C+
0156012197|5.0|At first, I thought this book was the strangest book I had ever read. I wondered why I had to read this. I was to old for this! I told myself. However, you don't get the true meaning of the book until you reflect on it. Almost every page has a deeper meaning than first meets the eye. The lessons tought in this book will change your outlook on life, and make you think about life in a different way. I am glad I read this book and would definitly recomend it to everyone, young and old.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril's New album is great and is as good as her last. I am a BIG Avril fan and always will be.<BR>My favourites are - Nobodys home, and Dont tell me.<BR>But they are all good<BR>rock on avril
0767817478|2.0|The one important thing that the producers of GODZILLA failed to address in the film is that Godzilla is supposed to be a force of nature. The original and all the other japanese versions always addressed that fact and all involved in this American version completely missed the point. These were the makers of ID4 who went all out to destroy the world.  Instead of destroying New York City, Godzilla is basically running loose like an unchained dog.  The premise is set up well, if not predictably, with just a slight hint of anti-nuclear message. Also, all the characters are conventional from Matthew Broderick's scientist Dr. Niko Tatopoulos (many thought he was miscast), to Jean Reno as the French Gov Agent (who thinks he can pass as an American by chewing some gum). There is the lame sub-plot of news reporter Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo), being the ex-girlfriend of Tatopoulos/Broderick for sake of a love story. The humor does not fit in with the subject matter (i.e. what's the idea of having characters who look and have the names of Siskel and Ebert doing in the film?).  The CGI is seamless a'la JURASSIC PARK (as all the baby Godzilla's look and act like 'raptors')but the creature itself (Godzilla) has no personality whatsoever.  Overall, a forgettable movie with high production values and a decent cast, but in its final execution, fails miserably. Somehow the original movies with the guys in the rubber suits don't seem as bad.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|From the characters to the special effects to the atmosphere it created, this movie is wonderful!!  The actors are superb and fun to watch as they help to spin this tail on the high seas!  I hope they make another movie!!!
B0000039QA|5.0|Through only two albums, Notorious B.I.G. showcased his amazing lyrical and rhyming talent. The second, Ready to Die, released mere weeks after his tragic murder in Los Angeles, is a double-disk set. One would expect a large amount of filler, but there is surprisingly little on either disk. The mood varies greatly, from the tragic-toned \\"Somebody's Gotta Die\\" to the haunting \\"What's Beef?\\" to arguably my favorite track on the entire album, a song so masterfully described I could picture it as a scene in a crime movie, \\"Niggas Bleed\\". On the lighter side, we have the upbeat \\"Going Back to Cali\\" and the laid-back \\"I Got a Story to Tell\\". As noted elsewhere, Biggie has a very vivid and detailed way of describing the events going on in his songs, so to picture yourself at the events as they happen is surprisingly easy. Overall, this is a solid album, despite being a close to a career that was clearly not over. The Notorious B.I.G. may have had but two albums, but sometimes, that's all it takes.<br />My Top 5 for both discs:<br />1#: Niggas Bleed<BR>2#: You're Nobody ('Til Somebody Kills You)<BR>3#: Somebody's Gotta Die<BR>4#: What's Beef?<BR>5#: Going Back to Cali
1400032717|4.0|With &quot;Dog in the Night-Time,&quot; Haddon delivers an intriguing, and often hilarious, story with a biting wit and a truly unique approach.  If you want to add something out-of-the-box to your summer reading list, &quot;Curious Incident&quot; is for you.<br />If you dig this, and/or you're into writers like Yann Martel, Sue Monk Kidd, Dan Brown, etc., then there's a new writer you should check out: Greg Ippolito.  His new novel, &quot;Zero Station,&quot; is absolutely terrific, and an excerpt is available for FREE.  He's still a relative unknown (a friend turned me onto his work)...but this is a must-read.  You can check him out and read the excerpt at: [...]  Don't miss it!
B00005JMEW|5.0|...and thats why I love it so much. 5 stars.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Vol. 3:The Subliminal Verses is absolutely amazing.  I feel this is their best work yet. Their self-titled debut and Iowa were both masterpieces, but this album will show skeptics once and for all that Slipknot has artistic talent.  Corey maintains his amazing vocals, while not crossing into his Stone Sour form (another amazing band) but still having a great amount of melody in his voice.  Mick and Jim get to show off their phenomenal guitar skills on this album while Joey once again amazes us with his god-like drumming abilities, although Joey's drumming is not as dominant as on the previous albums. I was surprised to find that there is not a single cuss word on the entire album! But cussing is not what Slipknot is about.  They even have some acoustic tracks, which are truly great.  Anyone who cries \\"sell-out\\" is full of sh*t and does not understand that a band must evolve and change.  These people are probably just jerk-offs who listen to Slipknot and wear Slipknot shirts to look cool, they are not true maggots like myself who listen to Slipknot for their musical abilities and not their appearance, even though the masks and jumpsuits are f***ing awesome! This album has no weak points anywhere! This will be the best album you can buy!<BR>Slipknot=God
B00011RPB0|5.0|Ms. Coppola has accomplished a remarkable feat.  First, I know of no other film that captures &quot;jet lag&quot; and its mind-numbing physical effects on the weary traveler.  Second, she gives an example of detachment and the acute introspection that can result.  Bill Murray knows that much of what is being translated for him from Japanese is &quot;lost,&quot; thus resulting in truncated and unsatisfactory communication -- in fact, the absence of communication.  But it is not just the Japanese that alludes him. His interaction, even the long distance calls home, are misunderstood, taken out of context, void of meaning.  The central characters of this film find themselves in Japan and are forced to re-invent or perhaps re-discover themselves.  That is what this film is conveying.  Anyone who has travelled extensively, and faced the long nights away from home will recognize the way the mind works in such instances, will know that there are times when one is uncertain of understanding oneself, let alone the foreign tongues on all sides of you.  This film is a work of stark originality.  At a time when it always seem possible to see the antecedents to every movie -- The Perfect Storm meets Ferris Bueller meets Oceans Eleven -- this work has the distinct advantage of occupying a uniquely creative, first position.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|i dont care wat ever1 else says but i think this cd is excellent.this takes them 2 a whole new step. although they have acoustic songs such as vermillion part2 and circle i think of it just being as metallica cumming out wit noting else matters. all that rock into them they cum out wit a soft song like that.
B000268QB2|5.0|Keane is being hailed as the latest of the Radiohead-influenced bands (Travis, Coldplay, Muse, South, Elbow, Leaves, etc.) to come to America.  However, while the aforementioned bands are more traditional guitar-based rock outfits, Keane employs no guitars on their debut album, &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot;.  Instead they combine percussion, piano and electronic effects to achieve their unique sound...and do it so well that nobody misses the guitars!<br />But there is no question that Keane's silver bullet is the unbelievably sweet falsetto of lead singer Tom Chaplin, which is two parts Jeff Buckley, one part Francis Healy of Travis, one part Thom York of Radiohead and ten parts heaven.  Put that all together and you have a truly stunning voice that is without peer.  Check out the audio samples and you'll see what I mean!<br />What I love about &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; is that it does not sound like typical debut albums, which frequently are uneven as bands try to nail down their sound.  This is a well-produced album from an assured band that is not afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve.  In fact, one of the most impressive things about &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; is the range the band displays here, from heart-tugging ballads (&quot;She Has No Time) to more upbeat toe-tappers (This is the Last Time).  Some numbers are lush and highly-produced (&quot;Everybody's Changing&quot;) while others are quietly acoustic (&quot;We Might As Well Be Strangers&quot;).  <br />This is a band that is talented and versatile enough that they don't need to repeat themselves, and the result is a record that I can listen to over and over again, which is saying a lot.  Definitely keep an eye on Keane.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I bought the album today and have been anxiously awaiting it to be released. I didn't realize that UNDER MY SKIN was going to be more electric than LET GO. But I am not disappointed in the least. Avril's voice, lyrics, and the album's production values are all top notch. The songs all have strong melodies and hit potential. It's going to take me a long time to come up with a favorite song. I love this record!
0156012197|3.0|One thing i liked about this book was that it was short. But the problem was, was this a fairytale or was it a thick complex book that was summerized into pictures and quotes?i was amazed by Antoine de Saint-Exupry because around that time there was a war going on, i beilive it was world war 1 but how could he want to right a book during a time or violance and distractions from almost every part of the world.<BR>     Overall i think this was a simple book with a strong mess to life. i still dont understand the messege and i hope to read the book again in a few years.
B000002KE2|5.0|Black Sabbath. A bunch of un-educated blokes from an industrial wasteland who played simple, mindless music. Really now? You could have fooled me. I'm going to  make another Black Sabbath/ Led Zeppelin comparison (Yes, I apoligize)But nor do I have any desire to put any of these bands down. If anything, it truly benifts both; as it lends a sense of understanding to both of these unique,highly influential, musically gifted bands: In their approach, and there aim. Listening to both bands, Black Sabbath, if anything, tends to be the more jazz-oriented band of the two. Whereas Led Zeppelin is truly more into the blues. Musically, timing and precision meant a great deal to Zeppelin. Black Sabbath on the other hand never really played &quot;in time&quot;. If anything, they were more about the feel of things. And this most certainly determined the out come of a song. A greater comparison can be made ultimately when comparing both band's rythm sections. Sabbath's dummer Bill Ward was no John Bonham, in that he played on time (he didn't). Nor was his playing nowhere near as precise. It wasn't. Ward's playing, tended to be more over the map, more jazzy, in that he would time and time on add numerous, unique fills, that at times, wouldn't be needed. He was a very unothodox drummer. Just as Gezzer Butler was somewhat of an unorthodox bass player, in that he really didn't play a bass like a bass, but like a rythm guitarist (which he was before he learned to play the bass) unlike Zeppelin's John Paul Jones, who was by all means your standard bass player. Nothing wrong with this, as Jones was a superb bass player (Led Zeppelin II was clearly his album, and shining moment) Diversity is another issue: Which band played more diverse material? The answer: Both Bands. Though, Zeppelin might've beat them by one (folk ala Led Zeppelin III) But as &quot;Black Sabbath Vol.4&quot; would prove (as well as their next few albums), Sabbath were certainly intrested, and capable of not just playing other tpyes, other styles of music, but they were in a way, far more (than Zeppelin) successful at incorporating these other styles into their  sound. Proof? Well not only were Sabbath more conservative in their views of music, but it certainly might take a few people a while to point out the various musical touches, styles, and genres buried in Sabbath's signature sound. Where as Zeppelin's attempts were far more in your face, and at times, rather hamfested(Houses of the Holy, anybody?). Both bands of course went into two different directions, as Sabbath become interested in adopting progressive arrganments into their mix. And Volume 4 was their first attempt at such an experiment. (Was it a 100% success? IF anything, it's a yes &amp; no) At the same time, they began branching out musically. As VOLUME 4 incorporates blues, jazz (Cornucopia), pop(St. Vitues Dance), boogie (Supernaut), psychodelia (Wheels of Confusion), and even latin beats(!) (which can be found imbeded through the second half of Snowblind, Cornucopia etc) into their sludgy mix (under the sun) Lyically, this album represents the point when Sabbath stopped being preachy, and became more introspective ( an approach that become far more successful on their next two albums) VOLUME 4, also perfectly showcases Sabbath's most drug-heavy period. As this is evidence through the music, and, well, the production. Which if anything, is really the only negative thing for the album: As it's probably (audio-wise) the most poorly mixed and produced of the original Sabbath albums. As Geezer Butler's bass is sadly, at times, buried in the mix. Not even the recent release and remasters of the Black Box have really done it justice. Though, the quality has been immensly cleaned up. It was the producer's (and Iommi's) poor decision to tune out the bass so much. On the plus side, you have some of Tony Iommi's best ever guitar work, riffing, and solos. And perhaps what is drummer Bill Ward's finest hour - as his arragments and fills at times prove to be truly mind-blowing and  the best of any Sabbath album.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|if you didnt like this album just because it has more melody and just because corey doesn't scream quite the same, then you very well may be what most call closed-minded. this album displays the talent and style that slipknot is known for. it also shows how eclectic slipknot is. i think they have changed since the beginning, but that's definitely a good thing. why would you want every album to sound the same? why would you want every album to sound like mate feed kill repeat? you wouldnt. its all about what message the artist wants to promote. also to speak on my behalf, as a long time slipknot fan, i was surprised that they could come out with an album without it being parental advisory. i was blown away to find out how little profanity this album put out, especially compared to the last two albums. sell out album or not...every song included is tight as hell!
B000084T18|4.0|I didn't want to like 50 cent because:<BR>1. People said he sounded like Mase.<BR>2. All I heard about first was his rep and not his rap.<BR>3. I thought he was taking unprovoked sniper shots at established rappers in order to sell records.<BR>4. I heard &quot;How to rob&quot; and I just wasn't impressed.<br />After listening I realize this is no Mase, and he is not taking shots at the rappers I thought he was. (Only Ja Rule) He actually respects them.  I think 50 has a very spiritual side to his album, like &quot;The Fix&quot;. I think his album is really well rounded for his first nationally released album.  He had battle ryhmes, gansta rap, pimp raps, dance music. <br />I think the West coast beats with the southern accent, and the New York lifestyle and subject matter makes this the first truly BI-COASTAL hip hop album.  <br />This is also one of the best battle records since the Nas and Jay-Z war. <br />I'd like to see him a see the next album have a couple uplifting songs with some positive overtones as some of the greats tried to do. (Tupac, Nas, Biggie, and even Eminem) I'd like to hear him rep his hood little (I've listened to this album 100 times and I still don't know where he is from) or maybe get a little metphorical on some songs.  Those are the only things missing from this album.  If it had those things it would be 5 stars.  Although for you it may be 5 stars.  If you like battle raps, and gansta raps with good production value buy this.  <br />50 Thank you for resurecting gangsta rap.  It needed new life.  Really bad.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|I was by no means an Alicia Keys fan until I bought &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; not long ago (yeah i was kinda late) &amp; fell in love with her voice &amp; style. So as soon as this album dropped, i had to get it. <br />Alicia Keys is more talented than any female in the business, with the exception of Christina Aguilera. She's pretty, smart, and won't take anyone's crap, &amp; it comes off in her music. But &quot;Diary...&quot; lacked all that much versatility. There's only so far that a piano can take you. <br />&quot;Diary...&quot; is pretty bland. There are some great tracks: Karma, You Don't Know my Name, Dragon Days, (Harlem's Nocturne...an intro, i know), but then there are some bad ones: Diary, So Simple, Samsonite Man, etc. <br />This CD is pretty good, but for every good song, there's a bad one. Still, it's a solid buy, better than most of the garbage in our industry. <br />So I'd suggest picking it up, especially if you think commercial garbage like Britney Spears is music. This is what real music should sound like. It's not great (not even as good as Songs in A Minor), but it's not bad.
B000003TAR|5.0|i think that overall this is the best nirvana album of all time, just because of the brilliant songs on here. i think that the best is probably pennyroyal tea, its a very nice song with some nice lyrics. there is also a hidden track on european releases of the album which is called &quot;gallons of rubbing alcohol through the strip&quot; which goes on for ages but is still quite good never-the-less!! there is really only one song on here that is a sort of mellow track and its called &quot;dumb&quot;. i think that there is better songs on this album than the songs that are on &quot;nevermind&quot; i just cant say how good this album is in words i just say that u really should go out and buy it<BR>R.I.P Kurt Donald Cobain 1967 - 1994
B00006BTCA|5.0|this album is so damn amazing, i just dont know what to say.  every single song can be a hit.  the beats, the vibes, all seem to come together in such perfect harmony that by the time you finish listening to the songs, it seems more like poetry than anything else.<br />i've been listening to this album for more than a year now and it still hasn't gotten old.  the song NYC is so haunting, yet so beautiful.  the way he describes the city in such vague terms only signified the problem i've always had regarding the big apple: its so vast, so diverse, yet...i've never understood it.  its endless.
B0000025KI|2.0|In the 70's Bruce released 3 masterpieces, all completely different from one another. The Wild The Innocent, Born To Run, Darkness On The Edge Of Town. 3 practically flawless, mature paintings - everything you could want in an album. I was convinced Bruce could do no wrong. And then this thing came out. There are quite a few good songs on The River, maybe even a couple great ones. But what makes this album a real clunker is the sheer number of half-baked, mind-numbing, happy-crappy pop songs. The man who gave us Incident On 57th St, Thunder Road and Darkness on The Edge of Town now presents us with Crush On You, I Wanna Marry You, I'm A Rocker, Ramrod, and a few others which I thankfully can't remember now. This stuff is bad for you. bad. bad. Listen to Blood On The Tracks twice and call me in the morning.
0783225970|5.0|Scarface has got to be one of the most entertaining and surreal ganster movies ever made. Al Pacino is excellent in this movie as is the supporting characters. This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over.<BR>Quite simply, words can't express the complete visual and audio experience this movie exhudes. If you enjoy high powered gangster movies then you need to see this.
1400034205|5.0|Rarely can a book truly pull you in from the moment you commence reading.  Well, The Razor's Edge is the exception to the rule.  It is not only the mark of a good book, but a sublime storyteller.  The incredible combination of an extraordinary melange of remarkably eclectic and certifiably unforgettable characters, a masterfully woven premise of singular quality, as well as a suave and melodious prose that virtually flows off of the page all emanate early and often from Maugham's pen in The Razor's Edge.<br />While much has been made of the inscrutable idealist Larry Darrell, I found myself equally fascinated by the beautiful, yet cold and predictable Isabel, the banality of everyman Gray, the irrepressible flair of Elliott Templeton, the vague goings-on of Maugham, and, last but not least, the expressly antithetical, yet similarly intriguing, tales of Suzanne Bouvier and Sophie Macdonald. What makes The Razor's Edge so engrossingly captivating is the dichotomy of Maugham employing himself as the first person narrator and the irrefutable fact that the book draws from a vast multitude of his personal experiences -- both of which add immensely to the verisimilitude of the experience.  In short, it has the feel of a memoir of sorts -- a true testament to Maugham's genius.<br />&quot;He's the idealist, he's the dreamer of a beautiful dream, and even if the dream doesn't come true, it's rather thrilling to have dreamt it.&quot; - Maugham
B0000YEEGM|5.0|\\"Rain Man\\" reigned in the 1988 \\"Best Picture\\" Academy Award, and deservedly so.  This film is everything a \\"Best Picture\\" Oscar winner should be, in my view.  It has tenderness, romance, drama, compassion, likeable characters, and a biting humor as well.  It's a \\"road\\" picture, while at the same time encompassing so many other things too.<br /><br />Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman give highly-memorable and powerful performances in \\"Rain Man\\".  Some of the moments in the movie that I find particularly memorable (and deserving of multiple replays whenever loading this up into the DVD Player) include these ............<br /><br />> The first meeting between \\"Charlie\\" and \\"Raymond\\", when Charlie finds Ray behind the wheel of his rare 1949 automobile (excellent \\"first meeting\\" of these characters).<br /><br />> The \\"shorts on the highway\\" scene.<br /><br />> \\"Qantas never crashed\\".<br /><br />> The Blackjack scene in Vegas.<br /><br />> \\"I like having you for my big brother\\".<br /><br />This \\"SE\\" release of \\"Rain Man\\" includes an enhanced (anamorphic) 1.85:1 Widescreen version of the movie -- and it gets an A+ on my \\"PQ Report Card\\".  The digital video is beautiful throughout, with radiant colors.<br /><br />The audio comes through loud and clear via the disc's bold English 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround track.  Two foreign-language DD tracks are also part of this DVD -- a 2.0 Surround in French, and a Spanish 2.0 Mono track.<br /><br />The DVD Special Features are a wee bit on the light side for a so-called \\"Special Edition\\".

Three separate filmmaker Commentary Tracks are featured on this one-disc \\"SE\\", including one by Director Barry Levinson.<br /><br />Other bonus material includes ..........<br /><br />>> Original Featurette. -- This short bonus is fairly thin on content, but does provide a few comments from stars Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise (circa 1988).  Not much to sink your \\"Making Of\\" teeth into here though.  The video for this featurette is Full Frame (1.33:1). Length = 6:55. .... It would have been nice to have had a feature-length \\"Making-Of\\" documentary included on this \\"SE\\" DVD.  But, maybe next time.<br /><br />>> One Deleted Scene. -- I kind of liked this. This excised scene shows Raymond entering a convenience store, where he begins helping himself to the store's stock of food and beverages (to the dismay of the shop's proprietor). Charlie enters at the end of this short scene to \\"rescue\\" Raymond.  It's a pretty good scene, but certainly not essential to the storyline; and I can see why it was cut.  Especially considering the film's already-lengthy 134-minute final running time.  This deleted clip lasts 2:01, and is presented in 1.33:1 Full-Frame ratio.<br /><br />>> Original Theatrical Trailer. -- A fun and funny trailer. Shown in 1.33:1. Run time -- 2:14.<br /><br />>> Photo Gallery. -- This Gallery (which *is* anamorphic) is broken up into five different segments.<br /><br />>> Bonus DVD Trailers.<br /><br />No \\"Chapter List\\" paper insert is included with this DVD.  The case looks kind of bare without any insert, I must admit.  But, starting in late 2003 (approx.), many studios began to go the \\"el-cheapo\\" route on us, and no longer provide physical paper enclosures inside the DVD cases anymore. Gee, you'd think a \\"Special Edition\\" release would at least warrant a slim, one-page insert. Oh, well...what are ya gonna do?  No biggie really.  But I'd still prefer to have an insert for all DVD releases (even if it's only an ad for other DVD products).<br /><br />Even with the rather skimpy selection of supplements here, this DVD still comes highly recommended by this \\"Rain Man\\" fan.

B00004T8RK|4.0|After &quot;Vs.&quot; and before &quot;Yield&quot;, Pearl Jam kind of dissapeared for a while.  They'd pop up from time to time on the radio, but rarely in heavy rotation, and unless you were specifically a fan of the band, you wouldn't even have known that Pearl Jam was still making music.<br />Vitalogy, No Code, and Binaural are the three parts to Pearl Jam's experimentation triangle.  They had succeeded with the mainstream audiences with the classics &quot;Ten&quot; and &quot;Vs.&quot;, now it was time to write something for the fans.  &quot;Vitalogy&quot; was loud rock; &quot;No Code&quot; was epic, melodic, and timeless; and &quot;Binaural&quot; is one-of-a-kind.  It marked the bands return to radio with the haunting &quot;Nothing As It Seems&quot;, which accurately portrays the overall feel of the album.  Other stand-outs include &quot;Insignificance&quot;, &quot;Light Years&quot;, and &quot;Thin Air&quot;.  Anyone who has enjoyed the other two albums from this phase of the bands career would do very good to check out this masterpiece.  It is music that only Pearl Jam could ever create.  And god bless them for it.
0486278077|5.0|This fascinating story of extreme narcissism and moral dilemna provides food for thought on the author's strange and sometimes twisted views on society as played out by the characters. This book provides a deep pessimism which ultimately corrupts innocense in the end. rather a strange, but interesting novel to say the least
B000002UJQ|5.0|Greatest album of the 90's.  Period.  Radiohead had a mission when they recorded OK Computer, and it was accomplished.  From the time that &quot;Airbag&quot; begins to the time that &quot;The Tourist&quot; ends, the listener is introduced to a world that couldn't exist anywhere but on a Radiohead album.  The songs are epic, they're melodic, they're ironic, they're comical (one of the most complex and digitized albums ever recorded is ended by the DING of a single triangle)... this recording is brilliant, and will be the inspiration of many in the years to come.
B000002JEV|5.0|I have all three Zeppelin live CDs. &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; (Very underrated, and unappreciated in my opinion), &quot;How The West Was Won&quot;, and &quot;BBC Sessions&quot;, and this CD, is by FAR is the best of the bunch (I would rank it only behind Zeppelin 4 and &quot;Physical Grafitti&quot; as far as overall Zeppelin CDs are concerned). First off, it has unreleased Zeppelin songs such as &quot;Girl I Love She Got Black Wavy Hair&quot;. Next it has the FIRST performance of &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; (This was performed BEFORE Zeppelin 4 was released). And finally, it has the most neglected Zeppelin song of all time: &quot;What Is And What Should Never Be&quot; from Zeppelin 2. Simply put, for now, it is the best live Zeppelin CD to date, and a must have for ANYONE who likes Zeppelin at all.
B000002AZ8|4.0|This album is great.  To any Pearl Jam fan who enjoyed &quot;No Code&quot; and &quot;Binaural&quot;, this repesents the (for the most part) heavier side of the triangle.  I've always held those three albums in slightly higher regard than the rest of the Pearl Jam studio library (No Code is, in my opinion, the best of the three), because they showcase Pearl Jams overwhelming talent, and ability for being able to play with all these new sounds, while still maintaining that basic Pearl Jam feel.  Not a lot of bands can get away with that kind of experimentation, but Pearl Jam does.  Buy this album with No Code and Binaural, and buckle your seatbelt, it's a hell of a ride.
B000002JSN|5.0|This CD is one of the best in the history of music, as far as rock is concerned, only Zeppelin 4, and &quot;Who's Next?&quot; surpass it. &quot;Kashmir&quot;, &quot;Houses Of The Holy&quot;, and my favorite Zeppelin song &quot;Trampled Under Foot&quot;, are on side one, and it makes this CD a must have alone. The rest of disk one is not far behind.  I cannot believe people writting in here being so negative towards it (They must be angry Who or Stones fans, who hate the fact that Zeppelin is viewed over them). As far as Zeppelin CDs are concerned here are my rankings:<BR> 1: Zeppelin 4: &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;, &quot;Black Dog&quot;, &quot;Rock And Roll&quot; etc.<BR> 2: Physical Grafitti.<BR> 3: BBC Sessions: Best live CD EVER except &quot;For The Last Time (George Strait).<BR> 4: Zeppelin 2: EVERY song but &quot;Thank You&quot; and &quot;Lemon Song&quot; are 10/10.<BR> 5: Houses Of The Holy: Title track, &quot;The Rain Song&quot;, &quot;Dancing Days&quot; etc.<BR> 6: Song Remains The Same: Killer versions of &quot;Stairway&quot;. &quot;Celebration Day&quot; and &quot;The Rain Song&quot;, excellent &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;.<BR> 7: Zeppelin 1: &quot;Communcation Breakdown&quot;, &quot;Babe I'm Gonna Leave You&quot;, &quot;Good Times, Bad Times&quot; etc.<BR> 8: How The West Was Won.<BR> 9: In Through The Out Door: &quot;In The Evening&quot;, &quot;Fool In The Rain&quot;, &quot;All Of My Love&quot;.<BR> 10: Zeppelin 3: The most overated Zeppelin CD EVER, best song &quot;Immigrant song&quot; is better live. (Has the WORST non-Coda Zeppelin song: &quot;Hats Off To Roy Harper&quot;<BR> 11: Presence&quot; Only Achillies Last Stand&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot; are worth the money.<BR> 12: Coda: Nothing on it that justifies the cost.<BR>  Finally, this CD should be in ANY rock fan's collection, because NO artist out today can touch it.
B000002LIX|5.0|This is it, right here.  To anyone who holds that \\"rock achieved perfection in the 70's\\", you'd do good to check these guys out.  The psychedelic feel of the album, combined with the masterful guitar work of Dave Navarro has come together to complete something that fans of Pink Floyd and Ozzy will be able to enjoy.  Similarily, any fan of modern alternative music (Red Hot Chili Peppers, Incubus) should check out this album, because it is undoubetdly a favorite, and an inspiration, of whatever your listening to now.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|My favorite song is Slipped away.  The majority of the songs on this album are very deep.  It truely shows how much she has matured year the years.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I found it to be intresting that they took a differant approach to this album, but they have always said that every album would be diffrent from them. It is not as heavy as Iowa but it falls more as a mixture of stone sour and their first album. I truely was hoping it would of been like Iowa. This is not a heavy album so if that is what you are looking for than don't buy this album!!!
B0001KL5DA|5.0|After so much waiting, the second series of this continously addictive to watch HBO finally gets it's DVD and this is not only a season that holds it's own against the high standards set in the first year, but actually manages to surpass it with thirteen truly electrifying episodes. From Nate's AVM plot thread, the arrival of Lisa (with child) and Brenda's sex addiction, Six Feet Under firmly proves why it's the best drama on the box just of late. Other noteworthy events includes David and Keith's reunion, only ratcheted by Karla's arrest and the boys \\"adopting\\" Taylor, Claire finally getting out of  high school and giving Gabe the heave ho and Ruth's relationship with Nikolai and little Maya's arrival. Episode highlight definitely include the opener and finale (In The Game and The Last Time), Christmas themed episode It's The Most Wonderful Of The Year when the Fisher clan and Federico (still a little underused here) commemorate Nathaniel's passing, The Secret with Brenda's trip with Melissa to the Orange County and penultimate number I'll Take You where Nate and Brenda are finally forced to confront one another as well as Ruth's foul mouthed encounter with a self-help guru in The Plan and David's brief dalliance with public defender Ben in The Invisible Woman. On the extra front, it's pretty samey, but at least there are more episode commentaries here than season one, and let's face it while this show hasn't produced a bad season in it's run, this is by far the best of the bunch. Enjoy.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Charles Foster Kane; welcome to Xanadu the biggest fortress ever built. That opening sequence in which we feel inmediatly the presence of the purest sense of the german expressionism, gives us one of the multiple clues who will give Orson Welles, this legend name in the cinema story.<br />Ths story is told brilliantly for Welles; the way Welles introduces to the world of Kane is through a new who informs us about the death. Warning about this point because Kane will never be telling his life in first person, but through all those knew him in a far or close distance. In this sense Welles, cleverly gives us a huige puzzle that you as viewers must arrange , and thanks to all his countless devices, at the end of the film when you finally discover what Rosebud means , you leave your seat convinced you're a private eye; but rememeber what Welles said once about Rosebud: it just was Freud for one dollar.<br />And this bitter opinion is due the fact that Rosebud means the iodea of something that never reached the complete process of growing up; a flower who never became the best of itself; I mean this point is remarkable because the sense of unfinishness is what Kane means ; nor more either less.<br />In fact Kane is a man who had everything he wanted; except just one thing; his stolen youth and the dreams contained in this unique stage of the life; the world needed just before he reached his twenty years old and made from him a man before the time comes.<br />That's why you can understand his outrageous character; and thanks to The Inquirer he can expand his biological time and in a certain way to try to live his lost years.<br />When he meets to Marian in that funny water accident; he confess her another clue; both of them are surrounded and involved by the loneliness even they are so distant in his respective social status.<br />And all his efforts walk in this direction. Remember by instance, the smart answer pronounced by Kane in a very special inflexion point of the story: &quot;I'm all what you hate&quot; .<br />Kane loves challenging the world, in every little detail; he plays with it and &quot;no matter if he losses one million dollars each year , because he would lose all his fortune in Sixty years&quot;.<br />All his life turns around the sophistication, the greatness and above all to be remembered and loved or hated but never pass away by a sense of indifference. And this is an important issue, because there's a shakesperian mood in this point of view.<br />How can you translate the shakesperian spirit of glory and trascendence into a raising democatric country and also the new raisng empire of the world.<br />That impplies all his outrageousness; the expensive parties; the employement of the deepness of field which lets you watch the secondary planes just beside the first; remeber that dramatic sequence in which Welles and Cotten walk in the newspaper room.<br />The camera works at the floor level; another clever device of Welles; I think he wants to give us the sensation of being in a theatre hall , and in many ways that resource let add much more dramatism to every take.<br />Greg Tolland made an unfirgettable work behind the camera; because this film demands of you that the images through the travellings , dollies and objective use be another actor in this play.<br />The monumentality all along his achievements is obviously a consequence of his character; that justifies the fact of trying Marian be the greates prima voice female in the Opera ; (however; in the deep of his soul and his mind he knows she'll never reach that goal; but once more he's challenging the world)<br />Remember what Oscar Wilde said once:  &quot;The difference between a caprice and a passion who remains all the time of one life; is the caprice remains for a longer time&quot; .<br />This film will be always a must for all the viewers of any age and as well as Bach , Mozart or Beethoven music or the Michelangelo works or Vermeer paintings , due hismythical essence; such its own force for transforming every time you watch them; but the question is Who really transforms: you , the work of both of two?<br />Orson Welles (1915-1985) still continues being a refernce point for many film makers , great or minors ; and to name his contributions would surpass certainly the permitted limit of this review.<br />A film is really good, when the camera is an eye in the mind of a poet, undoubtly a wise sentence of Orson Welles.<br />It's time for all those people who still hadn't watched this movie that literally is a must to make it.<br />A masterpiece in the widest sense of the word.wn force for transforming every time you watch them; but the question is Who really transforms: you , the work of both of two?<BR>Orson Welles (1915-1985) still continues being a refernce point for many film makers , great or minors ; and to name his contributions would surpass certainly the permitted limit of this review. <BR>A film is really good, when the camera is an eye in the mind of a poet, undoubtly a wise sentence of Orson Welles.<BR>Its time for all those people who still hadnt watched this movie that literally is a must to make it.<BR>A masterpiece in the widest sense of the word.
B000002NBY|5.0|...and this was the principal reason I dug out this CD after 10 years of not hearing it.  I vaguely remembered the way the horns and fiery African percussion lifted my spirits, and was willing to try anything.<br />Well, happy to report success.  This CD is just magnificent.  From &quot;Boy in the Bubble&quot; (a song about the triumph and tributes of an increasingly small world) to &quot;Homeless&quot; (a beautiful acapella) to &quot;Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes&quot; (my personal favorite).  I dare you to listen and not be moved...figuratively, but also literally (hands and feet will involuntarily move).<br />The resuscitation has led to a full on revival in my house.  I've listened to Graceland dozens of times in the last few weeks.  If you've never heard this CD, count yourself lucky and buy immediately.  If it's been a while since your last listen, consider putting back in the player.<br />Also consider loading up &quot;Rhythm of the Saints&quot; (a follow up album to this one that finds Paul Simon in Rio borrowing from some of Brazil's best musical talents); another brilliant CD.<br />Hope this was helpful.<br />Christian Hunter
B000002I2G|5.0|This album is the most ravishing and inspired of that band. Wild child for instance is filled with ooriginal accents; Teel all the people is a classic and touch me is the most emblematic theme of this band one step behind of vourse his mythical song Light my fire; manzarek was never best ; and the rapture in the voice inflexions of Jim Morrison are first rate; Wishful sinful is simply fabulous; but for me The soft parade is a song that you may well compare with the advenced ideas exposed without restrictions with The low spark of high heeled boys from Traffic. Both of these themes are one thousand years light from the standard in that moment. The lyrics and the twists of rhytm are filled of originality and frehness.<br />A superb work and one of these albums simply magical due that shows once more why The doors is a legend band.<br />When I was back in the seminary school...<br />Don't miss one.

B00003CXC6|5.0|Rashomon is a masterpiece. This film shows us a hard statement that maybe disagree to many people; the truth doesn't exist. We see always fragments of it no matter how old you are.<br />Aesop in his fables states: in every man always there are three ; that who he thinks he is; what other people think he is and finally that one who really is. In that sense Goethe talked about four levels of the reality; lineal, literal, methaporical and finally the cosmic.<br />In what level are you when you assume the judgement about a fact?<br />Remember his beliefs are always relative; your ethical world depends about a lot of issues; such as your social status; your religion; your birthplace; your culture and even your age; so be careful when you say are in possesion of the absolute true.<br />And that's what the movie shows us; a terrible murder; five persons state about the fact ; and before you five different versions are given. So, the questions is; who of these persons is lying and who is true?<br />All of us have a sight blind; and because of this you may agree with some of these people; and your close friend or even your couple may be perfectly disagree with you.<br />The reasonable doubt is a very well konwn device employed by all the lawyers in their cases . Indeed, this term inspired to Sidney Lumet for making his opera prima &quot;Twelve angry men&quot; in 1957.<br />Back to Rashomon we find to Akira Kurosawa in one of his major achievements. The handle camera is superb; and this is the first film in the story where , by the first time the camera shows us the sun; a brilliant methapor and also a challenging aaproach by this master director.<br />Mesmerizing ; unforgettable ; you'll be shocked every time you watch. Remember what the woman says uin a sequence: &quot;The men lie because they are weak&quot;.<br />And this point is remarkable, just because the fragile human condition; the human being always will keep his dignity, pride and a set of values above all the odds; and through this process, the truth is always put in a second place, by obvious reasons.<br />Heissenberg established the uncertain principle in 1930 and this review is far to explain about this issue, but what it deserves to call your attention at the time you say ; I found the truth; or even worst; I represent the truth.<br />This procedure is typical of dictatorial regimes; the state is me and other similar statements reveal a syntom of being out of the life and even the nature, a wise mind always thinks and acts; after rethinks and reacts; but never remains quiet.<br />Kurosawa adapted this film from a novel from the same title  Rashomon from 1927 written by Yabu no Naka.<br />This film is a wonderful exploraton of truth and human weakness.<br />In fact this film is watched and analyzed in Post Grade School of Management, for purposes related with another goals.<br />This film was remade in 1964 as Outrage for Martin Ritt, where Paul Newman plays the role of Toshiro Mifune in the original version.<br />A true landmark. Don't miss it.<br />A superb classic!his process, the truth is always put in a second place, by obvious reasons.<BR>Heissenberg established the uncertain principle in 1930 and this review is far to explain about this issue, but what it deserves to call your attention at the time you say ; I found the truth; or even worst; I represent the truth. <BR>This procedure is typical of dictatorial regimes; the state is me and other similar statements reveal a syntom of being out of the life and even the nature, a wise mind always thinks and acts; after rethinks and reacts; but never remains quiet.<BR>Kurosawa adapted this film from a novel from the same title  Rashomon from 1927 written by Yabu no Naka.<BR>This film is a wonderful exploraton of truth and human weakness.<BR>In fact this film is watched and analyzed in Post Grade School of Management, for purposes related with another goals.<BR>This film was remade in 1964 as Outrage for Martin Ritt, where Paul Newman plays the role of Toshiro Mifune in the original version.<BR>A true landmark.

B0000A118M|5.0|I have tried many times to describe this album to others but have failed with fumbled words and detached phrases. I believe the reason why is, this is the type of music that touches something deeper than your ears or mind.<br />Admittedly I am far from a religious person, but spirituality is a different matter, and this album is truly a spiritual experience. Coltrane was filled with a spirit that transcends time and place and removes the listener from all material entanglements thus allowing a freedom seldom provided outside of meditation. A pure form of unspoken language in a private conversation, personal and accesible.<br />To think that four individuals can come together to make a piece of this magnitude gives hope to all. Very few albums will receive 5 stars from me but this album is a no-brainer.<br />If anything buy this album simply to have it...because unlike others, I believe every house needs A Love Supreme inside.
B00005JLEU|4.0|I had went into this movie with some apprehention. I am not an anime fan. I honestly detest the genre with a passion but this movie was nothing less than stunning. The art was still in the traditional anime style but it was so lush. This was one of the most surreal movies I have ever seen.<br />The characters were wonderful and were filled with a certain kind of depth. Daveigh Chase was amazing as the voice of Chihiro; the main protagonist. <br />But there were so many visuals that left an impression. I loved seeing trains that runned on water and flying oriental dragons. I like seeing babies as giants and a ghost that ate everything and became what he ate. Complete eye candy.
B00000DOYH|5.0|Physical Graffiti is perfect for anyone, even if you're not a hardcore Zeppelin fan. Led Zeppelin experimented, took a chance, and ended up creating a masterpiece. The songs range from heavy metal with a middle eastern feel, like the epic \\"Kashmir,\\" to island rock--\\"Down by the Seaside,\\" to the blues metal that Zep practically invented. A bluesy shuffle--\\"Boogie With Stu\\"--is also thrown in. \\" In My Time of Dying\\" is the best on the album if you have some big speakers and room for some headbanging. From the distorted \\"wah\\" of Jimmy Page's guitar to the the single word ending (cough) this track is a classic. If you are looking for just plain good listening, \\"Ten Years Gone\\" is great as well.<BR>     <BR>Jimmy Page's dynamic guitar playing, Plant's shrieking but sometimes soft vocals, Jones' blended bass playing, and Bonham's impressive drumming brings all these musical themes into a flowing, almost perfect album. Even after you have listened to the album many times, you still find new amazing musical accomplishments hidden deep within the initial and obvious rhythmic melodies.
B000002BQK|4.0|Long story short:Mariah and Tommy divorce,Mariah writes about it,Mariah makes the best effort of her career to this day.I know what you Mariah skeptics are thinking:\\"Can Mariah really make a great album?\\"But this album can even make skeptics turn into Mariah fans.First of all,the lyrics are simply beautiful,and while they are a tad bit too safe,they are still from Mariah's heart and of course,mostly directed towards her rocky relationship with Columbia CEO Tommy Mottola.But the best song lyrically on here is not about Mariah's relationship with Mottola;\\"Close My Eyes\\",which took Mariah four years to write,is about Mariah's rough childhood and is undoubtedly the most beautiful song on this album,and the four years were worth it.Other notable writing includes the sad yet true \\"Outside\\" and the tearjerking title track.And,like everyone knows,Mariah uses tons more R&B and hip-hop on this album,and this really is Mariah's best work to date,producing-wise.\\"Babydoll\\" is great in it's unique R&B/Funk sound,and \\"Breakdown\\" is definitely one to dance to,which is weird for being a Mariah song.\\"Fourth of July\\" is also a song to love.And,sure,most of the album has ballads like every other Mariah album,but unlike Mariah's previous albums,you can't help but feel that the ballads have more of an urban feel to them,two examples being again the funky \\"Babydoll\\" and her best cover yet of Prince's \\"The Beatufiul Ones(featuring than famous Dru Hill\\",which is undoubtedly the best ballad on the album,next to the latin-guitar flavored heartbreak anthem \\"My All\\",which still remains one of Mariah's best singles to date.But the track that is above the rest(the highlight) is the unbelievably catchy \\"Honey(co-produced by now-.P.Diddy)\\",which is really my personal favorite and every critic's favorite track off the album,as far as I'm concerned.The album may take a lot of samples,but it is still a greatly original song for Mariah,and has a fun,upbeat,hip-hop flavored sound to it.And,of course,Mariah's voice is great AND she doesn't exaggerate her voice as much,a lot more vulnerability and beauty was put into this album,vocal-wise.Fans will love the sexy cooing Mariah does on this album(i.e.,the wonderfully sensual \\"Fourth Of July\\")<br />Though most of the album's producing is amazing,some of the producing is a little off(\\"Outside\\" sounds a little two-bit;\\"Fly Away{Butterfly Reprise}\\" really does the capture Mariah trying a little too hard;\\"Babydoll\\" may have great producing,but also does have a little piece of two-bit in it,as well).And one of the songs sometimes slips into the category of \\"sleepers\\"(\\"Whenever You Call\\" is very bland).Instead of those minor stepbacks,this is still a great album!<br />The Verdict:Mariah's yearning to be her own artist and person(while wearing clothes that should be worn privately) leads to creating one of the greatest albums of it's decade.Deserves to be an \\"Essential Recording(Amazon.Com!)\\"And,like I said,lookin' good,Mariah!<br />Recommended:Yes
B00004Y6RO|5.0|This CD is sick. even if you don't like this type of music youn are bound to like either wiat and bleed or spit it out. the drumming by Joey Jordison is insane it is some of the best drumming I've heard in while. and the guitars...they are crazy. some of the best. people think that all they are is screaming till they can't talk. well sorry but your way off. I guess you haven't heard wait and bleed. Corey has skill on vocals just like Joey, Chris and shawn have skills on the drums. Mick and James are amazing at guitar and Paul on bass. Sid on the turntables and you can't forget Craig as sampler. if Craig haden't put the line &quot;here comes the pain.&quot; in the the beginning of (sic) it wouldn't be the same song.
0156027321|5.0|Solid, active writing from Yann Martel makes the pages of Life of Pi fly by.  It is an enchanting survival story with well developed characters and interesting takes on many aspects of life.  The body of the book is very good, but the ending takes Life of Pi into a realm of greatness rarely achieved.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne rocks!!! After I heard the first album, I didn't think that she could get any better.... i have been proved wrong!!! This is an album that I have been able to relate to 100% (I'm a teenager with a loada questions about life and why the hell our society is the way it is)... Lets just get one thing straight - I am no mini avril lavigne with ties and dead straight hair... she just has awesome music and awesome attitudes. Everyone should buy this!
B00007E8V4|5.0|Much more mellow than their previous CD's.  This CD has songs that inspire and songs that get stuck in your head and as always the trademark System of a Down protest songs.  Awsome if slightly hard to understand lyrics.  Listen carefully, Like in Toxicity these songs all have meanings that can only be understood once you study the song.  If you don't own this CD you should go out and buy it and if you do it own it than you know what I'm talking about.
0340827246|4.0|This is a fine cookbook, a nice addition to the series.<br />I was kinda afraid that it was a rip-off of the series, getting a quick buck from the popular series, but no, it is actually a great book, a great addition to the series.<br />The thing I liked is that the book that the characters from the series each have a chapter of themselves in which they explain their vision on food, and give in character recipes.<br />Carmella cooks like a mom, Artie Bucco has typical Italian American restaurant stuff.<br />It's a nice gift for a fan of the series who likes to cook, the food and a nice extra to the series.<br />I tried several of the foodstuffs, and they came out great, a nice addition to my collection of cookery books

6304359217|5.0|If you're a fan of the Warner Bros. cartoons,basketball,or golf,this film is for you. Basketball great Michael Jordan stars in this half-animated feature. At a basketball game,we see Bugs Bunny,Porky Pig,Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd in the audience. To the best of my recollection,Bill Murray and Danny DeVito have cameos in the golf scene(s). We also see Pepe Le Pew,Wile E. Coyote,Road Runner and Speedy Gonzales in this film. The featured song in this film is R. Kelly's &quot;I Believe I Can Fly&quot;,which was on hit parade in the fall of 1996 when this film was released.
0805047905|5.0|Yes, I can recite this book by heart.  Sometimes we leave the colors out, sometimes we shorten it, but it is a bedtime must.  My son likes it when we make the animal noises, too.  Good for animal and color identification.  This is another book that is good for practicing baby sign language.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I was a little leary with this album at first but I like Slipknot so I figured that I would give it a try b/c it was only $10.  I really like it because they are actually expanding.  Do not judge this album based on the first single alone, the rest of the album is so much better than Duality.  This is still METAL, just not AS hard as they used to be.  It is still good.<BR>1.

There are opportunities to identify animals and colors on every page, as well as finding the mouse and his banana.
B000002KKS|5.0|I have to first say that I hesitated for many years to purchase this cd.  I had  the attitude that if Ozzy was singing in Sabbath than it wasn't worth purchasing.  How wrong I was!!!  First, take into consideration the last two Ozzy albums with Black Sabbath, they were well below the standard this band had created with their first 6 offerings.  Heaven and Hell is a far heavier and riff laden album than those two albums.  Tony Iommi almost seems to be reborn on this album.  Some of his best riffs are on this album (Heaven and Hell, Die Young, Children of the Sea).  The album is solid throughout with (maybe the exception of Walk Away).  Ronnie James Dio has his best singing proformance of his career.  Don't make the same mistake I made; go out and purchase this album.  I highly reccommend it to anyone who likes metal.  It is a classic.

1594200106|5.0|The enthusiastic praise and adulation which critics have accorded the english publication of Carlo Ruiz Zafon's first novel, &quot;The Shadow of the Wind&quot;, may trouble the reader who begins the book, worried that little might match his expectations. After all, reviewers who compare a writer's work to a combination of Umberto Eco, or Jorge Luis Borges, or Gabriel Garcia Marquez, or other literary giants, compel the reader to expect to be transported when they open the book.<br />Not to worry.<br />Once started, the single downside for the reader will be knowing that the experience must end. The plot is quite complex, the jacket cover's synopsis will give the reader all he needs to know. The important thing is to read it slowly and carefully.<br />A mystery story, a fairy tale, a love story (actually several love stories), a passion for literature, a treatise on politics, a bawdy tale, with love, hate, courage, intrigue, loss of innocence, humor, cowardice, villainy, cruelty, compassion, regret, murder, incest, redemption, and more.  Add to this delicious mixture characters who come alive, and whose thoughts and feelings you will feel deeply.<br />What a great pleasure to discover; an extraordinary first work, one which towers over the endless and repetative volumes which inhabit today's &quot;Best Seller&quot; lists.  Read it, and become hypnotized.<br />Edward Jawer<br />Wyncote, Pa.<br />ejawer@comcast.net
B0000C7PRY|5.0|Not in the music, in the reviews. [Pay attention]Is artistic merit really based upon personal belief? How many Neal Morse fans suddenly bolted when the message changed? How many of you are willing to bemoan the lyrics because you may not relate to the driving force behind the inspiration? How many of you are no longer Neal Morse fans?<br />I am spinning the CD as I write this, &quot;The Land of Beginning Again&quot; is resonating around my apartment, and I wonder, why? Now, far be it from me to judge anyone, but if you are going to scream, placards raised above your heads, &quot;This is NOT progressive, this is NOT Spock's Beard, this is...well, this is crap.&quot; Shame on you.<br />Is the entire idea that &quot;music is about personal experience, music is expression, music is passion&quot;....is this idea gone? Is it lost on this generation? Can you honestly say that, regardless of your &quot;religious, or non-religious&quot; proclivites, this album is not absolutely astounding? Can you honestly say that this &quot;journey&quot; was not well worth taking?<br />I don't know Neal Morse. I have never met him. Funny thing is, I took this walk with him as I listened to this album initially. And I relished every step. Neal Morse is a mastermind, a child let loose in the proverbial candy store. A wunderkind unleashed. Christian? OH NO...forget the musical merit...leave it behind.<br />I see bias in these reviews. I see personal preference and levels of comfort weighed above artisic merit. Can you [gentle listener] really tell me that because the lyrics my lean toward the spiritual, the entire experience is lost? I beg to differ.<br />Looking back over my collection of progressive music, I can say that this album ranks in the top ten, not just musically but emotionally. _Testimony_ moves me. It motivates me, and it makes me understand what music is. I will continue to be a staunch supporter of Neal Morse, and will purchase ANYTHING that this gifted man touches, regardless. You should too.ss. You should too.
B000268QB2|5.0|Keane is a three-piece (piano, vocal, drum, NO guitarist) from the UK that is one of the best Coldplay/Radiohead/U2 influenced bands to come around. In fact, Hopes and Fears, Keane's debut (which opened #1 in the UK charts last week), is one of the best debut albums I have ever heard from any band. Ever single song is the record is solid, melodic, and catchy, and some are truly exceptional. Lead singer Tom Chaplin's booming voice enables songs like \\"Everybody's Changing\\" and \\"This Is the Last Time\\" to soar.  The best song on the album (and there are many good ones), is the infectious \\"Bend and Break\\" which has a chorus so catchy and rocking you will forget that this band uses no guitars. Overall, Hopes and Fears is an incredible debut from a band you will hear a lot about in the future.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This film is my second favorite movie.  Director Hayao Miyazake has truly reached his zenith with this classic.  Whether you are an anime/animated film fan or not, this film will stir parts of your heart you thought were long jaded.  It is enchanting and enthralling.  There are important lessons about love, courage, and respect for nature, for people of any age.  Chihiro, a typical ten year-old girl, is riding with her parents to their new home.  She is pouting in the backseat.  The parents are sidetracked and the family gets lost in the spirit world.  Her parents are turned into swine.  Chihiro must find a way to set her parents free from the spell.<br />Spirited Away made more money than the Titanic in Japan.  That goes to show how Japanese people were moved by this tribute to their culture. I saw this film twice with a Japanese friend, once with subtitles, once in English.  The dubbed version is just as good as the subtitled one.<br />There are certain aspects of Japanese culture one should know in order to fully appreciate this movie.  The bathhouse Chihiro is employed in is for the kami, or gods, to rest and rejuvenate in.  Bathing is an important part of Japanese culture, much more than it is in the U.S.  Japanese Shinto beliefs believe there is a spirit in everything in nature.  So trooping into the bathhouse and relaxing in the hot tubs are all kinds of spirits: chick kami, radish kami, and many more I couldn't make out.  Spirited Away seeks to point out that though Japan is an ultra-modern culture, it is also ancient, with deep roots in the spiritual world that although Japanese may forget, the spirits remember you.  Anyone from any culture can relate to this movie.  Unfortunately, disrespect of nature is present in all cultures of the Western world.<br />But, as this film shows, nature has a way of finding YOU.
0375433074|1.0|Help me finish this boring book. Stuck on page 200 or so and page after page of some boring town election. He cant create suspense, he can barely stay awake writing his own books. How did anyone finish this book?
B0001NBMBC|2.0|first off, I am not a devout slipknot fan. with that said...<br />The self title album. The blue prints that made slipknot what they are. Catchy and unique.<br />Iowa-Harder, Darker and better....<br />Change is sometimes a good thing but when you totally abandon your roots well this is what you get = Volume 3.<br />To soft! cory's choruses are aggravating and drawn out. 1/3 of this album is experimental. the other 2/3 are decent but nothing special. this is the de-evolution of slipknot. Stonesour influence has inpregnated slipknot and ruined what little credibility this band once possessed.
B00020HEG6|5.0|You remember when you saw ET for the first time and the music rose to that unforgettable magical moment, just as that bicycle silhouette flew across the moon, and shivers ripped down your spine? And remember how the main titles for the Star Wars films always made you jump in your seat and got your pulse going?  Those magical musical moments were John Williams at his best because he got your emotions involved. Well, with *this* score, John Williams does what John Williams does best:  he gets to the emotions.<br />There's \\"Lumos\\" to start things off with its signature mystical strains, and then it falls right into a upbeat waltz that puts a smile on the face- I haven't seen a frame of this movie yet, but William's score is telling the story. Something terrifically quirky and funny is happening, it's in the pep of the woodwinds and the belching horns.<br />Williams takes on fast and funky jazz to epitomize Harry's zany journey on the \\"Knight Bus\\", a terrific choice. There's the quirky, but strangely hum-able \\"Double Trouble\\" with a superb renaissance flavor.  \\"Buckbeaks' Flight\\" is surprisingly powerful and (here's that word again) magical piece that is just ever so quintessentially John Williams.  And then, he returns to the renaissance motif and expands upon it with the sublimely beautiful composition \\"A Window to the Past\\".  It's perhaps the most beautiful piece Williams has done for the Potter films and when the listener realizes what looking into this window of the past means for Harry, the heartaches and injustices he's suffered, this haunting melody is wrenchingly appropriate. This piece in particular, I feel, makes the score shine and also makes it easier to forgive some of the less inspired pieces on the album.<br />It's not William's best film score, but I feel confident that it is certainly his best Harry Potter score. It's a return to form for Williams, because in its one hour and eight minutes of play time, he lets us feel the magic, sadness, joy and wonder of Harry's world.  Which is something *only* Williams could do.
6304288433|5.0|the first halloween is incredible there is no doubt and this great sequel is a bit less in comparison.  Yet, compared to other movies in the horror genre, its a 5.  You know what i always say: &quot;Nighttime is screamtime when Mike myers is around.&quot; Myers is the king of fright, mark my words. This sequel sustains the greatness of its original better than any in the horror genre.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|i agree with most of these posts...it seems as though slipknot has forgotten why they have such a strong fanbase and tried to change their sound...i heard that this was going to be the hardest album yet but that couldn't be farther from the truth...many of the songs sound very &quot;stone-sour-ish&quot;...and this is their last cd?!?!...i've heard that it's better to burn than fade away and this cd is definitely fading away from my cd collection...
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Many people will bash this album as the album that Slipknot &quot;sold out&quot; with, or &quot;went soft&quot; with.  I too thought that to myself upon the first listen.  This could not possibly be the same band that wrote Disastepiece or Eyeless could it?  Well the answer to that is yes and no.  Volume 3 seems like an album that actually had some song writing thought put behind it.  Where as much of IOWA and the self titled albums, albeit good, had a more chaotic frenzied nature of the songs, Vol 3 seems much more focused.  <br />Standout tracks, Blister Exits, Three Nil, Circle, Duality, Vermillion 1 &amp; 2, Nameless and Virus Known As Life. <br />Give the album a chance, you have to get over the fact that it's them playing these songs, but if you can, I guarantee you will be treated to a fantastic metal album.  This would be a great way for them to go out on top of their form.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|You can view this cd two ways, judging by old slipknot standards or seeing that they are progressing.  In the first case this cd is bad due to the lack of heaviness and the addition of an acoustic song (reminiscence of &quot;bother&quot; from Stone Sour).  However, although this is not a good typical &quot;slipknot&quot; cd, it is a great &quot;hard rock&quot; cd. Corey's voice is still amazing and his contrasting loud and soft moments add a different effect to the music (especially in duality).  The guitar playing also seems to have improved, yet Joey seems to be lacking a little in the drums.  Overall this is a really decent cd.
B0001UL7RY|2.0|I really liked Avril when she first came out, but I'm really not impressed with this one.  I feel like she's trying too hard as opposed to being authentic, which I felt more with the first album.  There's nothing that really moves me or stays with me like &quot;Complicated&quot; or &quot;I'm With You&quot;  I dunno, maybe it'll grow on me.  Try Alanis' So-Called Chaos instead.  That's really good pop-rock.
1401300901|5.0|I loved it. Yes, it is chick lit. True, it may not be one of the literary wonders of the world. And yes, it may have clichs- but I loved it. Anyone who has ever been in love needs a reminder not to take that significant other for granted. We all get wrapped up in our daily routines and forget that person may not always be there. Is it so wrong to be reminded to say &quot;I love you&quot; more often?
B0001UL7RY|5.0|this record simply blew me away. avril lavigne's lyrics are so personal and intimate. if all you know of avril lavigne is the stuff you hear on the radio, you don't really know avril lavigne; a lot of these tracks are a lot deeper and more powerful than anything that gets played on pop radio.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I hated &quot;Let Go&quot; to a huge extent, Complicated, Sk8ter Boi, very sterotypical pop disguised by avril's look.<BR>Fortunetly Avril grew over the past 4 years.<BR>This album is actually very pleasing...<BR>It's hard to believe this is Avril. And this is coming from someone who HATED avril. But now her sound is so much darker, sounds from the old &quot;pop&quot; sound to rock. Though the album has a couple of slumps. &quot;Take Me Away&quot; seems like avril is screaming, same for &quot;Together&quot; in the chorus. Other than that, on top of her sound improving, Avril's lyrics have certainly improved.<BR>No more Skater spelled with an 8, nor Boy with &quot;oi&quot;. Overall, I do reccomend this album even if you didn't like avril very much, still take in consideration her new sound. The only song that really sounds like it came off of &quot;Let Go&quot; is &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; which is her at her &quot;avril-est&quot;.<br />1. Take Me Away (4/5)- At first it was sort of odd, with her loud vocals, but It grew on me quickly<BR>2. Together (3/5)- Not so great, but not that bad either.<BR>3. Don't Tell Me (4/5)- Very good &quot;angry-girl&quot; rock popish song<BR>4. He Wasn't (2/5)- Probably the only song that is a tad irratating. The chorus gets old fast.<BR>5. How Does It Feel? (5/5)- Very nice. A darker sound.<BR>6. My Happy Ending (4/5)- Slightly Upbeat song<BR>7. Nobody's Home (5/5)- One of the best songs on the album, very nice lyrics and the tone of the song sets it all.<BR>8. Forgotten(4/5)- Unwanted Part 2. I love her new dark sound. Good song.<BR>9. Who Knows (2.5/5)- This song is way too &quot;Let Go&quot; Avril.<BR>10. Falls to Pieces (3/5)- Ok song<BR>11. Freak Out (3/5)- Like I said, It should be on &quot;Let Go&quot; but appeal to older fans.<BR>12. Slipped Away (5/5)- Dark Ballad. Nic eway to end the album.
B00005RG6B|5.0|This DVD is a must have for the fans of the band, as well as fans of real hard rock/heavy metal, and rock music in general. Fans of Limp Bizkit and similar stuff should be warned that this concert may disappoint them, as this band has a singer, who can actually sing, and the band members, who can play their instruments. As it's already been noted by other reviewers, there's no excuse for Queensryche fans for not having it already. This video shows the band in it's prime, and the performance is outstanding. Get it now.
B000002B7O|5.0|Diary Of A Madman was the second solo album Ozzy released. Although Ozzy's sound would not be perfected until a little while later, Diary Of A Madman stands as proof the Ozzy truly is the Godfather Of Metal. It kicks off with the famous Over The Mountain. Then comes the equally famous Flying High Again. Those two songs, I feel, are a little overrated. But the stuff the comes afterward is the cream of the crop. Like You Can't Kill Rock N Roll. That song pledges allegiance to heavy metal. Also Tonight is an odd and frustrated ballad the leaves me scratching my head every time I hear it. The album closes with the glorius title track, which begins in soft acoustic sounds and ends with brutal electric guitaring with a huge chorus going &quot;ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah&quot;. This would be the last album to feature the virtuoso guitar playing of Randy Rhoads, who was killed in a plane accident a year later.
0609610570|3.0|The primary value of this book is its emphasis on \\"management\\" as being the primary focus of successful business leaders. Far too many business books talk in flowery terms about strategy and enablement, and relegate the management function of execution to lower ranks than those occupied by their enlightened readers.<br />This book has its priorities right and for that reason can be recommended to those who wish to make a difference. A criticism might be that the advice given requires considerably less than the 278 pages devoted to it.<br />... and what is that advice?<br />Primarily, of course, it is to focus on accomplishing one's objectives rather than trumpeting them. Seemingly obvious but the fog of emotional involvement in difficult and fast-paced business situations can make even the most experienced and level-headed business leaders lose their bearings. And, of course, there's always hubris.<br />1. Know your business, internally and externally, in detail<br />2. Know your people intimately<br />3. Make your objectives clear, few, simple and realistic<br />4. Reward achievement of the explicit objectives and no others<br />5. Know yourself and subordinate your ego; eat your own cooking<br />6. Good people are everything
038533348X|4.0|Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle (I'm still trying to figure out why he chose that title instead of \\"Ice 9\\" which would have been more descriptive) is a very interesting book.  It opens up multiple avenues for discussion on all manner of topics both social and scientific and would be a fine choice for a discussion book or a book club book.<br />Unlike L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology, Vonnegut's Bokononism, created in this book, never caught on as an actual religion.  I would say Vonnegut's religion has much more potential among Christians of weak faith than Scientology, so I'm not sure why it never caught on.  Perhaps because Vonnegut didn't set up his own church and start believing his own stories like Hubbard did.<br />Anyway, from the character sketches to the fleshing out of fictional locations, sciences and religions, Vonnegut has a fine eye for detail.  He has created a world we recognize and he wields the power to destroy it well.
B00005JLR8|3.0|In America is about an Irish family illegally entering the U.S. after their son has died from cancer.  The story follows their transition to life in New York City: getting jobs, going to school, and coping with the son's death.  There are a lot of enjoyable and touching scenes of life in a poor neighborhood, but it also dragged on at many points in between.  The acting is generally good, but the most interesting characters are the two daughters.  The parents were in a more supporting role and I found little to like about them.  In my opinion, you not only must be in the right mood to enjoy such a slow paced movie about the mundane, but the story must also connect with the audience and for me it did not work.  In contrast, I did enjoy Lost in Translation, which is another film about ordinary life, because I liked the characters and could relate to the story.  While I do not regret watching this movie, I found myself fast forwarding through much of the second half of it.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I have always hated jazz. I much prefer classical music as well at the real rocknroll...I believe that rocknroll died the day Elvis went into the army.

1577311523|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It is basically a &quot;how to&quot; on living in the present moment, a practice which most of the world's religions would approve of.<br />I am not a student of either Hinduism or Bhuddism (although I do plan to read the Bhagvad Ghita this year) but I think that Tolle has been deeply affected by both approaches.  But he also has been influenced by A COURSE IN MIRACLES and by Christianity.  I feel that the strength of his work is that he has drawn some principles on which most of these religions would agree.  Although I'm not sure I see eye to eye with his overall view of God, there is a lot of good, practical wisdom on how to live in the now.<br />One of the frustrations of my childhood was that I was always told to &quot;trust&quot; and to &quot;believe&quot; but was never told HOW to do it.  Perhaps everyone needs to learn it for themselves -- but I found the ideas put forth by Eckhart Tolle to be very helpful.  And as a natural born worry wart, I've found that his book gave a lot of helpful ideas.<br />He cautions us not to put our identity in our minds -- thus trying to make the mind do for us what it was never intended to do.  He encourages to be &quot;silent watchers&quot; of the our thoughts and behavior, and to stop investing the mind with &quot;selfness.&quot;  He also encourages us to connect with our &quot;inner body&quot; and to use the body as another way to connect to the &quot;now.&quot;<br />This of course just scratches the surface of what Tolle teaches.  It is a valuable work that will help you improve your relationship to yourself and to others.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Well up to today I still can't decided if this CD is better than her last one. What I can tell you is that it's a lot different. It's a lot heavier and songs have more deeper meanings than her previous album. In my opinion she changed her style a little bit, most of her tracks adopted the style of Punk/Rock, not like in her old album that she had more Pop songs than Punk songs. You will defenetly love this album, buy it!
0671027387|3.0|With the popularity of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code, I'm sure that alot of readers like me are looking for other works by this popular author.  Deception Point is one of his earlier works and features the fast pace, non stop action that he is becoming known for.<br />  In Deception Point, intelligence agent Rachel Sexon is the daughter of presidential candidate Senator Sexton.  He opposes big government spending and one of the features of his campaign is to stop waste spending, esp NASA.  The sitting president summons Rachel to verify an extraordinary find in the Artic Sea--a metorite with proof of extra-terrestial life form..found by NASA.<br />  Rachel and other civilian experts soon find out that the meteorite is a hoax. This discovery puts their lives in danger as an elite military team targets them to destroy them and proof of the deception.  TV scientist Michael Talland joins Rachel to help find out the truth.  But they are unsure of who to trust in the government and who is behind the conspiracy.<br />  The plot of fast paced and exciting with lots of action and suspenseful twists.  It keeps the reader engaged in the story.  As with all his other novels, there is a lack of character development that limits this novel and prevents it from giving it 5 stars.  But for fans of a fast moving thriller- this book won't disappoint.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|First I should mention that I love Dream Theater, they are one of my favorite bands, and up till now, I've loved practically everything they've done (except for &quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot;, which had good music, but kinda lame vocals), but this album has just disappointed me in ways I can hardly believe.  The whole album is just so cold and mechanical, filled with useless instrumentation that doesn't really serve any purpose other than to be distracting.  Even when they try to sound emotional and melodic, like on &quot;Vacant&quot; and &quot;Endless Sacrifice&quot;, it still sounds completely soulless.  This album sounds like robots programmed to play like Dream Theater, but without the creativity.<br />However, there is one song here that almost saves it.  &quot;Stream of Consciousness&quot; is a pretty good instrumental, with much more focus than the rest of the album.  It doesn't really make the album worth buying, but it definitely stands out among the rest.<br />I'm sorry, but this is just bad.  Get any DT album over this, they're all about 1000 times better (even WDADU).  If this is what they're going to sound like from now on, then Mike really needs to leave and make OSI his fulltime band.  That album blew this out of the water.
B000001FYL|5.0|This first-rate CD contains songs by Jon Bon Jovi that were inspired by the successful movie &quot;Young Guns II&quot;.  Each song on the disc has a distinct western style to it, and Jon's fine vocals are apparent on each track.  The CD contains such high-energy songs as &quot;BIlly Get Your Guns&quot; and &quot;Never Say Die&quot; as well as the ballads &quot;Miracle&quot;, &quot;Blood Money&quot;, and &quot;Bang a Drum&quot;.  This CD has a distinctly different sound from other Bon Jovi CDs.  Gone are the high-energy lead guitar solos.  These have been replaced by acoustic guitar pieces and a slower pace to each song.  I listen to this CD quite regularly and its one of my favorites in my collection.  Pick up this great CD and hear a different side of Jon Bon Jovi.
0060012218|5.0|Russell Middlebrook, a witty and remarkably frank high school sophomore is the narrator and protagonist of Brent Hartinger's, GEOGRAPHY CLUB. Russell's is a believably fresh and quirky voice, shining like a lighthouse beacon, in an ocean of gay coming out material. Quite possibly the most popular genre in \\"Gay Lit\\" today, the, \\"coming-of-age novel,\\" dominates the Queer shelves. Unfortunately these offerings tend to be overly romanticized and just plain sappy. GEOGRAPHY CLUB is anything but. No, this is a book with real teeth and a sharp bite. This novel has more than its fair share of reality checks, yet humor and hope are never sacrificed to the standard teenage cynicism of the stories tone.<br />Russell is gay and firmly embedded in the closet. He's not one of the popular kids, but he's not a social pariah either. Along with his friends Min and Gunnar, Russell manages to stay within the \\"borderland of respectability,\\" at Goodkind High School. Russell thinks he's the only gay person in school, so he only confesses his sexuality on the internet. One night he discovers another gay teen from his high school in a chat room and the two agree to meet. \\"GayTeen\\" turns out to be Kevin Land, a hunky jock and star of the baseball team. Russell is more than a little flabbergasted. After the initial shock wears off, the two boys agree to confide in one another about their mutual concerns. Russell, so excited he can barely contain himself, decides to risk all and tell his best friend Min about the rendezvous. Much to his surprise Min reveals her bisexual nature to him.<br />Before you know it, five gay teens (Min has a girlfriend and she's got a friend) are meeting for pizza and discovering that they are not alone, but how can they continue meeting without their secret being uncovered. They decide to form a school club so boring that no one will join, thus allowing them to meet on a twice weekly basis. The Geography Club is born. All goes swimmingly until a rumor about a gay teen sweeps the school, and the GC members start to get exceedingly nervous. Is the jig up for the closet club or will eyes be focused on Brian Bund, the schools number one outcast and overwhelming recipient of the worst kind of teasing teenagers are capable of?<br /><br />Through the voice of Russell, Hartinger provides his readers with an amazingly accurate picture of what gay high school life is like today. Russell talks directly to us as if we were right there with him, shooting the breeze in the school cafeteria. He is cocky, unsure, comical, frightened and sincere, all at the same time. We get excited with him when he talks about his budding romance with Kevin, and how he joins the baseball team to be near him, and we hurt for him when fate plays an awful joke and his life is temporarily shattered. This is a kid's world and we're told about it by a gay kid. Adults play next to no role here. The story is thought provoking and wonderfully entertaining, proving the incredible highs and lows of adolescence stay unchanged from generation to generation.<br />I can not end this review without returning once more to the character of Brian Bund. Everyone who ever attended an American high school remembers a Brian or two. Those horribly mistreated outsiders who bore their lot with quiet dignity. Hartinger obviously remembered as well. His respectful portrait of this incredibly noble individual stands amongst the finest in contemporary gay fiction. I am unquestionably impressed.en sweeps the school, and the GC members start to get exceedingly nervous.

B000006TRV|5.0|Pink Floyd is one of those \\"like 'em or hate 'em\\" bands.  Their music is very atmospheric, orchestral, and dark.  In other words, it ain't pop.  So if you prefer peppy little ditties about dancing and sex, or if you want Christian-rock lite, then stay away.  <br />That said, this is arguably the best Pink Floyd album.  Every song seems to be placed perfectly in order and the tracks flow wonderfully.  Even \\"Another Brick In The Wall (Part 2)\\", which is overplayed, sounds good.  \\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\" and \\"The Trial\\" pull emotions out of you.  <br />The guitar is amazing, the singing is powerful, and the lyrics are slightly disturbing.  The subject matter may not win any awards for originality (he hates his mother and war is bad, got it), but it is so much deeper than most other albums released then or now. The songs work much better with the video included (i.e. the movie), but it's still powerful.<br />This is not party music, house-cleaning music, or anything like that.  Opera is meant to be listened to and appreciated.  This is rock opera, and it should be given similar appreciation.  And unlike many drug-addled bands, this is not a jam band.    <br />If you like Pink Floyd, then you MUST buy this album.  If you don't know Pink Floyd, this is a great way to start.  If you hate Pink Floyd, then write one bad review and STOP.  We don't care if you live in Heaven's Realm, or Sweet Gardens, or whatever.  This isn't a message board - it's a review column.  State your opinion and move on!  Please!
B00005JA2B|5.0|This is about the best rock and roll can get.<BR>Steve Walsh vocals and Kerry Livgren lyrics cannot be beat!!<BR>When I look back on my college days, this was the highest quality music I listened to. <br />Concert at East Troy in the late 70s was flawless!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|okay everyone...lets all freak out together...slipknot got really good!  explain to me how thats a bad thing?  they took their talent, expanded on it, became more precise, and recorded an album that showcases the raw skill of every single member.  i dont understand how people can complain when a good band creates a great album and then gets even more popular.  dont you want them to succeed so they can make more music?  this album is not mainstream by any stretch of the imagination.  call stone sour sellouts if u want (i wouldnt...) but this is slipknot...raw...right to the point, and better than they have ever been.  this is a band at its best.  if you dont like it, then buy the new 3 Doors Down album and live in your happy sheltered little world...
B000268QB2|5.0|I wait and wait for the that magical indefinable sound that takes me to the heavens of Pop pleasure.  Travis teased, Coldplay directed me upward, and now Keane has guided me to the clouds.  No guitar needed for the sonic layerings that cascade around Tom Chaplins ethereal (yet not so lofty as to become pretentiously arty)voice. Think Freddie Mercury with less histrionics and a greater adherence to subtlety.  Each song has a lovely hook and sweet melody. At once familiar yet remarkably fresh.  If you love pure,unadorned, bitter-sweet pop do not hesitate to pick up a copy.  You will undoubtedly be pleased and regain any faith you may have lost in pop music.
0694003611|4.0|Somehow \\"Goodnight Moon\\" just keeps on trucking along.  It is the number one bedtime story parents have sought out for years and years and years.  It is colorful and sober.  Elegant and peachy keen.  The truth of the matter?  I was never too attached to \\"Goodnight Moon\\" as a child.  Raised on a diet of Steven Kellogg and Richard Scary I had a hard time adjusting to the low key murmurs and repetitive phrases of this most ancient of picture books.  Looking at it now I am bowled over by its original publication date.  1947.  Amazing.  Who would or could have thought that this little unprepossessing story would come to win the hearts and minds of as many millions of parents and children as it has?  And, more importantly, continues to do so.<br /><br />You all know the story but I'm going to sum it up for you anyway.  There is a bunny.  It is attempting to go to sleep as an unnamed old lady says hush.  The viewer is given the chance to look and and peruse the various objects around the room.  Everything from the two kittens on the rug to a brightly lit little toyhouse.  As we watch, the shadows lengthen and the room grows dimmer.  Time on the clock passes.  Finally, the restless little hare resigns itself to sleep and even the kittens cuddle together in the still quiet night.<br /><br />Brown has written the book with enough simple but easy-to-understand words for your average preschooler.  I have always felt that the point in the book where she cheats a little is when she writes, \\"Goodnight comb, and goodnight brush, goodnight nobody, goodnight mush\\".  Goodbye nobody? Surely something could have been drawn there instead of a blank page.  Nonetheless, it is not a boring book.  Sleepifying, yes.  Drowsy-making, yes.  But not dull.  As I've said, it is not my favorite children's picture book, but even I can see that it is well-constructed and well-written too.  With the derth of really effective bedtime books out there that have the ability to put you to sleep on purpose, a title like, \\"Goodnight Moon\\" stands out with its simple methodical goodnights.e like, \\"Goodnight Moon\\" stands out with its simple methodical goodnights.
B000000YG5|5.0|I bought this CD in steaming hot Singapore last summer and the Carribean melody to St. Thomas was like a cool breeze that made me forget about the heat! I knew that I was gonna love this album. All tracks here a great. There's no filler.<br />Rollins' tone is impeccable, big and warm and fat.<br />I like Miles and Coltrane because they can go very deep and bluesy in their approach, but I like people like Sonny Rollins and Horace Silver because they put the fun in the music. I can almost see them playing with a smile on their face.<br />My fave track is still St. Thomas... I know it's a simple tune, but it's an effective one. Even on wintery nights I get transported into Island moods when I put this CD on.<br />Definitely in my top 3 of all-time favourite jazz albums, which are at the moment:<br />1) Relaxing with the Miles Davis Quintet<BR>2) Saxophone Colossus<BR>3) Burrell Coltrane
B00005QXDD|4.0|Let's make this clear: although I like Jack Black, I do get tired of him playing the same damn character over and over.  That's why the comedy tracks on this album are funny but will get old.  <br />It's the sad fate of most, if not all, comedy albums.  Jokes get state once you've heard them enough.  When I first heard &quot;Drive-Thru&quot;, it was freakin' hilarious!  Now that I've heard it a bunch of time ... not so hilarious.  A chuckle, but that's it.<br />But don't let that stop you from buying this album.  The music is fantastic!  The songs manage to both mock and celebrate the folk-rock of the early 70's, and the production is high quality.  Vocals and guitars jump out at you and shake you around like a hug from a big uncle who's been drinking too much.  This is not a comedy album with a few chords strung together to provide a backdrop for a few gags.  The music is truly well written, played, and produced.<br />Just be careful: the songs do get a tad vulgar at times.  Okay, they're extremely offensive, but that's what makes them great.  If you're an uptight person who managed to ignore the two naked fat guys standing before a great horned Satan on the album's cover, then you're in for some trouble.  This is not for your mom's ears.
0151001634|5.0|Along with John Updikes's \\"Rabbit Run\\" this is one of the great novels I have ever read. Period. Through the eyes and heart of Charlie Gordon, we see the best and the worst of humanity, we see a person with little resources available to him struggle with enormous challenges. <br />Thanks to a scientific invention that leads to a startling new procedure, Charlie's IQ raises from about 70 to over 300.  It was interesting how getting smarter did not make Charlie any happier.  He was probably happier mopping floors at the bakery than when he was able to understand \\"higher echelons\\" of society.  The message of this book is that the goodness of the human heart can be pure regardless of educational level or intelligence.  <br />I found most interesting how Charlie attempted to understand his earlier life as he gained more reflective abilities and how he attempted to understand his family.  Also interesting...how he<BR>attempted to understand women.  As a lower functioning person, he barely grasped sexual politics if at all.  When he is forced to understand, he still doesn't because he sees the old Charlie in himself no matter how smart he gets.  He sees the old Charlie glaring at him in the mirror.  <br />Even as he starts losing his intelligence because of a procedure that was not perfect, he still has the great desire to retain as much as he can, and to keep reading books, a brilliant way to say through a novel, that learning leads to more learning in life and you can never completely get back to where you were before, but hopefully always moving forward. <br />This, for me, made me more sure of my unconditional positive regard for humanity, especially the potential for learning and love that we all have.  Charlie taught me a lot and I know he will teach you a lot too!(...)
B000069AUI|3.0|I prefer letting the hype die down before digging in to artsts like Coldplay. Finally picked this album up a solid two years after its release. It's a good listen. I like it. I give it 3-1/2 stars.<br />But there is so much hysteria in the reviews here on Amazon, so much hyperbole. Yes, these guys make a nice blend of emo and prog rock, but there's lots of good music out there. Enjoy it for what it is, a pretty darn good CD...but nothing more.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A TOP NOTCH SERIES. PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HAD A &quot;STAR TREK&quot; FOLLOWING IF FOX HAD STUCK WITH EM FOR ANOTHER SEASON. BUY THIS AND GIVE EM AS GIFTS TO YOUR FRIENDS. LOOK WHAT THEY DID TO &quot;FAMILY GUY&quot;. BECAUSE OF ALL THE DVD SALES, THEY ARE BRINGING IT BACK FOR ANOTHER SEASON. THE SAME COULD HAPPEN TO &quot;FIREFLY&quot;.<P>THIS BOX SET LEAVES ME WANTING MORE!!!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|When are seasons 2+ coming out?
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I think that Avril is extremely talented and this CD is excellent. I haven't heard a song from Avril that I haven't liked yet, and I think she'll keep it coming with the support of her huge fanbase. I think that half of the people who posted reviews on this CD are retarded seeing as how they can't type and/or type like four year olds, but as &quot;they&quot; say, that's just my opinion. Avril is a 19 year old who is ultra talented, and for all of you who wasted your time on typing retarded reviews on someone you didn't even like, I think you should stop criticizing Avril, eh?
B0001NBMBC|4.0|To go along with what other people have said, a lot of people might feel this is Slipknot's &quot;sell out&quot; album.  I couldnt disagree more.  I feel that a band broadening their musical and emotional range is fine.  If any of you have seen Donnie Darko, youll recall the one scene with the &quot;lifeline&quot; exercise where Donnie berates his teacher about how all things cannot be lumped into two emotions, in the movies case, these emotions were Fear and Love.  The same goes for music.  You cant stick to the same formula three albums in a row.  Iowa and the Self Titled were great albums, but I feel this shows a different side of Slipknot which people should open up to and appreciate rather than instantly write off.  <br />Key Tracks:  <BR>&quot;The Nameless&quot;- shows the full scope of Slipknot.  They slow it down but manage to come in with a brutal breakdown as well.<br />&quot;The Blister Exists&quot;-  Great Opener.  Some of the best drumwork Ive heard in awhile.<br />Before I Forget-  Crazy song.  Could have easily been on Iowa.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|There back! Even though they chaged there style sorta but i think its still f***ing awsome! Just cuz theyt sing a lil diff shouldnt m,ean u dont liek them. If you liek a BAND you liek them for there MUSIC! and this CD is GREAT i bought it right whenthe CD store open its an amzing cd i hate no songs its perfect thats why its 5 stars! Saw them live at the jagermaster show INSAIN S***!!!!!!!!! i say get the CD its really awsome and diff but its good!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|First off I would like to mention that I have followed slipknot since the beginning and I believe that this album is better than their second. I think that the band has matured into something original and creative. The only thing that is dissapointing is the acoustic tracks. Even though I like them I dont think that those songs fit with a band like slipknot. Otherwise they dont disappoint with their metal songs. Three Nil is like their best song period that beginning riff is hard core. Another thing which is cool about this album is that it was produced by Rick Rubin, who has been in the game awhile. I am a maggot for life all you haters can shut up.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I usually don't write a review after a couple of listens but I just had to after reading some others. I have followed Slipknot since I saw the bizarre CD cover in my local record store. I hadn't heard anything about them nor had my friends. They were unknown. To be honest I thought they might be an Insane Clown Posse retread. Sorry for the insult at the time Knot. When I listened to that disc I was blown away. Over the years saw them live many times, bought the DVD's, followed up with IOWA which was great but not classic. I just saw them recently live, very good but something was missing. The element that made them. Bizarre. They are mainstream now. They aren't dark or controversial. I was skeptic when members started having their own side projects. A recipe for disaster. I listened to this album twice in a row and it is very disappointing. This is not Slipknot. I know a band needs do the cliche thing and evolve which I read in a lot of these other reviews. Thats BS, give me Slipknot. Give me heavy metal music. Not three acoustic songs trying to display Coreys' vocal stylings which we all know by now he has. Evolving does not mean quieting your sound does it? If the music is too loud you know you're getting old. If this is their swan song which I am sure it is, what a crappy way to go out. Started to look like they were gonna be at the top of the metal game and now can be found under easy listening. The only tracks worth mentioning are &quot;The Blister Exists&quot;, &quot;Three Nil&quot;, &quot;Welcome&quot; and &quot;Before I Forget&quot;. 4 quality songs out of 14 is pretty sad. Goodbye Slipknot.

B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril's first album was the only CD in my car stereo for months when it first came out.  Although this one isn't as catchy immediately, I'm still happy to hear her voice.  And I love that Chantal Kreviazuk cowrote a few of the songs.
0385424736|4.0|Quite like a few of John Grisham's novels but feel this is by some way his best. Not sure quite why. Enjoy the first-person narrative, which is self-deprecating and funny. Also like the romance with the battered woman, the other characters in the legal practice, as well as the general atmosphere of Memphis. I think above all the characters are quite three-dimensional, which I don't always find with Grisham's books.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I just bought this cd today and i've been a hardcore maggot for a long time, and everyone who complains about losing &quot;their slipknot&quot; just doesn't know good music.

B00004Z400|5.0|This is a brilliant album, probably the best deftones album ever! the best songs r knife party, korea, passenger and digital bath and teenager is good too. i like all the songs but the worst song is elite because its a bit boring and tuneless. this album scores 9/10
B00020HEG6|5.0|I just can't believe how amazin job did John Williams, this new soundtrack from harry potter's series it's just unbelievable, it translate us to a magical world. no more to say but just that it's a great masterpiece.
0060512806|5.0|I was one of those people who only liked the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; science-fiction epics by the old masters of science-fiction books, but, after reading &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; and some other Neal Stephensen books, I have come to really like the sub-genre known as cyberpunk. I have purchased and am reading &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;Zodiac&quot;, as well as other cyberpunk books by other authors like &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Prey&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot; and &quot;Cyber Hunter&quot;. Kudos to Stephensen!
B00003CXXO|2.0|None of the reviews that I've read make a reference to another nuance in this film; the robots are treated the way our society treats others not deemed to be part of 'normal' society; the misfits, the gay people, the not so slim folks.  The pool side scene with the kids made me cringe; I could imagine kids hassling a gay companion that way.  Also: who in their right mind would allow a child to sit and watch the red necks pouring acid  on etc. and other wise mutilating robots?  I had to turn my face when the nanny was being murdered. Too much.  This is Spielberg?  I do not want to go see another one of his movies if this is characteristic of his work.  I for sure would check a movie of his out before I would allow a child to see one of his.
0062502182|5.0|I love this book and am saddened by the negative criticism I've read here. Some of these reviews are ridiculously cruel - and I'm not talking about being cruel regarding the story. Some people actually get off on criticizing and categorizing the kind of people who like the book.<br />If you do not believe in a creator, the soul, or have a mystical belief in what love can do to bring people together, The Alchemist may not be a book you would enjoy. Instead, you might find value in Stoic philosophers, such as Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, who offer great practical wisdom that borders on being spiritual without getting too mystical. Thing is, learn to value your life. Then show respect for others.<br />I want to personally thank the author. This is one of the great tales that are written into my heart, in the great tradition of writers who believe in the bounty of life and a source that connects us all.<br />We're all going to drop dead one day. In the mean time, Coelho inspires us to make the most of our aspirations. Why not? It's better than finding fault in other people's dreams. Habitually degrading other people is like killing yourself over and over and over. Read the book. If you can do better and write a book that sells a couple of million copies, go for it.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I bought this CD on a whim at Best Buy. I'm a big fan of the Old 97's (Too Far To Care is their best work, buy it), and figured Wilco was in the same alt country genre.<br />This is one of the best albums I've ever owned. It spent a straight month in my car CD player. I've never owned a Wilco or Uncle Tupelo record before, but this album is pure genius. The songs are so delicate, but not so noisy and artsy as too cease being great songs.<br />Dissonance on the songs is quickly followed by greatness. I never skip songs on this record, and I'm glad old fashioned studio albums are still made. No singles on this record, just great songs.<br />I've recently bought some earlier Wilco and Uncle Tulepo records. They're good, I enjoy them. But Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is brilliant. Buy it.
B0001CCXZW|2.0|I was waiting impatiently for this series to be released on DVD because I really love it. However, I was really disappointed when I received my copy. The quality is so bad that nobody would believe that it's an original copy!<br />WB is not being fair by producing this series in low quality DVD transfer because they've done a good job with &quot;Smallville&quot;. I hope they won't repeat the same mistake in the future.<br />As for this copy, I really hope that I could exchange it when they release it with better quality!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|i waited in great anticipation for this album (just like every other loyal slipknot fan), and it was well worth the wait! for those of u calling slipknot sellouts, u just don't understand that a band has to evolve!  slipknot did just that in Vol 3: The Subliminal Verses.  there's not a song on here i don't like. a lot of the songs sound softer, but slipknot really showed how artistic they can be when making music. it's not the same anger-filled albums like the last 2 cds (which were awesome i might add). they still maintained a sort of heaviness to the music, but it's a lot more melodic.  another thing, the guitar work is suberb! mick thomson and jim root really showcased their talent in this album.  another highlight is corey's vocal ability.  THIS GUY HAS ONE OF THE BEST VOICES OUT THERE!! he can sing real beautifully and all of a sudden explode into a visceral growl. he also writes some of the best lyrics you'll ever hear. only thing i miss is joey jordison's drumming. he doesn't play as psychotic as the previous 2 cds. but that still doesn't make this music any weaker than their other albums. overall i'm really satisfied with this cd! hopefully slipknot will hang around for a long time, because they are a force to be reckoned with!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|What can I say?  They sound different.  Is that a bad thing?  Of course not!  Slipknot sounds amazing in this album.  The introduction of melodic themes is very good.  It takes a couple of listens to get used to, but most of the songs on here are really good.  Standouts for me were: The Blister Exists, Duality, Circle (the New Slipknot if you will), Welcome, Vermillion, Pulse of the Maggots, Before I forget, and Vermillion Pt 2.  Wow, that's more than half of the album isn't it?  The masked men from Iowa have really worked themselves a good solid album.  4 1/2 stars.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Well I liked it, it was amusing. It wasn't brilliant, nor indicitive or a morally defunct society, one thing I could notice, but it was good It made fun of older japanese anime, the sword fights were not perfect, but interesting. I laughed alot, the soundtrack was well done (having Wutang's producer do it was a good call) I liked it, but to the rest of you, saying this movie is THE GREATEST THING OF ALL TIME, or...THE WORST THING OF ALL TIME....get over yourselves, yeesh.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Wow, this is the best album i've ever ever ever heard.  Avril's voice is so sexy, she definately knows how to get r' dun...I love Dont Tell Me, it is so deeeeeep...The rest of the songs are great too , they are so full of deeeeeepness and she knows exactly what shes talking about ... i sure as hell dont !!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|first of all, this album was nothing i expected it to be.  i expected it to be good...not differant.  granted, you still have corey's screams and the pounding drums and guitar.  but along with that there's a lot more melody.  more emotion. many people are going to say that this album sucks, because it's not like the selftitled album or iowa. but that's what the guys expect.  not to be welcomed with open arms.  before you completely shoot down this album, check out vermilion parts 1 and 2, duality, before i forget, and the virus of life.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|This album sounds NOTHING like the first three (I'm including Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. in there). To me, it actually sounds more like Stone Sour, with Corey singing more and more as time passes by. Sure, there's some screaming and stuff, but it doesn't sound as good as the other albums. Also, there's FAR less going on in the background during the songs, which kind of gives the album a cleaner feel to it, but it makes me wonder what the other 5 or 6 guys of the group are doing. Their first single \\"Duality\\" is set to be released soon, and it gives a pretty good taste of what to expect from the rest of the album.(...) <br />Like I said before, I think many fans will be a little disappointed, since it's not the kind of sound that they're used to. Personally, I think it's ok, but I have a feeling that it's not going to leave any lasting impressions on anyone's minds (including mine). Should you buy it? It all depends on what you like. Watch the video, then decide on whether you like it or not. To me, however, the band lost its edge and the sound that was pretty well defined, and now they're beginning to sound more and more generic and plain. <br />Again, it all depends on your taste, but I'd rather listen to something that has more substance and variety. If you want some bands that are harder (and better) check out Children of Bodom, Opeth, Bloodbath (same singer as Opeth), and Iced Earth.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Ahhh....The time has finaly arrived, only to have all my expectations SQUASHED!!!! Why must great bands always try to re-invent themselves. I mean, don't they at least try to learn from other bands mistakes.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Don't let the title of my review fool you.  I just got home from work and I stopped by my local Coconuts to pick up this album.  I've only heard the first couple of tracks so far and I think it's great.  Compared to the first two albums, I think this one kicks a$$.  The title of my review refers to all the negative reviews I've heard from so-called &quot;hardcore maggots&quot;.  <br />This is not the Slipknot you're used to.  Don't get me wrong, it's still there but on this new album, the band has evolved and it's definitely for the better.  The same thing happened with Metallica when they did the Black Album.  You can't expect them to just keep doing the same thing over and over again.  They won't want to do it anymore.<br />My advice... get this album immediately if you don't already have it.  It's worth your money.
B00005YJMX|5.0|For our second outing between Kinski and Herzog we find that the director has chosen to remake, or rather retell, his favorite film of all time - `Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens' by F.W. Murnau (1922), while at the same time adapting more of the original Stoker novel into the remake, using the original name of Count Dracula (Kinski) instead of Orlok and injecting his own take on the story of Dracula (in German), which for all intensive purposes is a story about `tragedy' and Herzog has correctly identified this main theme that would help levitate this entry to one of the all time great art-house horror films with images of Kinski's vampire often filling many film magazine pages and posters. In fact, it is Herzog's most commercial and accessible film to date. It was this telling of the Dracula story that influenced Coppola to remake the Stoker novel entirely into a film. It was not the first time Coppola had been influenced by Herzog. Coppola learned from Kinski and Herzog in \\"Aguirre: Wraith of God\\" that guerilla film making while going up a jungle river would be just what he needed for his version of Conrad's \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" (Apocalypse Now).<br />The usual Kinski/Herzog display of frustration is more subtle in this film than all the others probably because the beautiful Isabelle Adjani keeps Kinski distracted long enough for him not get angry with Herzog's cruel daily shoots to `get it right' and deliberately making the actors and actresses angry for their performances. Here everyone just looks deathly sick and move extremely slowly. Even Adjani looks paler than Kinski at times. For some reason this has given Herzog a more controlled approach to this film with certainly less improvisation and `on the spot' acting than any of his other collaborations with Kinski. Here we see a mix of Herzog's favorite - Tarkovsky's slow shooting style while cutting in shots of water (Herzog uses a bat in slow motion) and some sort of strange cinematic art house presence that we would see in many of Andy Warhol's productions. Herzog also gets the lighting just right and the cinematography is sublime - watching Kinski materialize from the darkness is again some of the most memorable images in art house cinema ever. Herzog also brings coffins en masse for display. Black coffins play a major role in the design throughout the film. Later on during a plague thousands of rats covering a city become central to Herzog's eye for capturing horror (a formal dinner takes place among hundreds of rats because the diners have the plague and wish to make the best of it before they die) - again extremely visionary and talented. Adjani puts on an amazing performance while remaining stunning under all the white. In one classic scene where she is confronted by Kinski she looks and acts more scary than Kinski almost performing him off the screen. The ending is an erotic take on the original film with Kinski touching Adjani all over, but the acting is excellent. The final twist comes as a shocker and is a bit funny. The end scene is like something out of a great Western and looks spectacular. Also the strange atmosphere of holiness is found throughout this film more than in any other Herzog/Kinski collaboration. The use of Orchestral sounds makes it all the more eerie while at the same time retaining that spirited electric connection to the presentation of madness that Herzog and Kinski are so well noted for.<br />'Nosferatu the Vampyre' is probably one of the most original art house horror films ever made even though the subject matter has been beaten to death, however it still ranks up there as one of the best versions of Dracula you can see. The DVD transfer is good and crisp. The aspect ratio is 1.85:1 and there are a lot of extras including director's commentary. By the way you can get the Kinski/Herzog box set of 6 films for a few quid extra than this stand alone DVD. Go look for it.e that we would see in many of Andy Warhol's productions.

B0001DI0FI|5.0|My friends and I have already watched this film several times.  Great actors, great story, and another brilliant job of directing from Weir.<br />This movie made me feel like I had gone back in time to 1805.  Amazing realism and characterization.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I bought the self titled debut because i was intregued by the image they portrayed, come to find out they were actually a kickass, inventive band with some true meaning and emotion they were trying to get accross to their face. This is definately the mainstream's influence on slipknot, and i am very disappointed..We need one more album from the roots!
B000059R8Y|3.0|I've decided to re-review this album... I submitted a review a while back but I really feel it necessary to do it again in a more objective way..<br /><br />Reptile came out at a time in Claptons life where he was very content and happy... Because of this, the material on \\"Reptile\\" comes off exactly as that..  Content, happy... BUT, the downside to that is content and happy can also sound bland and uninspiring.. This cd definitely straddles the fence in that direction..<br /><br />Filled with half cover tunes and half originals, the songs themselves are very laid back and diverse in their own ways.  The tracks where the album really shines is on the original tunes that clapton himself penned or co-penned with Simon Climie, his long-time producer. His originals are largely acoustic-based and very mellow, but it's always been Clapton's delivery either vocally or musically that makes me as a clapton fan associate with him.<br /><br />The rest of the album is filled with random cover selections that come off rather uninspired.. Most all the tracks could be considered under an \\"Adult Contemporary\\" label (for the exception of Superman Inside which is a slight attempt at reliving his 'forever man' days), but the one thing that glues them all together is the underlying 'blues' influence in each track.. there are folky songs, bluesy, soulful, country-esque, pop, jazzy, and even somba instrumentals... but one thing for sure amidst all this diversity is that you are constantly waiting for something to grab you.. it just never quite does no matter how hard you try..<br /><br />Put them all together, and you get an album that sounds more like a hodge podge of an artist who is obviously enjoying his life, but an artist almost as if he's no longer inspired with that fire for music, just doing something because he simply enjoys it.<br /><br />I'm in no way saying this album is horrible, or that it's bad by any standard..  I'm simply saying it's a colletion of extremely laid back tracks by an artist who is enjoying his days, which can either be very inspiring or very boring depending on your mood as a listener..ys, which can either be very inspiring or very boring depending on your mood as a listener..
B0001NBMBC|3.0|This just simply sounds like a heavier version of Stone Sour. Corey no longer does his original scream but now more of a raspy yell. The only reason why I gave it 3 stars is because the music. The music is still really good but corey just ruins every song for me. The only song I really like is track 13 the virus of life. It reminds me sort of Prosthetics on there first one. His lyrics dont even effect me on this one. On the first 2 they made me want to tear down the world but now he makes me want to..turn off the cd. I onyl reccomend this cd for fans of stone sour or people who are just getting into slipknot and this is the first album they heard.
B000127LW2|4.0|I think Voyager ultimately became the best of the new Star Trek series.  Next Generation is a close second, but Voyager was more mature.  One of the best captains, and not an easy role to fill.  And the last episodes of the series (season seven) is probably the best of the Star Trek movies.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I was a little skeptical getting the CD even when I heard &quot;All Falls Down&quot;, and loved it... but I'm glad I did.  Kanye has an inane ability to rap on various issues, and it shows just how versatile he is.  It's extremely refreshing to hear someone rap about other things than women, money, and cars.
0790749815|5.0|Like most people that saw this movie in 1959, I loved and saw it several times over the years , placing it in my top 20. I saw it several years ago on VHS and thought, maybe this movie really wasn`t the blockbuster I thought it to be. BUT THEN, I saw it on the new DVD version and the beautiful scenes were back and the splendid background music by Bernard Herrmann that Hitchcock used so perfectly in many of his best films was back in abundance. There are many films that are pretty much the same in VHS or DVD but North by Northwest is the winner by far in the DVD version.
B000089RVR|4.0|This album, together with the first one, can definitely cut you both ways.  Listen to it with your loved one in a romantic evening with candlelights and it will remain in your fond memories forever as one of the best nights ever.   Listen to it when you are alone with a bottle of wine next to you, and you will end up in the most depressing night ever.  That' all I should say.
B00012FXB8|4.0|Peter Fincher is a great director.  And while they had their problems with this movie, I think he saved their butts with a well crafted film.
0156012197|5.0|I thought this was an extraordinary book. It taught me so many things about growing up and all about life. Some people found it hard to understand because of the metaphors, but i think it's just a matter of whether you want to take the time to understand it or not.<BR>When i started reading \\"The Little Prince,\\" i thought it would just be another boring book that was assigned to us, just to waste our time. This was so much more than just a book i was forced to read, it was one of the very few that i enjoyed reading. From talking flowers to laughing stars, this book kept me interested.<BR>I followed the boy through the journey of his life from the unhappy parts such as the baobabs, to the happy touching moment such as the laughing stars. This is a truly touching book and i plan on reading it again some time in the future.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I just bought this cd this morning. And I was like the other guy that didnt see a Parental Advisory sticker so i thought oh god this is gonna be edited and just like he said, he hit the nail on the head the slipknot ive known to come and love has gone soft on me. Uhhhhh that is NO WAY the case by any means, there isnt a song on this album i dont Like. If your a real SlipKnot Fan Ignore all the stupid people saying they sold out and go get this I can guarentee you this, if you get this album you will no way shape or form regret it. Its Hard its heavy and its the SlipKnot I think all of us LOVE and have LOVED....<br />So do yourself the favor and stop reading my review, GO GET IT!!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I read all these reviews on this cd not worth buying, but i think the cd kicks ass. U just need to listen to it more than once. The people who dont like it must not like slipknot cause i think the guitar riffs and just as heavy as the other albums. So i would defanently buy this cd.
0312995423|1.0|You got some characters, you got some plot threads, but every thread is slow, dull and predictable.  This is just not clever writing.  Futhermore, the author clearly doesn't know anything technical, not about computers, not about cryptography.  It shows ultimately, when a writer is just manipulating words as meaningless symbols.
B00000FC5H|5.0|I am in the sixth grade and I LOVE this CD!  (In fact, I'm listening to it as I write this!) For school, we had to bring in CDs that people don't listen to now (2004) and I brought in this CD.  EVERYONE in the class loved it, including myself and my teacher, who remembered it, and loved it, both when she was a kid and now!  She was even singing along to \\"Let's Groove\\"! :)  Kids asked me what the songs were called, who sings them, etc. and we all love it!  It's great music to sing along to and dance to and, as one kid in my class put it, \\"You can just picture all these guys with afros in bell-bottoms singing it into the microphones! :)\\"  Lately, instead of popping in Black Eyed Peas or Now 15 (which are both great modern-day music CDs...thumbs up to them, too!) in my portable CD player, boom box, or parents' cars, I've been listening to Earth Wind & Fire!  I love disco music and, for me, disco never died and never will!  If you love disco, too, you HAVE to get this CD and listen to it!  Enjoy! :)<BR>P.S. I recommend \\"Shining Star\\", \\"September\\", \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\", \\"Fantasy\\", and \\"Let's Groove\\" as the Top 5 songs on the CD!
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I'll tell you, there are 14 tunes.....5 of which are keep able. This would have been a killer EP, but....here comes the mainstream and commercialism to kill metal once again. The downfall of most American \\"so called\\" metal. The only songs that are good are 2,3,8,9 and 12 (except for this out of nowhere &quot;picking tulips&quot; riff that appears in the chorus). There are SEVERAL songs on here that would make Stone Sour (who suck) look like HATE PLOW!! Yeah....I wanna see these guys in these outfits, with this type of an image come out on stage and pump out acoustic, fretless bass, string arrangements with soft pretty vocals.....WHAT A JOKE!!!!! It's nice that it will be that soft so they can hear me laughing at them! The thing that is so aggravating is that they could be great! The 5 songs I mentioned are AWESOME! as IOWA was. Great way to end the album too, with a solid....lame....boring.....mellow tune. My advice.....if you want to support Slipknot......download this album and re-buy IOWA!
B00004Y6NW|5.0|I first heard this recording in the summer of '78 - I was a guitar-playing college student in Boston and I had to find out how that Stratocaster sounded so good! No one knew who Dire Straits was, and I had to search the bins to find the LP (Sultans of Swing was still about 6 months away from becoming the monster hit it was to be). Friends and I loved the album, every track, and so when I noticed that Dire Straits was slated to play in a small local club I grabbed some tickets immediately ($4.50 each!).<br />The show was at the Paradise, seating about 130. The night of the show was memorable: SOS was number 1 on the charts, people were offering me $75 apiece for my tickets, and it was the second night the Mark Knopfler and Company had been in the U.S. in their lives. They came on stage looking excited and embarrassed, all wearing brand new jeans because &quot;they are so cheap here!&quot;<br />The show was just like the recording - upfront, close and personal. MK oozed a personable charisma and sounded like a million bucks, his red Strat modified with a large volume knob and a big piece of black electrical tape holding the pickup selector switch in the &quot;#2&quot; position. The band was tight, the arrangements spare and the songs riveting. It was clear to everyone there that night that these fellows were going places.<br />The CD is terrific, one of the great debuts and a guitarist's dream. Glad I didn't scalp those tickets...
B00005JLPK|5.0|If you liked &quot;Titus&quot;, be sure to see this film too.  A wonderful film about art, music, politics and love.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I am a very very unhappy customer of the movie studio which produced this DVD.   Its one of my favorite movies in the entire world and I bought it immediately when it was released many months ago.<br />Now Columbia Tristar wants more money out of my wallet and they release a second cut of the movie (ASIN#B0001WTUH6).   I cant believe this.  The same thing happened to me with the X-Men movies.  I am disappointed but its a great movie.
0060512806|5.0|Neal Stephenson tends to write for smart people, ergo, smart people tend to like his work.  He writes in their language, the stuff of computers and math and physics and hackers and conspiracies and all that madness.  My friends all like Neal Stephenson, because he writes about the things that they like and does it in a reasonably entertaining way.  Me, I just can't get into it to any great degree.  See, I've always found Stephenson to be somewhat overrated, with all the written praise about him treating him like he's the Second Coming of Something.  Now I don't think this is his fault, he's only guilty of writing books that people seem to like . . . but I think the hype around him blows him way out of proportion.  Critics salivate over his novels like nobody writes big books anymore and the publisher acts like he's a genius of singular talent (which, to be fair, is their job to do) . . . but I just don't get it.  Cryptonomicon is the latest example of my lukewarm reaction to his work.  It reads well, it's entertaining, but at the end of the day it just doesn't move me the way great literature should.  In some respects, it seems like Stephenson is trying to parallel the career of semi-obscure author Thomas Pynchon, his earliest successful novel Snow Crash was repeated compared to Vineland and I've seen more than one review saying that this is his answer to Gravity's Rainbow.  But other than the fact that both books are somewhat erudite, set in WWII and written in the present tense, there really is no comparison.  Stephenson's novel has a relatively small cast of characters and focuses mostly on cryptology, while Pynchon's novel had a extremely large cast, tossed in everything from mathematics to pop culture and managed to maintain a palpable sense of paranoia that leaked even into the narration itself.  So comparing the two is unfair and to Stephenson's credit, I don't think he himself has tried to link the two.  So we should look at his novel on its own merits.  How does it stand up?  The biggest credit here is that he manages to write a nine hundred page novel that moves at a fairly even clip, there's no boring parts to make you want to put it down, the chapters are mostly short, the POV switches often and he does everything he can to keep you engaged.  The plot shifts between the present day and WWII, in the former, computer guy Randy Waterhouse is trying to get the funding and backing to create an offshore data center, independent from all governments, while in WWII his grandfather joins a super-secret intelligence department designed not only to break Axis codes but to convince the Axis that the codes haven't been broken (the most clever part of the novel, in my opinion).  In both eras the Waterhouses are joined by the Shaftoes, who run around like lunatics trying to help various goals get accomplished.  In the end there's stuff about hidden gold and lots of information about cryptology and the math behind it, which is more or less interesting.  The problem is, with me at least, is that Stephenson continues to be more style than substance.  His prose is breezy enough, though the present tense style strikes me as somewhat pretentious and the tone for some reason comes across as rather smug, as if he knows he's being hip and modern and wants to make sure you realize it too.  Occassionally he comes out with a bizarre and memorable metaphor and some passages attain some resonance (though over nine hundred pages it had to happen, even if by accident), but the prose just exists to move the story along.  Even worse is when he stops the narration entirely to delve into math equations . . . it's clear that he thinks he's being deep and clever, but it really just comes across as annoying.  The plot is interesting enough, though certainly not gripping and I'm not sure why it took nine hundred pages . . . it's actually fairly straightforward, certainly not the difficult, knotted novel it's proported to be.  It meanders a heck of a lotthough, and although the diversions are entertaining, they don't really lead anywhere.  The characters are typical Stephenson constructs, for once not completely oh so painfully hip as in the past, Randy is actually interesting in spurts and the male Shaftoes are fun in a uninhibited fashion, but Amy Shaftoe really doesn't do much except act tough and act as the object of Randy's lust (there's no real strong female characters in the novel, which may or may not bother you), but for the most part the characters just serve to move the plot along.  So in the end what you have is a reasonably entertaining page turner, certainly nowhere near the bonafide literary classic that someone (either the author or the publisher) is hoping for, but it has its moments and to be honest it's the best Stephenson book I've read so far.  And hey, it's well researched at least.  Fans will have already read this, everyone else expect a fairly good time but don't expect to have your mind blown.though, and although the diversions are entertaining, they don't really lead anywhere.

B0001GL3K4|1.0|How could so many wonderful actors including some of my very favorites (i e., Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman and Colin Firth) be in such a sappy movie? (I guess it had to be for the money-I hope they made lots!) I purchased this movie on DVD simply because it featured actors that I hold in high regard, and with the expectation of a non-run-of-the-mill Hollywood-type holiday movie.  I WAS WRONG.  This has to be the most Hollywood-type, Hallmark made-for-Television move that I have ever seen (something I try to avoid, at all costs)-with even the ubiquitous black-gospel choir singing dippy love songs and Xmas carols.  While at the same time it is a movie about the most un-diverse group of dreary people that I have seen in a recent film for a very long time.  I had hoped for, at least, an ethnic couple of some sort or a gay couple of some kind.  Instead we are served up a bunch of very boring people having love problems including a cherubic grade school boy in love with another cherubic girl who OF COURSE leads the kiddies, in school, at Xmas time, in song with not one word of the song being intelligible.  Which brings me to another point-why did every featured seasonal musical number have to disintegrate into some pseudo rock, gospel type (come to the Lord) song?  Was it to appeal to the masses or to show that the people making this clunker were very very hip? Anyway buy this film if you are into sappy holiday movies and would love to see Hugh Grant dance (which is actually the best part of the film).
B00000JCOV|5.0|I'll admit, I used to hate this band just because they were popular. A lot of thier fans are little jackasses just trying to be hardcore and can't find any good metal besides what they hear on the radio, and I think the whole wearing masks thing is really dumb, but that's not what it's all about. The music rocks. It's really heavy guitars with pounding drums and a good frontman. This band is METAL. I don't care what anyone says. There are so many popular bands out there faking it but these guys are for real. When I'm in the mood to listen to metal music this more than gets the job done.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Simply put, I am very pleasantly surprised by this release from Slipknot. I believe another reviewer put it best when they said this was the album everyone thought they couldn't make. This album (for the most part) is a pretty strong departure from everything you thought you knew about these 9 masked men. <br />One of the nicest things about this album is that it feels as if Slipknot stripped there sound down. Gone are the silly lyrics (for the most part anyways), with the exception of &quot;Duality&quot; and &quot;Pulse Of The Maggots&quot; which are arguably the weakest tracks on the entire album. Older Slipknot fans will find comfort in these tracks, and &quot;The Virus Of Life&quot; as well, but will certainly need to embrace Slipknot's reinvented sound. Each instrument comes in much clearer and the production no longer feels jumbled or overdone. Hats off to Rick Rubin. Also, hats off to Mick for throwing some quick little lead licks and a few guitar solos in here. <br />Song-wise, this is the most varied album Slipknot has ever released. About half the album has a heavier feel to it (the blister exists, three nil, welcome, opium of the people), while the other half dips in and out of acoustic interludes (The Nameless), melodically driven rock songs (Before I Forget, Vermillion Pt. 1), full acoustic tracks (Vermillion Pt. 2), and what is probably the most impressive and haunting song on the entire album, &quot;Circle&quot; which includes an acoustic guitar and what I believe is a cello. Overall, such an experimentation from a band only known for being loud and heavy deserves atleast a nod of approval, whether you like the album or not. Highlight tracks include Circle, Welcome, and The Nameless. Very nice job here. Most people could probably find a new found respect for Slipknot with this album. A Worthy purchase.
0743454529|5.0|Makes you think, makes you cry.  But not in a bad way.  Loved the book, loved all the characters, great writing.  Other books like this:  Durable Goods, Show Me the Way, An Egg on Three Sticks, A Girl in Parts.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|The album isn't metal and it isn't Slipknot. Those people who liked the album are either fakes and posers or they're just brain-dead. If you're a fan of metal don't buy this album, BUT if you watch MTV and like NICKLEBACK then this C.D. is for you. I know there are  people who &quot;like&quot; this album but the fact is they are just in denial... Please seek help and pick up a REAL metal album...(SLAYER, God Forbid, Beyond the Embrace, Cannibal Corpse, Six Feet Under, The Haunted, Opeth, Otep, Shadows Fall, Killswitch Engage, Hatebreed...or any other good metal bands)
B0001HLVS2|4.0|&quot;Master And Commander&quot; is a masterpiece of a film.  It shows an accurate description of Napoleonic-era nautical warfare, as well as the bonds shared between a group of men on the sea.  Russell Crowe plays Captain &quot;Lucky&quot; Jack Aubrey, leader of the HMS Surprise.  Paul Bettany plays the ship's doctor/Aubrey's confidant.  The entire cast does an outstanding job.<br />The story begins with an attack on the Surprise by the Acheron, a French warship that Aubrey is hunting.  The rest of the film plays out with Aubrey setting out on a quest to outwit and defeat the Acheron, a ship that is armed with more guns, more men, and a captain that even Aubrey is respectful of.  Along the way, we see Aubrey's softer side, his human side, that usually isn't portrayed in a character of his magnitude and position.  We are shown the bonds of brotherhood that keep the crew together through good times and bad.  We also see how life on a warship can swiftly change from boredom to life-and-death situations, as well as discipline carried out by ranking officials.<br />Overall, I've yet to see a film that reveals so much action, so many emotions, and so much reality into two-and-a-half hour production.  Highly recommended.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|When I went to buy the album I first noticed no parental advisory sticker on the cd, which immediately lowered my expectations of the cd. Not because cussing is &quot;cool&quot; but the classic slipknot phrases I have come to love (i.e. &quot;I want to slit your throat and F**k the wound) would not be present. I had done a decent amount of reading on the new album, when I read they were experimenting with new styles I figured that meant a Stone Sour sound with more double bass clicks (I f**king hate stone sour!) I put in the cd, which I expected to suck, and couldn't believe what I heard. Guitar solos, slipknot sounding Corey (not Stone Sour Corey) new guitar sounds, amazing Joey Jordison speed and style, and more fast paces mini-solos. I think this rivals the other two Slipknot releases and has reinstalled my faith in slipknot as a band. Awesome awesome cd!
0805062971|5.0|Hard to say what I loved most about this brilliant book:  the sharp, stylish writing; the clever, made-up subculture of disaffected white males; or the overwhelming feeling of angry malaise, which is so common in this country today.  (Chuck Palahniuk trivia:  Chuck was a student of Tom Spanbauer, the well-known Portland (Oregon) writer and teacher.  You might want to check out books by other Spanbauer students:  Jennifer Lauck, Joanna Rose, Rodger Larson, Jackie Moyer Fischer, and Kathleen Tyau.)
B0001NBMBC|5.0|First of all; I already know people will be screaming &quot;SELL OUTS!&quot;, but the fact of the matter is this album is truly amazing. All the critics just said that these guys were just people who jumped around on stage screaming useless stuff with no meaning. They have two acoustic songs, one slowish type song and a song that starts off heavy and enters into an acoustic breakdown. Those songs are so creative and crazy, you have no idea.<br />This album is by far their most mature and in my opinion their best album to date and is a CD that fits everyone one way or another. Corey Taylor's lyrics are really good, but the only downfall is Joey doesn't get to show his skills as much, but we already know he's a bad ass drummer, so it's fine.<br />I honestly couldn't see them playing this album live, or else they would get booed off stage, because people are close minded like that. When I went to see Slipknot, they only performed four songs (&quot;Duality&quot;, &quot;The Blister Exists&quot;, &quot;Pulse of the Maggots&quot;, and &quot;Three Nil&quot;) and they were all heavyish. They wouldn't be able to play &quot;Vermillion&quot;, &quot;Vermillion Pt 2.&quot;, &quot;Circle&quot;, &quot;Danger - Keep Away&quot; or &quot;The Nameless&quot;, which all have a nice little soft side to them. My favorite &quot;soft song&quot; is &quot;Vermillion Pt 2.&quot;<br />Now as for the heavy part of the album, pretty much the whole first half of the CD is really heavy. I love &quot;Welcome&quot; the most, just because it's so intense. &quot;The Blister Exists&quot; was really well done too, with the patriotic drum rolls during the middle and at the end. Very catchy stuff.<br />Overall, it's my favorite album right now and would definitely reccomend this to people with an open mind.
1400032717|5.0|I find this book similar in style to &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;.  The narrator in that story had a different viewpoint than most people due to his changing intelligence.  The author here presents his story from the viewpoint of an autistic child.  Being extremely literal, he cannot completely understand the world.  But as one reviewer put it, the author lets you understand what is going on even though the narrator cannot.  I loved reading this.  And it was fairly short too.  It is nice to see an author get his story across without a lot of bloated subplots and wordplay.  Too often a writer refuses to cut the story down the essential and thus diffuses the impact.  Not here.  I highly recommend this book.
0792841344|5.0|If good films are like waking dreams, then good horror films are like waking nightmares.  Few can match the power of Phantasm in this regard. Masquerading as a B-shocker, it gradually develops a kind psychological depth shared only by the best in the genre - films like The Exorcist and Silence of the Lambs.<br />To begin with, the story is frankly outrageous: after the death of a close friend, two brothers (Mike and Jody, played by Michael Baldwin and Bill Thornbury) discover some strange things about the Morningside Funeral Home where their friend - and their parents, who died two years earlier - are interred. It seems the dour funeral director (a character known only as The Tall Man, indelibly rendered by Angus Scrimm) is not quite human.  He's able to lift fully occupied coffins by himself, as the younger Mike secretly observes; he bleeds yellow blood; he has a strange reaction to cold; and he is aided by small silver spheres that roam the halls of the mausoleum, doing unspeakably gruesome things to intruders. It seems his main activity, though, involves a novel use of the corpses of the dearly departed - a use we learn in the striking left-turn the film takes in the third act.<br />Somehow, what could have been a very silly film takes on an unnerving, Lynchian kind of surreality, thanks in large measure to a well-developed subtext about abandonment, isolation, despair, and guilt.  These are the anxieties that drive nightmares, and - despite the frequent humor throughout - writer/director Don Coscerelli infuses the proceedings with a poignant sense of sadness and dread.  Like Herzog's Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht, or Lynch's Mulholland Drive, Phantasm isn't just a scary film; it has the authentic texture of a dark, disturbing dream.<br />And this, in a film where a major sequence involves a large, obviously rubber insect flown around on a fishing line! It could have been a real Ed Wood moment, but instead, we buy into it somehow. Amazing.<br /><br />In The Tall Man, Angus Scrimm has created a classic horror film villain, in the Frankenstein's monster/Dracula/Wolfman/Mummy sense, rather in than the Freddy/Jason tradition.  There is no sense of irony in his conception or performance.  No camp.  No winking, wisecracking, or self-aware irony.  Just a powerful, implacable, evil presence.<br />Reggie Bannister rounds out the cast as a musician/ice cream vendor (!) who assists the brothers in their quest to rid the world (or at least their town) of the evil that has descended.<br />The performances (a couple of minor characters notwithstanding) are remarkably skilled, walking that fine line between believability and exaggeration virtually demanded by the genre.<br />The DVD is crisp and well produced.  There is a delightful introduction by The Tall Man himself, Angus Scrimm, to get things rolling.  There is a good deal of supplemental material to be found on the disc, and a thorough commentary track by Coscarelli, Scrimm, Baldwin, and Thornbury.<br />All told, an excellent addition to any horror fan's collection.an, Angus Scrimm has created a classic horror film villain, in the Frankenstein's monster/Dracula/Wolfman/Mummy sense, rather in than the Freddy/Jason tradition.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|I don't usually pick favorites, whether books, movies, TV shows, theater, artworks, etc.  But I think I can say this album is my favorite album.  Not perfect, but I have never seen (heard) perfection.  This is pretty close.  Every song is a keeper.  And the fact it is a double album seals the deal.  The Clash were moving away from the straitjacket of 70s punk and were now dabbling in rockabilly, punk, ska, etc.  This album blends it all in.  They could play a furious song and still craft an insanely catchy melody.  This album will bring you out of any funk you are in.  The slogan for the Clash was &quot;The only band that matters&quot;.  And for the two year period surrounding this album - it was true.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Heard this CD and couldn't believe my ears just like all the hype promised. This Renee Olstead is a wonder! I haven't enjoyed a voice this amazing in a long time.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Others pledge allegiance to Blonde On Blonde, but this is my favorite 60s Dylan (only Blood On the Tracks is better overall).  Not perfect, &quot;Queen Jane Approximately&quot; is fairly average compared to the rest.  But average on this album is great compared to most artists.  One thing about Dylan, he doesn't sound like the time he is in.  He doesn't sound like the Beatles, or the Stones, or the Byrds (even though their covers of Dylan are pretty good), or the Doors, and so on.  His music sounds like it could have been recorded in the 50s or the 90s.  Once you get past his singing voice, you will be hooked.  I was.  I had to buy this remastered SACD even though I own the original CD pressing (I don't have a record player and I'm not a vinyl fetishist).  MUCH better sound, even on a regular CD player.  A classic.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Apparently everyone is quite enamored with Norah Jones, as both of her albums are huge sellers - this must mean that she is a talent of monumental proportions, right?  Wrong.  That kind of thinking will only set you up for disappointment.<br />Critics have spilled so much ink and even find themselves at a loss for words when describing Jones, but the truth of the matter is that her music is just so painfully average and mundane.  They have you believing that Jones is the Second Coming, but hearing this album makes you wonder why - it's so lifeless, glossy, and dull that its only discernable purpose is as safe &quot;listen at work&quot; music, or perhaps background music at a soiree or something.<br />Jones's style supposedly draws from jazz, country, blues, etc., but there's none of the virtuosity and raw passion that we've comes to associate with these genres of music.  The end result is really just incredibly milquetoast and bland, and the fact that it's so inoffensive is the reason why radio and VH1 are playing it incessantly.  Did I mention that this music was bland?  These are the kind of songs that you forget five minutes after they were played.<br />Some have complemented Jones by saying that her phrasing and tone sound so familiar.  And that is because it's all been done before!  There's no question that she scores a zero in the originality department - Jones is kind of like Diana Krall, only even less daring.  We haven't even mentioned the cliche-ridden lyrics which drag this recording down even further - &quot;Come away with me and we'll kiss on a mountain top&quot;, &quot;I wished that I could fly away ... Catching teardrops in my hand&quot;, etc.  Certainly not the material we would expect from such a highly-touted artist.  So she won a few Grammy Awards - so what?  Nowadays the Grammies are nothing more than a popularity contest, with awards presented to the highest selling acts out there.<br />In summary: Come Away With Me is not the watermark that themedia has proclaimed it to be - it's an unspectacular collection of piano-based adult contemporary music.  Norah Jones has been coasting along on her good looks and having a highly accessible sound, but it's also a sound that's lacking in substance.  Maybe one of these days Jones will live up to the hype, but I would recommend that you pass on this album.
0800179501|4.0|This is one of the best teenage movies in 80s. It has lots of good elements, like romance, school problems, great music, fighting combats, and the zen of karate. This is a unique martial arts movie. Most of them focus on fighting combat scenes; however, Karate Kid instead focuses on the mental side: Wax On, Wax Off, Sand the floor, Paint the house, etc. Those are as a matter of fact the defensive techniques for learning blocking. You can see the director carefully sets up two traditional styles of karate: Hard and Soft. Obviously, the Cobra sensai &amp; his students are from hard style, very aggressive &amp; no mercy. In contrast, Miyagi &amp; Daniel are from soft style, focusing on defensive technique and mental training. They meet together finally in a tournament. <br />For this DVD, it lacks of some extra freebies. Only subtitles and theatrical trailer are included. No deleted scenes, no directory's commentaries, and no documentaries. I'm sure lots of people will appreciate if there's a DVD box set for the entire Karate Kid series with some good extra features.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Being a teen, I wasn't to psyched when my friends opened this game up to play.  But, My mind was soon changed. This is a highly addictive strategy game.  The cool thing is, theres no one strategy that will win it for you everytime.  You constantly have to adjust your strategy to what your opponets are doing.  Very fun, definite \\"Must Buy\\".
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album is simply amazaing!!! There's no other way to put it. Slipknot has never lost their touch. This cd is brutal yet melodic at the same time and is just pure brilliance!!! Coreys voice escalates from a slight yell to a bloody scream!! This is the kinda thing other bands need to do to be as great as the Knot. I've been a Maggot since early 1999 and I'd say this album is up there with 742617000027 (Self titled) and Iowa. I'm sure this wont be their last cd...This cd is also sic b/c you get a chance to win one of 9 jumpsuits worn on an Iowa tour and other very cool things that no other bands are generous enough to give their fans....This album is a 5 outta 5, 2 devil horns up, WAY UP!!!! A++++, What else can I say???? \m/ \m/
B0001UL7RY|5.0|i really like it. especially Don't Tell Me and My Happy Ending. its a good CD but it'll take me more time to get used to it than the first one.
B0000A1WGH|5.0|If you've not seen Good Bye Lenin! the score is still beautiful. The piano is very light and very touching, but then the score gets more complex with a woodwind quartet(?) and continues gaining complexity with the addition of strings to the quartet. It helps to know why the music is so sad in places, of course, you get a clue as to what's going on in the movie with track titles like \\"Mother will die.\\" <br />All in all, it's an amazing movie with an equally amazing filmscore.

B00005R1N3|4.0|Director:  Bob Clark<BR>Cast:  Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, Margot Kidder, John Saxon.<BR>Running Time:  98 minutes.<BR>Rated R for violence and profanity, yet by today's horror standards would more likely fall into the PG-13 category.<br />Seemingly a forgotten horror tale due to the over-publicized &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; and &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, the brilliance of &quot;Halloween&quot;, and the development of the summer blockbuster (&quot;Jaws&quot;), this thrill-a-minute chiller is just as original as any horror/slasher film ever made.<br />The basic premise of the film revolves around a sorority house/college dormatory that is mysteriously being tormented by an obscene phone caller.  At first, the girls think that the guy is just a prank caller and will eventually goes away, but dead bodies start to turn up.  Olivia Hussey stars as the main female squeeze, who suspects that the killer may be her boyfriend Dullea, who has been acting stranger and stranger throughout the events.  John Saxon is good as the police detective investigating the abnormal case, while Margot Kidder (who would later play Lois Lane in the 1978 action classic &quot;Superman&quot;) is excellent as the profane, alcohlic college girl who is stricken with asthma.<br />&quot;Black Christmas&quot; is shot brilliantly by director Bob Clark, using many elements of foreshadowing and using a fine musical score to add to the tension.  The first half of the film slightly drags, but the finale is superb as Hussey confronts the evil stalker.  A must-see for those who respect the horror genre and are fans of the &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; series.  Does not receive the praise or recognition it deserves; &quot;Black Christmas&quot; is a superb suspense piece.
B00006CXSS|4.0|I truly enjoyed this series.  I've watched it several times on the DVD and on HBO and now on the History Channel.  If you want to know what happened, this is the series to watch.
0783226837|5.0|Director:  Ron Underwood<BR>Cast:  Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Finn Carter, Michael Gross, Reba McEntire.<BR>Running Time:  95 minutes.<BR>Rated PG-13 for violence, language, and mild amounts of gooey monster gore.<br />A classic monster movie in line with the 1950's onslaught of similar films, &quot;Tremors&quot; is a devastatingly enjoyable film that will mark high on most viewer's richter scales.  Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward star as a quirky duo of garbage collectors for the small town of Perfection, Nevada.  Just as they are ready to leave town for good, start up a new business, and sail into the sunset as new men, their quiet little desert town is not all that it seems.  Seismologist Finn Carter discovers strange rumblings in the ground and suspects that their area is to be inflicted with a massive earthquake, but there is no past evidence of quake occurences.<br />The town of Perfection is soon put into a terrible frenzy as they are traumatized and gobbled up by flesh-eating, snake-like monsters that actually live underground.  They have no eyes, but can sense movements and sound--forcing all of the remaining citizens to read higher ground in order to survive.  Michael Gross (yes, that Michael Gross from &quot;Family Ties&quot;) and Reba McEtnire (yes, the famous country star) organize a military onslaught to protect and hold their neighborhood.  &quot;Tremors&quot; develops into a devilishly hilarious and campy monster movie with lovable characters, thrills and chills, and superb special effects.  Bacon is very good in the one of the lead roles, depicting his reckless character with charm and determination.<br />The screenplay created by S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock does not miss a beat, increasing in intensity and humor as the film goes on.  The firearm standoff between Gross/McEntire and the huge soil-slithering creatures is a a fun, ten-minute epic scene that is truly dazzling.  Rivals &quot;Aliens&quot; as the best monster movie of the latter part of the 1980's, &quot;Tremors&quot; might just be the most fun a horror cinematic experience can be.  Unheralded and somewhat forgotten; should be considered one of the best of its kind.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|OK, the new Slipknot is different. But at the same time, it's amazingly beautiful. The heavy, flesh tearing tones are there, they are just a little more structured now. I loved the first two albums (who didn't) but now they take what they did on the first two albums and structured it a little more. Slipknot doesn't have to be heavy to remain on the top of the metal heap, they just chose to be. And now because they want to try something a little different, people want to shun them and say they have changed for the worst. I still enjoy The Knot, and some of the better songs on the CD are &quot;Duality,&quot; &quot;Opium Of The People,&quot; and &quot;Three Nil.&quot; Some may consider the new Knot too close to being Stone Sour-esque on some of the songs, but that is just Corey stretching his vocals even further than before to try to silence critics who say Slipknot is nothing but screaming and growling. I give it five stars because the Knot is back, and better than ever in my opinion.
0783240236|3.0|Director:  Alfred Hitchcock<BR>Cast:  Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren, Jessica Tandy, Suzanne Pleshette, Veronica Cartwright, Ethel Griffies.<BR>Running Time:  120 minutes.<BR>Not Rated, but equivalent to a PG-13 for its violence, some gory scenes, and brief language.<br />Hitchcock's unforeseen success of &quot;Psycho&quot; put him in a tough spot--so many high expectations were placed on all of his films thereafter that it almost was not fair.  Many of his films were scrutinized due to the fact they weren't as explosive or haunting as his 1960 classic and &quot;The Birds&quot; is no exception.  While it portrays the story of avian, murderous birds terrorizing California with a horrific sense of dread and atmosphere, this film is a showcase for a cast of exceptional actors and actresses who do not even have a chance to show their stuff.<br />Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren are throw into an unusual relationship when the area is attacked by flesh-eating birds of prey (for no apparent reason mind you), setting the stage for a showdown of man versus flock.  The premise seems laughable, but Hitchcock uses his uncanny tools to create a film that possesses great cinematic urgency, using the birds as a sharp shock of terror.  With such attention placed on horrific scenes (such as the Tippi Hedren pay phone scene that has become a classic), the incredible ensemble cast does not have time to develop themselves as characters and vital chess pieces of the film.  &quot;The Birds&quot; is a well-respected thriller and for good reason, but it is no &quot;Psycho&quot; and it should not have been created in attempt to be one.
6305781427|5.0|From the very first moment that Yanni appears out of the floor the viewer is held transfixed in what is undoubtable the greatest concert ever given. This DVD has it all, dueling violins, a philharmonic director with attitude and of course Yanni's flowing majestic mane.<BR>Of course, as with any Yanni production, re-watching and listening is a must. The sights and sounds are so bold that it becomes very easy to miss the subtle nuances that make Yanni great. Look for Yanni's winks the ladies in the crowd, what women wouldn't swoon! Watch Yanni's hand movements as he conducts the entire show, all while headbanging away with the addictive beat.<BR>It isn't just Yanni that impresses, however. It would be a mistake to discount Yanni's bassist, either his playing or his permed locks. Which begs the question, who has better hair, Yanni or his bassist.<BR>The Violinist in red, apperantly the maverick of the group, does her best to upstage the festivities, but is ultimitly cowered by the symphony director, who is in turn shown who is the really in charge by the man himself; Yanni.<BR>I cannot urge you enough, buy this DVD, watch it over and over again; if you must slow motion the sequences, I know it can change  your life, but you must first let the music in.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Another masterpiece a the best damn band in the world. All those people that say that they sold out you all need to go to hell. This cd was put together with so much thought and care and you can tell. With every band going back to the drawing board now a days and saying they are going to expriment with their albums only a few have masterpieced it; CHIMAIRA and SLIPKNOT. Yea i was one of the maggots that was in shock when i heard that there was going to be a acoustic song on their album but when you hear it and you look at the lyrics they are true to life. Everybody feels like that one day and these two song vermilion and vermilion pt.2 bring it to life. To start off prelude 3.0 is a good way to start things off not to soft and not to heavy just perfect for a intro. The Blister exist what do i have to say it speaks for itself. love the snares very creative. Three Nil all i have to say is it kicked my ass at the jagermeister tour. Duality good way to say we are back. Opium of the people god mick kicks ass...classic slipknot. Circle ah the song before slipknot came on stage...when i heard it from the pit i thought what a good way to start the show...it prepares you for the pit experience of your life..good song. Welcome i dont need to say anything if you have not already heard it before the cd came out you are not a true maggot. Vermilion pt.1 good and creative like the musician ship on the song proves that even metal people can make a good slow dark mellow song. Pulse of the maggots i dont need to say anything you already heard it. Before i forget could be a single i like it. Vermilion pt.2 Alright good song but slipknot you better not release it as a single or play it live or ELSE. The Nameless damn good song i like the beauty in it i dont know about single worth but we will see. Virus of life very dark and mellow sounds like death metal compare it to scissors. Danger keep away good way to end the cd that is all i have to say. The acoustic songs sound like stone sourbut does not follow the same formula with the lyrics. Classic cd a masterpiece. Like Corey said Forget everything that you know. slipknot is reborn in 2004 and he is right.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|I admit to tremendous bias regarding Bob Dylan but this CD would be a deal if it were priced at 110 dollars.  No other work contains as much emotion and grand talent as this one.  I heartily recommend it and know you will enjoy for many years to come.  It's best at around it's tenth listen due to the complexity of the music.
B000002G87|5.0|This tour de force is unstoppable.  My favourite album of all time, this baby has everything that a blues guitar geek is looking for.  Packing two of the greatist guitarists to ever set foot on Earth, this album rules.  Eric Clapton and Duane Allman feeding off of each others energy with amazing solos and leads, it's truely magic.  Some of the most amazing bottleneck work EVER.  It can't even be argued that this is Clapton's best album ever.  The emotion in the album is so amazing.  The emotion felt in this album can never be matched by anyone else.
B0000024VP|4.0|Through my childhood, teen years, and most of my adulthood, I<BR>was under the impression that DONOVAN was pretty much about<BR>bubblegum music(sorry about that Mr.Leitch). Now, in my middle-<BR>age, of all places, I find that this talented musician is a <BR>master of psychedelica, right up there with SYD BARRETT, early<BR>PINK FLOYD, and other of my favorites. Heres to him. I wish I<BR>had discovered all this great music earlier in life. But not to<BR>worry, I'm making up for lost time, buying all I can get my<BR>hands on by this guy. I find that this release is a very good<BR>one, and for '66, well before it's time. There is not a bad<BR>song on this c.d. I did not give it a fifth star due to the lack<BR>of information on the packaging, and I think that in this day<BR>and age, they could have done more with the sound production quality.<BR>Thanks and keep on keepin' on,<BR>Tom
0399208534|5.0|This was a fantastic book.  I loved it in english and in German.  That is how a book should be.  I bet there isn't a kid who doesn't know who Eric Carle is he is that great of an author.  He has many great books.  I love each and every one of his books.  No dought in my mind
B00003CXCT|5.0|One of the best Sci-Fi films of the 20th century. The epic adventure of laser duels, loveable aliens and intergalactic romance.  While I don't know if they do an additional 6 video box set will or won't appear after star wars episode 3 comes out, the first three films will always been among George Lucus' best work and a welcome to any video / DVD owner  collection.
B00020HEG6|5.0|John Williams has crafted another musical masterpiece. I can hardly wait for the new Harry Potter movie now. <BR>Oooh, my appetite has been wet...
B000021YQV|5.0|This, if u enjoy rock and/or metal music should be the perfect album for you. System of a Down is a pretty kool group and they definetely sound like they know what they're doing in this album. Ill give a quick runthrough of the songs, 1 being worst, and 10 being best. of course this is all my opinion, and u may think otherwise, so dont take everything i say and believe me, cuz u may think otherwise. the only way to know is to go buy the cd! anyway here we go:<br />1. Prison Song 9/10 Good lyrics, good music. All-around just a good song, though its not perfect.<BR>2. Needles 9/10 Another good song that sings about &quot;tapeworms&quot; controlling Serj (vocals for SOAD) but the &quot;tapeworms&quot; actually referring to drugs and such. So good vocals, good guitars and drums.<BR>3. Deer Dance 8/10 this one's about how those with higher authority enjoy &quot;pushing little children with their fully automatics&quot; its an ok song, and has some good stuff in it.<BR>4. Jet Pilot 7/10 probly has the weirdest lyrics of any song on this cd, though its still an ok song, but kind of short.<BR>5. X 6/10 the drummer John does a really good job in this song in my view, but other than that its not a whole lot. same or similar lyrics repeated the whole song. <BR>6. Chop Suey! 10/10 probly the best song on the album. awesome guitars, drums, lyrics....EVERYTHING!<BR>7. Bounce 7/10 another song with weird lyrics cause it talks about a pogo stick and having some kind of pogo stick contest with his girlfriend and her friends. its also an ok song. nothing really bad music-wise. nothing all that good either.<BR>8. Forest 9/10 i think serj did a good job with lyrics in this song, and i like how it really starts to pick up speed in the end. all around kool song,<BR>9. ATWA 8/10 i think this song is supposed to be about life through the eyes of charles manson. anyway, its pretty good, lyric wise and sound wise. <BR>10. Sciene 9/10 a kool song with an armenian/arabish feel about how scienceis ruining our world. pretty interesting song.<BR>11. Shimmy 8/10 another shorter song. i cant really define a topic for it, but its ok.<BR>12. Toxicity 7/10 good guitars, but its just kinda slow to me throughout the song. and it seems to pick up pace but lose it as soon as u start to notice the change, but still an alright song.<BR>13. Psycho 6/10 another ok song about groupies on cocaine. its kinda long, but its not really all that good<BR>14. Aerials 10/10 an awesome song. it can somehow be slow and fast at the same time, though i cant explain it, but its got great lyrics and sound. <BR>15 Armenian Funeral Song 10/10 this is a funeral song that comes on after aerials ends. its a pretty kool song that reminds us where all of the SOAD members came from. Its an arabic song really, kind of a kool ending to this album<br />well thats all for this album. I guess that means, including the funeral song, it would score a 123/150 which is pretty good. anyway, thanks for reading this if u actually read all of it. Cya.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Lets face it people. 'Let Go' was pop, tinged with some faux-punk, that made Avril look like the biggest poser/loser/hypocrit in the world. However, 'Under My Skin' is a pure, all-out rocker. The music, lyrics and voice have improved tenfold.<br />The album starts off with &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, which has one of the catchiest riffs on the whole CD. After that, we're on &quot;Together&quot;, which, for me, is only an alright track. After that, we're on &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; probably the only song out there, right now, that teaches young girls to say no whenever guys only want a piece or whatever. &quot;He Wasn't&quot; reminds me a lot of 'Sk8er Boi' however, it's a pretty catchy song. &quot;How Does It Feel&quot; is an incredible track, the words, music and Avrils voice sound sooo real and so amazing. &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; is the next release from &quot;Under My Skin&quot; and is one of the catchist songs on the CD. Next, we have &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; which has hard hitting words, about a girls longing to return to her youth. &quot;Forgotten&quot; is an alright song, not bad but not amazing either. &quot;Who Knows&quot; is really the only positive song the CD, catchy, nice message. After, we have &quot;Fall To Pieces&quot; which is such a pretty song, I really like it. &quot;Freak Out&quot; has one of the best music on the whole CD, however, I didn't really like the lyrics. And finally the last song &quot;Slipped Away&quot; is worthy of a tear. It's such a sad, passionate, emotional song. An amazing way to close the CD.<br />Avril's voice and writing skills have greatly improved on this new CD. &quot;Under My Skin&quot; finally shows us what Avril was being made out to be when she first arrived on the scene. A rock chick who stands apart from the rest of the crowd in terms of image, attitude, music and voice. With this CD release, Avril is finally getting closer to making her own unique sound and style instead of being a mere puppet for big record execs.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|OMG! This CD is insane! Metal, mixed with acoustic, oh it's just amazing! My fav song on the CD is Circle, which shows off Coreys voice a lot! This CD is by far their best work. A little less heavy, but its lyrics make up for it! Get this CD ASAP! You won't regret it!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|The songs on Avril's second album may not be packed with all the catchy hooks that defined her first album, but they are much richer - especially from a lyrical standpoint.<br />The mood of the record feels like a natural extension of songs like &quot;Losing Grip&quot; and &quot;Unwanted&quot;. Under my Skin's first single &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; actually feels a little amateurish and out of place compared to the rest of the tunes.<br />Amazingly, not a single song on this sophomore effort is lacking. Given the quick turn around from the debut, I expected to find at least a few filler songs, but every one is worthy of the album.<br />&quot;My Happy Ending&quot; and &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot; are clear stand-outs that seem destined for excessive radio play. &quot;Forgotten&quot; may be the most creative of the bunch. &quot;He Wasn't&quot; with it's obvious Green Day influence, the naively optimistic &quot;Who Knows&quot;, and the heartfelt &quot;Slipped Away&quot; are also strong offerings.<br />With Under My Skin, Avril has proven she's more than a corporate invention. If she keeps it up, she'll be around for years to come.
B00005JMCW|4.0|This movie is really a nice comedy. I wanted to see it because I already knew the story(read it on Hiper Disney many years ago) and because I love Lindsay Lohan since The Parent Trap.<BR>The story is quite good and amusing: Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Anna (Lindsey Lohan) switch bodies and are trapped until they realize how difficult each other's life is.<BR>It makes us think that life ain´t easy and being someone different not always changes the difficulties.<br />It´s a well achieved picture with great performances by the ever so lovely and beautiful Lindsay Lohan and by the excellent Jamie Lee Curtis.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|vol. 3 easily ranks in the middle of slipknot and iowa. <br />slipknot (i.e. album #1) is an absolute classic. the songs were heavy, bizarre, and had an edge that was slipknot. iowa was horrible. it was a commercial, boring ol' metal album that any rag-tag metal group could have put together. each song sounded like the other, and slipknot lost that edge that was slipknot. <br />vol. 3 is somewhere in the middle. it has a slipknot feel to it, but is still very metal mainstream. listening to this, i don't think slipknot could ever get back to the level they had in #1. but this is satisfactory.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Can this b--ch please stop making music ? No-talent, retarded, overproduced, re-arranged voice, siliconed-up.<BR>Please don't buy this.
B0001Z36PK|5.0|Neil Hannon did a record a few years ago that was ambitious. It was a lot different from his previous albums. He looked different as well. There was a bad reaction to it that was unwarranted. Since then he has done a bunch of American tours and become quite popular here. Many of the songs on the new album were played to those audiences in the past two years. Songs like \\"My Imaginary Friend\\" and \\"The Happy Goth\\" made an impression on those people who were hearing the new songs for the first time. Now we have the final album. It is a bit of the old and a bit of the new. Hannon has brought in a lot of influences from movie soundtracks. The opening songs like \\"Absent Friends\\" and \\"Sticks &amp; Stones\\" sound like the opening music for a Western. The latter song also features Yann Tiersen who did the Amelie soundtrack. Much of this album deals with absence and being away. \\"Leaving Today\\" is about leaving home and hoping to return. \\"Come Home Billy Bird\\" does for plane trips what \\"National Express\\" does for trains. It features the vocals of Lauren Laverne of Kenicke. Hannon has brought back the orchestra in a big way. This is a filmic album full of surprises and great songs.
B000002HJA|5.0|This is a really cool album. As a matter of fact, it's probably one of the best stoner rock cd I own. This whole cd just flows, if you understand what I'm saying. It's just really cool and simple. Josh Homme really demonstrates his talent as a musician. His guitar riffs are just great.<BR>If you like this one, I would suggest checking out &quot;Sky Valley&quot; and Queens of the Stone Age as well.<BR>Favorite songs : &quot;One Inch Man&quot;, &quot;El Rodeo&quot;, and all the others dammit !!!
B0001RVTXO|5.0|There has been a lot of excitement surrounding The Pixies. They are the most influential band of the 1980s. Black Francis invented the slow verse and fast chorus that paved the way for Kurt Cobain and PJ Harvey. Radiohead owe everything to them. They just finished playing Coachella to a packed house. I am glad that I wasn't there because it was mayhem. This is the first great collection of the best of four perfect albums. The Pixies (1987-1992) was this generation's Ulysses. All the hits are here. Hopefully this leads back to the albums. The Pixies deserve to be heard in their entirety. They created album rock and never had a dull moment. Even some of their later projects were great. Kim Deal's voice is great. Black Francis is a great songwriter. The guitar parts are so original. This is a great band. Hopefully more albums are released in the future. There are a lot of live shows out there.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Linkin Park in a nutshell:<BR>uninteresting rhythms, simple melodies (if there are indeed melodies), predictable chord progressions, and generally boring slowly paced songs (no I'm not talking about tempo...the songs take forever to progress and the changes move at a snail's pace).  The drumming is clean, but this is because it's laughably simple, as is just about every aspect of every song.  <br />I do have to congratulate Mr. Hahn though.  While not exactly a musical instrument he's using, at least he shows some degree of creativity and skill.  <br />Every song is utterly depressing.  The band fails to realize that some people actually do have happy moments in life, believe it or not.  But that doesn't matter.  Linkin Park is writing for a teen audience that is trying state its rebelliousness and hatred of parents (and authority in general). Luckily for the band, this group has no idea how to judge if music is well written.  The only musical criteria they have is if it's angry and if it's popular.<br />I see how people might like it, however: it's easy to grasp and one needn't think much when listening to get the full effect of the music.  If you've heard it once, you've heard it enough. No replay value at all.  A disgrace to musicians everywhere.
B00020HEG6|5.0|The third installement of Harry Potter: Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban got a new spirit music, in one word is just beautiful. A little different from its predecessor: Sorcerer's Stone or Chamber of Secrets. Prisoner's music is more dark, it evokes very much than Sorcerer's stones and its more depth than Chamber of secrets. For the first time, in spite the faboulos Hedwig's theme, Harry Potter it's there, he's not just a wizard kid: he's an orphan, he's a boy with joy and pain and the music reflect that.<BR> John Williams did and amazing reivention of the spirit of Harry Potter music and added new themes. Tracks like &quot;Buckbeak's flight&quot;, &quot;a window to the past&quot; and &quot;finale&quot; are just beautiful. <BR>on the other hand we got the jazz style of &quot;the Knight bus&quot; or mediaval style in &quot;double trouble&quot; or &quot;Hagrid the professor&quot; and even a Waltz in &quot;aunt Marge's waltz&quot;.<BR> Beautiful score.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|It has been brought to our attention that the album released as: Vol.3(The Subliminal Verses) is in reality a recording of the new work from Stone Sour.<BR>-* Road Runner Records is deeply sorry for this Huge Mistake.*-
B00020HEL6|5.0|This girl has an outstanding voice...what an amazing album...You can listen to every song at [...]
B0001NBMBC|2.0|This cd is a disgrace to what used to be a hard-hitting group. With the track &quot;circle&quot;, which is acoustic just proves they have sold out. THis is not the time to experiment, just do what you've been doing from the past. I went to the concert and they want us to mosh to PULSE OF THE MAGGOTS. SOrry people, if you like this cd, you must have never heard anything before this truely DISASTERPIECE cd. Corey's vocals have lost their touch and so has Joey's drummming. THe worse experimental cd in metal.
B00003CXCT|5.0|At this point in time I have no idea what version of these classic films will be appearing in this DVD set. Most sources say it's the 1997 special editions, while rumours have persisted that the films have been further retooled to make them mesh better with the new prequel trilogy. One things for certain, it won't be the trilogy as seen from 1997-1995.<br />And you know what? At least for now, that's okay. I'm sure somewhere down the line, Lucas will release (or be forced to release) his movies in their original form. Given the demand for them, it's almost a sure thing FOX will put pressure on him to do so. In the meantime, we have these discs. While my opinion's only one among thousands of fans, I'm mostly fine with the Special Editions. The only thing that really needs to be removed is Greedo shooting first. Lucas can keep everything else, but Greedo needs to go. And if these movies have indeed been further altered, don't you want to see what's been changed? Even fans who hate the Special Editions like something nasty while probably buy this set either out of morbid curiosity or to complete their collection. You know you're curious about how Lucas has \\"further defiled\\" his movies, and you know you'll probably pay to see it.<br />Besides, the video and audio for these discs will probably be demo quality, and the bonus features look pretty sweet. They've put a lot of effort into this release, moreso than Lucas's other holy trilogy, Indiana Jones. Can we really pass this up?<br />Don't look at this set as buying the definitive version of the movie, but rather George's definitive version. Rest assured the classic versions will eventually be available. Star Wars fans know patience. It's a Jedi virtue, after all.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I have listened to Slipknot since the origional version of their self-titled cd was released (Had the song Purity on it) and I must say that this cd is as good if not better than the groups Roadrunner debut.  While some fans may state that the band has sold out I simply believe that this was the direction they were meant to go in.  I love every song on this album, even the acoustic songs, but they never lost any of their hard, frenzied feel.  Songs such as Duality, The Blister Exsists, and Nameless still have the origional Slipknot feel.  Pretty much anyone can appriciate the genious in this cd and I would suggest it to anyone that enjoys great rock music.
0790729377|5.0|Desire is a streetcar that brings Blanche DuBois (Vivien Leigh) to the French Quarters of New Orleans where her sister, Stella (Kim Hunter), lives with her husband, Stanley (Marlon Brando).  This is Blanche's last resort for help as she has faced numerous hardships such as loosing her parents, her job as a teacher, and an undisclosed secret.  These difficulties have left deep scares in Blanche's psyche and left her in a fragile state with neurosis and delusions.  Stanley is unwilling to let Blanche stay, but Stella convinces Stanley to let Blanche stay temporally.  However, Stanley's unwillingness to help grows to hostility and begins to affect Blanche as she discovers the true nature of Stanley.  Streetcar Named Desire is a psychological dramatization based on Tennessee Williams's play with the same name that was adapted to the silver screen.  Kazan did a brilliant job in directing the film and the cast performed splendidly with extremely strong performances by Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh.  The cinematography and mise-en-scene are excellent as it leaves the audience with a brilliant cinematic experience that provides much room for thought as Blanche deals with her inner struggles.
0553582453|5.0|Each and every book of this series has been outstanding.  The people are real, the story well thought out.  Finally we see the connection between the Farseer books and the Liveship Traders. I clued in just before I read about the Fool.  Alhough there is so much more Ms Hobb an do to expand on the middle trilogy.  Based on what I have read so far of Ms Hobb's, I will buy whatever she writes.  Although she says she will not write more of this world unless there is a real story to write ... I hope that happens.  There is a whole series just on the return of the Elderlings!   Anyway.  Oustanding book.  Outstanding series.  Outsdtanding writer.  Can't wait to read the next one, although I do it with a heavy heart if it's the last.
B0000AZKPC|5.0|It is an amazing album from the beginning until the end. There is not one song called filler. The vocalist is on top-notch and his voice is so high-pitched. Here who I rate the songs:<br />1. Blank File: The album starts fast and the vocals are amazing. This a beautiful melodic song and the guitar/keyboard solo is amazing. A nice start for this amazing album. 5/5<br />2. My Land: It starts soft and then it gets fast and hard in the middle. Very cool track, but nice. 4.5/5<br />3. 8th Commandement: This one is very good, and the chorus makes this song a killer, and the solo is great. One of the best tracks on the album. 5/5<br />4. Replica: Beautiful ballad and great lyrics in this song. Gets really exciting in the chorus parts. &quot;I'm a replica, I'm a replica&quot;. 5/5<br />5. Kingdom For A Heart: A fast song and great vocals, and the guitar/keyboards solo is good, but it isn't that of a favorite, but it is still good. 4.5/5<br />6. FullMoon: The first single of this album and it starts soft. Then, it gets really exciting. Very nice lyrics and I love themes about Full Moons and Werewolves. Pretty awesome. 5/5<br />7. Letter To Dana: WOW! AWESOME! This is my personal favorite song. Everything in this song peered perfect. It is a great ballad to listen to. Great vocals, great instrumanted, and great lyrics. Superb! 6/5<br />8. UnOpened: It is a likable song and fast, and it the other single of this marvelous album. So far, there are no bad songs. I like it and it is charming. Very enjoyable chorus. 4.75/5<br />9. Picturing The Past: It is a great song, but it is the less famous song on the album. I'm not saying it is a throw out, but it is a hardly heard song. 4/5<br />10. Destruction Preventer: It is the longest song on the album. Nice keyboarding in the beginning and then combined with the guitars. It starts fast, but in the middle it gets soft and then fast again. Nice chorus and in the end of the song; you'll hear the beginning of &quot;Letter To Dana&quot;. 5/5<br />Great atmospheric album and I think it is the perfect place to start to get into this great band. And maybe this band will be leendry band because they're just doing great.
B0001XAS1W|5.0|I bought the album at FYE today and the CD sounds better then ever! I like the Title Track as well as Lord Granville... Al is the master of the studio and This album really put Al into the American Market... <br />I think that Al is one of the best folk rockers of the 20th century and is a master of the stories in his songs... You will find yourself getting lost in the album and listening to it over and over.I am glad that Rhino is keeping the album alive in the 21 century...<br />I feel that Rhino should get the whole Al Stewart library... I promise that you will enjoy this CD.. I like <br />Year of the Cat<BR>Lord Granville<BR>If it doesn't come Naruraly Leave it<BR>and On the Border<br />This album is a great starting point for new fans to really get to know Al Stewart... I just wish that an interview track was on the US CD... Other then that the album is flawless!

As you turn the pages, you begin to wonder what the heck is going on on this island, and the more you read, the better it gets. However, be prepared for an ending that will rock your world!

6304025831|5.0|Sharon Stone should have won an award for her role as Ginger McKenna. I think her performance showed a lot of character, with the problems she developed with cocaine and liquor, and her great acting really was exposed when she was feuding with DeNiro, and she looked good for 42. She slept with a childhood friend of her husband, Joe Pesci's character Nick Santoro, so she was made to look like. . .well, you know. Even when she married someone that was a professional gambler, she never became addicted to gambling herself, and that's a testament to the movie, because that would have been the predictable thing to do. I also liked the way the casino in Las Vegas was viewed, in DeNiro's narrating of all of the staff members, and the secret rooms in the casino. This was all based on a true story, so the viewer is learning what it's like inside a real casino. Complaints that I've read have been about the really disgusting violent scenes, especially the one where the guys head is in a vice. I'm actually surprised, because I read those reviews before I watched the movie, and there were a lot more gross scenes (a man being stabbed to death, two people being buried alive in the same grave). But, I wasn't grossed out because it's really hard to tell the story accurately without including this. I don't like how some people complain that this movie has Joe Pesci swearing too much. The premise called for it. There was no way this could be a fairy tale.<BR>Anyhow, the 70's and the 80's were brought back nicely. There was a part where, either Joe Pesci or Robert DeNiro, narrating, talked about something that happened &amp;quote; back home, years ago &amp;quote; and then you see on the screen at the beginning of the next scene, &quot;BACK HOME, YEARS AGO.&quot; It was funny. This was a really great movie.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park's &quot;Meteora&quot; still sounds strong a full year later!  &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; is no contest to the rest of the album, which darts, rocks, ducks, screams and tears it up with the music!  The singing of Chester Bennington and the raps of DJ Shinoda clash and intertwine very well in the songs.  &quot;Don't Stay&quot;, &quot;Easier To Run&quot; (with its cool bridges and landscapes), &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;(very experimental), &quot;Lying&quot; (with its '80s inspired arena rock), &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot; (its hip-hop beats), and &quot;Numb&quot; are all dynamite as well as the other tracks!  A couple of songs sound like the ones from their debut &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, but they stick to their familiar sounds and vibes.  This is quite an aggressive, dynamic followup that I have been playing over and over during the past 14 months!
B000003TA4|1.0|Reviewer: This_is_a_RadioClash from CA<BR>It takes a fool not to realize that Nirvana and its sophomore album Nevermind are disgustingly overrated. Just look at the Amazon review of the album. &quot;Monumental urgency&quot;?! What a pretentious crock. If somebody would've recognized Cobain's &quot;monumental urgency&quot;, and done something about it, he would've been put in a padded cell for a few years where he belonged. It's downright sick how the media kisses this dead man's backside. He killed himself, and yet people have immortalized him for it. Kurt Cobain's music is every Nirvana fan's afterthought. First and foremost, his public image is why people love him; he was the embodiment of the heroin-ravaged popular &quot;loser&quot;. He was a good looking guy, so it was okay for him to &quot;rebell&quot; (i.e. act like he was an outsider when he was THE man to look to for being trendy). Another thing I don't like about Nevermind is how people were (and still are) claiming that it gave &quot;disillusioned&quot; and &quot;alienated&quot; teens a voice. I was one of those alienated and disillusioned kids, and I'm sure if I owned Nevermind it wouldn't have saved my scrawny frame from being beat down by the normals who loved Nevermind. Infact, they probably saw my not owning Nevermind and all the other popular jock rock as extra incentive to alienate us. Cobain, I salute you with a hearty &quot;F**k You&quot; for acting like you had life as bad as me and other teens. I can think of slews of late-80's, early-90's albums that were just as tweaked and polished as Nevermind, but had the balls not to hide it. Namely, Paula Abdul's &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot;. I'm not kidding... that was a great record (&quot;Straight Up&quot; is catchier and rocks more than everything Cobain ever did). Sure, it was an album of sugar-coated, hard-edged love songs, but I'll take that any day over sugar-coated, downright lies (Kurt NEVER slept under a bridge, and wasn't a Punker). When wasthe last time you saw or heard of a Punk Rocker with gorgeous long blond hippie hair and a perfectly-groomed goatee?
B00020HEG6|4.0|Sadly, we have set an unfairly high standard for certain film-score composers, and John Williams is at the top of that esteemed list.  His music for &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; has already been called &quot;more of the same&quot; in reference to two previous scores for the Harry Potter series.  This can be taken two ways.  I prefer to suggest it is a compliment.  True, Williams' music for this installment has its foundations in the earlier films, but it also offers quite a bit that is new.  The most obvious new turn is what seems an Elizabethan tone, especially with the school chorus of &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; (&quot;Double Trouble&quot;).  This of course would seem obvious since the lyrics are derived from Shakespeare's &quot;Macbeath.&quot;  By the way this choral arrangement is a fine touch (why has the notion of a school choir been absent up to now?).  He also slides into a comical mode with his &quot;Knight Bus&quot; theme which is an unexpected but delightful change of pace. Indeed, there are a number of new themes here that add depth (and some darkness)to an already rich musical brew.  All in all one must admit (and applaud) that Maestro William's &quot;toil and trouble&quot; is well worth the price.  This cauldron is full of delight.  Very well produced and packaged by Warner-Sunset/Nonesuch/Atlantic.
B000003TA4|5.0|One of the best albums ever, if not at least the best in the 90's; Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind,&quot; is fast, catchy, rock. Unlike anything else at the time on the charts, it destroyed 80's hair band forever (THANK GOD!) and opened the way for bands like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice and Chains and others to also get their music to the masses. Im not saying being part of pop-culture makes a band greater, but to all you Pearl Jam fans that hate Nirvana, lets all just get along and realize that both bands along with the others are great bands and definatlly made their make on rock. I still think Kurt was killed, anyone that thinks otherwise go watch the &quot;Unsolved Mysteries,&quot; episode of Kurt Cobain, and decide for yourselfs, everyone has their own opinon and thats kool, &quot;To each his own,&quot; so peace out and as Mr. Vedder said at the MTV awards with Neil Young, &quot;Keep on Rockin' in the Free World!&quot; peace
0962477060|5.0|There are a lot of positive reviews for this book. Here's another one.<BR>I've been playing on and off for 16 years. Took lessons a long time ago and have read countless books on the subject. Nothing comes close to accomplishing what this book did for me in 2 days.<br />I am familiar with music theory but on a very basic level. I never commmited certain things to memory (modes, circle of 5ths) but I can name the notes on the fretboard.<br />I had never heard of the CAGED method but was quite used to viewing chords as patterns on the neck as opposed to individual notes. This book took that fact and explained it in a way that had me playing all over the neck after ONE night studying it.<br />It will show you how there are only a few basic chord SHAPES that when played in a certain order will repeat themselves moving up the neck. For me, seeing this fact instantly opened my eyes to the layout of the fretboard and has given me the knowledge to greatly improve my playing because I can now move all over the neck and hit the right chords in ways that allow for easier soloing around them.<br />Some comment that this book is no substitute for conventional theory education. I'll agree to that (especially if you will be playing with assorted musicians) but firmly believe that there is also no substitute to this book and the method it lays out.<br />Everyone learns at a different pace and some things 'click' better for some people. For me, the CAGED method in two nights completely changed how I view the instrument, and has allowed my playing to open up considerably.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Although I thought \\"The English Patient\\" was OK, I liked \\"Cold Mountain\\" a lot more.  I really got into the authenticity of the time and place, and I felt the characters were much more believable than say the imaginary characters of \\"Gone with the Wind.\\"  At least no one in \\"Cold Mountain\\" tried to turn the curtains into gowns.  I always thought that was pretty unbelievable.  Anyway, for those of you who thought Minghella took great liberty with his adaptaion of \\"Cold Mountain,\\" then you should read \\"The English Patient.\\"  I thought he took greater liberty on that book.  The difference is is that it worked better in \\"Cold Mountain\\" than \\"The English Patient.\\"
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Slipknot is a good band but I feel they lost that dark side of them which expresses whats wrong with the world and society now they sing about faith it just feels weird.  If they make another cd it needs to be heavier then iowa.  This mainstream crap is ok but i hate mainstream so they better get their dark edge back
0671027387|3.0|Excellent beach book. Not exactly the intellectual thriller equivalent of Dickens, but overall, a worthy effort.<br />Brown's story here is that NASA - and two mud-slinging political opponants - are involved in a complex plot of (you guessed it!)...deception. NASA has \\"found\\" something in the ice at one of the poles, and is using this discovery to help swing the polls in time for an election. Needless to say, this is a superb book for anyone who enjoys reading about conspiracies; this seems to contain the ultimate governmental conspiracy.<br />Is it far fetched? Yes. But forseeable, as well.<br />In my mind, this is what makes Brown such an excellent \\"suspense\\" writer: He takes the utterly feasible and transmorgifies it into something which, albeit far-fetched, is still probable.<br />While the story twists and turns innumerous times, it is still easy to follow. Rachel Sexton is a convincing character, and while she remains - along with the rest of the characters - only superficially developed, it's not much of a problem. This novel doesn't exactly pack a mental punch.<br />While reading it, it seemed interesing and held my attention well enough: I finished this in about five days. The story was fast paced and everything was explained fairly well. Like the other Brown book I've read, \\"Angels and Demons,\\" the ending had something to be desired: It seemed like Rachel and Michael fell out of character too far for me to believe the ending. Looking back, the characters seem blocky and superficial (definitely the latter), the dialogue is forced...<br />Truth is, Brown isn't such a good writer, but he sure as shoot knows how to craft an excellent story. If you can get past the mechanics and 'flow' problems, this is an excellent book to just kick back and read: It is easy to read and doesn't condescend the reader, unlike many techno-thrillers of the day.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne's new album &quot;Under My Skin&quot; shows how much she's grown since &quot;Let Go&quot;. With out a doubt in my mind this is better than &quot;Let Go&quot;. &quot;Under My Skin&quot; shows not only that Avril CAN write her own music, but also that she has grown-up alot since &quot;Let Go&quot;. I got the album today (after seeing her perform on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;) and I love every song. The song's Avril wrote for this album shows us a glimpse of what has happened in her life, as well as what happens in other peoples lives. This album in my opinion will do well, very well. The only thing left to say is I hope I have a chance to see these songs performed life, and can't wait to see what she throws our way next.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|So Avril decieded to drop her producing team and make the album her way, how did that go? Well, I think it turned out pretty darn good. Those who complain that she's too teeny bopper will be pleasently surprised by this CD - that is, if they're not so closed minded that they refuse to even give it a chance. <br />As a whole, I'd say this CD is an improvement from Avril's first. You have stand out catchy tracks like &quot;He Wasn't&quot; and &quot;Happy Ending&quot; and slower, moodier tracks like &quot;Forgotten&quot; and &quot;Take Me Away&quot; all of which, in my opinion, are written quite nicely (Though I'm sure the lyrics are up to debate, heh). This album is notably missing songs like &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, which might disapoint some fans - but I think me (and most people) are glad they're gone. It gives this CD a more artistic tone and... its a good CD, give it a chance! Don't pass it up just because its Avril, you might be surprised.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I'm a devout fan of Slipknot's first two albums, and even some of their older material in the pre-Corey days. However, this record takes them to a whole new level.  I now see that Corey is capable of far more than he originally seemed. As KoRn did with Untouchables, he finally tries out a more melodic approach to a slightly more old-school metal sound.  Frankly, the results are incredible.  The prelude here isn't a hellish descent into insanity like the two preceding it;  it's an amazing introduction that actually lures us in, rather than drag us kicking and screaming. I couldn't be happier with the new direction they're taking. Let's just hope they don't go the way of KoRn and completely blow this with a terrible follow-up.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|MY OPINION: I have been a loyal Slipknot fan since 2000, when I picked up the self-titled at the local Sam Goody after I heard Wait and Bleed over the speakers. I must say, when I first heard Duality (the single) I thought, &quot;They're goin soft. Corey's mixed Stone Sour with the Knot and ruined all.&quot; I couldn't be more wrong. I know most fans are screaming &quot;sell outs&quot;, but if you really listend to this, you'd see that this is a very talented, mature band. Not one song is bad. On to the review.<br />1.Prelude 3.0-Great way to open the album. The music doesn't sound at all like the old Slipknot, but hell, it's still awesome. 10/10<BR>2.The Blister Exists-WHOA. Great, great song. Insane drumming skills by the master, Joey. 10/10<BR>3.Three Nil-Sweet song. Not sure what it's about though. 10/10<BR>4.Duality-Ah, the single. First time I heard it, I wasn't real fond of it, but it's grown on me now. Infact, it's one of my favorite Knot songs. 10/10<BR>5.Opium of the People-Interesting and catchy. 9/10<BR>6.Circle-The single best song on this album. Really shows off the groups musical talents. 10/10<BR>7.Welcome-Great, heavy song. This is a wonderful song. 10/10<BR>8.Vermilion-Awesome. Nothin more to say. 10/10<BR>9.Pulse of the Maggots-Ingenious song. The siren at the begining is awesome. This song really gets you goin and headbanging. 10/10<BR>10.Before I Forget-Probably one of the weaker tracks. Still really good though. 8/10<BR>11.Vermilion Pt. 2-Awesome again. 10/10<BR>12.The Nameless-Another good track. 9/10<BR>13.The Virus of life-Great song. 10/10<BR>14.Danger-Keep Away-Another sort of weak track. Still good though.8/10<BR>BOTTOM LINE-This album is top-notch. If you like Slipknot then you should like this. Only narrow minded maggots won't like this. Rock on and stay (sic).
B00001QEE8|4.0|jungle book is an enjoyable and funny film it is wonderful for children and i thought it was good as well.
B0000AZT72|4.0|First off, I'm going to agree with pretty much everyone here, the scenes with Kung Fu are done excellently. The effects, although ridiculous are quite cool.  <br />Now my (minor) gripes:<br />- There's no way to skip to the menu while the disc is initially loading. This isn't a big deal the first time, but it does get kind of annoying to have to sit through the warnings and logo screens.<br />- The story kind of falls over itself towards the end. That might be kind of predictable given that this team would have destroyed everyone in the competition, but it kind of betrays the point of these guys playing together (to spread the word about Shaolin kung fu) when it looks like every team but the scrubs knows a little kung fu.<br />Other than that though, it is quite fun to watch.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This has to be absolutely the BEST CD I have EVER heard.  I never expected such a more soft CD from Slipknot.  This is excellent work.  I think that this CD would actually appeal to anyone.  If your new to Slipknot, I would recommend listening to this CD first.  I am a maggot for life and that will definately not change.  Slipknot, keep up the amazing work and rock on!
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Ok so, I don't want to go into a big &quot;blah blah&quot; statement here. I'll try to keep this short.<br />In the first movie Neo is determined to free all humans from their enslavement by machines.In the end he makes a deal with the source to save Zion after it's pretty much destroyed. His deal is to let the machines continue to use humans as an energy source as long as they leave Zion alone.<br />In the first Matrix Neo is &quot;the one&quot;, then in the second he isn't the &quot;one&quot;, but one of many. Despite this he manages to transgress part of his humanity and actually has the ability to affect the machines in the physical world. In the third he can destroy the machines, and yet when confronted with the source does nothing. He strikes a deal.<br />In the first Matrix, Trinity is knowledgeble, powerful, a leader if only by example. In the second she's still tough, but nearly gets killed. Neo saves her from her untimely death; a death that would have made sense in the second movie. Trinity would have died for a reason, her personal &quot;greater good&quot;. In the third movie she dies, because she dies. Her big kiss off is supposed to be alright because she found Neo. whatever.<br />Mr. Smith is a funny albeit normal agent in the first Matrix. In the second he is freed from the enslavement of the Matrix. That part is still kind of a , &quot;huh?&quot; to me, but it's okay because I love his character. In the third movie ,when it looks as though he could wipe out the Matrix, Neo stops him. Why? Losing all humankind is still better than submission to a force that could destroy you at any given time if you ask me. Besides you'd still have Zion, depending on whether or not they did what I'm about to mention.<br />Zion in the first Matrix is the last bastion of humans that the machines can't get to. In the second we see it, and it's a well gaurded city. We then discover they are drilling down. After the machines breach Zion and start swarming in; the human faction engages in closed combat with them. At a certain point in the third movie they use EMP bombs and it decimates a whole room full of squidies (machines). Why not place loads of these bombs while you have time in the second movie, ahead of where they are drilling, and have your forces fall back. It would have been a lot more economical than wasting complex machinery and human lives on an obviously ridiculous battle.<br />In going to a movie I'm asking to be whisked away for my $9. I don't go to a movie, let alone a sci-fi movie to be let down by a character I've invested time, money and aspirations in. I beleived Neo in the first movie when he says, &quot;I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see&quot;. When he agrees to let people stay batteries so that a single half destroyed city can stay intact, I'm heartbroken. I feel sold out. It's the equivalent of Luke Skywalker turning to the dark side and killing all his friends at the end of Star Wars, or Sauron getting the ring of power in the end of Lord of the Rings. Here's a little secret 'tween us; what made Lord of the Rings successful besides it's huge preexistant fan base, was that there was lots of hardship and struggle, just like the Matrix, but in the end even if by happenstance and luck the destruction of the ring took place. We got our money's worth, and our dedication and time spent payed off. I would have loved to see a good third Matrix, but alas I was deeply disappointed. My only regret is that I couldn't give this movie zero stars.
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido's created a vibe here. The songs carry weight independantly. However, this is the kind of cd that you won't skip through, suffice it you enjoy melodic, soothing music. Her singing is not aggressive, therefore the lyrics won't feel pushed into your subconscious mind. You're not likely to find yourself by the office cooler singing about your man that done left you, although the choruses are catchy enough that a tune may get stuck in your head from time to time. I'm not a huge fan of videos, but the one for White Flag was cute, if you like David Boreanaz, or the idea that love can jack you up forever, no matter who you are. Dido shows her creativity here as much as before. Do we sense just a touch more of a laid back feeling? Maybe. She's probably just coming into her own as a commercially successful songwriter. If it is at all like surfing, I hope she continues to ride the wave and not crash into the monotonous sellout zone.
0767805712|5.0|This is a great movie! I didn't know anything about this movie until last night. I can't believe how I missed this movie. It's about discrimination, faith and human potential.

B0001CCXZW|5.0|I am sure every one has their own reference point for viewing \\"Gilmore Girls,\\" especially if they really like the show.  Since I am neither a mother nor a daughter my frame of reference is not in the real world but in the ghost of a television show past, namely \\"Moonlighting.\\"  This might strike some of your as odd, but on \\"Gilmore Girls\\" the average script for an episode is usually 75-80 pages versus the 45-50 for a normal hour-long television program, which was pretty much the math I remember from Glenn Gordon Caron's hit series (1985-89) which reminded America who Cybil Shepherd was and introduced the world to Bruce Willis.  The nice thing about \\"Gilmore Girls\\" is that unlike Dave and Maddie we do not need to fear that Lorelai and Rory will do the same thing to mess up their chemistry (they will have to find some other way).<br /><br />Set in the storybook Connecticut town of Stars Hollow, which is populated by an eccentric mix of folks, the Gilmore girls are 32-year-old Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and 16-year-old Rory (Alexis Bledel).  When Lorelai was Rory's age she became an unwed mother, to the disappointment of her parents (Kelly Bishop and Edward Herrmann), not to mention generations of Gilmore ancestors probably going back to the \\"Mayflower.\\" But Lorelai has carved out her own life, managing an inn, and having a relationship with Rory which is more like best friends than mother and daughter.  The only problem is that Rory has her heart set on going to Harvard and being able to attend Chilton, a private school in Hartford, would be a big help.  That means Lorelai has to ask her parents for help and the price is steep: every Friday Lorelai and Rory have to go to dinner at the Gilmore mansion.  Good thing Lorelai really loves her daughter a whole bunch.<br /><br />I can explain why I like \\"Gilmore Girls\\" simply by pointing out that on Disc 6 of \\"The Complete First Season\\" where we have the episode \\"Rory's Dance\\" enhanced by pop ups explaining all the pop culture, historical, and other references, I did not need any of them.  In fact, I caught a couple of lines where I thought they could have added some pop ups.  I am a bit weak on current musical groups, but fortunately Rory has eclectic tastes in such regards, so there are still more hits than misses.  Absolutely true that people do not talk like this in the real world, but they should, even if that means you have to put up with a lot of eye rolling and sighs being heaved your way.<br /><br />The supporting cast is wonderful.  Melissa McCarthy as Sookie St. James may well be the Willow of the thirtysomething generation and if Lorelai and Luke (Scott Patterson) are the last too people in town to know they are meant for each other they will have to catch on eventually, 1000 yellow daisies not withstanding.  Keiko Agena as Lane Kim and Liza Weil as Paris Geller provide the polar opposites of Rory's divided teenage existence for the female gender with Jared Padalecki as Dean Forester and Chad Michael Murray as Tristan DuGrey doing the duty for the other side.<br /><br />But the heart of this series is indeed the Gilmore girls, all three of them.  Graham is like a standup comedienne who does not mind if no one gets her cracks because she knows how good they are even if others are waiting for the pop ups.  Bledel, whose only previous credit was as an extra in \\"Rushmore,\\" is simply someone that the camera loves and who has a way of speaking that is even more endearing.  Then there is Bishop as Lorelai's mother, a picture of being prim and proper but desperate to maintain contact with her daughter, even though she is loathe admitting it.  Lorelai and her mother have a reputation that has been deeply damaged, perhaps irrevocably; but that is why we have to stay tune.  Meanwhile Rory is building a relationship with her grandparents at those Friday night dinners separate from the existing hostility.<br /><br />The series is unique it that it is the first series to make it to the airsupported by the Family Friendly Forum's Script Development Fund, an initiative between some of the nation's top advertisers and the WB network.

0930289528|4.0|Just re-read 'V for Vendetta' again, to see what I thought of it after all these years. Putting aside all of the book's political, scientific and socialogical naivites (some of which Moore himself points out in the introduction and afterward), this story is shockingly effective, if a bit heavy handed, and yes, depressing. <br />In re-reading it, V comes off as less than a character and more as the polemic abstract that Moore intended. Yes, V's drive toward anarchy is little hard to swallow, and being asked to sympathise with a terrorist in light of today's world is difficult ( which is the main obstacle I see in this story ever making it to the movie screen, that, and the overriding British-ness of the story, which I understand is integral and which I appreciate. Too much would be lost in transplanting this to an American setting). <br />Also, there are some unexplained plot holes: one being just how does V gain access to the fate computer? Without being detected?  <br />That said, the first third of this book is still impossible to put down, really great stuff (aside from some character stumbles: V spouts quotes and exposites and it comes off as intially awkward), as the authorities unravel why V may doing what he's doing, but I really enjoyed the middle section this time, which chronicles Evey out on her own. The scene where she is captured and confined is still harrowing and mind-blowing. <br />All in all, I see this as a very personal and well-crafted story by Alan Moore, although people always want to compare it to Watchmen in terms of quality and realism. Bear in mind that it was serialized in its initial run and created over seven years. David Lloyd's artwork, while at times muddy (I still have trouble telling who's who in the last third), is also often brilliantly rendered, cinematic, and very effective. He has a way with a panel or facial expression that is attuned perfectly to the emotions conveyed by the story. Moore wrote at the time that he would not finish the story's run with any other artist, and one can see why.  <br />Again, as Moore explains the book's evolution in the afterward, this is the work of younger, hungry and sometimes naive artists. As a comic work I find it moving, magnificent and compelling.

B00005RDSM|5.0|This movie animates one of the most imaginative plays ever written, albeit with a little 'Disneyfication.' It's by far my favorite; there is an enjoyably long spectrum of characters. Every time I watch this movie, it takes me back to those times I wish I was in Never-Never-Land.<br />P.S. The claim that this movie is an allegory to the JFK years is easily refutable, since this movie was made in 1953, while the play is over a century old.

Forget the concept albums and give me a heavy metal classic!
140003180X|3.0|This is the fourth installment in the #1 Ladies Detective Agency series and once again Mr. Smith gives us a dose of African pleasure.<br />Precious Ramotswe finds a cure for her fiance Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni's depression and they are back on track. Her assistant Mma Makutsi starts her own typing class for men and falls in love. We get to know the apprentist mechanics a bit better and meet a few more interesting characters in search of mystery solutions from the detective agency. A few scenes are laugh out loud funny. Another enjoyable and easy read from Alexander McCall Smith.<br />I rated this book one star less than the others in this series because of the fact that I felt portions of this book were repeats of the prior ones. I wish that author's who write a series would just allow the books to stand on their own without feeling the need to explain over and over again who and what the characters are. If a reader picks up the fourth book in a series without reading the first three.....isn't that the readers problem. I would have prefered more character's searching for answers than answers to questions that were already provided.
B00005LANG|4.0|I love Bob Marley, his lyrics and delivery. But, I listen to him alot mainly because of his band The Wailers. Aston Familyman, Carlton, Wya, Anderson etc. Superb musicians who do not get enough credit yet they were 'holding it down' for Bob. He knew their value which is good. Try getting Survival &amp; Rastaman Vibration. Now, that's Roots Reggae!

B000089Q9D|5.0|I loved this film in its theatrical release in 1989.  I certainly felt it deserved the Academy Award (for best foreign language film).  I also loved seeing the full version that lays out all the details of the relationships, and their resolution.<br /><br />I also enjoyed reading everyone's opinion as to whether the original version or the longer one is better.  I can't decide myself.  But a critical point to make is that THIS DVD contrains both versions (on either side of the DVD).  So regardless of which you prefer (and here is the perfect opportunity to find out), it is on this version.
0671027387|5.0|Saying Dan Brown is a good thriller writer, or just a good writer doesn't give him enough credit for the work he puts into all his books. All of his information is accurate and usually fascinating, informing me of things unbelievable and yet unknown. All of the cool technology, characters, research and plots in this book amaze me and I feel as though I could read then book 5 times and still wonder how he creates a suspenseful, yet realistic world filled with descriptive characters and twisted plots.<br /> Deception Point is another of Dan Brown's masterpieces filled with deep plots, deception, and the usual brilliance that fills his novels. Deception Point is a story about a mysterious object found deep in a polar iceberg. The president of the United States, Zach Hearney, sends up four civilian scientists and his white house informative, Rachel Sexton, to verify NASA'S breakthrough find. This discovery comes at a helpful time to NASA and President Hearney. (...) . Senator Sedgewick Sexton, also Rachel's father, is running for the title of President, and some good NASA news would only help President Hearney, who strongly supported the program. This makes the find great, but not what makes it incredible. I will admit that finding alien life is a bit corny to fuel a book on, but the development and political scandal in protecting the information is what kept me turning the pages until late in the night.<br /> Like in all of Brown's other books the characters in Deception Point change and reveal their true nature and intentions. It would be easy to see the true culprit, if not for Brown's deceiving writing that leads the reader to believe the evil character is really someone else.<br /> I will admit that some of the rescues the characters happen upon are unlikely, but Brown probably gave them with the most creativity he could, and still make them seem somewhat plausible.<br /> Altogether, reading Deception Point would not be a waste of time, and presents itself to the reader quite easily, making an easy read, a good laugh, and an intriguing plot to spend your day wondering about.ite easily, making an easy read, a good laugh, and an intriguing plot to spend your day wondering about.
B00003CXAE|5.0|I've never been a big musical fan but who could resist a movie like GREASE?<br />It's rare when a movie can take a look at a time in America and manage to capture all the fun that period had to offer.  Being based on a well-established musical play helped, I'm sure, but I also think all the other elements--especially that dynamite cast--really helped.<br />I was a teenager in the 70's when it came out and, looking back at it now, I appreciate the filmmakers' respectful approach to the period and characters while gently poking fun at the 50's.  I doubt such a film could be made now: the characters would be caricatures and Hollywood would want to &quot;right any wrongs&quot; of the era, I'm sure.<br />(Check out the review by the person &quot;offended&quot; by the roles of girls in the movie/1950s.  I'll bet every teenage girl in the 50's had more fun being a girl than that person in the 00's ranting about it.  Yikes, calm down.)<br />I loved the extras.  The recent interviews with the cast and the footage from the Hollywood premiere.<br />Mom and Dad had their youth in the 50's and we got to watch it on the movie screens of 1978.<br />Now the grandkids get to watch it on their portable DVD players.<br />GREASE is still the word.
1401300901|1.0|The first chapter or two - simply delightful. As you keep reading, you get the sense that the author became quickly bored -but clearly not as bored as the proofreader. Grab a copy just to spot the many misspellings. The book is very schizophrenic between American spelling and English. Humor, humour; mom, mum; color, colour - peppered throughout this book, marking it as a terribly put together piece of work. The story quickly becomes very mundane and drags on with irrelevant fillers. The only reason this book went into print, was through obvious nepotism - the author is the daughter of Ireland's Prime Minister. My main reason for purchasing this book (although now I kick myself for doing so) was to have a lighthearted book to read through in one evening. Unfortunately, I spent more time trying to figure out why the grammar and spelling were so off. The author has a degree in journalism, but left to write this book. Clearly she wasn't cut out to write at all. Sorry to say this, but anyone who likes this book is intellectually lazy.
B000005RS0|5.0|This album, along with Prince's Purple Rain, and Bruce Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A., was the biggest selling album of 1984.  It sold over 10 million copies worldwide.  It went straight to number 1 in Europe and and peaked at #3 in America.  <br />The first track is a purley autobiographical song called I Might Have Been Queen. Its a great opening track.  Next is What's Love Got To Do With It.  This was the biggest hit of the album going to #1 in America for 3 weeks and going gold.  It also won her 3 grammys.  Show Some Respect is a rock number that peaked at #37 in America.  Most people probably recognize I Cant Stand the Rain from Missy Elliots remixed version.  Private Dancer was on Tina's best recordings.  It was also a huge hit hitting #7 in America.  Let's Stay Together, the cover of the Al Green classic, is considered Tina's comeback song.  It was her first solo hit, reaching #1 in Europe and #26 in America.  Better Be Good To Me is Tina at her rock n roll best.  This song also won Tina a Grammy for best Female Rock Vocal.  Steel Claw simply rocks and proves why Tina is the Queen.  Help is a gossiple flavored version of the Beatles #1 hit.  The last song is a David Bowie composition called 1984.  The year the album was made, the song is kinda spooky.<br />Private Dancer is not only Tina's biggest album, and her comeback album, but it is also a great piece of music from one of the best artist of our time.  Its a classic pure rock n roll record and I recomend it to everybody.
B000002UAR|5.0|In a recent poll taken as to which albums were the finest ever,rolling stone placed revolver at number 3,while vh1 claimed it to be the greatest ever,awarding it the coveted number 1 spot!!!!!! I guess its true what was said back in 1966,tommorrow never knows... oh,its true!!!!!!!!!
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Showing that there is nothing so dreadful as a Bad Idea whose time has come, the producers of The Matrix take the bad idea that was the original Matrix and proceed to run it into the ground.  While continuing to cling to the pretentious notion that they are moving into uncharted territories of existentialist thought, the comic book geek brothers proceed only to revel even more in spectacular orgy of mind-numbing special effects --- but precious little else.  This movie was so bloated by its own self-indulgences & production values that it even disenchanted good numbers of passionate Matrix devotees who were snookered by the first film.  Suffice it to say, those of us who thought that the original movie was nothing a bunch of pretentious horse manure felt that the sequel only affirmed our opinions.<br />Really, for all the ballyhoo that this trilogy received, is anyone real going to give a rip about these movies in 10 years?  In a decade, the special effects will look hilariously outdated --- so all you will be left with is the empty pontificating of the movies.  These movies are getting more forgettable by the second.
B000089RVX|4.0|I am so sick of people whining about Evanescence.  They're a popular band.  Deal with it!  Most of the negative reviews on Amazon don't even address the music.  They launch into some self-righteous tirade about musical politics in a pathetic attempt to sound intelligent, when in fact nobody really cares about what they're saying.  Listen to music for the MUSIC and get over whatever superficial problems you have with the musical group.  Just because they're popular doesn't mean they sold out.  Some people, apparently, would rather see them struggle in the streets rather than make a half-decent living while at the same time exposing their music to a larger audience to appreciate it.<BR>Anyway, on to what's important: the CD.  I love these songs, and I'm proud of it.  I guess you just have to take my word that I like them for the music and not because I'm brainwashed by MTV.  Amy Lee deserves all the credit she gets for her beautiful, occasionally haunting voice, which belts out a wide range of solid melodies on every track without fail.  Most of the songs are in the vein of Going Under, hard-hitting rock with a touch of metal and the surreal.  Bring Me to Life is the most energetic song I've heard in a long while, really serving as a sort of catharsis after a long day of boredom or frustration.  My Immortal stands out as a real testament to the power of Amy's voice, which is heartbreaking and yet somewhat cold at the same time here.  The CD is wonderfully multi-purpose; whether you're working out, looking to relieve an excess of negative energy, or just sitting down to think, Fallen fits the occasion every time.  (I sound like the host of a fashion show.)<BR>My only real complaint is that the songs that do not immediately stand out tend to meld together.  I love Whisper, Everybody's Fool, and Tourniquet, but I'd be hard-pressed to come up with many distinct differences between them.  But that's really somewhat of a minor complaint; any time I can listen to a whole CDwithout having to skip a track is a 4-star experience in my book.  Overall, Evanescence is certainly a worthwhile purchase if you like the samples or one or more of their hits.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|i'm a big britney fan...and i'm also an avril fan. i knew that avril was going to be big when she came out with complicated and a great album, let go. i've been following her ever since so when i heard this album, i was really happy but not surprised that it is really really REALLY good. you can relate to a lot of things she sings about and her lyrics are much more mature now that she doesn't have the matrix writing with her. THANK GOD the matrix didn't write any songs. i am SURE this album will convert many and her fan base will widen, although i think they could've picked better singles to release than don't tell me or my happy ending, which i heard was next.. my fave tracks are together, freak out, how does it feel, forgotten, who knows, fall to pieces, slipped away. haha that's practically the whole album!

B0001NBMBC|5.0|Starting with the first few seconds of the first song...you know this is a more mature and developed band.  This album has it all, from rip your face off metal to amazing softer songs that no one knew Slipknot was capable of pulling off.  It's the good old slipknot track 1 through 5 and they take on a whole new venue with song 6 &quot;Circles&quot;.  Without a doubt, Circle is the best song on this album in my eyes.  Everything about it makes me want to hear it again and again because it's just written so well and it's from a band you wouldn't expect this sort of music from.<br />Anyone willing to give Slipknot a listen without their mind set on every song being like that from IOWA will definately love this CD.  Out of the 3, this is by far my favorite and it gets better everytime I listen.  If you're willing to hear something extremely well written from a band really starting to find themselves, you have to pick this up.
B00005JMEW|4.0|In this film noir tale written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, an assassin called the Bride (Uma Thurman) is shot at her wedding by her employer, Bill (David Carradine), and other members of their assassin circle. She survives, though a bullet in her brain keeps her in a coma for five years. Setting out for some payback, the Bride hunts down the various assassins, saving Bill for last. This is the first half of a planned two-part movie.
B000001GPX|5.0|After years of performing and listening to these works there is very little that can be said negatively of the perfection of this particular set of sessions done in the mid 1970s.  Kleiber really unleashes the most incredible sound from the VPO since the days of Solti.  We also are treated to the warmest tone and the most incredible Brass and Woodwind work ever to be put to disc. <br />I also find one thing in the 7th intro quite amazing.  Simply the tempo being slow is so right and played with such precision as to be breathetaking...the transition to the fast 6/8 is arguably the finest interpretation of this music without ever sounding forced.  <br />The Beethoven 5th has the most incredibly tight opening ever as well.  Surely one wonders why Kleiber is not more popular!!!
B000000Y2F|5.0|I'm giving this disc 5 stars, because it features Jazz greats in their prime, with amazing talent. However, I guess I should have paid closer attention to the song listings, because with so few tracks, this disc has only about 37minutes of music. I was hoping for more. It would act as a great introduction to Jazz for the novice, I would highly recommend it in that. For the real fan, there are lenghtier discs which would better serve your cashflow.
0316666343|3.0|I really liked the perspective - the girl's thoughts from heaven - and the writing was excellent. The examples of how different people react to tragedy was poignant. However, the plot kept swirling around in different directions and never fleshed anything out fully. Am I the only one who was thinking when she came back to earth how disgusting and disrespectful to use the body of her friend (really just an acquaintance in life) and no contraception!
B000089CJI|1.0|this really suks, are all you people smoking too much dope?
B0001UL7RY|5.0|this cd is the best cd i have every purchased. there is not a bad thing about it. it is so awesome. even better than the first!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|pretentious garbage. I would rather watch a root canal performed on a baby, and I love kids.
B00005JMEW|1.0|This movie combines extraordinary amounts of violence with almost no plot at all. I'm not a prudish person: I'm all in favor of violence that is reasonable and enhances a movie (eg. soldiers in a combat zone getting blown up). By contrast, the violence in this film is grotesque, unbelievable, and serves no particular function. The plot could be summarized without loss on an average-size napkin (woman gets beaten up and raped, recovers, and travels the world slaughtering members of the responsible gang).<br />That this movie has been (and continues to be) so enormously popular is a frightening testament to both the herd mentality that prevails amongst movie-watchers and our society's numbness to gore and brutality. I recieved this movie as a gift, and I am sorry to have unwittingly contributed to its success. One star is too much.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This cd is genius.only few bands can put acoustic guitars in their songs and make it rock.oh no,let's cry that corey dosen't scream like a madman but like he does in stone sour......the music is still extremely heavy.my personal favorite is &quot;Before I Forget&quot;.the opening is great.This cd leaked on the internet about 2 weeks ago and i admit that i downloaded it but trust me this cd is much better than the internet versions.this cd is great,and i suggest you buy it.don't always listen to what the critics say about the cd.have your own opinion on it.
B000002IOJ|5.0|Testament has once again proven that they are not a Metallica rip off band with this cd. I just don't see what the hell the big comparison is that they have with Metallica.Sure Metallica had this sound way before Testament came out,but don't forget that Metallica got their sound from the New Wave of British Metal(Mercyful Fate, Diamond Head,Budgie) that was coming out in the early eighties. So why the hell does everybody have to piss and moan and say, &quot; Oh Metallica did it first&quot; what a crock man. Testament's Practice What you Preach is an Awesome thrash effort with alot of great guitar work by the one and only Scolnick(who kicks the crap out of Kirk Hammet by the way). The great thing about Testament is that you don't get bored with their albums. They have you going all the way through banging your head in the middle of Five o'clock traffic and screaming all the way down the expressway. Greag Christian is also one of the best bass players I've heard since Cliff or Dave from Megadeth.So just do yourself a favor and ignore the reviews that say they copy Metallica and find out for yourselves if you think this is a rip-off band.Testament Kicks ass
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I was totally blown away by this album. The first 2 cds were Hard and heavy, and raw. this one carries on some of those elements but also other elements for soem of the bands side projects, (ie Stone Sour, To my Surprise and Murderdolls).  The range on the vocals by corey are sweet and the drum line for \\"duality\\" is a reminder of their 1st 2 cds.  They brought a lot to the table and in my opinion, it payed off. they might loss soem hardcore bands so going \\"soft\\", or \\"selling out\\", and people might lable them as \\"Slip-Sour\\" and if they do, then they aren't true fans and are ignorent and if they still think that this cd sucks then they are they type that would of liked slipknot to break up.
B0001LJCPC|4.0|if we're thinking of the same tune, the song that plays while the end credits roll is Goodnight Moon by Shivaree
B000002UAU|2.0|The oom-pah band behind behind When I'm 64, the fumbling sitar on Within You Without You, and the orchestra behind She's Leaving Home don't exactly make for great rock music.  Perenially overrated, this will always be a controversial album.  Overall, many releases from the late 60s have held up much, much, better.
B00006F83Y|5.0|plain and simple this is the best album ever recorded.  i have owned this album for over a year and it remains my favorite cd.  There is not a weak song on the album. except for maybe mosquito song, but all that song is is a whole lot of truth. those are some of the most insightful lyrics i have ever heard.  i still cant figure out why that song isnt being used by every bug spray company ever.  Songs for the dead is the best non single ever with all that crazy guitar and awesome lyrics.  the truth is one could listen to this album everyday for a year and never get sick of it.  Although that someone might lose their voice after about a week becuase it is impossible not to sing along to this album after listening to it a couple of times. and becuase some of the few swreams are totally crazy. the only thing to say about this album is that it will totally freak your beans.  After you buy this album you will forever be enchanted by the trippy basslines of nick oliveri, the insane guitar licks of mark lanegan and josh homme and the crazy drum beats of dave grohl. as well as the vocal stylings of josh homme, nick oliveri and mark lanegan <BR>the only part that sucks about this album is that this is probably the last qotsa album unless they get back together
B00005I44H|5.0|This set really proves why Perahia is the greatest pianist to ever live.  It may not be difficult for a concert pianist to &quot;play&quot; Mozart.  But I've never heard it played this way...not Brendel, Barrenboim, Ashkenazy (though hes a close second), nobody.  Perahia simply, makes the music perfect.  Sometimes too perfect in fact.  This set includes some annoying splices, and there is an analog hiss.  Not really bothersome to me though.  One thing I will say that bothered me, is that my set came without liner notes.  I don't know if this is supposed to be.  For those who enjoy further background on the music theyre listening to and are not Mozart veterans, may be disappointed with the lack of information in this set.  Otherwise, this set is the greatest one.  Check out Perahia's Bach, Beethoven and Chopin as well.
B00004TH6O|5.0|the only album that compares to this is songs for the deaf but that dosent count cause its the best cd ever.   there is no counting the times i have blasted this cd and ran around my house wearing nothing but a fake red beard screaming &quot;baby baby your so sweeeet&quot;  then jumped off my balcany and screamed &quot;im so old and your so young&quot;.  and theres no saying how many times ive seen a little girl walking down the street and had the wonderful words of nick oliveri come to mouth....<br />this cd rocks
B0001UL7RY|5.0|If you don't like the cd, fine, David Spell, but don't rate 1 star 3 times!!!  : P<BR>I think if you like punk music, this cd is great!  And Britney Spears's cd is pretty good too.
0689835604|5.0|My 1 year old daughter loves this book. The flaps work easily for her and the illustrations are wonderful. Great for teaching body parts too. Can't go wrong with this purchase.
078401213X|5.0|This along with Requiem For A Dream are very good movies.  Although I thought that Requiem for a Dream was better I still rate this movie with 5 stars.  I have to give it to Darren for his style and plot.  The first time i saw this movie i didnt like it one bit.  Then after about a year i met this girl who like the same kinda movies that i like and she kept telling me that it was a great movie and all.  So finally i said what the hell and i saw it in a for sale rack somewhere for like 5 dollars and i bought it i figured what the hell if i dont like it i can give it away to her.  So i bought it and watched it that night and she was right it was a great movie.  I like the whole idea of the world having a pattern.  And i also love the techniques that Darren Aronofsky uses with the camera in front of the actors face. I love that!  But overall this was a good movie.
B00004YZFQ|5.0|Despite the bad sound and grainy film quality, this is a riveting, brutal documentary that focuses on the 1969 free concert at Altamont Speedway that was envisioned by the Rolling Stones as a fun time for everyone to &quot;get it on&quot;, and ended with chaos and someone being killed, which is shown in the film. With the Hell's Angels in charge of security, and a vast crowd in a senseless and often aggressive drug induced stupor, watching this evolve is like looking into the abyss of the damned. The mid and late '60s were not the flower-power love generation years some remember through rose-tinted lenses, they were very often violent and hateful, as anyone who saw the rabble &quot;express themselves&quot; at the 1968 Democratic Convention can attest. There are people who blame the outcome of this concert on the Hell's Angels, but this film proves that they were only a part of the problem.<br />There is also much pretension: Guys in suits trying to be hip and cool, and Melvin Belli, the celebrity attorney of his day, making sure he gets his 15 minutes of camera time. The Rolling Stones (at this point Mick Taylor had replaced Brian Jones, who had died in July of that year) seem to be out of place in dealing with their fame, and trying to &quot;act the part&quot;, as well as being in a fog of substance abuse. Mick Jagger is the one that appears to be the most &quot;in control&quot;, and he tries his best to bring calm and order to the concert crowd, to no avail.<br />There are short sequences of other groups, like the Jefferson Airplane, and musically, perhaps the best part in the entire film is Tina Turner, as she sings &quot;I've Been Loving You Too Long&quot; all the while using the microphone as a substitute love interest.<br />Total running time is 91 minutes.<br />All or in part, the songs performed by the Stones are:<br />&quot;Honky Tonk Man&quot;<br />&quot;Brown Sugar&quot;<br />&quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;<br />&quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash&quot;<br />&quot;Love in Vain&quot;<br />&quot;Satisfaction&quot;<br />&quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;<br />&quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;<br />&quot;Under My Thumb&quot;<br />&quot;Wild Horses&quot;<br />&quot;You Gotta Move&quot;>&quot;Satisfaction&quot;<BR>&quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;<BR>&quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;<BR>&quot;Under My Thumb&quot;<BR>&quot;Wild Horses&quot;<BR>&quot;You Gotta Move&quot;
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Wow!  After I saw this movie it left me kinda numb but I couldnt wait to watch it again!  This is in itself a great movie!  I personally think that this movie is much better than Pi although dont get me wrong Pi was a very good movie too.  Darren Aronofsky is a great director.  I love all of his techniques that he uses such as the shot in front of the actors face while they walk/run and the camera just moves with them.  Its great.  And I have always said that 30% of any movie is the soundtrack and this one had a great soundtrack.  I personally think that this movie should be shown in health classess in high schools.  I love the message that it sends.  Overall all great movie!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This was an incredible show!  I saw it on Broadway in NYC, and fell in love with the music.  The chords are good, and I like the &quot;bounciness&quot; the music has.  I would highly recommend buying this CD.  Kristin is awesome!
B000002H33|5.0|This is Metallica's best album by far.  It was their last with Cliff Burton, and their second to last great album.  This album isn't just mindless metal either.  Hetfield writes amazing lyrics that deal with the problems in society.  The best parts though are the solos played at 1000 miles per hour.  Also there are no filler songs, the weakest trak would probably be &quot;Thing That Should Not Be&quot;.  The best tracks are of course &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, and the horribly underated &quot;Damage Inc.&quot;  Others like &quot;Welcome Home(Sanitrium)&quot; and &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot; are amazing as well.  I miss the Metallica of the 80's with crazy fast rhythms, amazing solo's and songs that meant something.  Unlike the Metallica now(Sellouts) with mindless rock songs, slow tempo's, and NO SOLO's WTF?????  Cliff would be ashamed, and I know he is rolling over in his grave as we speak.  Anyway, buy this album you won't regret it.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Something about this CD feels like they just recorded it to make a quick buck.  It doesn't seem to have the feeling and dedication as the previous 2.  I really wanted this album to be good.  I was very much let down.  The songs obviously were thrown together-like the band was forced to make this album under duress.
B0001FR3IQ|1.0|This movie sux.  It has a very poor plot, it starts out slow, it is predictable, the acting is pure ass, and it definately isn't scary.  Halle Berry(2002 Oscar Winner) has just ruined her carrer, and Penelope Cruz can't act at all.  This movie is an insult to horror movies, and I know I am 'NOT ALONE' in thinking that.  The best part of this movie was the Limp Bizkit song at the end, that is how sad this movie is.  Limp Bizkit sux, but Gothika sucks 100 times more.
0156012197|3.0|The Little Prince is a book full of wonders.  It brings out the real thoughts of things you wouldn't really think about.  After reading this book, I was a little perplexed by what all of the authors figurative language meant, but after a long time of thinking I understood what it was all about.  It is about love and friendship and thinking deeply about or for something or someone.  There was one sentence that really came out of the book and caught my attention.  It was \\"What is essential, must be seen with the heart\\".  This really made me think about how true it is.  There are so many feelings and emotions that are only seen with the heart.  And one of them is love.  It is the most essential emotion of all.  That is why I think the main themes in this book are love and friendship.  I have learned a lot from this book as well.  One main thing that I have learned is how to identify figurative language.  It might be confusing at first, but after you understand, you feel really good about your self.  If you want a very good book to read, don't choose this one, but if you are a figurative kind of person, then this is the book for you.
078681859X|5.0|I read this book when I was 16, and I have to admit that I loved it. I am an avid book reader and despite the recomended age group being 9-12, I thought it was rather clever and witty. The character Nathanial is a tad annoying and whiny, but the character of Bartimaeus was extremely interesting and fun. I could not put this book down, as it was so captivating. I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys stories filled with magic and adventure, and I can not wait till the 2nd book comes out.
B00000JCOV|1.0|I think that mucically the group is talanted but I think they should try to send a more positive message to the young kids of today. So many kids listen to this junk and it twists their minds. Makes kids depressed and suicidal. I know my daughter has not been the same since she has started listening to this junk. She is dark and depressed and becoming a very hateful person. I can only assume that none of the band members have children and if they do I hope they don't have to go thru what I am because of these negative messages thru song!
B00003CWTI|1.0|Wow. Where do I start. Usually I don't go and buy movies \\"blind\\", but I figured with a cast like Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, Jason Robards, et al, plus with all of the awards listed on the back of the box, sure why not? I'll give it a shot. What a pile of $#!&%*. Here's a summary in one brief description: Imagine Pulp Fiction - but the stories don't come together at any point in the movie. The intro to the movie was about freak occurances that are so way out there that they have to be more than coincidence. Seemed very intruiging. Three hours of screwed up people leading screwed up lives, and no common thread to be found anywhere. This was like six storylines that rode off into the sunset in different directions never to be seen again. I loved \\"Pulp Fiction\\". I loved \\"Two Days In The Valley\\". They were fragmented movies that came together at the end and were very entertaining. This movie was straight crap. Maybe you have to be artsy-fartsy to appreciate it, but let's get real here - raining FU&#%NG frogs??!! The geek who directed that should get a job, or at the very least a more meaningful hobby (like playing with his bellybutton). This movie absolutely blew!
B000268QB2|4.0|I am a big fan of Coldplay and while seeking out similar bands, I discovered Keane and I am glad that I did. The piano-led music of this UK-based band is powerfully melodic, not to mention the gorgeous voice of the lead singer Tom Chaplin, which is one of the highlights of their music. A great first release for this band, can't wait till they tour the US in June!
B000002KFJ|4.0|This album, along with &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; are the best offerings from this legendary band.  There isn't a dull moment on this disc.  They were exploring new grounds at the time, and came up with a winner.  Eveybody wins here, the band, the record company, and especially the fans.  Black Sabbath is the best hard rock band of all time, and great albums like this one and &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; are the proof.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I don't even own this CD yet, but I have listened to the player on the Muse website ([...]) several times and I am completely enchanted. Their sound is a combination of sweeping orchestrals, powerful lyrics, grinding guitars and, last but not least, catchy hooks. I had not heard about them until a friend recently recommended and I have definitely become a fan. If you like Coldplay or Radiohead, check out Muse and I'm sure you'll be impressed and hooked after the first listen.
B000002KKS|1.0|This is truly Black Sabbath at their worst.  Ronnie James is a horrible singer.  He also has an ego that really got in the way during his years with Sabbath, ultimately leading to his being dismissed.  &quot;Look at me, I'm the new Ozzy!&quot;  &quot;I'm the god of heavy metal, worship me!&quot;  Gimme a break, Ronnie.  The lyrics to some of these songs here(written by RJD)are so juvinile, so pathetic, you would think a fourteen year old child on his first acid trip wrote them.  Sure, Tony's guitar playing shines as usual, but it doesn't rescue this awful album from the infestation of that rat Dio.  Not recommended.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknots one of the top five bands of all time! They have amazing, original music and the best vocalist I've ever heard! <BR>The negitive reviews it gets are from people that like totally different music. If you only like one type of metal then this band is probably not for you. But if you like good metal no matter what sub-genre it is, You'll love the Knot!<br />PS: Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit SUCK!
B000002L61|1.0|Friends, I'm here to tell you that this is awful, simply horrible music.  His voice is dreadful.  I'd rather listen to a dog barking all night long then to sit through this dreary dullsfest.  Who listens to this anymore anyway, '80s metal just has zero appeal to me and most of my friends, we all used to like this, but something so silly is easy to outgrow.  The only '80s metal that still hold up is Slayer, and even when Dio was popular, his best (except for the first &quot;Blackmore's Rainbow&quot; album) is not as good as Slayer's worst.  And that includes his days in Black Sabbath, no wonder Tony Iommi kicked him out, compared to Ozzy, he made Sabbath look and sound silly.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is a really good cd however, it doenst sound anything like slipknots older music. The closest song to their original sound is Duality. Non the less, this album is awesome!
B000089RVX|1.0|The recording industry wants you to believe that this is what's happening, this is what is quality music.  Fortunately for me, I don't buy in to all that nonsense.  This is a horrible band, and all the songs I've heard were just rotten.  As far as listenability goes, I give this one a big fat zero.
B000002MIF|5.0|Is it just me, or does this band band have WAY TOO MANY &quot;Best Of&quot; compilations?? The versions of many of the Smith's best known songs are here presented in (  for the most part ) alternate versions, a few Peel sessions ( where they sound heavier, meatier, more lean'n'mean as a Band than on some of their frankly  anemic  and fey studio recordings) , and  a 12&quot; single or two. This is what brought my attention to the Smiths back in the eighties. I had the album on import, as it was available only in that form for years, until I found the cd in the Virgin mega-store. I still listen to it. Very Highly Recommended. Better, in my opinion, than any single Smiths album or any of the compilations.
B000002L7V|1.0|This disc showcases Ronnie James' ego.  &quot;King of Rock and Roll?&quot;  Is this song about Elvis?  This is one of the worst recordings of all time.  You know, I was 19 when this came out, and, I must admit, I was a Dio fan (I used a lot of drugs back then) but when this came out, my buddy bought it and we both hated it.  We tried to get into it, but we just found it to be boring and tiresome.  We didn't even go to the Dio concert that year, we were just so let down.
6302508878|5.0|This movie never fails to please because it is just basically good story telling, a solid buildup for the first 40 or so minutes and then action that never lets up and never lets you catch a breath untill the end. Some of the dialogue hasn't aged too well: &quot;Gee,... I guess I love you&quot; makes me cringe every time, and does anybody say &quot;swell&quot; anymore? &quot;These seats cost me twenty bucks!&quot; is a hoot and I use this movie as proof positive that it's not just Canadians who say &quot;eh?&quot; at the end of their sentences. (By the way, I didn't catch Alberta-born Fay Wray saying it but Cabot and Armstrong did a couple of times.) <br />I am looking forward to the DVD release this year but my 60th anniversary VHS copy is okay for now. It's missing the spider scene and the questionable dialogue and the film source has a bit of artifacts but I find that the transfer to video tape is done a lot better than a lot of my newer movies on VHS.<br />I find that Fay Wray's acting is probably the best of any actor in this movie and it's a shame her career did not grow beyond this movie. All things considered this creature feature is not one to be missed. Long live Fay Wray!
B00006ZXSK|5.0|It is a great movie that you will not regret purchasing. Adds a extremely realistic twist to the cinderella story
1400032717|1.0|This may be the worst book I have read this year. It is not a fun read; the writing is blunt and dull and there is no interesting use of language and no plot to speak of. Oh, and the &quot;mystery&quot; is resolved in the middle of the book and followed by another 70 pages of exremely tedious explanation of a trip to London.<br />&quot;But that's not fair,&quot; you say, &quot;the protagonist suffers from autism. Of course the book would be written in simple language!&quot; Maybe this is an accurate portrayal of what would happen if an autistic person wrote a book. I would say that it is not; Haddon just takes every stereotypical trait of an autistic person and assigns them to the protagonist.<br />If you want to read a crime/mystery novel written from the perspective of a person with a disability, read Jonathan Lethem's book &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; (the protagonist has Tourette's syndrome). Lethem's book is a clever and witty book; in this book, the disability is a device designed to give the book some humor and color.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Under my Skin is probably the best CD i have in my cd case right now. Since i've gotten it i have compared it to her previous cd and found that alot of the songs are darker part two's to her songs on Let Go. I hope the below will help you people out.<br />1. Take Me Away &gt;&gt; 9/10 &gt;&gt; Sounds like Unwanted pt. 2<BR>2. Together &gt;&gt;10/10 &gt;&gt; One of the best songs on the album. Losing Grip pt. 2<BR>3. Don't Tell Me &gt;&gt; 8/10 &gt;&gt; It's a good song if you don't have the CD. But when you compare it to the other songs it sounds a bit weak.<BR>4. He Wasn't &gt;&gt; 6/10 &gt;&gt; My least favourite track. It gets boring after a while. Complicated pt. 2<BR>5. How Does It Feel? &gt;&gt; 9/10 &gt;&gt; A nice ballad. Tomorrow pt. 2.<BR>6. My Happy Ending &gt;&gt; 9/10 &gt;&gt; This is a really good song with an intersting chorus. Sk8er Boi pt. 2<BR>7. Nobody's Home &gt;&gt; 9/10 &gt;&gt; Another slow-ish song. I'm With You pt. 2<BR>8. Forgotten &gt;&gt; 10/10 &gt;&gt; Best song on the album. The riffs in this song are..amazing, vocals too. I'd be shocked if she didn't put this as a single. Unwanted pt. 2<BR>9. Who Knows &gt;&gt; 8/10 &gt;&gt; Its an O.K song.<BR>10. Fall to Pieces &gt;&gt; 8/10 &gt;&gt; It's a great song, but somethings missing. Naked pt. 2<BR>11. Freak Out &gt;&gt; 10/10 &gt;&gt; My second favourite song on the album, about being free and letting go. <BR>12. Slipped Away &gt;&gt; 9/10 &gt;&gt; About the death of her grandfather, the best ballad on the album.<br />My fave tracks on the album are:<BR>1 ) Forgotten<BR>2 ) Freak Out<BR>3 ) Together<BR>4 ) Slipped Away

630025111X|5.0|Based on the western classic by Jack Schaefer, MONTE WALSH is a sad, poignant tale about Schaefer's view of a vanishing lifestyle and the last American Cowboy.<br /><br />Now to the inevitable arguments and comparisons that have arisen, given the remake that was recently produced. This original 1970 version of the film, as opposed to the very likeable and viewable new Tom Selleck version, brings with it some striking differences.<br /><br />In the first place there's just no one else like Lee Marvin and his immortal portrayal of Monte Walsh.  Yes, Selleck does a marvelous job in the remake but the hard, chiseled features that made Marvin a western legend are difficult to upstage.  Marvin not only delivers the hard edge that all have come to expect from the cowboy stereotype, he also shows an amazingly soft side that comes through in spades throughout the film. And that voice!<br /><br />Secondly, there's just no one else like Jack Palance.  While Selleck did a good job of holding his own, when compared to Marvin, I came away liking Palance's wonderful portrayal of Monte's trail partner, Chet, far better than that of Keith Carradine in the remake. Palance pulls off the likeable and agreeable Chet but maintains a tough side that is all his own.  And like Marvin the striking silhouette and the gravelly voice create a believability that was lacking in the Carradine portrayal.<br /><br />Next there's Martine. Jeanne Moreau portrays the perfect Martine with her infrequent but sad smile.  It literally lights up the screen and then vanishes as Martine, a prairie prostitute, inevitably contemplates the harsh realities of her existence.  The hollow, sad eyes are beautiful and yet leave you with a sense of pain that would surely have been characteristic. The sad chemistry that emerges between Moreau and Marvin is nothing short of magical, leaving the viewer to sense and weigh the pain and the fleeting happiness that exists between them. Isabella Rosellini's portrayal of Martine in the remake is just too perky.<br /><br />The film also features a grainy, old-feeling, almost sepia patina that was characteristic of other western films of the time like BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, BIG JAKE and MAN IN THE WILDERNESS.  Add to that the wonderful soundtrack by John Barry (OUT OF AFRICA, MIDNIGHT COWBOY, CHAPLIN and THE LION IN WINTER) and the haunting strains of Mama Cass singing \\"The Good Times Are Comin',\\" the theme from Monte Walsh, and you have a western classic that has been much neglected and should not be missed.<br /><br />As Monte rides off into the sunset, telling his horse a story about a wolf-wrastling compadre, one realizes that Chet's observation in the film that \\"nobody gets to be a cowboy forever...\\" is dead wrong--especially for Monte Walsh!  Here's hoping he keeps riding forever.<br /><br />And now on DVD!<br /><br />THE HORSEMANperky.

B000021YQV|4.0|System of a Down's sophomore album is criticized as being a terrorist album because it came out on 9/11...and because the band members are from a middle eastern nation originally.<br />I'm not surprised, but dissappointed by these racist rants.  For one, Armenia is near the middle east but is a Christian nation, not Islamic. For another, even if they were Islamic, it doesnt make them terrorist. What is a terrorist anyway? Christian nations who take over entire nations, exploit resources, destroy cultures, enslave humans, and enforce Christianity? The governments involvement in Iraq is a terrorist act in itself. The events of 9/11 have no connection with Iraq besides stupid Americans who group all of the Middle East and its inhabitants as one collective. There is no hope for this sad country which continues embracing racism even in music, the only thing good in this corrupt world.
B00007E8V4|4.0|This band borrows heavy from Rage Against the Machine as many have noted, but even more so they borrow from the legendary band, Bad Brains. Both bands are better than SOAD, but SOAD are still good.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|After listening to this album just twice I don't think that's enough to give this an in depth review.  There is just so much music here that it takes a long time for it all to sink in.  My first impressions are that this is the most impressive &amp; cohesive album since the Brave\Afraid of Sunlight era.  There is an unbelievable return to form here &amp; ambience that I never thought the band would be able to re-capture again after being disappointed with recent releases.  No disrespect intended but I am surprised that the guy from NY gave this 1 star &amp; completely slated it, I'm usually really critical of music - perhaps too much - but this to me is nothing short of a masterpiece.  With reference to H's strained voice on The Invisible Man, it's obviously completely intentional &amp; just adds to the feeling of desperation as the song draws to it's climax, let's face it - if they wanted they could have cleaned it up with voice correction software but that's how it was meant to sound &amp; adds to the effect of the song.   With regards to H's lyrics, well they work for me - I know he has a different style to John Helmer but they are filled with emotion &amp; very personal &amp; fit the music perfectly - there are certainly a few spine tingling moments for me.  I know everyone's opinion is different but I just think this deserves to be listened to a number of times before writing it off, after all it took two &amp; a half years to make &amp; you can't really fail to notice the dedication to detail on this.  Personally I think this will in time be one of the albums I regard as a classic along with Brave.  A beautiful, magical masterpiece of an album - 5 stars.
B00003CXCT|2.0|The product look the same to me, apart from the 30% less they charge on amazon.co.uk, and the region coding of the dvd (to make sure north americans can't play europeans dvds on their machines).
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I have listened to the CD three times so far..including twice on MTV.com.  However, I went out and bought the CD today because I'm an Avril fan and love her music and lyrics.<BR>This CD seems to have more of a rock tone to it than her first one. However, the Alanis style still shines through.  I can see at least 3-4 songs becoming at least top 1-20 songs, and possibly two of those being major hits<br />I am still trying to figure which is my favorite song, but I am perhaps leaning toward her last song on the album called &quot;Slipped Away&quot; which is about a lost love.<br />I really like &quot;Take Me Away&quot;as its rock tone reminds me of the intensity displayed in &quot;Losing Grip&quot;.  Ironically, they are both the first songs on their respective albums.<br />&quot;Freak Out&quot; has a unique sound to it that will get a lot of radio play just for the poppish sound it has, but yet it is still unique like I said.<br />&quot;Who Knows&quot; is also a cool song. <br />My Happy Ending is good intense song...very catchy.<br />I also really like &quot;FAll to Pieces&quot; which is about holding on to someone for the very last minute, before they are gone for good....at least that is how it makes me feel.
B000148KK2|2.0|I own all of Diana Krall's albums and have enjoyed watching her career soar.  Usually the songs she sings show off her piano skills, her vocal phrasing, and her emotive abilities. This one, however, really does fall flat. The songs are forgettable - there's not one you'd find yourself humming later or belting out in the shower.  Instead, they are slow and without any decisive melody.  Listening to it the other night, I thought, &quot;This sounds like a second-tier nightclub singer.&quot;  I think poor song selection is the real culprit. To this day, my favorite Diana Krall album remains &quot;All for You&quot;, a collection of Nat King Cole tunes. Buy that one if you want to hear the real jazz that Diana Krall is capable of.
B00005JKC3|4.0|I liked it.<br />I must note that it does not rank on par with some of the truly great superhero movies that have been filmed in recent years.  It is certainly not on par with Sam Raimi's &quot;Spiderman&quot; or Tim Burton's &quot;Batman&quot;, but then, the Hulk has never had the following or commercial popularity of these other characters.  <br />Much credit should be given to Ang Lee, whose vision of this well-known, (if never fully conceived) character remains truly to his own directoral style.  Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), son of David Banner (one of many &quot;tips of the hat&quot; to the original television series), grows up without his real parents, raised instead in a foster home.  Ambitious and bright, he pursues a career in advanced science, attempting to develop a new &quot;nano-technology&quot; that will enable people to rapidly heal.  Aided by Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), all seems to be going along fine until a mechanical malfunction results in Bruce's exposure to gama radiation.  This exposure unleashes the Hulk, whose presence in his body has been there since before his birth, when his father (Nick Nolte) performed an experiment on himself and inadvertantly passed his genetically enhanced and altered DNA onto his son.  Now unleashed, Bruce Banner becomes consumed by the anger and rage of the parents that abandoned himand thegovernment that would use him as a weapon.<br />And, as Bruce admonishes, &quot;Don't make me angry...you wouldn't like me when I'm angry...&quot;<br />For it is through his anger that he is transformed.  Ang Lee's monster, far more massive even than Lou Ferrigno's Hulk of the T.V. series, was created using some of the most advanced CGI to date.  The transformations between Bana and CGI are seemless, and, unlike so many CGI characters, the Hulk is convincingly real, with a degree of authenticity that really goes beyond most of what has been seen on the screen so far.<br />There are, of course, weaknesses in this story.  Some canbe forgiven, though personally, it felt as though Ang Lee spent too much time on exposition and character development, and not enough time on the culmination of his characters and their conflict.  (NOTE: SPOLIER AHEAD)  In the final showdown in the film, David Banner has transformed himself into a monster by exposing himself to the same gama radiation as his son.  His metamorphosis enables him to capture the energy and strength of whatever he touches, transforming himself into whatever he is in contact with.  As he confronts his son, the battle between the two rages, and suddenly, and with no obvious or appearant reason, his father is defeated.  An explination is given (won't ruin this for viewers), but it left me going, &quot;huh?&quot;<br />In many ways, Lee's depiction of Bruce Banner is a Jekyll/Hyde character, and audiences would feel sympathetic to his plight, were it not for the very dry and unemotional portrayal of this character by Eric Bana.  I am not familiar with any of his other films, but in this particular offering, his performance is dry, without emotion.  Jennifer Connelly, on the other hand, is immensely believable as Betty, whose loyalty and tormented love of Bruce is balanced against her contempt for her father, a high ranking officer chiefly responsible for the torment of both David and Bruce Banner.<br />Perhaps most dis-satisfying about the film was Lee's way of using small windows in the screen to tell portray the film as a series of vignettes placed together to resemble the layout of a comic book.  The idea is clever, and at moments, really works in this film, but for most of it, it is more distracting than anything, making it ever so much more difficult to follow the film.<br />Those criticisms aside, this is still a well developed movie, and far better than some of the other recent superhero fare (Daredevil as one such example).  Rated PG-13 for moments of action style violence and some unsettling images, this is a film that is best suited for slightly older audiences, both for the forementioned reasons, and the level of complexity built into the story.<br />For avid fans of the comic book or the television series, look for both Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno at the beginning of the film in a brief cameo.  <br />DVD extras are okay, designed more for the comic book fan than any serious film junkies.  <br />-Scott Kolecki
B00020HEG6|4.0|Are you a John Williams fan?  If you can name more than twenty of his scores, then the answer to that question is yes, and you should just go ahead and buy this CD, if you haven't already.<br />For the rest of you, I highly recommend the CD.  It doesn't rank as one of Williams's very best scores -- that's hard to do -- but it IS a consistently inventive and engaging work that finds Williams taking his Harry Potter music in new directions of intensity and emotional gravity.  I imagine it's going to sound great in the movie, for which I cannot wait.<br />These are the best tracks: &quot;The Knight Bus,&quot; which sounds like a crazy mix of the Cantina Band music from &quot;Star Wars&quot; and the jazzy theme for Christopher Walken's character from &quot;Catch Me If You Can,&quot; and is a wonderfully spry piece from a Hollywood veteran; &quot;Buckbeak's Flight,&quot; which proves again that Williams seems to be particularly inspired when writing music to represent flight; &quot;A Window to the Past,&quot; a gorgeously gentle piece that represents Harry's despair over never having known his parents; &quot;Double Trouble,&quot; an excellent song that is also the major new theme of this movie, instrumental versions of which pop up here and there throughout the score; and &quot;Mischief Managed,&quot; a suite of the various new themes that, I imagine, will play over the end credits.  Those are merely the high points; pretty much every track is good to one extent or another.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|When I started reading the reviews for Vol 3 here on Amazon, I didn't even have a clue that Corey was the vocalist of Stone Sour, and never had I thought that this cd and Stone Sour sounded alike. Then I went and listened to Stone Sour's whole cd, and realized, they don't sound alike (an opinion of mine). The slow parts of Vol 3 are completely different, the hard parts are much harder and more metalish than Stone Sour ever sounds, and Stone Sour seems more like just another everyday rock band you hear on the radio. So enough of Stone Sour, Slipknot is back in full force, the cd is heavy and has 4 songs that are completely slow songs, which I like all of em in addition to the HEAVY songs. THe best songs would have to be &quot;Vermillion&quot; and &quot;The Nameless&quot;. &quot;Duality&quot; is a good song, but for it's own reason and it is an obvious choice for their first single, I can only hope they pick something heavier for their next single, like &quot;Before I Forget&quot;. If you like Slipknot, pick up this cd. If you are expecting a Stone Sour sound, you WILL be disappointed.
B00020HEG6|4.0|Incorporating children's choirs, jazz, renaissance chamber music, and ballet-like tracks, this is one of the most eclectic film soundtracks you will ever hear.  It's quite a change from the traditional sounding scores of the other two Harry Potter films, but it's change that I think will work for the story.<br />Alfonso Cuaron writes in the booklet, &quot;John juggled these medieval motifs with a late 19th century rossini-esque, a delirious big band Jazz number, and 20th century music.  How he managed to create a unity out of it all, beats me!&quot;<br />But all these styles do to come together to give a wider view of the Harry Potter universe.  Fans of the former soundtracks will no-doubt enjoy this one as well and movie soundtrack afficianados will find much to marvel at.  The subtle choir used in &quot;The Potronus Light&quot; reminds me of A.I.  The mournful &quot;A Window To The Past&quot; utilizes recorders to great effect.<br />This is an enhanced CD which includes an exclusive screensaver (not very good),  one wallpaper and an extensive slideshow.
B000002OTL|5.0|The soundtrack to Quentin Tarantino's breakthrough movie Pulp Fiction is arguably one of the best soundtrack albums you'll ever hear. Like Tarantino's other movie soundtracks like Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill, it combines a few great songs that were past hits with tracks that most music listeners have never heard before. Unlike those soundtracks, Pulp Fiction is great from beginning to end with the more obscure tracks being arguably better than the more established songs.<br />All of the tracks here that were past hits are very strong. Kool & The Gang's \\"Jungle Boogie\\" is one of the best funk jams from the '70s. Al Green's \\"Let's Stay Together\\" is '70s soul at its best. Chuck Berry's \\"You Never Can Tell\\", Dusty Springfield's \\"Son Of A Preacher Man\\", Ricky Nelson's \\"Lonesome Town\\", and the Statler Brothers' \\"Flowers On The Wall\\" with its catchy chorus are also great tracks. Any movie soundtrack containing these tracks would be pretty good. But what really puts this album over the top are the more obscure tracks or \\"deep cuts.\\" Dick Dale's \\"Misirlou\\" is a killer track that resurrected the surf guitar king's career. Urge Overkill's version of Neil Diamond's \\"Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon\\" is an outstanding track which is even better than the original. The tracks \\"Bustin' Surfboards\\" and \\"Surf Rider\\" are also great. But it's the somber acoustic track \\"If Love Is A Red Dress\\" with Maria McKee's fantastic vocal performace and whistling hook that steals the show. The snippets from the movie are  some of its best moments, especially \\"Royale With Cheese\\" and Samuel Jackson's closing \\"Ezekiel 25:17.\\" The tracks are also sequenced very well, never putting songs from the same genre or mood together. All told, this is a great soundtrack to what was arguably one of the best movies of the '90s. Highly recommended.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye West is mainly a producer and not a rapper. But I do like his style. Its refreshing to see/hear a rapper talking about subjects that most rappers don't even rap about. I also have to give him a &quot;BIG UPS&quot; for the track &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; (again another example of him not following the rapper's mode).I also find his songs and skits quite witty. And unlike my other favorite producer Timbaland, Kanye has interesting ways of saying things. My only complaint is he samples too much. And from what I hear, he really doesn't need to. I think in the future, he should focus more on his songwriting and producing because that's where he really shines. But I am glad he made this cd. It needed to be done.
B00009TB5G|1.0|I have bought two of these at Wal-mart and neither one of them has appendices that will play. The problem is, Wal-mart will not give me my money back-only replacements. How may times will I have to return this piece of worthless junk? Am I the only one who's had this problem?
B00005A46T|1.0|this is possibly the worst album of all time complete and utter crap im listening to bands like morbid angel who are class but these guys ???? the first album was quite good with spit it out catchy good tune this has none of that sounds like these muppets are playing pots and pans rather than drums stay well away from these sounds because it aint music
B000069HZP|4.0|This was a great movie with an excellent story to go with it. It's too bad the dvd shares the same fate of others with weak features and no behind the scenes or commentary. This is one dvd that deserves an overhaul like the one that panic room received.
B0000296SI|5.0|Blink-182 is the best band out there, and this is their best CD. Here's how I rate their songs.<br />Dumpweed: 10/10 Awesome Lead Off Song<br />Don't Leave: 7/10 Worst Song On CD<br />Aliens Exist: 9/10 Love The Music In The Middle Of The Song<br />Going 2 College: 9/10: Another Awesome Song<br />What's My Age Again: 8/10 Would have been better if Tom sang it<br />Dysentary Gary: 10/10 Ending Kicks Ass<br />Adam's Song: 10/10 Great song to follow up a total punk song like Dysentary Gary<br />All The Small Things: 8/10 Got Old after awhile<br />Party Song: 10/10 Fast Paced Song, but Just As Good as the others<br />Mutt: 10/10 Hey, it was used in American Pie!<br />Wendy Clear: 8/10 Decent Song<br />Anthem: 10/10 It Compares to M&amp;M's on Cheshire Cat, just flat out awesome
B0001XALTG|5.0|It's about time miramax went back and re-released this dvd. The first edition was as plain as a bologne sandwich with no extras. Definetly buy this new director's cut version for your collection!!
B0001NBMBC|3.0|Vol. 3 sounds like metal Stone Sour...not like Slipknot.  This is a good CD, but a huge disappointment if you were expecting an awesome follow up to Slipknot (self-titled) and Iowa.  They are heading in a totally different direction and it definately sounds like they are trying to be very radio friendly with a few tracks on Vol. 3...let the trendy pop BS and &quot;c&quot;rap stay on the radio, I would rather listen to anything I want on CD anyway.  A few of the tracks sound like they are going backwards to the days before their self-titled album (if you've never heard any of their really old songs...i'll just put it this way- these songs have never been released on an album because the album would bomb).  <br />Slipknot is one of my favorite bands, but after waiting two years for a killer follow up to Iowa...I end up buying a follow up to the Stone Sour CD.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Sellout? I don't think Slipknot is selling out because this is most likely their final album. An album that nearly never saw the light of day. The self titled Slipknot was great back when it was released, but their second, Iowa, was nothing new. Iowa was boring and might as well have been a re-release of their self titled cd. A lot of fans felt this way and I believe Slipknot themselves realized it. The band nearly broke up after Iowa and it took a stay at Rick Rubin's mansion to bring them back together. Back together to dig Slipknot up out of the grave it was put in after Iowa.<BR> Slipknot proves that they are not a one track band with Vol. 3 and it is too bad that this is probably their last album. They decided to finally take off their masks and show the world who the real Slipknot is.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril is very keen on shedding that &quot;pop&quot; persona that many people classify her in, and it's evident on this, her sophomore albun.  Whereas many of the songs of her first album were definite pop songs (all I loved), this CD sounds much more &quot;punk&quot;.  Still, most of the songs have hooks and catchy tunes which is what I like in music.  I definitely recommend the CD if you aren't too concerned with labels like pop and punk and just like music.  If you are concerned about true &quot;punk&quot;, you might be disappointed.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This is their best album.  It must be owned by all rock fans.  This disc smokes from start to finish and is in my top five.  Very highly recommended.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This has to be the smartest thing George Lucas has done for a long time. From some of the reviews I have read though, you'd think the world was ending. I noticed a lot of negative reviews, about \\"the trilogy is disgraced because of the new additional scenes\\". Well, like a true Star Wars fan, I do not feel this way at all. I think the added footage, and all the other improvements were excellent ways to bring the films into the 21st century. The originals were great too, but they were in bad need of repair before they released the Special Editions. <BR>All in all, I just want to say to all those negative reviewers, if you don't like it, just get over it, and get a life. Oh and by the way, the ewoks rule. They might be cute and cuddly, but you have to admit, they can battle.
B000000OMB|5.0|Thanks to MTV, the 1980s became a black hole music-wise. Whether a band could actually play became irrelevant. It was more important to have a freakish haircut or to be a cross-dresser. Video had killed the radio star as The Buggles song said.<br />Ironically, one of the Buggles, Geoff Downes, joined with Carl Palmer (ELP), Steve Howe (Yes) and most importantly, John Wetton (King Crimson/ UK) to form Asia, a group that didn't rely on shock value or gimmicks. They just played great music. How revolutionary! <br />For fatuous prog-fans, Asia was like garlic to Count Dracula. If Downes, Howe, Palmer and Wetton were involved, the album MUST have twelve-minute songs about wizards and spaceships, right? WRONG! Asia showed a certain maturity and featured lyrics about more personal and down-to-earth issues. The players were in their thirties, after all -the age at which it's hard to sing about &quot;mountains that come out of the sky and uh, stand there&quot; with a straight face. The progsters had grown up.<br />What many people forget is that while the musicians of Asia had strong prog backgrounds, John Wetton and Geoff Downes (the two main songwriters) had very strong pop credentials, too. Downes was with The Buggles, Wetton was with Roxy Music. Asia's music shows a perfect combination of catchy hooks and intricate musicianship. No prog album before or since produced more hit songs and no pop act had such astounding musical skill.<br />The songs are simply amazing. The best (Only Time Will Tell) is a classic and the weakest (One Step Closer) is still a good song. Unlike other &quot;supergroups&quot; where the music seems shoehorned together the music of Asia blends naturally. Carl Palmer's drums do more than keep time. His solo on Wildest Dreams is concise and explosive. Steve Howe's guitar is perfect on solos and background, Geoff Downes' keyboards range from triumphant to melancholy -in the same song! John Wetton's bass is simply the best and his voice seems almost custom-designed to echo in concrete stadiums. It's that strong, but is just as good in quieter moments on Without You.<br />When Asia left the scene, a lot of musical integrity went with them. The music for the rest of the 1980s (with a few exceptions) went from bad to Prince -or worse. This album is a sort of time capsule from that period when music mattered more than lipstick.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|After 3 years of waiting, Slipknot comes up with a very melodical, yet heavy, album that's an instant classic for every Maggot out there that cares about Slipknot's music, and not about how many times Corey uses cuss words in a song. <BR> In my opinion, Slipknot has found the balance between melodical Metal and heavy Nu-Metal. With great-sounding guitar solos from both James Root and Mick Thompson in almost every song (except the acoustic songs such as Circle) they step their music up to a whole new level which shows the maturity of the band after their first two albums.<BR> I was astounded by the fact that this album is not \\"Parental Advisory\\" at first, but then I realized that cussing is not necessary to make the music more intense. It's the melody and heaviness that makes you bang your head and fall in love with this Album. It's simultaneously (...) Beautiful\\" and \\"Brutal\\" as Corey Taylor said in one of the interviews. I highly recommend this album to the true Maggots who love the 'Knot for their Music.<br />My Personal Favorite songs on this album are \\"Opium of the People\\" and \\"Duality\\".<br /> (...)

I have read a lot of reviews here that say this isn't funny. <br />All i have to say to that is PEOPLE Booed Jimmy Hendrix off the stage too (that didnt make him any less brilliant either). If you have a sense of humor don't waste time BUY THIS DVD!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|As Avril progesses she has developed somewhat of a new sound.  The songs are deeper, less polished, and are somewhat of a &quot;heavier&quot; nature.  She sings differently on this album than on Let Go.  However fans of Let Go won't be disappointed with this release as Avril remains true to all that made her wonderful to begin with.  A clear voice, fast-melodic songs, deeper lyrics, and a truely different sound that music has been missing for quite some time.  A young girl with something to say, a spirit, and the feelings that lie under her skin.
0671027387|3.0|Dan Brown hit it big with The Da Vinci Code. He had already used the characters in that book once before in Angels & Demons. Now when I say he used the characters, I mean not only was Robert Langdon in both stories, but the female lead, the endearing father figure, the megalomaniacal villain, the unstoppable killer, and the militant police officer were in both stories. Now, true, the names for everyone but Robert Langdon were changed. But they were the same characters.<br />On top of that, I think that Angels & Demons is a far superior story to The Da Vinci Code. So when I downloaded and began reading Deception Point, Brown's third novel, I was afraid that the same characters would be present. I still suspected this having gotten all the way through the first dozen chapters or so. None of the characters had been developed very well at that point and even though the apparent main character was female instead of male, the same kind of details existed around her. She did an obscure job, had a phobia, and got thrown into a situation that she felt completely foreign in.<br />Howver, what I discovered as I read was that of his latter three books, Deception Point is definitely Brown's best work. (I have yet to read Digital Fortress, his very first novel.) Brown didn't focus on just one character for the story to revolve around, he had two: Rachel Sexton (the action sequences star) and Gabrielle Ashe (the intrigue sequences star).<br />The story is that of a presidential election and a massive NASA discovery - a meteorite that contained fossilized extraterrestials! Great stuff. The action sequences included icebergs, submarines, black helicopters, UFOs, and Hammerhead sharks! The intrigue sequences included terrorism, illegal campaign financing, massive governmental cover-ups, and the naturally exciting field of presidential politics.<br />When I think about either of the Illuminati novels, I can think of six main characters. When I think of this novel, there are at least 10 main characters and I know I'm missing some. In a complete reversal of normal literary critique, Brown seems to be a better storyteller when he doesn't focus on developing characters. It truly is the weakest part of his craft (if you don't count the ham-fisted romantic relationships he tries to write).<br />In the end, I knew three-quarters of the way through who the real megalomaniacal mastermind was. And it was then that I started recognizing a few of the set pieces that Brown is using over and over. For lack of a better term, he has schticks. And he's used them in all three novels of his that I've read. See if you can find them.<br />Overall, this book was worth the time if you're a Dan Brown fan. It read quickly in parts but slowly in others and sometimes the twists were telegraphed a mile away. If I were asked I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys popcorn movies.0 main characters and I know I'm missing some.

0312995423|1.0|This is only my opinion, but I have trouble calling this a thriller. It certainly is no longer cutting edge (published in 1998), but that's not the author's fault. The rest of it is. For the first 200 pages, the action moves forward with all the speed of a dead horse. You aren't sure what the point is, and you don't care. What the action lacks in thrills, it makes up for in melodrama. There was one endless scene where the pretty heroine-crytographer is pulled back and forth between two men that is reminiscent of that old silent serial (Perils of Pauline? for you movie history buffs). The dialogue is ghastly and the  description is nonsensical. His jet black eyes were like coal? She was conservatively dressed in plaid pants? What was the author thinking? There is a whole lot of disgusting stuff we don't need to know, like a detailed description of the hero's several visits to a filthy public restroom. Finally, if a character is speaking a language other than English, the author should be sure to get it right. I can't tell you about the Spanish, but the German was pretty bad. I'm not paying full price for the DaVinci Code after this.
B000148KK2|4.0|Did you know that Diana Krall is married to Elvis Costello? I so didn't know that. But I heard it on NPR, so you know its got to be true.<br />Anyway, ever since I heard Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas I fell in love with Diana Krall's voice. It's one of those voices that just sends chills up my spine. Why do deep voices do that to me? No idea...but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy it!<br />This is the first album by Krall with any original material on it. And that material is some good stuff. There's also a couple Tom Waits cover as well as a cover of one of her husband's songs. And from everything I've read and heard, this is supposedly Krall's most pop oriented album to date.<br />Now while I won't take issue with that statement, it seems ridiculous to think that Krall set out to make niche music in the past. In fact, what she did make was music that had a built in audience. Popular songs from times past for current listeners. Now, Jazz Vocals are not everyone's cup of tea, but then there are plenty of people who can't stand Hip Hop. But taking a look at the Billboard's Top Ten Album chart just this week four of the top ten albums are Hip Hop. (Coincidentally, this album is ranked #5. Not bad for someone who heretofore didn't make popular music.)<br />No admittedly, with the lack of standards on this album, the trademark of Krall isn't present. But her take on Waits' Temptation is just greatness. For whatever reason I've Changed My Address just struck me as one of the most melancholy songs I've heard as an adult. And you can never really go wrong with a Joni Mitchell song can you? Black Crow is simply a great rendition of a Mitchell classic.<br />Overall, I would recommend this album to anyone who likes music for music's sake. If you're looking for a message from your music, there are a few here for you. If you're looking for inspiration, there's Krall's voice if nothing else. And if you just feel like listening to a beautiful female voice, then you certainly can't go wrong.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I bought this CD a few days ago with God Forbid and I love it.  I am so glad that I bought this.  It is so worth the money.  I have spent almost $600 on CDs in the past few months and this is one of the few that were really worth it.  If you like heavy metal, get this.  You won't regret it.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|All I can say is &quot;Wow&quot;. I bought this CD this morning, very excited because I've been waiting for Under My Skin for a number of monthes. Being a huge Avril Lavigne fan, I have to say this CD is awesome. Unlike Let Go, her debut album, UMS is punk rock and deep. Every song could be a hit. Buy this CD because it's completely different from her first album, if you liked Let Go, then you'll love Under My Skin. If you hated Let Go, then you'll love Under My Skin. Obviously this girl has been working hard for a year to make a unique, catchy CD full of meaningful songs that kick major a$$!!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I had been waiting for what seemed like forever after Iowa for this CD to come out.  So I finally bought it the day it came out on May 25th.  I can't say that I was disappointed, but this sounds closer to a heavier Stone Sour than Slipknot.  I like it a little better than Stone Sour.  I like it about the same as Iowa.  Iowa was good, but nowhere near the major label debut.  Don't get me wrong, this is a step in the opposite direction that Iowa was.  This is nothing like anything Slipknot has ever done.  I bet they will lose at least half of their fans over this, but I don't regret buying this.  I do like this cd, and I do like Slipknot; I was just kind of surprised because I saw them live a month ago and did not hear anything like this.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes Slipknot or especially Stone Sour, as long as they are open-minded and realize that Slipknot have indeed changed.  Duality is a great song by the way (I know I will catch hell for saying that).
B0001DI0FI|4.0|MOVIE: This film is about the story of Captain Jack Aubrey and his crew on the HMS Surprise. The film takes place during the times of the Napoleonic Wars at sea. What makes this film a winner is the fact that it was able to stay incredibly historically accurate and still maintain is entertaining value. Most movies that try to be historically accurate tend to fail miserable due to them being . . . well . . . boring! Take Gods and Generals for example. Anyway, the film documents the adventures and journeys of this ship as it fights for their country and themselves. I guess what made this movie so exciting was the incredible sound and visuals. At $150 million, the movie was no cheap fare to make. Unfortunately it did horribly at the box office and was the reason that the movie was split between three different distributors (20th Century Fox, Universal, and Miramax). What really makes this film so enjoyable is the fact that it has such a fantastic ensemble cast. As you've expected, Russell Crowe is the star of the show, but without the supporting cast his performance would have gone to waste. A terrific film, one of the best of its kind, and something that you can take with you to history class and to your home theater.<br />VIDEO: The video of this DVD is incredible. Your HDTV will certainly get its run for the money, mine sure did. This two disc set comes in anamorphic widescreen in a 2.40:1 ratio.<br />AUDIO: Here you get an amazing DTS and Dolby 5.1 mix that will knock your socks off. The sound of this movie is incredible and needs mixes like these.<br />PACKAGING / EXTRAS: I have the two disc edition. I personally feel that the only reason why we have the choice of one disc and two disc editions is because of the poor performance at the box office. So in order to get as much money as they could, they put two discs in a fancy shmancy box and charge a lot for it. Then they give the option of a disc with absolutely nothing on it so buyers of the two disc set feel special. Honestly the extras are nothing to bananas over. It's not a great amount and they are not all that special. In this set you get trailers and tv spots, 70 minute behind the scenes documentary, how they adapted the movie from the books, moviemaking secrets, sound design featurette, cannon demonstration, 6 deleted scenes, multi angle scenes, and a split scene vignette. When someone buys something they always want it to be the better of its kind. So knowing how the human mind works, Fox released a bare bones release and a normal two disc set wrapped all pretty and slapped a big price tag for that. Naturally the consumer will buy the better set. I don't see why the consumer has to suffer just because their marketing failed during the theatrical release. The set is good though, I'm just complaining about how they released it and priced it, that's all.<br />Movie Score: (4 Stars / 5 Stars)<br />DVD Score: (8 / 10)ial.

B00006L83N|5.0|Odyssey(2003). Symphony X's seventh studio album.<br />Through the 90s, several bands have paved the way for progressive metal, such as Dream Theater, Queensryche, Fates Warning, and others. However, one band which was influenced by hard-hitting heavy metal and classical song stylings would eventually meet up to the standards set by these aformentioned bands. They were known as Symphony X. Comprised of vocalist Russ Allen, guitarist Michael Romeo, bassist Michael Lepond, drummer Jason Rullo, and keyboardist Michael Pinnella, Symphony X is armed with exceptional songwriting capabilities and they are very talented as well. If Dream Theater wasn't the most well known progressive metal band around, then Symphony X certainly would be. Russ Allen has one of the best voices in all of heavy metal music, and I'd go so far as to place him with some of the more famous vocalists, such as Bruce Dickinson and Geoff Tate. Michael Romeo is one hell of a riff-shredder, and I'm glad to hear that he managed to make Guitar World's Top 100 greatest guitarists list. The thing I like best about Symphony X is while they generally don't stray very far from Awake-era Dream Theater's general style, they do fuse it with their own unique energy, creating very memorable music. Also of note is the fact that they employ fantasy/medieval themes into their albums. While a lot of power metal bands like Hammerfall and Rhapsody tend to go overboard on the themes, Symphony X is more like Kamelot, pulling it off in a way that isn't cheezy. In fact, they can be described much like that band: fast and heavy enough to appeal to power metal fans, but just technical enough in their playing ability to set themselves apart from that genre.<br />Odyssey would be the band's seventh studio album, and as of writing this review, their latest one as well. From what I understand, the band was opting for more of a refined heavy metal sound with this release, meaning that the music relies less on the keyboards and the guitars are more upfront. Indeed, the guitar tone is cleaner, yet more aggressive than it has been. Nevertheless, the keyboards still play a big role in every song, especially the massive title track. This was the first Symphony X album I ever bought, though I still noticed a slight difference from previous albums. So does Odyssey live up to the band's other two masterpiece albums Divine Wings Of Tragedy(1997) and V(2000)? Let's find out:<br />The album starts off with the scorching opener 'Inferno' followed by two faster, yet equally impressive 'Wicked' and 'Incantations of the Apprentice'. Both 'Inferno' and 'IotA' feature some stellar guitar work, while 'Wicked' sports some outstanding vocals. 'Awakenings' and 'Accolade II' are both slower rockers, almost balladic in quality, though they are still as progressive as the rest of them. The latter is a worthy continuation of 'Accolade' from Divine Wings, though most fans already know this. 'King Of Terrors' is probably the album's heaviest track, while 'Turning' is the fastest song and one of my favorites. While all these tracks are good, the best one of all is of course the epic title track, based on Homer's The Odyssey story. It clocks in at around 24 minutes, but it manages to stay very interesting throughout the entire thing. Many could say that this song represents the band at their all-time best. The keyboards and symphonies greatly help the song, and each part is played EXACTLY the way you would visualize what was happening in the story. This shows some of the best musicianship I've heard anywhere. The epic especially hits a high point in the catchy closing section 'Champion Of Ithica'. There is also the bonus track 'Masquerade' which shows much more usage of the classically-inspired keyboards, though it does break into an excellent rocker which no one should skip.<br />So if you like your heavy metal to be complex, showcasing good songwriting, infused with classical influences, and played with talent, then youshouldn't be disappointed at all with Odyssey. It clearly lives up to the previous outings and adds in a heavier guitar sound for them, so I see no reason not to give this five stars. Symphony X, though bearing similarities to Dream Theater, is clearly not just another DT clone, and I can see them continuing to make great music in the future. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br />Other recommendations:<BR>-'V: Mythology Suite' by Symphony X<BR>-'Epica' by Kamelot<BR>-'Awake' by Dream Theater<BR>-'Recreation Day' by Evergrey
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Regardless of whether or not you like Avril personally, everyone should give &quot;Under My Skin&quot; a listen! As a former Avril hater, I understand why a lot of people won't give her a chance - but don't let that get in the way of listening to this great album. Here is a song-by-song review and rating of &quot;Under My Skin&quot; -<br />Take Me Away ~ Incredible track! Probably the heaviest rock vibe on the album, but Avril pulls it off surpringly well. Good song to listen to to if you're in a bad mood. Awesome chorus. [5/5]<br />Together ~ Great song, not much to say about it, though. [4/5]<br />Don't Tell Me ~ The album's first single and probably the closest you'll hear to her old &quot;Let Go&quot; sound. A really great song, but probably not the best first single choice. [4.5/5]<br />He Wasn't ~ &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; with an edge. [3.5/5]<br />How Does It Feel ~ Mellow song, but awesome, although a bit repetetive. [3.5/5]<br />My Happy Ending ~ The album's second single - an oustanding track! This probably should have been her first single. Very catchy chorus. [5/5]<br />Nobody's Home ~ Second best ballad on the album. It may not have the pop-ish sparkle of &quot;I'm With You,&quot; but I think the message is even better. Great song. [4.5/5]<br />Forgotten ~ Starts out really eerie and then works its way into a rock-driven chorus. Took a few listens, but now I really love this song. [4/5]<br />Who Knows ~ Filler track, but still good. [3/5]<br />Fall To Pieces ~ I'm not sure why, but I really love this song. A song that most people can relate to. [5/5]<br />Freak Out ~ Good song. No other comment. [3.5/5]<br />Slipped Away ~ Best ballad on the album. Very meaningful song, as Avril wrote it about the death of her grandfather. Very powerful. [5/5]
B00005M91K|5.0|i saw this about 6 years ago and i can still feel exactly how i felt when if first saw it.  that is how profound of an effect it has.  this should be mandatory viewing!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Once again I'm astounded by Pirates of the Caribbean. The music is wonderful to listen to and helps make the movie even more enjoyable. I would recommend this CD to anyone. Bravo Klaus Badelt and bring us more!
B000092Q7O|5.0|The depiction of the brutality of the Nazis toward the Jewish population of Poland is heartbreaking and unforgettable. This film captures the range of emotions that a family experience as they subjected to the gradual increase in persecution that ultimately leads to Treblinka.<br />Adrien Brody is a marvelous actor and is perfectly cast as  Spilmann the famous pianist who is the only member of his family to survive. Spilmann's Survival depends on the kindnes of others who take great risks to protect him. Thes heroic acts are contrasted with the forementioned brutality of Germans to great effect in the film. A final act of redemptive kindness by a german officer near the end of the war brings the absurdity of the circumstances we have just witnessed into full relief.<br />Based on Spillman's memoirs , the film is very accurate relative to the book. The cinematography is astounding, particularly the transformation of Warsaw to a spectoral ruin where Spillman struggles to survive. The movie is well acted, well written and shocking in it's realism.<br />IT will leave you numb if you haven't seen it yet.
B000268QB2|5.0|At last, we get to hear a great album almost at the same time it was released overseas. Despite all the blind comparisons blurted out to make Keane sound like Coldplay wannabes, this is certainly a record that stands on its own.<BR>Like most of the three-way bands nowadays, the strenght lies in Tom Chaplin's incredibly high voice. The lyrics are not massively new or even slightly cryptic, if we want to go back to comparing them to other british bands, but they speak out honesty and simplicity, which makes the songs easy to relate to.<BR>Opening track &quot;Somewhere only we know&quot; is already a semi-classic for the year, while &quot;This is the last time&quot; sounds like one of those forgotten campfire melodies we left behind years ago. &quot;Everybody's changing&quot;, the current single and a personal favorite, marks the invisible half of the record with such harmonious pace that is is impossible to resist Tim Rice's opening chords. The tempo goes down a notch with &quot;Your eyes open&quot; and &quot;She has no time&quot;, but comes back to the cheerful tone with the radio friendly &quot;Can't stop now&quot;. &quot;Untitled 1&quot; diverts the sound slightly to a more spacey direction, where drummer Richard Hughes successfully directs traffic, followed by omnipresent keyboard lines. If we want to designate that key track in Hopes &amp; fears, the one that resumes the whole feeling of it, without a doubt we have to mention the anthemic &quot;Bedshaped&quot;, destined to be the best single off the record and a gig favorite in no time. It would be cynical to ignore all the obvious influences we can find in Keane's first album, but why dimish its quality based on that? Music is never 100% original, it is made of different pieces from already created beauty, glued together to form a new, sometimes better vision of a worldly delight. Well deserved five stars for Hopes &amp; Fears, and many more to come.
0743243315|4.0|The Strength of the Human Heart: Book Review of Brick Lane by Monica Ali, Scribner, 2003<br />This runaway British bestseller details the live of Nazeen,  young Bengali woman transported to London as an arranged marriage nuptial. <br />Nazeen makes this book happen. She leads a host of supporting characters through daily life in their little slice of London life. Fleshing out the ranks behind her are:  Razia, over-weight and self-absorbed;  Chanu, the over-bearing bumpkin of a husband; Shahana, the shin-kicking teenage daughter, the brat whose neck you want to wring; Bibi, the loving, adoring and eager-to-please younger daughter; Hasina, the letter writing sister, and anchoring voice from her former home, Dhaka, Bengladesh; Ms. Islam, the stingy, hypochondriacal loanshark; Dr. Azad the learned doctor and unloved husband; Karim, the morally-upright,  yet lustful, responsible yet irresponsible, handsome, virile, and available lover ...the list goes on. These characters spring to life in all of their various stages of non-linear, unpredictable complexity. <br />Through Nazeen's life, the reader gains access into London's Brick Lane where Bengalees has been transported. They are immigrants seeking the &quot;better life&quot;. Their arrival is accompanied by cultural confusion and breakdown of traditional values. Their families are bombarded with drugs and other vicissitudes but in the end they learn the new ways, integrate new values into their lives and transform their identities.<br />As readers, we learn about the rural Bengaldesh of Nazeen's memory. She frequently returns to the land of her childhood, in dreams in  fantasies, and in recollections, in her desire for things known. We are also shown the modern state of Bengaladesh as Chanu delivers sermons to his captive daughters and wife. We are driven into an English-Bengali life to then look out at white English people. Nazeen's unassuming anxiety about cultural clues gave me, a non-Bengali reader, insight into myown culture and cultural assumptions without having to travel to another land. It is unlikely that, even if I travelled to London or Dhaka, that I would have been privy to this life.<br />&quot;But they were not aware of her. In the next instant she knew it. They could not see her any more than she could see God. They knew that she existed (just as she knew that He existed) but unless she did something, waved a gun, halted the traffic, they would not see her. She enjoyed this thought. She began to scrutinize. She stared at the long, thin faces, the pointy chins. The women had strange hair. It puffed up around their heads, pumped up like a snake's hood. They pressed their lips together and narrowed their eyes as though they were angry at something they had heard, or at the wind for messing their hair.&quot;<br />Our heroine is a woman that doesn't seem to know herself, just loves whom she loves, goes where she is sent, cooks what is expected that she cook. She changes, sometimes slowly, unassumingly and sometimes, rapidly and unexpectedly. She comes alive in her indecision, in her faith, in her lust, and in her confusion. <br />&quot;Nazeen could not concentrate on her sewing. She watched the back of Karim's head, the strong lines his neck made. If she were to describe him to Hasina, what would she say?<BR>That even when you knew you had not, you could end up believing you had said something that might change his life....She would say that he knew so many things. ...Chanu also knew many things but they only left him bewildered. If knowledge was food then while Karim grew strong on his intake, Chanu become only bloated, bilious, and pained. The made Karim made you feel was...&quot;<br />She struggles with her faith, she is flawed, she has doen peculiar, idiosyncratic. For example, she has passed many hours in the night, standing at the kitchen counter eating, after her family is in bed; a thinking/non-thinking.&quot;For her, there was nothing else to be done. Nothingelse that God wanted her to do. Sometimes she wanted to get up and run. Most of the time she did not want to run, but neither did she want to sit still. How difficult it was, this business of sitting still. But there was nothing really to complain of. There was Chanu, who was kind and never beat her. There was Raqib. And there was this shapeless, nameless thing that crawled across her shoulders and nested in her hair and poisoned her lungs, that made her both restless and listless.&quot;<br />This life goes-on-type of story lends strength to the human heart through the perseverance of the characters while holding the readers attention with like a  spicy, aromatic, well-prepared dinner that will keep you reading through the night. The ending left me with the feeling of having gained more understanding about what it is to be human.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|By far musically,this is the best they have ever been.If you were expecting more headbashing music,you guessed wrong.With two acoustic tracks,you can tell stone sour bleeded into slipknot. Not all songs are that bad...there are some skipover tracks,but there are some pretty kick ass songs on hear. The one thing that i liked about the cd is songs SOLO's in some of the songs. Band today don't really do that anymore,so why not? slipknot musicially has grown...and the cd will sell well,but their first cd is still the better of the 3...this is worth picking up,but get it in the first week,so it is cheaper
B0001NBMBC|4.0|ok, here's the thing, i approached buying this album because at first i heard 'pulse of the maggots' and i was disappointed, primarily because of corey's &quot;new&quot; vocal style throwing me off.  hearing 'duality' enough got it growing on me and being a slipknot fan since early on, i broke down and bought it.  enough of the life story here's me attempt at review: this album i can best describe as being a combination of the first two releases, with a new side they shed in a number of tracks, there are some songs which sound like iowa and some that sound like the self-titled album with more expanse on the musicianship, which has become very tight from listening to the album.  the only reason i wouldnt give this five stars is because of three reasons: a)you really have to be a longtime, dedicated slipknot fan to truly listen through this cd enough to let it all grow on you and you then begin to hear it's real highlights (i only bought it yesterday and i've been listening to it all night) b)some songs either should've been sorted differently or just not put on the album, simply because the flow hinders a bit when you go from a really hevay song to an ambient acoustic-industrial song and then into thrash, there's nothing wrong with the variety, because the band does it in a style which works for them and still sounds good, the order is just jumbled, c) i don't know if the album was mixed in different studios but the drums are weak sounding on a few tracks, which is not to say joey's performance is crud, he does some amazing stuff on this album (which should be an assumption anyways), it's just that the way the kit was mixed sometimes comes out sounding like the ass drum was a piece of cardboard.  In finality, this was a very pleasing and refreshing listen and for slipknot fans, i'd say buying it wouldn't be a question, simply because it holds it's own as a damn good third release.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE CD'S AS I GOT TO HEAR 27 FANTASTIC SONGS FOR THE PRICE OF A SINGLE CD.ALL THE HITS LIKE I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND,MICHELLE,NORWEGIAN WOOD, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT FEATURE IN THIS SUPERB CD.VERY VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.A MUST HAVE.
B0000035E7|5.0|The debut album of the greatest band of all time, what can we say about it, not the best Nirvana album, but it will do. My favorite song out of this album is &quot;About a girl&quot; and &quot;School&quot;. This album cast the first original members of Nirvana, Kurt Cobain on guitar and vocals, Chris Noveselic on bass, Chad Channing on drums, and Jason Everman on gutair. This album didn't go as strong as Nevermind, but it told a great Fu%$ you to the public. Nirvana was paid $606.17 to do this album, and it was well worth it I bet. In the end of the song \\"School\\" Kurt just keeps screaming No recess, which is what I relate to in a great way. <br />Bleach is the most growing up album out of them all. The lyrics in these songs are of Cobain's early child life. In this album Kurt's lyric technique is less than fully developed, but it is still a lovable album. Bleach when into a great introduction to the world, Nirvana knew how to sell it. This isn't my favorite Nirvana album, but it is a great album for sub-pop. It is the grungiest Nirvana album of them all. Go back to your roots and buy this album. You won't regret it, it is worth every penny. Ten years without Kurt Cobain, we need to cherish the moments he was around.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Yeah, I know what most of you are thinking. 'Avril is just another little brat in the long line of punk-rock posers'. While yeah, she may not be punk, i wish the so-called 'purists' would just shut up and give credit where credit is due. I don't put much stock in the general music stereotypes, so I'll listen to just about anything and give it a chance. The songs on Avrils latest release didn't come as much of a suprise. Think 'Let Go' with a harder-grungier edge. There's bits of just about everything in this one. &quot;Happy Ending&quot; throws back to her last album and even sounds a bit like Hilary Duff, but with that 'avril' touch. By far my favorite song on the album is 'Fall to Pieces', possibly because it talks about issues that I've experienced recently. Overall, her sound has matured a little, probably with the help of co-writer Chantal Kreviazuk (probably best known for providing a song on the Dawsons Creek Soundtrack). The bottom line is, the songs on this album are GOOD. If you take all your punk stereotyping and throw it aside, you will love this album. Who cares what she's trying to be? Don't pay any attention to all those reviewers who keep giving this album 1 star simply because they feel offended that she's trying to be 'one of them'. Honestly, what is punk these days anyway? Let them have their identity crisis while you go out and buy this album. Its worth it.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|The first Beatle album since the release of &quot;Help!&quot; that has over 10 good songs in a row on it. Rubber Soul fell short as did Revolver.  Sgt. Pepper and Mystery Tour didn't come close.  The White Album - couldn't do it even with 30 tracks.  Abbey Road, nope.  Let It Be, falls short because of Across the Universe.<br />This is a good CD though, because for $13.99 you get 14 great songs on the first half, then a few good ones on the second half that you have to skip around to get to.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This CD is totally worth the small price.  I have to say that I think it's much better then Let Go was.  The songs are absolutly genius and her voice is beautiful.  Go get this CD or you'll be lost.
B0000AQVCL|2.0|I don't like it because the songs they write are most of all copied and it's really  a wast that they don't write an album on they're own.
0451450523|5.0|She is the last of the Unicorns. For centuries, she has lived within her forest, at one with nature and her surroundings. Immortal, she has been unconcerned with the fate of the other Unicorns, for surely, if they were all gone, she would know of it? But it is not the case. Feeling curiosity and doubt for the first time in many years, she sets off to find out what has happened to the other Unicorns, why humans don't even seem to see her, and just what the mysterious Red Bull is.<br />Beagle writes beautifully. Metaphors and similes are used with ease, and almost without exception they evoke images of verdant forest, shimmering lakes or crashing seas. Nature is a well-used tool for poetic license, and fits the theme and setting of the book perfectly.<br />Along the way, she meets the bumbling magician Schmendrick after being captured by a dark, evil witch, then Molly Grue next befriends her. Together the trio explore the land, venturing deep into the mean King Haggard's domain in search of the Red Bull.<br />Characters are either very black or very white. The Unicorn, we are told, is the most perfect, beautiful creature of all, and this lofty description is met and matched and every opportunity. We believe that she is perfect because her actions are perfect and the words to describe her are perfect. There is a sense of great sadness when she walks through a human town and is considered to be only a white mare, she cannot understand how the villagers seem unable to even see her horn.<br />There are mis-steps along the way, but not many. Some of the dialogue between humans is too anachronistic for my liking, and the opening to the second part of the novel in Haggard's castle dragged a little bit. A few too-clever modern day references were made as well, but really, all of these are minor. The writing is beautiful, capable of evoking sadness and joy, and the characters are a lot of fun to be around. The ending, while tidy, was expected almost from the start and is thussatisfying.<br />On a last note, the butterfly near the start was probably my favourite part of the whole novel, what a great character!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is clearly the best music slipknot has ever written. I've been waiting for this cd for a long time and it's finally out and its so great. I even skipped school on the 25th to go buy it. Sure they sound so different from the other two albums but it's a really great sound and theres 3 acoustic songs which are great. Slipknot was my fav band but then they took a break so Metallica became my fav band but after hearing this album slipknot is back on top and I can't wait to see them live. Call them sell outs if you want but its still slipknot and its really different and GREAT!!!
6304696515|5.0|Some reviewers spoke of the poor dvd quality.  I was too young to see this film in the theaters when it came out, but is it possible that it could have been made to look like that?  Sometimes a special filter is used on the camera to give the picture a specific look.  I thought the haziness and soft, pastel colors presented in the movie mirrored the rococo style of the period perfectly.<br />This is my favorite John Malkovich movie.  His looks are irrelevent to his portrayal of the Viccomte.  Malkovich completely embodied the sinister and seductive Valmont, and every time I watch this film, I fall under his spell, too.
0345363132|5.0|This is a fascinating story! I am quickly becoming a big fan of Penman's books and the people of this time in history. The hardest part of the book was keeping all of the characters straight since names were commonly reused and the characters usually had two names and a title. I can't wait to read more of her books!
B0001NBMBC|1.0|It's mindblowing that a band partially responsible for revitalizing metal at a time the genre needed it most has resorted to &quot;beautiful melodies&quot; and &quot;seamless acoustic interludes&quot;.  This album is a disjointed mess, and an overly-produced disjointed mess at that.  Every distorted guitar riff sounds candy-coated, there's no consistency between songs, and what little &quot;creepiness&quot; they tried to capture is almost instantly ruined by silly electronic video game sounds, discrediting any validity they claim to have left.  Most of this stuff, as stated above, belongs on a Stone Sour album, some don't belong on an album at all.  If only they could have burned out, instead of faded away...
B0001NBMBC|5.0|OMG THIIS IS NOT SLIPLKNOT! HOW CAN U DO THIS!!!!!111oneoneone YOU SOOLD OUT!!!<br />Okay, kid. Chill out. Take a walk, watch some television, something. Because I'm going to talk about how excellent this recent offering from Slipknot is and I'd hate for you to try to comprehend growth and horizon-expansion.<br />Actually, plenty of people have already talked up the virtues of this album. So, I guess I'll just answer the negativity.<br />1) They Sold Out!<br />Indeed they did! Most likely your local neighborhood record store and theaters across the country!<br />2) This is NOT Slipknot!<br />Well, unless Corey, Shawn and company snapped and murdered eachother and Roadrunner, in a desperate move smacking of paranoia placed stand-ins under the masks, I really hate to break this to you -- it's Slipknot. Don't like it? Then go listen to the first two releases, you adolescent, hip noise-addict scenester, you!<br />3) It sounds like Stone Stour!<br />Let's see. Corey Taylor. Check. James Root. Check. Hey, there's the main nucleus from Stone Sour, I'll be damned! I always wondered why the vocalist from both bands sounded strangely similar! <br />4) It's radio-friendly and has almost no swearing!<br />Well, yeah. Having kids and other big life changes tends to alter your perceptions of life. It's also difficult to feed/clothe said kids with no promotion of the product.<br />Anyhow, there it is. Take it or leave it, I'm sure it doesn't matter in the long run. Slipknot loves it, most of the fans love it and I'm sure a few obnoxious aggression addict teenagers boycotting it won't affect things in the long run.<br />This album's gonna be tough to follow, boys. Bravo.
B00009V7RF|5.0|The model ur talkin about is Stacy Ferguson. Shes actually not a model, shes a singer. She does not lipsync...ever....she sings all her vocals live. She was in a group Wild orchid for a long time and they sang all the vocals live too...so stop assuming that she doesnt sing. shes been in this business for 20 years ever since she was 9.<br />i really think people are dissin on the beps because a white girl is in the group now. all the other beps cds everyone loved. but all of a sudden, a girl with a powerful voice with a beautiful face shows up in the group. then everyone hates the album. this is really wrong and everyone who thinks this should not go by skin but by talent. fergie is amazing. the beps thought she was too. thats why shes in the group now. they loved her.<br />BUY THIS ALBUM.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Let's be frank; before this, Slipknot was rather one note. But they played that note to perfection. They were the hardest and rawest rockers on the scene, plus they were aided by their masks, and formed a cult following. After their amazing (but one note) first album, they released the inferior &quot;Iowa&quot;. Ambituous, but it failed to deliver what it needed to. So like many others, I was very skeptical of this new turn Slipknot was taking with Vol 3. <br />Man am I suprised. This is clearly Slipknot's best effort. They described it as their Led Zeppelin IV, and they were correct. From the range of the tracks to the pure feeling of &quot;Wow, I can't believe they just pulled this off&quot; Slipknot does not dissapoint.<br />As said, they show more range on this record than the last two combined. From the rough and raw tracks such as &quot;The Blister Exists&quot; and the punk rock/metal combination exhibited in &quot;The Opium of the People&quot; to the melodic tracks of &quot;Danger Keep Away&quot; and &quot;Vermillion Pt. II&quot;, to the best song on the record &quot;The Nameless&quot; which manages to come off as both a hardcore rock track and a melodic, meaningful scream of love and sorrow, Slipknot definately shows growth. The only real bad track on the record is &quot;The Virus of Life&quot;. It comes off as a more experimental track and fails at what it sets out to do. That is my only real dissapointment with the record.<br />Many fans will be put off by this record simply because they won't open their mind to new things. Slipknot is growing musically and lyrically and it is very obvious through &quot;Vol. 3&quot;. If you open your mind and expect something new, then this will be your favorite Slipknot record. This is the first album of theirs that I can truly call a masterpiece.
B00009V7RF|5.0|GREAT ALBUM! HAS TO BE THE BEST RELEASED ALBUM EVER. <br />BUT...<br />WHY ORDER THIS OLD VERSION WHEN THE RE-RELEASE WITH THE NBA ALL STAR SONG &quot;LETS GET IT STARTED&quot; WILL BE ADDED ON. WAIT UNTIL THE RE-RELEASE TO BUY IT SO YOU GET ALL THE GREAT SONGS TOGETHER. THE RELEASE DATE WILL BE JUNE 5TH. IF THATS NOT THE DATE, ITS SOMETIME IN EARLY JUNE.
0743454529|5.0|There's only one word to describe this book. EXCELLENT! I had never heard of Jodi Picoult before three weeks ago when we walked into Barnes and Noble and 50 copies of this book stared me in the face. She has been elevated to my favorite author (I have since read her book 'Plain Truth').'My Sister's Keeper' is thought-provoking, and Ms. Picoult has a gift for weaving a scene in which you feel you are right there. I love the way she oscillates from first to third-person story telling and also the way she tells this story from every main charater's perspective. The end was so surprising. I sobbed. It was a little abrupt but still an unexpected twist. Thanks, Jodi, for a great read and for highlighting the struggle that many families face when dealing with a sick family member.
0671027344|5.0|PERKS is such an outstanding novel. After THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez (which another reviewer recommended), it's the best novel I've read in at least a year! It transcends what is typical and expected for books about awkward teenagers and reaches deeper into the meaning of self discovery. As I read the book, I was finding myself more intrigued by Charlie, the narrator, because he reminds me so much of myself. He's the type of kid that seems so ordinary but has such an extraordinary mind. Charlie is so likeable and anybody can relate to him. He has this unique and rare thought process that is simplistic yet reaches high levels of intrigue and complexity. All the events, both happy and sad, that occur are things that happen to everyday people. Readers can empathize with Charlie and understand Chbosky's tone about the struggles of being a teenager. This is one of the most readable books I've come across and I think teenagers would thoroughly enjoy it, so I highly recommend it.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|First off I am a Slipknot fan from the get go. I loved the self titled album. I think the band really lost themselves with Iowa. It was probably right at the time, but a bit too harsh and angry. This album, Vol. 3, is totally amazing. Heavy bands always take a bunch of crap from stupid metal heads when they try to grow and try new things, like Metallica with the Black album. Anyway, lyrically this album is way more thought out than the previous two. There is not one profane word on this whole album! That alone blew me away, it shows true growth in the band. Even though there are a couple of mellow songs on the album, the sound can't in anyway be compared to Stone Sour. Each song has that signature Slipknot feel, kinda eerie, kinda strange. Corey's vocals are truly amazing, his trademark shrieks of pure anger are still here, as well as his melodic singing voice. The guitarists try new things on this record instead of the constant thrashing. Joey is still amazing on drums, the double bass action is super fulfilling. I think any true Slipknot fan will love this new record, again its a step in the right direction.
B0001CCXY8|1.0|okay. so it is humourous for the first few minutes. but the gore lyrics are very cheesy and .... i mean... come on. cant we be the least bit artistic? there is so much more death metal out there with meaningful and artistic songs, where they spend much time crafting their songs with techinical and lyrical skill. this is &quot;blasting&quot; at its worst. basically we have here, a group of immature men who can play fast *ooh im impressed* . but not technical. im not saying there is no skill. but there is a low amount of skill combined here. create something artistic, create something meaningful, not this &quot;cheesy-scary-look-at-us-we-are-evil&quot; noise. grow up.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Short and Sweet: Best disc I've heard in years. Been a maggot for a while and proud to be one still.<br />Long but Lean: Let me grab a soapbox for a second to address some of the other reviews first. Then I'll get to the meat. I'm not sure what the beef is with the other reviewers. I understand the propensity to compare and contrast a band's new album with their previous efforts, but to rate it solely on such weak a scale leaves me nonplussed. Listen to the album. Think around the corners of the ruts Slipknot made in the music scene over the last few years. Question: does this album rock? By God, it does. And often. Another question: does this album show growth? Their musicality on Vol. 3 is second to none. The boys can bang a guitar, beat a drum and belt lyrics with the best of them. On Vol. 3, they do it better here than ever. If you want the past, it's there. If you want something new, Slipknot's got the best thing going. This is hardly Slipknot's St. Anger, so give it a shot.<br />Soapbox away. Time for a little stream of consciousness reviewing.<br />Each album has an intensive hard rocker on it. This one's is \\"The Nameless.\\" Caution: ears may bleed.<br />#8's vocals are more melodic here, but isn't that different than most metal bands these days? And for those dabbling in harmonies, isn't his voice superior?<br />There are acoustic guitars here as well. I got no problem with that. Slipknot playing blues I might have an issue with, but they don't do that here. Slipknot playing blues...okay, I'd buy it.<br />Curious about the lack of swearing. But, I've got plenty of examples in their first three efforts if I forget what it sounds like.<br />In short, this ain't your daddy's Slipknot. And that ain't necessarily a bad thing.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|This was a so-so romance comedy. It is certainly not my favorite genre. I have liked many of Jack Nicholson's movies, but my wife has not (excepting &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot;, which Nicholson shows a lot of the same acting in this movie). Nothing great, nothing bad, very predictable, everyone is well-mannered, etc. Just too blah for me.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Wow! What a lovely album filled with beautiful compositions. This is a very mature album, full of insight and emotion. I can relate to the song &quot;Slipped Away&quot;, for my Grandmother passed almost a year ago and there is not a single day that goes by that I do not miss her and hope that she hears me. I also love how Avril collaborated with Chantel and Raine Maida. This is an absolutely stunning album! Go out and buy it right now - you will not regret it.
B000000H5K|2.0|I bought Chaos A.D. and loved it. Loved the whole album and every song in it. Thats what I think makes a great CD is the quality of each songs regardless of lyrics. After listening through the album over about four times it isn't too bad. Some songs really stand out while others don't. Dictatorshit does not fit in this CD, even though its awesome. Its more thrash style. I would recommend buying this if you want a different experience with listening to Sepultura.
B000089RVX|5.0|Well, I'll keep this short and sweet. How disillusioned I've become with the music industry over the past ten years, to the point when I hardly listened to anything any more! All my kids are into Eminem, Puff Daddy and the like these days, and I have to put up with the endless swearing and filth these talentless oiks keep dishing out. Then came Evanescence, they write their own songs, play their own instruments, and they have something very rare in the music industry these days... yes, talent! Amy's voice is amazing, so haunting and powerful, and coupled with good metal riffs and gothic undertones, I think they are the best band to emerge in years!
0446677450|5.0|I have read six of Kiyosaki's books now.  People should understand that his goal is not to tell us something new, or that we didn't know, but to CLARIFY what we should be doing, organize the ideas and show us HOW to open the umbrella under the rain (taxes / paychecks) and stay drier than the majority of citizens.<br />He is not an investment revolutionary of any kind, but sometimes until someone can put into different words what we already know, we don't tend to pay attention and go along taking the course of least resistence (i.e. - the rat race).<br />I STRONGLY RECOMMEND READING THIS BOOK AND KEEPING AN OPEN MIND.  This book is the introductory to the series.  The OTHER Rich Dad books DO go into detail on specific subjects, plus they CLARIFY and demonstrate MUCH MORE of the what if's.
B00009RGBS|2.0|Imagine a musical that glorifies men who kill their wives. That has scenes of men in prison talking about how they shot, stabbed, or poisoned their wives and how the wives deserved it! That glorifies slimebag attorneys who defend these men and who have \\"never lost a case\\".<br />Such a musical wouldn't have a snowball's chance in hell of being produced today, if ever. Everything associated with such a production would be subjected to massive boycotts and PR campaigns by womens' groups, and would be stopped dead in its tracks. In fact, pre-censorship would prevail and the project would never seriously be considered.<br />Coincidentally, I borrowed this DVD from my local library while I was reading the chapter in Warren Farrell's terrific book, \\"The Myth of Male Power - Why Men are the Disposable Sex\\" that discusses how women receive much more lenient sentences for committing the same crimes as men.<br />The media is literally saturated with anti-male propaganda that women would never tolerate. This film is just one example. Most men are where women were in the 1950s, in terms of their consciousness of their own oppression and of how in so many ways they literally are \\"the disposable sex\\". I've been radicalized, and I'm not staying silent any longer.
B00020HEG6|5.0|As much as I love what Mr. Williams has done for the world of orchestral music in the past few decades, I've felt of late that he, like too many in the world of film scoring, have fallen into an unbreakable pattern of turning out a lot of music that is in and of itself good, but not anything more than that extra something that films need to spice things up a bit for the audience.  While no one doubts that Williams is a masterful composer, I really feel that in many of his recent scores, so much of his talent was being wasted on a formula (i.e. thick orchestration, sweeping melodies, chirping woodwinds) that becomes sonic wallpaper even when taken out of the film and put into our CD players.  Audiences now have become so used to this sound that we almost wouldn't notice if it wasn't there.<br />So, while I usually don't endeavor into movie scores until after actually viewing the film (I think it's kind of unfair to pass judgement when I don't know the context in which it was written), I was so intrigued by claims in early reviews of a completely revamped HP soundtrack that I couldn't stand the wait.<br />Let me just say that with this score, Williams has completely restored my faith in his ability to catch our attention and really do something daring with his talent.  While some fans might be a bit deterred by the nearly complete lack of any thematic material found in either of the other two films, I find that the change is extremely refreshing.  Williams has also stumbled upon new ground that I hope he continues to tread for some time: small, intimate chamber sounds as opposed to the full orchestral glory that has become his trademark.  The two tracks that sold me on this score are: <br />1) &quot;A Window to the Past,&quot; which aside from being a hauntingly mournful piece, introduces a rich, colorful instrumentation of recorder, harpsichord, and other medieval/Renaissance sounds that continue on into other tracks.  Not only is the sound appropriate to the HP setting, but extremely evocative in a way that will no doubt tug at the heartstrings of the audience.<br />2) &quot;Finale,&quot; which includes the theme from &quot;The Patronus Light,&quot; a quiet, ethereal vocal setting of some of the most strikingly simple, beautiful music to come from Williams in years.  Simply the fact that he places this, instead of the power of the full orchestra, behind the climactic moment in the film (which would no doubt fit without anyone flinching) is truly a stroke of brilliance.  My only disappointment is that these tracks aren't longer!<br />While the eclectic nature of the music in this score (ranging from quasi-classical minuet to wild jazz to something sounding like Renaissance chamber music) makes it often seem disjointed and sudden in its transitions, I have no doubt that it will add the color to the film that Williams's scores have been lacking in recent years, and will be an engaging listen to anyone with a broad range of musical taste.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|My list of reasons why this cd is both good and bad.<br />What makes this cd bad?<br />1. The fact that all of a sudden after 6 years of making music slipknot decides to put solos on their cd that they were once so adament about not doing.  But i guess since every other metal band is doing it they decided to jump on the bandwagon.  Don't get me wrong i love the complicated guitar work, but just the fact that they decided to do this now that everyone else is doing it makes me mad that they're compromising what they said they'd never do.<br />2.The fact that they put two acoustic songs on this cd completely undermines their fans and shouldn't have been done at least not on this album.<br />3.Coreys scream is different for some reason not that this is a completely bad thing but if they wanted it less deathmetal they should have kept it like it was on the self/titled album.<br />4.The emotion from the self-titled cd and was hinted at on iowa is almost completely gone on this cd.  There is barely any spooky or unsettling auras about the songs anymore<br />5.Their should have been at least one super heavy song like heretic anthem, at least one come on. Besides after hearing iowa people would have probally been more forgiven if their was a really heavy song in the style of iowa. Their also should have been more songs in the vain of &quot;the blister exists&quot;:).<br />Why this cd is good<br />1.The diversity of the songs is something that many people may not like but I, myself am a diverse man.<br />2. The song structures are some of the best from slipknot that i've ever heard.<br />3. They're not doing the same thing over and over again.<br />4. This cd wierd enough seems less commercial to me then iowa.  I mean the songs &quot;left behind&quot; and &quot;my plague&quot; sounded really commercial to me.<br />5. This cd sounds less contrived then iowa.<br />6.If anything this cd isn't bad. As far as i'm concerned its a really good cd in all, all of the songs are well done and it's not nearly as bad as iowa was.<br />So if you are one of those metal heads that are anti-melody (even though when metal first started out it was mainly melody)and don't think this is heavy enough, then this cd may not be for you.<br />But if you are into all different spectrums of metal then you will definitely like this cd.

B00009Z574|2.0|Note: This review is about the Rhino packaging, remastering and bonus tracks of this 2004 edition.  As for the songwriting &amp; musicianship of Tormato, I'll just quote Rick Wakeman: &quot;Tormato could've been tremendous.&quot;<br />1. PACKAGING - The liner notes begin with four pages of excuses. It explains how Tormato suffered from &quot;too many cooks over the broth [producers]&quot; and &quot;heated debates&quot; and &quot;lack of rehearsal&quot; and &quot;individual rather than collective goals&quot; (these are direct quotes from the CD booklet). It really spoils any hope you might have of enjoying the album objectively. In place of this gloomy commentary, I would have prefered to see more photos of the band or artwork--both of which are noticeably lacking.<br />2. REMASTERING - Unfortunately, the original source tapes are so awful that no amount of EQ, compression and 21-century wizardry could tidy up the swamp. I had my hopes up after hearing what a good job Rhino did with the Drama album, but after listening to Rhino's Tormato and comparing it with the original CD &amp; vinyl releases, all I can say is: &quot;Well, it was a noble effort.&quot; Tormato is, was, and ever shall be very thin: muddy bass, nonexistent midrange and tinny guitars. (Please don't ask about the keyboards and vocals which are trebly to begin with.)<br />3. BONUS TRACKS - Umm... interesting but awful, all 10 of them. With a good sense of humor, you may enjoy hearing how terrible Yes can sound in the rehearsal room. Just to illustrate: I was listening to the bonus tracks when my mom came in the room and asked, &quot;Is this your band?&quot; 'Nuff said.
B00005ATQD|5.0|A colleague took a verbal potshot at this film before he knew how much of an allegiance I have to it.  He, a former German literature student, did as all literature students and graduates seem to want to do -- trash film.  Oh, how benighted they!<br />Kubrick may have known how to make mistakes.  After all, he was a perfectionist and likely thought everything he did was flawed.  This film, however, is one of the more revealing about abruptly-formed and -forming sexual relations I've seen.  And about the near-destruction of a sound relationship from a moment of wounded macho and several sequential adventures, mysterious and fey.<br />Granted, it's not Arthur Schnitzler's book and doesn't take place generations ago. And it's not in any sense 'captured realism'.  But its 'take' on daily -- hourly -- temptation is about as honest as one can manage in drama.<br />Women seem a bit put off by it, if my small sample means anything.  That sample covers women of 'high character' suspicious of the body as any portion of an element deciding how we should behave.  The stylized orgy tableaux turned them so far off that the knobs broke.  I believe one summarized her response as 'disgusted'; the other said, 'It's a man's movie.'<br />Yes. It's hard to keep staring at something so threatening to normalcy.  Dark powers -- human, not Satanic -- govern activities that verge and even overlap our lives.  We keep our lids down, don't we?<br />Kubrick's characteristic lingering camera fills our time with sinister reality: the subtlety of 'frozen' facial nuances, tarty, material interiors, the deep emptiness of 'things'.  Visually, the director was a king.  Let a lot be said, also, for his continued excellence in developing a musical score: pop surface mingles with the Shostakovian waltz ironies and the minimalist, tailored-to-suit Pook.  I play the soundtrack in my car as an ironic test of my spiritual sobriety.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I saw someone say that if you don't like this album you are not a metal fan. Well MeTaL GaNgSTa you don't know much about metal music then. This is not metal. There is nothing metal about it. Ferd can Rhyem? So what if he can Rhyem. <br />Folks this band sucks. Fred sucks. Heck he even knows they suck. Linkin Park stink to. <br />You want Metal music really metal music go get a Megadeath CD. Or a CD by Nightwish or Nightrage. Heck even go for other bands such as Flowing Tears. Those are metal bands.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Well it looks like we are in the midst of a an anti-Dream Theater backlash. Many of us(myself included, although to a lesser extent than most) tended to be a bit over enthusiastic in our praising of this band, and their fanboys tend to be of a particularly obnoxious and devious breed. So I can't say that the backlash completely undeserved.  However, I don't think that this is the album that should've instigated it, and personally I like it second best of theirs that I own.(I haven't got the debut or FII)<br />It is standard practice for bands to insist that their next album is going to be heavier than the last.  It is substantially less common for this actually to occur, which is what has happened here.  Make no mistake, this album is FAR heavier than any of their others, and is more consistently metal-oriented as well.(i.e. more loud parts which are now louder)  This, naturally, means that it doesn't employ the sort of tonal changes and genre-hopping that DT is known for. Take this as you will, as it is certain to be a detractor for many.  Personally, I find the relative lack of fruity keyboards to be anything but a flaw.  It would appear, however, that most disagree.<br />Personally, I've always been a metal fan, first and foremost, so their moving in a more conventionally metal direction is what I'd always wanted.  Petrucci's new guitar tone absolutely crushes his earlier work, and the keyboards have a much subtler roll.  They are, however, not as dimished as many seem to claim.  Now the 'boards tend to texture and color the guitar riffs primarily, rather then provide leads and counter melodies.  They are, however, usually doing something and are still fairly integral to the album.<br />The downside fo the more metallic turn is that Labrie is not as well suited for heavier material.(which has always been a dangerous contradiction in their music, as the vocals are best suited to do the opposite of what the instruments do best)  He does a good enough job, for the most part, but isn't really ideal either.  The inclusion of some distorted vocals generally works pretty well, but every once in a while Labrie just comes across as a wimp.(and at one point in Honor Thy Father, a bit ridiculous) He works best when he is less angry and more of a melodic counterpoint to the instruments, and this, fortunately, is what he does most of the time.<br />It standard procedure to claim that whatever DT album is your least favorite is the album where they stopped making music and just started 'wanking'. Naturally, this is what many say about this one.  This really isn't the truth.  Although the instrumental sections may bore you, they aren't really much longer or more frequent then they usually are on a DT album.(and they definitely aren't as long or common as they were on SFAM. Not by a long shot)  However, the instrumental sections are a bit less varied then before, which may make them seem longer.<br />All this may sound less positive then the rating I've given it, but in the end the various flaws in this album add up to less then they appear.(as they always do, for DT and me anyway) This album is 70 minutes long, and still consistently compelling.  As I Am is the controversial opener.  It's got a definite Black Album flavor wrapped around lengthy and particularly wanktacular solo, but it works pretty well.  The chorus is perhaps trying a little to hard to be memorable, but I still kinda like it, and it's got a solid groove.  Not the best thing on here, but not as bad as lots make it out to be.  This Dying Soul is my favorite track.  The chorus is great, and it's got a good set of riffs.  The second half is weaker then the first, particularly when Labrie pulls out his Mustaine imitation, but it all stands up well enough.  Endless Sacrifice starts out as a power ballad which launches into one of those crazy instrumental sections that they're so found of.  The later sections are the best part of this song, particularly the great little Maiden-y lick they throw in twice towards the end of the instrumental part, and the following vocal section.  Honor Thy Father is probably the heaviest thing here.  The vox don't always work, but the riffs are pretty ferocious, and the odd, vocal sample section works pretty well.  Vacant is the non-metal interlude.  Not to great, though I rather like the cello.  Stream of Consciousness is a nice long instrumental.  Unlike their other instrumentals, it is very cohesive, with a few(very good) basic riffs and melodies slowly evolving rather than the wild mutations and genre-hopping which define their other instrumentals.  Personally, I prefer it this way, though most DT fans don't seem to.  In the Name of God is the closer.  Very long and epic, lots of atmosphere with a solid chorus.  The instrumental break in the middle is a bit too long, but the vocal sections carry the day.  The slow outro is quite effective, particularly the unexpected use of The Battle Hymn of the Republic.<br />Well that's about it.  Pretty different from their other stuff, but I really like it, and prefer it to most of their other material.  However, odds are pretty good that you'll disagree so consider yourself warned.n-y lick they throw in twice towards the end of the instrumental part, and the following vocal section.

B0001NBMBC|3.0|Well first off, I'll say I LOVED their first 2 CD's. <br />But this is just such a let down. Yeah, it's good I guess in it's own right...but so was Load for Metallica. I don't mind softer, but the overall production sound to this is crappy. It reminded me of St. Anger from Metallica...Lar's pie tin drums. It's not nearly that bad, but it's pretty raw. I think a lot of this CD could have been improved just from a better production.<br />I haven't listened to this more than 3 times, so I am sure a few songs will grown on me. They are much softer, so I'm sure I'll be able to sing along subconsciously...but they are not a band I wanted to &quot;feel&quot;. I want to put on Slipknot when I hate someone...not when I want to light a lighter and wave it over my head.
B000001FFR|5.0|As big of a fan as I was of Among the Living and Persistence of Time, I wasn't immediately drawn to this album.  I can't really imagine why, but I didn't bother checking it out until a friend of mine bought a copy.  I listened to that with him, and was highly impressed.  This album can't quite match either AtL or PoT, but it's still of very high quality, and quite different from either of those, which makes it more than worth owning.<br />This album is substantially less thrashy than their following few albums.  It's got much more of a NWOBHM feel with an obvious Iron Maiden influence.  Frankly, it just barely qualifies as a thrash album.  Still, despite stylistic differences, their talent is already apparent.  Charlie is already a first rate thrash drummer, with a lot of energy and nice use of the double bass, and newcomer Bello's bass makes it presence known, unlike just about every other thrash bassist out there.  Ian's rhythm guitar isn't a tight or sharp as it would become, but it's noticeably more melodic and can still thrash it up quite efficiently.  Belladonna's vocals are also more melodic than they'd later be.  He's a little over the top occasionally, but that's alright, especially in conjunction with the more light-hearted feel of the album.<br />Over the next couple albums Anthrax's lyrics became progressively more serious and dark.  On Spreading the Disease, however, they are almost completely non-substantial or light hearted.  This wouldn't work for every thrash band, or album, but it works here, and makes for an album which is more genuinely fun to listen to then lots of other high quality thrash albums.  This is also more hook-driven then just about any other thrash album I've heard.  Fortunately, they almost always work, and pretty much every track has a nicely melodic and immediately memorable chorus.(and a nice pre-chorus too, much of the time)<br />The big standout on this album is Lone Justice.  Unspeakably catchy, but with the riffs to back it up.  A.I.R. is a classic opener with all the energy that such a title entails.  The closer, Gung-Ho is probably the thrashiest thing here, with an absolutely outstanding main riff, and a copmletely silly but still very enjoyable chorus/pre-chorus.  The Enemy breaks the mood of the album, as it is a very serious minded song about Hitler/Holocaust etc.  It still works, although it certainly isn't the best thing here.  Stand or Fall and Aftershock are the relative weak points, but they are still some solid early thrash.  Lastly, although the rest of the song doesn't stand up to some of the stronger material on the album, the intoduction to Armed & Dangerous is just great, perhaps the best part of the album.  Great vox from Joey. Lots of melodrama, perhaps, but rather effecting as well.<br />Anthrax were one of the best thrash acts around, and this is one of their classic albums. Get it.it up.

034544678X|5.0|I really enjoyed Patricia McConnell's writing style and humour. Her willingness to make you aware that she too isn't perfect and has to stop and re-group sometimes when attempting to communicate with her dogs.  The book is full of incredibly useful information relating to dogs and how they view us and the world. If you truly take the time to read and absorb the riches of this book, you'll never look at any dog the same way.<BR>I love learning why things are the way they are and because of this found this to be a very rewarding read. It all made so much sense.  <BR>    Sometimes I did find myself getting a bit restless when things got all scientific, but even that was necessary a lot of the time and I pushed myself through them anyway because I knew something of worth was going to come of it.  I wonder if part of my restlessness was because I was anxious to find out what else I was going to learn.  It's worth the effort if you find yourself feeling like I did.  Patricia's skill at story telling and obvious love for dogs makes you feel so good and had me reading every page top to bottom (even the tiny notes on the bottom thatIwould normally ignore or not notice) I wanted to learn everything I could from her.  I learned as much about our species as I did about dogs.  <BR>   Once you see how dogs viewthings you'll be able to communicate much better and it can't help but benefit your relationship.  Please do your dog a favor and read this book!
B00006AFUR|5.0|This is definitely one of the best CD's I've ever bought, and definitely one of the best releases of 2002. I saw the video for Capricorn on MTV and I started to investigate more about this band.  I searched for their CD everywhere and I couldn't find it here in my country, so I had to wait until my girlfriend went to the US and she bought it for me.<br />It doesn't sound like anything else that I ever heard before.  They have a very futuristic and atmospheric sound and I love every song on this CD, it's one of these CD's you can just listen to from beginning to end without skipping any tracks.  It's definitely a must buy.
B000059TEP|3.0|Almost everyone will find something to like about this film, but other parts can really get your knickers in a twist.<BR>Despite having heard the tune for years previously, I didn't really like &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; until it was featured in the movie.  There are many surprises here...Demi's unusually convincing performance, Whoopi telling us about traffic patterns in the spirit world (&quot;I got spooks comin' in from Jersey!&quot;), Swayze developing his telekinetic powers with the help of the &quot;subway ghost&quot;.  Yet there is also Whoopi's annoying ad lib attempts at humor, the uninspired &quot;afterlife&quot; special effects, and the uncomfortable subtext of the plot...that Demi loves the Swayze character even more now that he's deceased (shudder).  The theologically inclined will get to weigh in on how the court system in the afterlife would rule on a &quot;revenge killing&quot; plea.  Hey, and if this necrophiliac spook-infested romp really is a good movie for Valentine's Day, heaven help us all!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|For all of u who wrote bad reviews should be ashamed of yourselves. U call yourselves fans of slipknot? Well true fans would stick by slipknot even if they went all out acoustic. So I admit Corey's vocals are a little softer then we all might have hoped for, but the material is unbelievable. The lyrics aren't as disturbing as the old Knot, but guess what? For all u guys who gave this cd a bad review, just to let u in on a secret, people change. The Knot wanted to broaden their musical horizons, and u all bring them down, calling them sellouts. Truth is, u r all the real sellouts. Buy this Cd u will not be dissapointed!
B0001NBMBC|3.0|Well, this album is a great album. i have to say the guitars are amzing and show a MUCH better change, musically. Overall when you look at this album, people will say, ah, its not heavy at all...and this is overly attributed by the fact that their are 3 acoustic songs. My first impression of the acoustic songs blew me off, as it did to many Slipknot fans (i assume).<br />So The bottom line is, Slipknot has changed. I dont want to say that this is a bad album, because by all means, it is tramendous. However, coming from a band like Slipknot, its quite disappointing, and depressing. I mean, i understand that change is good, and Slipknot has defyed what any other bands ever tried to do and came out with a great album, but its just not exciting anymore. I dont wanna hear this from Slipknot, i want to hear that crazy, sonic-power, swearing, f**ckin pissed off music that we all new this band was their for. That was what they were here for anyway, to seek and destroy the music scene with their ruthless aggression and i loved this about Slipknot. <br />I am going to leave this albums rating at 3.5/5 stars only because i dont want SLIPKNOT to change and i dont want SLIPKNOT to make this stuff...i want someone else to do this.<br />When I went to the record store thinking of buying VOL 3: i had the intension of being able to break something (or someone) upon hearing the rage i was expecting.....not gonna cut it this time, guess i'll have to pretent their KoRn, or...sumthing when i listen to them from now on..
B0000C83YJ|5.0|The best voice in pop in the 1980's and the best pop album of the early 1980's.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|ok I wanna set one thing straight to those who think that there are shreds of Stone Sour in this cd, (...).  This cd is nothing less but an increadible spectacle of the band that is Slipknot.  In throughout the whole album you can hear that every single member of Slipknot plays there part whether it's Sid with his turntables, Paul with his underestimated bass riffs, 133 putting in his samples and working out the media, Chris and Clown with hardcore percussion that really stands out in your head in \\"The Blister Exists\\", Joey putting up his talents as being one of the best friggen drummers alive which he stands out in the last 40 seconds of Circle and all the way through Three Nil, Mick and James putting out excellent solo work into \\"Welcome\\" and \\"Pulse of the Maggots\\", and Corey . . . . .he has progressed in his music career having an extense range as a singer and the God of screaming the melodic sounds of his voice in \\"Circle\\", \\"Duality\\", \\"Prelude 3.0\\", \\"The Nameless\\", and \\"Vermilion Pt. 2.\\"  This album quickly put Slipknot as my favorite band of all time just by hearing the first 2 tracks and I was completely blown away.  The have a wide diversity in their sound from the bone crushing sound of \\"Three Nil\\", the progressive Pink Floyd sounding \\"Danger - Keep Away,\\"  and the tear jerking and creepy sounds of \\"Circle.\\"  This album has anything that an open minded Slipknot could ever want.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Just picked this up. This is a really good album. I heard they mellowed out and went soft but they actually didn't. The music is top notch and shows they can truly play their instruments well. From the brutal to the beautiful, this album rocks.
B00000342V|5.0|The late, great, Curtis Mayfield's Superfly soundtrack may be the best soundtrack album ever.  Why? 1) because it works standing alone on its musical and lyrical merits; and 2) because it works when played/heard in the context of the movie itself.<BR>As to 1) the music is still fresh and meaningful - even now, 32 years after the film was first released.  It can be said of Curtis Mayfield's music and lyrical poetry that he 'kept it real' (Choice of Colors, Keep on Pushing, etc.) even before the phrase was invented and well before it became a hackneyed cliche.  From Little Child Runnin Wild to Pusherman, Freddie's Dead, to Superfly itself - the combination of Mayfield's voice, his guitar work, the beat, and his lyrics sounds as fresh today as they did when I first saw the movie many, many years ago.<BR>As to 2) the music as a soundtrack to one of the big Blaxploitation films of its day served as a startling contrast to the film itself.  The drug-dealing Superfly, Ron O'Neal, was built up (at least in my neighborhood) as an inconoclastic hero of his age.  But, Mayfield's music, while complementing the movie's ploit line also served as a grim reality check for anyone taking the time to actually listen to the lyrics.  This counterbalance made the film far better than it would have been without a soundtrack because it served to say  hey - Superfly might be one cool guy - but remember - Freddy's Dead. The music served (as another reviewer suggested in comments on the non-deluze edition) as a Greek Chorus that kept providing the movie with musical reality checks.<br />This may be some of Mayfield's best work.  To me at least it has stood the test of time.
B00006HBUB|5.0|I love watching Scooby Doo all the time!!!!!!!! I thought this movie was really funny and it depicted the series really good. If you love ScoobyDoo I suggest you buy this movie today and pop it in your dvd player and watch it over and over.
1592400876|3.0|I found this book very well written.  It made much more sense of puncuation than I have previously known.  The writer draws you in and appeals to the sense of humour.  I found impelled to continue reading even though the subject wasn't one I found I had obessed over before.  It was a very easy book to read, other than the more difficult quotes; which the author agrees are misleading.  I have rated this book 3/5 as the subject is not appealing.  I would read any further books by the same author.
078322687X|5.0|The Breakfast Club I have to say is the best 80's movie ever made!!!!!!! I love watching every moment of it on videotape and when it's on tv. I also love the whole casts! I can almost say every line in that movie!!
B000002KET|5.0|Could \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" be the group's finest track? It's hard to decide, but it is certainly one of the greatest rock riffs/songs ever written. It even sounded great when the Cardigans covered it (omitting the cry \\"You bastards!\\" from the lyrics of course!)<BR>The double guitar tracks in \\"A National Acrobat\\" are fantastic and I can't listen to Slayer without calling them to mind. \\"Fluff\\" is the by now standard instrumental track, whilst \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\" is a fast and lively affair, unlike the slow synth-background of \\"Who Are You?\\".<BR>\\"Killing Yourself to Live\\" is a track whose lyrics are more relevant to the Ireland I subsist in today than at any other time. \\"Looking for Today\\" is a good track, and alongside tracks on the albums of most other groups would be the gem. It's one of the less interesting tracks on this album, not that it's bad - it's just not as brilliant as the others. The same can't be said for \\"Spiral Architect\\", which hooks you in lyrically and muscially. A fitting finale to a brilliant rock album.
B00005JM02|5.0|I love watching the Finding Nemo dvd everytime that I get the chance to. It is such a hilarious movie to watch with the whole family. I also love the dvd extras and the ability to turn my tv into a fish tank. If you love adventure and comedy all rolled into one, I suggest you buy this movie and watch it with your whole family for some fun.
B0001HAITK|5.0|This movie is absolutely stunning!!! The real yet breathtakingly fantastical scenery, the sweet innocence of the young leads, and the adventurous storybook tone all add up to one incredible film, and if you haven't seen it, permit me to say that you are the wierdest person in the world. I used to wonder why most of the kid actors in family movies are pathetic and unconvincing. Now I know: Peter Pan grabbed all the good ones! Unlike some of Disney's live action movies, the casting directors were attentive with the lesser characters as well as the leads, and the result is a very strong fabric from which the actual story is made(I love the Tiger Lily and John parts!). The leads were all cast ideally, so much so that I cannot imagine ANYONE else playing either Wendy or Peter. And this has nothing to do with Jeremy Sumpter's beautiful green eyes, so put that thought RIGHT out of your little head. Ahem. Basically, I have never seen a better movie that I can watch with all my siblings. You can't go wrong with it. I DO BELIEVE IN FAIRIES!(No, I 'm not going to TELL you the context. Go watch the movie.)I DO! I DO!
B000089CJI|5.0|I'm not a huge Death Cab fan, nor an electropop fan, nor a fan of any of those 80's bands mentioned in other reviews, but this album has sealed a place in my heart like recent albums by Wilco, the Flaming Lips, and Modest Mouse, because of its honesty and creativity. The first song should get to you by about 2/3 of the way into it, but if not, give the album a few chances and it'll become a part of your life.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Whoever says that change is a bad thing needs to understand that stagnation is the kiss of death for musicians. Who wants to hear the same thing over and over again? The guys in Slipknot understood this and chose to evolve. An evolution that has paid off for them in a big way. This album transcends their previous two albums and shows that they are no longer conforming through nonconformity. <BR>This is their best yet.
B0000640SA|4.0|Otnemem (Memento) Is a powerful story of revenge following an Insurance Inspector (Guy Pierce) who witnesses his wife's rape and murder.  However, when he tried to stop it he was knocked unconcience and suffered a head wound that kept him from making new memories. The last thing he does remember is her murder.  Now he must bring justice to the one who did it.  To remember things he must tatoo them to his body.  A terrific Film for both Nolan and Pierce.
1400032717|4.0|Some folks I've spoken to about this book say it's a good book for teens.  In general terms I'd tend to agree except for one thing: this book gives readers a detailed glimpse at a small (but apparently growing) segment of humanity that is not often discussed or widely understood.  For that alone it's well worth anyone's time, moreso because it's a quick read.
0156012197|2.0|This books is just not my type of book. I did not really get anything from this book because I have to go over the metaphors before I can understand it. Anyways, this book tells the grown ups all over the world that they can still use their imaginations even though they have matured and have a job. This is some connections I heard from Einstein. Einstein said that Imaginations are more important than knowledge because Imagination creates knowledge. This book made me read it even though I wasn't very interested to it because it makes me think deeply of some words that are hard to understand and while I read the book, it reminded me of my childhood because I use to use my imaginations, ofcourse, probably all the kids use their imaginations. Now that I have grown, I forgot about imagining because I've grown up a lot. Just like in the book, when the little prince was growing up, he is losing his imaginations.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I waited and waited but all in the end as soon as i got of school me and my friend jack went to bestbuy and bought the album and listend to it for a couple hours and duality,plus of the maggotsm,blister exsists are the best songs on that album youve got to get it.. yet it isnt there best album it is great... if you want to get there greatest album get iowa it has heretic anthem-best song ever...
B00008GKEG|3.0|although its very well made and i did enjoy it, i feel like so much was skipped over..lots of details about the Beatles and their lives..many things were left out..<br />-talking about early member Stu Sutcliffes death<br />-more insight into Brian Epstiens vision when he became manager<br />-dealing with the Beatles in their times and thier relationships with contemporaries (the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys etc.)<br />Mick Jagger appears many times throughout the documentary but no mention ever about the 2 bands rivalries which is a compelling  part of the story<br />-little talk of the musical progression from the early years through the more complex ablums and how the band got there<br />-absolutley no mention of their relationships with their wives girlfreinds etc. til disc 8 when they couldnt avoid the &quot;Yoko situation&quot;<br />-very little talk of thier song writing progress, weve all heard the songs a million times and loved them..but over 8 dvds some stories about the inspiration for songs or how they came about would have been great..(there are a few, Dear Prudence, Hey Jude..but far too few)<br />-the recording process, no talk of the mess the let it be sessions were and how Phil Spector came in and cleaned things up so to speak<br />-failure to discuss the fact that Let It Be was released after Abbey Road<br />-the breakup, the solos albums, etc..all very much glossed over<br />overall if your a fan id recommend the Anthology, the perforance and news reel footage is great, but it seems like the &quot;story&quot; of the Beatles and their lives is a bit watered down and could have been delved into even more<br />for my money still the best documentary ive seen on the beatles is The Complete Beatles..about 6 hours shorter but for some reason i didnt get much more out of the 81/2 hr Anthology than i did from the Complete Beatles documentary<br />it just seemed because the beatles were the producers some things were skipped over, some things were left out.t.
B000055ZDT|5.0|Electric Wizard has set the standard here for doom metal bands.  From the opening track Vinum Sabbathi all the way through, they rock out in such a way that Black Sabbath would be proud.  The vocals have some distortion and the guitars are kind of sludgey but all this just enhances the masterpiece that this band has created.  If you are a fan of Black Sabbath, Sleep, or just a metal fan in general, buying this album is something that you should do.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed.
1400079179|5.0|I think this book does achieve one primary objective.  It forces people to get out of their usual comfort zones and begin to explore Christianity a bit deeper than what was learned in Sunday School. Further, this was a highly suspenseful book with great action and Brown is able to put the reader in the midst of some of the more descriptive scenes in France.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but I can understand how many out there could give a poor rating. Once individuals are forced out of there comfort zones, a backlash of sorts will result from it.
0618526412|5.0|This is a wonderful book full of simple joy and sadness.  I think most anyone would enjoy it.  McCullers uses her characters to magnify elements in life I think we all can relate to in one way or another.  I highly reccomend this book.<br />However I do suggest you ship with someone *other* than UPS.  My copy arrived with water damage to the book and box and so I filed a claim with UPS.  They paid it, but now they won't deliver to my house unless I am there to recieve it!  Their little way to punish me I suppose.  (I mean I live in the desert, it's not like it rains here!)
B000002WU9|5.0|I always have loved Only Built 4 Cuban Linx.  Raekwon and Ghostface are the best rappers on wu tang in my opinion, and they have the best storytelling.  Raekwon was always more fun to rap to among the two.  This is rhymin, 36 chambers wu tang style, and it doesn't distance itself from the original album.  Choice cuts for me were &quot;verbal intercourse&quot; &quot;ice cream&quot; and &quot;heaven and hell&quot; i listen to this cd from begin to end, but it still is good to put in just to listen to a song or two.  buy it if you are into original wutang.  RZA produced,so its rizza razor sharp.  I wish Raekwon could still have raps the same caliber as these.
0618084835|5.0|&quot;Sense and Sensibility,&quot; Jane Austen's first published novel (1811), tells the intertwined stories of two contrasting sisters, the lively, passionate, impulsive Marianne and the reserved, self-disciplined, dutiful Elinor.  Both experience love, heartache, and eventual happiness in marriage, and both have their beliefs and value systems tested.  A host of memorable, comic minor characters combine with the principal heroines and heroes to develop a tale that is both lively and thought provoking, humorous and psychologically astute.  Anyone who has ever struggled with conflicts between spontaneity and caution, heart and head, can identify with the central characters of this novel.<br />  This edition of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; includes a number of helpful supplementary materials that enhance the reader's understanding and appreciation of the novel.  Excerpts from contemporary texts clarify the historical context of the terms \\"sense\\" and \\"sensibility.\\"  Among the works included are selections from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther,&quot; a classic example of the novel of sensibility,  and Maria Edgeworth's &quot;Letters of Julia and Caroline,&quot; an earlier novel of contrasting female characters, in this case two friends, one of whom is sensible and the other romantic and impractical.  The edition also includes the whole of Jane Austen's &quot;Love and Freindship&quot; (sic), a hilarious parody of sentimental fiction written when Austen was fourteen.  Besides background materials, the volume includes four essays from recent critics that represent a range of different interpretations of the novel.<br />  Finally, the introduction provides useful biographical and historical information and outlines a variety of critical approaches to the novel: some critics believe Elinor is clearly the favored sister and the sense she embodies the preferred value system; some critics by contrast believe the novel either consciously or unconsciously betrays sympathy for Marianne and the sensibility she represents; and other critics believe the novel advocates a middle ground between sense and sensibility, according to which both sisters need to abandon aspects of their initial beliefs and adopt attitudes and behaviors associated with the other sibling.  &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; has sometimes been criticized for being too didactic and formulaic, but those who read the novel along with the various background, critical, and introductory essays in this volume should discover a work that is richly complex, ambiguous, and many-sided in its exploration of the competing values of emotion and reason, spontaneity and restraint, and personal fulfillment versus duty to others.
B0000C7PSW|4.0|Multi-talented Canadian singer-songwriter geniously conceived double album of sorts finally gets it's release, as the first part, Want One goes the motions of Wainwright's talents and unique sense of humour, especailly on tracks such as Vibrate \\"I try to dance like Britney Spears/ I must be getting on in years\\" and the inspired Gay Messiah. For years Wainwright hasn't quite made it in the UK, but after listening to Want One, that is one mistake that will be fixed.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Renee Olstead could turn out to be the discovery of the decade. With a voice as nuanced, versatile and downright charming as they come she's about to set the musical world on fire with the release of her first major-label album. <br />The fact that Renee's still in high school (!) may give her extra credit, but she doesn't need it. This jazzy-bluesy torch singer can easily hold her own with the big gals like Norah Jones and Diana Krall while evoking the young Doris Day and even Roberta Flack. <br />&quot;Renee Olstead&quot; has several break-out tunes which stay in your head for hours, including her spellbinding and swirly &quot;Summertime,&quot; her impeccably voiced &quot;Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby&quot; and her deliriously beautiful remake of Maria Muldaur's signature song, &quot;Midnight at the Oasis.&quot; <br />Unlike other famous musical wunderkinds whose precocity (and notoriety) is much more apparent than their artistry, Renee Olstead doesn't overachieve in the slightest. Rather, she is utterly convincing as an assured and adept stylist with an affinity for music given to few. <br />After hearing this extraordinary album I can fully understand the raves it's been getting from professional critics as well as their collective disbelief that this is &quot;just a kid&quot; singing.
0743454529|5.0|Several years ago on vacation in NH, I found two relatively unknown local authors, Jodi Picoult and Dan Brown (DaVinci Code), who have been my favorites ever since.  Hard to pick a favorite of Ms.Picoult's books, but this could be it.  Reading the jacket made me a little weary with the heavy story line, but you will not be able to put this book down.  We've heard of parents having children to help save their other children and never thought twice about it - I think most of us would do the same thing.  Well, this book is extremely thought provoking.  It is told from many people's points of view, primarily 13 yr. old Anna's and her Mom's. What this family, and all of the families dealing with children with cancer, go through is absolutely heart wrenching.  I loved the characters and the plot twists - just sorry it had to end.  This would make a suberb bookclub pick - especially for good for Mothers to discuss.  Great read!
B000274THQ|5.0|Well written and thoroughly entertaining film combining fact, fantasy and full of emotion.  The love for a mother and the importance of her Communist dream set the scene during which the characters take a good long hard look at their own lives.  Her dreams are not wasted as they soon become a seed of 'if only' and the ending gives hope to what could have been - it will touch reformists and socialists alike with a human face and wonderful story of friends and family.  If you dream that a Socialsit Paradise could have existed then this is the film for you! You may even find yourself singing along with the DDR National Anthem at the end! (Which ironically speaks of a united Fatherland - the lyrics were made redundant and only the music permitted when the Cold War heated up in the early 60's)
B000002G7E|4.0|White Light/White Heat is a delight, an album of pure pop with a reputation nearly as black as Lou Reed's 'Berlin'.  The subject matter is dark enough, but the melodies and musical development of the songs themselves are recognizably descended from early 60s pop.<br />What renders these bright and sparkly pop songs so unlistenable is the production.  Most production, whether classical, jazz, or pop, aims to advance the goals of the music, to travel in parallel lines with it.  Take, for instance, the career of Neil Young: the quieter self-reflective stuff, such as 'After the Goldrush' and 'Comes a Time', gets crystal-clear recording and a lot of sonic separation between instruments; the darker, withdrawn stuff (the Doom Trilogy, Sleeps With Angels) gets off-the-cuff recordings with obvious, intentional mistakes and a messy feel.  Each production decision supports the goals and development of the music and lyrics.<br />The production on WLWH, however, is aimed at damaging, restraining, perhaps even destroying the music's effect.  Take the title track, a bouncy number about speed; any sane (or conscientious) producer would have played up the jangle and made damn sure everything was well-separated.  The music on this recording, though, seems to have been made with one (maybe two) mics, blending all the sound into one mess that's mixed equally with Reed's voice.  It's pop music played with a chainsaw.<br />Equally important to most pop producers is the centrality of the vocal.  Listen to &quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot; or Cale's cover of &quot;Hallelujah&quot;; the vocal is what you're supposed to listen to, the music just complements it.  Here, though, there's an almost perverse competition to drown out the vocals.  Special circumstances account for &quot;Sister Ray&quot; (one take, four musicians all trying to play loudest), but EVERY SONG (well, with the exception of &quot;Here She Comes Now&quot;) is as determined to destroy or suppress the vocals.  That kind of perversity takes dedication AND talent, and comes to the fore on &quot;The Gift&quot; -- a hilariously black short story where the music renders John Cale's words inaudible in many stretches.<br />None of this is a bad thing.  'White Light/White Heat' is an album at war with itself, one segment of music constantly seeking to destroy what another has created.  This aptly-titled album is the sort of musical self-immolation that incandesces.y takes dedication AND talent, and comes to the fore on &quot;The Gift&quot; -- a hilariously black short story where the music renders John Cale's words inaudible in many stretches.<br />None of this is a bad thing.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|WOW, Avril Lavigne has done it again! Her debut album &quot;Let Go&quot; was a smash but she topped herself with &quot;Under My Skin.&quot; I love every song on this CD! If you are a fan of her previous work you won't be disappointed with her latest.
0061020710|4.0|This is the first book in the Discworld series and Terry Pratchett does an outstanding job of introducing the \\"logic\\" that reins in this world and some of the main characters that inhabit it. It has been a while since I found a book that made me laugh so much, the author has a great sense of humor, and he uses different means and techniques to make the reader roll on the floor with laughter.<br />Discworld rests on four giant elephants, Beriha, Tubul, Great T'Phon and Jerakeen, which stand on top of the giant turtle A'Tuin. The people in this world have asked themselves the same questions over and over through time: What is A'Tuin's sex? Where is the world going? The answer to the second question is evident...to where A'Tuin decides!<br />I cannot help but feel that the fantastic world that Pratchett has created is based on our own \\"old world\\" with elements of the new one mixed in. For example, glasses, or cameras are considered elements of magic. Of course, the author does not stop there and adds other fantastical elements to the mix. One of the \\"regular\\" concepts we are used to handling in our world that made me laugh like crazy is inn-sewer-ants; sorry but you will have to read the book to figure out what this is, I do not want to give that much away!<br />The story starts when the oldest city in the world, Ankh-Morpork, is burning. Rincewind, the most useless wizard ever, is escaping from the city with Twoflower, a mysterious tourist that comes from the distant and mythical Counterweight Continent. When they are safely away from danger, we start learning about how they met and what were the events that lead to the fire. In this tale and in the one that continues after the characters leave Ankh, we will meet various characters, all of them picturesque and with a great ability to amuse.<br />The only negative aspect I can point out is that the world, characters and rules are a little complicated. Add to this the fact that there are no maps, since as Pratchett says \\"You cannot map the sense of humor\\". Anyway, I think that once I start reading the following installments in the series I will be able to get a more thorough understanding. The series well deserves the effort in doing this.\\"You cannot map the sense of humor\\".

B0001NBMBC|3.0|Slipknot's first 3 CD's &quot;Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat&quot; &quot;Slipknot&quot; &amp; &quot;Iowa&quot; were great albums and get the standard of what Slipknot's music is about. I'm not against evolving in the music industry but this album is NOT Slipknot. Don't get me wrote this is a good CD but it doesn't come close to there previous 3 albums. If you are a bigger fan of Slipknot's more melodic material than there heavier material this album is for you, BUT if you like Slipknot for there heavier more edgy material don't buy this album.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|I,ve been reading the reviews and alot of it sounds like stone sour, but it still sound sounds dark and tragic to me. You can still hear the old Slipknot in most of the songs. I like the inserts on the intro of each song it sounds evil or haunting most of the time.Just skip the last song because I think it really is stone sour. Experimental is a good word but it seems they were influenced by the mansion they recorded in or some good pot I don't know. Its differant but slipknot always was weren't they? Lets hear mudvayne or mushroomhead try to copy this. Besides I'll just skip the stone sour like songs or someone will think I'm getting soft.Who am I kidding I'm just as disappointed as all the other metal heads. Slayer never sold out and they still rule.
B000001FBS|4.0|when I first bought this album I thought it was gonna be crap, cause KISS themselves always talk about it as if it was a disaster, boy was I suprised!!, This album is very cool people!!. Dense people that only like songs about sex and Rock n Roll, will not get this, but this is really a cool album, and is not nearly as bad as most people make it out to be<br />Dark Light is one of my fav songs!!!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril has got a more rock sound to this album than the poppy &quot;Let Go&quot;. I loved &quot;Let Go&quot; but this one is even better. It's stronger in both music and lyrics. She worked with Ben Moody from Evanescence and Fefe Dobson in a couple of the songs. Its pretty broad in sound too... there are some soft acoustic songs, some harder elec. guitar songs that remind you of &quot;Unwanted&quot; off &quot;Let Go&quot;, which was the hardest song off the first album. Overall this album is excellent. If you liked the first one, you won't be disappointed. If you didn't, then you have a perfect oppurtunity to still become Avril fan.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Um...so like...is this another Stone Sour CD, or is this really Slipknot?!! If so...WHO TAMED THEM?!! So does this mean that I have to go buy a friggin' Nora Jones CD now or what?!! Now THAT is scary music!!

0446310786|5.0|The story of the hero Atticus Finch who defends a black man charged with the rape of a white woman. Told by young Scout Fincg, Harper Lee tells the story of a young white girl's exposure to racism in the south. To Kill a Mockingbird is a true heroic story that forces the reader to think and reflect.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Wow!  A short word I know but that was the feeling I still had when I left the theater after watching the Kill Bill Vol.2 for the sixth time.  Beatrix Kiddo(Uma Thurman) remains on her path of revenge but little does she know the path is about to throw her a few curves. Along with the physical challanges of her quest,in Vol.2 we see her come alive emotionally; in a variety of situations that are both scary and heartwrenching.  Throughout this movie we are entertianed by a supporting cast of former and active killers.  Bud(Michael Madsen),Bill's down and out brother;is the most interesting to watch.  A short conversation between Bill(David Carradine) and Bud, eludes to a history that would have been nice too have gotten into;as it is Tarantino leaves it up too our imaginations.  From there on we see Beatrix's strengh,now and when she was younger and after a thrilling dispatch of Elle Driver(Daryl Hannah)Beatrix's anger turns towards Bill.  We learn that Bill is more than he seems.  A lowdown murdering snake too be sure but he also shows us his \\"sweet\\" and tender side and with his \\"ace in the hole\\" he begins a systematic breakdown of her defenses.  Both actors do a wonderful job of acting and the only reason Uma and David will not see Oscar nominations is because action films are generally overlooked.  Hopefully I'm wrong on this one.  The ending is an emotional roller coaster,which leaves you waiting for the inevitable and when it comes,you may or may not like it.   Personally, I think I have a better ending for this movie but I'll keep it too myself.  In any event, this movie left me feeling good and eager too see it again.  A wonderful romp.  Well done!  Well done!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Im glad that slipknot has taken a new &quot;edge&quot; to their music.  This album has everything, heavy shredding, ballads, and melodic heavies.  Dulaity is simply awsome as is The Bliser Exists.  Slipknot has finally taken a new direction and it is sounding great.  This album has travelled from their others and I think is much greater.  If you are complaining about their sound then your ears are busted because now Slipknot makes music and it soundes great.
B000148KK2|1.0|The &quot;enhanced&quot; part of &quot;enhanced CD&quot; causes problems if you want to listen to this on a computer. This is NOT a standards-conforming CD (doesn't have the registered &quot;CD&quot; logo) and the disc itself has fine print at the edge saying there's no guarantee whatsoever. This warning is NOT on the outside of the package.<br />I suggest you avoid the &quot;enhanced&quot; and get the &quot;regular&quot; CD
B0001UL7RY|4.0|After her successful release of &quot;Let Go&quot;, Avril has made it again. After listening to all the songs in her new CD, I got really impressed. The lyrics are much more meaningful in this CD and her voice has matured, just like Michelle Branch did in her latest album, &quot;Hotel Paper&quot;. Here is a review of the songs:<br />Take Me Away: 8/10: Cool for those who like screamy and angry songs. <br />Together: 8/10: Again, a bit screamy but very catchy.<br />Don't Tell Me: 9/10: First single, great song (Chorus is really catchy)<br />He wasn't: 8/10: Okay song.<br />How does it feel: 8/10: Nice ballad out of this CD.<br />My happy Ending: 8.5/10: Story-telling song, very pop.<br />Nobody's Home: 9/10: Great song with powerful lyrics, meaningful and good music overall. <br />Forgotten: 8.5/10: Cool song.<br />Who Knows: 7/10: It was okay but I didnt liked it that much. <br />Fall to Pieces: 7/10: Same as ^<br />Freak out: 8/10: Great song for a bad, angry moment. <br />Slipped Away: 9/10: Another great ballad like &quot;How Does It Feel&quot;<br />Well after averaging everything, I came up with a 4-star decision. Very well-done Avril ^_^ I really recommend this CD to everyone, you will like it, trust me ;)
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I brought this cd today, the first day that it came out in canada and i have to say that i love this cd.  The lyrics themselves are so much more meaningful and intimate than avril's first cd and her voice has matured to give us an amazing cd.  <br />Here's the rundown:<BR>Take Me Away: 6/10: This was an ok song, but she seemed to be screaming when she goes up to the upper range.<br />Together: 7/10:  very catchy song, but again it seemed like she was yelling a little bit...<br />Don't Tell Me: 9/10: A great message to all those girls out there to not be pressured in giving away your virginity.  This song is probably the most popish out of all the songs...but it's her first single and made us all excited about her new cd..<br />He wasn't: 8/10:  I liked this song and the chorus is really catchy.  Try singing the chorus with her...it's kind of hard..<br />How does it feel: 9/10:  A very nice ballad....<br />My happy Ending: 9/10:  Another popish song but it's very catchy and sort of tells a storyish...<br />Nobody's Home: 10/10:  I loved this song....the lyrics are deep and meaningfull and the music is great...<br />Forgotten: 8/10:  Very cool song.....kind of brings in another type of style...sort of like .....hmm...i can't think of it righ tnow....but you'll see<br />Who Knows: 6/10:  Has a great message but i dont' knwo...didn't really like it...<br />Fall to Pieces: 7/10:  Not bad...<br />Freak out: 8/10: hee..A really in your face type song when you're really pissed off about something....great song..<br />Slipped Away: 9/10:  Best ballad in this cd...for her grandpa...reminds me about my grandpa...great finish...<br />I really recommend this cd too everybody...
B000148KK2|1.0|I have several of Diana Kralls CD's and I was very disappointed in the style of this one.  It's quite a departure from her previous ones - the music arrangements are not near as good - most of it sounds like cymbals and a piano.  I love her voice, but I wonder if she's trying to do Norah Jones instead of who she is.  They are both talented artists - but they need to stay with what has made them successful.  I really wish I would have listened to the music samples before buying!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I got the CD yesterday and listen to it diligently.  I love it. Maybe I'm byass because I'm from Iowa, but this CD is true rock at its best. LOVE TO ALL TRU SLIPKNOT FANS EVERYWHERE!!
0440237688|5.0|Several months ago I came across this book while browsing the Newbery Medal winners in my bookstore. I picked it up because it looked like a quick read and for some reason I was convinced the book would be about a Native American Medicine Man who takes on a young student.<br />To my chagrin, the book turned out to be about a communist type society. To be honest, I read the first 25 pages of this book and tossed it aside. Recently, I read a handful of the reviews at amazon and realized I may have misjudged the book. I returned to it, and forced myself through what I still believe is a very slow beginning. In the end, I am glad I read this book, as it eventually demonstrates the fallacy of the communist ideology. <br />I won't tell you what happens, but will encourage you to read this book. And don't do like I did and judge this book too soon. Keep reading. Keep reading.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is and will be the best CD that is ever made.  Whenever you combine 5 musical geniuses, especially the compositions of jonny greenwood and thom yorke, and add on top of that 5 young brits that just simply want to experiment and make great music,-- you get ok computer, a masterpiece.  Radiohead, simply stated, is a band of 5 mates that are the best at what they do.  Jonny Greenwood plays over 20 different &quot;instruments&quot; and plays the most unique guitar I've ever heard.  Deliberately going into his guitar and rewiring it to achieve a sound that has never come out of a regular electric guitar.  Everyone should do themselves a favor and listen to airbag, paranoid android, lucky, electioneering, and the tourist with the balance entirely on the left side of the speaker to appreciate his guitar solos and how unique they are.  I'm getting off the subject here.. let me get back to ok computer....<BR>OK Computer is like a play.  Transitions are amazing... the beeping noise heard at the end of airbag that then becomes paranoid android is so smooth it is a continuation of one song into one another.  It's got to be one of the best 1-2 tracks on any cd.  Each song puts you in another world where get entirely lost, either with potent and thoughtful lyrics, yorke's voice, or the immense amount of layers that are on each track.  Although this is considered an electronic endeavor, the guitars are what make the difference on this cd.  Thom's silent or acoustic guitar, ed o'brien's polite guitar, and Jonny's aggressive attack and distortion give a constant background noise that won't let you pull away from the music.<BR>Let Down and The Tourist are my 2 favorite tracks.  For a band that is &quot;depressing&quot; and hates the world, I've never heard 2 songs that sound so full of emotion and warmth.  Even though the lyrics are about going to fast or having the sense that you are caught in a routine where you feel captive, yorke's voice is always radiating hope.  Ofcourse the composition of those 2 songs are absolutely amazing.. especially when in let down before the &quot;you know where you are when broken lives have fallen&quot;.. you hear the music take a big upbeat swing before that chorus and it literally lifts your spirits and you immediately want to sing along with thom.  The Tourist may just be my favorite song of all-time (How To Disappear.. is amazing as well).  It's one of their most delicate songs and it was the best way to end OK Computer... After all the background noise throughout the entire CD, Thom is telling himself and everyone to just slow down and enjoy what's around you... and then closes it out with a &quot;ding&quot;... it makes the journey of OK Computer go full circle and your ready to start it all over again with the guitar attack of airbag.  OK Computer.. I can never say enough about this CD.  But if you are a music lover or you love music that is different and puts music in a different light, this is your CD.  Nothing comes close to OK Computer's aura.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Just because a band throws in accoustics with metal makes them suck or sellouts? True this CD is different from M.F.K.R. or their self titled album...but that doesnt mean its of any less quality. The guitars and are still have that raw sound...and the accoustics fit in perfectly. Songs like &quot;Three Nil&quot;, &quot;Opium of the People&quot; and &quot;Pulse of the Maggots&quot; still have that hardcore sound. While songs like &quot;Vermillion&quot;, &quot;Vermillion PT.2&quot; and &quot;Circles&quot; are more melodic. <br />I've been a Slipknot fan since M.F.K.R. Iowa dissapointed me I admit...but Vol 3 (Subliminal Verses) satisfied me. There is rumour going around that this is their last CD. I hope that rumour isnt true...but if it is they left us with a quality farwell CD.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|This movie is about a dedicated warrior (Beckinsale) who has been duped into fighting an interminable and ultimately senseless war, by an unscrupulous leader who is using the war to further his own very secret and twisted agenda.
0156027321|3.0|Yann Martel is probably very intelligent, and this book is witty and amusing and probably even insightful and I get the feeling that everything is one huge metaphor for something else, yet this feeling is accompanied by one of sheer bafflement at what it is exactly Martel is trying to say. I can tell its getting at something deep, something important, but I'll be damned if I know what it is. Damned. From a purely structural point of view, the bit before the boat sinks is highly entertaining, the floating in the boat is fascinating for a while, but it drags considerably in the middle. Is this a metaphor for something else? Draggin towards the middle? The ending is superb, probably the highlight of the book, and it really put this book in a better light for me than the rest of the amusing but vague narrative did. Maybe I wasn't paying enough attention, but I think a lot of people are pretending that they are gleaning pearls of wisdom from this book when they're really just as flabbergasted as I am. Still a great read though.
0142437611|5.0|\\"Seize The Day\\" is about the day Tommy Wilhelm hit his financial and emotional bottom and emerges from a lifetime of confusion and failure to find his true self, his spiritual self. Bellow's novel of psycological introspection and intrege compelled this reader to examine his own life a little closer. Maybe you will be fascinated by doing the same.
B00004YW6I|4.0|My first real taste of PJ Harvey, recommended to me by a friend, and I thoroughly enjoyed all of it. I particularly love the slower, more ominous songs like 'a beautiful feeling' and 'you said something', but I'm not against the happier songs at all. From the little I've heard of 'Is this Desire' I'd say that PJ communicates anger and depression a lot more beautifully than the kind of blisfull happiness of some of these tracks, but we shouldn't hold that against her. An awesome album, by any standards.

B0001NBMBC|3.0|I normally don't review albums in this nature, because I've seen too many people with uneducated opinions do so, which doesn't help anything.  But having been a Slipknot fan since 1999, since I bought the now hard to find version of S/T with 'Purity' on it, I felt something needed said.  I have never in my life heard a band with so much passion and emotion in their songs, literally.  They are completely insane (in a good way), which has set them apart as the icon which so many other bands reach for, and fail horribly at.<br />That being said, I have listened to S/T and Iowa endlessly to this day, seen them perform 5 times over their first two recordings, supported and promoted them at every opportunity, and listened to the new album non stop for the past 2 days (probably 15 times or more), anxiously awaiting 3 years for it. I hoped it would sink in or grow on me as a whole album, but it just hasn't.  Something is most definitely missing on this album, most notably the intensity.  A few tracks hint to the intensity and brutal complexity Slipknot has built a fan base around, but most are a mediocre serving of Slipknot at best.<br />Call it evolution, experimentation, whatever you want.  Here's the reality.  Don't buy this album hoping for a third dosage of front to back brutality, intensity and organized mayhem because it's just not there.  I loved all the numerous side projects the guys took on during their break (Stone Sour, Murderdolls, To My Surprise), all excellent in their own right, but they have most definitely bled over into the Slipknot sound. You only need to hear the side projects once to make that connection.<br />The mixing and mastering of this album is flat, hollow and tame, lacking the heavy edge heard on the first two albums.  Rick Rubin is a phenomenal producer and has done his job here, but Ross Robinson's 'throwing things' therapy was definitely more effective at getting the angst to emerge.  This album seems superficially angry and less 'real'.Although four letter words never make an album (and sometimes ruin one), the absolute lack of them on this album, even the aggressive tracks, make the pent up anger seem less genuine.  Everyone swears when they're angry (and don't pretend you don't).<br />They marketed this album as 'forget everything you knew about Slipknot' and the heaviest of their outings yet.  The two seem to contradict one another.  Their musicality and technicality has evolved, yes, but their overall sound has been left behind in doing so.  <br />American metal has been less than impressive as a whole for the last three years and needs a swift kick in the a** in the form of Slipknot brutality and perfection of insanity.   Vol. 3 serves as more of a slap on the wrist.  Good in it's own right, but a far cry from the unbridled anger and frustration so many of their fans related to on a personal basis, and sold millions of albums in the process.  I remain a devoted Slipknot fan and await their next dose of musical anger therapy, but this isn't it.  If it isn't broke, don't fix it.
B000002AGM|4.0|This album is worth owning if only for the title track alone, which is mezmerizing.
0790729628|5.0|Blade runner is a futurist nightmare set in L.A. in 2019.<br />The dark, cloudy and contaminated atmosphere , and the two billions towers surrounded of that claustrophobic gothic landscape persuades you something bad about to happen.This magnificent set inspired Tim Burton in Batman 1.<br />Harrison Ford is a police hired to kill an extraordinary generation of replicants , humanoids whose mission is to make the dirty work and gifted of emotive memories, but built to live just four years , who have decided to rebel.<br />In this frenetical search, Ford falls in love with one of them (Sean Young) and he must exterminate the other three.<br />Rutger Hauger is the leader of the group, and we have all along the film very smart clues; the Vermeer in the wall of a room, the sinister aspect of the city reminds us to Metropolis from Fritz Lang; and the presence of Edward J Olmos as the evil preacher; (who cares if you live?); like a leit motive musical in the story. Poignant moments in the romantic scenes and unforgettable sequences of splendid kinetic energy as the brilliant coreography fight against Darryl Hannah in the room of toys.<br />That ending climax final and the last dialogue Hauger-Ford are from its release in 1982 a classic.<br />The soundtrack from Vangelis is another important factor that adds aditional dramatic effect to the film.<br />Riddley Scott made his most intimate and even original film in this serious futurist scenario: and more over his other triumphs as Gladiator; Thelma and Louise and Allien 1 , this movie could remain as his masterpiece.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This kicks Let Go out of the park. Avril has matured quite a bit. Her style has changed quite a bit. She still sings about relationships, mostly, but Take Me Away, and Nobody's home, and I think a few others are about life, and being confused and stuff. Still, I think this one is better then Let Go.<br />She has particitpated in writing the songs on this album much more then on Let Go.<br />She's got some really catchy tunes on this one, just like let go, only it has no filler tracks.<br />Very good album...
B000066744|5.0|This work of Giuseppe Tornatore is an original issue in the celluloid.<br />The story tells us about a child born in the middle of the ocean , (so forget about what's his birthplace), that lack of no land human being gives him that mythical character.<br />The script shows the process of growing up of this boy , who gradually became in the official pianist of that ship called Virginian, (another smart clue) .<br />The time comes for him , the piano and his intimate friend , the trumpeter are the only friends he has.<br />All the story is told in third person, before a seller of old musical instruments and musical scores; I mean a true dialogue between two categories of memories ; the emotional and the historical.<br />In that sense Tornatore signs his directorial prints on his favorite theme: the memory. That's the clever device of Cinema Paradiso.<br />But the pianist (in a brilliant performing of this underestimated actor of one million carats talent, Tim Rith), refuses in every decisve moment to leave his own country ship; he belongs to it. He was born there and a invisible link ties him: not even the only love , and mighty inspiration motive for his best composition is capable of make leaving his water home.<br />Beautiful , poetical and amazing tale with multiple laughable sequences, are surrounded by that duty fate of mixing with the ground land .<br />An unforgettable experience that will reward you from beginning to end.<br />Don't miss this one.
B00000K19E|5.0|the deepest, most intellectual mainstream film in a long, long time.  this film takes itself a little bit too seriously, but other than that, it is incredibly imaginative, creative, and well executed.  i've often wondered why Keanu Reeves was chosen for the lead role, but whatever.  He does a decent job, particularly in comparison to his other work.  if there is one mainstream movie released in the last 5 years to watch, this is probably it.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|For months I waited for the new Slipknot to drop.  I work in a record store, so I got ahold of mine earlier.  When I went on my break I listened to all the songs.  If you are looking for songs like &quot;Spit It Out&quot;, &quot;The Heretic Anthem&quot;, and &quot;[SiC]&quot;  You won't find them here.  The metal is still on the album, just not as often. Corey (8) said, &quot;We had to get out of what we had made ourselves, we needed to grow as artists.&quot;  I for one, applaud Slipknot, they took a chance on doing something that was unexpected.  &quot;Forget everything you know about Slipknot&quot; was on one of the ads in magazines.  I admit that I was not sure what I bought, but after listening to the album pretty much non-stop, it's better than most will want to admit.<BR>My personal rankings of the songs on the album.<BR>Prelude 3.0 (3/5) - They say the first song sets the tone for the album, they weren't lying, you get your first taste of what is on the album.<BR>The Blister Exists (3/5) - This one sounds like Slipknot, lots of energy.<BR>Three Nil (2/5) - Yet another song that has a lot energy, guitars are awesome.<BR>Duality (4/5) - A lot of people thought this one was a new Stone Sour song.  I like this song, great guitars, drums are good too.  Shawn (6) with the keg and the bat makes the song better.<BR>Opium Of The People (2/5) - It has energy, I'll give it that.  Not a favorite right now.<BR>Circle (4/5) - Slow song, acoutsic guitars, and bells??  At first I didn't like this one, but the song is awesome.<BR>Welcome (3/5) - This is Slipknot, sound, energy, and feeling.<BR>Vermillion (5/5) - A Slipknot love song, not like &quot;Everything Ends&quot; on IOWA.  It's not mushy, it has a hardcore feeling, like a metal maniacs love song.<BR>Pulse Of The Maggots (5/5) - I really didn't like this song when I first heard it, but after listening to it and paying attention. This song rocks.  This is a song for the fans.  Not to mention a mosh pit song.<BR>Before IForget (3/5) - &quot;I am a worm before I am a man I was a creature before I could stand I will remember before I forget &quot;  Nuff said.<BR>Vermillion Pt. 2 (5/5) - Acoustic guitar again.....and harmony.  Basically Love Song Pt. 2.<BR>The Nameless (4/5) - Lots of energy.  Goes from metal to harmony.<BR>The Virus Of Life (5/5) - You can't really hear Corey on this one until he hits the chorus.  But the drum work is sweet as hell.<BR>Danger, Keep Away (4/5) - This song reminds me of &quot;Gently&quot; from IOWA.  Except instead of guitars and drums, you hear an organ.<br />All in all, when you first listen to this album, you probably won't like it much.  Stick with it, hopefully you'll attach to a song or two.  There is not one single swear word on the entire album.  To me that takes talent, anyone can swear, but it takes talent to convey emotions without them.<BR>But this is just mine opinion.  Listen to the album for yourself.  It's not as bad as A LOT will make it sound.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne's new album, Under My Skin totally rocks!!! The songs are more meaningfull, have a better melody and have REALLY good lyrics. The first single, Don't Tell Me, and the second single, My Happy Ending are VERY good and all of the songs could be released as singles-that's how good they are! The songs were almost all written with Chantelle Kreviazek and there are a few songs that were written by Avril herself. The music to all the songs is good to jam to or dance to with lots of feeling put into them. In total, this album is much better than the first!
B0000640VO|5.0|&quot;Amelie&quot; is the most wonderfully charming film I have ever seen.  It's quite possible that, upon reflection, I'll consider this to be hyperbole inspired by a recent viewing, and I'll give &quot;Amelie&quot; a more reserved rating, like &quot;it's one of the best films I've ever seen.&quot;<br />&quot;Amelie&quot; tells the story of the title character, played with a seeming impossible combination of daring, reserve, romanticism, idealism, and fear by Audrey Tautou.  In a performance where she is speaks very little (one of her struggles is that she is an observer of life who must eventually find a way to &quot;live&quot; her life rather than watch it go by), Tautou nevertheless steals the show.<br />Well, almost, 'cause the city of Paris gives her a run for her money.  If you are a fan of Paris, you will absolutely love this film.  Lovingly shot, the film gives us a Paris that is so perfect that it cannot exist in real life.  Colors are slightly exaggerated through clever filters and lighting, and the charming little details (such as the elaborate cursive menu on a restaurant window) are evocative of the film's romantic spirit.  <br />One of the most original plots in years, &quot;Amelie&quot; tells the story of a woman who has always sat on the sidelines.  As a child, Amelie was so nervous when her reserved father touched her (only during medical examinations) that her pulse raced, leading to the misdiagnosis of a hyperactive heart.  As Amelie grows into womanhood, she has always sat and observed, and with a wonderful imagination has created an alternate universe for herself.  This imagination carries through to her adult life, and manifests itself in delightful ways (no other character in cinema could melt away into a splash of water at the sight of her true love).<br />Through a discovery of a long-lost box of childhood trinkets and the sad-yet-blissful restoration to its rightful owner, Amelie resolves to bring cheer and zest to the lives of her fellowParisians.  Not content to whisk a blind man down a crowded street, narrating all the peculiar sights, sounds, and smells of daily Parisian life that he can no longer fully appreciate, Amelie takes it upon herself to be, at times, a match-maker, an instrument of revenge against a local bully (hilarious comeuppance alert!), and a re-writer of heartbreak.  <br />One of the most entertaining subplots of the movie has to do with her father, who even though he has the freedom to travel (he is a widower, brought about through the most freakish of accidents) refuses to do so.  Amelie sends his beloved garden gnome on a travel across the world, including pictures sent from abroad to her mystified dad.<br />Of course, a romantic spirit like Amelie's can't avoid falling in love.  But when she falls in love, it can't be a straightforward seduction.  Elaborate courting, hilarious misunderstandings, and a boiling-over romanticism make for a powerful conclusion to a charming film.<br />Note:  the DVD does not have an option for listening to a dubbed English version - if you don't speak French, you're going to have to work with subtitles.  I don't speak a lick of French, but listening to the dialogue in French adds something to its romance, so I think this is an improvement rather than a burden -- if I had the option, I'd still go with the subtitles (this works with other foreign films, too, like &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; and &quot;Like Water for Chocolate,&quot; where dubbing just doesn't work).  The DVD has some good extras, too -- we're not talking a Peter Jackson treasure trove, but they are worth it.<br />Easily one of my favorite movies, and one that you will want to watch again and again.

B0001N1RU8|3.0|Is that while she has a great voice and is a talented pianist, most of her work to date has been of the paint-by-numbers variety. There is far more art in creating your own songs than in \\"interpreting\\" someone else's. An occasional interpretation is good for the writer, but when that's all you do then you are no more an artist than my kid is when she uses her coloring books. She's damn good at coloring, but it's still just coloring.<br />With this album she has taken risks and made herself more vulnerable and therefore more able to connect to an audience. Is this the greatest collection of songs I've ever heard? No. Is it a nice first step with some memorable moments? Yes.<br />Good for her. Keep it up Diana.<br />As for the person who said Elvis Costello is a racist, care to elaborate? That's a heck of a thing to just throw out there. I assume you are referring to the unfortunate Ray Charles comment from 25 years ago, which he has applogized for. Does anyone else have anyhting they did 25 years ago they regret and didn't represent their true feelings?
B000089CJI|3.0|The first time I listened to this, I borrowed it from a co-worker who was in love with Postal Service.  I thought it was total crap, boring, and every song the same.  About a year later, my girlfriend went out and bought the album.  After hearing it a few times, I'll say that some of the tracks have grown on me a bit.  It's poppy, and has a few quirky synth-melodies that catch my ear.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album is definetly really good if you like Metal.  Once you listen to it for a while then you will start to respect the changes Slipknot has made in thier music since thier last 2 albums.  <br />I have always been a fan of slipknot since thier first album came out and their music just keeps getting better every album! This album is indeed much different then thier other albums, but it is also much more interesting to listen to.
