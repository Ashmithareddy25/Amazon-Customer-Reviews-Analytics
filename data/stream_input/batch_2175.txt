B007N8RULO|3.0|The game itself is easy to play. The best feature is the one tap to move the cards. the faces of the cards are easy to see as well ... that there is a commercial before each game is annoying.
B009X01FJS|5.0|This is a great cover for my Kindle HD.  It protects it in case it drops or gets bumped, and it is easier to prop up while you read. The color makes it easier to find it quickly.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|This was a quick download to find a quote. As it is an old classic favorite there is really nothing to do but give it high marks.
0767812166|5.0|Jeff Bridges is great in this older movie.  It is a poignant look at how we run our world and how we could rise above..........
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is narrated in a nice way, good positive message all around and the formula for stength building is awesome. I have come accross a lot of fitness articles but i strongly feel that only two books - this book and BFFM (burn fat feed muscle), are most complete and do not emphasis around selling any brand of supplements. I have followed \\"Strong lifts\\" for a short period of time and got good improvements in strength but that required me to feed my body heavy since all the 3 lift days target heavy compound exercises and large muscle groups (i utimately ended up injuring my shoulder). I strongly feel that the strengh builiding formula as depicted in this book will keep us away from injuries (especially when you are cutting down on your calories) and a working one. I have already started my workouts and am on my day 3, had completed squats 9 sets of 4 reps each - felt good. Keep up your good work Michael.
B009329Y30|4.0|It's not as good as The Notebook or Dear John but it's cute.  I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it, and I didn't.  Thank you Amazon!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I first enjoyed the modern Sherlock Holmes from the BBC.  Very enjoyable but the made so few episodes...  So when I heard about Elementary I thought to give it a try.  I feel it is far superior to the BBC production.  The Actor who plays Holms is so fun!  And they have abandoned the whole Arthur Conan Doyle story lines.  Which may be where the BBBc show is less appealing.  They are remaking classic stories.  But Elementary frees Holmes by placing him in New York with an addictions problem.  And gives it a more CSI approach, solving Modern cases with modern crimes.  I find it fascinating and wonderfully entertaining.  It really doesn't matter that Lucy Lu is in it.  Her part could be played by anyone.  It is all about Holmes and his delightfully sharp mind and wonderfully twisted personality!  Marvelous!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|You know that moment when you're reading and you come to a realization about a character that rocks your foundation? That moment you gasp and start to weep?<br /><br />That moment happened several times to me while reading this masterpiece New Adult story.<br /><br />After her adoptive mother home-schooled Sky for years, Sky finally has the chance to experience public school for her senior year. And what a ride it will be. Sky's bff Six has built a promiscuous reputation for herself, and Sky is guilty by association. It's not that Sky never makes out with guys, but she doesn't let boys get too far because she feels absolutely numb when they kiss her...<br /><br />...until Sky meets bad boy Holder. He's got a tattoo on his arm that says \\"HOPELESS\\" and a reputation of his own as a homophobic bully. When she first sees him, she notices:<br /><br />\\"1) His amazingly perfect white teeth hidden behind that seductively crooked grin.<br />2) The dimples that form in the crevices between the corners of his lips and cheeks when he smiles.<br />3) I'm pretty sure I'm having a hot flash.<br />Or I have butterflies.<br />Or maybe I'm coming down with a stomach virus.\\"<br /><br />Holder is an adorably sweet and deep book boyfriend. Sky feels unmoored when he's in her presence, and she's puzzled by his strange fascination with her. They happen to share a love of running...but what exactly are they running from?<br /><br />Serious pain.<br /><br />As Holder helps her uncover her past, Sky will need to keep Six's words of advice in mind:<br /><br />\\"Life is real and sometimes it's ugly and you just have to learn how to cope.\\"<br /><br />What amazes me about Colleen Hoover is that she writes about horrible ugliness, but somehow makes it okay as I watch the characters realistically struggle on their path to healing. Instead of hopeless, she makes me feel hopeful.<br /><br />This is my favorite read of 2013. If you're looking for something fluffy, look elsewhere. But if you're lookingfor a real story about love, pain, loss, and gain--get this book now!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Very good book, one the best I have read. I highly recommend it.  If you don't tear-up several times through-out the book, especially toward the end, I would be surprised.
B002UAJ0BS|5.0|Great quality, packaging was very protective, very pleased and impressed. Recommended for anyone who is looking to purchase music products
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie was a bit of a surprise, it has a great cast, a good story and even the more minor characters were well done.  The scenery in this flick was also really beautiful !
0307744434|5.0|I just read some of the one-star reviews, (sometimes I think they're the best to read) and I completely disagree with the ones I read. True, there is A LOT of detail about the circus, but it adds allure and believability to the story. Every word the author writes is purposeful and adds to the book; there was never a time that I thought, \\"Ugh, there's too much description!\\"<br /><br />Ms. Morgenstern has written a beautiful book about a challenge between a girl and a boy (the book spans several years, until the protagonists are much older) that is mainly set in Le Cirque de Reves. There is so much detail about the circus that I felt like I was there, walking as a patron amidst contortionists, illusionists, dozens of striped tents, vendors selling spiced cider and chocolate mice, musicians, a brilliant, magical bonfire.<br /><br />The book seemed to have a cliff-hanger at the end of every chapter! It was especially aggravating near the end of the book, because one chapter will be in this month, on this day, in this year, from the perspective of this character, and then the next chapter will be set in an entirely different time, miles away, and from the perspective of another character. It was a very interesting read, partially because of these shifts. You get to hear the story from almost every character's point-of-view, and Ms. Morgenstern always went back to (FINALLY!) tell us what happens.<br /><br />I long for the circus, and I truly wish there was such a thing as Le Cirque de Reves. I feel as though I could stay there my whole life and never miss out on anything.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I really liked this movie since I really like all the movies, this was also the first movie I watched on my new 3D HDTV, it was awesome!  The stories, the explosions, everything was killer.  I highly recommend this movie!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book. It caused me to feel every emotion. I couldn't imagine going through the this these 2 went through
B005C0DHIK|5.0|Very disturbing and true. To many people are living this story. Take the time to watch it no match which side of this issue you may be on.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|This was a gift for a runner.  He says it works well and he likes it.  Has not used all the bells and whistles but is looking forward to  trying them out.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|perfect on kindle fire i love it best app ever love how it doesnt take up too much space on internal storage.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This is the fourth CD I have by Susasn Boyle - I love her voice - it's so clear and<br />beautiful.  Some of our most beautiful songs are on this CD including Send in the Clowns and Memories.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I read Follett's Fall of Giants on my Kindle. I bookmarked the list of characters (in the beginning of the book) and, during the first half of the book, I referred back to it often to keep all of the characters straight. Invaluable! His opening chapter drew me into the book immediately! I learned a great deal about World War I and thoroughly enjoyed the book. I really came to care about the characters, especially the women since they were active with suffrage movement. Great read!
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen talks about stuff that she would never talk about on her show you need to read this book because she's so encouraging and its so funny! <3 Ellen DeGenerese
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Although, I do miss David Tennant as the Doctor, the writing on this show just keeps getting better and better. Matt Smith is a great Doctor. He and Amy Pond are a great team.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|This is probably a child's game.  But as an adult I enjoy playing it.  I would recommend to for an ange group.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Ok he is credited with lots of good stuff, well he and his people, who he seems not to credit, did it. His excuse is I am who I am. he appears to be stunted in the 'member human race' category. fine i did not start Alpple or invent the products he did...but come on treat folks who work for you laike human beings.. It is well written and does present an unvarnished look at him.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome it is the 3 favorites in my collection<br /> this game is the bomb yes it is I love this game
B0094WK9EC|5.0|What can I say?!! Swedish House Mafia Rocks!  Glad I got their CD.  If you like Techno/Rock Music, this is a great purchase.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|The Next Generation is my favorite of the Star Trek Franchise, and it is so great to watch it again. The actors were great, and even though the tech is outdated, it is a great show. The first season was a bit rough because they had not yet really grown into the roles, and the second season lacked Dr. Crusher because of a reported dispute between Gates McFadden and one of the writers. In season three, the writing improved, Dr. Crusher was back, and the cast really has come together. While I do wish we could have had Whoopi Goldberg in more episodes, I really do love this season of this great show.
B0000041Q3|5.0|This is the most wonderful purchase.  I love this opera.  I have it in record form, but no player.  I was so happy to finally purchase the CD.  I listen to it each day.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Interesting subject and strong characters but somewhat cliched plot takes away from the overall reading experience. While I enjoyed the book I would not highly recommend
B0063IH60K|4.0|Game plays well and loads fast. Sometimes I wonder if the cards are fixed :)  I like the tip icon if you need a little help.
1592407889|5.0|Sachi Parker has a great story to tell and she and her co-writer have artfully created a riveting page-turner that I could not put down.  I believe every single word of this memoir and I will never look at Shirley MacClaine the same again.  The bitter edge that comes through in some of MacClaine's roles seems to be her default mode in real life.  (She has a \\"four hour\\" max when it comes to being gracious to friends and fans.)<br /><br />Refuting her daughter's writing, MacClaine says it is fiction.  I don't believe her.  It is obviously an honest, warts-and-all memoir of a troubled relationship, and the central revelation is so shocking and strange that the reader is left thinking Ms. MacClaine needs to have her head examined, which, although she will adopt practically any new age charlatan who stolls down the pike, will never happen since MacClaine sneers at the idea of therapy for herself.<br /><br />Sachi tries hard to give us a rounded picture of her mother, showing us the lovely, warm mom-and-daughter journeys they took as well as the sad and strict manner in which she was bounced around the globe ... all in an effort to keep her out of the picture.<br /><br />My own father, like MacClaine  was a fellow \\"new ager\\" who started a commune in our home when I was a teenager.  Sachi describes with tactful humor how hypocritical new age adherents can be.  As my father traveled around the globe in search of gurus and granola, we kids stood by and watched his quest involve him so entirely that there was little left over for us.  I have always marveled at my father's limitless gullibility when it comes to spiritual masters who turn out to be mere, power-hungry megalomaniacs to whom you or I would not give the time of day.  But I am fortunate in that he also possesses a limitless capacity for love and a warmth that has always kept us near.<br /><br />Thank you Sachi Parker for sharing your odd, remarkable story.  I'm glad it finally saw the light of day.  Five Stars.  Great read!at read!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A must read. Members of my family have been cancer patients and I am familiar with the concept. This book is beautiful.
0671449028|5.0|My son is really enjoying all the Sandra Boynton books I bought. They are very sturdy and not too many words per page for a small child.
B009FZHYKU|2.0|I had to cancel my season pass after episode 9 and 10, those were possibly the worst fight scenes I have ever seen. I don't think they consulted anyone on those scenes, as they were wholly unbelievable and totally lame. I'll wait for the show to hit Netflix or something because that was just sad.
067144901X|5.0|I love Sandra Boynton books. My son is 14 months old and is really enjoying his books. My 13 year old niece loved Sandra Boynton when she was little as well. They are not too wordy and can hold the attention of a small child. Very sturdy cardboard.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It's fun. I love it. Great way to pass time. Glad it's not a tilt style game. I recommend it, great nostalgic FEEL TO it. It's the Irish version of Super Mario.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|This is an excellent in-depth Doc that anyone who enjoys Bob Marley's music will enjoy. I learned a lot about him and Jamaica. I highly recommend watching one of the better Music doc's I have seen, good production as well and rare footage. Make sure you set some time to view it because it is a bit long, I watched it in two segments.
B00280LYIC|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. It was fun and heart pounding! It had a good story line, and very descriptive
159413586X|5.0|Pretty much the same as Catching Fire except for totally different because it's a new story!  Also its a book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game. Makes a nice change to temple run. Great graphics. Fab! Wish there were fewer adverts though. I'd highly recommend.
1594135851|5.0|Its a book, how could you go wrong?  Just pick it up and read it.  We have to start F'ing reading Amryka or we will own your sorry asses!  Good pace too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this app because it gives you something to do and you are not bored out of your mind that is the reason I say five star
B0060GUZ7Q|5.0|Great movie, unexpected developments, great cast, extremely well done, totally Japanese! Mr.Kitano is great, on the par with Mr.Mifune's best work
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|This was  the very first app I ever tried to download on my Kindle and, since no one could reach me on Facebook, I couldn't download this app. It looks fun, I admit, but Dragon Story is better. I've heard these two games are similar, but Dragonvale requires a Facebook account. I recommend Dragon Story instead. DO NOT DOWNLOAD APP IF YOU DON'T HAVE FACEBOOK ACCOUNT! (Playing on mom's Kindle right now.)
B000HKYOK0|5.0|What more can one say about a series that gave us a look at a future that can be. Kirk rocks as the best captain of NCC 1701!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book makes you feel like you're right there next to, Chris. Incredible book. I couldn't wait to get home from work to pick it up.<br /><br />I finished the book the day he was killed. Tragic.
B0046ECFRM|4.0|I liked how these teens could come together under similar circumstances and bond.  It was good to see friends supporting each other when life gets rough.
B00338QENI|5.0|For anyone who is interested in history, pathogy, physiology, sociology, medicine or just good storytelling this is a great read, as it has a little of everything.  A little bit of a ligher read than &#34;The Great Influenza&#34; but I enjoyed it just as much.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very interesting view from teenage cancer victims. Their views are written for teens and adults and expresses grief and joy. The teens show happiness and deep sadness over death and remissions shared with each other.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|A very well produced movie! I have watched all of the previous &#34;Bourne&#34; movies, and this one lives up to expectations!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I loved this. its what I use for home work and it gives me a clear answer. I highly recommend app for everybody to have.
B00340ESIS|5.0|I've been gobbling up lots of the screenplay tips  books lately, and I do find this one among the best.  Blake breaks things down in a very logical way, and he peppers the book with exercises that have drawn me into the process and helped me to get started.
B005K17RU0|4.0|very helpful...easy to understand.  Easier to use than Weather Channel app.  Get current weather fast and simple and up to date.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Most anything with Daniel Craig is great. There's only one better James Bond. The original. Craig is the number two.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Use this app all the time to get the current weather conditions.  Great to use when you travel to get up to date weather information.
1400069289|4.0|This book was amazing.  It made me closely evaluate my personal habits and how my brain works.  These aren't topics I'm normally interested in but this book did a great job of taking a scientific topic and making it interesting to someone who has zero interest in science.<br /><br />The business part of it felt forced to me.  I didn't gain much from that section.  Take it out and this book would have been even stronger.<br /><br />The first third and the last third of this book captivated my interest.  There's a reason this book is selling so well.  It's interesting and will cause you to closely evaluate your habits and how your brain works.  It is unique and well written.  Great book!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|There is never a dull moment in this thrilling movie! Well done in all aspects. Definitely deserved the academy award.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I'm more pleased with this case than I thought I would be. It's durable and has held up well to my almost-daily usage of the Kindle Fire as well as my 3 1/2 year old's less-than-gentle treatment. The stand works well. Overall, quote impressed.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Never got a chance to review season 1, so this is a combined review. My wife and I only started watching SOA because we were trying out the Amazon Prime free streaming HD TV. One of her friends loved the series, so we thought we'd give it a try. Well, we are now HOOKED! The plot twists and character development keep dragging you back in for more. In the beginning, you look at the Sons as an evil biker-gang. They run guns and they kill people. But as the characters develop, you see them as much more complex and even intriguing. After the 1st episode, I wasn't sure if I wanted to see the 2nd. But after the 2nd episode, I couldn't stop watching. We watched seasons 1, 2 & 3 in less than 3 weeks. We will probably finish season 4 this weekend. I see only season 5 left on Amazon Prime and it saddens me that it might be the last. BTW, SOA is probably 95% of why we are now full-fledged Primers.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Once you get into the &#34;:8&#34; range, this game is a serious brain challenge.  Gives a workout to aging brains!
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|It's a callandar that shows the moon phases, also the time of moonrise, and set.  If you need that information, or just want to have it because it's a fun fact, than this is the program for you.  The only problem is, that it's not a day planner.  You could have the same thing hanging on your wall, except on a wall callendar, you can write things with your pen on.
B00797MB0O|4.0|A little dark forum taste, but the acting was very realistic.  The story line took to me back to my high school drama days.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|It has  a great plot line that thickens the story of Beautiful Creatures. There were a few things that could have been different. I did love all the twists and turns throughout the book. I am ready to read the next one in the series.
B008IBP24C|5.0|I love the music and the visuals and some one-liners from the characters, esp. Lady/Cousin Violet, the Butler (Carlson) and Mrs. Hughes, the housekeeper.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a book you can't put down. After finishing it I immediately bought the other two books inthe trilogy. Great emotional insight into a young person's coping with very difficult situations.
B008133MDK|5.0|The writing and acting in this show is phenomenal. It's amazing to see what Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch can do with just one expression. I got really attached to the all characters really quickly. It is one big emotional roller coaster, but you can't help loving it. I recommend this show to everyone I know.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Robert Pattinson at his best. I enjoyed watching all the characters evolve especially Georges Robert Pattinson character. I highly recommend this DVD.
1401937519|5.0|It is by far the most interesting, honest and facinating book I have read on the subject of near death experiences, and I have read many. Anita writes like you and I would. Simple but touches her truth with sincerety. The teachings are congruent, easy and beautiful lessons.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a great read. I found myself laughing one minute then crying the next. I couldn't put this book down!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|American Sniper is a tribute to every brave member of our Armed Forces. Chris's patriotism, bravery,<br />and personal sacrifices are truely remarkable. He ranks number one with Gysgt Carlos N. Hathcock II, USMC, (the White Feather)
B003K025TQ|5.0|Don't get this CD if all you want is the sound your are used to from Rittenour. There are two songs that do fit that bill, however the rest do not. Now before you think that means don't get this CD, that's not what I am saying. I was actually really surprised by what was coming out of my stereo with the diversity on display. There are some wonderful blues numbers with Keb Mo' and Taj Mahal, then there is another blues by Joe Bonamassa and Robert Cray.  A third blues piece pairing B.B. King with Vince Gill and Jonny Lang and with the man himself Lee Rittenour. Some Rock/Fusion works with Steve Lukather, Slash and Neal Schon. There is a solo guitar song by Ge3orge Benson and even a classical guitar song by Andy Mckee. It goes on and on...just get it you won't regret it.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I don't think I've ever heard someone who can do the low, gravely, sultry voice and then turn around and do a lolita voice a second later... until her.  Such a sexy album; I love it.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|This thing is very compact and very useful for those who cannot do everything over Wi-fi with a Windows tablet. I was one of the lucky ones who was able to get a 128GB Surface Pro immediately after release. I decided that I could use a a 1Gbps USB ethernet NIC to perform demonstrations on the lab network when teaching classes. This device allows me to interact with student and test machines on my virtual lab environment without a Wi-fi router. It offers many link options and has so far been worth every penny.
B003LWN8F8|5.0|Dancy, pop-y, angsty, sad, funny... all describe this album.  While I don't think it's quite as accessible as Electra Heart, this is a fantastic album with a lot of great songs.  Highly recommended!!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Christian and Anastasia make want a love like theirs. Opposites really do attract. Against all obstacles (ex-lovers, different back grounds etc) this love grows and blossoms into a love to be envied.
B008EEB4TA|5.0|I can't even describe how in love with this album I am.  I just want to hop around my apartment singing along.  (But I don't.  I have roommates to think of).  SOOO many good songs on this album!!!
B000FC146C|2.0|The good thing about this book is you are so unengaged with the characters you couldn't care less when they die.  The story is hopelessly unbelievable.  The characters are unlikeable and unrealistic.  The men in the book are more like the dwarfs in Snow White then real people.  The only men who are attractive are the priests who drive Aston Martins and Lagondas.  Rein is the only other male who is not a dwarf or priest and is somewhat interesting.<br /><br />I listened to the Audible version.  Many reviews criticize the reader.  This is unfair.  While her reading is not excellent it's ok.  But book itself is what is second rate.  I have the feeling the author did not really have a story to tell, but just sort of drifted along making it up as she went along.  It reminds me of Tara Road, an equally poorly crafted novel.<br /><br />After listening for a few hours I was bored, yet continued.  Ten hours in, I didn't feel any better.  I finally finished the whole book, and now wish I had not.  What a waist of time.<br /><br />I know many people love this book and it was a best seller.  What can I say, Macdonald sells more hamburgers than anybody else, and some people think Macdonald's makes the best hamburgers.<br /><br />If you liked this book, you would be blown away by Tolstoy, Margret Mitchell, Ken Follett, or James Michener, to name a few.  The writings of those authors make this book seem horribly second rate, which is what it is.
B009K0OL06|5.0|After wife and I watched other shows trying to keep up to date on they would cancel them, i.e. Missing and Mob Doctor (thought these were great shows and couldn't wait for the next one to come out). We ran across Revenge. Had a friend tell us it was good so we rented first season on Netflix and got hooked. Now we trying to catch up with season 2 as fast as we can. We really love this show and using Netflix and Amazon we find we can't stop watching. The story line is terrific and intriguing. If your looking for a show that you can talk about and keep up with here it is but be warned you need to start with season 1-1 or you won't know the plot. The lengths this show goes to will BLOW YOUR mind and you'll find yourself deep into each episode waiting for the next one.
B007C3TVNA|1.0|Roger Ebert's review is on-point -- completely confused timeline, NO action, more of a collage than a movie. Saw it on DVD, wish I could give it zero stars.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Very well written plots and effects very entertaining to watch, gets you thinking about a possible future. I recommend it to all sci fi buffs.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I wanted to like this book so much, being an avid Harry Potter fan, but I was incredibly bored throughout the book, and it's a bit hard to follow in the beginning because it so rapidly changes characters.
B0083I90HU|5.0|This book is one of the greatest books I have ever read. When it came, the book was on good shape.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|The first half of the book started out so &#34;soul mate&#34; like.. but the second half just gets entangled in all this backdrop that bored me to tears... I kept thinking Holder and Sky were brothers and sisters, so that was a twist that I didn't see coming...<br /><br />Anyway, the first half expect to be delighted, the second half, don't read it.
B009HELT3C|5.0|I felt as though I was a part of this movie because it appeared as though I was watching it in 3D.  A must see for all Tommy Lee Jones fans and Will Smith fans too.  The storyline took me by quite a surprise!
B000FC10WU|4.0|I really liked this book.  I have been an Agatha Christie fan for many years.  I believe I have read all her books.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|and it was a terrifically funny and entertaining movie.  It was an extremely well put together movie for those &#34;alien&#34; buffs out there always looking to see or hear about more Area 51 stuff.  I really enjoyed all the little quips this movie had.
B000W4D94I|5.0|Package arrived on time. I absolutely love this movie and was so excited to be able to find it on Blue Ray
B00005K9LN|4.0|I HAVE TWO OF JUDAS PRIEST'S CD'S AND THIS ONE IS GOOD BUT SAD WINGS OF DESTINY IS GREAT. JUST MY OPINION ANYWAYS.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrest is awesome. If you are looking for ideas on just about any subject from clothes to food to pets you can find it here.  And if you are just bored it can solve that problem for you as well.  I could get lost for hours in the 'pages' of pintrest.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is a great game love that it makes you use your brain I cant put it down love it.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Each episode has a different situtation for the group to face.<br />Strange and off the wall situtations.<br />Great show without a lot of gore
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I really got excited to see this movie. After seeing this I am fully satisfied.the movie is awesome and it works well. But as a bond fan I am really disappointed as it has no gadgets and no band car to satisfy bond fans. Bond signature is missing.
B003VBNN7C|4.0|All around nice story line.  We love music, so it was enjoyable even if it would be considered cheesy by some.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Worth every penny. Who knew there was so intrigue in such a stately house. Every character is fun to follow.
B006O2QNOU|5.0|This movie had so much well defined characters.  The actors and actresses were all superb.  They definitely put the reality of the greed and power of money in the world of stock market.  Very good movie and would recommend this to my friends.
B00BHU9DUK|3.0|I love both main actors and they acted well but the entire movie looks like a play. It took away from the story!
B0054SMID0|5.0|Matthew McConaughey was at his best acting as the Lincoln Lawyer.  The twist and turn of the story was fast and unexpected. The love scenes and violences were neither exaggerated nor filthy.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|This show is extremely captivating and witty. It did a great job playing on emotions, it had me laughing and gasping. I can’t wait until the next season is out!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it<br />definitely. keeps me and my toddler entertained for a good amount of time. it does tend to lag a little though. no other apps can be running while this one is
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book explains weight training in layman language.<br />Just because this book is simple does not make it less effective....on the contrary it drives home the point. Having read several books on weight training most of them approach the topic in an academic manner which may be accurate though not effective since implementation maybe cumbersome.<br />I found BLS to have a good balance of theory and science backed up with simple instructions on the implementation of the exercise and nutrition.<br />BLS covers all facets of workouts, technique, nutrition etc without getting too technical or boring.<br />To summarize....BLS is a practical book on weight training for beginners and intermediate level.<br /><br />Suggestion to improve : recommend video links (for kindle edition) of all exercises indicated in the book.<br />Thanks Mike !!!
B003JUGQ38|4.0|If you are a Tennant fan then it is hard not to like Season 4. Most of the stories play well to his strengths and it is nice to see a companion who isn't in love with the Doctor. Donna Noble has spunk and personality and gives as good as she gets. The two part episode about The Library is worth the entire season - a great sci-fi story line that kept me on the edge of my seat even though I have seen this episode at least 3 times since it first aired.<br /><br />The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because there are one or two episodes that are rather predictable and don't give the actors much room to show their stuff. But hey, this is TV and given the fast paced schedules they have to follow to produce episodes, one can't really complain.<br /><br />This is the last season for this particular Doctor, and if you haven't seen how it ends, it won't be as you expect. Just as you think he is about to regenerate...
B004Y042N8|5.0|Kills a lot of time, puzzles are generally very easy but can pass time when I am bored but might need to drop it quickly to do something else. There are tons of puzzles I have played it many times and there is always something new.
B0040JCJOC|5.0|Always loved this band and just never took the time or had an opportunity to make the purchase. Wonderful addition to my collection. Good travelling album.
B008476HBM|5.0|I only regret Jane Austen did not write more books than she did. So fun and true! I read it many times.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I always find myself playing this game over and over. Its a fun quirky little game that can keep one entertained for quite some time!
B000001E2W|5.0|I noticed when I bought the CD long ago that A.I.R gets cut off. I always wondered why the band or the producer didn't know it just's cuts right off without notice. I love the CD overall.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Download it. I dare you. I'm sure you're thinking &#34;oh look a little dragon game I'll play it to pass the time&#34;, yeah right. You'll be addicted before you know it, this game is the best. I've tried others, and they all suck compared to Dragonvale.
0307744434|3.0|Why you should read it: I heard about this book awhile back from a fellow reader, and my TBR pile finally pushed it to the top on my Kindle. It was a hard book to rate, but the writing and plot are worth mentioning here. If you are a fan of a slow buildup, of burning mystery and angst, of flowery writing and long descriptions (and a fan of the circus), you'll love this book. There's paranormal spice, there's mystery, there's the mystique of being a night circus, and of course the duelists. But if you are a fan of quick reads, steamy romances and action, it might take you awhile to get into the novel.<br /><br />Le Cirque des Rêves is an entity all its own and one that will ensnare the readers interested more about it than magic and a romance built on dreams. It's worth reading, but personally I find myself gravitating to more action and violence.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The Martian is really a terrific read. Love the main character—which is a good thing because we spend so much time with him. I highly recommend it to sci-fi lovers.
0345529057|4.0|Got the box set as it was cheaper than buying individually.  Read them over several months.  If you like fantasy novels these are for you.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Nice period soap opera. Wife is a huge fan of it and has seen every season. The acting/costume design/plotlines are excellent.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Pleasantly surprised by how good this movie is; can't believe I did not see it when it came out in 2009.
B00846REIS|4.0|This was an interesting love story. It held my interest well. I read it in 2 sittings.<br />I am looking forward to reading the next crossfire novel.
B009Z5975A|5.0|This was everything I wanted when I ordered. Five stars! It was a great deal for these three movies. Loved it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a great series. Well written and captive. I love how the series was wrapped up. Best ending ever!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Again I do not like the way we have to leave feedback on Amazon website now. Please go back to the old way.<br />This seller is highly recommended!
B0081336FO|5.0|Such an amazing way to continue the story.  If after watching the first season you didn't feel absolutely engrossed in the story, there is not way to not be after the second season!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Again I do not like the way we have to leave feedback on Amazon website now. Please go back to the old way.<br />This seller is highly recommended!
B00499NHLC|5.0|The storyline grabbed the attention of the viewer from the beginning and would not let go.  Recommended to not watch unless there is free time.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Again I do not like the way we have to leave feedback on Amazon website now. Please go back to the old way.<br />This seller is highly recommended!
B005I6EVUG|4.0|Fits perfectly on my Kindle Fire HD and looks cool but as stated previously wished it stayed closed....has a magnet on the edge but is useless once the cover is put on.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Again I do not like the way we have to leave feedback on Amazon website now. Please go back to the old way.<br />This seller is highly recommended!
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|This was familiar territory a great Reacher story. I very much enjoyed reading it and look forward to Lee Child's next Jack Reacher book.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|Had to see first season after enjoying the second.  Can't wait till second season is released.  I think it is better.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Great movie for the family. I enjoyed it as well as my daughter. Great quality. I purchased this as an instant video rental.
B004IY6API|4.0|I've always liked Judas Priest. I won't say I'm a die hard fan, but I do like listening to them. Stained Class starts off JP in a new direction, one that broadens their horizons both lyrically and musicially. We start off with \\"Exciter\\" and has one of the most memorable openings of any heavy metal song the drums are killer! Halford's vocals are ranged from high pitched to a mid yell (as any Judas Priest fan already knows). Second we have \\"Red Heat White Hot\\" Personally, I'm not too fond of this track, not too sure why maybe it will grow on me. It just seems like it drags on, although the solo is nice. \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\" is perhaps one of the best covers in heavy metal history. Absolutely love this track. Yes I know its a Spooky Tooth Cover but man does it rock. \\"Stained Class\\" comes next. I've never met a title track I didn't like and this is no exception. Halford's vocals rise to the sky with his classic heavy metal shrieks! The guitars are galloping and the drums are pounding. It has all the signs of a classic metal track. \\"Invader\\" is an odd track and progressive for the band at this time especially for 1978. \\"Saints In Hell\\" possibly the darkest song on the album musically. Rob's vocals are really high pitched on this track especially. Overall, its a half and half track for me. \\"Savage\\" starts off with Rob yelling back and forth but it is the slowest track off the whole album. \\"Beyond The Realms Of Death\\" is one of their best tracks. The intro is melodic and almost calm. Until Rob shrieks \\"YEAH!!\\" and we get some heavy metal riffs in the face thanks to the two men on guitar. This is possibly the best song off the whole album. \\"Heroes End\\" rounds out this album for a few. Rob's vocals are pretty tame compared to prior tracks and the riffs are quite melodic. The drumming is nice as well, Les Binks does a great job keeping the beat on this track. Overall, this is a classic heavy metal album from the early days. If you want to hear some of their earlier stuff check out Sad Wings Of Destiny. This isn't their best album but it is in the top three. A must have for any fan of metal.stuff check out Sad Wings Of Destiny. This isn't their best album but it is in the top three. A must have for any fan of metal.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Oliver Stone's Untold History is Compelling. He states up front that there are other places to read all that is good about the US. His purpose is to show that throughout our nation's history there have always been competing ideologies for how best to govern at home and conduct foreign policy abroad. These forces are with us today as  progressives are fending off attacks by the neo -conservatives over how we conduct war and peace.<br />As a fellow veteran of the Vietnam war, it is just amazing to read that throughout our history, according to Stone,  children of the working classes are sent off to fight wars that are generated by those elites who own and profit from international trade, and often the via exploitation of peoples of other, weaker nations. The facts are well documented and sourced and the reader is left with more information from which to raise questions about our past and more importantly about our present policies. It should be required reading by all high school students.
B0095P33IW|4.0|A friend of mine let me borrow his copy of the Avengers, and before watching it I wanted to see all of the other films in this series.  Captain America was an entertaining movie and definitely worth watching if you like the series.
B00APUTEBG|2.0|I'd say this is a 2 or 2.5 star film. even though bruce, segourney and henry are in it this is probably their worse performances I've ever seen. there is definately no schemistry beween any of the actors, they all seem like they are there just because. maybe it was the bad directing or what not but henry is a crap actor in this, hopefully he wont suck in man of steel
B00A757EFW|5.0|It brought back so many memories.  I used to love this game as a kid.  Love playing it.  I also love the fact that it plays without wifi.
B006ZN7KMM|4.0|Muy buena recopilación de reportajes. Dejan ver como era la mirada del mundo hace algunos años atrás. Se recomienda para quienes tengan interés de la visión hace 35 años atrás para adelante.
B00004XMTJ|3.0|I'm not sure why this has gotten so much attention over the years... make-up? wardrobe? I mean those are nice, I guess and I really do enjoy a few of the songs but overall, I think the musical itself is... remarkably forgettable.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Very funny movie. Have to have an open prespective in order to enjoy it. Watched it three times so far!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Oy vey, 20 words is a large &#34;word requirement&#34; for reviewing a book on Amazon. But I will say again what I said for the previous two books: It's a really good series. Check it out, you won't be sorry.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Once again Tommy Lee Jones gives a stellar performance.  This movie has a strong Hitchcockian atmosphere.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I finished the first book in this series and then immediately got this book and it doesn't disappoint. Really, really awesome!
B00821OX98|5.0|I was delightfully suprised by this show. We watched every episode wanting to just keep watching. Many times we watched 5 episodes or more in a row of this series. The characters are great, acting is great, all around a fantastic show.<br />I highly recommend this to anyone who likes shows such as &#34;the walking dead&#34;.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I have been devouring at a rapid pace all of the books in this series and while I still think this book is GREAT, I will say that the story-line slowed down a bit in this book. (in my opinion) All in all though, I still can't recommend this series highly enough to people. Simply awesome.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Liked it! it was good to watch! a great movie to watch when in the mood! I gatta find more like this one!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, I was hooked from start to finish and immediately bought, read and devoured the whole series.
B008K7WCJM|5.0|There really is no other album like it. Truly fantastic on every level. For the optimal experience, make sure you wear headphones and are prepared for a two hour experience of noise, beauty and aw.
B0095R64AO|2.0|Endearing and relevant premise.  So much to relate to.  So funny and charming.  Such warmth and quiet tension.  The humor potential was met and so nicely.  But all these makings of a memorable and enjoyable story were interrupted with rude and crudely unnecessary images.  Made something sweet and funny, intermittently turn ugly.  I felt flashed over and over.  These actors are so much more talented than that!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Emotionally charged and absolutely riveting. I couldn't put it down. The way Hoover draws you into the story, makes you feel what the characters feel makes it impossible to simply walk away without a resolution. It shows the very best and very worst of human nature, heart breakingly honest yet soul healingly hopeful. I believe I just found my new favorite author.
B002APU580|5.0|This did justice to the book.  Some of Mr. Bennett's quips were memorably straight from his dialogue in the book.  I love that.  It adds another dimension to those of us who watch movies (and remakes) made from the classic novels in order to enjoy the activity of compare and contrast.<br />Overall, this was warmer than the 1940 film.  Darcy and Lizzie were classy and intelligent but adorable in their aloofness.  I was glad to see them not appear \\"dear\\".  They're not \\"dear\\".  They are instead amused by watching the characters around them feign \\"dearness\\".  The original characters were perfectly conveyed.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Love love love it and its affordable and durable i just wish ill get another color next time and highly recommended to everyone that has kindle this size.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Such an unusual premise.  Such a great concept.  Intelligent.  I stayed with it and understood because I was compelled to get into the story.  Of course Bruce Willis nailed it.  A slightly paranormal John Wayne without cliche.  Lots of love and human sentiment that stirred me.  Love that requires drastic measures for the benefit of the loved ones is not easy to convey on screen with succinct dialogue and without dramatic washout.  Great flick.  It'll be a classic, and I'm up for the rerun already.
B00138D1RC|5.0|I think Nina is one of our treasures, and will always be! That's all the words I have, sorry I guess I need 8
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I fell asleep.  What does that tell ya.  And I can't listen to the film score because of what happened in Aurora.  I love movies, and I love Batman.  But I'm feeling brutally honest with this review.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved the production. It is soooo English. I am still having trouble receiving it without stops on my ipad
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Not as funny as the prequels.  These two make a great team on screen, though.  It's another installment.  Unfortunately;that's all.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|An amazing soundtrack from an amazing movie rendition! The whole family couldn't wait to get it and hear it again!
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Starts with a bang and then commiserates on loser drama.  We usually expect so much more from Denzel Washington's acting.  He is capable of so much more than this screenplay can possibly deliver.
B001TXQCEK|5.0|Dio's second solo album and it lives up to his first great solo album, Holy Diver. Dio's voice and Campbell's great guitar work backed by Appice, Bain and Schnell will have you rockin' out for some time. I bought this to replace my vinyl (which I bought back in the 80's) which I still have and I still love it.
B004X4QW42|4.0|I don't know how much of the story was actually true, but it was entertaining.  Great fight choreography, Sammo Hung is still awesome.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|This documentary reminded me of the two \\"Eddie and the Cruisers\\" films, only \\"Sugar Man\\" is better. Record Company Exec. Clarence Avant, who damns himself with his attitude and profanity, comes off as a lost soul. I would love to see Bob Dylan ask Sexto to tour with him. It would be great, but I don't see it happening.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Just not user friendly - does not go directly to what my needs are to much info - and not the specific info that I am looking for
B00821OX98|5.0|This has a great storyline throughout and at times can be emotional considering the setting of defending you and your family against invaders.  A must watch!
B001Q7JD3Q|3.0|I enjoyed the movie particularly the parts with Naomi Watts Dancing for Kong.  In the end however I was ready for the movie to be over before when they captured Kong.  I hung on and watched the New York section of the flick but I really wouldn't have missed much if they would have cut the movie right there.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It was very well written.  Always keeping the reader off balance.  It made you mad and broke your heart at the same time.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I did not know Prometheus was a prequel to &#34;Aliens&#34;.  I am way out of the loop these days.  Just came accross it on amazone and decided to rent it.  I liked being suprised by it being a prequel.  Many years ago I was an Aliens fan.  This was right on par with the original and added a neat new dimension to the story.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have this app on my phone as well as my kindle and it has never let me down. . . Except when the wifi is down. But otherwise, great app!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|At first I thought, &#34;what the heck&#34; and wasn't sure I made a good choice, but as the film went on it grew on me.  By the end I was very glad I rented the movie.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Love this movie and so does my daughter.  She had to have it for her 4th birthday.  Very whimsical with not as much Disney princess pink.
B0041CGP02|5.0|I ordered this for my cousin who is 11 and just lost her mom.  Music is helping her to grieve.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I  like. the. way. they. always keep. You.  On your. Feet.....me. nervous...this. show. Keep  get. better. and better. who. will. Be. Next
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was amazing, simply put. I could not put it down once I started. It was emotionally satisfying and made me take a closer look at the relationships in my life.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great series filled with everything from action and suspense to love and loss. It's a good read for all ages!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Awesome none stop action and lots of twists. I can't wait for the next Mitch Rapp book to come out.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Contains a cast of personable characters truly brought to life by the writer.  This cast is interwoven into a current case that sends them searching clues in events occurring years prior and had me guessing right along with them.  Mystery/Thriller fans should enjoy this one.
B00785P2QC|4.0|love being able to build my way and do the goals if I want to. not fond of having to wait on energy though.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Awesome  game to play it is free. And is fun. If you like adventure . You will like this game. I love the zipline.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great true story. well written.  wanted to know what this individual experienced.  Liked that the book was written by a well known MD.  He wrote his memories then researched.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|What an enjoyable book!  At times I was incredibly sad for the main character, and at times I was laughing out loud!  Christina McKenna has a knack for keeping the reader interested, for evoking the reader's sympathy, and for for creating a scene in the reader's mind that brings forth chuckles well after the book has been finished.
B007HLIUN4|4.0|Muy bueno y muy largo para agotarlo en una simple revisión. El autor tiene percepciones originales, como por ejemplo, en el papel que tuvo la religión en la superación del problema del gorrón (free-rider) y en las ventajas evolutivas que la misma concedió a ciertas sociedades. Definitivamente, estoy esperando el segundo tomo...
1451695187|5.0|I really found the book interesting from both the small knowledge of medicine explained and for the insight into people's faith in what is unseen. The most satisfying part of this story was the strengthening of hope that one will meet the deceased loved ones from their life on earth and have an eternal life in heaven.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|I am a Moody Blues fanatic...hooked on them since I was a young Marine in Vietnam. In fact, I will be seeing them in person March 8 in Albuquerque,NM at Rte 66 Casino . This will mark my 6th time for their concerts. Now to Justin's solo ;;;;I like it but think it will grow on me with time. I really did not know what to expect...I suppose most cuts are just so slow and laid back.Sorry, I still like the ORIGINAL Broken Dream fro View from the Hill.He is a fantastic artist solo or with his Moodies buddies. My favorite solo albums are his first SOMGWRITER and MOVING MOUNTAINS. The latter has never been properly released or promoted. I got it in 1998 via a friend telling me about..Must pay a hefty price even a Amazon subsellers,,,Should be re-release, or maybe in a Justin's Greatest solo box package. Anyway, he is still great and doing what he enjoys.I will most likely learn to love this album, but at first was a bit taken off guard by its sleepy presentation.
B0026772N8|5.0|it's a thought provoking book and a fun read.  want to know about life, this may help.  recommended it to my staff
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This was one of the better Bond films made. Daniel Craig once again shows that he is the best choice to play James Bond.
B009186JNO|4.0|This is a look at the Stones in the beginng when they played mostly the blues and they had all the original members witch included Brian Jones.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Awesome movie! Great action film! If you like heroes you'll love this one. Captain America will keep you wanting more.
B005KMX866|4.0|I enjoyed the discs because Chris did selections by some of his favorite artistists from the early fifties in Memphis.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The Downton Abbey Series is fabulous and I am so happy I was able to catch up on all the previous episodes so I'm in the know and caught up.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|This alarm app is amazing, but for one glaring flaw; it does not wake up and unlock the Kindle Fire HD. yes, you can hear the alarm and it ramps and plays whatever you want, etc. However, you have to wake up the device yourself (power button, swipe the unlock) to get to the wonderfully huge snooze button.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app is much better than the Apple ipad version.  My grand kids love playing it.<br />We have found some apps better on the ipad and then others better on the Kindle.<br />The Kindle does almost everything the ipad does at 1/3 the cost.  Of course both<br />are new and we are still learning our way around each; but am pleased with the Kindle.
0465011020|5.0|Loved this book from the outset.  Great story of life in North Korea.  Gives a fresh look at the real goings on across the DMZ.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|There is never any doubt where this story is heading.  But Eastwood and Adams make the journey pleasant enough, and I don't mind a little schmaltz with my popcorn. Clint plays his typical curmudgeon and Amy Adams is a delight as a daughter trying to develop a last minute relationship with the old man before he shuffles off this mortal coil.  Adams has really developed into a wonderful actress of surprising depth and complexity. I will see almost anything she does.  However, someday someone is going to explain to me what the virtue in promoting Justin Timberlake because... I really don't get it.  Marginal looks, marginal talent. There are so many talented and deserving young actors out there ya gotta wonder why this guy gets so much opportunity. But whatever -  he manages to walk through this film without injuring anyone.  But his contribution is - wait for it... strictly marginal.  But then again how can you expect such a weak personality to compete with the likes of Clint, Amy and the inimitable John Goodman.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I hadn't even heard of this book until my sister told me she was going to see the movie. I read the reviews and the Kindle sample - which is a joke because it doesn't even get to the book , just quotes from reviews - and decided to give it a try. Wow! I read it in one sitting, couldn't put it down. The story is told in an unusual style, and I think that's what makes it so intense. The reader feels intimately involved in the main character, Pat People's life and his quest to be reunited with his wife. Can he heal from his head injury and mental health problems and find a happy ending to the \\"movie of his life\\"? There's much more depth to this novel. You have to read it to find out.
B0091REZMW|3.0|not enough continueous things to seek and find. dont care about the story line. just looking for a game of search
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|💎💎💎💎  Best book I've ever read  💎💎💎  💎💎 💎💎  💎💎💎 💎💎💎💎 💎💎💎 💎💎💎 💎 💎 💎 💎 💎🚁 🚀 🌐
B002L3ARRU|5.0|I was so glad to find this movie on Amazon Prime! Ferris Bueller is as funny as ever, and the video quality was great. It might be a little slow if you have a bad connection, but overall I was very pleased.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I love how this app is just like using Facebook on the computer. I would recommend this to everyone that uses the kindle fire. Have no problems with it.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Finally getting to watch Game of Thrones Season 2 is amazing!! Been waiting months to get back into Westeros. Season 1 was great, season 2 was great and season 3 should be even better!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This movie great for both kids and kids at heart. A great family movie with humor that all can enjoy.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Love to play this game makes you think and grow your mind it's fun to I would recommend this game .
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was very helpful to me during school so I didn't miss words in class exams and that kind a stuffn
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|This is a connection app for people to get information about jobs and what your friends are doing like it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is amazing but It needs more updates. also it needs to have multiplayer so you can join other friends games on a different wifi. that would make the game a hole lot better
B00914JWSW|5.0|Does Barbara Streisand have any bad CDs? I don't think so. This is another great CD. I am glad I found this on Amazon and at a good price!
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|The creepiness was undeniable in the beginning of this film.  I have to admit, I was tempted to cover my eyes.  *****SPOILER ALERT****.  As soon as someone said &#34;Boogie man&#34; I could no longer take it seriously.  Good for a scare though!
B00000K2W1|5.0|I ordered this CD on a Friday and recieved it on the following Tuesday. Janis' music brings me back to the age of Aquarius and this is a great album of her greatest music!
B00005TQKQ|4.0|this was a good perchase for me because I had a hard time finding just the 8mm head cleaner, but with this you get them all. not bad.I haven't used it yet, but if i have any problems I will let you know
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Grace and Sam are characters you immediately fall in love with, and start rooting for their love to succeed. Great depth of characters by Stiefvater.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Excellent movie - very realistic - time flew by while watching it. Maybe the only questionable part was the chase down the runway since it appeared the cars could have cut across in front of the airplane tires and caused a problem of some kind - but maybe suicide actions weren't so popular back then.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Lots of fun. Funny movie good acting and interesting plot. Teen movie everyone will enjoy, fun. Want haha watch this movie
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Works great. Does exactly what you need, plays whatever you throw at it. I once wrote a 700 word essay and saved it in notepad on my computer, put it in MoboPlayer and it turned into Gone With The Wind. AMAZING!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great book!  I was a little disappointed with the ending, It was abrupt.  Maybe it will lead to a sequel!  I can only hope!

B007W1BLN0|5.0|Great story of an adventurous young man. Incredibly inspiring. Definitely worth watching over and over. The book is a great read as well.<br /><br />\\"The core of mans' spirit comes from new experiences.\\"

B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a nice little book. Very easy I get through and while predictable to a point, still enjoyable..  Would recommend it.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I enjoyed this book even more than &#34;Gone Girl&#34;.  The characters were fascinating and the plot was interesting.  It was difficult to put down.
B00932DCS8|4.0|This is worth the watch!<br />An intellegent film that gets a bit gorie.......but men will love it!<br />A typical Swedish flick.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|LOVE THIS SHOW!!!  I'm hooked already watched season 5 and ready for season 6.  So much happens in this season that you really need to watch all of it. Too much to write about.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this read/listen - very well written!  Some great, thought provoking themes - socioeconomic status, disability, quality/value of a life, etc.  Humor intertwined at appropriate times.  Highly recommend!
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Awesome.  Helpful. Please god I hope it helps me lose fat. Thanks for writing this Tim. Four more words required.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The action scenes were spectacular, as they have been in all the Daniel Craig 007s.  Craig is clearly a Bond for the current times.  He is as good in his way as Sean Connery was in his, and that is saying a lot.<br /><br />The move to reset key characters was largely a success, with a return to the original concept of M and Miss Moneypenny being better than the trendy, nerdy Q change, on which I reserve judgement.<br /><br />The retro aspects, reminding us that Bond is about heart, determination, loyalty and duty worked pretty well. Re-introducing the old Aston-Martin and then destroying it was a bit over the top, but OK.  The idea that Bond had an ancestral home and some dark secrets in his youth seems a bit unnecessary.  Bond is not about psychological dilemmas and will lose his charisma if that aspect of modern movie-making is introduced into Craig's physical, willful, ruthless Bond.<br /><br />The big weaknesses in this movie are the villain and the Bond girl.  These two traditional elements were not handled as well as in past Bond movies.  Javier Bardem is capable of creating a 1st class villain, as the Coen brothers' No Country for Old Men clearly showed.  Here, we must simply accept his prowess.  He does very difficult things off camera, but nothing on camera to make us believe he is Bond's equal.  The Bond girl is too complex, too vulnerable, too multi-cultural and too briefly sketched to care about.  Not even Bond cares about her.<br /><br />While this movie is all about justifying the end of the old M and seducing us into a reset of the main characters without jarring our feelings about the overall series, it needed a better plot.  Much of what happened in this movie is too unbelievable.  The Bourne series got the feel of the &#34;evil but necessary&#34; spy agency right.  As a result, we believe the unbelievable things both the CIA and Bourne do.  Here, MI6 is simply a caricature.  That weakens the believability of the plot and motivates us to think aboutwhy characters behave as they do.<br /><br />All in all, a satisfying segue, but more a prelude than a stand-alone symphony.  The next 007 will need to be very good if momentum is not to be lost.

0307591549|4.0|I love Shawn Achor's Ted Talk.  One of my absolute favorites.  This book is a good companion to the Ted Talk, but has a lot of overlap.  It is very easy to ready and understand.  I also appreciate how much his views are supported by good research and fun stories and examples.  If you like or love the Ted Talk, the book is worth your time, just will not grab you the same way the Ted Talk did the first time you watched it.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Very good attention to detail on what a person goes through when diagnosed with dementia. As a SLP who works with dementia pts I was impressed. Opens your eyes to the struggles with communication.
0345472322|5.0|This book was very powerful to read.  The concept of Mindset, supported by research, is very important to consider as a manager, educator, and parent.  The book is a bit repetitive, but by the end you understand the concept fully.  If you want to help your kids, students, or employees focus on getting smart instead of trying to look smart, give this book a try.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|What a delicious journey in the dark with this gorgeous album SPIRITS OF THE WESTERN SKY I just digitally downloaded. Most of the love songs (especially the spellbinding The Western Sky) are so very moving, it's unsettling ! And then just when you think you are emotionally spent, the last two tracks find you boogie-ing right out of your chair. This album will grab hold of your soul and not let go; you are powerless ! Justin is a magic man ! I need to go learn how to breathe regularly again now. Nite...or very good morning it surely is ... Pamela Baker in NY
B0064X7FVE|4.0|When they leave politics out, which isn't often, the Weather Channel is pretty good.  Like knowing it's available if needed.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very addictive game. Love the visuals and a very smooth playing game. Would like to have an option to change the look of the deck...just an idea.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I have read articles that this works and read articles that it's bogus.  It gives me peace of mind thinking at least it's something!  If it only works once, it was worth it!
B000FVQLRA|5.0|Wonderful movie. Truly keeps your interest. We have watched it three times so far. A must have. Wish I had seen this in the theatre.
B0086700CM|5.0|I like it, a few misswipes but over all great game, for free.  I'm not a gamer, but this is the first game I tried on my new devices, so I would have something available if in a wait period situation.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|judging by the previews I thought that It would be funnier than it was. Kind of disappointed, but other than that It was okay. Nothing outstanding  or really bad. Just okay.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|The original movie was so much better.  There was no character development and the plot was weak and uninteresting.  Dredd never takes off his helmet.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  You should read this book I have to start the next book
B00BHMF578|5.0|The bravery shown by Afflecks character and all the terrified potential POW's is an inspiration to all Americans.  Government service in the diplomatic corps is not for the feint of heart.  This movie brings the message of that bravery and dedication to a population rapidly loosing sight of our United condition and those heros who must face death and worse daily.
0525953728|5.0|Someone told me to read the book before seeing Zero Dark Thirty. I am glad I did because it made understanding the movie much easier. The accuracy between the movie and the part of the book describing the Osama mission was very high. Either the author helped or someone else gave a very similar story.<br /><br />This book show a totally different perspective than the movie though. It is from the Navy Seals viewpoint and not the CIA viewpoint the movie uses. Everything about the Seals from selection, training, and first hand description of many additional missions prove to be very fascinating and hard to put down. I found a new understanding of the thinking process and adrenalin pumped excitement that goes with every mission. No wonder it is hard to retire and find civilian life tolerable.<br /><br />This book gave me new respect to the meticulous and thorough training our men go through in order to serve to our country and allow so many of us the wonderful freedom to live daily without fear of terrorist attacks.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very personal in depth revelation of feelings, experiences, and dedication to their fellow warriors. Unless we've been in a similar circumstance, we don't fathom the life they've lived during the action AND the penalities they experience after. By reading this book we,at least, begin to understand. The book also reveals the sacrifices the families and loved ones pay forever. I read the book immediately after Chris Kyle's death. Ironically, he was killed by another fellow veteran he was guiding through recovery from PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder). We owe our service men and women the best treatment possible as they attempt to create a new life for themselves and their families.
B004SCY41W|5.0|Good deal of introspection, and reflection.  The book arrived on time.  This is part of class reading for a high schooler.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Kindle fits in securely.  Method of propping Kindle up at an angle works well in landscape view (as advertised) but doesn't have that option in portrait.  The texturing is only on one side of the case.  The only things I don't like may be more of an issue with the Kindle design.  You need to remove the Kindle or leave the case open to charge because the power jack is on the inside fold of the case.  The case is designed to have the camera to your right, but some apps that only display in portrait mode require you to hold the case &#34;upside down&#34;.  I have no regrets about this purchase.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Purchased this CD of Katy's and absolutely love it! I had heard most of her songs on the radio, so I knew this one was a great selection of some of my favorite tunes by Katy. She is so very talented, and beautiful, listening to her songs really puts you into a great mood. You will not be disappointed with this CD that's for sure. \\"Best Party Ever!\\" Go Katy!<br />[[ASIN:B006XBSAP2 Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection]]

B003UYUP58|5.0|This is a good book, and anyone seeking to understand the basics of cancer and its history should pick it up.

B0015AARJI|5.0|muy buen control al igual que el original que viene incluido con el equipo gran control y buen precio es el mejor.
0425252868|5.0|To me this book is less about the details of WWII and more about devotion to duty, a belief in humanity, values and commitment.  War is basically an indescribable horror that often brings out the worst in people but very often brings out the best.  A Higher Call is a wonderful story about how two enemies met after the war and became friends.  As I read this book I had a recurring thought:  Are we really different from our enemies(excluding the fanatics on both sides)? I don't believe we are...our soldiers, airman and seaman had the same fears, had families had a life not much different than their counterparts and both sides were defending their country.  It is very heartwarming that shared values, in the end, brought two former enemies together as friends.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very happy with the app.  Easy to use and understand.<br /><br />Liked it better then my regular calculator plus it's part of my kindle so I don't need another gadget when paying bills.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Great graphics!  This movie is funny and full of great animation!  Was worth the wait! Definitely one of my animated favorites!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought the writing was superb, with good twists as the book went along.  It compels me to read Gillian Flynn's other books.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book. Kept me very interested. Loving the way she had the chance to get a baby but put the love they had for each other first and makeing the best love child they can make
1616550414|5.0|It's such an awesome book, absolutely EVERYTHING you want to know about LoZ!!  I love the timeline and the chronology, and all the artwork that has never been seen before!  And it's only $20,  it's a great buy for any fan!
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|When i first saw one time, i didn't like the song or him. But that change when I heard Never Say Never and i became a fan. Justin grew so much as a person and a artists. I like believe acoustic so much better than believe because it  raw and it shows his talent. I am very proud of him.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This CD is very clear and colorfull.  The sound was great and the picture quality was all that you could ask for.I liked the setting of the film and the comedy portions.  It was an eye opener on life in the south for many who were black.
0765325950|3.0|First, let me say, ignore all those 1 star reviews because the LARGE majority of them have to do with people being ticked off about no e-book version.  Get over it.  Reviews are to rate the product, not to rant and rave about how the product is released. If you don't want to pay for the book, then wait until the e-book does come out and shut the hell up until then.  Now, for the book review......I know this was the Last Battle, but sorry.....WAY too much time spent on boring battle strategy and seeing how many ways we could describe a trolloc dying.  We get it already.  I'm going to try not ruin any of the book for anyone, but bad things happen to good people, bad things that really didn't need to happen for the book to function.  It's like he killed people off just to be doing it.  I admit, I read the ending when I was only about 1/2 thru the book because I HAD to know who lived and who died.  I will say....I'm surprised at how many long-standing characters did survive. I invested a lot of time and years in this series, and I'm a sucker for a happy ending and I actually don't feel this was one.  Also, some of the characters that were prominent in past books were either barely in this one, or not mentioned at all.  Morgase for one.  Her name was mentioned once, and her \\"boyfriend\\" Tolliver not at all.  Moiraine----well, sad job incorporating her.  Why even bother to bring her back to life??  I would have enjoyed more on Mat and Tuon's relationship and how it functioned.  What was there was odd. Perrin's whole wolf plot got old about 3 books ago.  And honestly, if you stand back and think, Rand, who this whole series revolved around, was really in this book very little.  I did enjoy Androl and Pevera, and I always enjoy Mat's humor (I don't get those who say BS got Mat's character wrong----I actually liked him better than RJ's original Mat who I mostly wanted to punch). Overall, I think the book could have been a much better ending to the series had it been shorter with way less battle scenes and more focus on what was going on with individuals and how it all fit together. And really, the way things ended for Rand/Dark One was a cop out.ith way less battle scenes and more focus on what was going on with individuals and how it all fit together. And really, the way things ended for Rand/Dark One was a cop out.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|Stevie Nixs on this album is the greatest and it truly is one of Fleetwood Mac's greatest hits.  I have to say I still love them.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|If you like serious, mature fantasy, this is for you. It's less about the socery and swordplay, and more about the conflicts between flawed people and struggling nations. The many characters are well-developed and complex, originating from differing backgrounds, nations, races, religions and political constructs. I found it refreshing that the author seemed to refuse to take sides with any of the characters; good and evil is exposed in them all, and found myself constantly changing allegiances. The history of the nations and ruling families of this series overwhelms me at times. However, I got used to it and stopped trying to understand every nuance.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|The song is much better than it's movie.<br />I watched the movie because of this song<br />Adele did her best at this song

B008MIMWOO|5.0|Got this trio at an amazing price!!  We have watched them countless times already!! Has become a family favorite instantly.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Each episode is action and intrigue filled by itself.  But it also has an over-arching storyline that just keeps getting more and more interesting.  The main characters are fascinating, and always evolving.  Anna Torv as the main character (Olivia Dunham) is quite a revelation.  Granted, my wife and I just started watching this show, and we're now still four seasons behind, but I hope we start seeing her in other efforts.  I really like Sci-Fi, and my wife isn't crazy about it, but we both really enjoy the show.  It took us a while to get to it, but it's never too late to join the fun!
B008TMA1LY|1.0|My 4 yr old daughter loves this game! Too bad the game allows her to purchase more coins at a charge of $19.99. We had to delete the game and request a refund.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|If you're looking for marketing &#34;techniques&#34;, etc. you won't necessarily find them here. This isn't a &#34;How to write killer emails for your next campaign.&#34; Instead it's a thoughtful look into how sales has changed, and how we all must respond to that change if we are to survive in a job or as a business owner.<br /><br />As we move from information asymmetry (like when the used car dealer knew everything about the lemon he was selling, but you know only what he tells you) to information parity (now you can walk into the dealership knowing as much as the dealer about that car because of the internet) motivations have changed. Pink says we've moved from caveat emptor the caveat venditor. One bad customer experience ends up in a tweet that reaches hundreds if not thousands instantly.<br /><br />Pink is an engaging writer, and if you read the research he offers up throughout the book to support his claims, you'd get a pretty good education in the process.<br /><br />This book is a great follow up to Drive.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|All the additions work well.  It is still temple run with a more challenging feel.  A must have if you liked the first game.
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|I am a huge megadeth fan. I have the original album and the remixed and mastered one as well. I bought this specifically for the live album which is a must have. Some of the tracks they play on it you can't hear live anymore or are very very rare and these are GREAT quality.<br /><br />The main album sounds crisp, not heavily edited and no loudness tweaks. The added poster is nice too, but I wish it was a standard 3 x 5.<br /><br />If you are a fan, you likely already have it and may be apprehensive about getting it- Don't be. Get the live cd for you and give the other cd to someone who needs more metal in their life!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a magnificient, enthrallling series...wonderfully complex storyline, rich characters, both dramatic and humorous...at the end of each episode, you will find yourself waiting breathlessly for the next!
B009B8YZIK|4.0|A Halo movie is something that hardcore fans of the series and extended fiction have always wanted, and while this isn't exactly something you'd be glad you paid for to see in theaters it IS fun to watch. The story is slow at first and ramps up nicely towards the end. The acting is good, the CG effects are or and overall it is a solid entry into the universe.<br /><br />Still, most would prefer a CGI movie that was able to show more of the Covenant and the greater aspects of the war, but that requires Microsoft to play ball with HollyWood which they refuse to do and which I applaud them for.<br /><br />If you are a fan that reads the books and really likes the story, you should watch this. If not, you may not enjoy it as much.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Scary as hell!!!!!!!! Do not play in the dark or with a friend who is a jerk. Do not turn around.
B00304RMFE|3.0|This is a mixed bag for most fans. I would wager that everyone will be able to find at least ONE story they really like, but may not enjoy the others.<br /><br />The stories aren't &#34;bad&#34; it just that its done in an Anime art style and the writing caters to Japaneses audience. Its full of stereotypes. I wish the stories weren't cannon to Halo's lore but....oh well.<br /><br />I like The Duel and origins. The others didn't resonate with me. Your results may vary. If you can get it for $10, do it. Otherwise, you aren't missing much.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved season 3 and can't wait for season 4 to begin!  Although, that being said, I am not happy with the choice to kill off one of my very favorite characters.  I won't name any names here for fear of ruining the finale for anybody who hasn't seen it yet.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|Bought this as a gift for a friend. She liked it and has had no problems with it. Would recommend to friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This Game is so fun and exciting! I love it! It is totally worth waiting for to down load!! So addicting!<3
B000063DHL|4.0|I'm a metal fan but just now giving Iron Maiden a listen. Heard a lot of these songs on pandora so I decided to get this album as I liked more than 1/2 the songs played on it.<br /><br />Worth it!
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was an interesting book and a different plot.  But at times, I had to agree with my brother that it was &#34;just plain wierd&#34;  I probably could have lived without it because I didn't think it was worth the hype.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I like the game except when you get into the game then you have to buy the game what's up.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I'm still in the middle of this one, but find Ken Follet's books very readable and enjoyable.  Wait until I finish it.; I'm still reading.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|Really liked this movie. From the beginning; this movie is full of surprises-good ones. It is both very funny and touching. I could have done with a lot less cursing; however. Loved the singing throughout the movie. Did not like the format it was delivered in. The delivery format was a collapsed 16.9. Really didn't like that. Having seen the movie before; most of the movie I watched was very compressed. Most of the details and a lot of the movie are hard to see or lost. Buy the dvd to really see this movie; worth seeing. Just be careful with viewing-does contain a lot of cursing.
B00BGZ8OLA|1.0|Very depressing,kept freezing I have never had this issue with Netflix . Very dissatisfied and a very bad choice had I known it would keep freezing I never would have made the purchase
B000I9U9A4|5.0|Once i a while a compelling story is set to the stage of the open seas. This is one of them! The characters, courage, and realistic scenes really touched me. A classic.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Everything about this purchase served my purposes. It protects splendidly, allows the propping up of the Kindle both vertically and horizontally, and I have had no inconveniences. Excellent all around!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|You should include that it's only the Pilot - which I thought I was renting- now find out I'm paying for TV passes for Seasons that supposedly can stream free as a Prime member.  Any episode I missed on actual TV, I streamed from CBS, not knowing, perr Amazon's Customer Service, I'm supposed to be able to watch this FREE???  Is this saying the whole Season 1 is in my Video library?
B0097C8XL0|5.0|cause this game is like temple run but cutest 1. you are a Penguin 2. not in a temple on icebergs.3. not being chased 4. octopi insted of monkeys
B0058ZPNOK|5.0|I never heard of this before I bought this movie, just purchased it because I like the actors in it.  It turned out to be enjoyable in more ways than one.  There are a few stories going here in an odd way, that somehow seem totally unrelated yet have an effect on another.  I like all the known actors and the way they play their roles except for J Gordon -Levitt's role.  I usually like him in any movie but feel he either never lived like Hesher or anyone remotely like that - however he still makes the role interesting and his character very likeable as whacked as he (Hesher) is. Natalie Portman never disappoints - she did well here, even though this was a small part, it was a relevant one and as any other film, she plays it to the hilt.  Fishboy, sorry that's the only way I remember him aside from The Office-  played a character I never imagined he could or would and did it well.  I don't recall seeing Piper Laurie in her younger days, just know OF her - but enjoyed her acting in this film.  I was very surprised at my reaction to the ending.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|The superb musicianship and songwriting of \\"Grace for Drowning\\" has returned once again in \\"The Raven Refused to Sing,\\" the third solo release by Porcupine Tree frontman, Steven Wilson. The record consists of six tracks (stories if you will) that focus upon supernatural and occult themes. It bears all the hallmarks that one would associate with a Wilson inspired album: top-notch production, haunting lyrics, psychedelic textures, and innovative song structures. But this record, much like \\"Grace for Drowning,\\" is confirmation that Wilson has settled into a new groove as a songwriter and into a new, minimized role as a performer.<br /><br />Despite bearing his name, this album is much less about Wilson the performer and much more about the artistic lineup surrounding him: Adam Holzman (keyboards), Theo Travis (winds), Nick Beggs (bass), Guthrie Govan (guitar), Marco Minneman (drums), and Alan Parsons (production). It was recorded in live band sessions at East-West Studios specifically to capture a vintage production sound and the spontaneous energy of improvisation. Like his prior release, Wilson has disposed of past metal textures for less scripted songwriting with jazz inspired passages. He composes without adhering to his personal capabilities as a performer; these songs are far more musically ambitious than much of the Porcupine Tree catalog or his first solo release, \\"Insurgentes\\".<br /><br />The results are simply extraordinary. \\"Luminol\\" and \\"The Holy Drinker\\" are groove-driven, longer pieces that will certainly please the headbangers in the crowd. Holzman and Travis' solos on these are just dynamite. The other tracks are generally more subdued, melancholic works replete with gorgeous lyrical and instrumental passages, especially \\"The Watchmaker\\", a personal favorite. Refer to some of the other reviews for more track-specific details. The end result is a stunning, musically diverse album that sits right up alongside \\"Grace for Drowning\\" as one of Wilson's finestefforts to date.<br /><br />For an artist as prolific, mercurial, and active as Wilson, it is amazing that he can deliver records of such quality within seemingly impossibly short time frames. After all, \\"Grace for Drowning\\" was only released in September 2011. Not to mention his work with Blackfield, No-Man, Bass Communion, Storm Corrosion, et al. Where and when does Wilson come up with this phenomenal stuff? Who knows? As long as he keeps turning out albums like this one, we all have much to look forward to in the future!<br /><br />9.5/10
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|ok, but not as good as the previous... I think this series has now run its course. Please, no #5
B005DNBDXM|5.0|Love Robert Duval and Morgan Freeman!!  I found the acting wonderful -  no superheros!  The story line is believeable.  Very thought provoking as to what I would do in the same circumstance.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is a great coming of age story, but I felt that some of the topics were inappropriate for my 12 year old daughter for whom I was pre-reading the book.  Though some topics were difficult, they were presented well and within a context that would give an opportunity for learning new perspectives without a loss of innocence.  It is a book that I will recommend to my daughter, but I will wait another year or two.  I read the Kindle version and had instant delivery with no problems whatsoever!

B003U4UNPK|5.0|If you haven't seen the series your in for a treat.  The greatest part is you don;t have to wait to see the next episode, however, if you need to get to work in the morning you should limit yourself to 3 episodes a night.  Its totally addictive!
B008602KQI|3.0|As with most movies based on a book, the book is greatly better. In this movie things were dramatically different than the book. Things were left out. If you haven't read the book this movies will be good.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|Lost is one of the best shows I have ever watched.  Do a LOST marathon, its great :) but certainly addictive
B000XZ3YH8|1.0|it was kinda flimsy the wires kept coming off and my daughter didnt like to play with it any more after her having to ask to string them over and over.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This is a great product. I love to use it frequently. I'm glad I was able to get this for myself.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I was worried I wouldn't enjoy a third one but it was great! I was happy the origional two were still in this one. I am glad we rented it!
B000NI8F5G|5.0|This is a great product. I love to use it frequently. I'm glad I was able to get this for myself.
B00336C3EY|5.0|A Serious Man, is a fantastic portrail of Jewish culture in the upper mid-west during the late sixties. The main character, Larry Gopnik, is in constant crisis from the myriad of troubles that placate his existence. Michael Stuhlbarg, who many have been able to enjoy recently in Lincoln and MIB3, perfectly encapsulates the feeling of loneliness and desperation. The film has a wicked sense of humor, and dares to to tread (at times) into the existential, which can be challenging but makes for a great conversation. Especially, when considering the film's meaning, one can watch the film many times and still not arrive at a safe conclusion, and this is the case without the film being avant-garde in anyway. The blu ray looks fantastic, as most of the Coen Brothers films do.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows, and I loved being able to see the episodes earlier than expected -- especially for such a low cost.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Just a great story line.  I can never stay interested in a book, and this one i sure did lol.
B000A6T262|5.0|This is a great product. I love to use it frequently. I'm glad I was able to get this for myself.
B0085OELXK|2.0|Boring.  Slow.  Predictable. Saving graces?  Great Italian scenery, which you might as well concentrate on as the movie doesn't deseve that much attention.  Even with his subtefuge I still don;t see why they woiuld becomne freinds with Matt Damon's charchter considering he came across as a stupid twit.  Mr. Damon is a good actor so it must have been the directors perception of the role.  Overall a waste of time.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This is a book that may not appeal to everyone and that is what made it a good book club choice.  The story of a reclusive man who sets out on a walking journey meeting people along the way that in actuality is a story of dealing with grief.  Good discussion book.
B0068THAGY|5.0|This is an interesting and fun movie.  I liked it very much.  It's also another &#34;Alien&#34; style movie with a monster that's a clone, like they all now seem to be, of the beasty in, &#34;Alien&#34;.  The p[re teen main charachters are well acted and the roles are played well.  This movie has the absolute best, a magnificent best train wreck.  The special effects are fantastic.  The thing that always bothers me about these movies is how does a creature thats all fangs and claws and drooling melted KY jelly ever develp the technology to build inter stellar spaceships?  They don't even have hands, never mind opposed thumbs!  Well, this one did, it got here, and it turns out it just wants to go home.  Good action packed fun movie for an escapist.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Mitch Albom never disappoints.  Having read his other books they do seem to run on the same theme.  It did make a good book club choice with different opinions making for a good discussion.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|The &#34;Black Box&#34; compares favourably with other Harry Bosch novels by Michael Connelly. The book keepsone involved and is hard to put down.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|very good I liked the movie but your review process should be limited to the stars not writing a review
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This is well-done and an interesting story.  Not many out there that are about tracking down a musician.<br />After seeing this I wonder what happened that Rodriguez never &#34;made it&#34;....management?  promotion? discrimination?
B00555X8OA|5.0|This is one of those books which everyone ought to at least know about, if not read in its entirety. The analysis it provides can help all of us to think more clearly, effectively and independently.
B0020TS5LK|2.0|Ok the ONLY reason this gets even 2 stars is because it is the actual movie, and Blade is effing awesome, BUT I think this is the Canadian version(french credits/synopsis on box yet film in English, also only other language is French). So I dont know the deal with Canadian special features but there are none. I remember getting Blade on dvd many years ago and there being at least some special features with alternate endings and such. The only reason I buy Blu-rays and DVDs is for the special features. If I wanted to JUST watch the movie in HD I would use less than legal means and watch it for free.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best game ever you should all get this app I hope it's five stars.so get this app today.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|whether you're in middle school, high school, or college, evernote lets you take clean notes. orders notes by date and shows the title and subject clearly.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I got this app on my iPhone and let me tell you, it is a very fun game!! Concept is very simple. You build your park and make your dinosaurs. As you progress, you unlock more dinosaurs and you even unlock an underwater Jurassic Park! What I live BEST about this app is the fact that you don't need to spend any money at all to have fun!!!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|The surprise trio of Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro, and Jennifer Lawrence couldn't be more sensational in this feel good comedy of the year featuring a couple of crazy people falling in love. This dysfunctional family composed of an obsessive compulsive father, his bi-polar son, and the long suffering mother holding them together couldn't have been portrayed more perfectly, or been more expertly acted. Silver Linings Playbook is sweet, sometimes endearing, hilarious, heart warming, at certain points relatable (in a strange way), and in the end it's triumphant. If you missed it in theaters, don't pass it up when it comes to dvd.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I really would have liked to see them do more with Nathan. I would really like to see Eva be able to confront him.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I just got my kindle fire he and this is the most fun, easy to use game I have so far. Good for killing time and trying to beat your previous times and scores.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book more in depth than I ever expected. I love how they go above an beyond with their imagination
B007FG9LIE|4.0|When the book started off, i was just trying to guess where it was all going, but then half way through the book, a major twist comes in. which raises the expectations and also the momentum, leading to a very surprising climax. A short and simple language, with no complications. Never thought it would turn out into a science fiction.<br /><br />Reading this author for the first time and am mighty impressed. Highly recommend to be read!
B0044C5SCU|4.0|excellant production and acting and story line. Scenes are well set up and presented. Sound and visual effects are also well done
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Whoever likes to know the inside story of baseball - how teams are put together and how vast amounts of money are allocated -- has to read this one. Michael Lewis is the great explainer of our time.  Nobody explains complexities as well as he does.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Pretty clean movie with only slight sexual overtones. It was nice watching a simple movie set in a simpler period.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|Voters who hate Obama and say he is a mystery to them should simply read this book, an honest and revealing book by a young man who was destined for big things.  Very few politicians provide such an insight into themselves before they seek our votes.  And that is the reason perhaps that not enough voters read these books when they come along.<br /><br />This book and Obama's previous memoir place him in the company of earlier Presidents who had a credible literary career overlapping their political careers.
B00821OX98|5.0|Didn't think I'd like a show about alien invasion, but it is very well done. The story touches very human plot lines I enjoy -- freedom, tyranny and group dynamics involving trust, leadership and power.
B000N2HBSO|3.0|A chapter or two of Goodwin's book is said to be the basis for Spielberg's Oscar-nominated film &#34;Lincoln.&#34;  It's also probably the motivation for President Obama to select Hilary Clinton as Secretary of State. Like Lincoln, Obama was willing to work with a political rival in his new administration.  Goodwin's book gives (too much) detail about Lincoln's rivals before he reached the White House and describes how he selected them for his cabinet in a move that was apparently very successful for him and the nation.  Unfortunately, after a while, you feel as if the author is dictating her notes to you, faster than you can absorb them.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|This sequel was watchable and entertaining, but fell short of the original. I will say the production values are much better, since the original was done in the '70's. I'd recommend it to friends, though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was great and I can't wait to start the next. I'm not much of an avid reader, nor a reader of this type of topic. I'm a chick lit kind of girl. I was pleasantly surprised how I could put the book down. I really  it in only a few days. Interesting story with an awkward love story mixed it. Read it you will like it.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Highly recommended. Movie HD video quality was C- at best.  Audio was very good.  And the film is classic Bond!
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Paired with ASRock z75 board for a home server.  Very fast for that application.  Using a kill-a-watt meter, the system draws just over 30 watts at idle with this cpu.  Excellent choice for desktops and servers where overclocking isn't a requirement.  Had used AMD for years and wanted to try intel.  Hard for me to tell a difference but this is a great CPU.
B0050XFYNA|4.0|This story, as startling to our sensibilities as it may be, is nonetheless believable (the sexual attraction between twins) and compelling.  The actors are physically attractive, but the nudity brief and appropriate.  The plot move slowly with the camera lingering on individual scenes longer then we  in the US are used to.  The transitions between scenes (blank screens) are unsophisticated, and a little jarring.  The cinematography is excellent.  The family is obviously upper middle class, well educated but still surprisingly liberal and broad minded about how their children develop sexually.  I think the movie portrayed an ideal world that we aspire to, not the world that we live in.  A feel good movie for those of us in the LGBT community.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is not only a great Bond film, its a great film.  If you have ever liked a Bond movie, buy this and Casino Royale(The new one)  They are the 2 best ones ever made.  This does for Bond what Christopher Nolan did for Batman.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Any Bond is a good show, but this one is a pretty dark story, and not one of my favorites.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the show! Love the characters! Casting is fantastic. I think Carson is my favorite!  I like the ongoing shenanigans of Thomas and Mrs Obtien.  Looking forward to Seson four!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The cast is amazing but more importantly the story line is such that you are always anxiously waiting for the next episode....and at season's end........is like waiting for......ever!!!!!
B005HEPIDS|5.0|The only problem with this season is that it seemed a little rushed (kind of like the end of Enterprise) and you wish the series could have gone on for another season. Other than that the stories are fun and true to the characters. It answered most of the lingering questions people had that could or should have been answered in a last season. Well done and easy to watch.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Ben Affleck and George Clooney made a movie that was entertaining, historical, interesting, and intense.  I was on the edge of my seat even though I knew the end result. It deserved to win best film of the year.
B000UZQI0Q|4.0|I really didn't think that I would find another group of characters that I loved as much as the WoT crew, but Sanderson created them with Vin, El, Breeze, Ham, Dockson, Clubs, Spoon and, most especially, Sazed. Well done!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This movie is the in the running for the best number one James Bond movie of all time. Really enjoyed it!
0375842209|5.0|I read at least two books a week, sometimes more. Many I like, some I hate, a few I love, and even fewer than that, grip my heart and leave a mark. Just finished The Book Thief and it falls into that last category. In some of it's own closing words: \\"I wanted to ask how the same thing could be so ugly and so glorious, and its words and stories so damning and so brilliant.\\"
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Denzel Washington should have won the academy award for his performance. I forgot I was in a movie and could feel his pain in every scene. If anyone you know is an alcoholic or drug addict it is a must see.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle's story is repeated every day by brave young soldiers who are wounded physically and mentally. A must read  for everyone who's freedom is paid for by these fine soliders. Thank you and rest in peace Chris.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Could not put this book down. Great from beginning to end. Kept me guessing the whole way through what was happening.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Poignant at times. Human foible funny at times. Uncomfortable at times. Just the thought of being trapped in an iron box...<br /><br />A movie you will not forget easily
B00BHMF578|5.0|Was interesting and fun to watch. I'm glad it won best picture. They did a good job with the story.
0060594896|5.0|Jack Canfield and all of his work never cease to inspire and motivate me while at the same time giving me practical ways to make changes now that will dramatically improve the quality of my life.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|Wonderful classic that is very close to the story. The characters are perfect for their roles. Entertaining and well done.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Gary does a fantastic job of explaining why a low or no carb diet works. I knew that carbs were a key part of the weight loss process, but never knew why. Now I do. I've been following his advice for the past month and half. I've been losing weight and I feel great.<br /><br />Sometimes they writing is a bit clunky, but the golden advice in here definitely outweighs any shortcomings! I highly recommend this book!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A fun, fast paced science fiction novel written mostly as journal entries by a strandd astronaut (the martian). Highly recommend!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone that likes a good story that has an ending.  The characters are fun and interesting and the scenery and settings are beautiful.  I even enjoyed checking out the attire of the actors and actresses.
0765325950|5.0|Personally i enjoyed Sanderson's writing style much more compared to Jordans (yes i know that people might take offense to that) It's much less wordy and repetitive and also much more amusing at times, especially any time there is bantering between characters.<br /><br />One thing i enjoyed about this book was the willingness to let characters die. The thing i was afraid of was every major character somehow surviving what should be the most epic battle of humankind, which would have been absolutely stupid if it had occurred. There were some nice twists here and there that kept the plot from being predictable which was very enjoyable too.<br /><br />People are always gonna be disappointed when an epic series ends, especially if it doesn't match how they feel it should go. You can't satisfy everyone though, and I for one, thought the ending was quite well done.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|i dont read alot of romance novels because there isnt a story line. if there were no sex scenes it would still be a great book.
B002ZG9968|5.0|This was truly a great movie. At some points it was funny and at others it was serious. Jennifer Lopez did an amazing job on this movie! It's one of my favorites!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|My husband, son and I all love Firefly.  It has quirky characters, interesting plot developments and humor.  The only minus is that it was cancelled so soon.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Beatifully written songs matched with a voice that just keeps getting better all the time.  I highly recommend it to anyone especially those who have never listen to Josh Groben before because they will be in for a pleasant surprise.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Definitely a page turner. I couldn't put the book down. I recommend this book to those who enjoy love, loss, and suspense.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is a fun game. It reminds me of my youth and I love it. What away to remember being young.<br />What a great memory game!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book series; it was one of the best I read. The books are descriptive and keep you interested!
B00BECZPI0|5.0|I have followed this show forever so it only gets better and better with time. Theseries I intriguing.<br />in everyway. Youjust got to see it for yourself so you can see what an awesome show it is too!
B006ATJXQW|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely.  It held my interest throughout and I could easily picture all the happenings in my mind.  I would recommend this book for a good read to anyone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My sons love this game and so does my neices and my nephew. They all enjoy playing all the Temple Run<br />Games a lot.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|I was curious about the collapse of the banks in the late 2000s, so I turned to Michael Lewis, who I know can tell a great story. I was not disappointed. With his Wall Street background, Lewis was a natural to tell this tale. This book is a page-turner, for sure.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love this new Facebookmail app. This is convient in everyway I really enjoy this app alot. Thank you<br />So much.
B000FC1PNE|4.0|I loved that this story included the poor Penelope from the previous books, I loved her quick wit and kindness and it is really showcased in this book.  It is also nice to really get to know the fun loving rake Colin and see the depth of his character.  Their story is one I will save.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|Matt Damon is amazing as Jason Bourne. If you like good writing, non-stop action, and suspense right up to the end of the movie, this is the movie for you.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|\\"The Raven\\" is a Prog masterpiece. Steve Wilson continues to follow his own muse, which perhaps disapoints some long-time Porcupine Tree fans, but delights those who recognize that his is a rare talent indeed who needs the freedom to explore musically, artistically and aurally. He has taken his third \\"solo\\" project into the stratosphere by engaging a cast of progressive music luminaries and challenging them to unite and bring their diverse talents to his fascinating tales of ghosts and wonder. The band is amazing. Theo Travis' horns are so beautifully interwoven throughout these songs as are the violin and mellotron.  \\"The Raven\\" harkens back to those classic 60's/early 70's albums like \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\", \\"Land of Grey and Pink\\" and others which stitched complex sounds and themes into tapestries of musical challenges and brilliance.  Steven Wilson has reached that plateau with this release.<br /><br />Forget all the cliche's about progressive music. \\"The Raven\\" has songs of such depth and beauty.  Right now I am fully hooked on \\"Drive Home\\" with its glorious chorus and vocals and stunning guitar solo at the end. With a great opener, \\"Luminol\\" and the dramatically poignant closer, \\"The Raven...\\", from start to finish, this is music for the ages. The sound production by Alan Parsons and Wilson alone will knock you over. The last two years of progressive music have been exceptional and \\"The Raven That Refused to Sing\\" goes right to the head of the class.
B001JQTSG6|5.0|I don't want to say is Scorsese best film, but it is one of my favorite movies. Da Niro and Pesci performances are above awesome. About the quality of the product in terms of sound and visuals, I will have to say I am not an expert, but I like to watch these types of films as if they were old.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I have a really hard time giving a book five stars when I don't like the ending, however in this case I feel the writing is definitely worth it.  As a helpless idealist, I prefer happy endings, all is well with the world, everyone good survives, all the bad guys somehow miraculously are killed, jailed, converted or cured ... Oh yeah.  But somehow all the best books are more realistic, maybe because that's what life is!  Oh well, guess when I need a good happy ending, I'll have to pick we a nice romance novel, but for now ... I loved this book ... all of it.  Even though the ending was unexpected, or wanted (LOL), I can certainly imagine a book two with a surprise beginning!  I doubt it after all these years, but you never know.  Maybe Mr Matheson has one hidden somewhere that will be a surprise release someday.  In any case, I loved reading all the places where the movies (3) got their beginnings.  Great read.
B000065V42|5.0|My 7 year old wanted to see all the Honey I Shrunk movies, and Amazon was the only place we could find them. A bonus that they were not too expensive. He has been loving watching them over and over.

B004TI5N38|4.0|Looking forward to many good reads about John Puller..  This was a very interesting plot line, maybe a little scary.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I received my product in the promised time period and love this show.  Everything is just as it should be.  I hope to own the entire series eventually!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I'm so glad I watched this the day before the Oscars.  Visually stunning with an engrossing story line. Just wonderful!  I wll be watching it again.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|The restoration looks great and the special features were a real treat to watch.  They even included the episode of Reading Rainbow with Levar Burton when he was on the set of Star Trek as a behind the scenes show from way back.  There are other fun extras in there too, I won't give them all away.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had a hard time getting into the show for the first few episodes but I am now hooked. The story is well developed and the acting superb. I also appreciate the fact that it is clean and wholesome.
B000VI12ZS|3.0|Knowing the things I learned in the military this was a very believable story. Some of the interaction between characters was a little contrived and didn't have a bearing on what was being put out there.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I am half was through it and plan on buying the second season also.  I do not have HBO so this was a great way for me to see it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was better than expected - couldn't put it down.  Thought I knew how it was going to end...but I didn't.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|What a inspiring documentary.  Greatly written, went thru so many emotions.  Love Rodriquez!!!  Even bought his music thru Amazon!!!  !!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game doesn't suck like all those other minecraft apps. It is really fun. But it isn't as good as the Xbox or PC version. And maybe in the next update you will be able to create monsters in creative. ITS AN AWESOME  GAME YOU SHOULD BUY IT ITS WORTH. THE MONEY
1250027624|5.0|Downton Abbey is Marvelous!!!<br /><br />This was absolutely wonderful as this series is my favorite program . I cannot wait for the fourth series to be out in DVD.
B007CFL4WO|4.0|This book had a lot of promise in the beginning, but I found the ending to be quite lacking from what I expected. I found the book to be very intersting in the beginning with his illness pulling me in and the relationship between Hanna and Michael leaving me wanting more, but I found the book boring around the end of part 2 and onward. The book also makes me wonder if the author made it intentional to leave so many questions unanswered and why she didn't reveal more about Hanna. When I read the summary on the outside of this book, I thought there would be an epic secret revealed about Hanna, but I found myself dissapointed. I liked the difference in maturity Michael seems to have in part 2 and the aspect of this relationship between Hanna and Michael becuase it is myserious and makes me want to discover the answers to what Hanna may have been hiding. I was really disappointed to find out that Hanna was, in fact, no be secretive because she was a spy, but because she had a lot pride and could not handle people knowing her weakness of not being able to read. I thought that the trial would get all dramatic, with Michael standing up for Hanna or being kicked out of the room for speaking out of turn, but no such thing happened. I think I had too high expectations of this book, but the ending does not make me want to turn away from watching the movie for this book. The book made me anticipate watching the movie even more, so I could compare and contrast.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is an incredibly handy app. Like having a full-sized desk calculator always available. Large enough (on my large sized Fire) where if you have need for others to see your calculations, such as in sales, It would work fine.<br /><br />If I had a wish list, I would wish for being able to label each line item ie, tax, delivery, closing costs, etc. and a read out that would simulate a tape in a physical calculator so that I could re-check a column of entrys. As a desktop full size calculator it is excellent.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|One of the best biographical books I have read in a long time.  A must read and a recommendation to anyone who wants to read about an American hero.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wow, this is a lot more than I thought it would be. This book is a great way to show your kid that just because someone is different, it doesn't mean that they don't have feelings.

0307352153|4.0|Quiet details a fascinating history of the rise of psychology and what I would call the idolatry of personality. It is so easy to become immersed in the nitty-gritty of why people are the way they are, but caution must be exercised or one personality \\"type\\" will soon be elevated as superior. This, in fact, is exactly what the author says has happened ~ the rise of the Extrovert Ideal.<br /><br />Yet, introverts have a lot to offer such as attention to detail, thorough analysis, and a steady manner in communication. The American ideal of extroversion has convinced our culture to overlook the contributions of introverts, though, much to our detriment. Much of our modern way of life is the result of the deep thinking and innovation of introverts.<br /><br />The writing is superb, and the author includes many personal anecdotes as well as incidents of famous introverts in a story-telling manner, relieving the book from having a research-paper feel. I was disappointed that it wasn't more Christian. I requested it from a Christian publisher, but I'm not familiar with who owns whom in the publishing world, and the name on the spine didn't match the website. There were many mentions of evolution, secularism, and politics. However, if you can bypass that, Quiet is well worth the read. You will come away from it understanding and accepting your own introversion better or the introversion of a spouse or child. You won't want to miss the last fifty pages or so about living as or with an introvert.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Have enjoyed all the episodes<br />The costumes are amazing<br />The story has a way of drawing you in and wanting to see more

B005PK56TA|5.0|Can't wait for season 2 to be released on Amazon Prime. Fun fun fun scary scary scary exciting exciting exciting
B000HL09MG|2.0|Conversations were painfully dragged out. Nicole Kidman's character talked too slow; it was annoying. The resolution was cheesy. The only thing it had going for it was a little shock value.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I read the story after I heard the movie was coming out. It was predictable until the end which was a nice twist.  Very similar to Sleeping With the Enemy.  Extra star if you are a Nicholas Starks  fan.
B004NOH9LC|1.0|This movie was far from funny or entertaining. I respect Harrison Ford and Rachel McAdams, but they couldn't save this movie.
B008602KQI|5.0|I already watched it about five times<br /><br />THE HUNGER GAMES IS AMAZINGLY AWESOMELY EPICZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Ideas the book twice.<br /><br />SOOOO AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! :D
B00AVF8USS|5.0|This is my first HD movie with my HD TV. I have seen it before but the HD makes the characters look real! Sound was amazing too. The movie has humor, drama and great characters.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is an entertaining film with some amazing scenes.  Since I mostly watch Bollywood, I wasn't really interested in the main cast as much as for Dev Patel who did an amazing job as the idealistic hotel manager Sunil.  Patel lends grace, warmth, and charm to his character and commands every scene he is in.  The other highlight was Judi Dench, whose acting and narration made the movie stronger than it would have been otherwise.  An unexpected plus was the music on the main menu of the DVD, a very soothing treat for the ears.  This is a rare film which offers an accurate glimpse into life not just in Jaipur but on a larger scale, India.  (I have been watching it over and over again since receiving it last week, it's that good.)
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Just didn't find it interesting enough to finish.  Not what I typically read and I see why. Not that's it's a bad book, just not my cup of tea.
0062238868|5.0|Great read. Enjoying my husband reading this book to me and the kids in honor of this American hero.<br />All the proceeds from his book go to the families of the soldiers he served with that didn't make it back.
0307352153|3.0|I got this book because I am the extrovert trying to understand the introverts that live under my roof. The book itself was good. I did love the history behind it. I liked Susan Cain's examples of introverts that we owe a great deal to. The physiological reasoning for introverts really had me stopping and looking at the ones around me. But when she started comparing cultures i was slightly taken aback. I just think there was a leap there that didn't land well. Overall an ok book.<br /><br />I received this book from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing Group in exchange for my honest opinon
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is super cool it teaches you to be responsible. it is awesome. I hope you enjoy it as I have.

0547848412|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. While tragic, it is also hysterically funny and well-written.
0307474259|5.0|Taubes does a great job of breaking down how to eat.  This book will save your life and keep you away from the doctor and that is a good thing...
0061122416|5.0|This is an excellent book and a good product. It was in the condition that I ordered. I am very satisfied with this product.
B001BR7CZW|4.0|This is vintage Saturday Night Live. Corny but funny and I love the music. There are cameo roles by many famous singers and actors like Ray Charles and Carrie Fisher.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is better than SimCity. I love the hints and the graphics in my kindle fire hd. Just wish expansions and hill dozing didn't cost so many investment points
630560973X|4.0|Okay, someone let the environmental wackoes into the script writing room, but I think it is the second best of the movies. The wrath of Kahn being the better one. I like the use of humor and find this to be a mix between sci-fi and comedy. If you are a trekkie or just like this sort of stuff, you have got to watch this one.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is awesome. The only downside is that it takes a long time to upgrade gear unless you want to shell out some money, but is not a bad game to play for a few minutes a day.
B0032JTV74|3.0|Glee is an amazing series for all people who love musical and pop music. The story is OK and the songs complete the storyline. If you like the glee series you should also check out this acapella movie [...]

B003AKLFAG|5.0|With excellent cinematography, haunting musical choices, and great acting, OldBoy is a solid film that stands out against the mediocrity that plagues many low budget korean dramas.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good hidden object gameplay. Nice puzzles! Graphics are great too! So far, one of my from this developer. I can't wait for sequel.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|it worked well. I would recommend to anyone who just enjoys looking at the stars themselves, very educational, my kids love it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|real tv, the way it should be, quality, great, cannot wait until the next season, we watch it over and over
B008RXYOKY|5.0|I use this primarily to convert my iMac Thunderbolt to a 4-pin Firewire cable that goes into my DV video camera. No issues whatsoever, does exactly what I expect it to.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app for school. I use it all the time in school or for homework it a great app for anything
B008M7JODC|4.0|If you enjoy good sci-fi you'll like this.  A bit bloody in the first season, but still very well done.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is absolutely AMAZING! I'ts like a pocket size version. You can just click on it and do your thing. It's great!
B004W2V254|5.0|Great adventure movie about really life experiences a must watch if you are an outdoor person.  Easy to follow even with the English subtitles.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|This series is the best damn show wvwe made. Season two is an excellent follow up  to the first season, as well as providing hints of things to come. Love it.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|A book that makes you think of the choices that you make in life - It touched and moved me.  It inspired me to research organisation such as Dignitas and made me wonder what I would do given the same circumstance.  Loved every minute of reading this book.
B005URRCUY|5.0|it's The Black Keys. Need I say more. I already own all of their albums. I bought this so I could give as a gift , and spread the genius of The Black Keys

B005H0IW6W|5.0|I really like Michael Buble's voice and this is a nice CD.  The family seemed to like it, too when we played it over Christmas.
B0015NORBE|5.0|I've owned this cd for decades and it's one of my favorites. Other reviewers have discussed and critiqued the album, and I have nothing to add in regards to its merits as a work of art.  I recently purchased this on vinyl (200 gram reissue)  and am glad I did.  Some re issues sound no better than their cd versions, or worse than the original vinyl issued when the album was released.  I can not comment as to how this compares sonically to the original pressing, but can compare to the cd version.  Firstly, there are flaws to the original masters which are quite evident in the vinyl.  The hiss of the old analog equipment, and a couple pops are somewhat pronounced.  I don't have a problem with this as the vinyl is true to what is there in the masters.  I think of it as a historically accurate representation of the source.  On a more positive note Lou Reed sounds like he is in the room.  There is a realism to his voice, and the timbre of the instruments in the vinyl that the cd lacks.  I'll make a digital copy of the record to listen to in the car and ditch the store bought version of the cd I bought.  There is nothing wrong with the cd at all. It's as good as one could reasonably expect from a cd.  The benefits of analog are no match for a mass produced digital version though.  Definitely worth repurchasing on vinyl: warts and all.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is a nice video for just about any age.  Our two year old granddaughter LOVES this and we adults like it too.  It came as expected and in the right amount of time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|be ready to charge your (whatever) all day cuz that's how long you'll be playing it. this game is so addictive, you'll play it day and night(even if your parents tell you to stop.)just buy it already.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This is good continuation of Dr Who that starts down the doctors darker side, but still has classic Dr Who sci-fi fun.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I uploaded this quickly for my sick child who not able to at home in her bed while she was sick
B004DLPXAO|1.0|This will not load onto my device. My device is listed on my amazon profile, (a Pandigital Planet 7) I downloaded the app store, downloaded the app, then it would pause while loading, and never start again. None of the apps that I tried from the Amazon app store would load onto my device. If they are incompatible, Amazon should not have let me download it onto my device in the first place. I did not pay anything, but I wasted a couple of days messing with it.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Rick Riordan is a Splendid author. His books include adventure and wonderful characters.<br /><br />If you have read Percy Jackson before, these books (Heroes of Olympus) take place after those events. (Read The Lost Hero before this one!) The Goddess Juno has told the Romans that something big is about to happen. It's up to Percy,Hazel, and Frank to stop the Awakening of Gaea.<br /><br />I loved this book due to the fact it is full of adventure and has characters you will begin to feel for.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|for all ages! enjoyed it very much, nearly watched it twice! Lovely plot and scenery. Those three little brothers are especially fun to watch

0316224588|5.0|What is there to ay that others have not herein?  This was my first Rankin  . . .and halfway through I ordered the first 3. And then contacted my travel agent about a trip to Scotland (and London, to be sure). My agent asked if I knew what it was like to drive around northern Scotland; I said I've been informed, but it does sounds like a hoot-and-a=half, especially with a whiskey stop every 20 klicks. And,aside from being a nice serial MisPers plot with cranky people and curmudgeonly dialogue galore, &#34;Grave&#34; is my kind of travelogue . . .Hey, I'm working on a board game on Macbeth so I can write it all off anyway. (What, a phone call from Malcolm Fox?  Hmmmmm . . .)  rhb
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Great action and awesome cast.  And finally a Mission Impossible movie plot I actually understand! Great sequence in climbing the tower.
1451695195|1.0|I thought that this book would have some merit because of the author's background. But there's nothing new here (unless you count the mud and worms blocking his moving towards \\"the light\\".) And if this experience just HAD to be shared, it could have been done in a single page article. I felt it was just another attempt to sell a book.
B00280LYIC|5.0|A very suspenseful and entertaining book!  Filled with gods and monsters, satyrs and super heroes, adventures that any young adult and even us older adults would enjoy!  I look forward to more stories of Percy Jackson!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is an awesome bag for the price.<br />Backpack has plenty of zipper pockets as well.<br />Very roomy and spacious.  Comfortable design.<br />Very happy.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|As a basis of comparison please note that I have been a PC gamer since the days of Wolfenstein 3D, and I remember when we gamers made the transition from keyboard based motivation to mouse/keyboard control.<br /><br />Moving from Razer products to Anker is much the same ... it's different - but so much about it is better and just feels right.<br /><br />8000 dpi is a preposterous amount of sensitivity ... and I am hell-bent on mastering it as I primarily play twitch based FPS where a steady hand is greatly accentuated by a high sensitivity<br /><br />The programmable macros just set me to rights in Starcraft II as well as keeping up my APM high (I just hit 150 before posting this ... nearly 10 APM more than with my Razer Mamba)<br /><br />If you know what the weight of a Razer Mamba is - this is roughly 1/4 with all additional weight added. That being said I never knew how much the inherent weight of the mouse was lagging up my play.<br /><br />All in all a great mouse. Anker really set the bar up high for others to follow.<br /><br />(UPDATE)<br /><br />Lifespan of mouse was Feb 29th to Oct 23rd. Now the mouse randomly right clicks wherever the pointer is. I would have expected this from the left click since I tend to play A LOT of computer games, but the right click is only ever used 1/2 to 3/4 as often and died pretty quick considering the amount of use it got. Tried re-installing software but it didn't help. It was good while it lasted, but a mouse that can't stand up to even a year of heavy use is pretty flimsy.
B0069UP2PI|3.0|I read somewhere that in the USSR there used to be a saying about hospitals, &#34;floors parquet, docs ok.&#34;  Well this movie reminds me of that but in reverse, I suppose.  It's got some pretty high profile actors in it and they all did really well (not excellent) but the plot line is SO overused and Contagion did nothing, absolutely nothing, to put itself above all of the other movies like it.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Totally addicting, my husband and I watched the whole season in a week. Action packed and full of drama from start to finish.
B005DN7W4G|3.0|How many times can the &#34;giant meteor about to kill Earth&#34; dead horse be beaten?  This an incredibly over-used plot line and Deep Impact did absolutely nothing unique.  What's that? A giant asteroid? Ok, send up some astronauts with a bunch of nukes to blow it out of the sky.  There wasn't any particularly great performance by any of the cast.  Morgan Freeman pulled off his role in typical Freeman-esque fashion but I can't really pick out any other standout performances.  Overall a very mediocre movie
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|A very good movie, but they messed it up for me using my God's name in vain!  Would not recommend.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great mind exercise and lots of fun!<br />i am addicted to this game and would recommend it to everyone!<br />good luck and enjoy
1616550414|5.0|Please read this, Zelda fans, granted, it has a lot of Skyward Sword, but it's obviously easiest to find content on Skyward Sword because it was the most recent game. A great great read, full of beautiful artwork and lore, stop reading this crappy review and buy this book, seriously.
B0076HNCTQ|5.0|A liitle dark, a little kooky. The show draws you in though. Plan to watch all episodes for the first season.
B000FGGE7C|5.0|I got this as a present for my husband.  We looked everywhere for this and could not find it.  I was very happy to find it here and satisfied with the price I got it for.
B004SBULWE|3.0|Does not kill the apps often enough as I noted it would have, like it did on my old Android phones.
1400069807|4.0|To begin with my by-now rote preamble, I received this book from a GoodReads drawing. Despite that kind and generous and typical consideration I give my candid opinions below.<br /><br />The premise of this book can be summed up very simply. Food companies are creating products that while not intended to kills us, nevertheless are doing so. By using science and marketing (in some cases derived from research done by that purest of evils, cigarette companies) big foods can manipulate us into eating more and more of their products until we drop dead. While we think the government is trying to protect us from such evils, in fact most of the time the feds are helping and subsidizing the efforts of food companies to shove more and unhealthier food down our throats to line their pockets. I'd say that about covers it.<br /><br />Michael Moss's definitive tome on food marketing is exhaustive, at times daunting and the best book on this topic I've read since \\"Fast Food Nation\\" so many years ago. Moss has covered the basics with a wealth of detail and reasoning that should be abundantly terrifying to those who find themselves putting frozen pizzas and Hot Pockets into their cart at the grocery store. He paints a picture that is stark and, sadly, a bit hopeless. While our author does spend a tiny bit of time on the efforts of food companies to stop killing us softly with salt, sugar and fat, he doesn't really seem to hold out much hope. He closes with a chunk on liquid foods designed for people after they have bariatric surgery. The image of people tube-feeding themselves from a plastic container is pretty haunting but that seems to be what we're coming to.<br /><br />This book is wonderfully researched, eruditely and well written and I hope against hope that it's somehow unbalanced. Moss's picture is grim indeed but his arguments are so well constructed that one doesn't really have the heart to argue with them. As a book it can sometimes be a bit daunting and is best taken, I think, in 1-hour chunks. On one level this lets the argument settle in over the course of several days and make you subconsciously examine what YOU'RE eating. The book is very helpful and specific in the foods and products it chooses to excoriate. A conscientious reader will find themselves at least slightly changed for the better. On another level, taking the book in small pieces dampens a bit the somewhat repetitive cadence of the whole thing. Here's a type of food. Here's why it's bad. Here's the history of it. Here's who I talked to about it and what they had to say. Lather, rinse, repeat. Taken in long sittings this is probably much less effective. I stretched this one out over a week and felt myself well served and well-educated.<br /><br />In summary, this is the sort of book that leaves you changed at a fundamental level. Like books before it, you never quite see the world the same way again. On the whole, I feel pretty good about my diet even before, relative to how Moss describes the typical American diet but there's always room for improvement and this book is one that gives a not so gentle nudge in the right direction. It's also the sort of book you want to pass around to everyone you know; it should be subtitled, \\"Read this before the next time you open your mouth.\\"think, in 1-hour chunks.

B004Q7CIFI|3.0|Mr. King is a great writer.  The theme and plot were very interesting.  I did not appreciate the language, however, nor the obvious bias and stereotyping  the character (author?) does.  Even though I am educated and have taught English for many years, the character (author?) would have viewed me as crazy.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Safe haven. Best book  that I have read and enjoyed for a long time  truly a masterpiece  real life situations a must read
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it. It's better than the first one I'm very  addicted to this game I play all day. It's a lot of fun
B006RXQBR0|5.0|I love Dennis Lehane's novels featuring Patrick and Angie, and Gone Baby Gone is one of his best. The movie really captures the emotional intensity of the book. It also gives a vivid sense of place -- the blue-collar Boston neighborhood where Patrick and Angie grew up and where they still live and work.<br /><br />Casey Affleck is simply amazing as Patrick, and there is an unforgettable scene where he  explains to an angry and heartbroken Angie why he made a certain choice.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I thought it was well written and enjoyable to read. The story is very detailed, however it did not prove the exsistance of God or &#34;Heaven&#34;. I was disappointed that he did not &#34;prove&#34; heaven exsists. He just gave a similar story as others have to what happens when you are close to death. As long as someone is still alive there is reasonable doubt as to what actually happens when you die.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Really enjoyed this series. Makes one wonder how the world would be different if a &#34;small&#34; change had been made.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I'm really glad I didn't see this in the theater. It's definitely a rental. My 6 year old enjoyed it as well as the adults.
B00BHMF578|1.0|Sound did not work on Roku device.  Had to watch the movie in non-HD through computer on Amazon Website. Second time sound not coming in on Amazon on Roku.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is one of the best hidden object and puzzle mystery games I have  played.  There are a lot of hidden object courses and the<br />  mini games are quite challenging but not hard enough to get you too frustrated. Looking forward to more like this.
B005QPMB2Y|2.0|I was previously using the free version, but it didn't have an audio feature.  As I planned to use it as a baby monitor, I decided to pay the $3.99 and upgrade it to the full version which stated it supported audio.  Unfortunately, it was a waste of money as it's not compatible with the webcam I'm using; the video is fine (as it was with the free version), but I still do not have audio.
B004TTHLBE|2.0|Neil Gaiman says this book recieved hot and cold reviews. Count me as cold. Maybe it was too playful. The short story wedged in there about the serial killer was mildly interesting but the rest was too cartoony for me. Guess my expectations were for something different.
B003VIWO8Y|4.0|I call Dave Mustaine the &#34;Pete Best of Metallica.&#34;  Just like The Beatles'  Pete Best, Dave Mustaine was unceremoniously kicked out of Metallica on the eve of recording their first album.  And he has been in mourning about that ever since.  At times that becomes a burden to keep reading about.  I knew Dave Mustaine had a drinking problem (the primary reason for his Metallica expulsion), but was unaware that he went on to have an even worse drug problem.  His relapses and multiple rehabs were a constant throughout the book.  I have read almost every biography of Metallica, but was curious about this original Metallica member to learn the full spectrum of his life- not just his short (but legendary) tenure in Metallica.  He went on to lead a very successful thrash metal band Megadeth, but never felt satisfied being &#34;number 2&#34; to Metallica.  While Metallica has longevity with its core band members, Dave's Megadeth seemed to have a revolving door of bandmates.  His only mainstay was bassist Dave &#34;Junior&#34; Ellefson.  While this book was well-written, it was the melancholy it left me with that made it hard to finish.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If you read books like Bill Streever's &#34;Cold&#34; or his &#34;Heat&#34; but want a narrative that moves science along in a personable way like the movie &#34;Alien&#34; then this book is for you. (Yes, you can read slow build-up to tension in that statement.) The narrative voice is humourous and dry and amazingly stable in some disastrous situations. The plot is believable and, as you read along, you can't help wondering if Andy Weir (the writer) works for NASA or JPL or something like that. It is a good piece of work that suffers only from the lack of a good copy editor, but it was never a stumbling block for me. If this book is finally picked up by a publisher with a smart editor, it could become as much of a classic as one of Michael Crichton's works.<br />It has all the right stuff.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I enjoyed this book up to the point in the book where it became silly. By this, I mean where the author took an interesting story that flowed well, and then injected a crisis that completely jarred with the story.<br /><br />I felt disappointed with how the story was turned and thrown against the wall as a way to end it.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This is a good series but a little soap opera.  I do like the historical aspect which deals with the people and their way of life.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The product came in 3 days, as promised. The packaging was simple. The case itself seems sturdy, and installation was quick and easy.The whole shell seems very professional and well-made, and Marware has a 1 yr warranty. There are cut-out areas where the speakers and power cord opening are located, so there is never an access issue. After only 2 days of owning it, I have no complaints so far. I watched the video on Marware about it, and it is exactly as advertised. I recommend it!
B004LP3AYI|4.0|At the time I made this &#34;purchase,&#34; the Kindle version was free.  I own it in paperback already, but I have a tendency to re-read books several times, so I picked it up.  BECAUSE FREE.  Why wouldn't I?<br /><br />These books are decent.  They start out pretty excellent and sort of decline from there.. but by the time you realize they're becoming less and less entertaining, you're already too invested to stop.  At least, I was.  So I finished them.  All of them all the way up through Phantom and Confessor.  (I can't remember which order those two were written in. It's been a year or two since I read any of them.)<br /><br />If you ask me, Goodkind gets a little preachy around the fourth or fifth book and the series sort of becomes a platform for the advocacy of communism, rather than an entertaining fantasy series.  I was able to read through it, for the sake of his lesser-liked characters, and finish the series.  I felt like I owed them that, at least.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much it's really really awesome kids all over the world should play this game :)

B00APJLFEG|3.0|Adam Sandler is becoming less and less funny. This story is just so predictable and uninteresting, and there is not one interesting performance in the cast. Some of the animation is pretty cool, but that's where it ends. Not worth renting.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I agree that it is addictive but I disagree that it is mindless entertainment. It is a good brain exercise.
0451532082|4.0|Read this fine American classic, then read Geraldine Brooks' March for a fleshed out story of the absent father in Little Women.
B00821OX98|5.0|I watched it straight through on a long weekend. It was really well done. I never thought the Dr from the ER would be good in a SCI-FI show.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Well written;unique style . Best book I have read in a long time.I recommend it to all. Sad subject well executed
B006MW3UZW|5.0|streaming was excellent-<br />color and sound good<br />do not watch other similar tv but this is great<br />all round jolly good entertainment
0307887448|5.0|A lot has been made of the fact that this book steeps itself in 80's pop-culture nostalgia.  While that is true, and folks who were around long enough to remember that stuff will get an extra level of enjoyment out of it, I think the story stands on its own.  The 80's references are explained well enough so that the story is plenty understandable, even if the reader was not previously familiar with them.  And the vision of the future that the story presents is an fascinating and somewhat plausible one, in my opinion.  I think anyone who enjoys science fiction will enjoy this book, whether they remember the 80's or not.
034580404X|1.0|my mistake for taking a recommendation with out researching<br />cute little story line just found the s&m untitilating<br />however  great success mass consumption obvious need for more imagination in the humdrum of daily lives
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Deceptively simple: 'Winning' is fairly easy (at least on the early levels), it's when you go back to master each track that the game's depth (and replayability) becomes apparent. Don't let the cutsie name and somewhat lacking screenshots cause you to miss out on a truly fun little game - after all, it's free!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you like the series, you will love it! Stayed up way too late finishing off this season, beware.  Great series.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Just beautiful ,I don't like all the Ken's books but when he's writing sagas he's the best.<br />Thanks ken Follett
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Listening to music can be soothing, but listening to Josh Groban is inspiring as well. This young man has the talent to make music beyond any I have heard in a long time. He reminds me in his own way of how Elvis was able to use backup musicians to accompany him and give us more than a simple melody. Josh Groban is the epitome of a professional musician. He shows no ego in his presentation and just produces a wonderful, loving and full sound every time he sings. I love this CD and will buy anything he gives us!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|My son's Nabi tablet doubles as my on the go pc, but without Adobe I couldn't view pdf's. Now I can.
B0017T4IG0|5.0|This was a very entertaining movie with a great soundtrack, amusing script and likable actors.<br />It would be such a refreshing change from the crass comedies full of toilet humor that seem to be<br />all that is produced now.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|If you're a &#34;Downton&#34; fan, this dvd is a must.  I couldn't wait to order it and it didn't disappoint me.  Arrived promptly and in great condition.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great series. Complex enough to watch about once a year. Which is fortunate since it costs so much for so few episodes.
B009CPGHDI|5.0|I loved this movie. Very interesting to see all her ups and downs, and how much work goes into a tour.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Crashes on 1st Gen Kindle fire and doesn't save work!  Would not spend extra $for the font pack that reminds you to buy it every start up because it makes no sense to when the original product is toliet bowl material. Negative 5 stars.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Despite of its 2 size C batteries, it holds my Feit Electric flashlight snugly and a short break-in period will make it a perfect fit...the rotating belt clip functions well...good buy!!!
B002HML6Y8|5.0|any vampire lover would love this move i really love this movie. it was filled with all kinds of action and kids and adults who like hugh jackman should watch this
B0038M2AZA|5.0|For something inspirational this is the movie.  I've shared it with several people, who, after watching this DVD, went out and bought one for themselves.  The acting is great as well.  It is a wonderful, funny, inspirational movie.  Kudos.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW! What a read. Loved it, loved it, loved it. My emotions where everywhere from highs to lows and never for one second did I want this to end! Brilliant.
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|Awesome all the way around.. It's been a long time since I seen a movie that Rocked all the way through..
B000VHVGM8|5.0|Very entertaining from start to finish.  Great sights and lots of action too.  Loved all of the actors and actresses.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Entertaining, but definitely got Best Picture worthy. Ben Affleck is lucky it was a good story to begin with.<br /><br />I don't even want to know what the mustache budget was on this flick.
B0094K1QR8|5.0|good movie, everyone likes the two stars.  Somewhat depth to it with enough comedy to keep anyone interested.  would recommend
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Enjoyed the movie and special effects.  The sound track at the beginning was awesome with Adele singing.  Took me by surprise at how it ended.
0679805273|5.0|My son is graduating from High School this spring and thought this book would be a clever way for party guests to sign and write a message.<br /><br />Book was brand new and shipping was super fast.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It would better if we didn't have to pay real money to get special moves ... But I like the destruction.
B00821OX98|4.0|This is a great series , I would reccomend it to all my family and friends . I can not wait for the next release .
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This app is kinda annoying like when I finish a game there's always these ads that you can't exit out of an then I have to go to my home page and go on it again. And of course when your guessing something there's no skip button so you have to watch the whole thing even if it's an hour long. And I'm not saying there completely responsible for this but when the other player won't respond they do nothin about it.
B00BHMEALA|1.0|Don't waste your time. Another B-movie. Affleck's performance was as unconvincing as ever.<br /><br />Generations ago actors were esteemed less than your average peasant. Today however, they are glorified and exalted as demigods to our youth from even the steps of The White House by &#34;star-struck&#34; media and politicians who have forgotten the true character of heroes, public service, and Virtue.<br /><br />Actors like Affleck profit promoting violence and sex to the minds of our nation's youth, but then uses his little pulpit to condemn others in society.
B00011D1OA|5.0|I love the songs and the premise of the movie.  Excellent remake of Pygmalion story, including superior actors and environment.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I grew up watching this movie! The songs and story have never gotten old to me. I appreciate that it's a Disney movie without the traditional princess.
B000002OVJ|5.0|I used to have the original vinyl. Bought it when i was like 12 at Sears in the record department (remember the record department? upstairs at the Westland Mall location?? Bought Live @Leeds & Who Are You? fast forward to about ten years ago. I finally got around to re-buying Live@Leeds on cd. I am happy with the bonus tracks on here: Heaven and Hell, Tattoo, and Fortune Teller-The strongest 'bonus' track is Enwhistle's Heaven & Hell. My faves on the original album is the smokin take on Eddie Cochran's Summertime Blues as well as a smoldering take on Johnny Kidd & The Pirates' Shakin All Over. Great versions of Magic Bus, Substitute, SeeMe Feel Me, and My Generation. Too bad Keith Moon and John Enwhistle have checked into their respective suites in RocknRoll Heaven. It must've been RnR Heaven to have been in attendance at this gig! At least we have this killer disc as a memento of good times past & gone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love to watch Downton Abbey, don't you?  Very easy to access and not syncing problems.  Can't wait to see the rest of it.
B00335EQ0E|1.0|I ordered this product as a gift for my nieces. They were so dissapointed when they tried to watch it and it didnt work. It was a huge hassle trying to get a replacement. I had to forward my sister in law the return label and then wait on her to return the dvd. Finally my nieces received the replacement dvd only to find that THAT one didnt work. Now amazon will not send a replacement because they assume we will have the same problem. So they are sending my neices a gift card. Problem is, I did not want them to have a gift card. I wanted them to have this DVD. My advice is NOT to purchase this item as i have read several other reviews that have stated that the dvd wont play. It is clearly a defective product.
B004G606K8|5.0|A great read when I was 12 and it's still a great read!  I love it all the memories it's bringing back
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great program, gets you hooked into following the characters.  Love that I could start at beginning for free having Amazon Prime. It's gotten such great accolades, but I didn't want to start in the 3rd season, not knowing how they got there.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|I ordered this for a Christmas gift, so have not heard it.  The person who did get it is a Leonard Cohen fan and has enjoyed it.
B006MW3UZW|3.0|This show would have gotten 5 stars from me if captions had been available, and the streaming videos were the main reason I signed up for Amazon Prime. It is inexplicable to me that a show like this would be broadcast on Amazon Prime without captions. There are hundreds of millions of hearing impaired people around the world, and it only takes a little diminishment of hearing ability to miss a lot of the dialog, especially with the unfamiliar British accents of the characters. Since apparently none of the videos on this service offer captions I opted not to upgrade my trial membership.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|This is a classic movie about a drug lord and his habits causing his downfall. You see the rise of a criminal dishwasher turned hired gun that moves up the underworld ranks. This movie is referenced by anybody that has had any dealings with the underworld and coke. Rick Ross remixed the soundtrack, posters are sold in flea markets, and the original movie poster is constantly being used by many artist even the Simpsons. This is the epitome of a drug lord and the fast life of a drug overlord. Champagne wishes and cocaine dreams!
B002JXICCY|3.0|Nostalgia rules here.. nice to see the movie again after many years. You just can't help but realize that Zeppelin's real magic was in the studio
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is probably the best app in the store! I could play forever if I wanted to! They have creative AND survival! I heard some people say that it's always day in survival so obviously their making an excuse because there to scared to do it. You like this app, or your wrong!

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|An interesting twist made an intriguing book excellent. Enjoyed reading this book immensely. Sky makes you think about feelings and thoughts that people may bury.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This book is a little slow at first but inactivity to about 60 percent, it gets really God's! Huge cliff hanger at the end!
B004J4WKTW|1.0|I disliked this book from the first page.  Every time I  picked it up to read, I'd fall asleep just after a few pages.  I tried to read the whole book because it was the book of the month for our book club.  Just couldn't finish it.
B008HK3XOU|3.0|Case is ok. Thought price was a little high for what it is. Don't like the strap either. More in the way than it is useful.
B004J4WNL2|3.0|This very long study of introversion offered many great tidbits of knowledge about introverts, their particular skills and abilities, and how introverted qualities have often been subordinated to extroversion, particularly in America and corporate culture. I was intrigued by a lot of the studies about workplace organization--Cain points to studies showing that workers who have their own space and are free from interruption are more productive and better at brainstorming than their counterparts in busy or open offices that promote &#34;collaboration.&#34; These arguments interest me particularly in the current climate where office managers are thinking about how best to organize workers. There were also chapters on risk taking, the stock market, politics, sensitivity, etc. Although the study sets out to &#34;recover&#34; or &#34;renew&#34; the value of introversion, the author often seems so skewed toward introverts that she seems to debase extroverts as maniacs who destroyed Wall St, cheat on their partners, and engage in risky business practices. This bias makes the study sound unprofessional in certain sections, and a more balanced approach to these different personality types would make the whole text seem more reliable. Overall, it was a fun read for my commute, but was of course not a serious academic study and therefore, I'd take its conclusions with a big grain of salt.
B0015346OM|4.0|it was confising at times with all the names and initials tthere were too many names  and grouos they beloned to.The initials in capital letters was confusing.

B004ALB8OM|3.0|Its a downer from beginning to end.  I can only hope the wrestling entertainment industry is not that sad in reality.
B00886XQO0|5.0|I bought theses a few months back and there still working like a charm I'm  not a real cod fan but theses headsets are the nicest if owned no cords no interference has great blue tooth great sound great features and the craftsman ship is very nice love the leather black with and orange stitch. Amazing! I would recommend getting insurance just because accidents and faultless do happen I buy warrants with everything!
B009CF7GRY|3.0|Best part of movie was Julianne. Way to much like the first movie. Could predict every move. Was exspeting something different to only get the same
1400049628|5.0|Great book fun to read and great to have on hand it's more of a conversation piece but I would recommend to anyone who wants a good laugh and if you like zombies lol.
B00BESIKWM|1.0|This movie was terrible, a complete injustice to the first \\"Silent Hill\\". Don't even waste your money on this one.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Not what I expected. Truly an interesting read for all. This book should be in every high school library. Good.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I saw all of season 3 on PBS this year. Of course I had to go back and catch up on the whole story. Wonderful writing and acting. Don't miss it!
1451696191|5.0|This is a movie and a book that I have shared with my teen daughters.  There are such rich layers to this complicated and well done story.
B001LM1456|5.0|The BEST!Great Action for the family.It was fun and nonstop the whole way through once it got goin. The effects were on point.
B00005QGAZ|4.0|now, im not one to claim to be a MJ fan but this album, is probably one of the greatest albums of his. \\"THRILLER\\" really is not my favorite song at all, but i love songs like \\"HUMAN NATURE\\" and \\"BILLIE JEAN\\". those two songs make the album for me.<br /><br />overall: this is a great album for anyone who like real music or dance music...
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I found this series randomly doing a sci-fi search on Amazon. I'm completely addicted! Olivia Dunham is a believable character -- attractive but not impossibly so; athletic, imperfect, and she wears sensible shoes for an FBI agent! The Bishops make me laugh; the storylines make me think. I'm about to plunge into the second season, and I can't wait!
B000784WMW|5.0|I read Jane Eyre as a starry eyed teenager who looked forward to finding love some day. Although true love has been somewhat elusive, my romantic inclinations have stayed with me as did the words of Charlotte Bronte's most famous novel, Jane Eyre.<br /><br />This elaborate and illustrious BBC adaptation is nothing short of unforgettable. Although this version is now dated, the producers undid themselves and did the book (still one of my favourites) justice. I recognized much of the novel's dialogue and the actors truly brought the characters to life. Before the handsome Timothy Dalton would take up the role of James Bond, he effortlessly and convincingly played the enigmatic Mr. Rochester in a way, which I believe, Ms. Bronte would have wanted when she imagined this profound, unhappy and wounded man. The same can be said of Zalah Clake's portrayal of Jane. I cannot begin to say how fitting she was. This was truly a role she was born to play. She was THE PERFECT choice. Her body, her face, the way she spoke. Everything! My only regret is that after this her acting career more or less halted.<br /><br />If you want to see Jane Eyre, I recommend this mini series. Nothing else will give you a proper feel for the book and what the author who penned it wanted to convey to her audience.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|this game made me restart when I got the limited edition person.  and I had 3000 coins don't get this game
0486295559|5.0|Persuasion has been on my must-read list for a long time, ever since I read Sense and Sensibility and became an Austen fan. This edition is easy to read because the print is just the right size. The novel is one of if not her shortest and this version has very thing pages making the entire book weight nothing. I read it on my trip from the USA to the Caribbean and it is a page turner. I couldn't put it down even though I was tired and it was a night flight. The cover's very cute design is icing on the cake. It now occupies a space in my permanent library collection.
B007V65R54|5.0|Baseball fans have been familiar with Nate Silver's work for many years for his groundbreaking work at Baseball Prospectus.  He has brought his inciteful analysis to other fields.
B00881VLCE|5.0|a very calm game, i can play with when i am bored after dinner or taking my break at work .
B007OWRBJK|3.0|A little dry to most readers, not for everyone. Of interest to a true Who fan. Sex drugs and rock and roll.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|a very fun and chill game that i can play after dinner or when i am taking a break from work .
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is one of the most heartfelt stories that I have ever seen.  The actors are real to life and the lesson of loyalty is outstanding.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|It is good as a protective case, but as a stand, it doesn't hold up even on a solid surface and I am disappointed.
B005PK553C|5.0|Suspensful, creepy and surprises around every corner. Can't wait to watch season 2!!! Jessica Lang did a great job in this as well!!
B009M4KTEM|4.0|A fine addition to the Garcia collection, this Volume One of the \\"Garcialive\\" series will hopefully not be the first and last. The sound is decent, and the highlights are many. \\"Sugaree\\", \\"Dear Prudence\\", \\"How Sweet It Is\\",\\"Russian Lullaby\\" and \\"Simple Twist Of Fate\\" are all beautifully executed. The inclusion of two songs with Robert Hunter singing is a nice little bonus, but it leaves me wishing that Hunter's own albums aren't easily available on cd.
B00A77II0U|5.0|It kept me hooked. There's all kinds of puzzles, seek and find adventures, and great obstacles. The story line wasn't bad and the music and graphics were pleasantly spooky.
B0041T52S6|5.0|I bought it for my son and he has watched it many times over.  Worth the money and it is a very funny movie.  My husband and my older son and his friends even enjoyed it.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|A great recount of Bob's life and I learned something's that I wasn't aware of.  It's a great history lesson on reggae music and the impact on our culture.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|The only problem I have with this is that it doesn't have the little animals (like the pigs) included in the game. My son likes it but it lacks some items that are featured in the game. It is very small. For the price I was expecting something bigger with more content.
B00271HAK8|5.0|This is a classic movie!  I am not sure if you can call yourself an American if you have not seen this movie haha.  I definitely recommend this movie!
B004G600A4|4.0|This is a gift to my nephew and niece who now reside in socal. WE saw this movie in the theatres originally and liked it so much as to buy it! Excellent! Fun for the whole family!
B0095P33IW|5.0|Good story line.  be Lots of action.  Good video quality.  Good sound quality.  The movie streamed very well.  I really enjoyed the movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved the season and enjoyed its development.<br />I enjoyed observing the energy of the characters.<br />I look forward to the 3rd season.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Didn't think I would like scifi, but really enjoyed this. Well developed characters. Peter billings seemed the only one that threw me off at the end as I didn't feel he had a spine
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was a simple easy read. Finished it in just a few days. I really fell in love with our little awkward character and wasn't expecting the ending at all!!
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|Watching it on Kindle Fire so HD does me no good. Very well made science fiction, even if the storyline appears to 'jump' around a bit. The graphics are top notch and the actors are too. Just started watching season two--proof right there that I enjoyed it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This one delivers, it's also nice on the special effects. The shape of the challenges add a nice bit of flavor too.
1250012570|5.0|(Sorry if that's too harsh, but this book is just so dang good.)<br /><br />Where do I begin? Going into this book, I was looking for something amazing, something that would pull me out of the reading slump I felt coming on. I figured this book would either be really good--like Anna and the French Kiss, even though I never find anything on that level--or just okay. Well guess what. Eleanor & Park is at the same level as Anna and the French Kiss--and that means it absotively, posilutely, must be read.<br /><br />There were only a few things I didn't like or had problems with (but they don't really matter because I've decided to overlook them because this book is so awesome). It may be because they're not used a whole lot, but there were a few too many ellipses for my taste, and some formatting confused me. There were some scenes I couldn't picture properly for some reason--wording, maybe? (But this is super minor.)--and some of the references were lost on me since I, unfortunately, did not exist in the 80s. I did, however, learn some things. Like that the makeout section in Happy Days was called Inspiration Point (hahahahahaha) and that people didn't go out--they were &#34;going together.&#34; Part of what drew me to this book in the first place was that it was set in the 80s, and I've been wanting a John Hughes-esque 80s book forever. (Or since I started listening to &#34;Rock Me Amadeus&#34; by Falco.) But like I said, these things didn't matter because I just LOVED this book so much. (And because it's an ARC and it's not all final.)<br /><br />One of the things I really liked about this book was the characters. It's told from the alternating POVs of Eleanor and Park, who, as the synopsis says, fall in love. However, they're not your average two teens in love, and this isn't your average boy-meets-girl-they-fall-in-love story--which I didn't expect. I thought this was going to be all happy and cutesy but it was so much more than that (and it was all good). Eleanoris the new girl in school who grabs Park's attention, as well as the attention of others, and she's different. She has big, curly red hair (they call her Big Red, among other not-so-nice things) and doesn't have the body of a model or the average girl, hence the cruelty of several students. And she dresses kind of like a boy. To make matters more complicated, her life at home isn't very good. (Re: Stepdad from Hell.) Then there's Park, a Korean, comic- and music-loving guy who also kicks butt in tae-kwon-do. While his life is far from perfect, he still has it better than Eleanor. Not they're suicidal or anything, but together they give each other reasons to exist, to live. The minor characters were great--I loved Park's parents, especially his mother, and Eleanor's friends from gym class were hilarious. Some characters were douches, some were kind, but they all played their roles well and had a purpose, which I really liked.<br /><br />(Minor spoilers ahead. As in, I'm sort of telling you what happens and when, but you know it's going to happen.) I think there's something extremely successful when a writer can put off a kiss for forever but not make you mad or upset about it and still give you feels. That totally happened in this book. Park would just touch Eleanor's wrist and rub his thumb on it and HELLO BUTTERLFIES IN MY STOMACH. Seriously. It took quite some time for those two to finally kiss, and when they did, it wasn't some multiple page, majorly detailed kiss. And it worked. Completely. I constantly was all &#34;Kiss! Kiss now!&#34; and of course they didn't. But it didn't feel like it was done that way to drag the reader on--it was intentional, and it felt right. As broken as aspects of their lives and relationship may be, what Eleanor and Park have is just so stinking sweet. I love these two so much, and I just want more of them. I love some of things they said to each other, the way they acted--so darn cute, those two. In fact, I think I got teary eyed onseveral occasions because I loved this book so much, because it was so good. (There's evidence of a tear in my copy.)<br /><br />Something that can make or break a book is the writing. Fortunately, Rainbow Rowell's helped make it. While it wasn't perfect (nothing is), I don't remember having many problems, or any major, head-banging, I-can't-take-this issues. Eleanor & Park (I love how their names aren't basic) was well-written, full of great and witty dialogue, with pages that flowed really well. Not only was the writing done well, but it was done right for the story that was told.<br /><br />I wasn't very far into Eleanor & Park before I decided I was in love with it--it's that good. At one point I thought I was reading it too slowly, and that it was taking forever to finish. Then I realized I was probably unconsciously savoring every single page, every single word. This book isn't all flowerly meadows and fluffy bunny rabbits--it's also got some forest fires and wolves to taint those happy images. But it's still fantastic--it's set in the 80s, for crying out loud! I'm pretty sure this review doesn't adequately portray my thoughts on this book, and I'm probably forgetting something. But I do know the following. If Eleanor & Park doesn't make my Top Ten Best Books of 2013 list (ten books better than this? Is that possible?) I'll be shocked. This book is definitely on my list of favorite contemporaries (alongside Stephanie Perkins and Sarah Dessen, to name a few), and I'll keep my eye on Rainbow Rowell, especially for a sequel. Look out, Anna and Etienne--Eleanor and Park are coming through.
B00BESM14U|5.0|As a parent of teem and adult children, I was surprised by the 'lack' of parents in this movie, but maybe that was the point.  Intelligently done and thoughtful.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This author knows how to keep you reading his books.  They are crafted carefully to the last word.  Mr. Connelly's character, Harry Bosch, is a man of substance.  He is everyman with thoughts and cares, and a depth of soul and human-ness which cannot be found in every murder mystery one reads.  The Black Box is awesome in it scope, and the caring of the dectives in it.  Has shocking parts, but it is a WOW, and will Wow you. I found it difficult to  bookmark, but have to so I can sleep.  Just read it.  You will not regret doing that at all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was hard to put this book down. I can't wait to read the next one. I plan to start asap!

B003JTHXOK|4.0|You never can go wrong with a Nicholas Sparks novel.  It was pretty predictable until you get to the ending and that made it all good reading.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I began watching this after all my friends.  It is beautifully written and very addictive.  Now my husband and I watch it together.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Easy to learn, easy to play, and addictive. So worth the price of a free download. Several characters, and boards to unlock. This will keep you entertained for hours.
B00BLGZN1S|2.0|If you are a ten year old kid you might find this movie believable, on the other hand if you have been in the military or are a world war two history nut you will find this movie full of BS.IE us army soldiers using a Nazi sniper rifle as if it was issued to him. bombers flying so low on bomb runs they would get hit by blasts from their own bombs. Russian tanks painted up as Nazi tanks. American soldiers that don't speak any German dressing as Germans and traveling on German rail system etc. this could have been a great movie if the director wasn't your typical Hollywood girlie man. it is also as slow as molasses in winter.
B00AG6Z92C|3.0|I bought 2 CDs ..I personally have liked others by andrea Bocelli..However the CD that I gave as a gift was greatly enjoyed..charlene
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I absolutely love being able to watch the episodes without interruption and when it is convenient.  This truly is a remarkable series and it is worth every penny to have it at my fingertips when I want to relax and enjoy the story.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I was not too keen on the original stargate series, but Atlantis has been a real gem.  I enjoy the characters and the setting.
B00A8KJN14|3.0|I just now finished watching it and I was very surprised that overall I found it boring.  The movie caught my attention because I saw that the soundtrack had been released on vinyl so I thought it must be cool then so I rented it.  I think what bugs me about it is that it starts off all Disney/family friendly (boring) then in the middle it becomes very un-Disney/un-family friendly.  It just doesn't work and doesn't interest me.  I give 3 stars for the good soundtrack and Tim Burton animation.  P.S. - I won't be reading the comments.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this based on hearing it was good and once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.
B000RT5XVA|3.0|I loved reading about this era in time. However, the ending was EXTREMELY disappointing. If you want to read this classic, I suggest skipping the last chapter and creating your own ending.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I suggest getting this game it's endless fun ! I've been playing for hours way better then 3D roller coaster ! Great job.
B00340I4KG|5.0|Lots of action, memorable dialogue, its funny at times and has Nicolas Cage. John woo did a great job directing this as well. A bit slow after opening scene but quickly picks up and doesn't slow down once it gets good.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A good novel with scientific thoughts but no mention of the Bible or of a personal experiences. The Bible is very clear that a person must accept Jesus Christ as his or her personal saviour before they can go to heaven
B004R112GO|1.0|Like watching paint dry. Super low budget, boring. Off camera noise and moving furniture is not scary. Costs only 5 million to make, and I swear that seems high.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Not all Grisham novels are fun reads. And some are slow reads. This is a fast paced, don't put me down, twisty, fun read that kept me going from beginning to end with never ending surprises along the way. Who's good? Who's bad? Take your pick - but don't bet on it.
B008RLTUUA|4.0|Bad Pharma: How Drug Companies Mislead Doctors and Harm Patients by Ben Goldacre<br /><br />\\"Bad Pharma\\" is the eye-opening expose of the pharmaceutical industry.  British physician, academic and science writer, Ben Goldacre follows up his international bestselling book \\"Bad Science\\" with yet another enraging investigative book of medical journalism.  This insightful book takes you inside a secretive industry that relies on problematic practices for financial gain.<br />This blood raising 448-page book is composed of the following six chapters: 1. Missing Data, 2. Where Do New Drugs Come From?, 3. Bad Regulators, 4. Bad Trials, 5. Bigger, Simpler Trials, and 6. Marketing.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. Accessible, well-researched book that takes you inside the pharmaceutical industry.<br />2. Doctor Goldacre has great command over a fascinating topic.<br />3. Excellent format.  The author lays out his critical arguments of the pharmaceutical industry by sections and provides pragmatic solutions.  He is consistent throughout the book.<br />4. Does a great job of explaining key medical terms, and provides a glossary of terms for quick reference.<br />5. Exposes the conflict of interests within the industry...starting with industry-funded trials.  Negative results that go missing in action and the danger of exposing people to unnecessary risks. \\"Because researchers are free to bury any result they please, patients are exposed to harm on a staggering scale throughout the whole of medicine, from research to practice\\".<br />6. The book provides countless examples involving well known drugs.  Interesting stories behind them.<br />7. How the pharmaceutical industry influences doctors through false or misleading marketing, flawed trial designs and how regulators fail to regulate.<br />8. Fascinating facts interspersed throughout book, \\"We're very complicated animals, but we only have about 20,000 genes, so lots of the building blocks of the human body are used several times over, meaning that something which interferes with one target in the body might also affect another, to a greater or lesser extent, at a higher dose\\".<br />9. Interesting look at the drug-producing process.  The phases of the clinical trials.<br />10. Inside the job of a drug regulator.  The process and pressures of the job. \\"Research reviewing a long series of FDA votes found that experts are slightly more likely to vote in a company's interest if they have a financial tie to that company\\".<br />11. The reality behind accelerated approval for drugs.<br />12. Exposing fraud.  \\"There are all sorts of things we should be doing to catch outright fraud: better investigations, better routine monitoring, better communication from journal editors on suspicions about papers they reject, etc...\\"<br />13. How journals overstate results.  Manipulating the data. \\"if you chop up your data in lots of different ways, you can pull out lumpy subgroups with weird findings at will\\".<br />14. Makes the compelling case for evidence-based medicine.<br />15. The real purpose of drug reps.  \\"This is a huge business: the overwhelming majority of the industry's promotional budget goes on influencing doctors, rather than patients, and about half of that gets spent on drug reps\\".<br />16. The power of marketing, \\"when you take a step back from pharmaceutical industry marketing, it is simply a process whereby patients pay money to drug companies, in order for them to produce biased information, which then distorts treatment decisions, making them less effective\\".<br />17. The author explains what you can do as a consumer. Excellent advice.<br />18. The use of ghostwriters to influence the public.\\"Lilly set a goal of making Zyprexa `the number one selling psychotropic in history', and its emails discuss using ghostwriters to present it in a positive light...\\".<br />19. How the pharmaceutical industry uses money to buy influence and what is being done around the world to counter.  The need for full disclosure.<br />20. Links worked great!<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. The book repeats many of the same points almost to a fault.<br />2. The prose is dry at times.<br />3. The author could have done a better job of espousing some of the great science that resulted in quality of life medication.  The focus and tone of the book is almost exclusively critical.  \\"Although this book is about problems, my goal is that pharma should be adequately regulated and transparent, to the extent that academics can feel positive and enthusiastic about collaboration with it\\".<br />4. No formal bibliography, must sort through notes.<br /><br />In summary, a real eye-opening book worth reading.  Doctor Goldacre exposes an industry that needs to be reformed for the well being of humanity.  The focus of the book is to identify problems within the pharmaceutical industry and to provide pragmatic solutions with the ultimate goal of serving humanity.  The book's main ideas are repeated almost to a fault but the book is an invaluable expose of an industry that risks the well being of humans for financial gain.  I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Further suggestions: \\"[[ASIN:0865479186 Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks]]\\" by same author, \\"[[ASIN:B0049195R0 Deadly Spin]]\\" by Wendell Potter, \\"[[ASIN:B0043RSJTK The Panic Virus]]\\" by Seth Mnookin, \\"[[ASIN:B003UYUP58 The Emperor of All Maladies]]\\" by Siddhartha Mukherjee, \\"[[ASIN:1400052181 The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks]]\\" by Rebecca Skloot, \\"[[ASIN:B003RRXXO8 Merchants of Doubt]]\\" by Erik M.

1608955702|5.0|As a pro photographer, workshop leader, educator, author and all around lighting geek I consume photography lighting books the way other people eat breakfast cereal. Therefore I'm a pretty tough customer when it comes to content. I hold the bar very high and expect details, details, and more details. I look for thorough, clear explanations, behind the scenes images, diagrams, the how's, the why's, and most important - compelling images that leave me wishing I'd created them.<br /><br />Neil Van Niekerk's book delivers on all counts! \\"Direction & Quality of Light: Your Key to Better Portrait Photography Anywhere\\" is filled with page after page of inspiring images and detailed information. Neil delves not only into how images were created technically but the thought process and reasons behind his choices. The book builds on a solid foundation of important lighting theory and technique and moves quickly into a plethora of real world applications.<br /><br />This is a book by a working professional photographer for other aspiring and working photographers. No fluff, no BS, only solid, practical, real world information; just the kind of essential skills readers need in today's competitive marketplace. For these reasons I give Neil Van Niekerk's \\"Direction & Quality of Light\\" two big thumbs up and recommend it without reservation.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I've never been a big fan of the fantasy genre--this book was a delightful surprise! I love the 19th/early 20th century setting.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This novella has all the hallmarks of Sanderson's usual fantasy work ... strong characters, moral lesson, well-developed other world. However, I think he mixed a bit of Tamora Pierce in. The heroine, Shai, is strong and likeable. She lives on the edge, trying to master what some consider a &#34;questionable&#34; trade. Shai eventually wins the respect of those who initially doubted her by completing a seemingly impossible task and adding her own twist. She escapes her captor and heads ....where? I want more. A new, complete novel starring Shai. Please Brandon?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Can't wait to read another Nicholas Sparks books!! He makes you feel like your there watching them. I love how he bounces back and forth but not to whee  you are confused. My fav author for sure!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|addictive ! This series makes us live in a time of elegance, though happy to have passed on to modern times.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|They really got rolling in the third season!  The twists and turns continue.  My family hadn't seen any of this series when it originally aired, so we watched the whole thing in a month's time.  This was the point where we gave up trying to pace ourselves and started planning our lives around finishing it.  Good stuff all the way through and this was some of the best.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Excellent movie! The chase scene at the beginning of the movie was in true James Bond form. Loved it and can't wait for the next one.  And thanks for the promotion that gave me $5 off.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fantastic show! It captures a great story from an interesting perspective. I recommend this for anyone interested in a solid drama.
B00BGDQNLU|5.0|This zany film is immensely fun and rewatchable with a wonderful cast chewing the scenery for our entertainment.  Highly recommended! (I just wish the Coens would get back to making more of these light and absurd films...)
B005HED08I|5.0|This is clearly one of the best shows ever made. If you don't like Kirk, you'll like Spock. Or McCoy.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|For those lucky enough to not have read the book this season is 5 stars, for George R.R. Martin fans that have, however will most likely agree that it is a 4 star performance.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very noticeable increase in production budget, scenes are grander and the Dire wolves are done right!<br />Several scenes not in the book add to the character depth<br />Wonderful immersive story<br />Salidor San was casted perfectly<br /><br />Cons<br />Some parts it deviates much from the book, Stanis' family, the faith of Davis, and the continues relationship of renley- all go away from the book which is a disappoi ntment<br />It does feal a bit rushed as well fitting a 40+ hour book into a 10 hour season will cause that<br /><br />Summary<br />Buy it, enjoy it, but if you have the option watch this before reading the book, then go buy the book!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|It's a good show if you like sci-if, and I do, so I liked it. You will love Walter Bishop.
B000O19EWK|3.0|This movie had some lag.  There were 3 times while watching the movie that it had to reload for about 3-4 minutes.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|If you enjoy John Grisham's book, you'll enjoy this one too.  I read it in about 2 days and it kept me guessing to the end.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|By the time of release most people had heard of the story that this film is based on, if not the whole story you at least knew how it would end.  With that said, I was on the edge of my seat through the entire film. It says alot for a film and it's director when you know how it ends but are overcome with anticipation throughout the entire movie.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|This wasn't the worst Bond movie... it didn't have horrendous special effects that made you think that a high schooler filmed it in front of a green screen.<br /><br />It kept me interested, and it had some cool gadgets and twists in the plot.<br /><br />There was also the typical: way-over-the-top unexplained heroic survival scenes, beating-a-dead-horse lines to create a theme of the movie (old/traditional vs modern/new guys), and ridiculous dynamics with Bond's female interests.  But that's part of the franchise.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book.  Much better than the movie.  This is the first Nicholas Sparks book I've read and he does not disappoint.
B000OBYLVO|4.0|I think this a really good story line. A feel good holiday movie....I particularly like Jude Law's character....and I think this is my favorite Jack Black film too....
B007FEFLTO|5.0|an interesting way of reading about our history<br />Allthough I know the (his-)story I couldn't put it away<br />It's nice to get to know our own history through persons in different countries
B0077EBWVI|1.0|I had to turn this off, couldn't even finish it.  I think it's hard to improve on the original.  But as soon as Ren went into the separation of church and state, that was it for me.  So tired of endless political correctness.  And the story changed so much from the beginning....just didn't like it.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|great movie. great actors. loved it. I record this movie to every one. Action and suspense. Money can almost buy any thing.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I found this book unnecessarily too long-too much detail of the places where the events of this book take place.I feel it would have been more enjoyable if it was 50 or more pages shorter.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Meta-Learning, brilliant. one two three for five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen.
B0091HVMVO|5.0|Phillips has hit this one out of the park.  With their access to some of the finest performers of the 1960s to 1990s, they've wisely chosen to cover a broad range of the period from Bach to the the early 20th century.<br /><br />Despite having a 3000 lp and 1000 cd/sacd collection, I only had three of these performances, so this was an easy pick.<br /><br />Selections:<br />Some highlights include a fine Brandenburg on period instruments, a perfectly recorded Brahms 2nd (placing the piano correctly in size to the orchestra, a rare find), Richter's stunning Lizst concertos, and the great Elly Ameling singing Schubert.  There are surprises too, of the sort not normally found in such a collection (Messiaen, Schoenberg, even a Barber of Seville).  It's a broad enough collection for both a newcomer and someone who has been collecting for years.<br /><br />Sound:<br />The Phillips sound was unusually true to the source during the LP era (cf, DG), and that good sound finds its way onto CD here.  I wish there was more information on the remastering for this set: I'm drawing an inference that 23 of the discs were remastered just for this set, while existing masters would used for the remaining 32 discs.  No matter, the sound is uniformally very good to excellent throughout.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|This series should have been three good books but ended up five OK books. Seems author spread out the books to make money, but watered down the story in doing so. Books 1,2&3 were good reads, but 4&5 were the worst books that I have read in a long time.  Wish I hadn't read them and stopped at 3.
B000HZEE64|5.0|The story, writing, acting and value of entertainment is excellent.  Great cast, crew and production!  I highly recommend this to men and boys.
B003UESJF6|5.0|The whole family loves this movie - it's funny and provided quite a few quotable lines for our quote loving daughters.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|it was an easy game that kept my interest<br />that I will probably play again. thank you for making reasonably priced games.
B000HL0EEE|4.0|I like the writing and the stories of the series,  I like the interaction between the actors,<br /><br />never had the opportunity to see when it was made,<br /><br />it has been enjoyable to have the chance to watch it,<br /><br />Thank you Amazon
B000PC6A3E|5.0|The quality is amazing, the film is amazing, the purchase is amazing. Feel free to buy this with confidence, friends.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This is a very moving film and Denzel is at his best!  I highly recommend it to anyone.  You won't be disappointed.
0802473164|4.0|Very helpful information. Recommended by my therapist. I agree with her. I would recommend this book to anyone who is married.
B006JRY2QG|4.0|I think its a really good series from start to finish this season will have you hooked. Characters are believable and the plot is fun.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I do not review books often.  In the case of Blood Song, however, I felt that I needed to add my own voice to the already incredible weight of positive reviews the book has seen thus far.  It is an amazing work that has revived my interest in the fantasy genre.  If you are undecided about purchasing Blood Song, I cannot stress strongly enough how thoroughly I enjoyed it.  Waiting for the sequel is going to be torture.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Forget the rest of her novels. Due to Austen's limited society the themes remain startingly similiar and the characters repeat. Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy however, deserve your undivided attention.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|It is great to see a series that is based on history and is very entertaining.  I highly recommend it.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|We are using this to help teach our 6 year old about moon phases for school.  Works great on the Kindle Fire.
0765325950|5.0|Ah, the joy of closure. What a great series! I started reading this series so long ago, it is so nice to say that I have finished this series. I almost hate to write this, but I prefer the Sanderson books to Jordan.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Our kids love these games, and I'm amazed how quickly they pick it up.  Excellent all around for all ages.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Christina is such a powerful singer! I got it really because of the duet with her and Blake Shelton, but her other songs are terrific as well!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Our kids love these games, and I'm amazed how quickly they pick it up.  Excellent all around for all ages.
0316227706|5.0|This beautiful book of photos provides endless enjoyment. Pick up the book anytime and thumb through the pages -- you will wind up with a smile on your face. For anyone who loves dogs and/or photography.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Excellent album with touches of old school rock and modern sensibility.  Great album for the kids to rock out and dance to.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I love the lite humor mixed with serious subject matter. All your characters jell. I especially enjoy Ezpecito. and his partner interaction.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I love this app!  I like the website and this app is very accurate and informative.  The best weather app I have found so far!
B003TH14H4|5.0|I love the lite humor mixed with serious subject matter. All your characters jell. I especially enjoy Ezpecito. and his partner interaction
0765325950|5.0|We have waited what seems like forever to finally have this final volume of a most beloved series of books.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm not a fan of sequels, however, this series has captured me, and my heart is fully engaged in the riveting, unacceptable plot.  This story keeps twisting/turning and delivering breath-holding action that taunts the reader, wondering what will be next. A plot like this makes the reader ponder how it was conceived, and if it could ever be possible; what if?  While reading this series, my dreams have been very imaginative and vibrant.  In my opinion, the author has done it again, well done!
B00ABXA1HI|1.0|Sattelite dish imprint on my PC Identifier name makes the assumption that I'm trying to attach an additional PC to my copy of the software, which I'm not. Support gave me a number of possible solutions to try and none of them worked.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Indiana Jones is by far my favorite trilogy.  He's the original action/adventure hero. I am quite pleased with the Blu-Ray remastering.  It looks great.  Only problem with this was that it came with the Crystal Skull, but now I've got a new beer coaster, so it works out in the end
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was considering buying a new larger calculator for my desk but instead I decided to just download the app. Fits my needs exactly. Plain, simple, easy to use and fill the entire screen of my Kindle. Excellent choice.
B003U53GK8|3.0|The ending was not very satisfying.  I was really left bewildered by what the whole meeting in the church was about.
B008W31IFS|3.0|Mickey Haller has spent most of his life as a defense attorney. So imagine his surprise when the District Attorney appoints him as Special Prosecutor and assigns him to retry Jason Jessup, who was convicted 24-years ago for the kidnapping and strangulation murder of 12-year-old Melissa Landy. Jessup armed with new attorneys, newly discovered evidence (DNA technology), and new support (the Justice Project), wants his day in court. Who else would Haller depend on but his half-brother/Homicide Detective Harry Bosch and his feisty ex-wife/prosecutor Maggie McPherson to help him try Jessup? As the prosecution team tries to unearth new evidence, and prepare the only eyewitness to the abduction (Sarah, Melissa's young sister), they must also contend with a slick defense attorney, the media and politics galore. Overall, this was a quick and easy read, but I just wished Connelly would have given me a more satisfying ending and not, well....cheated us. While it answered a lot of questions, it also left me feeling somewhat satisfied. I am not sure if it was because it was focused more so on trying Jessup, and skirted over the characters that we have become invested in over the years (Bosch & Haller, Maggie, their daughters, etc), but regardless, I didn't think that this was one of Connelly's best. But for those who are fans of the series, they will enjoy reading it if for no other reason than finally getting an opportunity to see the cousins meet.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I read all the time and have liked almost everything written by Michael Connelly. Stories now and then ebb and flow at their own pace, as did this one.  I recommend this kindle edition and although I wish the ending had drawn out alittle further, I did enjoy it. I can't wait for the next book from this author.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This show still holds up as one of the best sci-fi tv series of all time, despite being limited to only 1 season. Watching this again after missing it for a few years, I can easily see why the show still has such avid fans, and why the actors still talk about the show as if they would hope it could come back.<br /><br />From the technical side, it streamed seamlessly, the HD quality was good, and there were only a couple hiccups for buffering, which could easily have been from my own personal internet.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone (even the non-sci-fi fan!)
B005K01VZS|5.0|I truly enjoyed this read.  Though I belong to a different religion, the understandings and teachings in this easy read was comprehended clearly.  If we all could take something from the teachings of people like Reb, the world would be a much better place.<br /><br />I enjoyed it.  Thank you
B006LA6IW2|5.0|Such a great American. God bless you and your family. I hope the peace that only God can provide touches  your family.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Super story that takes you through all the real emotions of a thriller. Can't ait for the next one to hit the shelves.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Kept my interest through the whole book.  The characters  in the book were really exciting.  I love David Baldacchi's books.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book i will totally be reading it again. It was a very inspiring book :)! I think anybody would enjoy it really.
0385751532|5.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a very interesting and well-written novel. The author used lots of adjectives and very colorful language. He used elements of literature such as similes and metaphors. The story is about a boy named Bruno whose dad is the commandant at the concentration camp Auschwitz. Bruno finds himself desperate to explore the camp (which is strictly forbidden). Once he finally escapes the house and goes to the camp, he sees a little boy named Shmuel sitting on the other side of the fence. Throughout the story Bruno and Shmuel, meet every day at the fence. Near the end of the story, Bruno is leaving the camp, so Bruno and Shmuel decide to go on an adventure. This adventure ends surprisingly. Read the book to understand the full adventure of The Boy in The Striped Pajamas.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|The book took me a few chapters to get into bit once I did...  lots of turns in the case leaving you guessing until the very end!  Can't wait to read book number 2 to see the detective grow!
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I found out some of the references to the Rotunda were factual and I had never heard of them before.  Kept me wanting to keep reading through to the end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this is a great game and the best possible way to be better is to use a computer to program it
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I was told this was funny.  I was so disappointed.  There were few funny moments but it was just not worth the rental fee.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This game is great, but it begs for money. Diamonds give good items, but you can get them later in the game. All units are there, and you can get them all later. You don't need to whip out your credit card for units, so don't. Everything else about it is amazing though. Great game. 4
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book grabbed me from the first page and kept me interested to the end.  While you might be able to predict the ending the way it ended was unexpected.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Follows along nicely with the other stargate series. I really enjoy this kind of show. Would have rather had the actors from SG1  but  it is still a great series
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Not much into the whole British TV scene, but I caught a third season episode with a family member and got hooked. Went back and watched the first two season in 3 days.<br /><br />Fantastic. Dramatic, but not overly so. Often funny, but also very well developed characters that you get really strong feelings for, good or bad.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend.
B005HSL626|5.0|Another great game for the young and old.the graphics and sounds are wonderful.it is so simple and fast but lots of fun.My fingers get a good work out.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Loved this movie as a kid! It's a classic that will never grow old. I still think they should of given an Academy Award to the SHARK who did such an outstanding mechanical performance!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is fun,fun until my son takes the game away.(he wants to play)There is nothing wrong with this game.This is one I would pay for,I just love it
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|I haven't seen any of the older episodes of Dr. Who and don't really feel like I am missing too much.  There are definitely references to things from previous episodes/season, but overall they explain anything you should know.<br /><br />Its an entertaining show, fun sci fi but not too serious either.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Well written, fast-paced, if just a tad unbelievable in the quickness of the love story.  Overall, a good light read.
B002YCVWXQ|4.0|The Inglorious Basterds held up to my expectations.  The story was well written, the acting was superb and the movie well directed. It was a little long, but stay with it, this movie is well worth it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey has an excellent historical story line.  I enjoy the interactions among the characters both upstairs and downstairs.  Can't wait to see what happens next.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|This was a decent outdoor movie! My husband the hunter liked it too.  Can't say much more than that, for a free movie, it was great. Thanks Amazon.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I like the varied subject matter and the lineup of speakers is quite impressive. Sometimes I am not in the mood to deal with the news and don't want to watch a movie. TED Conferences can be the perfect way to pass some time, learn something and be entertained. It's your choice what to watch. Very worthwhile.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Easy to use and does what it is supposed to do<br /> I would suggest anyone to get it I use it everyday
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The good things about Facebook are really good. Topping the list of not good things is the necessity for constant vigilance to make certain yet another 'update/upgrade' has not wiped out my privacy settings. More than once FB users have discovered they are automatically opted 'in' to a new open port hole through which personal information is freely available. It is up to you to go through the often confusing pages and options to select the level of privacy you want. Let's face it, the internet is a shark pond and most of us are minnows. Your job, however futile, is to keep on top of what the world is learning about you. Some people want to sell you something and some people want to steal your identity and rob you blind. Just be careful.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Excellent show.  Missed seeing this season. Wish there was more segments. Each season gets better. Looking forward to next year
B004G6TD8Y|4.0|I love this rendition of one of my favorite classic pieces. I saw ELP may years ago, and Keith Emerson played excerpts from his own piano concerto, so technically he knows how to express the nuances of a classi.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is easy to use. Unlike many other apps, it works on the kindle fire hd and doesn't malfunction. Probably one of the best calculator apps I have seen!
B008BDZOZY|4.0|I have followed David Byrne through all of his years and styles. He always puts out a quality sound and imaginative lyrics. He has colaborated with many fine artists and this CD is no different. Annie Erin Clark &#34;St. Vincent&#34; lends her tremendous vocal and musical talent to this collection. Even my wife, a &#34;pop&#34; junkie enjoyed the catchy tunes and vocals on this one. Definitely worth a listen.
B009Z8HPYM|5.0|Perhaps the best Neil yet.  The interwoven video is astounding, the music is the great sound you get when Crazy Horse is there and the lyrics show that Neil has matured into his full genius.  Walk Like a Giant is very possibly the best ever.
B00296A4F4|5.0|This show was recommended to me by my kids (young adults) and they were right - it's a fun show
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I have been following Big Bang Theory not since it started, but after seeing an episode at a Game store. I couldn't stop laughing and absolutely love the series. I look forward to the newest episode to be downloaded in my Amazon Prime and watch it. I greatly recommend this series.
B00BHMF578|3.0|A bit self indulgent, somewhat predictable, not finely nuanced or full of compelling performances but has an interesting storyline and a few entertaining characters (Arkin) that make for a decent movie.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|This really was an awful lot of money for a cheap piece of plastic, not worth the money at all.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|This was a gift for my sister for her birthday last year.<br />We watch the show together now.<br />I wasn't into it at first, but now it's pretty interesting.<br />If you like drama and mystery, buy this.<br />SHH! Someone might be watching, hopefully it's not A.
0307949486|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson takes its time to get moving, but once the two main characters of Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander meet, the narrative really zips along. There is an intriguing mystery at the core of the plot involving the disappearance of a young woman several decades before, and as the story unravels, so do the lies and secrets of the wealthy family who hired Blomkvist and Salander. Much fuss has been made about Lisbeth Salander, and she certainly is a unique character, but Larsson leaves her mostly an intriguing enigma. There is enough suspense, action, thrilling twists, and bits of violence to keep the reader fully engaged through the bulk of the book before it slows and drags a bit as it pulls together the loose threads. A strong start for the trilogy.
B005IUP624|5.0|\\"Unbearable Lightness\\" is an extraordinary book and I admire Portia's raw honesty, which is the foundation of this memoir. Many actresses have briefly mentioned struggles with an eating disorder but Portia's direct, factual writing gives valuable insight into the mind of an active anorexic. She speaks in the voice of someone deeply in the throes of anorexia, giving the reader access to the dysfunctional mindset of a woman starving herself to death and thinking she's doing the right thing. Without pulling any punches or glamorizing her agonizing struggle, Portia describes how she unwittingly slipped from 'normal' dieting, battling weight gain, into what ultimately became a battle for her life. Literally. When reading this book, you cannot help but feel tremendous sympathy for a young woman who tortured herself (body and soul) out of insecurity and a pathological need to fit in and be accepted in the dreadful world of show business. It's a miracle that Portia is still alive after annihilating her body to such extremes, as the reader finds out. \\"Unbearable Lightness\\" is a book that can literally change, or even save, someone's life because Portia speaks to us with such unfiltered truth. Her honesty would not have been as effective if she weren't the excellent writer that she clearly is. I'm so glad she was able to recover and meet the love of her life, whom we all know is the wonderful Ellen Degeneres. However, this is not a tale of \\"sick today, cured tomorrow.\\" This was a serious life-or-death battle for Portia. I wish everyone - male or female - who obsesses over their physical appearance could read this book to see what a slippery slope and ultimate dead-end it is to base your worth on your looks and what others think of you. It's simply not worth it. If someone as gorgeous as Portia De Rossi suffered from such intense insecurity, it shows how hopeless and harmful vanity can be. I hope she knows what a tremendous service she did for those with similar struggles by sharing her story so honestly. I recommend this book to anyone with intense issues over vanity, weight, insecurity and self-worth. Trust me, you'll be glad you read about Portia's journey through darkness and ultimate triumph.
0307949508|5.0|Being the second book of a trilogy, The Girl Who Played with Fire by Stieg Larsson doesn't in any way suffer from the sophomore slump. Where the first novel was more about Mikael Blomkvist, here it is Lisbeth Salander who is front and center, and deservedly so. The more Larsson reveals about her past and personality, the more interesting she seems. Events set in motion in the first novel, and schemes devised when Lisbeth Salander was merely a child, begin to come to a head as conspiracies unravel and Lisbeth sets her eyes on vengeance. Blomkvist is still an important player, but this one's all about Lisbeth, and it's a thrilling read from the beginning to the shockingly abrupt end.
0446580848|5.0|Hey, its Nelson Demille and John Corey, it doesnt get any better than that.  Cant wait for the next one.
0307454568|4.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest by Stieg Larsson picks up just hours after the shocking events that concluded the second novel and deftly manages to slow the pace without losing its momentum. All of the backstory, characters, and pieces of the conspiracy surrounding Lisbeth Salander from the first two novels converge and emerge in this final installment. Having Lisbeth be in recovery from the events of the second novel seemed at first like a risky move, but it's just as compelling to see her trounce people with her intellect as opposed to her combat skills. Secrets and twists abound as everything that Larsson has been meticulously unfolding finally comes fully to light. A great read which cements Lisbeth Salander as one of the great characters of this new century.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|Loved the first three books but was disappointed with Feast for Crows.<br />Should have made it a TRILOGY.WON'T PURCHASE BOOK 5.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was really reluctant on reading this book, because I am against kids killing kids!!! However, I started watching the movie one night & wasn't able to finish it & I was very intrigued from the little bit was able to watch!!! From the very beginning of the book I was hooked & haven't been able to put it down!!! I read the ENTIRE book today!!! Looking forward to reading the second book!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|My son and I are both playing this game. He absolutely loves it. I like it too. It is fun building your Dragon's layer. You have lots of options to choose from. There are many types of Dragons.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|The first part is really easy, however as one progresses it becomes more challanging to meet or exceed other's scores from wherever they come from.  I often play it when I sense That I will have a few minutes to kill and not really enough time to get back to the story that I had been reading - it is not complex and it can be a lot of fun.
B005OP7162|5.0|Got sucked into revenge. Stirring story about deception, tension between the rich and not so rich, conspiracy, betrayal and revenge.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|If this did not say James Bond and have Q in it I would have never know what I was watching. Boring.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is an amazing game that is so addicting thats its hard to stop playing! Kids will enjoy and its a good racing game like Temple Run and Temple Run Brave.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|I love all the Rogers-Hammerstein musicals.  They are uplifting, sometimes historical, sometimes funny and ALWAYS GREAT! I encourage YOU to read it!  You'll love it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing story! Discusses war and trial in a very real way, but in way that the younger set can understand the struggles.
B00ATTFGXS|5.0|Stopwatch Xtreme does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well.  I use it for timing guitar practice and the &#34;lap&#34; function works perfectly:  5 minutes of warm up, 10-15 minutes of exercises, 10 minutes learning a song, etc.  The software has worked for me without a glitch or crash.  Highly recommended.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|It's a rare jewel, a fantasy story with bristling with unique ideas, great humour and deep philosophy. Granted, story within the story approach might not appeal to everyone. Furthermore, just like its predecessor, Wise Man's Fear does not have the usual epic story structure, so many would find it unfocused. This is not a story of a quest, or great adventure. Sometimes entire months of Kvothe's adventures are skimmed over in favour of one important conversation or recount of an odd tale, which in opinion only adds to the uniqueness and emotional strength of the book.<br /><br />Wise Man's Fear is an acquired taste. Savour it.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Briliiant series<br />Great fun and some crazy ideas - always engaging and thoughtful plots<br />Really deserves a whole day to see the episodes back to back
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I love horses and I collect movies about horses. This is a great addition to my collection. Very beautiful and moving movie

B006VFLIYK|5.0|All the elements of a good read, brings you in just at right pace, builds and builds increasing the drama, you become attached to the characters, your off to the races... You are constantly updating your own &#34;what ifs&#34; surprised yet validated in the end. A Very Good Read!!!
B0094AH3MU|4.0|There is a lot of \\"Good\\" in this performance of Verdi's 11th opera. Particularly of note is the singing of the lead singers, the chorus, and the orchestral work of the Teatro di San Carlo Orchestra under Maestro Niccola Luisotti. As to the particulars ...<br /><br />Tenor Aquiles Machado does a fine job with the frequently demanding role of Carlo. While I prefer the vocal performance of Carlo Bergonzi on the Philips CD set (I think that Bergonzi was the top Verdi tenor of his time),I have enjoyed Machado's performance in a deleted TDK Rigoletto, and enjoyed this one  enough to look forward to the C Major release of Forza, with Machado as Alvaro. His spinto voice is nearly perfect for the tenor roles that Verdi wrote during the galley years.<br /><br />Soprano Lucrezi Garcia is a promising vocal talent who carries off the coloratura runs, trills and pianissimi quite well, although her physical size and near total lack of acting ability, are off putting. Her voice is evenly produced through her extended range with no signs of forcing, although there are some glottal attacks that her coach should address before they get too set in her technique.<br /><br />Baritone Artur Rucinski was very effective as the evil Francesco, with dramatic skills that were quite effective (think \\"leer and sneer\\") His mid voice reminded me of someone who sang in the mid late 20th century, and I will have to play some CDs to get a more precise fix on that, but Piero Cappuccilli comes to mind.<br /><br />Now for the \\"Bad\\": staging. I simply cannot figure out why modern stage directors do what they do. What possible value is there in mutilating a work that has been performed since 1847? Admittedly, Schiller's Die Rauber, which I have not read nor intend to, was a creation of the Romanticism of the 19th century, and given that Verdi created what Berger (\\"Verdi With A Vengeance\\") terms a \\"very disjointed work\\". But if the work is to be staged, rather than presented in concert, why not defer to the traditional, rather than produce an approach that intensifies the disjointed aspects of the opera as written?<br /><br />In this disc, the robbers run around in costumes that are from several historical periods, brandishing firearms dating from WW I to the present ( with an appalling lack of safe handling practices: I'd hit the deck if someone pointed an automatic weapon at me with his finger on the trigger!!). Then, when Francesco kills himself, he uses a knife rather than a more effective pistol. So does Carlo when he offs Amalia! Go Figure!<br /><br />Someone needs to get Ms. Garcia into a weight loss program. I know that I'm being \\"insensitive\\" (I am frequently) and non-PC (ditto!), but the dramatic \\"connection\\" between Carlo and Amalia suffers from the girth issue. It reminded me of a simpler time where operatic performances involved large people who stood in one place and did the park and bark thing. Good opera today has gotten past that stage (pun intended).<br /><br />Finally, the \\"Ugly\\"; the set. A bunch of stage lights on poles, a backstage that had a skull (reminiscent of the \\"Punisher\\" T shirt my older son got for me to upgrade my wardrobe), an upholstered chair sitting by itself in the middle of the stage. The set said nothing and was a huge, ugly distraction!<br /><br />Having noted all of the above, gentle reader, being the Verdiholic that I am, I would not want to be without this opera. I am one of those who believes that lesser Verdi trumps most anything else. The music and the singing here all are very, very good, and while I do like to listen to CDs (and do so a lot) I enjoy the visual experience more, even when it is less than what I might prefer. BTW, picture and sound are excellent, and the personal microphones, while evident, do not distract me much at all.<br /><br />In sum, this is a less than perfect opera whose lack of perfection is intensified by set and staging. But it is Verdi, so what more can I say?

B003UBTX6S|5.0|Beautiful darkness was an amazing book, definetly a page turner. The love Lena and Ethan share is incredible, and they are willing to go across the face of the earth to show it.

B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Sufficiently creepy to warrant turning on the lights to watch.  Ethan Hawke was great to watch.  Visually fresh imagery.  The soundtrack was by far the film's best asset.
0061148512|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Honest, raw, beautiful writing. Sylvia Plath shows why she is still read, studied, and talked about today.
B003B02OOG|5.0|Had me reading several of the stories to my wife aloud.  Excellent Grisham writing and perfect for short commute reading.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Seamlessly tying together the gritty and modern interpretation of James Bond, that Daniel Craig has ushered in, with the old-school,  globe trotting, effortless cool of the Connery years.  Deftly finding a delicate balance between old and new to create something that is both refreshing and familiar in equal measure.  It elevates the bar and sets the stage for more high-quality James Bond adventures for years to come.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I went into the book thinking it was just erotica.  I fell in love with all the characters and cried several times.  Definitely worth my time and money!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I don't really care much about horses or anything but, this game is very fun and easy to use.  Also, it's a good time-waster.  Would definitely recommend.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|A compulsive and delicious read, full of twists and surprises.  Loved the drama of family secrets and the way all the intertwined stories fit perfectly into the puzzle's conclusion.  Haven't read such a romantically creepy and suspenseful book since du Maurier's Rebecca.  Milderhust is the new Manderley.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I was thrown after a few chapters because the beginning was different for Grisham.  As I continued, I was blown away with the plot and had to go back to see what signals I missed.  I loved it!!!
B005IQZB14|5.0|What a tremendous story, journaling a women's struggle to find her place in life.  Left me wanting more - what's going to happen next?
B006MW3UZW|4.0|In spite of the fact that the plot is predictable and the &#34;meanwhile back at the ranch&#34; senarios, it is extremely well acted and well worth watching.  I will watch it again in a few weeks.  WELL DONE!
B001O1O71C|5.0|Amazing  so much feel it made feel like I was going to cry setting was also amazing it made me feel like I was actually there
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|This is definitely a keep you on the edge of your seat type of movie!  My husband and I are old enough to remember the actual events of this movie, and yet we were still mesmerized by the story and how it was potrayed by these extremely talented actors!
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|This made no sense whatever.  Was too far into the realm of the absurd.  I would have trouble believing this would ever happen on a real US airline.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|What a good movie...as expected, Denzel is brilliant as Captain Whip Whitaker.  My husband and I started watching Flight when we were flying home from vacation, not a good idea, as we hit some bad weather.  This movie is best watched sitting earthbound!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Very fun and addictive. Only downside is internet connection required.wait times are reasonable. Your money, food, and gems never expire.
B003H4I4JU|2.0|Jaws 2 was a movie that never needed to be made. The original Jaws was so stunning and jaw droppingly awesome, no sequel was needed, nor did a sequel make sense. I think you can say the same for the Speaker of the Dead. Just like Jaws, how do you follow up a book like Ender's Game and make it believable? Orson Scott Card gave it a valient effort, but with no logical progression for a sequel, Speaker for the Dead flounders in the water where Ender's Game attacked the Orca and sank it to the bottom.<br /><br />People of earth are sent to different planets to learn about the creatures living there while not revealing too much<br />about human kind. When one human learns too much about this group called the &#34;Piggies&#34;, he is found dead in a field. The person responsible sends a call for a &#34;Speaker of the Dead&#34;, to find out what happened. Ender, one of the speakers, shows up on this planet and begins to investigate these not one, but ...gasp... two mysterious deaths.<br /><br />So, what makes Speaker fall short? Well, for one the stakes are a lot lower. In the first book Earth is in Jeopardy of being destroyed. Here we have a couple of deaths of humans who seem to be sticking there noses in where they don't belong. Is it really logical that because of the guilt that the humans felt because of the buggers, that they would travel to other planets to learn about them? Wouldn't it make more sense for us just to let them live their lives?<br /><br />Secondly, is how we are presented with information. In Ender's Game, we learn about Ender through battle scenes, fight scenes, and his actions in the computer game. We learn about little Andrew through exciting situations. Even when there is no action, there is tension between the characters. Ender is always doing something while were learning about him which drives the story along. In Speaker, we learn about Ender's thoughts while traveling through space, talking with a priest, talking with a family, talking with a little boy and walking around. Even though we have these &#34;mysterious&#34; deaths hanging over us, there's nothing to drive the dialogue and consequently nothing to drive the action. After a while the mystery isn't enough to keep you reading further.<br /><br />Finally, and most importantly, is the use of Ender. Ender was an absolutely brilliant millitary leader, not to mention a tough little kid. In Speaker, the boy who once took on kids twice his size and won, beat more experienced kids in battle games and SAVED THE WORLD, is slightly older, a little wiser and a whole lot more boring. It would be like taking Sigourney Weaver from the first alien and having the rest of the sequels featuring her in a lab disecting and teaching about the alien. Or having Rocky Balboa become a politician who fights to open up a YMCA boxing program. It might make sense from a logical perspective, but not at all from a fantasy perspective. You don't read sequels for reality, you read them because you want to see Ripley take on more aliens, or watch Rocky get punch in the face some more.<br /><br />Sequels are for people who want to see the same movie or read the same book again. However, there in lies the problem. Some books and movies are setup for a sequel and some are written to stand alone. Brody destroyed the shark, Ripley launched the Alien out of the airlock and Ender beat the buggers. You can appreciate what Card tried to do with Speaker, but it's not the same kind of book. None of these classic movies needed sequels and neither did Ender's Game.little boy and walking around.

0375422889|5.0|I saw the movie based on Marjane Satrapi's childhood and young adult experiences years ago, but both her &#34;Persepolis&#34; books fill in the gaps.  &#34;Persepolis 2&#34; begins when Satrapi has left Iran to be educated in Vienna.  She shows with wisdom and humor the culture shock a young person experiences.  However, the book shows how the protagonist fell prey not only to the temptations of sex but drugs as well.  She had even dealt drugs for a time.<br />Back in Iran, Satrapi must readjust to a more repressive government.  One &#34;fill-in&#34; is that she was arrested at one time for simply wearing red socks!  The film ended with the impression that Satrapi never returned to Iran, but the book tells us otherwise, and that she had seen her wise grandmother one last time before she died.

140053271X|2.0|This is an update from my initial review.<br /><br />This Barnes & Noble Nook Simple Touch was advertised by BlueProton at Amazon as having been marked down from $249.99 to $68.99, so it certainly seemed like a great deal. It now seems like fraudulent advertising because I've since read that the MSRP is $79.99<br /><br />Initially I had serious problems with the Nook, and requested a refund. The seller, BlueProton, refused to take returns or give a refund for it, and directed me to Barnes & Noble who referred me back to the seller, stating  that the seller should refund it within 14 days; at that time  I'd only had it a few days. My Amazon A to Z claim ended with Amazon siding with the seller, BlueProton because their policy stated that they would not accept returns on Nooks - something I did not see when I initially read their policy!<br /><br />Because neither BlueProton nor Barnes & Noble would take responsibility for the defective product, and their attitude was \\"Take the money and run!\\", I'm giving the Nook a low review although later I found an update for the Nook which resolved the problems - with no help or information from either seller or Barnes & Noble!<br /><br />I now enjoy using the Nook which is so much easier and more comfortable to hold than regular books while reading,  and to carry back & forth to work each day or to travel with. I don't like the gray screen which requires you to face the Nook towards the light; and I don't like the glare on the screen from the sun or lights. I have to sit \\"just so\\" to read it - which somewhat defeats the idea of portability. Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.<br /><br />My favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles! Most of my library's digital books are in ePub format which is the native format of the Nook. However, as other reviewers have stated, you can still borrow or buy Kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to ePub via the free Calibre software. Borrowed library books can be returned automatically when the loan periods expire, or can be returned manually earlier if you decide not to finish the book during the loan period.<br /><br />Ordinarily I don't buy many fiction books because I rarely read any of them more than once. Additionally, due to the poor customer service from both Amazon (who owns Kindle) and Barnes & Noble (who owns Nook) I am determined to rarely buy any books from either of these companies, and will primarily download either their free books or the library's loan books. The companies want us to buy their ebooks, but won't take responsibility for their e-readers, so that infuriates me and alienates me for life.<br /><br />The pros: the low price; comfort; convenience; savings from being able to borrow library books instead of buying something you'll only read once; no clutter of physical books; easy loaning to friends with a guarantee that they will be returned in 14 days (automatic returns); ability to read multiple formats via conversion in free Calibre software. The Nook can also read your PDF files/documents from your PC or elsewhere, plus it can use your JPEG files of photos to use as your custom screensavers; the Nook will convert them to B&W.<br /><br />The cons: PlueProton's and Barnes & Nobles's total lack of responsibility for their defective Nooks - why I gave the Nook such a low rating; Amazon's siding with Blue Proton's irresponsible returns policy; dreary gray screen which makes it difficult to read except in bright lighting; touch screen not as sensitive and responsive as it should be - often have to touch the screen a few timesbefore getting a response.<br /><br />Over all I'm pleased with my Nook Simple Touch now that I managed to FIX IT BY MYSELF, but the companies' irresponsible policies have soured me towards them for life.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I don't know why I didn't watch this show when it first came on but I'm sure glad I started now.  Fantastic show!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Although the subject matter is \\"after school special\\" material, the book is written in such a way that you don`t feel like you are reading a sappy depressing novel. Although it`s about death and dying, it isn't a sad book ; it is uplifting and thought provoking .
0670026603|5.0|I bought this book on a whim and loved it.  I don't think there is much more I can say about it that the other reviews didn't cover.  Just know this book is one you will keep thinking about long after you've finished it.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|This Book has very interesting characters. I liked the colorfulness and comical circumstance the characters tend to  get themselves in. Definitely a good read for young and old.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved watching Downton Abbey and can't wait till season 3 is available. I love period series but in general this one is particularly captivating with its beautiful scenery and gripping scandals :)
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Great show - far better than the abysal 3rd Terminator movie, and much more in line with the tone of the first two films.
B004498KPU|5.0|Classic MJ short films combined in a DVD collection set. This a MUST buy.<br />Michael Jackson's vision is a masterpiece!
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|Look - if you like Helloween - just buy the album already - it doesn't disappoint.  They continue to rock as only they can.
B00B6DTIGW|5.0|Love it!  You gotta buy this one!  Well worth it in SD or HD. I want to watch again right now!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really amazing it gets really adicting though once you start to play this game you cant put it down I am a teenager playing it on my kindle and my mom always yells at me cause I cant put this game down
B003L77GH4|5.0|This i bought for my daughter and myself. I got season one for Christmas and i have never missed an episode and now my 11 years old daughter has started watching them too. love it!!
B00138KGCK|3.0|Xgau says that the \\"overproduction\\" suits Cohen's vulgarity well.  I disagree: his later mannered, heavlily Mandraxed performances suit the material much better.  All of these songs come across a lot better in (for example) the BBC concert of 68, the Isle of Wight in 1970, or Jerusalem 72--prolific the man is not.<br /><br />Leonard Cohen is about as cool as cool can be.  Bob Dylan dedicates his songs to him (c.f. Isis on Biograph) and (evidently) wrote \\"I'm not there\\" in awestruck emulation of the man--this after Dylan conquered the world and retired.  Cohen's songs on the album are perfect.  As my Norton Anthology said, 'Suzanne' is one of the few songs which works as well as a song as it does as poetry.  This recording is sort of William Shatner, though.  Cohen didn't learn how to put them over until much later.  Frankly I always wished he would ditch the band; he doesn't need backup ladies and strings.<br /><br />I just spent my $9.99 here and I have to say I vastly prefer what I can find for free.  If this was all you could get on vinyl in the late 60's, so be it; I respect that, and I would have loved it too.  Certain songs are fully realized, like \\"one of us cannot be wrong,\\" although that one is a little too received-dylan.  I do think this is his best material; \\"new skin\\" is not up to the standard of \\"Suzanne.\\"  But neither is anything else.
B002ZG997C|5.0|My dad and I were talking about this show and i wanted to see it again so i bought it.
B005H9B44A|3.0|Not bad for free on Amazon Instant Videos.  At least watching it made the Avengers movie make some more sense.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|It came a week earlier than I expected, and it was packaged great. The disks and case were in perfect condition a great show to watch with teh family... without kids of course. lol
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Once again SW surpasses our senses. Listening to this masterpiece is mindboggling. A simple note will activate the urge to listen to the whole album.  Prog has its legacy! Outstanding.
B0024FAR5M|4.0|It came 1 week earlier than expected which is always great, also it was packaged tight and well. No scratches on disk and the case was in near perfect condition, it still had the plastic from when it was once opened which was kind of annoying to take off other than that the DVD Season1 set is amazing the only season on Sons of Anarchy to have spanish dialogue. All other season alas have only spanish subtitles.
B0006LZPLC|5.0|Very durable and comfortable. Wear them anywhere. I got them for my trip to the Phillipines.  They look as great as they wear.
0470474874|5.0|Very helpful with tips & tricks as well as a DVD with Excel sheet examples of each chapters walk through topics.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|The idea is to move your sleep walking character back to bed while collecting stars and moons along the way.
1423113381|4.0|Rick Riordan is a great writer and this book is really good however i rather enjoy his percy jackson books a lot more
B004L9MFM2|5.0|loved the way you explore the different charaters. thouroughly enjoyed. i did not want to put it down. didn't have enough time in the day to keep reading.
B004X4QW42|5.0|great action but also ties morals and honor into the movie very nicely, good conquers evil and patience and intelligence wins
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The best, fast, no problem, good communication, recommended one hundred percent, the shipment arrived on time and as described above,
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a very intoxicating game... very very much so.  ★★★  FREE but easy to earn coins to upgrade. The posible combinations of breeding dragons is random enough to keep it exciting'
B0049P1VHS|5.0|The best, fast, no problem, good communication, recommended one hundred percent, the shipment arrived on time and as described above,
B000BFH2S2|3.0|I can only play the DVD on my laptop. Every time I pop it in the DVD player, it will not work. Apparently there's some kind of ''zone code''. WTF? If I change the ''zone'' on my DVD player, my others may not run. This ''zone'' bit is BS. Not Buble's fault, don't know if Seller knows but buyers beware!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is a great movie for those who enjoy watching modern choirs and good music. Kids are very funny and talented.
B0000CAXID|5.0|The beginnings of a great band here, a peak inside Dave's mind as he pretty much played every instrument on the album.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|The overall game is okay, but not very kid friendly when it comes to buying coins to play the game. The coins are not \\"play money\\", you have to purchase the coins to play and my 8 year old daughter purchased the coins without knowing it was real money! Thank goodness amazon was generous to give us a refund so beware, don't buy the coins unless you plan on actually spending money.
B00BHU261S|4.0|Very entertaining the plot and the movie kept me enthralled throughout the movie, Very well acted and scripted. Would watch again.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Moving story about what the team went through emotionally and physically. Liked every minute of it. Would recommend to anyone.
B006LMMN8I|5.0|A friend turned me on to this excellent performer and, very soon everyone will know Gregory Porter! His music soothes my soul. This is true music!! I love it!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I would give it 5 stars but I spent 7.99 and didn't get proper amount  to buy cards on bingo blitz  I should have gotten 80 but i only got 20
B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie is amazing. This is one of my most favorite movies that I have ever seen.  Sandra Bullock is an amazing actress. I could watch her movies often. What a moving movie.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Thought the movie was terrific -- on the edge of my seat the whole time. Ben Affleck -- you are back big time !
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|was a good but predictable story line with good acting by Denzel, but I really don't think it was good enough for an best picture oscar nomination.
B007N85POS|5.0|I would recommend this game to any person that that has a tablet. I play this game at least once a day!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It was a good book mostly with a good plot.  However, I found myself starting to skim the sex scenes as most of them were the same thing over and over. I also started to pick up on certain words being used often - redundant.  Mentally, I changed the word(s)...murmur-my newly hated word. Book was not a disaster but cld have been better.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|My daughter told me about this movie and I loved it. It was emotional towards the end. I absolutely recommend this movie.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|Not anything like the Bourne movies but it was okay.  I guess this way we know that we already knew, that there are other people in the program.  Sure miss Jason.  Nothing can compair.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The first collection of the six episodes of the ever popular Star Wars Saga is worth every ounce of praise it has received. Mr. George Lucas and his team of professionals deserve kudos for their significant contribution to world culture.<br /><br />It seems as though Mr. Lucas is working towards the creation of a body of work that will stand the test of time like Dante's Inferno, Chaucer's Tales or Shakespeare's plays. If that is indeed the case, most of the people who will experience these movies will do so after they have been completed and all of us have come and gone our way. They will have the opportunity to experience the six episodes as one continuous, chronological adventure that acts as a parable for the importance of freedom, the need for constant vigilance in its defence, the evils of war, the destructive excess of greed, and the value friendship.<br /><br />As the collection continues to mature in the years to come, it will be interesting to see what changes continue to me made to bring a greater sense of cohesion to the Saga, inclusive of the incorporation of the newly announced episodes.
B001GF8WPI|4.0|One of my favorite movies.  Will Ferrell is a steller dramatic actor and everyone else is top notch. The whole thing is fantastic.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The Indiana Jones Franchise remains one of the most engrossing, thoroughly wholesome, wildly entertaining family experiences one can have at the movies. A crowning example of big budget Hollywood film-making at its best, this series justifies the unique hold American movies have on the world's imagination.<br /><br />There is never a moment in any of these movies where one waits to be entertained. Every sequence develops character and plot through catchy dialogue and/or great action sequences. The character and his adventures remain readily accessible to people of all cultures and the franchise represents one of the best examples of creatively brilliant, sheer entertainment.<br /><br />Messrs. Stephen Spielberg, George Lucas and their creative teams rightly merit all the accolades they have earned for this series of films and leading man Mr. Harrison Ford deserves special mention for his iconic portrayal worthy of America's great tradition of on screen heroes.<br /><br />This collection is an excellent addition to the living rooms of homes that look forward to family time in front the TV watching great movies together.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Good workout. Formatting is not ideal because you cannot move between options easily or skip intro. Music is not great.
B000G73UEU|5.0|I have listened to this CD often since I purchased it. It never fails to amaze me how great the music is, I love the variety of musicians, and am thrilled to have purchased the CD, now looking out for other CD's in the same genre.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book was very good. I enjoyed reading it, but the end was great, it's like I had gone thru those movies with Paul Newman and Robert Redford when you see that they have played you as they do to all in the movie...
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Helped me understand where my brother comes from. I can only hope he finds his \\"silver lining\\"
B00632HWOG|5.0|When all I want is a quick look - this app does the trick.  Nothing fancy - just the ability to check for messages while using my Kindle.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Too violent, no plot, no story to follow, no beauty, glamour of a bond film, just dark and violent and chase scenes.  Big disappointment
B004NELBPC|4.0|I check Huffington Post daily and find this app easy to navigate.  I used to be able to open the app and get the latest news, then read the stories while off-line in the car.  They changed the app and I can no longer read the stories off-line - I miss that feature.  If they would reinstate that feature I would give it 5 stars.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I bought this game because of the reviews everywhere, so I decided to give it a try even that Im not I JRPG fan this game has totally hooked me in, I can wait too see what's next each time I play it. GREAT !!!
B0095P29EG|5.0|this is a totally awsome picture, i mean it starts off with a huge hunk of a man needing clothes to put on. . .you must see this them go on to the next movie with him, hulk iron man . . .that will be my next one.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|Not as intuitive as the built-in alarm clock function on the Nexus 7, this product presents with a bit more of a learning curve.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This show is fabulous, I don't know why it was cancelled so early, I wish there were more episodes to watch.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Bought this for my daughter.  Larger and therefore a bit easier to loose.  Won't break or wear out like many products out there.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You product is very addicting and fun, but it should have cheaper items for sale I think you or temple run just copied each other.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|We rented this movie for family movie night...absolutely no regrets! Great movie...lots of fun. Plan to purchase it and keep it in the movie library!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great game to play, especially for children my 5 year old loves the game he plays it all the time it's worth playing
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|The SketchBook Pro drawing tool is easy to use. I am still becoming totally familiar with all the tools and techniques, however, I have quickly been able to produce a couple &#34;masterpieces&#34;.<br /><br />Very addictive. Looking forward to becoming more familiar and proficient.
034580404X|5.0|These were very exciting and stimulating books!  My husband and I both read the trilogy and really enjoyed them.  It makes us laugh when Anastasia keeps referring to her subconscious and her inner goddess.  There were some pretty steamy parts that kind of set my inner goddess on fire!  Great books!
B0045HCJQW|5.0|My daughter is in this play. We wathced it at home to see what the play was like before we audtitioned
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I didn't want to stop watching the episodes.  I watched 4 in one sitting.  Great program, some history and a look at how the other half lived.  Looking forward to Season 3.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|My wife and I got hooked on this series.  We have watched about 25 episodes in two weeks!  Yea, I know, get a life.  We really love the series.
B009KUANWG|5.0|So nice to have something new from Adele and this song did not disappoint.  Did not see the movie but when I saw her perform at the Oscars - I just had to have it!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Playing Solitaire may be my guilty secret.  Not sure what keeps me at it, but I find this app on my tablet positively addictive!  Just love to see the card dance when I win.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My friends were all raving about the return of Downton Abbey for a third season.  I had now seen any episodes, so I had to start at the beginning (season one was terrific too), and now am working my way through season two.  It is an interesting series that not only has lots of drama and humor, but also helps one understand the distinctive social structure of England at the beginning of the 20th century.  The adventures of lords and ladies, and the entire staff of of butlers, footmen, ladies maids, and all the others, is quite interesting to observe.  Season one opens on the day the Titanic sunk, and season two deals with World War !, and so one gets a good sense of history as well as.  Very entertaining and worthy of being part of Masterpiece Theater.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was a very sweet, sometimes funny, sometimes sad story with a bit of a twist, that grabbed me instantly.  I enjoyed it immensely.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|This cover has made the use of my Kindle much more satisfying as it enables the use of the Kindle more like a book<br />.very happy with it.
B00B2G2RG6|2.0|Why must you insult the viewers' intelleligence with new people in every episode who are secretly working for Carroll,the F.B.I.raid different places where suspects simply run out the back door and escape because there's no one manning the back and in this episode,Hardy allows the girl to simply walk up on him and push the stun device into his chest area.It was great seeing Kevin Bacon in a series that could have worked if not for all of the head games and childish tactical errors but even he can't save this level of work.All of the flashing back was becoming annoying and unneeded,it broke the tension in some places (ruining the mood).
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|This was a gift for my identical twin grand daughters. They immediately liked playing with this. Enjoy the different animals and various places to put them.
B001223BLU|5.0|A teenager growing up in the 60s can never forget the unique sound of this group.  Love, hurt and joy poured from each song.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Another great humanistic story from Clint....we thoroughly enjoyed the movie! Could have left out the opening scene where he's having a battle with his prostate!! Added nothing to the movie.
B0050KTR36|5.0|This is a great App, especially if you are premed and taking Anatomy.  This App was more indepth then I expected and it give me a fun way to memerize all of the names of the bone as well as where they are all located.  I also bought the othe speed apps to go with this one.  My only regret is that I didn't find these apps sooner.
B004LRNYJW|4.0|Good movie on many levels, and fairly true to the book and the original movie &#34;Let the Right One In&#34;.  I enjoyed the relationship between the two main characters and the bond they formed as &#34;misfits&#34;.  Some scenes were quite dark and disturbing, not for the faint of heart or young children.  Everyone remembers the child or two in middle school who didnt fit in and how miserable other students made their lives.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|Awesome flick.  Great rendition to Heat with more of a kick.  Affleck did great on all aspects. I highly recommend it.
B002QNTNL6|5.0|I had no idea what this was about and ended up loving it. A great family movie. Fun to watch.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Seemed too romanticized. Had some interesting insights. I think a  good playwright can make a good movie of it. It was a good read.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this is a great game. lol n I had to do this for a quest. so I am going to keep writing random words.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|We often have mixed motives for watching movies; they are important, they are classic, they are nominated. I give in to these reactions to my regret. I want first and foremost to be entertained. Skyfall is entertaining at the highest level. I must say that too much is paid to the quality of the picture and not enough to the sound. If you want to really enjoy this movie, upgrade your sound system. The best picture that doesn't draw you into the action is a loss. There are too many pure action/fantasy movies that lack what skyfall has, class and straightforward entertainment. I recommend it as a high point to the Bond Dynasty. Keep it up Daniel Craig, a true spy in the English image, not a fantasy.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|my girls saw this movie over and over even had geandma and grandpa come over to see it they loved it
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|There were too many gaps in the movie and one flaw. The scene with the drug overdose couldn't have had the plane fly over it. She was supposed to be in Orlando and wound up in Atlanta. It was entertaining. I didn't believe that he wouldn't have just said, &#34;I have no idea&#34; when asked about the bottles and let it go. He could have even said that he would not comment on a hero like the dead attendant. Anyone that bad would not have redeemed himself at that time, much as we would like to believe it.
B0051SDM5Q|4.0|The boss told me to read it, so I did.  It's not something that I would read on my own.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook in the Kindle fire tablet is great in a way that you can keep in touch with people but I cant customize my profile cover,and cant download the photos I like. If in other devices has that feature, why on this one doesnt? Hope it can get a great update.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|Fairly ok for a book at no charge. If you have nothing to kill your time with, than that's just it!
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|I'm buy the Extended Edition as I know peter jackson must have deleted about 1 hr of footage from this movie as always.... I love LOTR and Hobbit novels and would love to see all shot footage....so can wait :)
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|What. thought we were suppose to help the bids not the pigs. Snow I'm just confuse on who's the good or bad guy :/ ?!?
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this is one game I play a lot.  Trying to beat a previous time is challenging.  Some of them just won't let you get a better score.  Love it anyway.
B0001WDAX6|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie. It is an amazing story of someone who was about to be  suicidal and later realizes how important he has been to everyone he knows. Great movie. A true classic.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|I don't remember ordering this program.  Can it be removed from my Kindle?  Was this a free or pay program?
068987474X|5.0|When it comes to most areas of life we are for the  most part rational, but when it comes to relationships, his little kind gesture to us makes us feel he is in love with us, and the same holds true for men. Her little kind gesture does not mean she is in love. Great book for both sexes to read! Enjoy!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|One of my favorite applications.  Great discussion potential when you are at a restaurant and your server asks  you a question.
0307949508|5.0|The book came in great condition and I couldn't put this book down. This series is amazing. The story is very intense and riveting. Bought the book at a great price and it was worth it!!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Don't remember ordering this and don't know how to play it.  If possible, remove it.  Doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I love, love, love this movie! It's hilarious and witty. It's not meant to win any Oscars, but it's such a good time. I have seen it over 4 times and I still laugh hysterically. Found my new quoting movie!
B005HSL626|1.0|I don't remember ordering this program.  If it can be removed, please do so.  Doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I'm a little surprised this film got the best picture Oscar.  I really liked it and obviously the historic significance is compelling.  Certainly not going in my top-ten though.

B004KBSQBA|5.0|I used to have a tape of Graceland, and loved it then...so when I saw a tv interview with Paul Simon I was anxious to update to a CD so I could listen to it again.  I still have no idea what the words mean, but I love the rhythm;  it makes me happy to listen to it!
B007N8RULO|5.0|The game is fun and user friendly. I win more games on my Kindle than when I am using a mouse on our computer. I'm not sure why, but it makes me happy
B002C4YYEU|5.0|THIS MOVIE CAN TOUCH THE HEART AND IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF MY TOP MOVIES, I SAY RENT IT
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|This app is worthless. Don't waste your time it is board to navigate and fails most if the time! I love it on my computer but not on the kindle
B00597A4VY|5.0|Its an all around great flick and would make a great movie to have in anyones colection,,,awesome true story of great men and machine
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book made me look at wheat and wheat products in a completely new light. Definitely worth reading if you suspect you may have a problem with wheat.
B009329Y30|3.0|ITS OK I WOULD NOT SAY ITS A GOOD MOVIE, IT HAS ITS PLACE AND TIME BUT NOT A MUST SEE
B000F9RB8K|5.0|I love this movie from the first time I have seen it. I can watch it over and over again. The story is great and the scenery breathtaking. It will keep you interested till the end.

B000Q79HTC|5.0|I bought The Bourne Identity because I had just The Bourne Supremacy on DVD earlier in the day and I want to watch the first movie  before the second one.  I really started to get into the movie about the time Jason disappears from the operating table.  It's a really good movie and I give it five stars.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|STORY IS NOT MY FLAVOR AND IT DID NOT KEEP MY ATTENTION AT ALL, I WOULD NOT PUSH THIS ON ANYONE
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game except for the fact that the worlds are tiny compared to any other minecraft. Even the apple version of the pocket edition has bigger worlds. The game is alright but if you have a computer get it for that. The computer version is alot cooler and has twice as many fetures as the pocket edition.
B0060D08JO|5.0|THE MOVIE IS GREAT, LOVE THE FIGHT SCENES ARE AWESOME AND THE STORY LINE WORKS, ITS A MUST SEE FOR ALL
B005BZQVJ8|2.0|a co worker recommended it, I thought it was kinda dumb, if it wasnt for Justin Bateman, & the guys from SNL dont think it would have been as funny as it was..I mean, I love stupid humor movies a lot, but this isnt a fave of mine.
B00846TRHY|5.0|I HAS A GREAT STORY LINE AND i WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND THE MOVIE TO ANYONE,,,GRIPPING AND WARMS THE HEART LOL
B0058SNI9O|5.0|Great quality, but wrong size. I sent them back but no problems.<br />Ordered a different type of Croc's. That's all
B005CGI4EG|4.0|very funny series ,the quality is clear ,many extras to DVD's and  the price is definitely right and it was packaged very nicely
0790731452|5.0|Before I watched Mars Attacks it never occurred to someone might be able to make a movie this ridiculous and funny at the same time.  I don`t know all the terms the pros use for a movie like this....campy?, etc.  I don`t see how one could confine such a cinematic breakthrough into catagories or pigeon holes but maybe it is because words fall short of describing how really really good this production is.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I own the complete set the Harry Potter dvds and this is one of the best series I believe I have had in a long time some a must own dvd collection
B000QGEB12|5.0|One of the funniest movies I`ve seen in a long time, you`ll be watching this one over and over.  It rates up there with &#34;Mars Attacks&#34; in entertainment.  I would give you a synopsis but you really need to see this piece of cinema gold to appreciate it.  Thanks Stephen Chow!  You did a great job!
B007HJ9NBE|3.0|Not really overly excited about this, its kinda old, but still fun in a way. Just ok is my grade
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very good book ! Can not wait to see the movie. I could not put it down once I got into it.
B004R112GO|3.0|Didnt really get scared at all.  first one had me jumping out of my seat.. this one lacked something.  wasnt bad, just not as scary
B005LAJ16I|5.0|My husband and I loved the series. Am a huge fan of Mandy Patinkin. Cannot wait to see season 2.
B00715RI16|5.0|Wow much better than #2 and as scary if not scarier than #1.  good scares = good movie, definitely enjoyed it
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Season 2 was fantastic. Maggie Smith and the entire cast are wonderful. A refreshing change of pace from the sex, violence and language on most drama series.
B0054SMID0|3.0|If you have two hours to kill and nothing else to do or are a huge M.M. fan then this is for you.
B003TU1660|4.0|The side starp broke after only wearing them 10 times, but Teva replaced them and the new ones have been great. Not as comfotable as my old school Keens, but for some reason Keen does not make an open toe sandal for men anymore
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I got WOOL 1 free for the Kindle, and had no problem with wanting to pay for the omnibus edition. I thoroughly enjoyed the WOOL saga and will be looking into more of what Hugh HOwley  has written.

0061692034|4.0|Canada is a novel about loss and the unavoidable and sudden, sometimes devastating, turns in life. It tells the story of Dell Parsons, whose life is forever changed after his parents  rob a bank and are sent to jail for it, sending their family into a tailspin. His sister, Berner, runs away. Dell ends up in a forsaken town in Saskatchewan under the care of Arthur Remlinger, a troubled man with a dark past.<br /><br />The theme of Canada is loss and change. “Most things don't stay the way they are very long”, it doesn't matter if one is prepared or not, the world is constantly changing and will continue to change, forcing our sense of normalcy to perpetually evolve. Those who tolerate loss and can adapt to these shifts without stopping to dwell on what could have been will ultimately have a better chance in life.<br /><br />The book is narrated with a crisp, lean prose that moves forward at an unhurried pace, without ever becoming slow. I definitely recommend this novel, a great addition to the canon of American fiction.
B000I14UTS|4.0|It surprised me however.  I enjoyed it. Pretty good movie I enjoyed it. Pretty good movie I enjoyed it. Pretty good movie I enjoyed it.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|We were hooked on SOA from the start, couldn't watch just one episode at a time.  Can't wait for them to stream Season 5!!!
B00633W614|4.0|Excellent sequel, but not quite as good as the first book.There were a few rather tedious episodes meaning the excitement to keep reading dwindled a bit.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent casting. The characters were real and we enjoyed watching the entire series On Amazon prime video.  Good intrigue and character development.  It kept our interest the entire three seasons.
B007704HO6|5.0|I read this book aloud to my wife in bed for three nights running - and we were both in raptures about it -  even the odd tear!  We have recommended it to our children - and they all love it.  Long live James Bowen!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|A great suspenseful thriller. Well done from factual material. We enjoyed watching it before the awards were given. Well-deserved of first place picture.
0741470314|5.0|As someone who enjoys the King of pop's music very much, I can guarantee that this book was defiantly worth the read.
B005PK553C|3.0|It is well acted and good for people who enjoy this genre, not my favorite.  I believe it received some emmy nominations.
B00AY0A71I|1.0|I was only able to watch about 20 minutes of the movie before the sound started getting funky and then the movie cut out altogether.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Deserving of all of the awards that it has received.  Want to watch it again, might even consider buying the Blue-Ray.
B008JFUUQ2|3.0|It has some good jokes and somewhat memorable moments, but it's pretty by-the-numbers. I doubt it'll be remembered a few years from now. I know I won't remember it.
0786956291|5.0|My teenage sons love this game. There 13 and 17<br />Takes awhile to play and get thought but that stops them baiting each other.<br />They are getting better at the rules and how to play properly all the time.<br />Keeps them amused for hours

You can easily play it nonstop from start to finish!
B0041KBWM0|2.0|I like period pieces and Jane Austen, but Emma leaves me cold. Maybe it's the portrayal by the actress...hard to imagine any of her friends liking her very much.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|you can't go wrong with this free game. I have it on both my phone and kindle.  No problems with the download.
B006TLFIAQ|2.0|It just. Didn't have a food flow to it.  It wasn't a complete waste of time but close.  Not well written or directed and the acting was only so,so.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great series... although sometimes a bit too tragic for one family to bear.  It will be difficult to wait until the fourth season starts!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We have watched every episode and we love this show. Almost caught up and will then only be able to watch new episodes as they are available :-(

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's fun it gets you excited and then you crush an your like carp I shouldn't of went that way
B00846F1YW|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed this very much!  The hidden objects were not only like &#34;usual&#34; but also sometimes had to find &#34;in the dark&#34; with finger being the flashlight.  Interesting & fun!<br />I usually don't care about the &#34;story&#34;, however, this was actually interesting and entertaining.  The characters were unique and funny and kept my interest between chapters.  Highly recommend!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Enjoyable, well done, but will never be considered a classic.  I'm happy for Ben, though.  Good to learn a little history, also.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun and interactive game. Easy to understand quests and my 7 year old loves it. Always different chores to do so its not boring.
B009D3CTVS|5.0|Bought this to link my V-drums with my studio computer (Superior Drummer in Logic) and it works perfectly. No issues at all.
0345803485|2.0|I would rate this book as pornographic. I did not like it at all and found the sex scenes very offensive
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Although a very captivating book, it was a little predictable. It seemed to drag a little in the middle and there was too much provocative stuff that took away from the story instead of adding to it.
B004CHURKA|4.0|Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler is the Babe Ruth of Wagner conductors - he is generally considered by most to be the greatest interpreter of Wagner's work within the era of recorded sound, with some extending that title to include the entire Austro-Germanic repertoire of Beethoven, Brahms, etc.  Even those that disagree have to admit that his influence is massive, with conductors either seeking to continue his tradition (Barenboim) or react against it (Boulez) to this day.<br /><br />Which makes it all the more of a pity that we never got a great recorded Ring Cycle from him.<br /><br />There were plans to do a studio Ring in good mono sound in the 1950s, but Furtw&auml;ngler died after completing \\"Die Walk&uuml;re\\" for EMI, and it fell to Decca and Georg Solti to make the first studio Ring in the following decade.  Oh well, at least we have two Rings, both made in the early Fifties to get some kind of idea of Furtw&auml;ngler's craft.  The first is an abysmally recorded Ring performed in Milan in 1950 with cuts to the score - you should only get this if you are a completest or if you are a big Kirsten Flagstad fan.  Then there is the Ring being reviewed here, which is a performance for Italian radio recorded over many weeks in 1953 with Furtw&auml;ngler leading the RAI Symphony Orchestra.<br /><br />The sound is better than the La Scala Ring, although it's still a recording for radio made in Italy in the 1950s, so you're not going to get the modern stereo experience.  The sound actually improves as the Cycle goes on - \\"Rheingold\\" is pretty dim but by the time you get to \\"G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung\\" the sound has actually gotten pretty decent... you can actually start hearing some of the detail in the orchestra, for example.<br /><br />Performance-wise it's a mixed bag.  Most of the singers are very good - Martha M&ouml;dl is a good Br&uuml;nnhilde even if she isn't the greatest to take on the role, Ferdinand Frantz is a perfectly adequate Wotan, Wolfgang Wingassen does a good job with both roles he's given (Loge and Siegmund) and Ludwig Suthaus makes for a good if not spectacular Siegfried.  The conducting is of course masterful - Furtw&auml;ngler brings out both the beauty and drama in the score and is supreme in his handling the flow of the whole thing... the tempi feel neither rushed nor bogged down and the tendency to be \\"episodic\\", which can creep into some others' performances of this piece never occurs here.  The main problem with this performance though is the orchestra the conductor is working with - at least in the first half.  It really shows that this is the first Ring Cycle the RAI Orchestra has ever played.  The beginning of this cycle is pretty rough - at the end of \\"Rheingold\\" for instance you will picture Clint Eastwood as Wotan in your mind when the horns bleat like they're in some Spaghetti Western (I am not the first to make this observation).  But the great thing about Furtw&auml;ngler is that he was able to transform the RAI players into a listenable ensemble over the course of the project... by the time \\"G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung\\" rolls around they actually sound like a real orchestra (although you still won't mistake them for the Vienna Phil) and this coupled with improved recorded sound actually makes for an unreservedly enjoyable listening experience.<br /><br />This boxset is a reissue of the 1990 EMI set, and uses the same remastering.  All of the CDs come in cardboard sleeves which are put into one fold-open box (as opposed to the earlier set which used jewel cases).  The main advantage of this set over the earlier set though is the bonus CD-ROM with synopses and libretti.  This is a really cool addition, because the libretti included is the COMPLETE Salter-Mann translation.  This is the translation that is used in the CD booklets for the Solti and Karajan Rings, but there most of the stage directions have been cut out for the first three operas... but this CD-ROM includes the stage directions as well, soyou actually know what is going on.  For those of you like me who like the Salter-Mann this will be a godsend.  And the best thing is that the format is that it is versatile - you can either read it on a computer screen or print it out so you can read it on large sheets of paper... much better than trying to read along in teeny-tiny CD booklets!<br /><br />To top it all off this set from EMI is decently priced.  There are some companies and individuals that have attempted to remaster this Ring with the latest sound technology.  The results are not *that* impressive (you will only be able to pull so much fidelity from the original recording) especially for the prices that they charge.  One website is charging over 100 *euros* for a complete download of this Ring... for less than half of that you can get decent if not great sound quality AND a handy-dandy CD-ROM libretto.  If you have never experienced Wagner's Ring before get either the Solti or Janowski sets on CD (they are in much better sound and will be a better first time listen) or either the Levine or Boulez sets on DVD (opera is also a *visual* experience after all although there are deficiencies in both of these video Rings, so be wary).  This set though is a great addition to the library of someone who has experienced Wagner's magnum opus a few times and wants to see what all the hoopla over Furtw&auml;ngler is about... just be aware that after you listen to this you may start having fantasies of a studio Ring with him leading a world class orchestra in pristine stereo sound.  You will then have to accept this dream as unobtainable and move on with life - as all lovers of the Ring have to do at some point in their lives.  It's okay though because we will be here for you.

B000FCKC4C|4.0|Love it very good book and I really recommend it to many and all people who can get it! Read and enjoy
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This is one of the funniest children's animated movies!  Great humor for kids and adults. We also liked that we were able to buy the digital copy before it came out on DVD/Blu-ray.  Awesome!  I would recommend this movie to everyone!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The best show ever made! The scenary, acting and writing are all excellent. Each season gets better than the one before.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|But I think what the writer did to the audience in season three could've been done differently.  Especially the last episode.  It was too shocking.  If you've not watched the last one, I encourage you to do so.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|It's a good book and well written, but it's a copy of Matched by Ally Condie. I would recommend this for a fan of dystopian romance novels.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is an outstanding show. It was great to catch up on season 3 by purchasing the missed episodes. Thanks Amazon!
B000068G5F|5.0|Absolutely gorgeous cover art. There are some skippable tracks, but no RHCP album is flawless in that manor. Despite that, this is still my favorite RHCP record. Frusciante at his best both vocally and instrumental-wise. Super stoked to have this on vinyl in the collection!
B000089RV6|5.0|I have bought this CD at least 5 times it is great and always seems to find a new home. I have all of the music from these guys old and new. For Those About to Rock is my favorite Black Ice is third.
B00005AQF6|5.0|I've been a fan of Doggystyle for over two decades, and hearing it on vinyl magnified all of the reason i loved it as a kid growing up. The fat Moogerfooger basslines, the P-Funk samples, and Snoop's early 90's style west coast flow. One of those records you can put on and never have to get up to skip a track. Sounds amazing.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Or is it? It was pretty well done but lengthy and lagged at times. Characters played well by the actors it would be nice if it is extended and modernized a bit.
B00065U09A|5.0|I bought this album for &#34;Sphere&#34;, &#34;The Afterglow&#34;, and &#34;Surrogate People&#34; and they did not disappoint whatsover. Very warm and ballsy sounding on vinyl. Even became a fan of the piano ballad &#34;My Life&#34;. Frusciante records are only going to keep increasing in value, may as well grab this record before it's $50.<br /><br />Wish there was a pressing of To Record Only Water For Ten Days. That is the crowning jewel in Frusciante's catalog.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|love the game just wish it wasnt so hard to get other horses and gems. great kids game they can have a horses without the mess

B000FC1MCS|4.0|This book is an insightful glimpse into the world of an autistic teenager, with a great talent for mathematics.  i wonder<br />how the author did his research? Was some of it first hand?  This book falls into the same general category as<br />&#34;Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.&#34;  In both stories, you have children who are obviously autistic, but beyond that<br />similarity they could not possibly be more different from each other, each having their own unique challenges to deal with.<br />These stories are essential if the general public will ever develop any kind of sensitivity or understanding about autism, and<br />how it affects the lives that are touched by it
B0099G7KDQ|3.0|Like their work, but this is not their best. Surprised that it won the award. I'll keep listening, maybe it will grow on me.
0547569653|5.0|Highly recommend to athletes or those looking to jump start their fitness. Scott's an incredible example of what mental toughness can help us achieve.
B008ODZNLG|4.0|We enjoyed this documentary- at times it was incredibly interesting with all the details about the lives of this family of sushi chefs, or 'shokunin' (I guess that's like 'master craftsmen'?) as Jiro, the 85 yr old protagonist tells the camera.  It was also poignant and revealing without any of the sort of voyeuristic crap that sometimes seems to creep into documentaries about individuals.<br /><br />We found that during the first half, we were completely wrapped up in what seemed an oppressive system- can / would *anyone* in our society willingly sign up for a career that would be essentially the same set of tasks performed repeatedly each day...for 75 years?  I mean, we've read about the apprentice to the Japanese sword maker that polishes swords for 20 years before being allowed to touch any other part of the process- but it all seemed like a fable or story from a long-ago history...  And for some reason, the thought of having to apprentice for 10 or more years before you are allowed to do anything but massage dead octopus in freezing water, and then clean dishes- well, it seemed both amazing and a touch crazy.<br /><br />After that first half, the attention shifts to his apprentices and sons and their daily life- and for us this softened the story of their lives and their work, allowing us a tiny glimpse of how this way of seeing and thinking works in actual practice. Some of the earlier comments are worked backed into the flow in late in the movie- and they seemed transformed from ones of obsession to something approaching logic, beauty, and joy.  Sprinkled on top like sesame seeds on a Cali Roll are some ominous comments about the impact of the popularity of sushi on both the quality of the cuisine and the availability of the staple fish...<br /><br />Overall it's a great way to learn as well as gaining a new perspective.

B0094K1JPC|5.0|This was a great movie with just the right amount of humor.  Everyone in it did a fantastic job and Harrison Ford was just the right person for the role he played.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|Dont even remember this so it was not good I would guess.  Other wise wouldnt I have remembered it? :(
B006VGGAC4|2.0|Don't waste your time or money. You will know more than what you need to know abut his affair with the housekeeper (which you probably got free from TV already). I did, however, lesrn about the bodybuilding world and its beginnings in the United States.  Arnold left me with the impression that he longed for recognition all of his life and that is another reason why he wrote this book. I noted that his grammar was meticulous which probably means that he got a good editor. ( because of the language barrier).
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Works fine. What can I say. This has been around for a long time and was a new download to replace the app that I had on previous hardware.
B009VB97EY|1.0|No plot, awful movie. Except for the bump and grind , which is all it was, it stunk! I feel bad for Mathew Mc Conahay, I'm sure I spelled his name wrong...
B002C4YYEU|5.0|The visual effects of this movie were awesome has a great storyline. And is just fun to watch every now and then
B008476HBM|5.0|Absolutely incredible. This creative love story shows the trials and triumphs or a man and a woman destined to be together.
B003498SDA|5.0|One of the first All Night Digitally shot movies in hollywood history, great story line, fine acting, worth watching over every now and then. Jamie and Tom are great together.
B0030MM68O|1.0|This movie was very grainy & slow to load. I couldn't even watch it,<br />kept buffering and would paly & freeze.
B00008L3U1|5.0|Another one of my favorite childhood movies. Had to buy it, wish they could transfer these to bluray I would buy it again.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Good film, good acting and a good story line. It will keep your attention from beginning to end. Mark Wahlberg makes the movie work, he plays this role well and is very believable.
B000Q67876|5.0|Love this movie. It shows on A&E all the time but wanted my own copy regardless. A must have for people who appreciate good dialogue.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I am so glad their is a good AntiVirus that is free. I help to stay worry free. I have had a paid version of AVG on my PC but is nice to have this free edition for so many other things like Cell phone, laptops and my Christmas present Kindle.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|Angie has always been B A, and in this movie nothing is different. Fast pace action keeps you entertained and before you know it's over, sequel please.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I watched this movie but within the first 5 minutes I was drawn in. From the introduction to Pi's name to the very end. The visuals were stunning and the story was even better. Right after I watched it I wanted to watch it again. I took a risk in purchasing this film before I had seen it but I'm glad I did.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Still fun here but not as good as some. Has some fun ones though not overly difficult. Worth playing anyways.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great book :) It was  very intriguing. I felt like every time I started reading I didn't want to stop I had to know what would happen next. I'm curious to see how the movies turn out!
B004SIP6QI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie a lot. I originally viewed it when it came out and knew I wanted it in my collection. The cast was great to,
B004OCCKX0|3.0|This is a very nice collection of the groups music but the sound has a vanilla quality lacking in distinction.  I can't compare it to the LP but I suspect that the LP would sound better.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some of the games are tough but it really challenges you. Excellent game for long trips or even just to kill time.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Been waiting a long time. Worth it. Good characters, interesting plots. The old professor makes the show.  Worth the time.
0977326403|5.0|Mr. Collin's Social Sector / Non-profit Monograph to Accompany Good to Great is an excellent tool for non-profits to use to improve their practices. I studied this book in a non-profit class in college - and I continue to reference to it & Good-to-Great in my current non-profit church role.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Safe Haven is a good book to read but nothing special.  It's okay just as the rating suggests.  All the hype over the movie makes you think it's better than it really is.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game! I would highly recommend it for all ages. Collect prizes and puzzle pieces to have more fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season Three certainly didn't disappoint me - except I'm SO SAD that we lost Matthew!!!  Can't we bring him back??
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We first learned this game in 2007 with a friend. We later purchased our own sets, acquiring the basic Settlers, Seafarers, and Cities and Knights with all the 5-6 player expansion sets. It is expensive when you buy all those components, but we usually play with two other couples. With all the little parts on the table, it is difficult to keep things where they are supposed to be, so we bought a clear sheet of stiff plastic (acrylic) to cover the basic setup, including the harbors and numbered disks, which helps a lot.<br /><br />My main complaint is that the hexes in the set we used when learning the game were about twice as thick as those now included. That makes the current versions seem pretty flimsy for the money spent. The interlocking border helps, but it is still hard to get everything to stay where you put it until everything is in place and you can get the plastic sheet situated.<br /><br />We have friends who love the game - almost addicted - and others who don't care for it at all, so I would say that it isn't for everyone. Perhaps the biggest plus for the game is the flexibility, By repositioning game pieces or starting in different places, you can have an almost endless variety of games.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I haven't spent much time using this app yet, but everything  I've done with it so far has been great. The numbers are really large, a big plus!
B002CMQS1O|5.0|For me this movie is one of the funniest movies that I have seen even to this day. It is an awesome mockumentary and at times I almost believed this was a real band.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This is a really good film, but just a bit hard to understand all of the various accents without subtitles available.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|I didn't expect  this movie to be sooo good. The ending of of this movie blew me away. I can't write anymore about this movie because I might give away the ending.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It was great!  We have seen it at least 12 times and we enjoy it every time.  It is funny and the music/singing is amazing!
B0098VYKSA|3.0|There is a bit in the middle of the movie that is just too much, and just kind of drags out the story.  Still, a great movie to watch on your fancy HD TV.  Probably too much for little kids though...
B000QRIGLC|4.0|The authors added the entire story of Mr. Luttrell's becoming a Seal which was interesting, but I kept wanting to skip ahead to the story illustrated by the book's title. The story finally did not disappoint. I was amazed at how much damage the human body could maintain and still perform under the conditions of warfare. It's a good read once the actual story begins.
B005LAII0S|5.0|This DVD is in very good condition I would recommend it to anybody very good product my kids loved it.
B009K86D86|5.0|This is a must-watch for any American citizen. The control the corporate big cats have over our meat is astonishing. I considered going vegetarian after watching this, but then I decided to just make sure the chicken I eat is open range chicken and that the beef I eat is from a grass-fed cow. There is a huge movement toward this, but more people need to be aware of the corruption in these processing plants.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|The DVD is in very good condition the comparison between any other is very good the quality for this DVD is perfect.
072325804X|5.0|I actually wanted the one originally pictured, but after three tries calling Amazon for a replacement, they kept sending me the one with a more simple cover. I finally found the other cover from a seller, but it came damaged and after comparing the two, I actually liked the simple cover more. Why? The inside of the the one now pictured has a map inside which does not exist in the one with the more lively cover. The artwork inside is by Beatrix Potter and very nice. I really enjoy the hardback edition to my Beatrix Potter collection.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|Very good<br />The sound and picture for this DVD is fantastic very good quality I would recommend this DVD to many more people.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|But once the crash occurred, to me it was pretty predictable. The only question was which way would he go...would he hide his secret, lie, and get away without being punished, or own up to it and get the help he needed. The rest, in between, was predictable.
B007MDB548|5.0|Very good product I would recommend it to people the quality is very good my kids loved it I did too
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I never considered myself a big fan of postapocalyptic VaultTech style books, and i was really surprised when I found myself completing the first third of the book without even understanding it. Anyway i was totally glued to the story line and charecters, and all those funny parts about the IT guys.<br />Book is very well written and i'm looking forward to read other parts of the saga.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This is a  good movie well worth seeing. All the actors are wonderful so I will keep this one on my shelf.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|character development is great in this show.  I am very glad that I found it on Amazon.  I will finish with season one and look forward to the next several seasons.  I am pretty picky about the shows I watch on TV as my time is important and I do not want to waste it watching the usual dribble..  This show is a cut above and worth an hour here and there.
0321714113|5.0|This is a very good premier for someone who needs to refresh the programming concepts required to develop C++ code.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I very much like this product. It's convenient and easy to navigate. The only issue I have is that there is no search button on my Kindle. I have to pick from a drop down menu to make the search work. And I wouldn't mind seeing a way to sort the videos by date or views or something like that. Otherwise, I like it a lot. Thanks a lot.
B00B3EVNEE|5.0|Another triumph for this sadly underrated legend. If all you know of Robin Trower is Bridge of Sighs, you're missing out on alot of fantastic music. Trower takes some older classic music and breathes new life into it. He then adds in some new music of his own and makes it flow seamlessly. The trademark guitar sound is there, and combined with his growing confidence in his own vocals we're seeing an artist at the top of his powers 40 plus years on in his career. Suffice it to say, if you are, at all, a fan of the guitar, pick up this album.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Interesting twist on the assassination.  Fair reading but a bit too long and drawn out.  This is the first S. King novel I have read.
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|I could never figure out what this movie was all about. I understood the story, but not the stage and why it was used to tell the story.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Enjoyed this book.  It was interesting from start to finish.  It explained a few things that have always interested me.  Would recommend to average reader.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is a great show and the dvd is a must have if you are a fan of the show
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The book was a good read and interesting perspective - it started out strong but finished on the weak side,  Got me interested in further studying NDE.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|This is a great show and the dvd is a must have if you are a fan of the show
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This does not happen often to me but after having read about 12% of the Kindle book I could not stand it anymore. I returned it. I have to agree with other opinions, juvenile writing. No substance. Sorry I wasted my, albeit little, time. I would have given it 0 stars if possible.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This is the best series in the world!!! I love the characters. Perfect amount of details. GREAT ENDING!!!!!!!! Love what happened with all the characters in the end!!!!!! HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!! 100+ stars!!!!!!!! :D
B00A0L7PE8|3.0|... the SINGLE is good. On endless loop it can go on your nerves, as any SINGLE. For that price I thought it would be his new CD. Ma'bad. ...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Pretty good app for the kids. They haven't had trouble navigating and it seems to be fun for them. Yada yada
B008CP6RWU|1.0|Not good game. Just views and not fun at all. I dont recommed. dont buy it. not worth it. pm
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This was a great purchase for me, I can now fall right asleep and sleep with ease. I normally wake up several times during the night. I love the waves sound especially.
0307730697|5.0|This book gave me the inspiration and motivation to do my best as a current Army ROTC Cadet. Honestly, even the best review can't do this book justice. Just read it, and you'll understand why hundreds of us have become so inspired, touched, and humbled by a book that reveals so much about the strength of a man's character and fortitude.
B000P0J09W|5.0|love it great movie  thank for fast shipping on it i tell other about your place thank you so much love 80s stuff the new stuff is not as good as the 80s stuff
B0095P3ULC|4.0|The special effects on this movie were outstanding and the imagery was exceptional. They were so good, in fact, that they covered for the complete lack of writing. It almost seemed as if this movie was created as a series of 30 second bits intended solely to make good commercials.
1616550414|5.0|A wonderful book! Exactly what I expected! A truly great buy, I recommend this book to all The Legend of Zelda fans!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved watching Downton Abbey.  Great series - always keeps you guessing what will happen next!  Hope the 3rd season will soon be available on streaming!
B0045H6V8Y|3.0|While I liked this historical novel, it was difficult hearing good and understandable audio.  Perhaps this was due to analog to digital recording.
