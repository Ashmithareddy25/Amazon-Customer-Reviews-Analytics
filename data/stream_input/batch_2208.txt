B007QXWV1U|1.0|Can't open the app at all says closing  before you can even look / surf. Not even sure if I can get a refund on my kindle
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good and entertaining and it would have been BETTER with out the bad language. Learned a little history along the way also.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Purchased album before release date and the item was exactly as described. I was able to receive album on the date of release
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series has kept me on the edge of my seat!  Great balance in the story line between the servants & the Estate owners.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I now own all three seasons and am sure I will watch Season 3 at least once more before Season 4 premiers.  I can't wait!
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a great movie for both book lovers who have read the book and people who haven't. Jennifer Lawrence is an excellent actress and does justice to the main character. I have a kindle fire (not the HD version) and this looks great on it.
B0007G89G4|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favorites.  Growing up I loved it, and I still love it now.  I use(d) it for my students in a classroom to show them the various ways of writing beginnings....and how it doesn't have to be boring.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|A very well done app. Its very easy to get around, very intuitive. Its also very easy to cheat but the helps that are there are easy to control.
B000I0QL82|4.0|I have always loved this classic as well as it's counterpart White Christmas.  I cannot decide which version I like best!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is an awesome buy! You got all three of the films and some extra things as well. The Blu Ray's were in excellent condition!
B00005JKGK|3.0|It went along with the book.  Both were boring and both were supposed to help me understand international students better.  Yeah, not so  much.
B001EN71CW|4.0|But what can you excpect from a sci-fi series on Fox?  They have the biggest problems with supporting anything that isn't &#34;mainstream&#34;.
B007SPPANM|4.0|This is definitely a movie worth owning.  Each time I watch it I notice something that I did not catch before.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I read all kinds of books and probably read at least 5 books a month and this is the worst book I have read in a long time. The book is boring and brings up important issues that are NOT explored. Please don't waste your time reading this. I bought it for my kindle because I saw it had good ratings, but I have no clue how people gave this book positive feedback.
0143038095|3.0|Not a book I would have EVER chosen on  my own.  I had a job in which I worked with international students and this book was supposed to help me with understanding them.  Yeah.....I didn't enjoy the book.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The 3D on this movie is fantastic, now i know why everyone says it's the best movie &#34;out there&#34; for 3 D.  It's a good movie without it, but with a good Blu Ray and 3D tv...it just pops.
B00AATV046|5.0|This classic delivers a message that should be heard by many several times a year, not just at Christmas.  It describes perfectly what our society is missing and how greed and self-satisfaction have won out.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|Couldn't put it down! The book is honest and shocking.  Truth really is stranger than fiction, and it was a delight to read her truth.
0316044695|5.0|This book is fantastic.  Marcus Luttrell is amazing and the stuff he had to endure....I couldn't put this book down and even purchased a second copy to send to my son while he was in BT so that he could read it too.  Amazing.

B008O9V4C2|5.0|Always thought Steely Dan was highly forgotten in the music world.  Seriously, Bon Jovi or Bono better then them!!! NOT. Love &#34;Not the same without you&#34;.  He always surprises with his tunes.  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE

0783225881|5.0|&#34;If you build it, they will come.&#34;  This is one of the best movies ever and I love when my students are quiet enough to hear the voice at the beginning.....it is yet another way to show that your beginning doesn't have to be boring.
B00999DFP0|5.0|This is a great show and I cant wait for Season 6. The box set is well worth it and quality is perfect
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book takes its reader through a big part of our global history, in a way that makes you smile, if not cry from laughter. It is written with such a good humor, and even though the story seems to be very well built, the reader does not notice the effort from the author. It really was a huge pleasure for me reading through history at the same time as enjoying the old men's lifes!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|What a fantastic series!!!  Can't wait for season 4 to air.  My whole family loves Downton Abbey.<br />Great actors.  Violet is a gem.
B00005LC4Z|5.0|Another great movie and one of my favorites.  As a HS English teacher, this movie is great to show the various ways that one can write....the beginning doesn't have to be boring.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I bought it for my Kidle Fire HD because my other one got broke.<br />fast service and it works on my Kindle key board too.
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|Savages is a really bad ass movie. It is a must see. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing the whole time.
0670827592|5.0|I'm so glad that I bought the hardcover of this book. It brings back memories of when I read this as a little girl and the book has aged pretty well.
0679746323|3.0|This book gives a LOT of insight into Chairman Mao.  Much of what you learn in China and much of what the Chinese learn is not in this book.  This book is from his personal doctor and is banned in China....if that tells you anything.  The Chinese government doesn't want their people to know how Chairman Mao really was.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All three were very well written and I could not put them down. Now I don't know what to do! What will I read? The best trilogy!
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Not only for runners but for anyone who wants to learn about the human condition, loved it , thanks for the book.
1616550414|5.0|I got this from the Reddit Secret Santa exchange and I screamed like a little girl. All of the pages are beautifully designed and have a ton of awesome information in it. It even includes an awesomely illustrated manga in the back!
B009J2VQSK|5.0|A soulful but joyous collection of fine old and new performers, the kind of tunes one can't get out of mind!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|When I've first read Fifty Shades of Grey, I couldn't put the book down. The same thing is happening to the second one! The plot is terrible but it's oh so addicting! One thing for sure, E.L. James knows how to make you come back for more
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As usual, I was spellbound reading John Grisham. I believe I have read every book he has written.Love his books.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I noticed a lot of people rating it a 1 because of playing or loading issues. I didn't have any issues downloading or playing it. It is loads of fun, and being a huge Jurassic Park fan, I am super happy they came out with this game. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys TM games!
B0088D3PYE|2.0|Zafon is a marvellous writer and I loved the first two books in this series but this was a fearful letdown. Although beautifully written it contains no real story and simply rehashes parts of the others. Really just a short teaser for the next in the series, this will rightfully vanish into obscurity once the fourth is realeased. I can only hope the next is a real novel, with real narrative drive and an actual story, and not more bland, written 'Muzak' like this. Don't bother.
B00AF6B22E|2.0|The only thing I am glad about is that I did not spend $100 taking my wife to this movie as I wanted to go but did not have the time; will never watch again; slow and borrowing.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Who doesn't use Facebook. An absolute must need app on kindle. This app works just fine no issues with it.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This series is the all time best series for Greek mythology.  In this exciting book Kronos and his army are planning to destroy camp and Percy, Annabeth, Tyson, and Grover have to stop him.  They have to go into a secret maze called the Labyrinth.  There is very weird things in the maze.  Grover is still searching for pan and thinks he is in the maze.

B0057ZSPD2|5.0|Love the price I got it at! You should get it to if you like them in all! : )
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love it. A great way to end the Hunger Games Trilogy. Suzanne Collins is over good in her choice of words.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Don't let the start of this book turn you away. Keep reading it gets better. This author is very good with her wording and makes this smooth reading. I will say, one chapter will be talking her past than next chapter is her present and it keeps alternating between the Times. But it's easy to follow. I LOVED THIS  bOOK. I would love to see this as a movie.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great game lots of cool dinosaurs and this game is very addictive must have for any dino fan easy controls
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I read this book followed by Chris Kyle's book and now I'm readying Luttrell's second book and it is like I'm reading a longer saga.  They talk about each other in their books so if I'm going to give advice I would read them in the order I have (which happened by chance).  I was surprised how well written it was and how emotional I felt about his experiences.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I looooove using this app. It is so simple and the large buttons make it easy to use. Thumbs up for this =)

0374214913|5.0|I really loved \\"Mr. Panumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore\\" - a mystery yarn with loopy characters, 500 year old codexes to solve, and lots of technical wizardry thrown in.  The writing is crisp and inventive.  I look forward to Sloan's next book.
B009K0P10K|5.0|excellent service and tv shows! I'm so glad amazon has this instant video offer I couldn't be more pleased! Excellent!!!!!!!!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I didn't really like this app. You can search videos and watch them. I like to read comments etc. I couldn't do that.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|I had a hard time finishing this one. It just didn't have the intimacy of the earlier Pendergast novels. Sub-plots abounded for little reason other than to fill the pages. I won't give up on these authors but I hope this isn't a trend.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|This is my daughters favorite movie - but it has a wide enough appeal hat my 8 year old son doesn't complain too wildly about watching it over and over (well, to be honest he usually starts complaining a little on the 3rd time in a row!). Still some stereotypical Disney gender issues - but not over the top and humorous enough that everyone can enjoy it
0316286850|5.0|this book is just as good as my makeup secrets book.. I love them they are just so Awesome for learners of makeup

0765325950|5.0|A spectacular ending to the series. Tho the writing style of Brandon Sanders is different than Robert Jordan. He is able to portray Jordan's ideas in harmony and with style. And Amazon.com is allways dependable for quality and service.
B0011ZVPK2|5.0|I'm old enough to remember when this album came out. I was in college and it was still rare to hear live performances of your favorite bands unless you saw them in concert. I remember playing this album over and over and having friends crowd into our dorm room for an Eagles concert!<br /><br />Great versions of their greatest hits from a span of several years from the mid-70s to the early 80s. You will not be disappointed.
B006YC74E8|2.0|It  not &#34;photo wonder&#34; it was not the app I wanted. Not a lot you can do to you photos with this app.
030758836X|4.0|I liked this one. There was a spot in the middle where I hated the main character so  much, I wanted to walk away. Yet, that's when I realized just how great the book was--evoking a response out of me like that. And, the one thing so many have griped about, all these ridiculous one star reviews, is the ending. Whatever. There couldn't have been a better ending for these morons. The ending fit THEM. It wouldn't fit me, it wouldn't fit you, but it fit THEM so everyone needs to be quiet and then re-read if you didn't see how perfect the ending was for THEM. Brilliance, the whole thing. My only knock down of a star is that I didn't think it had to be so vulgar to be one of the best plots I've ever come across. But I'm a prude, so take my disdain with a grain of salt.

B00AKKTDJY|5.0|It's very entertaining and a fun little game. A game like this helps to pass the time a little if you waiting on something/someone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The acting is remarkable, subtle and engaging.  I just wish the writers would find a better way for actors to bow out of a story.

B005XDHNF4|4.0|I bought this to use on top of my wedding cake but I could not get ahold of them in time. I use it as a decoration piece at my house now. It is very cute and I like it that you can adapt to your liking. You can choose, for exemple, the color of the bride's hair and the color of the flowers she's holding. The only thing I didn't like about the bride is that she doesn't have legs; her dress is just one big block that you connect to the &#34;floor&#34;.<br />The groom is perfect and the hat and glass he holds are amazing.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Was intense and realistic.  Good acting as well.
0670023329|5.0|This book is an excellent look into the darkness of North Korea. It is at complete variance of what you see in the news. Shame on world leaders who just seem to worry more about &#34;climate change&#34; than these &#34;Nazi&#34; type camps!

B0087DIEGE|5.0|Buy This!!!! This an excellent product.  I don't know why Olympus didn't include this with the camera.  Once you put it on you don't need to take it off.  This is one of those instances when I will recommend that you buy the makers brand as oppose to the generic/aftermarket attachment due to it's build and quality.  This product works great.  I love to watch it open when you turn the camera on.  Wow!!!<br />Olympus why didn't you include this with the camera?...Why????
B00B0NDF26|4.0|I enjoyed this album, having really enjoyed Tegan and Sara's early releases, and being unimpressed with the last couple of albums. This one is more like the T&S I remember from previous albums
B005LAIH2C|3.0|Leather. Gore. Anachronistic steampunk weapons. Snarling witches. And a pair of classic fairy-tale characters who have become witch-hunting bounty hunters.<br /><br />If that doesn't tip you off that this isn't a very serious movie, then maybe the title will: \\"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters.\\" Tommy Wirkola's first big Hollywood movie is strictly the kind of action-packed popcorn-for-the-brain that is fun to watch, as long as you don't take it too seriously. The biggest problem is that the movie never quite figures out if it's a tongue-in-cheek action movie or a dark comedy.<br /><br />Once upon a time, Hansel and Gretel were abandoned in the woods by their parents, and ended up wandering over to a house made of candy. You know how the story goes -- there's a witch inside, she wants to eat Hansel, Gretel saves the day, and the witch is burned alive.<br /><br />Happily ever after? Well, not exactly. Fifteen years later, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are leather-clad weapon-toting bounty hunters who specialize in witches, especially since spells don't affect them. The mayor of a small town hires them when children go missing, despite the meddling of the psychotic local sheriff and his band of goons.<br /><br />After catching and offing a local witch, Hansel and Gretel discover that the witches are planning a massive sacrifice during a forthcoming Blood Moon. Even worse, the witches are led by a Grand Witch named Muriel (Famke Jansson) who knows the secrets of the siblings' past, and the true reason their parents abandoned them. Defeating her and her followers might be more than even Hansel and Gretel can handle.<br /><br />My biggest problem with \\"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters\\" is that it never quite makes up its mind what it wants to be -- it's too serious to be a dark comedy, but still too tongue-in-cheek to be a straight action movie. It vacillates between the two extremes constantly. But either way, it's a fun brainless movie, with buckets of gore and anachronistic weapons (Hansel's love-interest Mina blasts witches with a FRICKING GATLING GUN!).<br /><br />So if you expect a mindless, tongue-in-cheek gorefest, this movie will probably fit the bill. Is it a great movie? Not really. Is it fun? Yeah!  It's not even trying to be \\"authentic,\\" so it succeeds wildly.<br /><br />Wirkola is pretty obviously reveling in the ability to create a \\"dark fairy tale\\" with a firm R-rating. It could have used some subplot-pruning (Thomas Mann's \\"fanboy\\" character is just distracting), but the central tale is a pretty straightforward one. The fun comes from the one-liners (\\"I hate to break this to you, but this isn't gonna be an open casket\\"), the B-movie stunts and sets, and the gore. Did I mention the gore? Because there's a lot of it, and it's fun.<br /><br />Wirkola also seems to enjoy showing Renner and Arterton getting beaten up, because nearly every scene with ANY action involves them getting slammed into rocks, knocked senseless, and occasionally stabbed. The Grimm siblings certainly earn their money.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton honestly couldn't look any LESS like siblings, but both look like they're having a blast as leather-clad, cussing bounty hunters who constantly wave around absurd weapons (Hansel's hilariously phallic gun). They are perfectly suited to the dry, tongue-in-cheek approach of the script, and they even get some interesting character twists, such as Hansel suffering from diabetes because of his all-candy diet as a child.<br /><br />\\"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters\\" is by no means a great film, but it is a resolutely fun one -- lots of splattered body parts, screeching witches and gleeful anachronisms.

B009LDXQGW|5.0|I haven't purchased an actual CD for myself in over 10 years. I listen to a lot of music, but it's hard to come by music I can listen to for a week straight and still want to buy the CD after. While I now know almost all the Weeknd's songs by heart and will definitely be listening to them for weeks to come, I mainly purchased Trilogy because this is the first time in a while I've felt the need to give back to an artist for the auditory experience his/her music has given to me.<br /><br />Trilogy is a perfect title for the three albums, as the Weeknd's music tells a story and takes you to another world, just like a good book. Put aside a few hours, listen to the songs in order and just zone in...
B000HZHBIM|5.0|Always a great movie. This is a movie that has been, is, and always will be a classic. I am a trekker through and through.

B0095P3ULC|3.0|Transformers has plenty of great action scenes in it, which is why I put it on in the first place. I wanted to test out the new tv I bought and see how it looked with an HD movie.<br />The movie had so many unnecessary tangents to the story and poor dialogue. The acting was pretty bad as well for most of the characters.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I am always kept guessing what is going to happen next. With this show I often guess wrong which is delightful. Great story line and character development. When the plot becomes silly, it is forgivable because it is a fairy tale after all.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|A year ago, I had noticed that my laptop fan would be quite loud and full speed the entire time I was using it. My laptop is about 6 years old and I've managed to keep it in good condition so far but the sound it was making was much longer and more noticeable than it had ever been. Then one day it shut off on me and gave me some errors. I used a software to check the processor temperature and noticed that it would get very high and the fan didn't seem to bring it back down. After some research I discovered that the thermal paste probably needed to be replaced.<br /><br />I was able to open my laptop and access the processor and remove the old dried paste that was between it and the heat sink. I used this arctic silver paste to replace the old stuff and put it all back together. I then used the software to determine the processor temperature after the procedure. The temperature was much lower and the fan was quieter. I have not had any more errors since and the computer has run much cooler this past year than it had previously. Hopefully this will extend my laptop's life for a few more years.

There is some obvious product placement, but I am willing to forgive that because the story is fantastic. I am surprised we don't see Anna Torv in more things. She really begins to shine in the third season.

B005LAII80|5.0|My husband and I both love this movie.  Normally, the slow motion scenes would be annoying, however they are done in a way that makes sense and is entertaining to watch.  This isn't your Stallone Judge Dredd (thank goodness, that one was so bad).<br /><br />This is the Dredd I remember reading in the comic books for years.  Gritty, dark, pretty good acting, excellent action scenes and a fun story line.  We watched it 4 times in 2 days which is a record for us.  A must have for real Dredd fans.

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I found this show on Amazon Instant Video years after it went off the air. I love these characters. I appreciate a show that has characters who are instrumental in the story, but who also have smaller story arcs about them as individuals. Excellent show.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a Great series and the download quality was very good. We had watched Series 1 and were eager to access Season 2 while we were traveling. .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game ever by kiloo and i like it better than both temple run and temple run2
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really loved this show. I liked the story line. The year it was set in was great. Makes you stop and wonder how you would relate to the story if you was living it along side them. The family upstairs, and the help downstairs.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I CAN'T SAY ANY THING I WAS LEFT SPEECH LESS IT WAS A WONDERFUL BOOK I RECCOMMED IT FOR ANYONE!!!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Works perfect great sound and mic options are amazing.  Everything plugs in with ease as no real difficult set up.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|For all you bike fans, if your thinking about purchasing the<br />RAM X mount to hold your phone on your bike, this mount<br />will insure that you won't ever loose your phone to the road.<br />Other RAM packages for bike mounts have the strap that goes<br />around the handle bars and fits back in the base of the mount.<br />This configuration is not very secure as the 1&#34; ball will move around<br />on your handle bars when you hit bumps and such.  With this<br />unit, it won't move unless you loosen the screws.  I will be purchasing<br />another one for my road bike so I don't have to swap this hard mount<br />back and forth from my Mountain bike.
B005R32L66|3.0|Haven't used it much yet but think it will be fine.  Altho' when we were trying it first we kept getting cut off.<br />Think we have to be closer to router to stay connected.
B0001XLXDO|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for, i had the album but wanted the sound track on cd...I am very happy with my purchase.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|This a great action movie, on par with MI:3, however, not as good mind you, but still a solid action spy movie nevertheless.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Arrived quickly and in new condition as stated my kids loved it and whom am I kidding my wife and I loved it as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Definitely worth the money of 6.99 but the computer version is better but is 27.99<br />Definitely 5stars.<br /><br />A must buy for any gamer
B005OCFGTO|4.0|The only complaint I have is that I didn't realize that the widescreen format would be so small on my widescreen tv....I have to zoom in the picture.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple, easy to use calculator with large display and large number to press. The ads banner on top is not too intrusive or distracting. I definitely recommend this app for basic calculations.
B00A8LYYI0|4.0|This is an o.k. movie, the story line was predictable and the acting was terrible except for Sean Bean and Malcolm Mcdowell. That being said the 3d effects were awesome it had my wife jumping in her seat and it made me blink once or twice they really did an a excellent job.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Ssh h f2f f th vs f2f handcuff thing think high fight b hi I vlog you think tank did

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm a horror buff. Love the Walking Dead. Would by advanced episodes if I could. Excellent writing, interesting characters and more drama and adventure than I expected.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Book two, Clash of Kings is a great follow up to book one.  Great read and hard to put down.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|With so much talk around about this one, I thought I'd give it a try. It's kind of got a story line, with lots of sex thrown in, but I couldn't really get passed the question of why this silly immature girl could possibly be interested in this mean guy?  But I guess thats the whole point of the story, young innocent girl gets taught about sex by an older more experienced guy.  Ultimately I couldn't relate to either character, and skimmed through the second half of the book.
B001KDQ4KQ|1.0|I have to say first, I have really enjoyed many of Jodi Picoult's books.  Her Sister's Keeper and Plain Truth to mention two, but this one left me not only wanting answers but very disturbed at the relationship of Emily and Chris.  This kid who is supposed to be so in tuned to this girl he is obsessed with her decides not only not to stop her when she fixes on suicide, but to help her.  Spoiler alert!  I was especially appalled at the outcome of the court case.  I have been a juror on a murder trial and there is no way I could ever see 12 people letting this kid go and calling him 'not guilty' after hearing this testimony.  This author is out in left field somewhere.  I was so saddened to see that so many people gave this five stars.  It fell flat in so many ways, characters you care about, plot, totally unbelievable outcomes.  She is a fine author, but she really dropped the ball with this one.  Don't waste your time or money.  I plan to delete it off my kindle as soon as possible.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I'm addicted to this show. It can't come on fast enough for me. I love the writing and the cliffhanger.
B006LSZECO|4.0|In a very satisfying way!  A real page turner!  The ending is disappointing but only in the sense that human nature is disappointing.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Great acting, very interesting story that has many seasons of mysteries that need solving. I'm totally hooked. Give it a watch you won't be dissapointed.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|This is an incredible deal! The Blu-Rays work great and they arrived on time. I would recommend this to anyone who loves this show!!
B00881VLCE|3.0|It has quite working.  My wife had a lot of fun with it untill it quit working  fill fill fill
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|What struck me was what Gary said in his book and that is your motivation in doing the 5 Love Languages is not to get something in return.  Rather, you do it just because you want your spouse to feel he/she is truly loved.  When you put it that way, it makes it so much easier.  And so I tried doing it and it has really brought significant positive changes in my relationship with my husband.  We're still a long way from home but I think this is one big step.
B009IF82SK|3.0|While there was always a little sexual undertone with the tension between Penny and the others, this season has become a non-stop barrage of sexual innuendo and jokes.  It is unnecessary.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Wow what a movie! It surely did deserve the win. Great effort from Ben. This would be another one we would love to add to our library. Great audio and video quality.
1936608898|5.0|I cannot thank Dallas & Melissa enough for writing this book! It has completly changed my life!!! GET THIS BOOK AND CHANGE YOUR LIFE, TOO!!! Give this 30 days and you will be hooked just like I am!<br /><br />I am amazed at how my body is changing eating this way. It gets easy after the first week because your cravings go away. Weight is just falling off and I feel wonderful for the first time in a very long time. Not only is the weight falling off, but it's falling off in a better way than other diets I've been on in the past. My skin is looking much better as well. I feel the life coming back into my body each and every day. I've lost 19 pounds so far in just 6 weeks! The weightloss is very steady. I am now losing 2 to 3 pounds each week without any problem.<br /><br />Those of you that are reading this that have been sick and or overweight a long time....PLEASE give this a chance! Words cannot describe how thankful I am for finally finding the answer to my health and weight issues. I only wish I had known about this 20 years ago before I started getting sick and fat. I am now 39 years old. I believe the key is not only getting the junk out of your diet but also getting the hidden food intolerances out as well.<br /><br />My health issues \\"were\\" as follows - PCOS, Hoshimoto Autoimmune Thyroid disease, Systemic Candidia problems, Allergies, Chronic fatigue, Fibromyalgia like symptoms, Vertigo and major weight gain of 80+ pounds from all of this and hormone problems. I had been dealing with these health issues for 18 long years. I also had some depression from all this, but who wouldn't in my shoes?<br /><br />Now that I am almost 7 weeks into this way of eating I consider myself almost well. Yes, I feel that much better! All my pain is gone! My energy level is great now. I sleep better and feel more rested. That horrible bloated feeling and edema is gone. I still have some mild lingering candidia issues and mild Vertigo from time to time. I know that in time thesethings will clear up also.<br /><br />My family and friends are already amazed at how much better I look and feel. I have so much energy now and want to do so many things. I am, for the first time in many years, full of hope and excited about my life. I will need to go back to the doctor to confirm that my thyroid is better. I know that it must be because I feel too good for it not to be. My hormones feel more balanced...I feel more balanced in general. This is one diet that I can stick to for life with NO problem! I am one happy girl that I found this book! :)<br /><br />UPDATE: May 6, 2013<br />I am still going strong on this plan. I have yet to go to my doctor to confirm any blood work that shows I am healed. To be perfectly honest I don't need a doctor or blood work to tell me this because I feel healed in my body. I feel amazing!!! Plus, I think it will be kind of funny to shock my doctor when I get to at least a 50 pound weight loss. lol! Who knows, maybe he'll take it to heart what I tell him and recommend this book to others. Can't hurt to try.<br /><br />I have recently started to walk 2 miles per day (3 or 4 days per week) and working out a little. This is a very big deal for me because I was really sick for many years and never felt like working out or doing much walking. I am now down a total of 34 pounds. I still have a ways to go but I am confidant that I will meet and maybe even exceed my goal within this next year. There is absolutly NO better way of getting healthy and losing weight, PERIOD! Believe me, I've tried it all over the last 18+ years! Nothing has ever worked so well for me. This book is changing many lives for the better. I know it has 100% changed my life. You can not go wrong getting this book.....so long as you give it a chance and try it for 30 days!

B009X01ELC|5.0|The case arrived quickly.  It works great and was a very good price.  Seems very durable and looks very nice.
B00020HEG6|5.0|i love this cd- it is a harry potter soundtrack, which is always a good thing. john williams did a great job in composing the album for the movie- it has both sad and happy elements, and at times can be highly dramatic, completely recommend it to anyone interested
B005FDW7AI|5.0|The movie a little princess from amazon. Com, is agreat movie a good movie for the family. About alittle girl that had t go t a girl finishing school.

B00004XMSN|5.0|&#34;New&#34; movie for us to watch at christmas. Acting good, nice teaching movie, appropriate for the whole family. Will lend to family members.
B000OLGCHA|5.0|for all you soundtrack lovers out there, this is one great cd to have. especially considering it is a harry potter cd, and i am currently working on collecting all the soundtracks for the harry potter series. this particular cd has some whimsical songs (professor umbridge) hat are just lovely, but theres also an frenzied and sad tone among the songs as well. get it, you will love it
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great free application. I use it as a secondary alarm, and it has never failed. I also use this as a travel alarm.

B00005JPD0|4.0|Added to my collection, but have not had a chance to watch it yet. It will be on my to do list this next weekend.
B000BGH22W|5.0|i love soundtracks, and if you do, get this cd.  you can't go wrong with the harry potter soundtracks and patrick doyle did an amazing job composing this album. it is highly whimsical and energetic and the additional fun songs at the end of the album are a nice feature.
B00067BBSC|5.0|Growing up in the late 70's and 80's, I loved ToTo then, after the 80's were over I kinda forgot about the group as themselves, but still would sing the songs when I heard them on the Classic Rock station.<br />A couple of months ago I happened to hear &#34;Africa&#34; on the car radio.  I ran inside to check out youtube to see if they carry any ToTo<br />songs, well to my delite, they happen to have alot about ToTo.  Concerts from almost any year they toured up until now, I started reading about the group and their hardships, triumphs, and lives.  They are SUCH a awesomel group of guys and just the most talented all over musicians in the industry, I believe.<br />Todays artists usually just sing, if you want to call that singing.  We, growing up in the 80's were so lucky to have the music we did.  Played right and sung right by musicians, not just singers.  Toto is so multi talented, they write, play multiple instruments, produce all their music, and perform all their music and also have written for and played as studio session musicians with some of the biggest names in the business.<br />They are just the greatest all around great sounding GROUP EVER!!!!<br />Buy this CD, it's just the greatest peformance I've ever seen from a musical group!  I feel like I'm there too!<br />I so hope they tour the US for their 35th anniversary tour, this summer or next summer, I don't want to miss an opp to see them, although some of the players, sadly have changed.<br />RIP Jeff Porcaro......the greatest drummer ever and<br />GOD BLESS Mike Porcaro....suffering from ALS, the greatest Bass player ever
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Its a good show that, I thin, would fall into the same category as the X-Files.  My favorite character is Walter BIshop (the guy that played Denethor in the LOTR movies.
0307891372|5.0|Didnt help me very much, but i always love looking and reading about the stats. For an average gamer it does help a lot, however im a speed runner, i completed the game in (2:45Hours). Its now outdated since the game has of 1000 patches and 4-6 new dlc.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|The book is truly a masterpiece but a bit hard to read. There are too many description at  times and everything happens with a slow pace.  Nevertheless  Les Miserables is a book everyone should read.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun time spender,you need to wait in between turn to power up. other than that I like it. great version. at no cost!!! I would recommend
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Like it even more after seeing the concert in Love in Portofino. Great concert as are all his concerts. Great!
0062209493|5.0|My husband love this book, said it really did not just show that Chris Kyle was a good soldier, but a good man, husband, and daddy.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|I needed this adapter because I wanted to hook an Apple TV to an older Samsung LCD in my kitchen. The TV didn't have HDMI or Optical in, but it did have DVI and analog (red/white) in. The FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter worked perfectly! It has two pleasant lights that indicate power and a locked signal. The small box does not get warm at all. It can be powered by both usb or a regular two prong outlet. I have had no problems or audio drops. I would recommend this product because of ease of use, setup, and value.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I sat through. Terribly disjointed. If I had gone to the show and paid for my wife and I to see it in the theater we both agree we would have left.
B004IFYN2E|1.0|I have 3 blu-ray players in my house that are used on a regular basis.  I am telling you this, so you will know there is nothing wrong with any of my blu-ray players.  This disk will only play on our play-station.  It will not work on our other blu-ray players.  I think this is a copy of an original disk.  When the disk first arrived, I noticed the wrapping did not look original.  The wrapping was too loose.  I will not be purchasing from this company again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it it was an amazing story I wish there were more books. Suzanne Collins keep going! Anything can happen in panem!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Reels you right in!  Quirky!  But really keeps your interest.  I would recommend this television series to anyone who is into science and has a sense of humor.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|If you liked \\"Tailgates and Tanlines\\" and all of his other music, this is the CD for you. This'll be in my CD player for a very long time. Great cruising the town music. Happy Spring Break!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This book was delightfully quirky. Kind of a nerd-tastic version of the Da Vinci code. If you like this book, The Night Circus and Miss Peregrine's Home or Peculiar Children should be next on you list!
B00899F0G8|5.0|I watch this show every week and it is by far my favorite. Being able to watch it on my kindle is even more convenient and the quality is excellent!
1608955702|5.0|I have enjoyed reading Neil van Niekerk's previous books, and I looked forward to reading his newest release to complete the trilogy. Fully expecting it to be an extension of the prior two, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was so much more. I think Neil has created the new, de facto standard for anyone wanting to learn how to use and create light for portraiture. Neil's embraceable writing style coupled with extensive, well-detailed sample photos make his concepts easy for the reader to grasp and apply to their own work. I heartily recommend this book, and it is a steal at twice the price!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Interesting and clever - but no 5 stars!! The story was a little contrived but entertaining none the less. I can't say I would recommend it to a serious reader.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game you try it out. I love this game i play this one all the time.this is worth five stars.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game. So addictive u can use real money to buy accounts which I do lol. But they are given to u for free. This game does often run slow though which is. Very annoying. But I love it
B009RH9J7W|5.0|The people who ding this due to the charging ports being on the wrong side need to be smacked upside the head with it.  It spins around so you can charge it as expected.<br /><br />I went with this item as it was the closest I could find to the original kindle marware product I bought before.  While not identical, it is close and some features are better.  It's still growing on me, but I would give it 4.75 stars two weeks in.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best calculater app EVER! It has amazing features and is easy to use! Plus; it's completly free! If you need a calculater; this is the app to use! ;)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I would recommend this YOUVERSION BIBLE APP to folks like me--that is, a busy person looking to find time for God's word. If you find yourself hurrying up and then waiting in little pockets of time, until your tasks can be completed; the YOUVERSION BIBLE APP is a gift to yourself: With it, you can be fulfilled in your work AND by the Word of God, which is life.<br /><br />I would recommend the YOUVERSION BIBLE APP, because it is easy to choose the version you like (I slip back and forth between KJV and the Amplified version, myself.) It's easy to change the font, whether you need gigantic text (like I do), or whether the smaller size is legible for you. There are lighting options, bookmarking options, highlighting options, etc., if you need to alter those for your own reasons. And, readers can easily choose books and chapters within those books of the YOUVERSION BIBLE APP.<br /><br />This reader was set once I chose the version and font that works for me. I just started at Genesis. ;-)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I Really like this game.  I think I may have actually learned something I can use for r my real horse.  Wish I could get more healthy treats sooner.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this Holy Bible version from YouVersion daily for a number of different devotionals on my droid phone.  This way I can take it with me wherever I go and use it whenever.  It's also good to use by computer via email.  Thank you for such a great solution for Bible reading and the many plans to choose from!
B005KELWJY|5.0|I had ordered a Belkin cover before and liked it so much that I ordered one for my Paper White Kindle too. I especially like the magnet closure. It is not leather and somewhat expensive but I found it better than other cheaper covers I had bought before because it is sturdy, not too heavy and, as I said, the magnet closure clinched it for me because it is so much more convenient than sliding straps over the cover that soon wear out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My granddaughter who is 5 plays this game on my kindle everytime she visits. Now I can't stop playing either. Love this game so much
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Again, I cannot say enough about this series.  Excellent reading and very easly something to reread.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|First two seasons were great, the third a bummer, killed off two of the best chacters. Probaby the best TV program ever to watch.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|While I like some songs more than others, overall this is a great album. I bought this when it was offered for $5 and I used my Amazon MP3 credit that I had so I got it for free! If you love Josh Groban's other albums, you will like this one. His voice is as pure and beautiful as ever. I recommend it!
B0068FYZIO|5.0|This is an excellent movie that tells a little of the horrors of the Nazi death camps. The actors did a wonderful job, especially Liam Neeson and it was a beautiful movie that showed how one man tried and succeeded to help hundreds of jews live.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I definitely like the first 2 books and they are a book to hold your interest and find out what is going to happen next.  something I would recommend people to read.
0316153826|3.0|Book in poor shape. Binding broke and pages bent and dirty. First time to be disappointed in purchase of book.
0740797719|5.0|The book,COLOR AND LIGHT , is a beautiful and  useful instructional book for a realist artist desiring to learn more about using color to express light in a painting.I found the Dinontopia series on TV and realized that this book  quite accurately demonstrates the authors vision.
B008BM9L72|3.0|Not the best read; the first in the series is certainly the most 'hectic' so to speak; the 'bedroom scenes' do get a bit tiresome but there is quite a sweet love story amongst it all. Had to work to finish the 3rd book.
B00846REIS|3.0|I think it is ok, it seems to jump around a lot for me... 50 shades was still my number 1 choice
B00092ZMDY|4.0|A little disappointed in sound track, not as clear and crisp as Hell Freezes Over concert. I have a home theater and the effect of live concert was not there
1616550414|5.0|The Legend of Zelda is by far my favourite video game series of all time, and having all this extra information on the series, and the prequel manga chapter int he back made my decade. Concept art, the timeline, just every little thing was great, even the stuff on my less favourite games (such as the Adult Link Timeline).<br />I love the book and I can't wait to see what's next.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This game greatly reminded me of the Diablo series. For fans of the adventurous hack and slash games, this is a game recommended for you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I definitely think this is a very well written book.  You need to know why Christian is the way he is... A book that can be rered wthout hesitation.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I loved this book. It was a slow start, but it really picked up and the ending was amazing and unexpected.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Really good, a nice break from all the murder, blood and guts that is mainly on tv shows.  Keep up the good work Masterpeice Theater.
B0018GRAE4|5.0|good luck finding a bad song by them. i actually already had this alblum but i was missing a few songs so i rebought  the whole album
B004UID2LC|5.0|I don't know about everybody else but I love this app because you can download anything from youtube that you want for free!! You can also download music! I use this app all the time. If your like me and don't want to spend money on videos and music then get this app
0062014536|5.0|I had a significant number of worries coming into Requiem. This book was easily my most anticipated read of 2013; I've invested so much emotion and energy into this story and its characters. Delirium easily stands as one of my favourite books ever.<br /><br />But there was so much riding on this one little book! I'd say that Alex, rather than Lena, is my favourite character of the bunch and Pandemonium just didn't seem to set things up for the ending I wanted to see. And there's always something heartbreaking about the ending of a series; bittersweet, like saying goodbye to old, familiar friends.<br /><br />I'll say right away that I was not nearly as disappointed or as devastated as most other readers seemed to be by Requiem. It made me look at the trilogy from a whole new light, and I'm curious to see how I'll feel after re-reading the three books. Also: this review is the hardest one I've ever written, hands down.<br /><br />Reasons to Read:<br /><br />1. A story about love that's about more than romance:<br /><br />One thing I've noticed is how easy it is for us readers to get caught up in the Julian/Alex debate. But while reading Requiem, I soon became aware that this was not the biggest focus of the book or even the series. I'm so appreciative that Lauren Oliver took the chance to explore other avenues of love, from the relationship between Lena and her mother, to her best friend Hana, to the deep, life-altering friendships she makes in The Wilds and within the resistance. I think it's easy for us to focus so much on these swoon-worthy boys that we miss some of the other heartbreaking moments; for me, it was notably the deterioration of Lena and Hana's friendship and Lena's lack of a relationship with her mother, Annabel. And you know what? I was honestly & pleasantly surprised by how much Requiem didn't focus on the romance. That's a blessing in YA these days and really great for those who want to see more from a book than just romance. Yet it still has some of the best romance I've ever read about (in the series, as a whole).<br /><br />2. Lena's epic character transformation:<br /><br />I'd hate to call this \\"character development\\" because it's much more than that - rather, it's more like an evolution. When you compare the old Lena from Delirium to the changing Lena in Pandemonium with the new Lena in Requiem, it becomes apparent how drastic these changes have been. Yet, one thing I noticed re-reading Delirium is that the seeds of change were already planted in Lena before Alex ever came along. I might even say that she's more like her mother than she may ever realize. But I believe it is entirely consistent with her character and who she is for this transformation to take place.<br /><br />3. A world falling apart:<br /><br />One of my favourite parts of this series is that Lauren has so much attention on the world she's created, and really works to bring it to life through her stories. I found Requiem to have a bit more of an emphasis on this, and we really get to see a society that's crumbling apart. I'm incredibly curious to know what happens in the future, but I think it's clear that big changes are coming for society.<br /><br />4. Hana offers a fresh perspective to the book:<br /><br />Hana is easily one of the most interesting characters from the Delirium cast, and I think this is another reason in support of saying that by Requiem, it's very clear that the books are about so much more than a love triangle or even just Lena's life. While Lena is busy with the resistance, Hana is our insider view to Portland and the \\"upper class\\" of that community. I found Hana's story to have the potential to be just as heartbreaking as Lena's, and her voice stood out so much from Lena's narrative that it was a great way to freshen up the series.<br /><br />I'll also admit that it would take a lot for me to truly hate this book - I'm well aware that I'm biased (and maybe partially blinded?) by my love for these books. And I can understand why so many readers may be disappointed by how few plot elements are actually wrapped up. That is disappointing, but I can see how the open-endedness works well too. (For me, I'm happily convinced that Alex and Lena are together forever and have ten happy little babies and they spend a lot of time reading poetry and kissing. It doesn't matter what happens in these books, that has always been the ending I invented.)<br /><br />I was, however, a tad disappointed with Lena at a few points. I was surprised by her reactions a few times, particularly when it came to Alex and Julian because most of that felt so immature. While something so big is happening with the resistance, it didn't fit to have so much angst between a handful of characters about personal problems. Maybe it was the stress of it all that brought out their worst, but it largely felt out of character to me (and yes, I'm pointing my blame-finger at you too, Alex).<br /><br />I've tried my best to be spoiler-free here, but I have a lot of ideas and thoughts I'd like to discuss more in a spoiler-friendly format. So expect a spoiler-y letter where I vent all my feelings to Lena for catharsis. SOON.<br /><br />And I'm most excited to read the special short from Alex's POV in the first edition Requiem books! I'm hoping that it will give me my necessary dose of Alex Sheathes &lt;3<br /><br />ARC received from HarperCollins Canada for review; no other compensation was received.n understand why so many readers may be disappointed by how few plot elements are actually wrapped up.

B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is an excellent 3-dimensional Mah-Jong type game. The 6x6x6 cube contains 108 pairs of mini-cubes which when clicked in pairs, disappear and expose underlying cubes. You are rated by both minimum time and score. Score increases when less time passes between pair eliminations. Great graphics - including easy rotation of the main cube. A very well done and addictive game. Thanks to the author.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I ordered this producted for my son. He needed it for his project of putting a computer together.  The producted work very good for the propose he needed it for.

B0036TGT3E|5.0|We love any classic disney movies and The lion King happened to be our one of favorite moment because it is a real stories about the lions.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent acting, captivating story, great history, I'm hooked!! Love the costumes and settings!Hope there are lots more seasons to come.
B0007GBBVO|4.0|I love 3D. This works on HD tvs. I have glasses from other movies and they work with this movie. It is an older movie but good. I turn the lights out and pretend I am at a 3D movie.
B002S218P4|5.0|His unique styles and ways of blending together classical, afro-cuban, the various<br />styles that have their origins in Cuba, added to her voicings makes it so fine.  Chucho's latest<br />group played in LA a few months ago and raised the roof off the place- incredible musicianship<br />amongst his very young band.
B001L70HTK|5.0|Thank you for the book very new and neat. My daughter love it and very proud to own the book in her room.
B00063EMJ6|3.0|As a music freak, I was kind of disappointed that the remastered sound really wasn't any better than the original. On almost all Neil Young recordings, there is some static in it. It's especially noticeable as the song fades out.. You would think this would have been eliminated in a remastered version
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|Received mine today and the back clasp design is bad.  It would work great, just need to redesign using the exact copy of the back plate of the mouse. They deviated the clasp somewhat and that seems to be the problem.  They also should have made the battery pack just slightly shallower.  I was really looking forward to this.  Maybe they will redesign.
B00A4VGUIG|1.0|This is for a child's enjoyment. Limited plot. Character graphics are poor and dolphin interaction is juvenile. Sorry I purchased this app.
B0061QD82E|5.0|Thank you very much for the movie! It's very new just like you go to the store to buy it. I will order anything from that person in the future!
B008LFY6NI|4.0|I KNOW this is a simple premise--swirling various choices of colors onto a spinning shape. But, I find SpinArt to be enjoyable and relaxing. I know it is easy to create the pictures, but it is nice to use to relax and see what colorful combinations I can make. I usually find myself playing SpinArt at least once or twice each day.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Loved  the movie and the discs were in great condition!!!  I watch it all the time, music is great in this movie!
B00AA0TZTW|2.0|The new Jimi Hendrix cd, People, Hell & Angels<br />Comparing it to the sappy stuff that is being released these days in modern music, this is brilliant and cutting edge, get it.<br />Lifelong Hendrix fans already have better versions of these songs already. So buy this, turn on, then find the versions we've all loved for years. Is that their goal?<br /><br />Thank you for the break down, Christopher Elliot.<br /><br />\\"People, Hell and Angels\\" features 12 songs that Hendrix recorded in 1968 and 1969, many of which were intended for the studio follow-up to \\"Electric Ladyland.\\"<br /><br />Here's the collection of all the stuff they tossed then swept off the floor that someone was supposed to put in a trash can. Who took it out, WHO TOOK IT OUT!?<br /><br />I've loved Jimi's music since being 10 years old, back in 1967.<br />A couple nice moments here (just from familiarity), not many at all.<br /><br />Spend your $10 on a couple gallons of gas and crank up some other Hendrix as you travel the highways of life.<br /><br />Looks like the Hendrix family has posted some uplifting reviews here,themselves's<br />Who else could have posted such up lifting, shinning reviews who loves Jimi's music?<br /><br />Sorry but this and the last release, Valleys of Neptune is doing nothing but making hard core, lifelong fans angry.<br /><br />Artiest get upset about people listening to their stuff on the internet. The other side of the coin, we consumers can save cash from buying clunkers.<br /><br />Real Hendrix fan's will say, \\"A collection of the worst versions of these songs I've ever heard.\\"<br /><br />Just a tip here, don't think we'll need a new version of Purple Haze summer of 2014 either.
B0042FZOFU|4.0|It said its never open as brand new. It was already open as I test  on the blu ray disc and the movies are excellent no blur, freeze, or damage at all. Thank you
B00005N6KG|5.0|At first you are very aware t h at they are in your ears, but after a minute or two, you only become aware of the very pleasant sounds coming from them. Extremely LIGHTWEIGHT and easy to wear for longer lengths of time. R.E.W.
B00BEQZK5Y|5.0|This is the best album since Infinite. I have always been a fan of Timo and Jorg. But this album seems like a fresh start for the band.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked it a lot it was a good book because of its huge action and big inner testing topicad
1616550414|5.0|I was so happy to find out this was being released in English, and for such a great price! This is an amazing resource for any LoZ aficionado. The pages are of course great quality, and the concept art is fun to see. I think my favourite thing is that they include the various Hylian alphabets in here, though I love the timeline as well. I am definitely using this to plan out my Zelda sleeve tattoo. :)
B00BKEMX28|4.0|In order to stay objective I need to preface my review by saying I'm a big fan of pretty much anything Reznor puts out.  For instance, I really enjoy Ghosts as well as the prior How to Destroy Angels Eps, whereas most reviews on the these albums/EPs were mixed.<br /><br />On this album, I assume most people will have an issue with Mariqueen Maandig-Reznor's voice and lyrics, which don't seem to immediately gel with the unique sounds produced by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.  Personally, as far as Mariqueen's lyrics, I don't really relate; and when Reznor does occasionally provide back-up vocals, it does seem like a relief - his tone and pitch are perfect accompaniments to his sound.  These are really the only issues I have and assume most will have with the album...<br /><br />Purposely keeping my review short, I'd sum up by saying the album is great, not perfect, but welcomed into my fan-boy catalogue.  If you're a NIN or Reznor/Ross fan you'll most likely enjoy this album...if you don't like NIN or Reznor's other efforts, I'm not even sure how you found this album.  4/5 stars.
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|Deep space 9 is a blend of Sci-Fy and real world issues facing mankind everyday. True to the Star Trek story line Deep Space ( delivers.
B003719G40|5.0|This book has help save my marriage. I would highly  recommend this book. This book teaches you what your love language is, therefore you will be able to moved forword. wonderful  book.
0007229682|4.0|I wanted to go for the UK release version of this book since I found out there was an abridged American version floating around. What's up with that anyway? I got this to find out more about Chef Ramsay after getting hooked on his TV shows. At times, reading it made me like him more, and at others, made me dislike him greatly, specifically whenever he talked about women. I guess some people still have a ways to go in that department. In the end it cooled my fangirlism towards him, but it was a very interesting read.
B005T4SW7K|4.0|I heard about the BBC program and had to get this book.  I like it, it's well written and I like how the importance of each object is presented in just a few pages.  That makes it easy to pick up and put down without losing your place.
B00AA2ONDI|4.0|This story is a fun family adventure mixed with brain and bronze. Its a fast pace masterpiece of childhood fantasy.
B004D20JP2|5.0|Animation similar to the stop n' go video works from Adam Jones of TOOL.<br /><br />The circle of life happens before a young man's eyes as he tries to save a sorry, mismatched group of animals.  He earns the most respect of anyone of his town.<br /><br />I love the expressions of the cat.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|The HD version had a few hiccups while we were watching it.  It froze to upload the HD 3 times while we were watching the movie, which stopped the whole flow of watching an action film.  So with the movie interrupted 3 times make it just an okay screening.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|This book just doesn't stop, it had me from Chapter 1!  The only thing that I question though is how amazing lucid the man seems for someone who was often abusing drugs, but I allowed for artistic license.  I lent it to a friend who is not a big reader, but it turned him onto the Peppers' music and he went and bought his own copy too!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Fairly factual assessment of what it takes to get from civilian to beady-eyed killer.  Good description of what it takes to prepare for a difficult operation and the reason planning and rehearsal are so important.  Must read for any ex-SOF types.
B00884GR0W|1.0|So I get the game and start exploring. I dig down to find a cave full of monsters. I walk down and see how lifelike they are. They start attacking me and killed me. It scared the poop out of me. THIS APP IS TERRIFYING!
B000M341RI|5.0|I am a Robert Carlyle fan.  So I had to see this movie. After watching it several times I realize I love it not because of just him.  The cast is wonderful and they are all funny in their own ways. I will not go over what the movie is about because after the other reviewes you already know.  It isnt just a chick flick.  The only thing is I'm from the states so some of the terms they use you may have to think about what they are talking about, but for some reason I didnt have that much of a problem.  Great movie!!
B004GTLFNW|5.0|I love this book, I love how there are so many variations of exercises that you can do with just your own body weight!  I'm not much for going and sweating it out in the gym so this book is great for me. Oh, and I have his app too, it's fantastic because it has video of how to do the exercise, and you can set up a routine as you like or follow one of the pre-mades. Whether you buy the book or the app - you can't go wrong with this guy.
B004V4420U|5.0|I wish I found out this book before. Almost every item is very useful, and the reason behind every suggested practice is well explained. One of those book that every developer should have read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I did not think Season 2 would live up to the hype after a great Season 1 run.  It did.
B004EHZPEG|5.0|Author describes his view on development of games. Examples from Magic: The Gathering to projects for Disneyland.<br /><br />Book is filled with interesting ideas and approaches for game development.<br /><br />It is totally worth to read more than once. Don't believe to reviews - just try a sample.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|Sons of Anarchy is my FAVORITE show!! I can't believe its still 6 more months until season 6! :'(<br />Don't know what I'm going to do for the next 6 months!
B005LAII12|5.0|This movie is hilarious. I got it for my older brother for Christmas, knowing that he has seen it and loves it. He like Seth McFarlane and Family Guy too. Movie arrived on time and as described and was reasonably priced. This is the unrated version - I don't think kids should see any version of this though! It is pretty raunchy at times. Just for adults.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The graphics are eye catching and add to the visuals. The same thrills and twists and turns that made #1 fun keep you coming back for just one more time. Hard to put down.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Easy to use, and very handing for appointments and other uses..Thank You I would recommend this notebook to other people.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|This was a pretty good movie with a few plot twists. Not bad for free. Tommy Lee Jones always delivers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played in a long time. I would not do anything to improve it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is cool the only thing is it takes a wile to upload. Also it is a realistic type game the horses look and act real.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I love movies n when I saw the price for it. I said to myself that I have to have this movie. I love this movie a lot.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is one of many games that I check in with a couple of times a day.  I don't spend real money on it and I play just fine.  I am not sure what kind of game people are looking for when they pay nothing.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Listened to this the day it arrived and then listened to it all over again.  I think Buddy Miller's production is a nice touch. I love hearing Richard Thompson play his guitar, with its trademark sound. He includes it all, bawdy humor, love and aching loss. No one does it like Richard Thompson.
1575666286|5.0|Have bought this book for myself and a friend, an absolute must if you are interested in your and your family's health.
B000NA28I4|5.0|I love movies n when I saw the price for it. I said to myself that I have to have this movie. I love this movie a lot.
B002PEP4C8|4.0|Not as good as \\" the lovely bones\\" but it held my interest. The characters were a bit drab and boring.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I enjoy being able to read Kindle ebooks on other devices!  The process of choosing a book through Amazon, uploading the book & reading it on any device is great!
B002361MLA|5.0|This book throws a lot of other theories out the window. If we accept and live in the Now, what a liberating way to be, who needs anything else?<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone.  It is so well written and insightful.<br /><br />Mr Tolle is a master at conveying his message.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I love movies n when I saw the price for it. I said to myself that I have to have this movie. I love this movie a lot.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is so cool I love it. The power ups are very short and that's a bummer but I love when you get in the in that box thing and go all over the place that's coool everything is tight
B001P1MZNI|5.0|I love my kindle, still in the &#34;getting to know you&#34; phase - this is a definite plus! Sinatra does not need my paltry words, I would do this again & again!
B000VOC90Y|4.0|Everything about it is great. It fit a widescreen laptop and all my gear; including 2 iPads. This was a good buy.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|I love movies n when I saw the price for it. I said to myself that I have to have this movie. I love this movie a lot.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|this is a fun game and it challenges your brain. The kids like playing because of the great graphics and sounds
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Only recently was introduced to the series and have been enthralled by the taut writing, solid acting, and the ongoing morality plays inherent in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse.<br /><br />Zipped through the first two seasons (via another streaming service!), but can only access the beginning of Season 3 here. This is the first time I've paid to watch individual episodes but am eager to catch up with the current broadcast schedule!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|love both books cant wait until the 3 book comes out, hope it does not take to long. Deborah Harkness is a great story teller
B006XBSAP2|5.0|I love it I love it I love it I love it that is all I can say is that I love it
B004SRNH10|5.0|I utilze this icon on a constant basis. I would definitely be lost without it. It has proving to be very beneficial and useful at the same time. It have me to be able to processed and use things effectively.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I bought this for my daughter, who has loved this movie since she first saw it as a child.  I think this is what sparked her interest in anime and then in learning to draw in this style. Apparently the author is highly respected amongst anime lovers, and is extremely popular.
B004XANKVO|4.0|Looks fragile but its quite resistant, yet I'll have to test it for real using it in an international trip, that would be the best test these kind of accesories should endure.<br />If you require it to hold your stuff for commuting, its plain awesome!
B004EPZ06G|5.0|I love movies n when I saw the price for it. I said to myself that I have to have this movie. I love this movie a lot.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Love the book and the movie had to admitted I saw the movie first and then decide to read the book great read.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Quick interesting read where the main character is a female. I will be reading the rest of the series to see what the final resolution will be.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Liked the story line but didn't care much for the ending.  Won't stop me from reading more Lee Child books!
B000JRYOPG|5.0|I love it I love it I love it I love it that is all I can say is that I love it
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is a super awesome game! great for all ages! fans of the show will love and respect it due to the fact that it follows the new series quite perfectly!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing! Take it from me its amazing!!! Get it!!!! Now!!!! Don't hold back!!!! My gosh so many different things!!! Beats temple run by a million and two!!!!!
B0031RS44S|4.0|&#34;You dont mess with the special investigators&#34;! I love when Reachers past Army life and characters come into a story. I found this as entertaining and engrossing as all his other books. The ATM card and the numbers thing just seemed to have happened all of a sudden, but hey, shrug and move on...
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love movies n when I saw the price for it. I said to myself that I have to have this movie. I love this movie a lot.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very fast paced concept that holds your interest from beginning to end. The trilogy has sparked an interest in reading among young readers so that in itself is a good recommendation.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very informative and helpful.  Reasons to give up wheat, and how to go about it.  There is not much sacrifice involved.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Great plot and well written.  Did not agree with his ending. Even though the main character went through a lot of trouble, I did not think he deserved to get away with  the &#34;Pot of Gold&#34;<br />He deserved some compensation but because of the way he manipulated the system, he did not deserve what he got away with.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I love movies n when I saw the price for it. I said to myself that I have to have this movie. I love this movie a lot.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a addictive game once you get your city started it mostly runs itself with your help of course the best part of this is I control what to build and where to place it just don't like having to buy more land but when your city grows you have too so build it and they will come...
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This CD beats out any Coldplay CD out there. The songs are incredible. Try out samples of the songs if you are a fan of Coldplay
B0048ZJOP0|5.0|This is a great Christmas album. Mariah has an amazing voice and I listen to this album every year to help get me into the Christmas spirit. Works every time!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I love movies n when I saw the price for it. I said to myself that I have to have this movie. I love this movie a lot.

B0000508U6|5.0|I'm a fan of Coldplay and some few songs are not up to my standards, but once you try out all the songs, little by little, you may take a liking to it.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|Fat Amy was pretty funny, the rest of the storyline was pretty weak. Def a movie I'll only watch just this one time.
B002RKRV4Y|5.0|I loved the way he went back-and-forth between contemplative and more conventional lifestyle. I love the images of the relationship with the river.
B002BGCCZC|5.0|Unbelievable, from the first song to the last! I can`t stop listening to it! No two songs are the same. Just when you think you have heard everything they can do they throw out something new.! Do yourself a favor and buy this album!
B000069AUI|5.0|At least try out the samples of the songs to know if it is worth buying. I love it. Hypnotic is the only way I can explain it.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I really like this app. It helps me know exactly how much time I have left on my Kindle Fire. It is well worth buying and I highly recommend it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I've heard so much  about this book. On Facebook and my curiosity peaked. I decided to give it a try. I was completely shocked. I found this book to be frightening, tantalising, teasing, exciting, and very damn good. I enjoyed this book emensly.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This continues  not to disappoint.. Well done..... I wonder why American TV  is not held to such standards?  do we not deserve good television?  I can't wait for next Season.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|You must like Coldplay to actually like this CD. I did not like a track there that was just song, no singing, but it goes with the theme of the CD. The songs are good and the music is nice tempo. Classic Coldplay.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I enjoy the game.  However, I don't like the fact that you cannot discontinue a game when the person you are playing with does not play in a timely manner, even after being nudged several times.
B000FCK65W|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was absolutely amazing.  The story was so touching, and I was literally crying when the book came to an end.
B005LAIHVI|5.0|Belive it or not this movie made it to number 1 at the boxoffice. and i can see why, it was a awesome movie, a little twist to the story but thats okay sometimes you got to spice things up. i thought that the story was pretty good. and the actors did a good job. i did like how they did the giants they looked cool. all in all it was a good movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B008MEM24S|5.0|Just challenging enough and my 4 year old absolutely loves it. Thank you for a great product! Definitely would recommend
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The story was great. I loved everything about it. It's a great love story and definite a must read. Can't wait to see the movie.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Liked until it updated itself<br /><br />Now when I open the app a box pops up that says in blue letters &quot;fake welcome screen&quot;  please get this fixed my little cousin loves this game and is very upset she can't play it anymore
B008QE9XD2|5.0|This is a awesome movie. i didn't even know that this movie was based on a tv show. now i have to see the tv show. johnny depp did a good job playing a 16th century vampire in a 20th century world. actually all the cast did a great job. what can i say. tim burton films are great. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B000F8O35U|5.0|The chain stores quit carrying this and my Granddaughters just had to have it for Christmas . I was so glad to get it an dso very fast !
B002QRWJA4|4.0|Good rendition but I think they could have done better. It didn't seem the actors were actually singing and you could totally tell they were lip syncing!
B00514HDNW|5.0|I thought this would be an in depth version of the movie. Boy was I surprised. Once I was able to push my brain past the movie I found that I deeply enjoyed the book. A lot more thei thought I would. I cannot say that the book is better then the movie, in this instance they are so different they should be considered two different entities.
B008220BLG|5.0|This movie was actually good. it had a good storyline and great actors. me and a friend from work went and saw it. he chose the movie. glad he did. the best way to describe this film is imagine romeo and juliet meets dawn of the dead with no or hrdly any gore. all in all it was a good romance movie and it was funny to. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B00AECGQF2|3.0|I love this app but after the first day I could not open it on my kindle fire hd , I paid two dollars for this come on now really
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Bought it for my son.....HE LOVES IT...  Awesome talk piece.... every one likes it and it does exactly what it said it would do
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Andy Weir spins a compelling look at how a man copes with being left behind on Mars.  This book is well written and has a great plot.  The main character is interesting. His problem solving is fascinating.
B0034JGBM0|3.0|I love the White Stripes and love them more live, but I am so sad to say this is not great. A lot of the songs aren't good and his vocals aren't very good on certain songs. Definitely only buy a few songs. Buy Jolene, Seven Nation Army, Lets Shake Hands and Union Forever those are the best. Then the other good ones are 300mph outpour blues, Icky Thump, Blue Orchid(worn out vocals), Ball and a Biscuit(very different and short but still pretty cool) and When I Here My Name. Maybe buy Fell In love With A Girl(different sounding its slower) and all the others are just throw outs. I love every song the WS have made and some how I can easily say I regret owning some of the songs on this album which is pretty rare for me. This is kind of a 2/5 album but they're my favorite band so they get a 3/5. What a let down.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Kingdoms and Lords was my very first game that I got when I purchased my Kindle Fire.  The graphics are amazing, the battle system, quests, and city building is epic...I really like the fact that you are not required to use gems or have neighbors to expand your land.  If you are a fan of games where you can build your own city, do quests then this is for you.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys this type of genre...even if you are new to these types of games.  You can add me I am on all the time.  My gameloft ID is Kryptonian7.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I only gave this movie three stars because its overall storyline and content isn't really my cup of tea.  However, I must give them props for the cg effects.  The shots with the bear were very realistic and the story line flowed.  While we found ourselves laughing at numerous parts other parts were pretty ribald.  This is NOT an appropriate movie for kids nor for adults who dislike strong language, sexual content or substance use within their movies.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was truly amazing. But the true Hero to me will always be Percy Jackson. I like Jason and all but to me the reason the quest went so far was because of Percy and Annabeth. Again no hate towards Jason ~ [review by RainbowAligale01]
B00064AM6C|5.0|This is a MUST for any White Stripes fan. If you don't like this then you're missing out on some big chunks of who the White Stripes are. This blows Under Great White Northern Lights completely out of the water then blows it up again once it's out of the water. So I'd definitely recommend this, actually I'd demand this. They are in their prime here.
030746363X|5.0|I have yet to read this book.....hope my bestie shares. Want to see how it works...am always searching for a edge to keep the weight at bay.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Very nice story line with great effects.  The movie was shipped out in a very timely manner especially considering we ordered it right before christmas.  The dvd's were in great shape and no damage was done to the packaging.  The movie is about two fairies who accidentally find out they have a sister who has been sent to live in a different season then themselves. Very kid friendly
B0010SKTRA|3.0|The book was interesting and compelling at times - it's wonderful to learn about onself and the human race.  However, the book club ladies overwhemingly commented they skipped over sections that seemed Greek to them or were just technical and boring.  I beleive they were felling closer to their reptilian origins at those points.
B002KGKH5A|3.0|I am a huge fan of the White Stripes. Before this came out I only knew about a rare live performance DVD of the WS, which was a full concert in Blackpool England. I saw it on TV once and I fell in love with it. Then I went on youtube to watch more of them live and they were awesome. Years later this DVD comes out and I get it thinking how can I go wrong it's the WS live. It starts out great, very interesting and then it combines interviews with snip its of live performances. As much as I like them I could kinda care less, I just wanted a full blown live performance of them. THIS IS NOT THAT. This is kinda like a documentary(I already know stuff about the white stripes why would I want to watch this). So after watching it and being some what moved, I was very disappointed and wanted the real deal. So I went on Amazon and bought Under Blackpool Lights. Way better and totally worth it. I hugely suggest this over Under Great White Northern Lights. They are in their prime then (2005ish) and here you can hear his voice wearing down and its just not the same. I'd really rate this a 2/5 but since they're my favorite I give it a 3/5, but it's a perfectly done documentary that truly gets a 5/5 for being a documentary. Very well done but not want I wanted.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Clint is a favorite in this house.  Was pleased that it arrived in time for Christmas giving.  Hubby loved it....alot!.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I have been playing this game for only two week and I am really enjoying it. I have to think just enough to relax my mind of any problems that may be going on around me.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I would recommend it however, not sure I liked quite as much as her others, so four stars instead of five, it is good though!!
B008CX2A2I|5.0|Not sure what to say about this.<br /><br />It does what is supposed to do. Connect it to the AVR and voila, you have bluetooth.<br /><br />Bummer that my brand new Onkyo TX-NR717 doesn't come with bluetooth but it doesn't affect a review of the adapter.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I don't know how the writers do it but this is by far the best season out of the six.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|It doesn't get any creepier than this. The story twists and turns in addition to the excellent acting just make for great entertainment!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well what can I say.  This game is GREAT!!!!!!! I fell sorry for people who won't buy it. On a scale of 1to10 I give it a 100!!!!!!!!
B000A6T1JU|5.0|This was a great find!<br /><br />Thanks so very much!  My husband was so thrilled to receive this as a gift!<br /><br />Terrific purchase!
B0076DELIG|3.0|I always enjoy Connelly's work but found The Black Box a bit predictable and slow moving. Harry Bosch seems old and tired and his boss, Lt. O'Toole, is such an idiot that he is almost a characature of the worst sort of bureaucrat.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Creepy, suspenseful, great cast, great acting, great writing, great visual effects...there's just not much more a viewer could hope or ask for, except...more, please!
B001FB4W0W|3.0|Am I glad I ordered this?...The verdict is still out. Would I order it again?...Probably not. I got a good bargain for the price, but I simply lost interest in the series. It seemed to get &#34;cheesier&#34; as it progressed. Now I don't watch it anymore- at all.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|This is such an incredibly adorable Disney classic.<br /><br />Ho very happy to have found it.<br /><br />What a perfect purchase!  THANK YOU!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game for myself, but I also think it's great for all ages, it teaches hand-eye coordination. Awesome!
0879309210|5.0|Knowing your guitar well will certainly lead to playing well!<br />This is a book for acoustic & electric guitar! The bible of all guitar maintenance books!!<br />Easy to read + follow, requires very little study before you start! Basically read as you go!
B006YXTRHY|4.0|I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would.  So much so, that I had to watch the first one again.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|This book was really just ok...i dont know if it was because it was based in another country and there vocabulary is a bit different...but i read it in one sitting and i was happy she overcame her issues...
B0070Y46UY|3.0|While it surely is not a bad book, it's story is average at best.<br />I am not sad I spent the time to read it, but wish I read something else.
B008QMMEOE|3.0|my it would be better if you could up the puzzle piece amount. but the pictures are fun. my 3 year old likes it.
B008TTPQXA|3.0|This was a good book, except that there was too many times that it repeated itself.  I would have liked a little more originality.
B000TGGJKK|5.0|I am not big into these types of movies but my husband is so i purchased it and watched it with him oh it was well worth it to one reason i dont really care for these types is the way they tell these older stories is very hard for me to follow not only was this very easy for me to follow it kept my interest through out the entire movie
B000093OU8|5.0|This is my favourite Gary Moore CD, I have loved the &#34;back to the roots&#34; style Gary has produced it makes me proud of my part Irish ancestry, and was absolutely thrilled to hear and have, his version of &#34;Friday on My Mind&#34; which I think is best.  After being brought up on The Easybeats (out of Australia) version which was always my mantra as a music, dancing, mad teenager to hear Gary's rockier version is brilliant.  As a fan of Phil Lynott (R.I.P) its great to hear Gary's &#34;Johnny Boy&#34; which is a beautiful piece and at the end you get &#34;Out In the Fields&#34; so its bliss!!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I bought this.  My young kids always ask for new games, and this was featured at 99 cents.  We love it!  It's colorful, challenging and slightly addictive.  My husband and I like to challenge each other, and my three-year-old is good at it, too!  One thing:  we usually turn off the volume, as the music is monotonous.
1601254679|5.0|I bought this expecting an update of the tried and true rogues gallery, but what I received was very much more.<br /><br />There are four primary sections: Core Classes, Prestige Classes, NPC Classes, and Iconic Characters. Each section presents NPCs of various CR, all the better to provide you with excellent fodder for every conceivable encounter.<br /><br />Every page of the book presents not just an NPC, but more importantly a fully detailed scetch of their class for easy replication and deployment. This makes the book doubly useful as reference and inspiration for GMs and players alike.<br /><br />The art and print quality are typical to Paizo standards, which is to say outstanding.
0767817478|2.0|I PERSONALLY LIKE THE OLD ORIGINAL ONE THAT CAME OUT FIRST MANY MANY YEARS AGO THIS ONE HAD ACTION IN IT
B000FA675C|5.0|Everyone read this years ago, but I just got around to it - loved every page! Good character development and super story!
1439152802|4.0|I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out.  I was getting a little frustrated with Kate Morton toward the end of this book...I couldn't figure out what she was doing to her story, I thought she was ruining it.  I just couldn't see how she could possibly create a satisfactory ending for these characters...But she did!<br /><br />I listened to the audio book and enjoyed Caroline Lee's reading/acting very much.  As always I can accept unlikely events more readily when I hear them versus when I read them with my own eyes (and there are a few).<br /><br />I will agree with reviewers when they say this could have benefited from some more editing, a tighter story would have made a better story in my opinion.  But it was still a good story.<br /><br />I've listened to the audio versions of Kate Morton's last three novels and I think that listening to them has given me more enjoyment than I would have had if I had read them myself.  I recommended the audio versions with Caroline Lee reading, she is very good.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Star studded cast with lots of good voice acting by veteran voices you know. Jokes are pretty good througout and enough to keep both kids and adults entertained for an hour and a half. One of those movies where your kids will want to watch it over and over and over and over and.....
B002VPE1AW|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS VERY WELL PLANNED FROM START TO FINISH I MEAN IT HAD EVERYTHING IT HAD AWESOME COLOR AND GRAPHICS
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app so much I try as hard awning can to get on everyday... this app has great picture, quality, and puts u in real life situations of you have a horse. this app is very amusing and great if you are trying to kill time. GET THIS APP YOU WOMT REGRET IT!!! :)
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I loved this book!!  I learned a lot and it truly touched my heart, especially since learning right before I read it the heartbreaking news of how his life was taken once home.  He was a true hero and an example of what a true American is.  I couldn't put the book down and I recommend it for anyone who loves a true American story.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Gotta love Tim Burton. Great story though predictable. Provides a good moral lesson for the kids at the end of the movie which seems to be asking a lot out of kid movies/tv shows these days. Whatever happened to &#34;the more you know&#34; *sigh
B00003CX9Q|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS A VERY CUTE HEARTFELT WRITTEN STORY IT HAS LIGHT ACTION IN IT AND IT HAS ITS TEAR JERKING MOMENTS
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book. Not only did I love it while reading it, but even better was discussing it after I had finished. Not your typical love story.
0399160450|4.0|I was put off by Locked On -- the juvenile writing style and the too- quick plot resolutions left me wondering what had happened to the Real Tom Clancy, the guy who gave us &#34;Red October&#34; and &#34;Without Remorse&#34; among others. This time, it seems that T.C. has possibly heard the critics and learned a lesson as the writing is crisper, the action flows smoother, and the storyline -- the Chinese cyber threat -- is so current that one wonders if he has a mole in NSA or CIA. &#34;I couldn't put it down&#34; is a common cliche, but I really did find it hard to stop reading and do my other work. The only small nitpick I really have is a glaring error about the storied USMC boot camp Parris Island. Tom ( or that unnecessary co - author Greany ) wrote it as &#34;Paris Island&#34;. Any Marine reading that is probably fuming. Other than that, it seems that Clancy might be back -- or at least on the way.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|very good product we play hower of houer so its olsa for adults  i recomend also for child its a wonderfol idea
6305428387|5.0|THE STORY THAT WAS WRITTEN FOR THIS MOVIE WAS AND AWESOME AND FUNNY AND A TEAR JERKER IT HAD ACTION TO
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|good game. keeps u entertained. love love love it. i like to play this game when i have lots of time to kill and its free.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I am brand new to True Blood, and can't believe I missed out on such a provocative show. I loved how gritty and dark the vampires are portrayed in this series. Also, the story lines for the main characters are complex enough to hold my interest - a must. Overall, I loved it. (Wish there was less profanity...but they are vampires.) I've already started Season 2.
1936608898|5.0|Anyone considering the Whole30 needs to read this book.  The information is amazing and easy to understand.  Love the sense of humor throughout!
0767827716|5.0|THE ACTION FOR THIS MOVIE IS SLOW PACED BUT GOOD THE STORY THAT WAS WRITTEN FOR THIS MOVIES WAS WELL THOUGHT ABOUT
B000056QE5|4.0|Just what I ordered.  I had been looking for some of these songs for a fund raiser and this filled the bill.
B00B2LRK7W|5.0|Just like the title of my review says. This is Hatebreed. Old school, hard, fast and in your face music. I have been a fan since 1998 and their music never dissapoints me. This album especially, it gets in your face from the first track. I honestly like every track on this album, but if I had to pick a few favorites they would be: Honor Never Dies, Before The Fight Ends You and The Divinity Of Purpose. Those tracks just seem the hardest to me. But this whole album is solid from start to finish. A must buy for any Hatebreed or heavy metal fan.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fun just like the movie. I like the smugglers plane. Love the picture of the giant Jesus. And the orange slices.
B002BWP49M|3.0|THIS PART OF TWILGHT CONTINUED ON WITH THE STORY IT WAS PRETTY GOOD NOT ALOT OF ACTION EITHER IN IT
B0018O4YT0|5.0|I currently own the DC version of this movie, but on finding out that my bf was in love with this film - and couldn't remember the name to save his life - I knew it would make the perfect Christmas gift. I used to be on the fence about DC versions of any movie until I understood them. The DC version is the version the director actually intends the audience to see. It's his/her vision.<br /><br />Even though my bf has yet to receive this gift, I'm quite positive he will love it just as much as I love my copy. So, I've given it 5:5 because, 1) it's a great film and 2) I know he's going to like it... because it's the best possible version of the film.<br /><br />It arrived faster than I expected it to, still in its original packaging, and in great condition. No problem with this seller at all!
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Denzel Washington did an excellance job again. This is a movie about drug ,alcohol abuse and the effects on the family members and others. He tried to kick out his habits but failed. His family left him and his son avoid seeing him too.<br />During the enquiry he did not admit on the drugs and alcohol abuse until he was questioned on whether one of the dead filght attendants was taking drug and alcohol that day. He felt a sence of gulit and he finally told the true that he was drank and on drugs for the past three days including actual day. He told the members that he cannot tell another lie again. He was jailed and and unlikely to fly again. He said that he finally felt free even he was in jail. Free from lies and also kicking out the habit. his family members begining to accept him again and his son came to visit him. Good ending.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book because of the suspense and the feeling that had u almost fall out of your seat. I chose this rating because of those things that I have told u about.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|THE COLOR QAULITY & DEPTH OF THESE MOVIES WAS GREAT THE STORY LINE FOR THESE MOVIES WAS OVERALL GREAT AND FUNNY
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I bought this for my nephew who is &#34;5&#34; and he loved it.  He plays my Kindle and loves it.
B004CJB0CM|4.0|the only reason I do not give her 5 stars is because it kicks my butt so bad lol. Make it happen and she will show you the way
B005ETA5K2|4.0|just got this the other day and its a pretty nice device.  Much more powerful than the AWUS036H that i bought about two years ago.  Only this im having trouble with is WICD in BackTrack 5 R3 its giving me a bad password error when i try to connect to a wireless connection.  It also feels a little more durable than the 036H also.  The connector broke on the motherboard on the 036H so this was my reason for making this purchase.  But it definitely pics up more signals so its stronger.  Worth the purchase.
B000683VI4|1.0|THIS MOVIE WAS SO BORING IT PUT ME TO SLEEP THERE WAS NO ACTION IN THIS MOVIE IT WAS A DUD
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game was purchased for my 14 year old son, after a few weeks he is now a Minecraft most awesome builder! If you could give it more stars- he would!!! He now has the version that goes on PC as well, and bought a Minecraft T-shirt! Lego is now doing some cross promotion with these people which is a perfect fit. So the bottom line is, if your child, or child at heart love Lego, buy them Minecraft!! The Pocket edition works on Phones and Tablets and is $7 bucks. The PC edition is $27 bucks...and was still worth every penny.<br />Enjoy.<br />JB
1616550414|5.0|Looks amazing. Came in great condition. Absolutely great for any fan. I have no complaints on it. Arrived in time and unharmed.
0525478817|5.0|I found this to be a beautiful book.  You already know it is about teenagers with cancer so if that bothers you, don't read it.  The book does exactly what the author intended, which is to make it about the teenagers, not the cancer.  They come alive as regular kids (well, exceptional kids)who happen to have cancer.  It's not about fighting the disease, it's about them.  I am an adult so don't let the fact that it is YA deter you.  I often judge a book by how much I think about it after I finish it, and I think about this one a lot.
B00004TJKI|3.0|This seemed like a long movie ... I wanted to get to the end much quicker than it did; however, the movie is good and James Stewart is good as always.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is a great game! Go get it!The only thing I don't like is the price.When I got this game it was 3 $ ' s.And now it is only 2$'s.But this game has 6 cool characters.So I recomend to all ages its a great game!Yet again this is one of the only good hair game out their!HOPE YOU LIKE IT!-CECE
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Set in the early 1900's England, this show will keep you coming back for more!  If you like the time period and enjoy shows with many interpersonal issues, this is for you.  The dynamics between the &#34;royalty&#34; and the servents each carry drama of their own. I am looking forward to season 4!  Highly recommend this show!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the absolutely best books on manned space flight in our time.  I don't know bow the author thought all this up.  But he has one wicked imagination.  SPOT ON technical accuracy and the dialogue/monologue was perfect.
B002NZK5RI|5.0|I liked this movie when I saw it after it first came out.  The actors are exceptional.  I will not tire of watching this movie.
B001CZJKS0|5.0|Product was as pictured, order arrived before expected date and very satisfied with my order. A must have for all fans!
B000U6BT40|4.0|Eureka episodes get better and better as you watch and as characters develop.  It is a fun Sci-fi show-not too serious though, mostly fun and light-at least so far!  Some references to Warehouse 13, so there is a little cross over.  Give it a shot, I think you will like it!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Its okay. A little bid technical. But is vey good expleinig the last mission. I admire those guys and his lave for the USA.
B00005S6K8|4.0|Very entertaining and the actors did a good job.  The movie takes the audience on an emotional rollercoaster and is very enjoyable.  Worth watching again.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|Boo. Not happy with this game it gets stuck in a loop no way out and can't finish game. Hacks
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Season two was even better than season one!  This is definitely one of my favorite shows right now.  Owning it was a no-brainer, I definitely recommend this to anyone that likes GoT.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I am a huge Grisham fan. I devoured his early books in high school, and they were instrumental in my decision to move to the US. While his recent books are not as great as the earlier ones, they were enjoyable to read nonetheless.<br /><br />The Racketeer on the other hand was so far fetched, that in the after word he states that the &#34;lazy writer did not research anything&#34;. Perhaps that was in jest, but it definitely shows. At the end of the book, I definitely felt I was 'had' and the after word only reinforced that feeling.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I thought the movie itself was very good.  This is real science FICTION!  I like things like Star Trek also, but that is more like future science projection or things that possibly could one day come to pass.  I consider &#34;The Fifth Element&#34; to be science fiction.  I also give it 5 stars for the service I got from the seller and accuracy of the discription.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Like many others before me, I have succumbed to the lure of the &#34;Outlander&#34; series.  For years, a member of my family urged me to read these books, and I resisted.  When I finally read &#34;Outlander,&#34; I was hooked, and am now reading &#34;Voyager.&#34;  It certainly meets all my expectations for engrossing reading, and I highly recommend it to anyone.  The characters seem quite real and it is easy to feel that one knows them.  It is a wonderful blend of science fiction (time travel), history, and romance.  It was the &#34;romance&#34; part that put me off at first, but it is easy to accept in the context of the story.  I look forward to reading the rest of the &#34;Outlander&#34; books and others that Diana Gibaldon has written.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I love Game of Thrones, so the idea of not owning this was out of the question.  Being able to watch GoT on my Kindle Fire and/or my phone is awesome!
0618680004|4.0|I enjoyed the sometimes contraversial statements in the book.  It makes for great discissions with friends.  Be prepared for arguments!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Good movie with a good premise.  It left me wanting more to see where it all began.  I guess time will tell.  The shipper did a good job.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I admit I'm late to the Macklemore fan club. Thrift Shop was the first song I'd heard, so I decided to take a chance on buying the album. Although the songs are different in style from Thrift Shop, they're all just as awesome. I can honestly say I love every song on this album, which rarely happens. I hope these guys shoot straight to the top; they deserve it.
B0009UC810|5.0|A great tribute to a movie classic, this is a wonderful addition to my movie collection. Long live Elwood and Jake Blues!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book my favorite book ever by far. It was the best book ever. Can't wait for the movie.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|This was an outstanding TV show that, much like many other shows that year, had its first season cut short and damaged by the TV Writers' Strike.  Even so, it still brought Terminator to the small screen in a big way with new characters and a new direction for the Termiantor universe.  A must-watch for any fans of Terminator or Sci-Fi in general!
1426209584|5.0|What more is there to say? The book is everything I expected from the preview on the National Geographic website.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It is no wonder that this movie was chosen as the best of the best. Highly recommended, full of action and suspense.
B0081336FO|5.0|This show is not only captivating but also hilarious. The only thing I don't like about this show is that there are only 3 episodes a season! I can't wait!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|fun a little addicting but is going to be a classic some day. anyone can play and I think everyone does
B007HACDLK|4.0|I Love Vince Flynn's Book. However, I<br />Don't believe this is as captivating as his<br />earlier Stories.  He is a Great Author of this<br />Genre.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The brothers are at it again, and I couldn't be happier.  This show has not ever disappointed me and I don't think it will.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This is a real Movie. the subject matter may not be for the closed minded or the young. This is a movie about a real man that has real problems.The kind of problems people sometime want to pretend do not exist. There is a lot of action some nudity, but only as it fits the story line. This is for the young adult or older I feel. This movie has a lot of mature story line. I enjoyed it and was moved by the ending. I think you should watch this with an open mind.
B005HSL626|5.0|my daughter loves the game even her grand father plays. keeps her busy on long drives. she is not much of a game player.
1594135851|5.0|I ordered this entire series of books because my stepdad let me borrow his copy of Hunger Games and it was great.  Of the 3, this is my 2nd favorite.  I was not a big fan of #2.  I am excited to see the movies when they come out (although I know they won't be as good as the books).  I can't remember the last book I have read before these because I'm not much of a reader.  These books are very easy to read and held my attention for the most part.  I read all 3 of them in no time.
B000TU16GS|4.0|This is the best book that I have ever read it is a draw dropping and it is very exciting  and you never know what is coming  READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app.  It is so peaceful.  I find it especially helpful during episodes of anxiety and panic attacks.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|I have been waiting for an android app a long time.I am so happy that it is finally here!!! If you love music, you have to get this app. There is so much variety, anybody can find their favorite tunes. I absolutely LOVE it. Thank you!!!
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Using this to connect my 27&#34; iMac to my G-Drive 4 TB and it works perfectly. My only concern is that it's 5&#34; long yet the flexible part of the chord is only about 1.5&#34; and I wonder whether over time that will cause it to break apart the way many of my other Mac chords have. Still giving it 5 stars because that hasn't happened in the few months I've had it, but I'll amend my review in the future if anything happens.
B000002GC2|5.0|I've owned this before and always want it as part of my music library.  A great compilation by the master, Quincy Jones.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great because it tells you the information in language most can understand. Need to know how much battery is needed for an online video? This is the place to check.
B009X00E18|2.0|Waited a while to write this because the light weight is good and the snap in hard back feels secure as a pro.  But there are a bunch of cons.  This particular cover is very light -- but I found that the feel is very cheap -- the edges feel sharp when they rub against you, and the matte black plastic on front is very prone to showing smudges and dirt.  The other con is that the groove in the middle of the back where you are to tuck in the lid to make it stand is fussy to use.  I find it impossible to tuck in securely without a lot of fuss, and it often falls down with a nudge soon after.  I much prefer this other case [[ASIN:B009X0167Y Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\", Black]] which feels better in the hand and stands up better for video viewing.  Both of these cases only stand in horizontal format, so are not much use for cookbooks.
B004GCPJDQ|4.0|I made to read other reviewers before installing the batter in my mouse, specifically the ones that had no problem with fit, despite all that I still had trouble getting mine to fit smoothly. I posted a picture of how the improper fit caused some strange wear on the bottom, but that's the only thing that kept this from 5 stars; everything else was perfect. Sometimes I forget to charge it for days and I still haven't had it die.<br /><br />Pros: Charge lasts a while, Looks as sleek as any Apple product, Effective battery replacement<br />Cons: Fit isn't great (but doesn't affect performance at all), Improper fit causes wear on the battery (though only aesthetic)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show.  its so good.  very well acted, very well written.  i am addicted.  i have had some horrible tragedies in my life in the last few months and few years.  this show has allowed me to escape my present and forget my troubles for a while.
B004QL7K6Q|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time... I was surprised to see so many bad reviews. Some people just don't have a sense of humor apparently.
B000SW4DH6|5.0|Incredibly creative, with unexpected use of songs you know and may never have loved until now...definitely one of my all-time favorites.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I really loved this book definitely recommend it to any age group a lot of suspense and a lot of excitement in the book definitely buy and read this book
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This one of the most heartwarming and philosophical books I've had the pleasure to read.  If only we all had th  wisdom of enzo
B005723JSQ|5.0|I love the story....it's fun & truly is entertaining. Recommended to readers that may love something romantic & nerve wracking.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show never fails to make me laugh and this season is no different. I love, love, love Sheldon and how you never know what to expect from him.
B00AYF5SHQ|5.0|Five BRILLIANT Stars! The award-winning violin and piano virtuoso Julia Fischer's latest Decca release is a wonderful combination of Max Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 1 in G minor, Opus 26 and Antonín Dvořák's Violin Concerto in A minor, Opus 53 (B 108). With excellent support from the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra under the baton of maestro David Zinman, the violinist and orchestra are in superb form producing exceptional versions of this well-matched program of Romantic violin concerto works, both of whom were influenced by the input of violin virtuoso/composer Joseph Joachim. Fischer's inspired, fiery bow work produces a lyrical performance of Dvořák's awesome but under-appreciated 1883 concerto. This should elevate the popularity of that work immensely among violinists and classical fans, especially the spirited Allegro ma non troppo movement, with it's hauntingly beautiful themes, which proceeds seamlessly into the grand second movement. The more popular Bruch concerto is played with sheer brilliance by Fischer and the orchestra, especially the soaring Finale (allegro energico) movement, with its swirling 'Hungarian style' influences. This is a marvelous addition to the Julia Fischer discography linking the brilliance of these two celebrated Romantic composers and is further evidence of her place among the finest classical violinists. Bravo, Julia, David, and the ZTO! My Highest Recommendation. (Reviewed in MP3 format. 6 tracks: Time: 56:20.)
B003QS9WIE|5.0|Directed by Christopher Nolan, it includes great story telling, great characters, great twists... but it's a bit dark. See if you can figure it out as it quickly moves.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A game that is out of this world. One of the best  games i have ever played. I recommend that you should play it.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Enjoy it.  Very much like the ones before. Just a good face pace action movie with some nice set of looking good girl and bad girl.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|This and The Archandriod are the two best genre-breaking albums I've heard since Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Every song would be a favorite song on any other r&b album that has come out in the past 10 years
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|This movie could and should have been better. If you like superhero movies this idea warms your day-dreaming of yourself as a superhero soul. To instantly discover you have powers and there is a greater significance is every boys dream at one point. With that said, all the movies I've seen who attempt to pull this off have failed. I still enjoy them, but always leave wanting a little more.
1616550414|5.0|This is an amazing purchase, and I would recommend it to any Zelda lover, or as a gift for a Zelda lover.
B000I62JAK|5.0|This movie is HILLARIOUS and I think every comedy fan should see it! I have seen it so many times i basically have it memorized!
B004J4X32U|5.0|Dr. Siegel's work is invaluable here and will be able to help all of us parenting and working with children in truly understanding what they need and HOW to meet those needs.<br /><br />We should not be defaulting to medicating children for every little thing that goes wrong  at home or at school. Medication  is a tool to be used when appropriately needed. Dr. Siegel's book provides a framework to better identify issues and then implement more effective interventions. This book is well written in very accessible language, too.
B001NLKT60|5.0|enjoyed the trilogy it was hard to put the books down, I love it when you can't wait to get back to the next page
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is a wonder PBS series about an English Lord & Lady and their servants in the early 1900s.  You really should see Season 1 & 2 first. Lord Grantham has 3 daughters and no heir to his estate.  It also gets you involved in the servants' lives as well.  Very well written and the acting is superb.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I love Flipboard...it's a great way to access your favorite content in a clever, easy-to-read format. Twitter, Facebook, and other websites from around the web are presented in magazine-like format, organized into content categories. There's so much to discover and the visuals are stunning. Highly recommended!
B00BN4URSW|4.0|Action packed, suspense thriller.  Tom Cruise and Jamie Fox really showed their talent.<br />Jade Picket Smith had small part, but had a large impact.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|got this for my husband as a gift we have it on VHS but it was time to upgrade he loves it
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I would definetly reccomend this album if you like other Muse songs.  If you are just getting into this group you should by this and then you will absolutely want to get the entire collection.  I think there may have been one song that wasn't my favorite but was still good so I don't skip it when listening.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|I wanted to like this movie.<br /><br />It has fine actors and a superb director.<br /><br />But almost everything is wrong with it.<br /><br />It has no suspense, unscary monsters, a dull plotline, bad writing, and (I never thought I'd say this about Ridley Scott) lame direction.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender is well-cast as David, the android.  He has those plastic, not quite human, good looks.  But his acting is somnolent.  His monotone and expressionless face get irritating fast.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace is a victim of her makeup and the writing.  For some reason, somebody decided to put awkward, slightly shrunk, lipstick on her, making her look like a 3-year-old who got into mommy's stuff.  As for her character, it is stiff, one-dimensional, and not credible.<br /><br />Charlize Theron phones her part in.  She is supposed to play the unfeeling robotic Corporation woman, but she simply prances aggressively here and there and spouts badly written lines once in a while.<br /><br />The humanoid aliens, from the very first scene, are annoying.  They appear to be made of wax.  They move clumsily, and have sock-puppet expressions.<br /><br />Even the CGI in this movie is bad.  Perhaps they spent all their money on the big names, but the effects are impoverished and unreal.<br /><br />This movie could have been superb--an exciting, dark prequel to Alien.  Instead it is just a B- or C- or even D-movie.<br /><br />Too bad.
B00364K6YW|5.0|How can you not love this. I must have seen this a million times and it's still as good as the first time. A true masterpiece (and Mr. Darcy ain't bad to look at either).
B003Y059EK|3.0|This ain't your mama's Oz.<br /><br />This 1985 movie is MUCH darker. (Can we say electro-shock therapy?) The story and the acting are well done, but it gave BOTH of my kiddos (ages 6 and 11) nightmares. A decapitated woman who can switch heads at will is SO not good bedtime story material.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I got this amazing Christmas CD for a great price and love it.  I would recommend it to anyone especially good for background music in a business or at a party.
B005LAIISA|4.0|I loved the movie, it was funny.  Scrat is my favorite character.  If you like the Ice Age series of movies, I'm sure you'll like this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game. I have downloaded so many games that are just a waste of time but this game is different. Love it!
B004XZR63M|4.0|Not being a gung ho businessman type I still found it quite easy to go thru this financial book and follow everything...  kudos...  You can even find some common ground in some of the stories... Good read if you want to learn more financial strategies...
B009IK5UJ4|4.0|Perfect for after hours listening with a glass of red wine. Hats is truly a gem. Every song here is worthy of a single release. My only qualm with the label is why not more b-sides or the various single edits ? I'm sure there's enough room on 2cds for that.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I really like this movie.  It gets your attention and keeps it.  Denzel Washington is a good actor, I enjoy his movies.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Overall the acting in this movie is superb. It's Denzel Washington who sold this film in my mind. He is simply one of the best in the industry and to see him in a role like he was in this film remind me of how great of an actor he was. It is a must watch film if you are one of his fans like I am. The plot of this film was great one of the best that I have seen lately
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|With a camera for video calling, it should have had a camera app already installed. Just felt like I shouldn't have had to pay for an app that should have been installed already.
B00992CF6W|5.0|New update because I can't use tnt on creative mode but a great game if u could use tnt in creative mode
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This movie was in all aspects, amazing. I felt all the actors did an outstanding job in the roles in which they were cast. I bought the series and have watched it several times.  The movie has acheived near perfection in every way, save one glaring fact: the Marines who landed on Guadalcanal in August, 1942 were armed with the 1903 Springfield; old rifles left over from World War I, they were NOT armed with the 1903A3 Springfields as seen in the movie. Check it out.  They were not.<br />  Perhaps the 1903A3's were the only ones Hollywood could find enough of to arm the actors?
B00BHMF578|4.0|What makes this movie great is the fact that it actually happened, as your watching your like man I would never want to be in that position or captured...besides that not a big deal
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love being able to see the weather on the go and for traveling. Love being able to check weather when planning to travel.
B008FPOIT6|1.0|Not a good one. I bought it because it lured me with the mystery of an indie book store with 3-story shelves that disappear into the dark ceiling and an odd cast of characters desperately craving books at all hours of day and night. But the reality of the novel is disappointing at best.<br /><br />The promise of a good mystery is squandered on sci-fi BS. The deeper we get into the secret society that revolves around the mystery, the less interesting each new layer gets -- we go from a truly mysterious dusty bookstore, to a well-lit underground library with black-robed drone-like scholars. Both literally and figuratively. The pacing of the investigation into a 500 year riddle reminds of a tv show that has been canceled due to bad ratings -- first a slow creep with lots of filler, and then a sudden end that ties up all loose ends. The characters either don't grow, or almost entirely flip personalities, Care Bear style. I won't even get into all the technological BS that the author pulled out of thin air about what it's like to work, eat, and think at Google in Mountain View (the setting for half the story), because that's Dan Brown all over again (and not in a good way).<br /><br />Do not recommend.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|tempel run 2 is better than ever back in action there are caves ziplines and more its a great app. best one in the world!
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Prime membership definitely has its advantages.  Downloading the video is fast, and picture quality is awesome.  Even when video is stop and had to be resume, the quality is still excellent.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Biggest plus is being able to see as opposed to using my phone. Just like using my laptop more option then on my phone as well.
0345803507|2.0|Ok I will make it simple. I am not going to spoil the book for everyone who may actually like it. I had a friend ruin it for me and my rating is based on the fact that she put the book down from the start so much so that I really couldnt enjoy it. I will let everyone else form their own opinion.
B005K17RU0|4.0|accuweather is very easy to use and one of the best weather apps.  I use it along eith another app to keep up wiyh any baf weather coming our way.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This movie was a complete waste of celluloid.  I've never felt like ripping my eyes out after a movie before, but now I have.  Think of the worst movie you have seen to date.  Imagine it was three times as bad as it was and you have The Master.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Incredibly interesting...  Not that hard of a read, he explains all the big words in the book.  I appreciated that since some of them are medical lingo.  Incredibly interesting and I thought he was perhaps the right man for the job God had in mind for him.  Thanks for sharing your story, Eben!
B0096YJDNQ|5.0|Very simple to use and it covers all the basics. You can use it to learn the night sky and to locate common deep sky objects.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Yes, it's dark, but compelling.  Gillian Flynn has a wonderful gift of creating characters that are rich and frightening, and this book is no exception.
B004LE7PCM|5.0|This has by far become by favorite book. I love Sherlock Holmes and the original is for sure the best. Doyle's style of writing suits me very well. Love, love, love. This is a timeless classic.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|This Collector's Set came damaged. Discs skipped and cleaning them failed. I am so disappointed. I am hoping you will advise me on this matter.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Warning spoiler alert! Powerful. Made me wish I could do the same. Although without the drama and well, you know, dying.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very interesting surprising plot twists. I would definitely recommend reading this book. Amy and Nicks story will be timeless and I hope I never turn out this way
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best programs that I have seen since I can't remember when. Acting is suburb as is the story and scenery.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Love this series and cannot wait for season 4. Just wish they would cut back on the sex scenes for they ate overdone.
0743298020|5.0|Loved her style and the story.  It was very easy to get engrossed and hard to put the book down.
1936608618|5.0|This book is an excellent piece of information for building strength mobility and endurance. My wife is a personal trainer and refers to this book often.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best programs that I have seen since I can't remember when. Acting is suburb as is the story and scenery.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Very good and intense movie. Brings back some angry feelings. We live in a world of hate. But all in all it was a good movie.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|The interaction between the characters and the action are quite good.  You actually care about the characters, particularly hoping that the bad guys get their commuppance.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|Picture quality is good even though it was filmed in the 90's. I really hope Amazon gets more seasons because I'm loving this show!
B0000DD79B|5.0|This is the quintessential Simon & Garfunkel. They're my age--about 70--but they're timeless, as my disabled 48 year old daughter also grew up on them. And delivery, as always, was excellent. It arrived in pristine condition.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I've never been a big fan of big flashy box office movies, so I yawned when I first saw the trailer for this film. However my girlfriend is a HUGE Disney fan and literally has to see every Disney film in theater$. So we went to see this in theaters and expected nothing less than a waste of time and money. WOW! were we surprised. Despite all the negative review, and negative word of mouth, and even Disney's own negative feelings, this film is one of the best of it's release year, and in the end one of the top 50 Science Fiction films ever made. You really must see it for yourself. I sincerely hope the make a sequel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever downloaded, I would recommend it to all my friends! It is definitely worth the purchase.
B005PK56TA|3.0|This show had it's moments but was often repetitive. I was definitely startled in some scenes and the show is more suspenseful than full of guts and blood which is what I prefer.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love the way this show intertwines the fairy tales and reality!! Has become my favorite show on television! !
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Simply written, a simple story about the the most complex subject there is- life.And it's told beautifully. Stunning. I love it.
B009K72G8I|5.0|This season of the clone wars was epic! It had some of the most moving, intriguing episodes, my personal favorites being The Gathering (for going in depth into the making of a light-saber), Missing in Action (for the appearance of a Republic commando), The Lawless (for the nonstop action and a thrilling fight between Darth Sideous and Maul and Oppress), and The Wrong Jedi (for having the BEST story of all clone wars episodes and an incredibly emotional ending). My only complaint would be the episode A Sunny Day in the Void. This episode was nothing more than a fill in the blank. There was no story, no action, and to much unimportant dialog. Other than that, I would totally recommend this season to anyone who is a star wars fan.
B0043ZDFEQ|4.0|Some great hits plus some other hidden gems.  A great value at the download price.  A do recommend for bruno mars fan.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Best book I have read in the last year.  Did not want<br />it to end!  Reminder of the struggles before Lincoln<br />abolished slavery.
0307887960|4.0|It came on time and is in great shape. I look forward to reading and trying the diet and to losing weight.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|My CD player ate my AWAKE CD.  I was devastated.  I was able to find this CD at a reasonable price and was delighted to receive it in the mail.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|I loved the song Thrift Shop so I bought the album and I was blown away at the quality of music for so cheap! Some songs like Neon Cathedral and My Oh My are absolutely great! For $5 you can't beat that!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Oh, you can say the plot was predictable.  But the pros in this film did a great job of carrying it off.  I was biased going in because I loved the stars already.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All three books just blew my mind. I could NOT put my tablet down. The story couldn't have ended better if I had imagined up the ending myself. I can't wait for the movies ;-)
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Eventhough the movie came out before 3D was popular, the 3D adds a lot to the film.  I recommend adding it to your 3D collection.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This movie brought back old memories of a significant event in American/Iran history made possible by the declassification of the CIA operation.  The acting and characterization was great.  Was on the edge throughout much of the movie.  Highly recommend.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|A hilarious love story.  Even as the credits roll, I'm still laughing at the continuing story.  Lots of detail and the background music matched perfectly.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|My daughter and I love this app!  We love how easy it is to use and makes fractions fun and easy!
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I think this is an exciting movie, has a great beginning and keeps the attention through the whole movie, the ending is interesting as compared to the rest of the movie!!!
B006BXTOFC|4.0|I had bought Brothers quite awhile ago and loved it so I decided to check out El Camino and I certainly was not disappointed! It is an amazing album! A wonderful addition to any musical collection!
B000VNMMQQ|5.0|I liked the action.  Some of the scenes were far fetched, but I wasn't watching it to be educated.  I've seen it several times, and still enjoying it.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I have watched the tv show and now i am reading the books and I can see the difference.  But they are equally as good!
B004YEJGEO|1.0|I downloaded this game and an hour later it broke my phone. I Could not turn of my phone or anything. Tried reseting nothing. Took it to the store and nothing. This game sucks!
B009A9BEHU|5.0|Love Coldplay. What more could a person say. And this live version is a wonderful cd. Purchase it and see for yourself
B0002OERI0|5.0|I bought this CD for my son and he has been playing it over and over for the past two weeks.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I like the actor who plays Castle. First saw him on Firefly and he is even better in Castle.  Very good show

B004N44SOI|5.0|So I listened to &#34;The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack&#34; first and I thought &#34;This Is Gonna Hurt&#34; is not what I wanted after listening to the former. But after a while I found myself crazily in love with This Is Gonna Hurt. The feelings stirred up are stronger. The sounds are more velvet.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fabulous book with so many twists and turns. It was eventually clear where the story was going; however, it took a while and was not something you would figure out right away. Loved the suspense and the romance!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Encouraged by kids to watch this show. My wife and I started at season one and have really enjoyed the series
B004DLPXAO|1.0|My kindle started working very, very slow.  Then it suddenly froze and will not do anything!!!!  I am very upset that I wasted money buying this thing, because now all the books and games I bought are lost (or at least not available to me) :-(
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This my first try at a game like this and it was absolutely delightful! It is simple to play and keeps you hooked, wanting to battle more and more! The graphics and sound quality are awesome for a mobile game. I would recommend this to everyone.
0743270754|5.0|Passable history writing tells you the bare bones of what happened.  Above average history writing adds why to its story of what happened.  And great history makes you feel as if you were there watching it happen.<br /><br />With this book Doris Kearns Goodwin more than establishes herself among those ranks of the truly great among whom I would include contempories such as John Toland going all the way back to the early greats like Edward Gibbons.<br /><br />In my opinion her accomplishment is all the more impressive because of the age of the sources she's using.  Unlike for example Toland who was able to interview some of his main characters, Goodwin's account from the beginning was going to rise or fall with what she was going to be able to exhume from the written records.<br /><br />For those who've spent any considerable time reading 19th century correspondence it's not exactly scintillating writing.<br /><br />But in Goodwin's capable hand the otherwise two dimensional characters of William Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edwin Stanton and of course Abraham Lincoln jump off the page emerging as all too real three dimensional beings with their own strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />Like William Herndon's 19th century capable biography of Abraham Lincoln Goodwin did our 16th president the considerable favor of leaving him human which at one time allowed him to retain his weaknesses making his political accomplishments all the more lofty because they were done by a real living a breathing human being.<br /><br />For those who like this book and are interested in additional Lincoln reading I would suggest pretty much anything in Goodwin's notes with an emphasis on Herndon's biography and also the collaborative ten volume work by Nicolay and Hay (Lincoln's secretary's).  But if you're not among that group you will still find ample information about Lincoln and his cabinet in this wonderful book.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|one of my favorite movies I can watch over and over.  I passed the DVD around the family also !
B0077190MO|5.0|I got hooked right away.  Each character is uniquely their own.  The sub-plots keep you intrigued.  Watch out for O'Brian and Thomas!  The sinister duo.
0802473156|5.0|this was the first time I have read this author.  the book itself was easy to read and with a wipeable cover.  I will be sending to my daughter.
B002RIA00S|3.0|This book was recommended to me and it was quite good. I would give it probably a 5 out of ten.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The author took a situation that has been done before (2 strangers getting married after a night of drinking) and made it fresh. The amount of romance was just right. The intimate scenes were well written. The emotions of the characters were real. I'm glad it didn't take the turn I thought it would based on the premise for them getting married. Throwing a baby/pregnancy  into the mix of 2 people just getting to know each other wouldn't have allowed them to test their relationship and discover what they truly wanted. There could have been more character development, but feel that it didn't hinder the likability of the characters.<br /><br />I would certainly look for another Harlequin Kiss book as well as something else by this author.
0345803485|5.0|My wife couldn't read this one fast enough so she could get to the next ones in the series. I don't recall her reading any books this fast.

B00BLGZN1S|3.0|If you just enjoy shoot-'em-up combat scenes and a few inaccuracies won't bother you too much, COMPANY of HEROES definitely has its share (of both). Pretty good cinematography too: While it isn't the sort of film one normally watches for the lush scenery, there are some stunning shots of the Ardennes in winter.<br /><br />On the other hand:<br /><br />Lots of staid, corny, unrealistic dialogue (\\"Too much firepower--Move out, NOW!\\", etc). The premise of a ragtag group of Americans, Brits, and Russians sneaking into Stuttgart via railway in December, '44, in order to destroy the Germans' big new secret weapon is interesting. Alas, however, even though there are some complications here and there, this film makes it all look frightfully easy. Several bothersome inconsistencies such as Russian soldiers who just happen to speak perfect English and SS officers who alternate indifferently between German and English. The acting is mostly forgettable, though Neal McDonough, Alastair Mackenzie, and Melia Kreiling give pretty good performances. (Kreiling also strips briefly in order to spice things up.) The sheer number of characters, some of whom are completely unnecessary, adds a lot of confusion.<br /><br />All in all, a riveting but rather stupid war thriller.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Lots of repettion which was not needed, only for filling pages. I feel this book was overrated., you be the judge!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|My kindle has opened so many new experiences and this one is great. I wait impatiently for the next coin. I want more more more
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I like this show for the insight and the drama it shows.And for the real life that it brings.And it does show aome of the bad but some of the good too
B005IQZB14|3.0|Enjoyed it ,but it was a little draggy in parts and was disappointed that there wasn't more follow up on trailmates.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Engaging plot and characters. I can watch it all day. The 3rd season was not as good as the 1st two but i think it will rebound.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Who doesn't love Al Pachino? This is a classic. Great movie about drug transportation.  Kinda scary.  But great story line.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Season 6 of Stargate was a disappointment to some because we lose Daniel Jackson for a bit.  The stories continue to be strong, however.  Apparently our actor had a movie deal and left (mostly) for the year.  Still, he makes appearances (being ascended) from time to time and his replacement (an Alien with the ability to learn new things quickly) does a fine job.<br /><br />Really, the season barely misses a beat.  And while Season 9 and 10 changes our cast radically with RD Anderson leaving the main spot (don't consider any of this spoiler alerts since the show's logo include pictures of the actors involved each year), Season 6 maintains our other characters (as well as Daniel Jackson from time to time) so it gets 5 stars from me. Well done.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This story gets better with each word.  I can't wait to see where this love story goes. Do I hear wedding bells?
B003Y5H54W|4.0|The movie came very quickly through the mail and as soon as I got it, I popped it into my DVD recorder and started watching it, the director is the same one who did the first Twilight movie and it shows, Amanda Seyfried really shines through in her role as Valerie or Red Riding Hood the story was the dark version of the tale so anyone who knows this version shouldn't be surprised by what happens, Gary Oldman's performance as the priest really stood out and he is his usual cunning self.<br />If anything I didn't like it was the fact that nearly the whole movie takes place under the cover of darkness, even Twilight had scenes shot during the daytime, this a teenager type genre movie and it clearly shows from the audience it's appealing to as well as the movie being rated PG-13.<br />The picture and sound were really good as they should be with a DVD,<br />If your a fan of this movie then I'd also recommend you check out all five of the Twilight movies on DVD it is definitely worth your time despite Kristen Stewart's performance in the 1st movie.
B000646MNE|5.0|Awesome show.  I can see a little of me in each character. Great story of great friends.  And mr. Big......
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This show keeps you on the edge of your seat.  You never know what is around the corner. We are now into season 2.  Hope they keep making the show.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'm not a big reader,  but there was some suspense in wanting to know what Anastasia would decide to do.  Just read the book because my daughter was so into it.
B00B2064IY|5.0|If you love Jimi's music - you will love this album.  A welcome addition after soooo many years. The recording quality is top notch and I am very happy to recommend this to those who enjoy Jimi Hendrix's guitar and style.
B00122MWBK|5.0|I only wish it included &#34;Give a Little Bit&#34;.  Then it would be pretty much a perfect album, both for long-time devotees and casual fans who just want a bunch of their best tunes.
B00913DPW2|3.0|This is not so much a HO game but a brain teaser puzzle game.  Even with hints I required a walkthrough guide to solve some of the puzzles.  I would have appreciated a camera option or some way to write down the sequences or numbers you must remember for other parts of the puzzle.  All in all this game is not for the casual, fun gamer but those who need a real intellectual challenge along with their spookiness.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|A plain film, almost at the level of some crime channel re-enactment. It is simply incomprehensible how this can get any Oscar.<br />Syriana was much better.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I appreciated the story and graphics in this HO with minigames game.  Many of the puzzles were new (love the monkey!) and I enjoyed the progression of the difficulty.  Hidden objects were fairly easy to see and hint button is included.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Another book to help 50 somethings review their life choices and feel good or bad (or both) about them. If only I could get a twenty or thirty something to read it, I would be very interested in their viewpoint regarding the potential for guidance in their future life choices.
B009K0OL06|4.0|Great charactors to &#34;watch out for&#34; in this story.  At one point I truly could barely wait to see the following week.  But, overall it is very entertaining and good for temporary escape
B00ATPVA78|5.0|This game is amazing I love play when but I can't find the update to buy the rest of game.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|I love this disk. I found lots of great tracks on it that I like to listen to. I recommend it especially if you are a fan of Daft Punk.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|I have read the the Disney editions many times for my children since they were babies; now my eldest has reached an age which he can understand  and hold a deeper plot. I bought this book with the thought it might be a good idea to start with familiar story. After he reads his Level 1 book, I proceed to read this story to both of my children. Every night they look foward to this story. It has been a great success.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of the 9th Doctor but it is essential for hardcore fans to watch this from the beginning. I started the series on season 2 and am a huge David Tennant fan. The series has been excellent and is well worth the watch, millions of fans worldwide can't be wrong.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an awesome book! I have a new favorite author. Just don't use this book to assist you in going to sleep. It's not gonna happen!
B000ANDBTY|4.0|good service on time mailing plays good work well well well well well well well well well well well well
1449410243|5.0|My friend loved this book, which I purchased for her for Christmas!  We buy each other cat-related things all the time, so this was perfect.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Allows you to filter and look up review on the go. The app is especially useful when you are traveling.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Jeremy Renner is great and very believeable in this latest installment.  Fast paced and everything blows up.  Watch it, today.
B0092C2X7U|4.0|It is a back flip simulator. This app will take a little while to get used to and a long while to get good at. Because of this you will easily play long enough to justify the price.
B009AP2G26|5.0|Its simply a great show, its fun, you know the somgs and its easy entertainment.  between Darren Criss' singing and just everything Jane Lynch, its worth watching.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is great for working on spacial awareness or for killing time while you are waiting for a meeting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you havent discovered Downton Abbey then do yourself a favor and correct this error.  Great show, great characters and listen carefully because Maggie Smith's quips are outstanding and funny.
0547884591|5.0|If you are looking strictly for a cook book then this may not be the best choice for you. If you want a cookbook inside of a textbook that teaches you many other things then this is a great book for you. The author is a very good story teller and make you interested in subjects that you may not have even known you had an interest in. The book is a great value and I have been very happy with it.
B00005JM02|1.0|DVD is so scratched it doesn 't even play. very disappointed. My 2 year olds favorite movie and he cant even watch it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game alot I am happy that I found this game and my cousins also like it very much so thank you for making this game
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Great music.  Not just the hit song on the radio (Take a Walk) but all of the songs are great and have that unique style.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|An unfortunate experience happened to me and it was that i never got this package.  Although I am a big fan of this Star Wars saga I was never able to enjoy it bluray :o**(  I hope the person who got it at home and watched it enjoyed it as much as I would have.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|What an amazing piece of art by Muse.  They are definitely one of my favorite bands.  Nothing is better than a band that is continually creative AND amazing.  Sometimes creativity lacks quality.  But never from Muse, and The 2nd Law is as good as it gets.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|It brought back memories...I am a big fan of Final Fantasy video games especially Final Fantasy Seven.  Picture and sound are astounding.
B00488SU02|5.0|A must see I had to watch this online for a video analysis for class. I really enjoyed it. I could add this to my collection,
B008476HBM|5.0|One of my favorites, Love the book. Will read many, many times more. If you have never read this it is a MOST!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love! Just wish there were more free ones to play and more free variety since I cannot afford to buy them.
B00095NX9G|1.0|It cant play on gaming concels. Now i have to get a dvd player. :( Would be nice if the dvds where able to play on all systems.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|This is probably the best teen comedy of the 1980's. It jumps into all the big issues that teens in the 1980's faced. Of course, many of these issues are timeless and probably apply just as much today. All the five main characters are likable, and every actor portrays their character well. There is a person behind every stereotype, and _Breakfast Club_ does a great job at breaking through them.
0345803485|5.0|All I can say is wow!  Somehow, people made me think it was more darker than it really was.  From the beginning, I felt like it was a love story.  Even for my generation, it was kinky, but in a good way.  I could not put it down.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Using pinterest on my kindle fire was very hard to do on the Internet. This app is amazing! It made going on pinterest enjoyable again :)
0345803507|5.0|Now that I have read all three, I can't wait to see what the author comes out with next.  You truly believed that love can conquor all.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A beautiful, heartwarming story of two young adults braving cancer and its effects.  Just because something is not meant to last forever, isn't it still worth having for as long as possible?
0345803493|5.0|Very kinky, but thrilling at the same time.  Not sure if I liked the anger, but you began to understand where it was coming from.  Good read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love subway surfers because; 1.) They go on world tours 2.) They have new characters and hover boards for each tour, holiday etc. 3.) It's just plain addicting and NEVER will get old. Never.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app!  I can't have my own horse so this makes it seem like I have kind of a horse. It's so much fun and addictive. I could play it for hours!
1400069807|5.0|I learned a lot from this book, after anyone with a brain would suspect as much in that giant food manufacturers want to get us eating and yes hooked on their foods....it's called corporate profits....Doesn't mean these corporations care one bit about our health - only profits motivate the....only more & more profits motivate food corporation....We all should know by know the dangers of sugar - if not your have your head in the sand and want to believe it's just some giant liberal conspiracy...as for salt, one does need much to fulfill ones daily requirement,(which is a very small amount) yet is full of salt packed in all the process foods we buy - the book will tell you all you need to know about these ingredients food companies load their food with and how the food industry goes about hooking the unsuspected & the ignorant - this is not a book for the cons as they are already in sites like this trolling around to put down anything anti corporation.....Yes, they will lie and deceive for money....Just do you own research and you will see these troll clearly and everywhere all for profit......You wanting more accurate info isn't for monetary profit but for the real facts and the health and well being for yourself, and family 7 friends....This is truly an insightful, interesting book....You will recognize so much as you read about, basically deception for profits....Like corporations are above this?  - Get Real!
B002QGSYRC|5.0|This book reveals the military as well as the political aspect involved in the Korean War. The author adequately describes details to the exact detail and very well written
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The only \\"soap\\" type drama I've ever liked and the only one I watch.<br />Only con is the con.. not the acting, but this story line is terrible, painful to watch it's so bad - I use the this time for bathroom breaks.<br />Bring on Season 4!
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|All I can say is I enjoyed the movie. I'm no critic so I'm not going to be able to talk about emotionality, cinematography, or anything fancy like that. I watch movies for entertainment - I like the &#34;escape&#34; factor. I will say this - the movie was a little different than I was expecting - in a good way. Not as predictable as I feared it might be. Watch it!
B008VBYN80|5.0|This is completely awesome the only thing that's wrong is the diamonds. The items should be cheaper but it is a good game.
B002N1RM5A|5.0|I admit I'm a huge fan of Jonas Kaufmann, but those who know him from his Wagner operatic roles will get to hear a very different, more nuanced sound in this song cycle.  I think it's one of the best versions of this cycle out there.  At turns buttery, sinuous, and thrillingly full, this CD has it all.  It's really wonderful to hear a dramatic tenor do it and still have the chops to do what the range requires.  Wonderful!
B001ER4CNY|4.0|This was a great purchase,I love it. The only fault I have found is the case is flimsy and Brock after a month..
B00005LIN0|2.0|W e thougth we purchased a copy of the film with Henry Bollefante<br />unless we can preview we will not do any purchasing any more.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is one of the most looked forward to in our family.  The dynamics between the characters is fantastic.  It makes you think about what you would do and have to do in a situation such as these people.
B005MYEQ9U|5.0|My wife and I loved it start to finish.  i am more looking for previewing others sound was good and a bit of history
B0018RC7QE|2.0|Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro together in a film; it seemed so promising.  I was just dissapointed in the plot and the way the story flowed.  I believe in the commitment between a husband and a wife and these two characters so readily gave that up.
B0039HR5QS|4.0|This movie hasn't exactly aged well, particularly in the music department.  To be fair, though, the music in film should match the music of the time period, which it does, but it's just that they didn't choose the best music from the period.  (It's funny because, in my opinion, some of the best popular music ever produced was from the 70s.  A lot of the singer-songwriter stuff was really good, much better than the so-called &#34;music&#34; that's come out since 1990.  Don't get me started. . . .)<br /><br />Something else that I noticed while watching on March 5, 2013:  many of the actors in this film have died:  Cliff Robertson and John Houseman to name just a couple.  But luckily for us, actors such as Robert Redford, Faye Dunaway and even Max von Sydow are still around, and still producing some pretty good work.  And I've always been a really big fan of Mr. Redford's, so I always watch his films whenever I get the chance.<br /><br />I have to admit, this film came across as a little too conspiracy theory to me.  Naturally, in a political thriller, you need the &#34;good guys&#34; and you need the &#34;bad guys,&#34; and so the screenplay decided to use some of the people who were supposed to be &#34;good guys&#34; and made them the &#34;bad guys.&#34;  You always need conflict to make any film work, and so they had to go the conspiracy-theory route to achieve that conflict.  It could also be argued that they threw in the Redford-Dunaway matchup just because American audiences always seem to demand a love interest -- something that can really get in the way of good filmmaking, and it surely tries to do that here -- so that argument might be valid.  However, I do have to admit that there was some real chemistry between Ms. Dunaway and Mr. Redford.<br /><br />Still, a pretty good movie, minus perhaps for some of the music.  For me, more like a 3.5.  But I'll round up because of the outstanding cast.
B009L32R5I|4.0|The knack for the unlikely ... it is not an easy task to take classic Genesis Progressive music and re-record it ... the tendancy is either to totally rework these \\"masterpieces\\" as to annoy the true fans or to try and copy them so closely as to make the new work redundant.<br /><br />Enter Steve Hackett ... he has managed to faithfully keep the spirit of the originals but polish up the production to let these gems shine again and make them sound fresh (or timeless, whichever you prefer) ... doesn't hurt that he had a significant hand in the original recordings and knows how they should be presented ... sometimes it is easy to forget you are listening to re-recordings ... even the vocals have a classic Genesis flavor ...<br /><br />Steve has done a fantastic job with the arrangements and production but also with selecting the perfect musicians to make it all work ...<br /><br />I also like how he included a few tracks from his solo albums that were written and recorded about this same time in the Genesis history ... they fit nicely and would/could have been on a Genesis album anyway ...<br /><br />As a long-time Genesis/Hackett fan, this is one of the most satisfying albums of revisited Prog in a great while.  Although I like the first Genesis Revisted (Watcher of the Skies), this one surpasses that effort in my opinion ...<br /><br />Highly recommended to all Genesis fans as well as anyone who appreciates Classic 70's Progressive Rock.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|It was a funny romantic comedy. Felt a little lack of chemistry at some points but good movie all said and done.
B008220DIC|2.0|I thought the acting in this movie was really great, as was the subject matter. The 1950's era was also well-depicted. And having studied L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology extensively, I thought the protrayal of Lancaster Dodd and \\"The Cause\\" was spot on. Philip Seymour Hoffman as the Master with his arrogance, pretentiousness, and odd charisma seems to correlate well with the LRH that existed in real life. He even dresses and looks a bit like him.<br /><br />So to me, the subject matter was really interesting. The problem is, the movie went nowhere. The acting was excellent, yet the characters never grew or changed in any way. The Master was a static character who never changed. His wife started crazy and ended crazy.<br /><br />And Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie, the guy the movie is really about, goes nowhere. Unless you count going from crazy to crazier. There is no character arc in this movie. No one grows or changes in any way that we care about.<br /><br />Worst of all, the movie has no ending. It just stops. I prefer movies that actually have an ending. Even if I don't like the conclusion, I still prefer movies that have one. But this one has no ending or conclusion. The film just stops running, leaving you wondering, \\"What did I just watch? And why did I watch it?\\"<br /><br />The big reveal at the end of the movie proved to be false and hollow, intentionally so. I could accept this, if it made for some heartfelt change in our main character. But it changed nothing in him, so it was ultimately meaningless.<br /><br />This movie was well-crafted, but it made me feel empty and hollow. Unfortunately, this movie is a good allegory for Scientology itself. It sounds good, it looks good. But in the end, it's a bridge to nowhere.<br /><br />Still, I got to see boobies. So +1 star for that!
B008Y73940|5.0|Very good movie with enough twists and turns to keep you engrossed. This movie suited McConaughey and his smart Alec humor.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a fun game that lets you think you are running on trains and its fun to get a mistery box.
B00AYJCEYC|1.0|If Michael Bolton had been alive and famous in Florence during the early 14th Century, I'm sure that Dante Alighieri would have devoted a canto from Inferno specifically for him.  Egads.  Even Vanilla Fudge (yikes!) did a better (or more entertaining) cover of \\"You Keep Me Hanging On.\\"  The cottage industry of singers past their shelf-life expiration date doing Motown tribute albums (Michael McDonald, Phil Collins) has got to stop.  Please.  All of the original and quite unsurpassable versions of these songs can be found very easily, and if this collection steers people in that direction, then it at least will have made amends for its existence in the first place.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walking dead is the best show on tv, hands down.  It is a thriller no doubt, from start to finish.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Argo is an Excellent movie!  Best I've seen in a very long time. I highly recommend Argo for an afternoon of entertainment.

B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is one of our favorite shows.  There is plot line that weaves throughout each episode.  The characters are great and developed well.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I guess I love this series because it is so far away from my real life. The charactures are so well acted that they are beleivable,  you care about them as if they are real people.  I have cried over many episodes.  This show has become one of my favorites. I would recommend it to anyone who isn't easily offeneded
B001NESPHC|3.0|Vinyl - Very clean recording but fails to capture the acoustic. There is no air or space around performers. You know why? Because it was recorded in different places and painstakingly put together in mixers and machines. Dead as a blonde with great teeth. It sounds rolled off in the treble and bass enhanced. I played a 1966 Columbia recording of The Sound of Music after this. It blows this away. Through the crackles of 50 years, the life and vitality of vinyl shone capturing the raw emotion of the performance. None of that with Melody, I'm afraid.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wide range of reading plans and translations available. I am especially happy to see N.T. Wright as one of the teachers for Lenten seriers.

0062073192|5.0|A great look into the mind of John Winchester and how he came to be the Hunter that he was.
B005PK57NU|5.0|This is a great episode.  I bought just this one because my boyfriend makes an appearance in it in the swimming pool and it was filmed at his college.  All in all this is a great show though.
B00B0HXC4I|5.0|A tight metal band executes extremely catchy riffs while smooth strong vocals deliver dark messages. I've found myself listening to this work more and more, and humming the songs (especially &#34;Ritual) when not listening.
B008BTOVL6|1.0|Season 1,2, and 5 of this box set worked fine.  Seasons 3 and 4 did not work at all, even after cleaning my blu ray lens.  I contacted the company to see about getting a replacement for seasons 3 and 4.  Their advice to me literally was that my blu-ray player was at fault, even though the other seasons worked.  They further asserted that there was no possible way that faulty discs could have passed through their quality control.  With such an arrogant attitude, i believe i will now attempt to get a refund from the company, i literally own hundreds of blu-ray discs, and only 3 other titles have had problems, that roughly works out to about a 1% failure rate, so i'd have to say i'm 99% certain it's not my player.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|A must see movie.  An excellent cast and plot with twists and turns that you don't see coming.  It's been several days and I'm still thinking about how good The Lincoln Lawyer was.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|even though there's quite a bit of waiting in the game its a lot of fun, and I also like the fact that you earn those dollar things every time you level up.

B00AMBH70S|5.0|Ok, Matt Damon did so well in his role for the previous movies, I just knew he could not be matched. However, the movie was smart about what could be the most obvious flaw. This is another good movie. Very Entertaining.

B000Q76K1A|5.0|This whole series is wonderfu. There are no obvious flaws in the many turns  and twist of all of these movies. I tried to read the books, but the movies are more for me. Exciting fast, Matt Damon has this character down.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This was a fun game but then one day it said I needed to update so I did, now it won't work. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but when I click to open it it just takes me back to my kindle home screen.  This is getting really frustrating.  It worked until the update....
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Not  only is Daniel Craig the best Bond ever, this was my favorite Bond movie.  Great action sequence at the beginning and just goes on from there

B007I2BZIE|3.0|I've always been a pretty big Rush fan, but I was a bit disappointed in this CD on the first listen. I haven't listened to it again yet, so maybe it's one of those that gets better with age, but Geddy Lee's vocals just seemed old and tired to me. Instrumentally it was ok, although not outstanding, but the vocals just make it a weak effort.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I am not one to enjoy &#34;arcade style&#34; games, I usually like the kind where you build a town or other collection. However, this game is the single most addictive game that I've played to date. Graphics are gorgeous, characters are adorable, and there are many permutations that change the environment so the path to winning is gradual and rewarding. Well done, Liquid Entertainment!
1449410243|5.0|I'e already read this book twice.You ca not help laughing when you read it.The Oatmeal is the best thing on the web today and this book is right up there with his best.
0062014536|4.0|I enjoyed Delirium, was sickened by the cliffhanger ending that Oliver left us with in Pandemonium and found Hana fascinating. As you can imagine I was very anxious to step back into Oliver's final book of the series Requiem. Fans are either going to adore this one or loathe it. The author ends this series without a lot of closer. I thought it was perfect and if you read my reviews you already know I loathe endings forced into a happy little bow. Filled with battles, death, suspense and unrequited love I consumed this in a single day.<br /><br />The tale picks up where Pandemonium left off, and it took me a second to place all the faces. They are headed back into the Wilds and Alex is with them. Things are awkward, disorganized and there is tension. The tale is told from the points of view of Hana and Lena. As Hana moves towards her upcoming wedding and Lena and the resistance move towards a rebellion uprising. The tale that unfolds is packed with emotion, contemplation, heartbreak, mystery and fear.<br /><br />Lena has joined the resistance but struggles to commit, I felt if not for her loyalty to her new family in the Wilds, that she would have sat this whole thing out. She struggles with her feelings towards both Julian and Alex. She loved Alex, and losing him was so painful for her that she holds back. Julian is strong, heads into danger and wants Lena by his side. Alex has changed, and when confronted by Lena he holds back and doesn't open up. He is absent from most of the book leaving us without the epic love triangle I anticipated.  While he isn't present he is very much in Lena's thoughts. We see some really brave stances from some of the characters in the wild and I admired them and wished we knew more about them. Someone close to Lena reappears and guides her. Hana is really struggling; she worries the cure didn't work, she feels guilt over her betrayal and worries about her upcoming wedding. She questions what kind of man she is about to marry and we become caught up in her fears. His storyline made me shiver but Hana does a lot of brave things, and I liked the woman she is becoming.<br /><br />Chaos and war rules supreme in this final installment. The Wilds are no longer safe, and those who are uncured struggle with their daily existence. There is unrest and fear within the government cities and the more we learn about the mayor of Portland and his plans the greater our fear becomes. We get plenty of action and eye-opening moments.

The Wilds are no longer safe, and those who are uncured struggle with their daily existence. There is unrest and fear within the government cities and the more we learn about the mayor of Portland and his plans the greater our fear becomes. We get plenty of action and eye-opening moments.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|After season 2 i wasn't sure how I was going to feel about season 3, but they have stepped it up this season and this show has been incredible.  I can't wait to see what happens next.
1451695195|4.0|Hearing such a clear and definitive description of the afterlife from a scientist who has a lot to lose from his own skeptical  medical community, gives real credence to this book.  It gives me a sense of hope and peace for my loved ones who have passed on.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If you have already watched the first 2 seasons, you won't be disappointed.  There are ups and downs, and twists that will excite and upset you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is a very entertaining. it does lag sometimes but I think that is just my Internet. great game
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Suspenseful all the way to the end. The characters blend together seamlessly...  everyone wishes they'd have such good friends as Ethan does.
1597772992|5.0|This study contains extremely valuable information.  I have learned so much about diet, and how it is affecting my health and longevity.  The book/CD is highly informative and I believe everyone concerned about their health should read/listen.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The writing is superb. It sucks you in and plays with your emotions which is exactly what writing is supposed to do. The author is an artist.
0765325950|5.0|In 1990, Robert Jordan introduced readers to THE EYE OF THE WORLD, the first volume of The Wheel of Time. Within those pages lay the quest for the Dragon Reborn, the champion of Light who would fight to save the land from the Dark One, and the tale would grow into a fully-realized world embraced by tens of millions. Now, 23 years later and nearly six years after the death of its creator, the conclusion to the series is realized in the powerful 14th volume, A MEMORY OF LIGHT.<br />The long-awaited finale finds the forces of Light preparing for the Last Battle, but they are still splintered into self-serving factions, some retreating from losses and assaults by the growing might of the Dark One. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, has devised a scheme by which he would break the seals holding the Dark One imprisoned and kill him, forever ridding the world of malevolence. At the same time, he has crafted a peace accord for all of the kingdoms, insisting they sign the agreement in exchange for his confronting the Dark One --- an act that very likely will cost him his life. His ultimate goal is to leave a legacy of peace for all time.<br />Elayne is placed in charge of the overall command of Light, devising a strategy with the generals and warriors by which they can draw out the forces of Darkness and secure an easier passage for Rand and his role in the Last Battle. The difficulty lies with having to battle on three separate fronts, each necessary to win in order to secure the others. Failure in one could mean failure in all. As Rand makes his last-minute accords and pulls together the strings that would both bind the forces of Light as allies and wrap the noose around the Dark One, things start to waiver and the plans crafted to win the day falter. All will now ultimately rest with Rand and his success, but as he confronts the Dark One, he begins to see that his course may not be the right one after all and could very well damn the world.<br />A MEMORY OF LIGHT is an extraordinary volume, and a more than worthwhile ending to a story that has enchanted readers for so long. To go into each and every nuance of the plot would require far more time and space than is allotted here -- the 900-plus pages have varied point-of-view characters spread to various corners of the world, engaged in all manner of combat and desperation. Besides the vast amounts of time it would take to do credit to the depth of the story, to go on too much would spoil the discovery of reading the pages yourself. It is no exaggeration, however, to say that A MEMORY OF LIGHT is epic in all ways: in size, in the scope of the tale and the cast involved, in depth, and as a finale, it is epic in weight on an emotional level, from what is presented in words and from what readers carry with them over 20 years.<br />A debt of gratitude must be paid to the late Robert Jordan. He put an idea to paper and engaged a dreamer in every reader who cracked open the spine of that first book. As a master craftsman, he hooked you, and as the story expanded, as the trials and travails of our heroes deepened and threatened all, more and more readers came into the fold. A number of cliches of fantasy were abandoned. In many ways, he lent credibility to the genre once more and proved that it is just as worthwhile a vehicle for ideas and insight as any &#34;literature.&#34; And so it was with good reason that readers lamented the loss of this artist before his full vision was realized.<br />Thanks and gratitude must also then be paid to Robert Jordan's wife, Harriet McDougal, who worked to see her husband's vision fulfilled, and selected Brandon Sanderson to complete it. And how, too, can we not express our thanks to Sanderson? It is a daunting task, indeed, to essentially set aside your own writing and ambitions only to take up one of the most beloved franchises in fantasy fiction history. With a series that had grown and, to some, stretched too wide and left too many loose ends, it was never going to be easy to fulfill Jordan's conceptual map. That Sanderson performed so extraordinarily is no surprise if you've read his other works, and they could not have selected a better writing companion for the late author.<br />As with any multi-volume work of this magnitude, some books will rise above others. Some story threads will excite more than others. Some characters will annoy more than others. Even diehard readers have leveled criticisms at The Wheel of Time. No work stands untarnished in the eyes of those who perceive it. A MEMORY OF LIGHT, by comparison to the previous volumes co-written by Sanderson (THE TOWERS OF MIDNIGHT and THE GATHERING STORM), is a half-step behind, yet that opinion does nothing to diminish the quality or success of the conclusion. It still stands as a testament to Jordan's creativity and absolutely carries the banner proudly. On the whole, no matter the opinions of the individual volumes, one can never see The Wheel of Time as anything more than an exemplary crown of achievement, and the journey from Page 1 to Page 12,521 is worth every turn.<br />And so the story of good friends --- of Rand, Perrin, Mat and Egwene, along with the host of other characters to whom readers have grown close --- will all draw together and come to a close. As with the preceding volumes, they have continued to grow, to learn, to show great strengths and weaknesses, and to have hearts broken and embrace victories. It is sad to see them go. There is a bittersweet quality to turning these pages, knowing that each turn brings you closer to the end. The decades-long story readers have walked and lived with and excitedly purchased new volumes of has come to its final pages. Hearts will be heavy as the cover is closed and the journey ends, a journey started by Robert Jordan and shared with us all. Those hearts will also rejoice, content that they could realize this ending, thanks to Brandon Sanderson. And yet it is not an ending, for as is written:<br />&#34;There are no endings, and never will be endings, to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was an ending.&#34;<br /><br />Reviewed by Stephen Hubbard
B009NX409M|3.0|Movie was &#34;okay&#34;...not a very complex plot. Principal actors were convincing but it seemed like the story could've been told in a much shorter time frame.
1250007208|5.0|Cinder is a fresh, futuristic take on Cinderella with enough plot changes to keep readers guessing til the end. Cinder is different, she's part cyborg, part machine, part human which makes her disliked by full humans. She does have an \\"evil\\" stepmother, spoiled step sisters, makes friends with an android (animal parallel) and does the family's dirty work for them. And of course there's a ball and a Prince, but that's where the the similarities start to fade rather quickly. Cinder has a mysterious past since she can't remember what happened before she was turned into a cyborg at age 11.  She's also a skilled mechanic and quite independent.<br /><br />Meanwhile there's a deadly plague with no known cure sweeping the post WWIV era world and the threat of war with the ruthless Lunar people of the Moon hanging over everyone. Somehow Cinder finds herself involved in the middle of everything making a wonderful story.<br /><br />Despite the fact it's a pretty fun, fast teen read, there are a lot of good discussible ideas within the actual story. Like why is it such a big deal that Cinder is part machine? Why does everyone assume ALL Lunars are horrible just because there ruler is? Why did the citizens of the nation so easily accept that cyborgs should be guinea pigs for the plague antidote?
B0095P31L6|1.0|Could not get past the first half hour. My son even lost interest. I found myself watching it alone, That is when we rented How to Train your Dragon which was delightful.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I had mentioned to a friend of mine that I had been watching &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; on Amazon and how much I was enjoying it. He then asked if we had seen &#34;Homeland&#34;. When we said no, he recommended it. Subsequently, we saw how many awards it won at the Emmys, and decided to give it a try. Clare Danes is outstanding! This series is not to be missed!!
141659521X|4.0|An interesting read as usual, My husband and I always enjoy his books.  It is not as good as some, but still enjoyed.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Another great season on Downton Abbey! I can't wait for season three. Drama, comedy, passion - all wrapped into one series. Very respectable series
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|the humor is mature, and the show continues to bring more new variety as the characters change and progress. very ntertaining.
B007EE4XKI|3.0|An interesting premise, though I found the authors writing a bit amateurish. I'm tiring of stories that continue beyond the scope of the films and shows, as they only deal less and less with the crew we know and love- however this one focuses pretty well on the main crew. It will be interested to see where this trilogy goes.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Just as it took Sky and Holder time, patience and each other to find hope, it took me a week to put my thoughts together and find my words for this book. I loved it. I loved the format with the dated chapters that felt like i was reading Sky's innermost thoughts in a diary. And I loved the writing. I've never read a description of a best first kiss that wasn't a kiss written in such a way that was so vivid that I could feel what Sky was feeling. A must read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you like Temple Run then you will like this because it`s just like this but more creative. I say it`s better than having to tilt because that really gets annoying
B005Q1W10A|5.0|It's an excellent adaptation of the period.  The script is extremely well written and the acting by all the characters is subperb.  The series is more than worthy to be part of my dvd collection.  Looking forward to watching  it over again periodically over the years.  I have already recommended this series with others.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Now that I have grand-kids I needed to get them started on loving this movie too. So happy to have found it for such a deal. Thank you
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I watched Argo the night before the Oscars and am glad I did. Not only because I actually saw the movie that won Best Picture for once, but because it was a really well told story. Ben Affleck has become one of my must see directors. Gone Baby Gone and The Town are both favorites and now I can add Argo to the list. When a movie has you sitting on the edge of your seat even when you know how the story ends that's a sign of a true story teller.
0679446230|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  Great novel.  I do not want to say anything else as I do not want to spoil this book.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I found this book redundant of how good-looking and wonderful Christian is.  It is easy reading but  seems to be written by an immature teenager, which I assume, Anastasia was sexually. I wonder why this trilogy got such great reviews and women copying some of Christian's sexual antics. I found  Ana's constant referrals to his wonderful physical attributes to be very annoying.
B009EE8ISE|5.0|awesome movie always have been one of my favorites everyone should get this movie and I love Emmy Rossum get it
B000MXJ7LS|1.0|I never got anything for my rental payment of 3 or 4 dollars except a long minute and a half or so trailer.  From clicking &#34;Watch Movie Now&#34; after payment cleared.  I suppose it could be an ok movie
0060936223|5.0|Just before I moved to NYC, a good friend of mine gave me their copy of this book. At that time, I was undecided the direction my life was about to take me, more specifically, was I driving towards the West Coast or back to the East Coast. Slowly as each page turned, I was enthralled by the words from this book, by the brilliant mysticism that Patti was able to draw from the city, breathing life into her art and her love. I knew by the final page that I had made my decision. Two years later, I'm still falling in love with NYC, every single day.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Enjoyed this book and looking forward to the movie, even though I know the ending. Inexpensive and a good read.
B0018RFLQ2|5.0|His acting was so realistic during his concentration. Also enjoyed seeing his interaction with adults.  Enjoyed seeing old news clips of Bobby Fischer.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I really enjoy this series. If you liked the first you'll love this as well! Very easy to read. Enoy!
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|It's really slow and I cannot get to anything I try to click on the first day I used it workd great and sense it has been horrible.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the show.  What a great cast and the setting is authentic.  It's nice to watch one episode after the other without waiting a week.  I look forward to the 3rd season.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I'm not sure it should have been movie of the year, but certainly a very good movie and story.  JCH
B0054U58AS|5.0|Excellent book about an excellent country. The book is well written and very interesting. The material could have come off as a bit bland and textbooky but the authors didn't a great job making a wonderful narrative.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Honestly, it's just like a lot of other Sudoku games.  But I like sudoku, so I liked this.  It's a nice app, with easy-to-get-around interface, and in general a nice... everything.  This isn't very deep, but sometimes sudoku is just sudoku, albeit quite a lot of it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|This was a fast paced enjoyable read.  Nothing too far out or unbelievable, just enough to finish in two days.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|There's nothing wrong with the execution of this game.  The square goes where it's told, and all the parts move how they're supposed to.  What's wrong with this game is... it's just boring.  Maybe if you're waiting at the mechanic's for a long time, but even so, I just couldn't possibly enjoy this game.  I saw some good reviews and thought it would be a fun one, but apparently it's just not for everybody.
B007N0REX6|5.0|What can i say&#60; another solid effort by the one and only. Great band and good classic rock sound, good drinking music
B007N9FKCY|3.0|Okay, so the game isn't bad in and of itself--you bounce a bean around and hope that it does what you want it to--but my Kindle Fire seems to do this in a slow and annoying manner.  The bean does what it wants to, in other words.  I'd prefer if it did what I wanted it to.  Alas.  The idea of the game itself, however, seems sound.  Just some poor execution...
B0040I09RM|5.0|Once I burned out (pardon the pun) on Rescue Me I went looking around Amazon Prime for something new and different.  I had seen commercials for SOA but never watched it.  Once I got started I could not stop.  I watched about 40 hours of episodes in the  ten days after viewing the first episode.  This is great TV.  For some it may be a little too violent, but the characters are so compelling the violence is necessary so that you don't become too comfortable with them. Now I am losing sleep, talking about the show with total strangers, and thinking about joining an MC just to wear a &#34;cut.&#34;  I think I may need to find an SOA twelve step program...
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is so easy to setup and use.  It really works well.  True remote desktop experience.  Best remote app that I've found.  I highly recommend it!
B0038ZITIE|5.0|I love watching this movie!!! I think every adult wanted to be Flash Gordon at one time in their life.
B005NWUSOI|5.0|Compared to their older albums, I really like McGinnon's clean voice on this album. The hard vocals are a lot better too. He has a distict quality to his growls in this album. The drum beats pump me up, the guitar riffs and breakdowns are enthusiastic, it's very hard-rock punkcore.<br />I like all of the songs, but the ones that stick out the most to me is definitely the first one: &#34;The Downfall of Us All&#34;, &#34;I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of&#34;, &#34;Have Faith in Me&#34;, &#34;Holdin' It Down for the Underground&#34;, and &#34;If It Means A Lot to You&#34;<br />And in my opinion this is their best album! :)
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Amazing..... One of the best singing type movies since Sister Act... I would recommend watching this movie to any one...
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I never had a problem. Works great and is easy to figure out. It's not bad for a free app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! Of course I am a big horse lover and this helps until I can get a real horse. Play it all the time. The game is challenging enough, moving up in levels doesn't take too long and I love how real the horses look. The only thing I can complain about is the advertisements for other games available to play seem to be popping up more frequently. Just a small irritation and doesn't stop me from playing. I give it five stars.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My grandson age 9 loves this game he plays it everyday. Will be getting if for my tablet too&#60; love it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was very sad this entire book, but I still couldn't put it donw, read Catching Fire first or it will be hard to understand. This is not a stand alone book, you need to read the first two FIRST&#62;
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Clever, colorful and so cute. The ads don't bother me, there aren't that many and, after all, it's a free version.
B003O86FMW|5.0|i can't believe how increadible the book was, I could not put it down. I JUST PLAIN LOVED IT. READ it for yourself.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|cute & so addictive.just wish my kindle didnt lop off play area on some levels. can't argue with free tho (the ads are not intrusive).
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I thought I was getting a cover that was a little thicker than this one is.  I hope that it will protect my kindle.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I very much enjoyed the movie. Cudos go to Ben Affalack. I may end up purchasing this movie in the future.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Perfect ending. It gives us hope and shows our strengths and weaknesses.  It sends a message of what has and could again happen today.
B00177YA1K|5.0|I love this movie! I have probably seen it 20 times but it's alwsys great every time I see it. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith make for a great duo!!!!!!
0061438294|4.0|Really good book. I learned a lot from it. There is so much information being transferred during communication and without being able to interpret the settle signs you miss about half what a person is saying. This book showed me how to read the subtle forms of body language and made me aware of it. Afterwards I begin to pick up on other settle signs the book didn’t mention because my eye was open.
B0063M22QO|1.0|Played until I got to the Challenge part and it wouldn't allow me to play that. Would not unlock and highlight Play.
B00461ZOI2|3.0|The book really wasnt engaging to me. The begining was interesting. I enjoyed following Pi through his family  life and his search for meaning through religion but then I got bored when he was in the boat which was actually the height of the story. There is a big twist in the end but it wasnt big enough for me to feel any different towards the book. its okay
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I wanted to have Season Three for my library to complement the first two.  A wonderful cast of characters; well worth watching.
B0053TMP24|5.0|BEST EVER!!!!!!!!!!! D d d d d d 3 3. 3 3  3  33  3 5 6 7 8 9
B004I744AS|5.0|I am a horrible speller. Thanks to this little helper I do not have to guess at the spelling and embarrass myself.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|It was a realy good book and i enjoyed it also i was quit mad when it ended brcause i wanted to keep reading.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A very good book!!! Will read it again!!!! Couldn't wait to get to the end. Suzanne Collins excellent is an excellent author.
B00000633U|5.0|What can I say about this album that hasn't already been said?? It received critical acclaim, and rightfully so. Hard-hitting, but also tender lyrics...Richard Marx is a master songwriter with a killer voice to deliver those great songs that he writes...an unbeatable combo!!! Buy a backup copy....you may need it! I'll buy it on vinyl if it ever comes out in that format, I love it that much!!
B00138KJY0|5.0|Love this album! Classic Michael Jackson and a great addition to any collection. I'm glad I saw this. Great buy!
0425263916|5.0|She's done it again!!!!!! Fantastic follow up to the other crossfire novel!  Full of surprises and hot hot sexy scenes! And an ending that will leave you breathless! This is a must read!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I wanted to share it with my children. Must have for a movie lovers' collection. Great value and my children enjoyed the movie.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|A lot of journeying but love the puzzles-and finding my way around.Well worth paying and playing.Had fun and exercised the ole brain cells.<br />Kudzu
B000VMBXNA|4.0|This little story is quite a whimsical idea that the Queen might actually interact with a lower level staff member in an equally silly idea that she would go to a bookmobile.  It is charming that she seemed human, after all she is a figurehead of global proportions.<br />I was a little bit disappointed that she did not seem to care that her charge was dismissed without her consent.  But it all works out well in the end.  It is a great British farce that would work well in a BBC comedy.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|Took a little playing with but now I like it. Didn't like the delete functionality, but once I refined the auto insert mode timing, I could enter individual words without disturbing the flow of sentence entry.
1619691809|4.0|John Corey and his FBI wife, Kate Mayfield are in for the &#34;mission&#34; of their lives...literally. Infectious page turner!<br />Definitely requires a sequel.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|This movie followed the book very well, and the story is a great one.  Don't let the subtitles bother you. They lend reality to the story.
B007REV4YI|3.0|This is NOT the best Bond ever. It was a good story and I do love Daniel Craig, but it was disappointing that it was touted as a trilogy to Quantum of Solace and Casino Royal when it had nothing to do with either movie!
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|Awesome movie with plenty of jumpy scares. The ending is a bit long and overdone, but the rest of the movie is great.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The writing is so REAL!  It's like he sat down and told this story and someone wrote it down word for word, Texas colloquialisms included.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Wish the renewel on the coins was quicker but I love this game. Very addictive, can't put it down and highly recommended it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent just like seasons 1 & 2, although I felt this season was more like a soap opera. Still enjoy watching it and always love the characters and soundtrack.
1601251556|5.0|This Flip-Mat is probably the best investment you can make for your game.  It beats Chessex's BattleMat in every way!  I own both products, and keep coming back to the Flip-Mat, I'm about to buy my third!  Here's why:<br /><br />Size:<br />The Flip-Mat  is 24\\"X30\\" when completely unfolded, this is compared to the BattleMat's 26\\"X23\\".  If you need a bigger mat, then you can simply buy two Flip-Mats and combine them. This is still cheaper and more flexible than Chessex's solution, which buying Chessex's MegaMat, which is about $36 (you can buy three Flip-Mat's and have the flexibility of separating them for smaller games for that much!).<br /><br />Price:<br />Here's where the Flip-Mat shines the brightest.  the Flip-Mat has square grids on BOTH sides.  The BattleMat has hexagons on one side and squares on another.  If you're playing with 1\\" square grids then you cannot go wrong with the Flip-Mat.  Did I mention that the BattleMat is more then DOUBLE the price of the Flip-Mat?!  That's like getting four BattleMat's for the price of one!<br /><br />Staying Flat:<br />I've heard complaints that this mat doesn't stay completely flat when pulled out of packaging.  While true, this applies to both the BattleMat and the Flip-Mat.  They both have the same problem/solution as well, flatten them with books and weights for a day.  After flattening the Flip-Mat it remains very flat.  Not as flat as the BattleMat, but flat enough to where it can function flawlessly when you put mini's on it or try to draw on it.  Also, when you finish using the BattleMat and roll it up, you have to flatten it or it will curl up a bit.  The same can be said with the Flip-Mat when you fold it though.<br /><br />Versatility:<br />The Flip-Mat can handle all types of markers while the BattleMat will stain.  Also if you use the wet-erase markers that BattleMats require and don't wash them off within a week, it will stain the mat!  So if you like to prep maps before gaming sessions and don't happen tohave enough time to use the map, then be prepared to redraw the map!<br /><br />If you're looking for a reusable mat, then look no further.  This is the mat you want!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome.  I would recommend this to my family and friends this is a good game to play when you are stressed out
B0094K35S6|5.0|The Matrix is an awesome movie. If I ever need a good sci-fi action it is there with open arms.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|it was shipped fast and it was at a low price compared to wal-mart that wantted $49.99 for the blu-Ray.
B0094KT9Y0|4.0|This is a great movie, but it is depressing. Most of the movie the toys are abandoned or imprisoned. Still a good movie, still a great movie, but just a little sad.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like subway surfers because it gives me something to do when I'm bored. I am really happy with this game, I see nothing that needs to be improved, thank you.
B00APJLEGA|3.0|I though the movie was cheesy and a bit predictable. My son, however, loved the movie for all the funny and silly antics. Overall, it was okay.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play it so much I have 30000 coins! I could buy a ninja a robot and a girl! I'm still saving.
B0094KT68O|5.0|The first one is good, the third one is a bit depressing, but the second is just right. This movie is just fun, plain and simple.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|If you love Star Trek like I do how can you not love watching the episodes. Prime membership is great.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|Vevo has come a long way. When it first came out there was hardly any content worth watching, but now they a very wide spectrum of music video to watch.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Schindler's List is a true masterpiece of a film, because it shows the power of a dark and horrific time in history, but at the same time it also shows that humanity and the strength of the human spirit does shine through the horror of the Holocaust.
B00846F1YW|3.0|The game was fun to play. The story and characters in it are stupid. Everything with the story seems like it was done last minute. The game is good though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a pretty good game. It is very entertaining and addicting. I would recommend this game to people of all ages.

B00BHU9CCO|4.0|Super fun movie. Pixar movies are good when you and your kids want to watch something together. Monster Inc. is one of my top Pixar movies.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I am attempting to write a memoir.  I liked King's book both for the conversational style in his memoir portion and the specifics he shared later about plying his craft.  I have never cared for his genre of writing, but this book has nothing to do with that and all to do with a master craftsman's sharing techniques of the art he loves.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|This is the one of the best games available on Kindle Fire right now, without a doubt. It is the real Final Fantasy III, non-abridged, with all the tropes Final Fantasy is known for.<br /><br />It's a huge file, over 200 mb, but it installed fine on my device.<br /><br />Why didn't I give it 5 stars? Several reasons:<br />1-No instruction manual. It would have increased the file size slightly, but they could have added an option on the start screen for \\"Instructions\\" with all the text from the manual that came with the cartridge version of the game.<br />2-No New Game +. It's a constant complaint with FF games that have a job system. The game isn't long enough to sample all the jobs, and some of the more interesting ones don't become available until right before the final dungeon. I want to start over with all jobs available so I can challenge myself to beat the game with 4 rangers or somesuch.<br />3-Weak/non-existent characterization. I went from Final Fantasy I to FF 7, then 8, 9, 10, 10-2, and then 3. I want my characters to interact with each other, to experience growth, to have strong motivations, as in iterations 7-10. What makes the characters in 3 tick? Why are they doing what they're doing? How have they grown together as a group? As it is, here they are pretty much cutouts, with nothing but sprite design to distinguish them.<br />4-Final boss was too easy, but secret boss is waaaaaaay to hard. I got my butt handed to me by the final boss the first time around (I was at level 50 or so). So I did some level/job grinding and came back at level 65. During the final boss fight, none of my characters died, or even got into low HP status. Meanwhile, I can't go two rounds with the Iron Giant without getting wiped out. I don't want to level grind that much to beat one boss. Final Fantasy 8 had the best way of dealing with this, and it should be used in other FF games.<br /><br />So that's how to make this great game better, in this humble player's opinion. I had 40+ hours of fun with the kindle fire app, and I see myself having more hours of fun when I feel like starting a new game from scratch.0+ hours of fun with the kindle fire app, and I see myself having more hours of fun when I feel like starting a new game from scratch.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|It's been a while, approximately 5 years since his last release, the jazzy \\"Speak Low\\" CD which had an R&B feel to it like previous \\"Silk Degrees\\" offering from years gone by. This new release takes us back in time, Memphis represents the best of all extremes,(from soul to jazz and the R&B in between) a set of 13 well-chosen soul tracks (including two originals), backed by legends of the music city that lends the album its title.<br /><br />I read...<br /><br />\\"Recorded at Royal Studio, site of Al Green's greatest sessions, producer/drummer Steve Jordan captures an early '70s vintage sound from a crew of classic hands, including Spooner Oldham on electric piano, Ray Parker Jr. on guitars, Willie Weeks on bass, the Memphis Horns, and string arranger, Lester Snell. The result is one of Boz Scaggs' most satisfying collections of his solo career.\\"<br /><br />This can be a complicated journey at times with plenty of genre jumping, crooning, reggie, Delta blues, ballads, R&B to name a few. Quite a mixture of covers but as usual Scaggs' musical voice shines, he brings something to this CD that we have never heard before. They're the same warm, subtle sounds found on soul recordings made by Al Green and other artists at Memphis' Royal Studio in the 1970's. \\"Nobody can touch Green, even four decades later, for pure carnal rapture, but I'll be damned if Scaggs, at least on these cuts, doesn't get right up to the edge of it.\\"<br /><br />Scaggs' bluesy voice, is still in top shape. \\"Listen to the way he drops into the music on the opening `Gone Baby Gone' like a soft-speaking ghost who wants to fill you in on his sad, lonely story. It's expert timing by an artist who's made a career out of this sort of thing.\\" Check out [[ASIN:B0002IQI2Y Boz Scaggs - Greatest Hits Live]]<br /><br />The Royal Studio, brings us back in time, \\"So Good to Be Here\\" a deep cut from Green's 1973 album \\"Livin' for You\\" and \\"Can I Change My Mind\\" a Top 5 hit for Tyrone Davis in 1969, has Scagg's following a similar path to that of Al Green. A borrowed style, but he pulls it off easily. He has also earned the right.<br /><br />The music takes me back to his 1969 release \\"Loan Me A Dime\\", Boz Scaggs featured the muscle shoals Rhythm Section, along with session guitarist Duane Allman on that one. The style of music is very familiar to that great tune.<br /><br />The bulk of the cuts on the album are sweet, laid back, Memphis soul, with a couple of blues cuts thrown in for good measure. \\"Rainy Night In Georgia\\" is soft and unhurried, \\"Dry Spell\\" is a slow shuffle blues with Charlie Musselwhite on harmonica, \\"Love On A Two Way Street\\" is straight-up soft soul and \\"Cadillac Walk\\" has a moderate boogie/blues feel to it with some great piano.<br /><br />The vocal range Scaggs has today is amazing, this is music for the heart, the head and all points in between. In this way, Scaggs has made a triumphant return, after a five-year hiatus between projects. Listen with your heart and try not to over think the music, and Boz will map out a conclusive argument for his place as one of our greatest living soul singers.<br /><br />There is not one bad cut on the whole CD, too many great tunes to critique but one thing is certain, this will be one of the top releases of 2013.

B00B99KJR0|4.0|Fairly similar to another Playrix game which I like.<br />Cons: can't figure out how to clear the frozen and locked tiles that are not part of the grid other than building up points in order to clear them; but in that case, I've never been able to get more than one star.<br />Pros: Good challenge. I'll keep working on it.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This film was brilliant and fully deserving of the best picture. Although my brain new from history what was going to happen, this movie nevertheless taunt and engrossing all the way through. Affleck did a marvelous directing job in this film and it is very unjust that he was not nominated for best director. This film is very tense and exciting in places, but there are a lot of funny scenes that satirize Hollywood.<br /><br />Although many have criticized this film as presenting all Iranians as evil, that is simply not true. Affleck includes a number of \\"nice\\" Iranian characters, including:<br /><br />1. The Iranians waiting for visas in the American Embassy at the beginning of the film.<br />2. The maid at the house of the Canadian ambassador who does not betray them.<br />3. The information minister who talks about how most Iranian movie theaters showed pornography before the revolution.<br />4. The guide during the scene in the bazaar who explains what a \\"foreign bride\\" film is.<br /><br />The prologue also helpfully explains why the Iranian people were do angry at the Shah. This does not legitimize the violent storming of an Embassy, whose personnel are protected by international law, and taking the personnel hostage. Although Affleck does take some historical liberties, the essential truths of the horror of the storming and hostage taking and the cruel treatment of the hostages are portrayed accurately. For example, the scene where the Iranians mock-execute some hostages really happened.<br /><br />The hostage taking in Iran was very popular at the time, but soon after and certainly by now many Iranians are having second thoughts about the conservative, theocratic regime the hostage-taking helped install. The \\"Green Movement\\" protests after the 2009 Iranian presidential election certainly show this.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to everyone.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Characters are decently developed, enough that you can get a good picture in your mind of the two main characters and their love story.  I would recommend as a summer or beach read.  Something fun and lighthearted.
1616550414|5.0|This is fabulous okay. What more do you need? You got concept art galore, a timeline explaining every single contradiction Nintendo has made about the order of games, a comic that makes your eyes shiny. Plus I got it in perfect condition with air bags. Bags full of air; what more can you ask for?

B00AA0TZTW|5.0|To those complaining about this, lighten up. Did you expect to hear something recorded just last week by a man who's been dead for almost 43 years?  Did you expect to hear Hendrix's take on a U2 song or a duet with Joe Bonamassa?<br /><br />Any devoted Hendrix fan kind of knew we'd hear songs we've heard a thousand times before. Different mixes. Different takes. I mean, considering his short life, the work still out there is amazing. To me, a lifelong Hendrix admirer and one who has heard everything (and I mean everything, I have bootlegs and other Hendrix stuff that if I hit \\"play\\" on iTunes would go for months) I like it. I like it a lot.<br /><br />This album sounds very fresh like it's Jimi in a room, live with 2 other guys. Period. Not some 45 tracks mixed together. Intimate. That's the word, intimate. \\"Somewhere\\" sounds very much like Jimi with his Strat and a Vox wah-wah plugged into a Marshall and that's about it! That's where you admire Hendrix the most IMO. Yeah, I've heard way too many versions of all these songs but, to me, these versions are up there with the best.<br /><br />Let's not forget the mix either. I have a pretty decent audio setup with DAC's and tube amps, old school speakers along with new ones. I go back and forth with them. Face it, some of Hendrix's recordings were dreadful as to quality. They weren't meant to be released. West Coast Seattle Boy's recordings sound very good to me. I love the mono versions of Axis and Are You Experienced. If I had to choose Hendrix's most explosive playing it'd be Band of Gypsies. Gives me goosebumps to this day.<br /><br />But I hate saying that because I always have to add in Axis, AYE, EL.....etc; etc; I mean, how can you just pick ONE? But, getting back to PH and A's, it's quality mix allows me to push it. Cranking the volume to the limit (with good equipment) with Hendrix? Is there another way?<br /><br />Look, I'm not about to dissect track by track on this. IMO, if you are a true Hendrix fan, you listen to EVERYTHING! I want to hear every nuance to every version of every song. This album is a worthy add to any Hendrix collection. We pretty much have to get what we can. It is what it is. Recordings made 40 plus years ago that weren't made to be released. I'm hearing some new playing here by the guy I never get tired of hearing play. Sure, I'd love a double album (remember those?) of all new Hendrix recordings uncovered in some dusty vault. That's be great. But, we have to be thankful that we have this much from him! Look, Duane Allman is another all time favorite and there is far too little recorded stuff of him. Sure, I've heard the Muscle Shoals stuff but, the stuff when he was at his peak? Not much around and most of it is pretty poor quality. The new box set with him is pretty much old stuff we've all heard before. At least with Jimi, there is a ton of stuff.<br /><br />Good enough for me and really, very enjoyable. I give it 5 stars because I'm listening to it over and over. It must be good. I don't give things a second go 'round too often these days.<br /><br />Don't be unrealistic and expect a recording from last week with all new songs. Like I said, it is what it is and IMO, it is good. Very good.isten to EVERYTHING! I want to hear every nuance to every version of every song. This album is a worthy add to any Hendrix collection.

B00BHMF578|4.0|Fun, fast moving, and definitely worth seeing. A bit over rated -- not as much human depth/character development as  Lincoln or The Sessions
B003Y5H574|5.0|We originally saw this movie when it came out in the theatre and while it has eye candy for the ladies it is a great story as well.  It surprised me, which is hard to do, I can usually figure out what is going to happen before the end but this is one of the few that when the reveal came I did not see it ahead of time.  Liked it so much I purchased it, which I rarely do these days.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed this series.  It was a great summer read.  I can't wait to see what they do with the movie.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|I like Michael Connelly, he has been one of my favourite crime writers and the character Harry Bosch is well characterised and the stories behind his investigations always seem plausible. It may be wise to know that I live in rural Victoria, Australia about 60 miles South of Melbourne and the novels are usually set about LA. However, I have been to LA a number of times and have visited California 10 times since 1985. The Black Box is engaging from the start and builds on the relationship with his daughter and his general life and work set up in previous novels. It is fine as a stand alone novel but after reading most in sequence I got a great deal of enjoyment. I also need to mention that I also love the novels of a local author, Garry Disher, especially the Challis and Destry series. Both the Michael Connelly novels and the Garry Disher crime stuff are rollicking story telling that relate to a local environment that I enjoy reading

It's not only entertaining from beginning to end but the feeling you get from this story lasts long after the movie is over.  The Intouchables is based on the true story of an unexpected friendship that forms between a wealthy paraplegic and a young man from the slums of Paris who has surprisingly been hired to be his caregiver.  This story will leave you bursting with energy to go after everything you can get out of life.  Even if you think you've lost it all, there's always so much more.<br /><br />Jennifer A.

I love sci-fi and this series is great.<br /><br />It's sci-fi and western mix.  The characters are an oddball collection but are very funny in their interactions between them.

B002MQYOFW|2.0|While the story is fast-paced and loaded with action, it lacks real character development and depth of plot.  Clearly this is a story for young readers.  It reminded me of A Wrinkle in Time which is a youth novel.  I'm afraid I don't see the appeal to adult audiences, nor can I look forward to the continuing adventures of Catniss et al.

B000I3P3EM|5.0|The Undiscovered Country is a triumphant return to form after the lackluster Final Frontier. In this movie, we're treated to some good action, a richer and more compelling storyline, and good special effects for its time. For the plot, please read other reviews. Instead, I want to focus on the message of the movie. This movie is about breaking down the barriers of humanity, and instead of betrayal, there's diplomacy. In the end, trust is mutually earned between the fighting parties (Klingons and Federation). As usual, the writers carry an underlying theme to the movie, and in the wake of the end of the Cold War, this film was fresh in our psyche. This Star Trek film has it all: action, suspense,humor, a good plot, and great acting. Don't miss this excellent film in the otherwise erratic Star Trek movie franchise. 9/10
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was a great book kept u wanting to read more .very interesting to read and a lot of mysterious about sky/ hope
B005PK56TA|5.0|This was one of those happy accidents.  I was searching online for another TV show when this one came up.  Once I realized some of my favorite actors would be involved, I thought it would be worth the watch, especially since I could view it on Amazon Prime (cost-free).<br /><br />This is not for the faint of heart, or the easily spooked.<br /><br />But if you like psychological intrigue, blended with the supernatural, you are in for a treat.  Brilliant acting, edgy story-lines, sensuality, horror, and all the foibles of human nature (and not so human nature).<br /><br />One extra-cool thing is that the season is self-contained, so you can watch Season 1 as a complete story-line without needing to watch Season 2.  No cliff-hanger nonsense, just a great season, start-to-finish, with surprises in each episode that make you want to re-watch previous episodes for subtle clues.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham takes you through a somewhat expected journey, with several unexpected twists.  This one was hard to put down.  Absolutely enjoyable!!

B0058YPL66|5.0|I picked up the entire first season of Once Upone a Time from my library has I had missed getting in on it from the start, and watched all the episodes over the course of a few days.<br /><br />Very entertaining and well done. I can't wait for the second season to complete so I can do the same thing.<br /><br />I liked Robert Carlyle as the 'sort of' villain in Stargate Universe, and thought the role they gave him here was even better suited to his acting talents.<br /><br />Its obvious to see ties to the writers from Lost in this new series, especially in the titles for each episode. Let's hope they don't screw this one up with a dud of an ending - or a premature ending to the series because of potentially bad writing down the road.<br /><br />All in all a wonderful new, modern take on fairy tales and a lot of fun to watch!

B005LAII3U|3.0|This movie started out awesome. I like the way it was following the same pattern as the original, but then it trailed off when we really got down to the plot. Instead of it being about controlling a planet by controlling thier air supply it was about controlling a planet with some stupid robots! So lame to me. On a positive note the action was pretty good and Collin Farrell did excellent. I know you guys will probly hate me for this but i hated every single female in this movie. Even the tri-breasted hooker was not satifying like the original. Visually though the movie was great as well. It was like a cross<br />between minority report and the new dredd<br />movie. I also like the way they gave a couple of references to the original but there was none of that bone crunching, white knuckle action like<br />the first one. But i guess it had to be its own<br />movie.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|First off, sorry my name's so long, it wouldn't let me do the name I really wanted. This is an AWESOME, AMAZING, INCREDIBLE game!!!! It is so great for people who love solving mysteries with different scenes and props and everything. I looked all over for a game like this and none were as fun as this. Though it cost 0.99 $ it was worth well over that. It takes place in an exotic forest were you try to find all four heart stones and return the normal seasons to the island. And for those extra hard parts there's a guide for the cheaters. ( like me :o) ) It was just such an amazing game I could play over and over! My only suggestion: Make more like this! The one about the mansion was definitely not as good as this one!
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game easy to use lots of choices for play makes it a very versital product great for down time at work lol
B002KYGLVQ|2.0|When looking for a movie to watch I noticed this one had 4.5 stars so I decided to give it a try..... I wanted to like it, I had high hopes, please Hollywood, i thought, give me some decent entertainment. Something with beautiful cinematography, great acting, clever dialog, and a powerful story. It seems like I'm asking for way to much because more and more I find myself highly disappointed at the movies, and for me this movie was just another disappointment.<br />  Set in the near future of a world where Germany won ww2 a
B00B935SUY|5.0|This movie is so inspirational.  Made me love Dave Grohl even more.  I recommend this movie to EVERYONE!!  Watch this!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I really don't have 20 freaking words to say about this movie or any other review I wish to give..
B009NX409M|5.0|This is a girly flick. Very good love story. Love these two actors in anything they do. Does not show flesh, just a good story that leaves to your imagination.
B00AGMTA62|5.0|This DVD is exceptional in most part.  The music and the conductor are great. At times a bit too much wandering of the camera to paintings on the ceiling and chandeliers.  Expected Julie Andrews narration to be included.  Still well worth its money.
1419705849|5.0|I LOVED getting this for such a good price!  And my son loves this book and has read it over and over again!
B0062OCNAI|5.0|Heart wrenching. Amazing and suspenseful. The author did a marvelous job at keeping it suspenseful, never gets boring. Absolutely great!
0920668372|5.0|I just love this book and was so excited to get it for so cheap!  My kids love hearing it every night!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Bought this for my edc and it is great. works as advertised and it is great to be able to sharpen your blade on the go.
B0063GORYU|4.0|The format is a little small for my Tab, but I like it. The moves are easy and flow nicely rather then the jerky movements of other Appa.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|sometime confusing and hard to understand what was going on...the idea is okay but but to much<br />terrible  ending  !!
B005GRTNVE|5.0|I know that I will never be able to see them in person (I do wish I could) but this dvd makes you feel like you are right there watching them in person.  Their music is so soothing and enjoyable.  The cost of this dvd is perfect and I bought together with their new cd &#34;Greatest Hits&#34; 2 deluxe cd version which is very reasonable here at Amazon.  I definitely recommend to anyone - you are truly getting your $$'s worth with purchasing this dvd and the greatest hits 2 deluxe cd's.  Treat yourself to some truely good music.  Thanks Amazon for this amazing deal!
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I am hooked on Lark Rise to Candleford.  I am a devotee of Downton Abbey and found this series to be as wonderful.  The characters are rich and the story lines are masterfully woven togethers.
B0096BIENY|5.0|A must for all Il Divo fans - all their best songs all combined in one.  When I purchase music I always try to purchase a \\"Greatest Hits\\" cd - versus individual cd's - because you get all the great music of that artist - all in one package.<br /><br />I am a BIG fan of Il Divo and have ALL their cd's and dvd's and when I get overwhelmed with my work or life - I put on one of their cd's or dvd's and just listen to their smoothing voices.  I have been listing to them since they became a group - going on 8 years now.<br /><br />I even bought a second cd too - just in case one breaks - I couldn't find in any stores this cd.<br /><br />They helped me get through some of my life's heartaches (losing a parent, losing my two pets due to old age in less than a year) and my life's joys (birth of 3 beautiful granddaughters and marriages of my children).
1451696191|4.0|I was grateful for this book after having just finished an intense book.  I found it a relaxing narrative.  Charlie, the narrator, writes the events of his life in a series of letters to a person we only know as &#34;friend.&#34;<br /><br />Charlie is a &#34;bystander&#34; in life.  He tends to watch people rather than participate.  I found him to be relatively compassionate, though awkward and stupid in actual relationships.  Despite his people-watching, he doesn't seem to understand them.<br /><br />Generally, most of the characters are people you should like...even if they sometimes act like b***holes or b****es.  The book explores the important relationships in Charlie's life.  First, there is his family--not the worst family in the world, but one with its share of secrets and problems.  Anyone with an effed up family will identify--there is the grandfather who embarrasses everyone by talking about how many black people there are, the one female relative who got knocked around, etc.<br /><br />Then there are the friends that Charlie makes, the two most important being brother and sister Patrick and Sam.  Charlie has a crush on Sam, who is quite a bit older.  Patrick is gay and is having a secret love affair with the high school's quarterback.  I particularly enjoyed Patrick, who is rather sage in his own way.  Patrick and Sam have many colorful friends that add to the flavor of this book.<br /><br />Charlie's English teacher has a small role in the book, but what is interesting about this relationship is the many books that are discussed.  With his friends, there are also many songs and movies that are referred to.<br /><br />Though I believe adults will like this book, it is about teenagers--so I am assuming it was originally met as teen fiction.  It is an Mtv book.  It is one of those &#34;awkward teen forms important friendships and grows from them, discovering something crucial about himself&#34; type of books.  The timing isn't in the present.  I was actually a little bit confused about it.  Charlie's friends enjoyed acting out the Rocky Horror Show, but some of the songs seemed a little later.<br /><br />To some degree, I thought the book lost a little steam towards the end...but overall, I did like it.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Since we have to wait an entire year for more episodes, I need a way to revisit this addictive show.
159514188X|5.0|This book, in some ways, gave me the same feeling as a horror movie.  You know how the character is slowly going up the steps, and they are about to open a door that you know something scary is lurking behind--and you have this mixed feeling about whether you should.  Part of you really doesn't want to see the scary thing behind it, and the other part of you does.<br /><br />This book isn't scary, but you feel the same way about the tapes that Clay Jensen receives in the mail.  These tapes are the narrative of a girl he liked that committed suicide.  On the tapes, Hannah Baker tells all who are listening to them that if they receive these tapes, they are one of the reasons why she killed herself.  Clay Jensen can't figure out why he would be one of her reasons, and this distresses him greatly.  You also feel compelled to read to find out the reason, and also why this girl killed herself.  Yet, sometimes you wonder if you really want to know.<br /><br />My feelings about Hannah were mixed.  I could understand why some of the things people did to her upset her.  However, Hannah did some terrible things herself...sometimes worse than the things she complains about other people doing to her.  The one important moral that I did get out of it was that our actions can impact people--positively or negatively--in ways we can't imagine.  We don't know what is going on in other people's lives, and a little bit of insensitivity can mean more to them than it does to us.<br /><br />The book also deals with the stigma surrounding suicide.  It touches on how it often inspires anger, and how many people consider it an act of total selfishness--a plea for attention.  This can make it difficult for people to get help that have the desire to end their life.<br /><br />I did sometimes get confused because there were actually two narratives going on at the same time.  Hannah's narratives were written in italics, and Clay's were written in normal print.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I can wait for more, I made some friends jelous because I knew what happen before them, now we all know

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like the face that it can read to me while I am busy doinf something else.  Never knew it was available until after I watched the BIBLE on television.  I am really enjoying it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I would have rated it 5 stars if not for the fact thy it cheats you out of some of you games and when u hit the undo button it counts as a move.
B004Y042N8|5.0|Fun and challenging. I really enjoy playing it to pass the time. The puzzles get more and more challenging the further into the levels you get.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Second season was not disappointing, kept you in suspense of what was happing both upstais and down, can't wait for the 3rd season to be released.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|I love this game. It is interesting...not to hard and not to easy. Keeps me occupied for hours. I bought it for entertainment on the plane but found I  play it all the time.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I was jamming on this game until I lost all my data on it. So yeah I hate this game now. And get this I lost my data even after  I second time and I had the silver and gold dragon, and the really big one that distorts time.
B009K6DKTS|5.0|Nassim Taleb is clearly an exceptionally intelligent analyst of risk. This book complements his earlier work &#34;Black Swan&#34;. The thoughts and ideas put forward in this book were new and valuable. I would recommend it to serious readers who think about the world around them and want to understand it better, particularly the risks we face day-to-day and those we do not expect. It gave me insights that will be of value to me in the future.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|My grandson play this game all of the time. It's helping him learn rule of the game and is teaching him colors.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|a fun way to learn about the care of horses, without all the mess.  great for children of all ages.
B004W2UBYW|2.0|reads like an encyclopedia style version of his life. Missing the real drama, struggles, heartaches and challenges that I think Steve Jobs faced. Kind of sterile in its tone and approach. I think it missed the real story of a entrepreneur who faced Herculean challenges and setbacks and how he responded to them.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it. Has really great graphics. I just wish there was more I could do. A lot of it is just clinking on things and waiting for it to be done.
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|It was an HD version, and I'm accustomed to Blu-Ray. Some parts were blurry (when they should've been clear, not blurry for artistic sake). The film itself is wonderful! Cuts some parts from the novel, but I understand why because of the novel's complexity.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is tons better than Rio and its fun to play on long car rides I would recommend it to everyone
B0000033RY|3.0|Yes, I did. More Cactus. More blues. More Rusty Day. But this was just OK. I wouldn't recommend it, brother.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is inspiring. I've had it less then 24 hours and I already want to start a new life!a must read!
B0056BMK6K|3.0|This book by John Locke is a very easy to read and easy to follow guide for authors (both fiction and non-fiction) to increase their sales.
B00B10GYZ8|5.0|EXCELLENT!<br /><br />The movie is good, the acting super, and the Kindle HD incredible--Anything with Helen Mirren is always going to be wonderful!
630469654X|5.0|I bought this DVD to replace the VHS I had. It was a used DVD and unfortunately has scratches, but thankfully they were corrected by a DVD repair kit. This movie is a great fantasy adventure with a love story woven throughout.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|Aliens have invaded America but we know we'll win in the end and we do because, well, we're America. Lots of battles at sea and surprisingly more of a story than I would think for a film of this caliber. Let's put it in Hawaii to make it exotic and so they did.<br /><br />The subplots were arguably more emotionally engaging than the CGI focused main tale.<br /><br />Starring Liam Neeson, Taylor Kitsch, Alexander Skarsgård, Rihanna, John Tui, Brooklyn Decker, and Tadanobu Asano.<br /><br />Good soundtrack.<br /><br />The budget was $209M and it made a bit over $303M. A video game came out at the same time and Hasbro re-released several editions of the classic board game (\\"You sank my battleship!).<br /><br />CINEMATAGRAPHY: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; ACTION/CGI: B to B plus; SOUND/MUSIC: B; WHEN WATCHED: mid February 2013; OVERALL GRADE: B.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|good movie...but to many F words! very informative about a true story in America! stayed on edge of seat esp. at the end!
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I watched the first 111 episodes on Netflix and then bought the last season on Amazon.  The show is great and the streaming off Amazon works great too.
B004W2UBYW|2.0|Isaacson has all the information needed to impart the life and deeds of Steve Jobs. Unfortunately, it is presented in a disjointed fashion in both timeline and personal achievements. A more adept writer would have used the same information to make a real page turner rather than a book which necessitated going back and forth, re-reading chapters to get the full picture. Required reading indeed but could have been so much simpler. Perhaps Jobs philosophy could have worked for the writer.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|These books are very well written and a good read.  I downloaded them onto my Kindle.  I love the Kindle for big books like this.  George R.R. Martin is an excellent storyteller.
B006OYD7EW|4.0|It seems The Mayor of Casterbridge can end only in one direction as this Mayor is continually victimized by his own shortcomings. As the novel begins, we witness the famous selling of his wife while he is in a drunken stupor, not caring about anything or anyone else in the world. Years later, he has his chance to make changes, amends but his essential character prevents this. He sees evil and devils where there are none and increases small faults to large. He turns friends to enemies and enemies to people who will do him wrong.<br /><br />I used to think that Hardy was about fate (when I was young) but now I see him as about character. His people earn the good and bad that happens by how they interact with the world around them, by their meanness or their generosity, their straightforwardness or their double-dealing. Fate watches and smiles or cries.<br /><br />My rating is between 4 and 5.<br /><br />Regarding this addition, the Oxford World Classics), I appreciated having the many footnotes that explain Hardy's many classical and historical allusions.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|Latest album and another Grammy special price. Couldn't pass it up as it's the only Black Keys album I didn't own. I think it's good but any of the earlier albums are better. Try &#34;the Big Come Up&#34; or &#34;Brothers&#34;. Both are less polished and I like that better.
B003UBTX72|3.0|Some good behind the scenes stories by a guy who you have to wonder if he was present during the actual happenings!
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Saw her on the Grammys. Played the video linked to the album on Amazon and bought it. Excellent freshman offering but the video is better than anything on the album..why? It's live. I think that's where this band shines.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game! I can never find any building/ management/ maintenance games that I like, but I grabbed this when I saw it! It is so awesome, and it's based on Jurassic Park, the movie! It's not some cheap wannabe. Why are there so few reviews? This app works great, and if it doesn't for you, that's your device, not the&nbsp;app! I'm going back to check on my dinosaurs. See ya!
0756405890|1.0|I did read some of the other negative reviews on this website before posting mine and I have to agree/disagree with some of the things said.<br /><br />I do think this author writes and articulates very well, and I do not think Kvothe is so arrogant he's unlikeable.<br /><br />So here's why I didn't like this book. The summary on the back of the book mentions all these great things that Kvothe does. It instantly made me want to read the story and read about those things. Let me repeat that: I wanted to READ ABOUT THOSE THINGS.<br /><br />I'm almost on page 500 now and I'm giving up. Why? Because none of those things that were summarized on the back of the book have actually happened! Can you believe it? Most of the book has been wasted, wasting my time reading about Kvothe when he was poor and homeless to poor and in the academy. He's still in the academy on page 500 so I'm assuming that what the main character said he did on the back of the book, isn't even going to happen in the last 100 pages or so. That's why I think this book is boring and has been a complete waste of my time.<br /><br />There was one exciting scene where his parents were killed and the killers were still there. They were mysterious and dangerous. I expected the book to really take off at that point, with everything that Kvothe said he did on the back of the book slowly coming to fruition in the next pages. Nope. Not a peep has ever been mentioned of them again. We've been at the academy singing songs, meeting people, having conversations with friends and rivalries with Ambrose that are boring now. They've been going on like that for the past 200 pages or so. It was time to move the story ahead 199 pages ago. Also, almost the entire first 200 pages of this book could have been omitted. All that time spent with Abenthy was boring to read, including all the plays their troupe put on. I didn't buy this book to read about those things. Severely disappointed.
B002RI90WM|5.0|beautifully written amazing book. I laughed and cried, loving dogs as I do made this book so special. How could you not enjoy this read,,,simply awesome.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|In a world populated with \\"reality\\" television and catastrophic dramas, there is a light at the end of the tunnel: New Girl, brainchild of Elizabeth Meriwether, starring Zooey Deschanel, Max Greenfield, Jake Johnson and Lamorne Morris.  Young L.A. school teacher breaks up with cheating boyfriend and moves in with three male roommates: overachiever Schmidt, underachiever Nick, and career-challenged Winston.  It's nice to see light, non-cynical comedy in a culture where dark, neurotic humor reigns (and annoys).  Max Greenfield and Zooey Deschanel get nominated for the awards, but Jake Johnson has created a character in Nick that makes me laugh till I can't draw breath.  Yay friendship, true love and American Nitwits!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Could not put it down.  It was such a great book and I am ready for the second book now.
0312548079|4.0|Something Blue by Emily Griffin is the sequel of Something Borrowed. In this book, Darcy Rhone was known for her beauty and charm. She was envied for her fiancé Dex and inseparable, lifelong best friend Rachel. She was content with her perfect man, dream wedding, incredible job and lavish lifestyle, until she uncovers the ultimate betrayal. Fleeing to London was initially an attempt to recreate her glamorous life. However, her luck has expired as her new journey begins. Redemption, forgiveness, and true love is searched for on this new continent.<br /> While reading Something Borrowed, Darcy Rhone was my least favorite character. However, while reading Something Blue, I grew to understand, appreciate and respect her. The other characters Emily Griffin introduced to the story added a stronger storyline. Ethan instantly becomes a character I fell in love with. His patience, understanding, love and care for Darcy is incredible. Something Blue by Emily Griffin is heartfelt and charming. This is a story that reveals the true meaning of friendship and happily-ever after. Darcy proves that sometimes you have to lose it all to appreciate and respect what you have.
0900652985|5.0|this is an excellent book.  I used it out of the library.  I am delighted to have a copy of my own.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it! Its just like temple run but better.I would recommend  you get this game today!If ypu dont your just crazy.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|same as the rest of the games. fun due to the theme but still the same. it is fun though.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It is very challanging.  It is my most favorite game so far.  I love it.
B00933JF74|2.0|This is a wonderfully charming and addictive game, but it is in dire need of written documentation!  Yes, there are instructions for the game, and tutorials, in the form of YouTube videos.  There's several problems with that though.  First, I'm a disabled vet with 60% hearing loss, and the videos are done by someone with a fairly heavy German accent.  I simply cannot understand what this person is saying.  He might as well be speaking Martian.  Seriously, unless what the tutorial is trying to show is plainly obvious from the screen alone, it simply is not comprehensible.  Another problem with relying on videos for help files, instructions and tutorials is bandwidth.  A text file I could simply store on the phone.  Several gigs of video files?  No, sorry, can't do that.  And if you don't have an unlimited data plan, accessing those videos could prove very costly.  And, you're going to need a good connection to do it, preferably wi-fi.  A third problem with videos is that it makes it difficult to bookmark anything for reference.  Suppose you're having problems with something, maybe you're trying to figure out what some of the icons and symbols mean.  If you have written documentation you can easily refer back to it as you also look at your screen.  To do the same with videos is simply not feasible.  You have to exit (or pause) the game, go to the video, fast forward (if you have it saved somewhere, otherwise wait for it to stream far enough to get to the spot you need) view what you needed to see, exit the video and then go back to the game.  Until a minute later when you need to look up something else.<br /><br />Really, this is a nice game, and I don't regret buying it, but I just can't figure it out well enough to actually play it, and will probably uninstall it in the near future.
B00ARAO1LC|2.0|i love matthew mcconaughey, and the reviews and trailer said it was one of his best movies....not!  silly perverse shoot um up...
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is a well written book. I tolerated the YA jargon because her prose was engaging. Love the end, although middle dragged a bit.
B009FZFONO|5.0|No really, best series ever.  I wish the episodes were longer.  They picked a great cast for the series.  Darrell better never die!!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season 3 was filled with 'drama',  but it is a lovely story, with lovely scenery and fun characters, watch out for episode 5.

0061537934|2.0|life thru a dog's eyes.  Read it for a book club, it was recommended by the only male member of the club, he had bought it for $2 at JR's.  He's not in the club anymore.  i GAVE this book away.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|First off, I've been a system builder for a very long time. I know what to expect and all that. I put this on an i5 2500k Sandy Bridge processor that is overclocked up to 4.5GHz.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Works pretty well. Keeps my Core i5 2500k overclocked at 4.5GHz cool down to 30 C when idle. Keeps it a little over 70 C when at full load. Good heat dissipation from the radiator attached.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Big heat sink (but that really isn't that big a con).<br />Instructions are a bit lacking. They could have spent more time actually writing some instead of using pictures.<br /><br />BIGGEST complaint is that my 120mm fan that it came with started making noises at over 1500RPM after maybe 7 months max use of it. Cooler Master's warranty is a COMPLETE JOKE!!!<br /><br />This fan costs like maybe $10, but in order to get a warranty replacement if it starts doing the rattling noise or going out, they will require you to send the fan into them so they can inspect it for you to get a replacement fan back. Sending this in will cost about $10. What is the point of a warranty if they will not ship out a new fan for a faulty one without requiring you to spend the amount of money a new one casts just to get a replacement? I mean, I really considered just buying a new one from somewhere else and abandoning hope on this \\"warranty\\". They are REALLY inflexible on it, too. I had to tweet their EU rep in order for him to hook me up with a replacement fan free of charge and that took a LOT of work.<br /><br />As a note, Corsair, who makes the 650D Obsidian case I have, does NOT make you send in bad components. I had the fan controller on the case go south, they sent me a new one free of charge, no questions, no fighting. I thought the noise this Cooler Master fan was making was coming from the top 200mm Corsair fan, so I asked them for a replacement and, you know what? They sent it to me! FREE OF CHARGE.<br /><br />A 200mm fan costs quite a bit more than a 120mm fan does, but yet Cooler Master wanted to be pricks about it and make me send in the old one which would have taken my machine out of commission for a week while they look at it and send me back a new one. Their \\"warranty\\" is a fricking joke!!!<br /><br />Oh, and get this, Cooler Master reps suggested I just go out and buy another 120mm fan to put on the system while I sent in this one for a warranty replacement. Why would I buy another one, then pay for shipping for this one to be returned to their CA offices just to get a replacement? What a complete load of bullsh**!!!!<br /><br />I am very seriously considering never buying another Cooler Master product strictly on the bullsh** I had to go through to get this faulty fan replaced. 2-year warranty my rear-end!! The warranty is basically worthless on this device. The only thing that will go bad on it is the fan and you are better off buying a fan from somewhere else than trying to deal with their \\"warranty\\" on it.<br /><br />Their \\"warranty\\" is the only reason I took a star off. I just wish the fan was better to begin with and wouldn't start rattling out of the blue like mine did!
B00A7OJ0DC|2.0|Movie is great, but paying $28 for it and having to jump through hoops inserting an asinine verification disc in order to enter the \\"Magic Code\\" for iTunes Digital Copy to find out it's not in HD.... just grinds my gears. I honestly would have not bought it for that much if I had known. I enjoy movies with included HD digital copies because with my Apple TV I will always have a watchable version for the future and in the cloud for easy access. Sorry to sound like a jerk, but this isn't the 90's Disney. The Blu-Ray is gorgeous though, and I would rate the movie an 8/10.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|high quality sound options, timer, and variety of choices.  best sound app to date.  be that it is free is a bonus as well!

B0055PMURG|5.0|I was right there with them through the whole movie.  What a brave<br />and courageous person Bethany is. I would recommend this movie.
B001DTUU7A|4.0|very good movie that works on many levels as a moral lesson,a comedy in its own right and as a visual entertainment<br /><br />also asks and partly answers that nagging question we all ask ourselves.....what if our planet is actually a speck of dust on a giants butt,and what happens if he scratches it?<br /><br />scary......
B00820N2JG|2.0|Good thing that I got to watch this for free.  This is defiantly a situation that you get what you pay for. The screen writer could of done better and still be funny.
B002X3V4P2|4.0|I bought this album because it was super cheap.  I like several Enya songs, but most of these I had never heard before.  I wonder how these are the greatest hits.  How many actual hits does she have anyways???  Anyways, its all very pretty and I'm glad I bought it.  I look forward to hearing all the new songs!
B003FAJTOA|5.0|This movie is a classic.  The story is great and the filming is outstanding.  Everyone should see this show at least once. It does have sub-titles and that forces you to watch the show closely.
B009FXIICK|2.0|I just don't like it.  Not my kind of game.  This is annoying for me to look at.  I deleted it within one minute of opening it.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I believe this is the best paranormal show on TV.  I have watched Sam and Dean grow up before my very eyes and they have developed into such GREAT actors.  I can't wait for next season!!
0812981448|5.0|Found the book enjoyable to read.  The stories were very interesting and believable.  Gives you lots to think about.  Wish that was my story.
0061122416|3.0|Good:<br />It was a lovely little light tale that fed my imagination and held my interest.<br /><br />Bad:<br />The whole thing felt like the author was trying to hard to weave this inspiring tale.<br />It came off as preachy and contrived in my opinion.
1577314808|5.0|I read this book and it changed my outlook drastically and for the better!  No more fretting over the past which I cannot change, but rather a new focus on the NOW and the Life I CAN change... and enjoy!  This book is a key part of a beginning of a new life for me and I still refer to it from time to time.  It's powerful!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|If I were in high school this book would have helped me out a lot.  I didn't know what path I should take had no confidence and balls like Charlie.  Great read though.<br /><br />Hakusyo
B0087IT8LO|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and it is excellent. It was very easy to follow and had all aspects a great movie should have: humor, drama, action, suspense, and romance.  The friendship that grew between these 2 men was beautiful and extremely well captured.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read a lot of life after death experiences. This was most interesting to me because I also had spinal meningitis.
0763644765|4.0|I purchased three books for my grandson's potty training and they were all good and explained things at a kids level which helped make the training an pleasant experience!  Keeps them busy while on the potty!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|This is funny - but a bit over the top. Fun connections to Boston and as always I love Mark Wahlberg.
0307887448|5.0|This is one of the best books I read in 2012. It has characters you can care about, a very compelling plot, and the setting is amazing: in a dystopian future in which many escape reality through a sensory-immersion video game, a regular kid battles an evil corporation.<br />For readers born in the 70's or 80's, this book has another great feature - the characters' obsession with 1980's culture (including music, TV, movies, and video games) will take you back! There are even mysteries that can be deduced with sufficient knowledge.<br />Would I recommend this book to someone younger, or someone who was not already interested in 80's pop-culture? Yes, I believe that the story is good enough to appeal to a wide range of audiences.<br /><br />I think this would make a great movie. Hopefully I'll see it come out in the next couple years!
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|The \\"new\\" single, \\"Somewhere\\", has spawned many a new listener and is sure to continue securing Hendrix's legend. It's also pretty fine stuff. But too much of this is just more barrel scrappings from the now questionable rightful owner of the greatest guitarist's catalogue. The danger lies in doing his legacy a disservice. There's even more flesh on the sonic bones of \\"Hear My Train A Comin\\" on \\"Valleys of Neptune\\" and that overall release was nothing special. The groove to \\"Izabella\\" drags. \\"Villanova Junction Blues\\" is so fragmentary that even Jimi's substantial credentials keep it rudderless. The electrofunk of \\"Mojo Man\\" goes unfulfilled. Though Jimi's stint with the Isley Brothers does his rhythm playing some good on this cut, Ghetto Fighter Albert Allen is way too generic a singer to pull this off. Still, there are a few successes. The often forgotten \\"Earth Blues\\" is the Band of Gypsys in truth and it has a force of its own. Instead of the Ronettes,  Billy Cox and Buddy Miles provide the vocal support. Arguably, this version has more heft than the original release. The other two that work are instrumentals. \\"Easy Blues\\", originally in abbreviated form on \\"Nine to the Universe\\" in 1980, demonstrates how Mitch Mitchell's jazz style of drumming brought Hendrix out at his improvisational best. The other, \\"Inside Out\\", is an intersting duo between Hendrix (overdubbing on bass) and Mitch Mitchell. He's mapping out the structure that would later become \\"Ezy Ryder\\". And, as possessor of one of rock's greatest falsettos, \\"Crash Landing\\" is worth some listening time.<br /><br />My overall disappointment in this product is not geared towards Jimi in the least because the evidence of most of this music suggests that Hendrix was in tune with his stronger compositional instincts. It's just that there seems so little care from the current administration in separating the wheat from the chaff. Historically, Eddie Kramer had been essential to Jimi's musical output. Now one has to wonder is he really good for Jimi's studio releases anymore? In practically every case, there are superior versions to be heard live and in the studio. I did read somewhere that this might be the last of the studio stuff released. I hope. All that's really needed is the Royal Albert Hall Concert on DVD/CD. If Janie can accomplish that feat, then maybe her stepbrother's legacy will be less blemished. And that would make for a happy ending because that would most likely garner five stars.s to wonder is he really good for Jimi's studio releases anymore?

B0035JRVR8|5.0|Love this movie! What a great pair. If you are a fan of either Audrey or Gregory it's a to see movie.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|The books were great. The movies were just as good. I am sorry to see this series end. I hope the author writes more about the different characters in the books
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Glad it's a simple calculator with big buttons. Makes it very convenient when I use it on my kindle fire hd.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|This show was recommended by a friend so i obligingly watched it. I enjoyed it more that i thought it would. With an &#34;X-filesy&#34; vibe, it was the perfect mix of paranormal fantasy, save the earth suspense, and enough twists to hold my attention... something that even Adderall can't do sometimes!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great price for 3 of the greatest movies. . . In blueray!!!!! Even comes with a collector booklet with some cool pix and interesting facts! Hubby loved it for Valentines Day!
0547884591|5.0|Because Tim Ferris is, usually, awesome. You should buy it, it's a guide to learn anything. Really, really useful. And inspiring too.
B009GESJH2|3.0|I'm a die-hard fan and will buy anything of his. This album focuses more on his &#34;southern side&#34; and not the rapper from the Motor City.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This is a splendid fantasy epic with all of the things that make fantasy stories grand- swords, sorcerers, magic and derring-do. The young hero, Thor, is more than the simple country bumpkin he first appears to be. Armed with only courage and the deep desire to join in his king's Legion, Thor runs away from home to find his destiny, never knowing how different from the rest of his family he really is.<br />I won't do a book report or give any spoilers but rest assured- if you like lots of action, and intricate story lines, magical creatures, and horrifying monsters, knights in armor and royal intrigue- this book is for you.<br /><br />Positives- This book has wonderful pacing, really good descriptive passages, and outstanding character build-up. It has has some very nice twists and turns... who would YOU trust in a royal court, when almost everyone you meet is either out for blood or some sort of political gain? Well done, Ms Rice- I WILL buy the rest of this series because I truly care about what happens to young Thor.<br /><br />Negatives- there are quite a few spelling errors and typos, which are all the more disturbing since the rest of the novel is so darned good. I don't know whether this book is self-pubbed or through a publisher, but the book really need a second set of eyes to spot these annoying nits, since they diminish the book's quality. (These are silly things like woulds, instead of woods--- or foul rather than fowl)<br /><br />This highly accomplished author does herself, and her readers, a disservice by not dropping the book for a day, or so, while the novel undergoes a final polish.<br /><br />The positives far outweigh the negatives however, and I applaud Rice's new addition to the fantasy field. Highly recommended!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had a lot of twist and turns in it that I never saw coming.  In the beginning it was a little slow, but after the first few chapters it really takes off and holds your interest.  This is the first book I have ready by Gillian Flynn, and I plan to read more of her books after reading Gone Girl.<br />Diane Burdorf
6305212112|5.0|This was clearly a &#34;chick flick&#34;, with loads of pathos and humor. The story lineswere well blended and the various characters were very well portrayed. An amazing cast and story that speaks across all age lines. Highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|There are a lot of ads but they are quick and easy to navigate away from. Very fun game to play.
B00001U0E1|5.0|This is the top of the line, as far as I'm concerned. We get well developed characters and plot line and lots of campy humor. And there is &#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34; thrown in for good measure. The actors are so well cast and play their parts to the hilt, without being over the top. Small wonder it won so many Oscars.
B0030G2ZRW|5.0|I loved this product it took me back, way back. Got  to be there is one of my all time favorites
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Ted was funny for about 10 minutes. The rest of it is childish fart jokes, drug abuse, and swearing. It had potential that it never lived up to, because it was too busy dumbing itself down for the 15 year old boy crowd. There were a few chuckles, but just about every other joke fell flat. The corporate sponsorships were blatant. Mark was just sleepwalking through the entire picture, and the female lead just stood there looking pretty with a deadpan expression most of the time. Skip it.
B0017SV1OI|5.0|Just love APP ..  glad I was able to relocate a copy to listen in car while stuck in traffic
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Over all it's a pretty good game. Great graphics and runs really smooth on my kindle fire. Only problem I've come across is all of a sudden today there has been an advertisement after every single move you do on it. Now I understand it's a free game and they gotta make their money but really??? After EVERY move??? Remember guys you make money from in game purchases too and if you make it unplayable like this how are you gonna make anything at all? Food for thought to the developers I guess.
B00821OX98|2.0|there might be some interesting story ideas here, but this show has every bad thing about TV that I'm not wiling to put up with anymore. Watched the first couple of episodes, couldn't bear to watch further. Your mileage may vary.
B007FY9ZWI|4.0|it is better than what came with the android system ,the app runs smoothly and more options and less buggy
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I always wanted to read the bible and this is a great way it even can be read to me when I am doing something else I love this book
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I can't believe it's over, I wish it didn't have to end. This book has elements of true love, comedy and realism. I loved it!
B00005MK9Y|5.0|I'm a pretty huge Bob Marley fan and for whatever reason had never heard this disc and did not have it in my collection. This was so great to listen to I almost shed tears of joy! There are some different things in songs that you've heard 100's of times that are simply incredible. The guitar work is outstanding throughout. From start to finish this disc explodes and ranks up there with any live Marley ever captured. I still can't believe I never heard this until yesterday. This is a must for any Marley fan!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|They could work out a few tweaks, but I can't believe it's free!!!! The graphics are amazing!!! A must have, but what would be cool is if they could change cloths!!!
B001F7EZ9Y|5.0|This album is a creeper to the point that I initially discarded it but then after a few listens thought it to be solid, and then, after hearing the immaculate double vinyl, I am completely blown away. AC/DC has been on quite a roll. I think they have never even put out less than a 3-3.5 star album and I feel Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip were both incredibly strong. It is still difficlut for me to pick a better one out of the three (i would lean toward Ballbreaker) but Black Ice really is an incredible achievement. You owe it to yourself to hear the vinyl version of this if at all possible. It really does destroy the CD in terms of overall power and dynamic range! Favortie tracks include Rock N Roll Train (great opener), Rock N Roll Dream, Spoilin For a Fight, Stormy May Day, and of course the brutal closer Black Ice. Brian Johnson sounds incredible on this!
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|I love this book ,I can't stop my self from reading this book until nine oclock .I get in trouble for  staying up too late. I finished this book in 1 week.It's sutch athriller
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|this game is cool kinda. easy game not hard at all. I wished that I could get it on my computer too... one thing I do hate is this 20 word crape.
B003O86FMW|5.0|BEST book Ever the ending made me want to scream I wonder what happens next...???<br />I love the hunger games
0802473156|5.0|I love this book it was a great book! I think every couple should read it!!! I am now reading the 5 love languages of Children.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the most realistic horse game ever. It's never blurry and the graphics are amazing. It always loads and I love how it has different challenges to complete. When my friends look over at my horse when I play they don't think much of it. I say &quot;it's a horse lover thing&quot; Game is great for all ages. If you are older than 10 you must be a horse lover to adore the game. I play it every day and I'm only 13! Also if you download it, add me as a friend at barrelhorze. This game is AWESOME!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;
B00APUYWYA|3.0|This movie is basically a mash-up of the movie Bring It On and Glee. New girl, new school, auditions, and competitions. Loved this movie, Anna Kendrick was great!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I had not read this book until after the movie was produced, and I wanted to read it before seeing the movie.  I was GREATLY rewarded.  The descriptive passages, both of animal behavior and the power and solitude of the sea, are most memorable, moving and exciting.  The portrait of the bengal tiger, Richard Parker, is unforgettable.  The island is a masterpiece of imagination.  in all, highly recommended!
0307950654|5.0|Death Comes to Pemberly has  the feel of a genuine Jane Austen novel.  Loved it!  Highly recommended for Jane Austen fans.
B0014LX420|3.0|I just bought this for some upbeat workout music.  It serves its purpose but is not outstanding by any means.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite Pixar movies and I am so glad my 22-month old loves it too. We travel on planes A LOT and Cars is the best travel buddy a patent can ask for. The lack of violence and bad language really appealed to me when I was deciding whether I wanted my son to start watching movies. The creativity Pixar added to this &#34;car world&#34;, the secret adult humor, and the lessons you take from the movie (teamwork, unselfishness, knowing what is more important than just winning) make this movie a winner.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie and I don't mind watching it every time we do!
B000HL0EEE|4.0|This first season is a great start as it dedicates one episode to each major character so we get to know their backstory and personality for future episodes.  It's interesting how they work in aspects that alude to future concepts that are key to the later franchises (ie: reason for the Prime Directive)<br /><br />I'm enjoying this a lot more than I expected.<br /><br />Of course, if you're not really into Star Trek, this may not work for you, but it's fun television and well constructed stories and characters
B00335EQ0E|1.0|Am currently returning my second package - each includes the main feature DVD and a bonus material DVD. The main feature will not load on any of my three DVD players, however the bonus DVD will play just fine. Returned set #1 and received set #2 ... same problem. Won't be seeking a replacement. Amazon's return process is very easy, however.
0316228532|5.0|It must have taken J.K. Rawling a lot of courage to write this book, and a lot of courage of the publisher too!<br />In this little town somewhere in England there's hardly one character one can like. They are miserable, pompous asses, liars, drug addicts, thieves, adulteres . . .and yet, I could hardly put the book down, and at the end I liked most of them!<br />What I still don't understand is what kind of magic Rawlin has weaved to make this happen. But that she has done, and I sincerely hope she's writing another one, just as fascinating as this one!
B004MYF4SS|5.0|I did like the story very much. Peter May did a great job describing the isolation on the Hebrides and growing up there.<br />The storyline kept me on the edge of my seat.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Great price for a great product. Simple to use, protects the Kindle and looks good. Not bullet proof but who cares.
B0045ZAQSM|5.0|I grew up in Germany for the first few years of my life and have gone back regularly. Its always hard to find a good German film thats not only funny but tells a good story. Soul Kitchen however does just that, it makes me want to cry but laugh the whole way through. This is a must must buy for any film lover of international film  or even other Germans out their wanting to see a great film. Think Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares but in a German light comedy.
0061537969|5.0|How can you not like this book?  The story is heartlifting and heartwrenching...and comes full circle!  Love it, love it!
B000FC0ZAI|4.0|But good nonetheless.  It reminded my of some of John Irving's work, . Though I bought this book thinking I was getting something else, I was not disappointed.  In fact, I plan on reading other novels from Liam Callanan.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|If you didn't like Steve Jobs before reading this book, you probably won't like him much more after you read it. But you will be given an insider's view of a man who changed how  nearly everyone in the modern world lives. Music devices, phones and computers would never be the same after Steve Jobs put his creative mind to work on making all of these devices a part of everyday life. And the story in fascinating. This is one of the best written bio's I've ever read.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I love flowers and the story that went with the definations was great. Good read for everone, learned something  about my favorite flowers.
B006HL9G10|5.0|This is a great app for meditation or those just looking for a nice sound for a timer. i use it for meditation, for cooking, and for other activities requiring some kind of time limit. Several different chime offerings, plus a choice of one, two, or three bells, a pre-meditation bell to begin, interval timer bells, and a journal feature as well. Lots of really good features for an incredibly low price. Compared to the $100 timer I received for Christmas a few years ago, this does more and sounds better! I love it and use it daily!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|sweet and sad and happy it played on all of my emotions! Kudos to the Author! i loved it!!! Bravo!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I think that this app is ok. it wastes time. I would much rather ride my own horses than play stupid games but its winter and I have nothing else to do right now.
B008NR8YTQ|3.0|Gary Moore's playing is a close duplication of Jimi Hendrix's sound, which is difficult<br />to master because of JImi's unique style. The CD takes off with the help of Billy Cox<br />and Mitch Mitchell supplying the rythmn beneath Gary's guitar.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|We have Ben the Dog application and couldn't resist punching this kitty and making him purr too!  Adorable for kids and adults.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Continuação legal no geral, mas no final deixam muito descaradamente que e necessária outra continuação.... Isso só demonstra I interesse mercadologico do atuou! Pena!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm addicted to Pinterest so having this easy app on my phone is pure joy for me.  LOVE IT!  Thank you!
B0041D843M|5.0|This is an amazing book for being able to explain why we need to change our way of thinking about our diet. Best factual book about health that I have ever read - most are just someone's opinion - and the facts are there in 'black & white'.
B000N0W9WO|5.0|I wanted to add this to my bluray collection.The movie arrived promptly, in great condition  and has worked great for me. It plays great.
0151003084|4.0|It is an entertaining little book with pictures and rhymes, but it is little. It is only as long as the alphabet.
B00913DPW2|1.0|There is no skip for the puzzles and there is at least one that I could not pass even with a walkthrough. The puzzles are just too sensitive for touch screen.
B006903GX8|5.0|For Downton Abbey addicts like myself, this is the ultimate way to gorge yourself. It's all you wanted to know historically about the British Aristocracy at this time, the Buccaneers and who they were, and the culture of being &#34;in service&#34; in that day and age, as well as how all the Crawleys, their relatives, and their servants fit into this class system.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was written well and compelling.  Hope she writes more novels.  A friend suggested it and I could not put it down.
B00280LYIM|5.0|It is one of the best books ever in this book you meat Rachel Elizabeth<br /> Dare from book 3 and. It is just a really good book you have to read it for yourself
B004UQPM4E|5.0|I purchased from Amazon and got the US version. This is a great box set, and the quality of the movies look and sound great on blu-ray and an HD flat panel.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Season 2 has not been a disappointment to me.  I think it has to some but it's nice to see the characters be able to &#34;relax&#34; a little even if for a minute or two
B004XZR63M|5.0|Loved this book - gets you thinking about possibilities and the importance of financial intelligence<br /><br />This is my second time reading and definitely not the last time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Enjoying the new season. I think, at this time, there is one more episode to go for this season. Even so, it's been a really great season!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was a cute movie about embracing who you are and realizing your full potential! I recommend it for a nice Saturday afternoon or rainy day movie!
B0049VZ222|5.0|I was so excited to find this on AMC but disappointed that all I was able to watch was the first episode.  Enter Amazon Instant Video!!<br />Bought the entire season and enjoyed every second of it
B007N85POS|4.0|Cute animation and fun, it also gives you a brain work out to figure what angles you want to use to break away the poor imprisoned tropical birds. The pineapples do something although I have not gathered enough of them to know what but I am sure it is good!  I like it to play now and then.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I love kids movies. I love well done kids movies. I have so much fun watching Ice Age, I'm surprised it hasn't evolved into a tv series, although I'm glad it hasn't
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a great game for all the family, it teaches responsibility and how to reach goals, and it is fun.  Most of all the animation is just highly sophisticated, the motion is very good and i wish i knew how they did it ~~~ Kudo's and thanks to the makers!!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The meaning of the flowers consult again & again throughout the book-made me want to learn more- i want to read more by this author
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Really enjoyed it. Suspenseful, entertaining, interesting plot, very well made.  Definitely deserved the best picture oscar award! Go see it.
B00913DPW2|4.0|This game was quite challenging even with the online help.  Graphics were good and storyline was consistent all the way through.  One of the puzzles I couldn't figure out even with the online help, luckily the game does have a &#34;skip puzzle&#34; option accessible through the &#34;game options&#34; tab on the main screen.  I would recommend this game for most kids ages 10 and up.
B0045XICB2|3.0|this was part of the series so i figured I needed it too I have read the books and this movie is cheesy
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it's k but bad I mean Bad graphics and chareters  make this be helpful im Justin bieber baby, around the world
B00190OHD6|4.0|Love this movie, its a great love story and gives you great ideas if this were to happen to me
B007D5E7C2|5.0|This double feature was a great deal! I paid a very low price for this Kill Bill box set, and would absolutely recommend it to anyone who enjoys films by Quentin Tarantino.<br /><br />Great product.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day reminds you to stop and thank a soldier for what they do. They are what America stands for, sacrifice and dedication.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and totally addictive. When u r playin yo eyes off it or u will crash an lose . ;) Yours truly, Cautiaira
B009JZWO3I|5.0|As usual the show delivers an enjoyable hour when i travel I watch on my Kindle even in Europe to catch up on missed shows
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits Season 1 was very good, but Season 2 by far exceeds it.  The episodes are thoughtful and well-acted.  This is the kind of series that you can watch more than once and still enjoy.  You can tell the actors enjoy their characters and have a chemistry between themselves.<br /><br />I'm also getting to appreciate Amazon video more.  I like being able to stream to different devices when it is convenient for me.  I also like getting great video quality even if the bandwidth of my current internet connection isn't that great.  Suits Season 2 plus Amazon Video = great combination.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|This was a replacement purchase, so knew what to expect. But none the less pleased with CD and service I received.
B002B3W3TU|5.0|About 40 years ago I first heard this album as a teenager, entranced by the lyrics, country influences and string arrangements on some of the songs.Sitting in a hospital, I downloaded it to raise my spirits and I wasn't disappointed. Neil Young's ability to modulate his voice for the style or mode of the song is amazing. Great guitar. Creative sixties music at its best!
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I kept working one puzzle after another until I realized I'd been playing for over an hour.  No problems yet.
B000VSBX34|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie growing up.  Introduced it to our kids, and they now love it, too!  My daughter (from this movie) has become a Beatles fan.  She now doesn't like today's music, and prefers to hear Beatles.  My son is not as dramatic in his liking the Beatles (though he does enjoy their music), but he now likes listening to music from the 70's to the 90's, and doesn't care for today's music.  They love the fun and silliness of this movie, and no vulgarity!
B006VREHRS|5.0|Not only is Boardwalk smart...subtle..lush...reserved...and whimsical..it is bawdy, sinister and dangerous!  I love it!!  And I am only on season one!
B00873GRU4|5.0|A totally believable futuristic setting - great example of world building - offset the main characters' attempt to solve a mystery and in turn unfurl the many secrets of their somewhat twisted society. Fantastic story. Recommend to all. Even those who don't read scifi/speculative fiction.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Was not sure of the topic but boy what an eye opener to a world assumed but perhaps, lacking full understanding. I cried, prayed, laughed, and deeply enjoyed each story in the season...
055358894X|5.0|This set of books is among my favorites. Wonderful author, I'm very happy a friend suggested him. I look forward to a fourth in the series.
034580404X|4.0|I liked the first book but have not had time to sit down and read the second one yet.<br />It is good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition totally rocks .It was every cent I cant think of a better mine fretted game than<br />this I have fun playing it with my sister and my 2 brothers this game is awesome the only thing that would make it better would be spawners and horse mode otherwise its the best app ever I love it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  It kept me guessing the whole time and I love the surprises that you will never figure out. Perfect!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|In Nicholas Sparks fashion this book truly is a wonderful read.  The story is so compelling you hear about spousal abuse, but with Sparks writing your heart is pulled in almost from the beginning.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|The series is well written and has a lot of detail about the characters and what is happening in their lives.  I enjoy the pace of it too.

B007N8RULO|4.0|This is a very addictive game.. only reason four stars bate the ads.... but still fun! I would recommend it....
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought this series was even hotter than 50 Shades of Grey - same type of story but such a good and easy read.  Good characters and hot sex - what more can you ask for??
B004FRX0MY|2.0|It does not work on my kindle... so I don't use it at all.... I use my cellphone instead of kindle and amazon mp3.

B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Fantastic book, great start, towards the end it wraps up quickly as if the editor said the real ending was too long!
B009FZFONO|5.0|The Walking Dead series is one of the best ever. Every episode is filled with action and suspense. It's hard to stop watching once you start.
B008602KQI|3.0|This book was entertaining but I would not call it anything more than that. If you want something to read that does not take long this book would be it.
B00022LRXA|3.0|This album is really good. Excellent keyboards and compositions, entertaining lyrics. Not exactly my cup of tea, and side 2 bores me.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This book was great. It was filled with a lot of adventure, and was very exciting. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time👍👍👍👍
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing! I am a huge horse lover and rider/owner and i think this game is a must play!
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|You do not need me to tell you whether you like this style of music or not - If that sort of review is what you seek, I'll let other folks handle that (though I 5-starred it because I happen to love it) Instead let me suggest to you what you'll want to do to get the most out of trying this album out, because if you are a Trent Reznor fan we pretty well know you are gong to just buy it whether the reviews are good or not.<br /><br />1: A great soundsystem, or a nice pair of headphones. This album is the cutting edge of modern instrumentation and you WILL miss the stuff that makes or breaks this album if you do not have a good setup to capture its depth.<br /><br />2: Focus and patience. Treat this album like going to the symphony or opera rather than going to a stadium concert. Make time for it, and let it sink in rather than just hoping the next song is going to be the one to headbang to - because it is not coming. There is some remarkable stuff happening here you will not hear anywhere by any other artists. Let them lead you to it.<br /><br />3: Repeated listens. Do not let the minimalism of songs like Ice Age fool you into thinking the album lacks complexity or a payoff. It isn't just about the tunes with this album, it is about the way the instruments are played or mixed. The softness vs hardness of notes, the loud and the quiet, the atmosphere that is created. This album has a multi-layered texture that is a different way to listen to music than pop music has taught us to recognize.<br /><br />4: Don't expect Mariqueen to sing like or write like Trent. If you do not like her, that is all subjective and your choice. All I am saying is keep an open mind before deciding because if it was meant to sound like NIN, it'd be a NIN album.<br /><br />I definitely get why this music seems daunting or falls short in the opinions of other people's reviews. I felt the same on my first listen of AN OMEN. But as I got acquainted with that record I realized its goals and what tohunt for wiith future releases, and I hope my sharing makes it easier for you to appreciate whats here.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show. It draws you in so that you just can't wait for the next episode. Highly recommended.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Great book! A believable perspective from a very mentally disturbed man's mind. Love the way it is written, love how it was spoken to the reader.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Our entire family--ages 9 to 51--loved this film. Gerard Butler's performance as Frosty made him wise and real, and the story of a how a good kid becomes an extraordinary surfer and young man was truly moving. It's more about growing up than surfing, but there's plenty of amazing footage of that, too. Highly recommended.
B00A5052YE|5.0|I like the album, but I love Listen To Your Heart and 101 the most! A New Day is a catchy song.
B0011E9LBI|5.0|I have always loved the MIB movies and lost my first copy of this movies so I had to get another one.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|THIS APP IS THE BEST POSSIBLE!<br />If you play rock paper sisers you would be sisers and this app would rock.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|littlest pet shop is a fun game but I think it needs to be a little more challenge Luke the wii versing that one is fun to play and is not to complacated so this game is still awesome.
B000V6583C|5.0|I have been listening to this album since its release date and it still remains timeless in it's late 80's raw heavy rock style.  Welcome to the Jungle and Sweet Child O' Mine will always be classics.  If you like any of GnR's music, this is a must have album.  Enjoy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|They story line jumping back and fourth threw charters is very addictive, really kept me on my toes wanting to read more. I couldn't get enough of it.
0143120530|3.0|This is not so much a how to book than it is a story about Joshua's journey.  I was hoping for more instructions on how to better remember things and there is some in the book but not enough to justify buying it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Best book ever i at first i was being punished to read this book but in fact it was one actually it was the best book i have ever read
B002SRQ214|5.0|It had great specs for its price and was an amazing upgrade from what I had before, the chip dropped right in. The heat-sink had its own compound on it so you do not have to buy your own and the heat-sink clipped right onto the old brace I had so that is another item you do not have to buy. All in all it was a great buy for those looking to get up to speed without breaking the bank.<br /><br />However not 24 hours after installing it a pin burns a hole into my mobo's processor slot. I unfortunately received a defective model and I am sure it is no ones liability to replace my mobo now that it has a hole in it... but a replacement will be sent at least for my have-to-now new mobo.
B004I744AS|3.0|Found the app very easy to navigate. My only wish is that I would like to see more in depth definitions. In all fairness it did work well for my purposes ( college English 100)
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|My 6 year old love this game! Even without playing the actual game, he just loves to build towers with it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game because you get to take care of your horse and you get to play the game.
B000S1LUE6|5.0|My husband & I taught singles from the original 5 Love Languages but this singles version is SO MUCH BETTER to really get the point across!  AWESOME stories to illustrate the concepts!  Our students always tell us this is their FAV class of the year b/c it helps them w/ relationships w/ parents, siblings, roommates & eventually their future spouses!!
B00APUQT7I|1.0|I never saw it spent hours trying but it would not open. Video online stink does not work.I will never fool with again.  Tried twice two different
B009MO57H6|3.0|I was very disappointed in this DVD movie. The previous movies of Resident Evil were much better.There was nothing exciting about this movie at all. They could have done better. I like Milla Jovovich and consider her to be a good actress and she did her part in this movie, I am happy to say. I would not recommend this movie. It is a waste of time.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|I actually really like this game.  It's a bit &#34;old school&#34; in the graphics and gameplay, which I also like.  The controls, I used the tilt controls work very well, pretty realistic actually.  So far it's the only racing game I've been able to control at all.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love Downton Abbey Season 3. This show stopper never disappoints me. There is always some unexpected event that just keeps me waiting for the next season of the show. I am happy when all is well and sad when things go badly. All of the characters are<br />fascinating as they interact with each other. Maggie Smith is my favorite actress in the show. I will watch anything that she stars in<br />because she always gives a great performance and never disappoints me. I love her dearly. I cannot wait for season 4 to begin! I<br />have watched Season 3  three times already.
B008B92U32|4.0|I've taken tons of pics with a couple of us just hanging out and this app made it pretty easy to swap faces.  I've had a lot of fun, sometimes it's better to leave a person's face on that person though!  I have had no problem with crashes or anything on a Razr Maxx.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|UPDATE: August 23,2014- BEST TIME SAVER, ORGANIZER & SAFETY MONITOR FOR ALL MY TECH DEVICES! I NEVER get someplace and discover my battery is dead because this app won't let me. It monitors my battery usage and level AND warns me if my battery is running low or getting too hot-It even reminds me when I need to charge my battery so I'll be able to  use my devices when I'm away from home.  It's dependable,accurate and truly the best protection I have on my phonse,Kindle and tablets. After using this app for more than 3 years it gets an A+ & 5*'s!  GET THIS APP-YOU'LL NEVER REGRET IT! :)<br /><br />2013-I accidently found Battery HD when looking for a battery life extender-it never even dawned on me there could be an app like this and NOW-I COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT IT!  I have it on all my battery operated devices: phones, Kindle reader & Kindle Fire.  It so frees up my time because this app tells me where my battery is at, if I need to charge it or if I have enough charge for whatever I'm doing...and a slew of other helpful things.  I never get stuck  someplace with a dead phone anymore.  What a wonderful stresser to have removed from my life.  That's why I bought the pro version, not because the free version was lacking anything, (it wasn't), but because the developers gave me for free,( that's for everybody, not just me-the basic is totally free AND NOT for just a few days trial either!), such a wonderful app, I wanted to give back to them.  Hopefully helping them get a pay check will also encourage them to invent & discover new great, wonderfully helpful apps.  I am on a tight budget and don't spend my money easily but this people need to be shown their appreciated.  You will love<br />this app.  It offers voice and/or sound reminders, YOU pick when and how many reminders you get and there is so much more.  A beautiful graph for tracking both battery use and charging time, tells you how long you can do many things with the charge left in your device, the option to see your battery's level in many ways and really so much more.  Check it out for your self, I believe you'll be very glad you did.<br />Oh, there is one other feature I must mention and that is how easy this app is to use.  I am NOT computer savvy and  have had to uninstall a large number of 'battery savers\\" because I just couldn't figure them out and was messingup my phone.  A very large number so that's just one more reason this app is worth 5 stars AND BEYOND!e your battery's level in many ways and really so much more.

068817776X|4.0|This book was incredible. It actually was very difficult to get through the first 10-15% of the book because of all the German names and cities and all of that kinda lost me a little bit. I almost stopped reading it altogether and just paperbackswapped it, but I decided to give it a chance. I am so glad I did! Some books just have a way of touching you so deeply, you feel like you were right there with the person. You feel the same love they do, the same fear, and even the same hatred that they feel. This, for me, was one of those books. I really enjoyed the way it was written as if she was actually talking to you, as if she was speaking to a friend.<br /><br />Edith Hahn was a Jewish girl when Nazi Germany was coming to power. Nazis stole everything that the Jewish people owned, from their prized to possessions to their homes and their businesses. Those people who weren't robbed of their possessions would be arrested, tortured for weeks, and released, and upon their release they would be more than happy to give everything up to the Nazis if they would be allowed to flee the country. After Edith's house and anything of worth was taken from her family not to mention she was one test away from finishing her law degree when they told her that the Jews were no longer welcome at the school) and they were forced to live in a cramped place in the Viennese ghetto, Edith was selected to go to a work camp (which was supposed to last 6 weeks, but instead was years) where she forced to do back-breaking work with very little food to keep her going. Meanwhile, back in Vienna and all over, Jews are being sent to Poland to live in the already overcrowded ghettos there. I won't go into all the details, but when she finally comes back to Vienna she is supposed to report for her transport to Poland, but instead with the help of a few friendly, well connected Germans she is able to go underground and reemerge with a new identity, so long as she leaves Vienna. She moves to Munich, where she pretends to be an Aryan girl and eventually marries a man who becomes a Nazi officer toward the end of the war (hence the title.)<br /><br />I can't imagine what it must have felt like to have to hear the Germans talk about Hitler and how wonderful he was and she would have to agree so that she didn't draw attention to herself. What I find very interesting is that she had no idea that the Jewish people were being murdered by the hundreds, if not thousands, every day. Now that I have read this, a memoir about a wanted Jewish girl hiding in plain sight of the Germans, I would like to read a memoir about someone who actually had been sent to the concentration camps (I may try to read &#34;Night&#34; by Elie Wiesel again), also a memoir about a Jewish person who stayed in hiding, and also a memoir about a French prisoner in the work camps. I have been interested in WWII and the Holocaust since reading &#34;Night&#34; for 9th grade Advanced English and I would like to see all of the different perspectives from the people who were treated so horribly.she pretends to be an Aryan girl and eventually marries a man who becomes a Nazi officer toward the end of the war (hence the title.)<br /><br />I can't imagine what it must have felt like to have to hear the Germans talk about Hitler and how wonderful he was and she would have to agree so that she didn't draw attention to herself.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Not only do fingers and brain respond, but so does my sense of humor.  This is a fun diversion and that's my word limit!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Can't wait for Book Three!  Ken Follett is a master in creating historical fiction...love the characters, the descriptions, everything!  Am reading another of his novels now...again, another great book!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I've been reading science fiction for almost 50 years and have all too rarely found a book that was impossible to put down.  Happily, this is one falls into that category.
B0043UB0BQ|5.0|This series is intense. The men on here are gorgeous. It's a must see. Love it. Can't wait to purchase and view the second season.
0425252868|5.0|\\"My brother, Ist Lt. Thomas Ksanznak,was a P-51 fighter pilot stationed at Steeple Morden, England during WWII. I was very impressed with the accuracy and detailed description of the author, Adam Makos, in placing us in the cockpits of the American and German airplanes. These brave, courageous and valiant men are the real heroes and role models for our young people. We spend too much time placing our high salaried and pampered professional athletes on the national stage. After reading, \\"A Higher Call\\" you quickly realize who the real heroes are for our young people. As they say, there are three kinds of people: Those who watch things happen; Those who wonder what happen and Those who make things happen. WWII pilots, Charlie Brown and Franz Stigler made remarkable things happen as exceptional pilots and even more important as ethical and moral young men defending their countries during a time of war.\\"<br /><br />Larry Ksanznak<br />Oakland, New Jersey
B001BJNIIK|4.0|Just wanted to watch an old movie. I.watched when I was a kid. It was very nostalgic. It's funny how those two icons have gotten old
1118109791|5.0|I am a beginner in GMAT, and I find this book very helpful. It is very easy to understand and you can go through it without any tutor.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|There are songs on this CD that I had not listened to in many years! Brought back lots of great memories.
B00772M1F6|5.0|You really should see this refreshing lad live. But the album is a nice second. It's like a breath of fresh air in the dark catacombs of Rockabilly. It hasn't left my stereo and I suspect it will be there for a long time. I would highly recommend this one!
B008SOS63S|5.0|If you have never heard of this man or heard his music, this is a must have CD! Blues, rock and total Joe! He is a guitar genious!
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I really like this watch i've had it for a few months now and it works great. I love watches and this is one of my favorites i love the fact that ill never replace the battery.
0747586640|5.0|This was a great read. I found it very interesting and insightful. What a journey she went on! I'm kind of jealous!
B0015DROBO|5.0|While the translation can be somewhat difficult at times, I found the plain spoken almost cool confidence with which this is written to be refreshing an honest. A great mystery that has compelling characters and a plot that keeps you guessing, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|I can't think of a better prequel to the Alien. Just enough questions answered, and just enough left unanswered, in the true Alien spirit...
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My two year old loves this movie, we watch it at home and on the kindle when on the go he just can not get enough! Also great for adults!
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|From what I know about Alfred Hitchcock and his life, this movie was a well done, accurate depiction of his life during the making of Psycho. The movie focuses on his relationship with his wife, Alma, during the making of Psycho and the trials of being married to a genius. This movie isn't only great for insight into the life of Hitchcock, but for the insight into the lives of women in Hollywood at that time as well. Vera Miles ending up on Hitchcock's black list for, \\"choosing,\\" to start a family, or Alma being stuck in his shadows while being a brilliant filmmaker herself.<br /><br />Recommended watch, Anthony Hopkins all but disappears into his Hitchcock, just brilliant acting. Not an amazing movie, but a good one that's worth your time.
B007FIY3VW|3.0|this is not the greatest app ever as it is hard to highlight words when editing. It is also difficult to find files you save from your email.
B0064W652A|5.0|While not everyone will agree, this is one of my favorite Batman stories.  This came out while I was still collecting comics, and I waited on the edge of my seat for every new issue to arrive.  My friends and I had so much fun analyzing the story, and trying to figure out who would ultimately be revealed as Hush.  I hope that someday, DC will animate this story
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|First two seasons deserved a five. I just felt there were some dry spots in season 3. NOTHING of real interest happened in the finale until the last ten minutes. The episode was actually quite boring<br /> I LOVE the series, so overall I have to stay at four stars.
B000EGDB10|2.0|It was very amateurish in directorial style. The vault heist scene was the highlight.  If that was intentional, it was a success.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is very addicting. This game is so much fun.  A great way to kill time when you are waiting for an appointment.
B00003CXPD|5.0|It speaks to that sense of dreaming in all of us.  Very well done and Billy Elliot will live forever in many hearts.  Julie Walters is very engaging and moved the emotion forward.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I love this free app.  You can see the whole month and all of your appointment times at once.  I recommend this to all.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|This  is more work than it is worth and I don't have the free tme to take advantage of it's abilities
B009GEDP26|5.0|Love the story line and like the love story of Castle and Beckett. There's always humor.  The stories are never the same.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was the best book I have ever read .It was so exciting and thrilling I never knew what was going to happen next. I am surprised that everyone in the world has not read the book yet because it is that good.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Very intense movie. Once again a great performance by Denzel. I loved John Goodman's performance. I would highly recommend it!
