B007R41E8O|1.0|I really wish I could say I purchased this game, played it, and loved it. I would even settle for being able to say I purchased this game, played it, and hated it. Alas, the most I can say is that I purchased this game. As some other reviewers before me pointed out, there is additional content to download once the game has been purchased and delivered. 350mb doesn't seem like all that much when all's said and done, but it really moves along at a snail's pace on this game. I saw it moving slow and thought, \\"Well, I'll just have to wait a while.\\" However, the download froze. Twice. The first time, it got stuck at 43.7% for about half an hour. I removed the app from my Fire, downloaded it again, and started over. That time, it got stuck at 27.1% for roughly 10 minutes. Needless to say, I gave up and contacted Amazon for a refund.<br /><br />If they ever get the download issues sorted out, maybe purchasing it will be worth it. As it is, even if the game were free it wouldn't be worth the time and aggravation one has to endure trying to get it to work.

0312944926|4.0|Other reviewers have pointed out that the computer facts in Dan's book are mostly wrong. And there are other things, like the idea that all the country's secret files would be in one single database, and not otherwise backed up anywhere. That, in itself, is a preposterous idea!<br /><br />But I ignored the fact that Dan had some major flaws in his computer research (Dan's research is usually excellent), and that there were a few too many fallacies, and read the rest of the story, and it was good. Like all the Dan Brown books I've read, he gives you some plot twists you probably won't guess, he keeps you guessing about a lot of other stuff, and he has a complete ending. He's better than a lot of authors just for that!<br /><br />I was disappointed that Dan didn't get a cryptographer to help with the computer stuff, but I still liked the book, and I think you will too, if you can cut Dan a little slack on the inadequate research and suspend your disbelief a little.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is possibly the best book I have ever read. I am still amazed at how the author was able to tell a story with so many particular scientific peculiarities and the intricacies of the lives of the characters and balance them in a way that you are not bored by either, but rather excited by both. Rebecca is a fine writer and you should expect to learn as much as you may have jaw-dropping moments, as much as you might get upset and disgusted, as much as you will leave hopeful and encouraged by what you have read. I am happy that I saw the author on the Tavis Smiley show and got this book, I share it with everyone I meet now.
B007R3B4RG|4.0|The second and (from the sounds of reports) final solo from Joey Ramone is a solid and unlikely tribute to the late singer. From the liner notes, it also sounds like this was a tough record to release, with barbs at producer Daniel Rey for an &#34;eight year long tug of war&#34; over Joey's vocal tapes. Was the battle worth it? For us fans, heck yeah.<br /><br />&#34;Ya Know&#34; sounds like a half-ways decent Ramones album from the period after &#34;Too Tough To Die&#34; that began seeing them struggling with weaker material. Indeed, some of these songs might have spruced up the likes of &#34;Animal Boy&#34; or &#34;Brain Drain,&#34; as references seem to point to various gestation years. The most blatant is the Elton John cop in &#34;Rock and Roll is The Answer,&#34; the worst is the country weeper redo of &#34;Merry Christmas (I Don't Want to Fight Tonight).&#34; Given that these were all stapled together from home demos, the friends in attendance (Andy Shernoff of the Dictators, Jean Beauvoir of the Plasmatics, Joan Jett, Holly Vincent of Holly and The Italians and more), this sounds like a coherent, full album. Vincent's duet on the Phil Specter-like &#34;Party Line&#34; is a super standout, and &#34;New York City,&#34; which has an all-star cast behind Joey, is a love letter to NYC that rocks like the best of any Ramones platter.<br /><br />Some of the songs retain their demo quality, with La la's and Ba-ba's sounding like open spaces for unfinished lyrics (&#34;Make Me Tremble&#34;) and the closer, &#34;Life's a Gas&#34; is only really half a song. At the same time, when you hear the wind chimes that fade the song out and know that these were things in Joey's life that brought him peace, it's hard not to forgive the album's final handlers for giving us, as fans, everything that was left in the vaults. Almost as good as &#34;Don't Worry About Me&#34; and missing by a cover version (Joey's kicking version of &#34;Wonderful World&#34; on DWAM), &#34;Ya Know&#34; is everything a Ramones fan could expect. A rambling staggering piece of purity. Just like the guy himself.ones fan could expect. A rambling staggering piece of purity. Just like the guy himself.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|If there is ever a book that I can refer to that positively impacted my life, this would be it. It is unlike other self help books as you are forced to uncover a personal meaning of the story though it is not hidden at all. I am sure each person takes away something different from the book, but I am sure all the readers have left changed, inspired and empowered.
B003VBVQNA|4.0|Coming off the horn heavy funk of \\"Notorious,\\" Duran Duran the trio stripped the sound down to some heavy beats for \\"Big Thing.\\" The first single, \\"I Don't Want Your Love,\\" sounded like a re-invention. Incorporating the current house and new-jack dance trends at the time, it was a major leap away from the candy-floss of \\"Rio.\\" \\"All She Wants Is\\" carried the same sort of dance-floor urgency, and the title track was an arena ready thumper.<br /><br />But the trademark lushness wasn't ever too far off. \\"Too Late Marlene\\" and \\"Land\\" are everything you'd expect from Duran Duran, rich arrangements, Simon's grandiose lyrics and Nick Rhodes' atmospheric keyboards. But perhaps \\"Big Thing's\\" best moment is the tribute to the band's late friend Alex Sadkin, \\"Do You Believe In Shame.\\" Slowing down the swamp groove of \\"Suzie Q\\" and laying in an emotional vocal, \\"Shame\\" connects on a level that only a few songs in the DD library have ever done before. The remaster also brings out the nuance of these tow songs.<br /><br />The second disc is for serious collectors. Compiling many of the dance remixes and US single mixes of assorted songs, it's a hoot for collectors. (The double disc version of \\"Notorius\\" manages the same feat.) For my money, \\"Big Thing\\" is equally as good as \\"Notorious,\\" and in my opinion, better than the \\"Wedding Album.\\"
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I thought this was typical Jack Reacher but the ending was too abrupt. I felt the number of words required by the publisher was reached and it just stopped.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I just love this game. It is very addictive . It work's very well on my Kindle Fire. I can't stop playing this game.
B004T32SOK|5.0|This app works very well.  The thing I like about it is that I can upload all my music and have it avaliable anywhere Internet is accessible. This app / website can also be accessed at school which means carrying around a flash drive is a thing of the past. It is like a Five gigabite cloud you get for free. It is totally free and you can probably pay and upgrade to a larger storage space. I would recommend it to friends.
B008JH5CVS|1.0|What a terrible movie. It starts out well, but I think that's all they had to go on. No reasons for what happens on the space station. The end is rushed and makes no sense unless suddenly everyone is psychic. Sigh. Don't waste your money. Why are those space ships flying around and around in front of robot guns??!! I want my money back.
B005J2UM9S|3.0|I love horror movies, and have watched many good and bad. This movie was solidly in the middle of the pack. The haunted insane asylum may have been done before, but it makes the setting sufficiently creepy. There were some good tension filled scenes that made me jump as well. My biggest problem was the inconsistency in the characters. Their personalities were all over the place (of course I have never been trapped in a haunted building, so who is to say how ones personality may transform). The ending felt a little rushed. Overall I would recommend this movie if you need to kill a couple hours late at night.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|This purchase was for 5 copies of this movie, making nine so far--one for me and eight for friends and family. When I love a book, I want everyone to read it; I love this movie and I want everyone to see it. It's a low budget indie film set in Dublin; the major characters were not even professional actors.  Yet it's so absorbing and the characters and situations seem so real. (I am not, by the way, an arty indie snob..I love movies, including big budget blockbuster movies.) It touched me as no other movie has in years. And the music! I also fell in love with the music, which now has a prominent place on my Ipod.  Glen Hansard as a songwriter and performer appeals across a lot of age and genre boundaries.  Now i'm going to see the Broadway show, and hope I am not disappointed.
1455502758|5.0|It's rare to find this type of literature, because it's destined to be a classic of timeless value. It touches the deepest part of us, the stuff that we all pretend can never happen, at least not yet; our very personal deaths. Without restrictions, pity, or agenda, Hitchen's contribution will echo with anyone brave enough to read this and face the message. What an extraordinary human to be able to write as honestly as this. Buy this book and read it, or pretend you will live forever. Your call.
B0091THRCU|4.0|This case is very well built.  I was hesitant to buy it because it had no reviews, but my worries were needless.  This is a very nice sleeve.  I love the look and feel of a naked iPhone 5, but I dont want to risk it getting scratched by objects in my pocket.  It does its job.  My complaints:  It is PU, but it is only $20 so I won't complain much about that.  My main problem is that it may fit a little too snug.  I know a sleeve should have a secure fit, but this one is very secure.  I worry a little bit about the strap breaking and then i cant use the sleeve because of how hard it would be to get the phone out.  Also, you have to pull the tab pretty hard to get it out.  I am not sure if this will still be a problem later.  I may just need some time to break it in.  Still, I recommend this case.
1594203334|5.0|This was the first parenting book I have ever read. I selected it not because I knew much about France or French parenting, but because the parenting styles I have seen modeled to me in the U.S. are disconcerting at best. This book provides a widow into one family's life--an honest journey to pursue raising a healthy, happy family. I think for the most part, the goal of raising a healthy, happy family is universal. Throughout the book, the author presents her struggles, fears, and triumphs as a parent with humor, compassion, and a cross-cultural understanding that parenting in any culture is both challenging and rewarding. Her bibliography has provided me with a new reading list to delve deeper into the topic of French vs American parenting styles. I highly recommend this engaging, thought-provoking book!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This brilliant series is a must read. The character's are well developed and placed thoughtfully in a richly developed world that perfectly serves as a backdrop for exploring some of the greatest and darkest questions of humanity.<br /> This series fills me with a renewed interest in independant authors and leaves me wondering who is asleep at the wheel of the major publishing houses that they have let a jewel like this escape their notice. Penguin, Macmillan, Random House - any of you guys paying attention? What are your talent scouts doing that they are too busy to read this?
0425263908|3.0|I enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey more.  This one seemed like such a rip off of Fifty Shades in a lot of ways.  I felt it was really rushed to the conclusion.  Very difficult to not compare it to Fifty.  It's more wham bam thank you mam, lacking in story line.

1401937519|3.0|The story of Anita's NDE and healing are amazing. You can't deny the proof of her remarkable recovery; it has been heavily documented by the medical community. I found her description of the unconditional love and lack of judgement she experienced \\"on the other side\\" to be truly profound.<br /><br />She lost me later in the book, when, as other reviewers said, her repetitiveness grows tiresome and so does the New Agey/Eastern philosophy-jargon. As someone with a westernized mindset I didn't even understand what she was talking about half the time during the latter part of the book. Also, I disagree with her belief that \\"life isn't supposed to be a struggle - we're just here to enjoy it and have fun!\\"  I believe we are here for purposes other than just to \\"come here and feel good about ourselves and about life - just express ourselves and have fun with it!\\"<br /><br />I think her suffering has molded her character for the better, in its own way. Suffering, endured with grace, is always a character builder. Suffering is just a part of life; we don't always bring it on ourselves by our failure to love ourselves and express ourselves authentically, as Anita seems to think.<br /><br />It stands to reason that a woman from a privileged class who has no children or need to struggle to earn a living would think this way. Those of us who know the hardships of being broke, having kids with their endless needs to factor into every decision in life, and therefore often-draining daily responsibilities, know that life isn't really this simplistic for the average person.<br /><br />Still, the NDE experience she describes and her truly remarkable recovery make at least the first half of the book worth reading.

My son calls it the \\"crocodile game.\\"  He likes it because it never has a YOU LOSE screen to frustrate him.  It's Play Until You Win!<br /><br />It is also challenging enough for an adult to play and replay for hours trying to get all the stars!
B005LAII5I|4.0|Some critics might call some of these classic action heroes &#34;dumb&#34; characters based on their past performances with all brawn and little brains, but they've already missed the point of what these heroes, like Stallone (Rocky, Rambo), Jean Claude van Damme (Hard Target, Blood Sport) or Arnold Schwarzenegger (Conan, Terminator) are all about: Kicking @ss.<br /><br />And from the start to finish, that's what Expendables 2 does, blasting off with an intro action scene that's usually reserved for the ENDING of most action movies, just to put things in perspective for what's in store. Most of the classic 80's heroes are here in top form despite their age, and this movie is a celebration of action movies in general.<br /><br />Great pacing as there is an action scene waiting around the next corner, with Stallone offering a brutal, gory tone no doubt inspired by his latest RAMBO film. Expendables 2 has plenty of light hearted moments with a comical tone despite the vicious action of bullets and martial arts.<br /><br />For great, fun and no holds barred action, buy Expendables 2 to add to your action collection.<br /><br />ACTION: 9/10 Top notch and plenty of it.<br />STORY: 8/10 For an action movie, it's easy to follow and fun.<br />ACTING: 8/10 Exactly what you would hope for. Classic heroes are back.<br />SPECIAL FX: 9/10. Great explosions, bullets and gory action fx.<br />SOUND: 9/10. Doesn't get much better.<br /><br />------------<br />Suggestions for Expendables 3 cast are debatable, but I wouldn't mind seeing Wesley Snipes (pending release) Jackie Chan, Hulk Hogan, The Rock, but also quite a few other overlooked heroes of the past make at the very least, a cameo action scene as they did with Chuck Norris in part 2.<br />Some might even suggest for some female heroes, Milla Jovovich, Sigourney Weaver or Kate Beckinsale, but that's probably pushing it for the future films if the series goes past 3.
B000Q79HS8|4.0|While still a fine addition to the Bourne trilogy, Supremacy is the weakest of the three. The plot suffers from a bit too much \\"nothing happening\\" until the end, and even that much is mostly setting up the final, superior movie.

B007C4ZJ0S|3.0|First, I hope this film doesn't doorstop Gina Carano from getting a really good action film under her belt. It was acceptable B -  movie fare by a thread but Soderbergh was either asleep or leaving most of the directing duties to a 12 year old. The story, the talent and, probably, the money demanded something better. This could have been Carano's  'Enter the Dragon' but played out like a big budget episode of any current television actioner.<br />  It really irks me when there are so many of the right cards being held and then, some where along the way, the holder chokes on a simple bet and loses on a beautiful straight.<br />  I REALLY want to see Gina Carano in more films. She held up her end of things in this one and has credible acting chops to stride along with the physicality of her role and she's hot. This could have been in league with a Bourne flick and even surpassed 'Salt' just with Carano's obviously full inclusive stunt work.<br />  There was no use of any true camera artistry that wasn't laughable in the 80's.  Steven Soderbergh has done some great films  and owed the entire cast better attention.<br />  Bill Paxton has mere moments of screen time but owns his part as does Micheal Douglas. Ewan McGregor is a good, smarmy  corporate-type slime-ball and everyone else seems to have fun with their roles.<br />  Worth watching, yes. But had soooo much potential for a marquee style release.<br />  Dropped ball - director failed.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|My father was born in 1911 and I had no idea of life during this time and very little knowledge of the Russian Revolution or why America joined WWI via Woodrow Wilson.  I found the writing to be very interesting and the people well drawn. I found it an authentic view of life in Russia, Life in England, life in Germany and France during this time.  I was amazed at the violence towards the menial classes and the low status of women who were stuck in their status and could not move up in life.  You were born to it and your status remained the same. Many women were also fighting to win the right to vote in England. If you enjoy historical novels and the intrigue of politics during this era, or if you like Ken Follett's writings, I think you will enjoy this book. It is quite long but well worth reading.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|I've been a fan of Britney since I was 6 when ...Baby One More Time and Oops I did it again came out, I wasn't too excited about Circus, in my opinion this is one of her best albums ever, catchy songs, great sexy vibe and sexy voice. I really think the first two singles aren't the standout tracks of the album.<br /><br />Favorite songs are:<br />1. Inside Out - Should have been a single instead of Criminal<br />2. I Wanna Go - Great dance track with a sexy meaning<br />3. Big Fat Bass - Another nice, cool song<br />4. How I Roll - Original sound

B003VANOFY|2.0|Got these over 2 years ago. For the first year they were great. But then mic broke off. Since then I have had 3 more sets. I baby my hardware yet not only did the mic fall off the first pair but others have....earcup broke off the band, constant buzzing, shuts themselves off over and over, fails to charge even when plugged in and blinking. My 4th set just started buzzing and shutting itself off right now. The buzzing stopped a sec ago but they still wont stay on. Soon I hope they work again.<br /><br />So as much as I once loved Logitech and this pair of G930 I cannot recommend anyone buy these cheap built but expensive to buy headphones. Look into other manufacturers.

B00873GRU4|3.0|I read a lot of reviews and thought sounds a no brainier, we'll I'm wondering is this rigged? Was ok not fantastic. Anyone that was brought up with Logan's run this seems a very close copy.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This mystery was a great story but not up to the Jack Reacher standards. Jack is hitchhiking from Nebraska to Virginia and he gets picked up by two men who have just committed murder and are on the run. There are twists and turns you won't see coming and just when you think you have figured it out, there is another twist. Jack is at his best when he is faced with breaking in to a compound to rescue one of the good guys. I was really excited to receive another new Jack Reacher book. Okay, when is the next one coming??
B003VS0CYC|3.0|i had taped a \\" director cut \\" of ROBOCOP ,that was on cable once a few years back .Is any / or this version on BLURAY a \\" director cut \\" or just the regular one we had seen in the movies ?
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|It's pretty mediocre, but the acting wasn't too objectionable. I'm sure that, had I read the book, I would have found the movie to be even less enjoyable. In summation: don't expect much if you aren't already a fan of the series.

B0084IG8TM|5.0|I first read this book before it got big and popular and loved it.  When I heard the movie was coming out I was dying to see it and wondered how good the adaption would be.  In my opinion, a book ----> movie is either really good or really bad and in this case it might most of my expectations.  Yes they did change and leave some things out but thats to be expected.  Not everything in the book translates well to a good scene so they change things around.  If you are a fan of the book I'm sure you've already seen it but if not watch it and enjoy!

Very relevent to what's happening in ME right now. Glad I read it before White House and MSM could spin it.

B002Q1YDLI|5.0|SPOILERS<br /><br />In this sequel to \\"Something Borrowed\\", we pick up with Darcy Rhone after the wedding question is settled.  She is still self-centered, gossipy and pregnant.  The baby is not even her ex-fiancee's, which causes her negative ramifications.  Her family is not psyched to find out about the baby and her friends are not supportive as she anticipated. She continues to fixate on what Dexter and Rachel are doing, etc. and annoying the baby's father.<br /><br />She finds that she needs to change her life, so she goes to London to visit her childhood friend, Ethan.  At first, she is purposely vague how long she intends to stay when discussing it with him. We know she intends to move there.  As her pregnancy progresses, she learns some major life lessons and goes about becoming a better person.  While living with Ethan, he goes from being frustrated with Darcy to having deeper feelings for her.<br /><br />I enjoyed the ending and seeing how she grew from the beginning to the end of the book.  I absolutely hated how vain, selfish and obnoxious she was in the first book and this book's beginning.  It shows how one can grow, if one takes action to do so.
B002ZG999U|4.0|This movie was very good. It is not often that you see all the action stars together in one film. Stallone is good in character as well. A typical action film.

0553801473|1.0|this guy takes so much time between books that you forget what's going on. He fills a book with words that don't mean anything. I read the first three books and like them. book 4 sucked. I will never read any more of his garbage.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|The Night Circus was an interesting sort of dark and sinister book which I enjoyed. I only gave it 3 stars and if I had to pinpoint exactly what I did not like I'd say it did not \\"flow\\". I found it a little difficult to read. It is a timepiece based in the turn of the century mostly in London. The chapters jumped forward and backward so I figured out a few chapters in that you have to note the DATE and YEAR of each chapter or you will be LOST. The story line was part love story, part competition and it just never got off the ground. I kept waiting for the BIG REVEAL to the competition and the BIG CRESCENDO to the love story but neither really happened. Having said that I loved the magic and the descriptions of the circus. I felt like I was there with the attractions and tents and treats. This book was a feast for the imagination.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|I wasn't going to worry about reviewing this movie on Amazon, as it will have plent I'm sure. But, after reading the 1-star morons who posted about how Amazon treated them, yet think the product is great, I thought I should counteract their idiocy. How do people not grasp this is a product review, not a place to voice your gripes about Amazon? Saying a movie is great, then giving it a 1 star because your feelings are hurt by Amazon isn't an accurate review. Just like in everything else, we have to figure in skewed statistics because of the dummies.<br /><br />Its a 5 star movie, great quality blu ray, blah blah blah. If you like action and superheroes this movie has set a high precedence for action.
B004LWZW6U|4.0|It's EXACTLY what I was hoping for. A bunch of sexy silliness very similar to the first one. This one's a bit more over the top....maybe that's the problem? Honestly if you're not a fan of schlocky horror I don't know why you would be interested in this in the first place. The price is certainly right for this so if this looks like something you'd like, go ahead and try it because I\\"m sure you will.

B008RV5K5E|5.0|Bruce Timm is DA MAN! He totally GETS these characters and stories. They feel completely authentic. The production values for this one in particular are stellar. The score is really great and pulls you into the story. All the voice cast are fantastic. It took a few minutes to get used to Weller's portrayal, but again it works wonderfully. By the time he gets to the line \\"You don't get it son. This isn't a mud pit....\\" I was practically cheering.<br /><br />It would have been nice to have a couple more special features, but maybe they're saving those for part 2. I hope this is wrong, but in the peek at part 2, it says it's coming out in WINTER OF 2013! That's over a year away!<br /><br />I would say this is the best DC animated film released so far, even better than Red Hood.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I enjoyed this story quite a bit. Very twilight zone. Well worth the money and time. Will be buying the next book but I could see this author getting stuck in a loop of stories like this.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I'm a belgian fan of Jack Reacher. Fortunatly I can read in English but not write correctly, anyway I want to let everybody know how I like this last novel. I stop reading as much as possible just because I'm afraid to reach the end of the book. Bravo Monsieur Lee Child !
B00005NTJK|5.0|I first heard this album probably right after it came out, and the album cover artwork<br />caught my attention because of the group member cutout look to the front and the<br />resembling to a performance stage where the cut outs are placed. But the music, the blending<br />from song to song, the echoplexing of Ian's flute, and just the absolute fine lyrical and musical<br />arrangements blew me away. And this was the album that made me a fan for life and started me on that<br />appreciation of Jethro Tull. Needless to say I bought the limited release box set of their history also<br />which gave me hours of listenng pleasure. To this day though I recommend Benefit to anyone, and<br />It is the gift that keeps on giving, anytime of the year!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|When I went to the fair as a kid, I would look forward in playing this game. This game is fun and addicting just like the real ones.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I bought this series just before it won the Emmy for the Best Drama Series of last season. I wasn't surprised when it won; it's that good.  I had missed the show as it aired since I'm not a subsciber to its home channel, but I think it was even more enjoyable to watch it for two or three hours each evening, several days in a row.  The plot remains fresh in the viewer's mind, building the dramatic tension.<br />Clare Danes is a remarkable actor. I sometimes felt that her mental/emotional breakdowns were a little over the top although probably realistic for the condition she has. But I couldn't understand how someone so fragile could remain in her sensitive CIA job. Surely her behavior would have set off alarms in the people she was closest to?  But that's a plot criticism, not aimed at her acting.<br />As the second season opens, there is still ambiguity about the possible terrorist/new Congressman. And how Clare will fight him from her new situation.  Or will she allow herself to fall in love with him?  Will his marriage survive his secrets and all the betrayals? Viewers have many reasons to tune in again. It's such a very good series; no fan of quality TV will want to miss it.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I'm hooked on this series, however book 5 cannot compare to the first.  Still I can't put it down.  Martin spends too much time however, in describing scenes,some of which are pretty disgusting as you would imagine in places decimated by war.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Suzanne Collins trilogy (of which The Hunger Games is the first book). This beautifully shot, and well-acted film delivers some powerful messages.<br />While I would not recommend this movie for younger viewers (the violence is very realistic), I would enthusiastically endorse it as a much needed wake-up call.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Is it perfect? No. That said...neither is it sugar coated or dumbed down for kid consumption. This is the brutal and brooding Batman of Miller's epic (perfectly cast with Peter Weller)that I have wanted to see on screen since 1986. I was pleasantly surprised how faithful to the source material they were. Some character design was lacking...but that is the sole criticism I can give it (other than the terrible cover art, which should have been the iconic silhouette against the lightning). I knew the guys at DC knew full well that if they fouled this up, it would be a big mistake. They also knew to get the full scope of this story, they would have to do two features. There is violence abound and, while mildly taken down a notch, it's all there. One little thing I appreciated...and I think it was fitting...there were NO OPENING TITLES. That's Timm and company saying..\\"you know what this is and it needs no introduction\\" to me. It was definitely made with reverence for the greatest graphic novel ever put on paper.<br /><br />I can only hope that part two is just as faithful, but this has given me hope that it will be all I am anticipating.<br /><br />In the hopes that someone at DCs animation division reads this little review, I am PLEADING with you....KINGDOM COME NEXT!!!!!!
0345803485|1.0|Flat characters. Ham-handed, simplistic language. REPETITIVE. Horribly, horribly repetitive. The author only seems to know a handful of ways of describing character dialogue and interaction, and she reuses these few ways exhaustively. These characters do nothing but say or think the same things over and over (e.g., Holy something or other) and run their hands through their hair or blush all day long. That is, if they're not arguing over some imagined conflict that the author picked out of thin air because she isn't even imaginative enough to come up with something that makes any sense.<br /><br />I wish I could understand why this book is so popular. I've picked up better romance novels at the dollar store, and read grittier sex in Harlequin.<br /><br />No vision at all. Just a bare bones recycling of other works . . . it's painfully obvious that this entire story was originally an attempt at Twilight fan-fiction. And not good fan-fiction, either.<br /><br />Argh.
B0028DRGDQ|3.0|I bought \\"Rec\\" after watching Quarantine and Quarantine 2. I knew the two american can films originated from a foreign film so I wanted to see the foreign film that I read so much about. So I order it from Amazon. And was pretty good. The production values aren't up to par with its America counter part but they do what they can with what they've got. I wouldn't say its better than Quarantine, but its still worth a watch.
0525953728|5.0|This book should be in every single american home and in schools, and every terrorist should think twice about messing with America. Great book, great job to the Navy Seals. and everyone else involved.
B006HGXGWU|2.0|Now that I think about it, this movie is alot like Signs. Except less special effects, less plot resolving, and a bit boring. Ouch. But its true. See its about this guy living a simple small town america life, when suddenly he starts have these visions. The visions make him  a bit paranoid of his real life, and he starts to wonder if they're just mental delusions, or if they're real. As i said before, it doesn't have a lot of special effects in my opinion. Its really more of a character driven movie; which wouldn't be a bad thing if the dialogue wasn't so boring. I don't want to recommend this movie because I don't want to set your expectations too high.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This wasn't the best book, but it's a necessity in reading the trilogy.  Personally, I found Ana annoying in this one!  I LOVE the trilogy as a whole, though, so it's not like you can NOT read one!! :-)
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I have to admit at first I only wanted to see this movie because Theron was there, she always does a great job with her characters and her portrayal of the evil queen did not dissapoint. Her acting was excellent and her Evil Queen is the best rendition I have seen so far. Chris did a really good job with the Huntsman and was a very relatable character which is why I understand their reasoning to continue the franchise expanding his character. I did not expect anything from Stewart as Im not a fan of her performances in the past however, I was surprised that at times she actually did show emotion in some scenes (she actually smiled here an there, I attribute that to her imagining Chris in his Thor costume while in scene). The story is quite interesting, there were some unnecessary characters in play that really did not add much value to the movie, Im speaking of Sam Clafin(trying to keep it spoiler free so Im being as vague as possible).<br /><br />Overall it is a good movie, it can be kind of long so you want to make sure you are up for a longer movie before you sit by it but it was very fun to me even with Stewart and Clafin playing some of the major roles. Parent warning, the Theron does a really good evil witch (as I already mentioned) which might be too scary for younger audiences.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|After reading all of the Reacher books this was a let down not enough of the reacher character. I was disappointed .
B00846REIS|5.0|couldn't put it down. Sylvia Day did a wonderful job creating strong, dynamic characters. I can't wait to read her next book!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|The theatrical version of Rock of Ages may not have received multiple awards or lots of recognition but I loved it.<br />The film used the voice talent of the actors to re-record multiple classic 80's songs.<br />This is that album with the actors signing!<br />They did an excellent job on each solo!
B005LAIHYU|4.0|Fun movie. I don't usually buy videos but I am buying this one! Loved it in the theater. Anyone who is expecting a serious or a historically accurate movie will be disappointed (duh.) But the production values, acting, and special effects were much better than I expected. The plot was much deeper than I expected for a movie with this title. The action was almost non-stop and many of the fight-scenes were over the top, but thoroughly enjoyable. This film has changed my life in one way: I am now convinced that Abraham Lincoln is way more awesome than Chuck Norris.<br /><br />This movie is not life-changing (again, duh) but it's a whole lot of fun. Highly recommended.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Lots of fun to play, but it can lag a bit at times (Droid X) and cause the phone to slow after you're done playing.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like this app because it is very easy to use. The numbers are big and bold and you can easily detect when you have keyed a number by mistake. This is good for the young and the not so young.

0345525558|4.0|Did I enjoy this book: I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was beautifully written. I read it every free chance I had. I wanted - no, I needed - to see how it all worked out in the end. And I was not disappointed with the ending.<br /><br />I had mixed feelings with Victoria. I liked her and I wanted her to overcome her past and succeed in her future. But, at the same time, I found her to be selfish and sometimes the cause of her own misery. It was wonderful to see Victoria take someone - Marlena - under her wing and help her move forward much like Renata did for her. There were other events that happened to Victoria that I just couldn't believe her reactions and subsequent actions. (I don't want to spoil anything for anyone...but there were parts that made me angry with Victoria.) But in her heart, Victoria was a good person and tried to do her best.<br /><br />Elizabeth was a character that I really liked. She made some mistakes but she had the best intentions. I really loved Elizabeth in the end. Renata was a great friend, mentor, and there when Victoria most needed someone in her life. Renata was there even though she didn't know Victoria's story...she knew something and that intuition made her an even greater friend to Victoria. I felt so bad for Grant. He was so patient and loving. I loved how he and Victoria \\"met.\\" That was very interesting writing - a great exchange between these two characters.<br /><br />I've always known that some flowers meant certain things or conveyed certain messages. I did not know, prior to reading this book, the extent of these definitions and meanings or the differences that are out there. It was a neat experience to read how people can convey a message with a simple flower and have the message understood and appreciated in some form by the receiver.<br /><br />Would I recommend it: I would recommend this book. It was a great book club book.<br /><br />Will I read it again: I will not.<br /><br />[...]
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Read this book for book club. Bronte was sizzling. Really enjoyed the story. Heathcliff is a very dark  and ruthless character and Bronte pulled no punches. The movie seems so tame now! Had to brush up on my vocabulary but thank goodness dictionary.com is part of the upload options. I am moving on to \\"Tess the U'bervilles\\" next!
0345802934|3.0|It's a strange novel... in a bad way, I am afraid.<br />I think Murakami had overdone it this time, overused his special style and techniques. Like his other books, when you read 1Q84, it gives you a feeling that there is a deeper meaning that just escapes you. But when It was over, I realized that probably there was no meaning to begin with.<br /><br />First of all, as all the readers noted, it's very long. But it's not the length really that is disturbing, but the fact that it's unnecessarily long. What is known about a good writing is that it should be written so that every detail and every character is there for a reason. I found that 1Q84 has conversations, situations, characters, etc., that can be easily dropped without changing anything at all, without making any impact. For example, after the first night out with Ayumi, when Aomame and Ayumi have just met, Aomame couldn't remember if her sex partner used condom. This point, the fact that she couldn't remember, was somewhat emphasized. The reader would naturally think that this should mean something, that this situation will have some development. But no - nothing at all. More than that: Aomame is presented throughout as a very cautious person, that does not take unnecessary risk and does not do stupid things...<br /><br />The other flaw is that all characters, including main characters, are undeveloped and flat. Even though sometimes Murakami describes their actions in great details, those details do not contribute really to anything.<br />Ayumi, for example, is so badly presented that she would say things that are entirely out of her character.<br />For example, she, in one scene, makes an almost political speech, when normally all she talks about is sex and other personal matters. People are contradictory creatures, I get it, but I doubt it was the intention of the author to demonstrate that in Auimi's character.<br /><br />The last thing I wanted to mention is that when a book has a number of unexplainedphenomena, it's a good thing, as it allows a reader to wonder and to reach his own conclusion, and therefore, it creates a potential for meaningfulness on different levels. However, when a book consists entirely of unexplained phenomena, it no longer produces the same effect. It, sort of, becomes meaningless. That's what I felt about 1Q84, the meaning of little people, the meaning of \\"irretrievably  lost\\", the meaning of...all the rest. I can think of what all of those things could mean, but they could mean so many things that there is no point really to talk about it.<br /><br />This being said, I give this book 3 stars because:<br />First, the author made me interested enough, so I finished reading.<br />Second, I wonder if by breaking literary rules of 'good literature', it represents a new stream, or a new genre, kind of 'stream of subconsciousness'... In short, I give it a benefit of a doubt; there might be something in it that I failed to discover yet.
0345803485|1.0|I downloaded this um... bunch of words onto my Kindle on a recommendation from my cousin, and I think I'm going to have to have a word with her. I'm literally at 21% of this piece of \\"holy crap\\" and I just have to say no to the rest of it. I cannot believe this is what all the hype was about. This is, without question, the worst book I have ever attempted to read in my life. The writing is AWFUL - sophomoric, trite, repetitive, POINTLESS - I just can't go on. I am completely irritated that I spent the money and time on this. I wish I had read the review from nopeachoil who rightfully warns...\\"You will not be able to unread this book if you decide to try it...\\"<br /><br />To commiserate with other reviewers: If I EVER hear the mention of Inner Goddess and Holy (insert any word you want here) again, I think I will have to stick knitting needles into my ears.<br /><br />On a final note: My favorite part of this excruciating experience is reading the other 1-star reviews - which are ALL right-on and hilarious. I'm actually going to go back to reading them.... right after I delete \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" from my Kindle. Good riddance.
B002ZG9800|4.0|I Love You Phillip Morris is a wonderful movie. It is very obviously about two gay men who are in love, one of whom is an unrepentant conman. Oh, and it's the true story of the main character, Steve. That just makes the movie that much better, after reading up a little on the man, knowing that all of this happened. The only downside is the graphicness of the first few minutes. There is a scene of very uncomfortable, clothed, hetero sex that I could have done without, and a similar scene of gay sex that made me uncomfortable because of the nudity and language used in it. The romantic scenes between Steve and Phillip (Jim and Ewan) were the least graphic in the film, and most were actually very sweet. Basically, if you enjoy seeing romance (not just random sex scenes, but actual romance, with dancing and kissing scenes) between two gay men and don't mind the one graphic scene, watch this movie. It's touching and a little sad. However, if you have a homophobic fiber in your body, don't watch it. It'll just set you off, and the world can do without that rant. ;)
0345803485|1.0|The worst book I have tried to read in my adult life.  I read about 30 pages and then just flipped through the rest at random seeing that nothing much happens except lots of bad writing.  Read the end which confirmed it was not worth reading at all.
B009B50QOU|3.0|This will be pretty short. I'm not a dedicated Green Day fan or anything, but I like many of their singles and have delved into some of their albums in full. This one is easily the most disappointing. The riffs are OK. The drums are kinda energetic. However, the lyrics are the low point. And while the words to Green Day aren't that deep generally, these really hit a wall. I haven't heard a more clich&eacute;-ridden work from them than this. These guys used to be a lot of fun. The other albums that I've heard in full were [[ASIN:B000002MP2 Dookie]] and [[ASIN:B0002OERI0 American Idiot]]. I enjoyed both of them thoroughly and would like to own both (especially the former). This album seems to put the easiest words together to rhyme and the energy is kind of low for them. What happened??!<br /><br />\\"Stay The Night\\" stood out on first listen. But none of these tracks stands against some of the catchier, riffier songs in their catalog. This record I suppose is better than No Doubt's new one, but this one was more disappointing knowing what the band is capable of hence the lower score. Sorry. But for die-hards only.<br /><br />3 stars.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The author's account in \\"No Easy Day\\" is a very believable account of the action that killed Osama! A truly great read! The book is certainly more believable than either the White House's or various Media accounts.
B008RYN44U|3.0|If you've heard their 1st single &#34;Settle Down&#34;, you know what the album sounds like somewhat. There are party records but also ballads that seem to generally deal with Gwen's breakup with Gavin Rossdale. Sometimes when Gwen hits higher notes she comes off as a bit screechy and whiny, but we all know what her voice is like by now. You either like it or you don't. I personally like her.<br /><br />Anyway, some songs are duds but the winners are:<br /><br />&#34;One More Summer&#34; - A favorite track on the record. Has great verses.<br /><br />&#34;Easy&#34; - This one floats by pleasantly. Unlike some of the filler tracks it's not annoying.<br /><br />&#34;Heaven&#34; - Another catchy ditty, &#34;Heaven&#34; has hand claps and a very dance-oriented vibe going on for it.<br /><br />&#34;Sparkle&#34; - The chorus is kinda catchy and it has Gwen daydreaming about the past with her old flame. It has a light reggae feel during the hook.<br /><br />&#34;Undercover&#34; - This one is really catchy and I like the verses and choruses here.<br /><br />&#34;Undone&#34; - A pretty ballad about a relationship coming to an end when it wss just getting to the great part. Probably my favorite track.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Some of the other tracks are not so bad but a few of them aren't that great. These six stood out the most. I honestly didn't expect another dance record (at least as a whole) but what we got is something most like 2001's [[ASIN:B00005QDW1 Rock Steady]]. I can see &#34;Heaven&#34;, &#34;Sparkle&#34; or &#34;One More Summer&#34; being singles. I'm sure this record will sell decent either way though. Lots of people are into the dance craze that's been going on for a while now. While I do miss the heartfelt tunes of [[ASIN:B00004SAWN Return of Saturn]] and the rock-oriented and spunky [[ASIN:B000001Y79 Tragic Kingdom]], I guess we can just revisit those records because No Doubt is onto bigger and better(?) things. Overall, their second worst affair I've delved into.<br /><br />3.75 stars.<br /><br />Note: I've edited this review a couple of times and updated the score from a 3 to a 3.75 because although the album isn't as catchy as it could have been as whole, it is still decent. Like some have already said it just feels a little uninspired in spots. Gwen's voice hasn't changed much at all over the years (and that's a good thing). It's just that she sounds like she's just going through the motions sometimes.es and updated the score from a 3 to a 3.75 because although the album isn't as catchy as it could have been as whole, it is still decent.

B0094OLJD0|5.0|This is a very special and unique work. Smart, modern and beautiful.  The horns, the rhythm section the lyrics. The tone colors. It all works together and it makes me feel so good. I never heard of St. Vincent, but I'll be looking for more. Has Byrne ever disappointed? This is on my short list for the best album of the year in a year of excellent music. Love this giant of an album!

B003PIS5XI|5.0|I was a teen when \\"The Last Starfighter\\" came out. I was dazzled by the computer graphics, which were so amazing to a mostly-computerless world. Surprisingly, they still hold up for their quality.  But don't get this movie just because it was a pioneer in the genre. What makes this film noteworthy is the storyline. In this day's sea of nudity, sex, blood, gore and profanity used to shock or sell sub-standard movies, this film stands high and dry. It's a sweet love story, a rousing space journey, and a small-town boy makes good story all rolled into one thoroughly charming package.  It was great then, and holds up admirably. A film you can watch with your kids and talk about the importance of friendship and doing the right thing.  Only regret: there was no sequel. I could have done with more of this and a half-dozen fewer Rocky movies.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|as just an avid reader and non-technophile I enjoyed this one even more than Zero Day!  didn't spend as much time it seems on technical details for explanatory purposes but just an excellent, excellent read! kept all tension building until it was .. please let me just get this over with I'm dying here! - kind of tension :)<br />happy to recommend as one of best I've read this year (~175/year) so far!<br />great job

B002ZG99A4|5.0|This move is just as good, maybe even better than the first one. I enjoyed it along with my wife, because of so many great action guys from the past.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun cool and a good time spender there is way more positive things to say about this app! My friends and I play it all the time I play it on my kindle fire and one of my friends plays this on her IPod Touch. I recommend buying this app plus it's free!
B0091W4PRC|5.0|The movie is simply outstanding. It deals with the reality of growing up underprivileged, and overcoming adversity through hard work.  It also centers around human compassion, and what can be accomplished if an individual is given an opportunity to succeed.  One of my favorite movies of all time.  Highly recommend!
B008K93302|1.0|...with .mpg files. Notice that the joker who reviewed this without having used it is pulling the star average up. This app is really bad - no file management to speak of, lousy user interface, can't play .mpg files, one of the most common formats out there, and one the \\"company\\" says it can play. Waste of a good dollar.

B007GCY8FS|2.0|Found this book to be very disappointing and certainly not up the standards I have become used to and look for in Lee Child's character Jack Reacher.  Hope he is not getting complacented.  This book was boring.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|This is a great pilot movie for the introduction of Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner).  And based the amount of written Bourne material still unexplored, this is a good expansion of the series.  While there are a number of reviews already written on the plot and outcome, I will keep my review relevant and short.  For the collector, this is a 'must have' movie.  It's non-stop action from beginning to end.  It does not take away from any of the previous movies and in fact suggests a potential teaming of of Aaron and Jason in a later film.  Tremendous Movie.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Used hints a lot but loved the game. Can't wait for next one to be released. First time I've ever rated a game.

B003UBTX7C|4.0|This was one you don't want to put down. I like all the Camel Club series. It seems to help when you read them in order.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|If you're interested in the financial crisis, this is a entertaining.  Though the film takes on both parties, it has a clear liberal bias.  Barney Frank, one of the chief architects of the sub prime crisis appears in the film, so he gets a complete pass.  Other who don't appear get hammered.  There's plenty of blame to go around so it's kinda fun to see all the corruption uncovered, but don't expect balance.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read. It was a thoroughly enjoyable read.  I couldn't put it down.  It really made me think about whether I am so busy worried about having too little time that I fail to appreciate the time that I spend with the most important people in my life.  I highly recommend this book.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|good game simalar to temple run just better power ups and other things like that but the cool thing is that it has Zombies!!!!!!!!

0671004107|5.0|I am normally not a science fiction reader. I enjoy non fiction and rarely dabble in fiction but i had to make an exception for carl sagan. I read essentialy all his other works and decided i had to read this book and lets just say i was not disapointed. This is a must read for everyone, especially fans of sagan or astronomy. It is well written and has a gripping story. Highly recommended
B008C1O8CA|5.0|One thing you can say about Green Day in the last ten years is that you never know what you're getting when they release a new album. American Idiot was an ambitious angst ridden rock opera and 21st Century Breakdown was an even more musically ambitious and politically fueled album. Both albums were great and I believe will become classic rock albums with time. Now Green Day has released UNO and are doing something that they haven't done in ten years: they're having fun.<br /><br />  This album is Green Day letting their hair down and having a beer after their two epic projects. The songs are rough and edgy in a good way and have a sarcastic attitude that Billie Joe has resurrected from his earlier albums. The songs do not go as deep as the last two albums, but they instead resonate with the basic daily emotions, anger, and frustration that we feel everyday by using satire and sarcasm. This is a great rock album that does as well in your car CD player as in your stereo at a party. It even has some really great guitar parts. Also, \\"Kill the DJ\\" is worth the price of the album if only to hear a great satire of the pop-synth-rock top 40 bands like Maroon 5 and the like.<br /><br />  Green Day's last 2 albums took us on a wild ride, and their newest album let's us take a breather and kick back with them. A great album and a natural progression in the career of Green Day.
0425263908|2.0|Okay, so after reading Fifty Shades of Grey (My first time ever reading erotica romance) I was looking for something similar and Bared to You popped up as a recommendation. A couple of my co-workers read it and liked it, so I thought, \\"Why not?\\"<br /><br />Well... it was lackluster at best.  Gideon and Eva had no depth to them other than the fact that they were both emotionally damaged and \\"need\\" each other oh so much.  Blah, blah, blah.  They were pretty boring and bland outside of that.  Not only that, but the book lacked emotional depth.  I undersand that they both had damaged pasts but come on!  There has to be more to them than wallowing in self-loathing.  Another thing that bothered me, was the fact that all of the characters were described as gorgeous.  It was like all of the characters were Stepford Wives or Abercrombie & Fitch male models.<br /><br />And because of that they were all having sex.  All the time.  It started out as sexy and it moved to a gross porno.  The sex was constant!  Gideon was apparently walking around with a hard-on the entire time and he probably could have become a spokesman for viagra for as many times that I read about his erection.  And the language used during the sex scenes was crude and tasteless.  Maybe Sylvia Day thought that it would add to the intense, primal passion that Eva and Gideon share, but it only made it seem like two horny teenagers romping around in the back of Mom and Dad's car.<br /><br />All in all, Bared to You was not my favorite read.  I found it somewhat tasteless and bland, with crude language that detracted from the love story of Gideon and Eva.  Even though I did not thoroughly enjoy it, I will be reading the sequel,  Reflected in You.  I think that it is important to give the author a second chance and I hope that the second book in the Crossfire series will captivate me as much as I wanted the first one to.
B0099G7KDQ|3.0|It's not that this is a bad album - it's most certainly not. A lot of the technique and musicianship that made so many people (including me) fall in love with \\"Sigh No More\\" is here. There's a great energy to this album, and a lot of emotion. I'm not particularly bothered that there isn't much creative growth on display from their first album - after all, I really liked that album and more of the same wouldn't be a bad thing.<br /><br />But something's missing, and after a few listens I think I can put my finger on it.<br /><br />Quite simply, this album doesn't have the hooks that their first album had. Those little bits of melody that insinuate themselves in your brain and don't let go, the itch you can't scratch unless you listen to the song again. \\"Sigh No More\\" had hooks to spare. The title track alone had two or three of them, and nearly every song had something that stuck in your brain from the very first listen.<br /><br />On this album, not so much. And instead of the ineffable magic of a good hook, the band substitutes skill, hard work, and a lot of emoting. These guys are solid pros, they don't mail it in - but a big part of the magic of first album is missing. There's still plenty to like here, but relatively speaking it's all pretty forgettable.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like that this app gives suggestions for boards.<br />It works very well on the Kindle Fire. It does lock up from time to time though.

B000QCQ8XA|5.0|No real surprise that I loved this book as I love everything I have read by this author. I wish Tropper would write faster so I can read even more from him. However, this one had a nice mix of funny and warm with a touch of sadness. Tropper's dysfunctional families are wonderful, even when a tragedy like the death of his beautiful and too young wife are part of the picture. Great from start to finish with several laugh out loud moments.
B0056BMK6K|1.0|This book is little more than a repackaging of used car sales gimmicks and half-truths.  This approach gives the art of writing a bad reputation and does little to vet stories crafted with skill.  Instead it pushes trash.  I've thrown my ecopy of this book into the etrash where it belongs.  Don't waste your time with this fluff piece.  It's all hot air and smoke that will mislead you into thinking phony reviews and hype are what are important in a book.  It will aspire you to the lowest level and sink you into a quagmire.  Stay away.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I was excited to get my Forerunner 405, as I had just taken up running and wanted to see my distance, monitor my heart rate, and plan my workouts.  I was never able to get the workouts set up, but the GPS and distance worked nicely.  The menus and bevel word hard to work, but I managed okay.  The heart rate monitor never worked right.  Customer service told me to take the battery out between uses, but since the battery was very difficult to get out, I just stopped using the monitor.  Strike One.  After a year, the watch started to run erratically, making weird beeping noises and then finally the face shut off and never worked again.  Strike Two.  When I contacted customer service, they told me the watch was beyond its warranty and there was nothing more they could do.  Strike Three.  Moral of the story--look for something else.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|This book was to much description and not enough character development. At the end it was really confusing on who these people were and what was the motive. Still after re-reading the end understand who was CIA, FBI or some other agency. What was this bunker all about?

B008MAI0WK|5.0|The Raspberry Pi User Guide is very useful for those 1) buying a RasPi who want to find out what else to buy with it, 2) setting up of a RasPi the first time and working through possible problems, and 3) applying the RasPi after setup. I found answers to most of my questions in the Kindle book. There is a lot of good reference material on line but it takes time to find it; this book is a convenient reference. The book is detailed enough, concise, and organized. Going back to the index when necessary allowed quickly finding a desired subject area and jumping to it. Some information is already changing but this book by Eben, one of the key players behind the Raspberry Pi, is likely the most authoritative source available. The book sticks enough to the core material that it avoids losing the reader in the weeds.

1401929281|1.0|There was so much gibberish I could not bring myself to finish this book - rare for me.<br /><br />Save your money - instead try \\"Healing Code\\" by Lloyd - over 500 five&four-star reviews here.<br /><br />Still not sure? Here's the introduction to \\"ShadyHealing\\" an expose of Theta Healing by her own daughter-in-law: In 1995, Vianna Stibal proclaimed to have healed herself of cancer in an instant by asking God , and thereafter created the healing modality called ThetaHealing®. Having suffered from personal health ailments, author Lindsey Stock investigated this seemingly innocent method of healing and later married Vianna s son, Joshua. Over the years, inconsistencies in Vianna's teachings, stories and reality became blindingly apparent and difficult to rationalize.<br /><br />But the turning point came the day that Joshua left Lindsey, pregnant with their fourth child, when the truth finally came out. She was suddenly faced with the sickening realization that her husband was a conman, and worse - that his family of healers had covered for his lies, thefts and infidelity. She had to investigate further. The now-single mom uncovered a world that she never could have imagined... she'd been the daughter-in-law of a cult leader, and she was compelled to tell the world what she discovered.<br /><br />ShadyHealing is an insider perspective on a worldwide cult, based out of Idaho Falls, Idaho, through a timeline of life-altering events, quotations from ThetaHealing's leader and excerpts from never before seen court documents.
B00008G9JO|5.0|Jethro Tull's eleventh studio album entitled Heavy Horses was released in April of 1978.<br />The album saw the band (which comprised of lead singer/songwriter/flute player Ian Anderson plus guitarist Martin Barre, keyboard player John Evan, drummer Barriemore Barlow, bass player John Glascock whom were now joined by orchestrator David Palmer as second keyboard player) continue in the same direction that its predecessor, 1977's magnificent Songs From The Wood, was which was hard rock mixed with folk and classical influences. At the time of recording, Punk and New Wave were the musical rage and bands like ELP, Yes, Jethro Tull, Genesis, Pink Floyd and their Canadian counterpart Rush and American counterparts like Styx and Kansas were seen as old hat compared to the new bands cropping out of England but Jethro Tull (like Pink Floyd, Rush, Genesis and Styx would subsequently) would see Punk as a kick in the pants to release strong albums (as I did when I heard the album on vinyl late in 2006 and then acquired the remastered CD in 2007).<br />We open the album with the superb ode to the housecat called \\"And The Mouse Police Never Sleeps\\" which is ping-ponging between folk and classic hard rock tinged prog rock. The next track is the folk influenced \\"Acres Wild\\" which is another great song. We follow with the superb hard rocker \\"No Lullaby\\" which spotlights Barlow's drumming and Barre's razor sharp guitar playing. We follow with another folk tinged piece entitled \\"Moths\\" which is another winner of a song. The first side of the album closed with the rocker \\"Journeyman\\" which spotlighted the late John Glascock's superb bass playing and more stellar guitar work from Barre and is a great rocker.<br />The second half of the album starts with \\"Rover\\" which is an excellent prog rocker in the vein of earlier Tull and could be either about a dog or man. \\"One Brown Mouse\\" follows and is another folk influenced number which tells of either a mouse or man and is too a great song. Next is the epic title cut which is the nine minute ode to the plow horses with every influence thrown in (rock, classical, folk and even a fiddle induced romp (which the disco loving sheep didn't get))! The original album ends with the folk rocker \\"Weathercock\\" which is another winner and a great way to end another Jethro Tull album.<br />The Heavy Horses album originally peaked at #19 on the Billboard album chart (which was the band's lowest charting studio album up to that point but disco and soundtracks shanghaied the American music scene) but did manage to sell a million copies nevertheless because the music is just that good!<br />In 2003, the album was re-released as a remastered CD on EMI/Capitol Records with two additional songs. First is \\"Living In These Hard Times\\" which is a great number which first appeared on the Out Of Print 20 Years of Jethro Tull box set. Next is another acoustic piece \\"Broadford Bazaar\\" which first appeared on the 1993 rarities collection Nightcap and is too a great song. It also has all of the original album artwork plus an essay from Ian Anderson himself plus photos, lyrics and thank you credits.<br />Heavy Horses is a great record, and still sounds fresh today.<br />RECOMMENDED!xt is the epic title cut which is the nine minute ode to the plow horses with every influence thrown in (rock, classical, folk and even a fiddle induced romp (which the disco loving sheep didn't get))!

B000OT8GCQ|2.0|This is the most depressing book I've ever read. By the time I was done with it, I was sad and mad about all the unfortunate events that John had to go through and yet he can still be so generous and love the other unconditionally. I mean.. really?? I know it's fiction, but it's a bit unrealistic there. I understand that with a memorable ending, it will make readers come back for more, but this just about crossed the line for me. This is the first Nicholas Sparks book that I don't like. I would have given it 1 star, but he is a great storyteller so I say 2.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|I am not even close to qualified as a metal critic, but I can say I paid full price for this album and would purchase it again if I lost access to my files.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've been an all-time Nicholas Sparks fan. I must say Safe Haven is a bit different from his usual style. Having read almost all of his books, I expected this one to be another memorable love story. This is a love story, but rather than putting weight on how the two main characters fall in love, I think the highlight of this whole story is how the main character gets her freedom. This is the first Nicholas Sparks book that has a thrill to it at the end, which made putting the book down and get to bed a very hard task. And just as you thought the story would end as you predicted, you'll find that there's a twist to it. All in all, another a great story and it was worth having dark circles around my eyes the next morning. =p
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love finding new recipes, hair styles, DIY crafts, and jokes! Be sure to check out the category \\"Geek\\", it's hilarious!!!
B00051E906|4.0|This is worth the asking price, the only reason that it does not get five stars is because the English in the owner's manual is poor. I compared this unit with a state of the art unit used for laboratory and environmental monitoring and it was shockingly dead-on. Very pleased and I fully trust the readings. It will not pick up alpha so several \\"sources\\" will not register. The cost of the included GM tube is about what the whole unit costs and it's not poorly constructed either. I would not drop it or generally toss it around like a phone though. It will operate on one or two AAA batteries which is kinda interesting but the battery life appears to be great. DO NOT put one in backwards as you would with other devices, this will cause them to overheat. They are in PARALLEL and not SERIES meaning if you put one in backwards you have just shorted the + & - together. On a new set of batteries they WILL overheat and leak all over if you do this. The orientation is clearly marked on the battery compartment. Seriously, RTFM if unsure.

B008BM9L72|1.0|Although the story line was interesting and this book could have been used to provide a close up on the character of successful but very damaged individuals, the story was ruined by a lack of any writing skill and pathetic editing allowing for tedious repetition and virtually now character development. What a disappointment.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Just a heads up...if you are buying this album the song PAYPHONE is very explicit...even using the F word. They do NOT have the radio version of this song which I loved so much.. I think this was a dumb thing to do. I can't play it around my kids due to this....but I love the album otherwise and just listen on my iPod at the gym

B009B50QOU|5.0|Green Day is often a Love / Hate band for people. Their last two albums seemed to cause that effect with their fans as well. People usually stacked up on the sides of \\"old-school\\" Green Day vs \\"punk rock opera\\" Green Day. As a fan who has enjoyed both immensely, it is no surprise to me that I very much enjoy this homage to the classic roots of the band.<br /><br />Green Day has always been \\"accessible\\" punk and, unlike hipsters, I don't judge a band by popularity. These songs are punk-poppy and accessible to the nth degree. You won't find any songs that really push the envelope or make you feel like you are overthrowing the establishment. That being said, this is a thoroughly enjoyable album with a lot of replay value. I've listened to it about 6 times now and it has grown on me even more with each play-through.<br /><br />It's not their best album but it ranks up there with Nimrod. (This album reminded me a lot of a blend of Nimrod and Warning which makes sense given that those were their last two studio albums with a traditional punk flavor.)<br /><br />I'm probably on the older side of their fanbase having grown up listening from Kerplunk onward so, like the band, I have mellowed with age. This album reflects that very well and, I remain, a lifelong fan.

B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Reacher is always entertaining. His \\"alternative lifestyle\\" approach to life, combined with his military and policing skills, continue to make him enjoyable to read about. Much of the continuing interest in the series, I  am sure, lies in the continuing desire of readers like me, who want to stay in touch with this interesting man.<br />That said, this is a less than stellar part of the series. Far too long a build-up before the discovery of the FBI involvement and far too standard a climax.<br />Better luck next time, Reacher.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I am a fan of Kathy Reichs and will always read her latest book. This one was disappointing because there was page afer page of technical descriptions that were very boring to me. I expect more action and less description that I got with this book. I enjoy her books and have always got my moneys worth from her. This one didn't even have Birdie in it except to say he was sick. The cats antics are good for a chuckle because they are what cats do and only someone who has cats would know these things. Ryan was so disasociated from her and Ollie was just obnoxlous with no real meat to him. Not her best book by far.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Truthly, I became a bit bored with the writing.  It took me four days to read the book when I usually finished one of these books in about 6 hours.  It appeared that Mr. Child has become a bit lazy. Granted I am a female, 70 years old but it's really hard for me to remember the plot.  One thing I do remember is Jack being described as a 'gorilla' and I try to picture Tom Cruize in this role and I just laugh.  To  date, I have bought and read (along with my husband) all of Lee Child's books & short stories about Reacher.  I think I'll get in line at the library for the next one.  Thank goodness I saved the 12 or so dollars by buying the Kindle version.

B001DDBCUA|5.0|I'm totally satisfied with the dvd I recently purchased of Sex in the City.  I ordered the movie new so I wasn't expecting any problems with it and I didn't have any.<br /><br />I would give it a 5 star rating so you're talking to a very<br />satisfied customer!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book was a good read but I think the author is putting a lot on the line for himself and others involved.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|It's fun yet hard.  It's surprisingly not easy. Nice game,  I played it on the capper until my birthday went numb.
B008XG1X18|5.0|has become my new obsession. such great ideas and products. I look at it several times a day. very much recommended.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|Bought it (on my prime account) and had it overnight shipped. Came in next day as expected. Plug and play with windows 8 (no drivers or disc needed). Works great and gets signal very quickly. I use it in my car (with my carputer). Not a single complaint, and the magnetic base is perfect for vehicle use. For windows 7, just hit the site for drivers and avoid the dated ones on the disc it is shipped with. That's it, great device, great price, fast shipping. Happy customer!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Enjoyed  was good read, did not care for ending.  Got no satisfaction,  guess I wanted Amy to get caught and brought to justice for what she did.  Think they were both flawed, but she of<br />course really had issues dating back to her childhood.  I felt sympathy for his character (Nick) and how for sake of his child he was going to spend rest of his life with this nut job and<br />murderer.  But book was a page turner and got me through a long 8 hour plane ride.
B00457WZEI|4.0|A good book, however, it was kind of sad.<br />A good medium sized book, it only took me a couple hours to read.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Awesome game!  I love hidden object games and this one is at the top of my list.  Highly recommend.  Great job Big Fish Games!
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|First, this movie is awesome and worth $20. I spend more than that on beer in one night and that beer doesn't last nearly two hours. Money well spent. The digital copy that comes with it, however, is a whole other story... Knocked down two stars for this. Read on.<br /><br />The digital copy that comes with this purchase is a separate disc that you must put into your computer that links to iTunes and (after intputting the code) downloads a digital copy of the movie to your computer. A few notes:<br />- I have a MacBook Air that doesn't have an optical drive, hence why I need the digital version. But wait, I need an optical drive to get the digital version? Fail.<br />- The digital copy is STANDARD DEFINITION -- not 720 or 1080 HD, but standard definition. For a visually stunning movie like this, that's an atrocity. Given the high-resolution displays and large storage space on all portable media, it is completely stupid that your only choice in watching the movie on your portable device is SD. One star down.<br />- You can only download the digital copy ONCE. If your computer crashes and the movie isn't backed up, you have to buy it again, which is totally bogus. When I bought Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, I got a digital coupon through iTunes that officially \\"purchased\\" the movie, which means that I can re-download the movie at any time, which is freaking awesome. A second star down.<br /><br />Movie win, price win, total digital copy fail.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|A quick, easy read but very enjoyable. It made me stop, think, and reconsider my own life. Would read more by this author.
B004H1V5RU|3.0|I ordered this as a gift for my nephew.  I live out of state and shipped directly to him.  It got there on time, but the new product was cracked.  It is usable, and if it would have been for myself I probably wouldn't have cared, but it's a bummer when it's for a gift. And a gift for a kid.  I am kind of getting tired of receiving 'broken' merchandise, more from the stand point that I wonder if it was broken in transit or if the company is selling it that way.<br />I am not sure how much he enjoys the gift (11 years old).  The rest of the family pitched in to buy an X-box, so it was hard to compete with that.  This review is strictly on the basis that the toy arrived cracked.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Really,this book is nonsense,I can't understand what all the fuss is about.It's just porn sex,money wasted I felt.Don't waste your time or money on trash like this
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is perfect for people addicted to taking photos!! The app allows you to modify a single picture in hundreds of different ways! You can also add clipart pictures, stickers, you can draw, and make collages!!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Short and not captivating... complicated story that don't really make sense and it lost me at one point.  Feeling it was made for a fast buck,building on past successes.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very addicting. love the sound effects. maybe would be fun to add a claw game for bonus action? but great game
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the devotional plans that come with the app.  For music lover's, I definitely recommend doing the overflow devotion.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I got pretty tired of driving the interstate back and forth with jack and various characters!  Seems like it was night 23 hrs of the time.  preposterous plot.  Not up to Lee Childs usual standards.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|This was not the pac man I expected. Now I'm trying to get it off my kindle. May be ok for small kids who like racing games.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|The last person you want to pick up on a highway is Jack Reacher if you have something to hide and are on the wrong side of the law.  This novel is another in a long list by Lee Child which showcases the many talents and and deductive powers of its central character.
B007UXT6O6|4.0|I thought this movie about a sex addict was very good.  It is a depiction on how some sex addicts live in the real world, but at least in this case he only ruins his life and his sister, not like other stories in which lots of other people are involved.  Overall a good film and great acting from Michael Fassbender.  His other great role was the android David in Prometheus.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is one of the best apps I've used for remote desktop... works great on my 4g and perfectly on WiFi.. if you need remote desktop services then this is for you... OK now stop asking me to rate this app when I open it lol..
B002L5KKK2|4.0|It was very clear that the writers and directors were very familiar with the way of life that existed back then in the Bronx and through out parts of New York City. I grew up in the Bronx during the same time period the story took place. Though it only centered around two ethnic groups, it worked very well and brought back many good and hard memories. The timeline was supported with believable sets and props. We may not like the social woes that affected us all back then but put that aside and you have a movie with a real story, notable cast and an excellent delivery.<br />HV
B003O86FMW|5.0|The ending was a great twist . always keeps you thinking and wanting ti turn the page! great fun book
0525953728|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. Many people will talk about the politics of this book or just about how servicemen are the best. But to review the book, I enjoyed it very much. It's written like an auto biography where he goes through his career building up to the last mission. I would recommend this book to friends who have in interest in war, armed forces, compelling stories, navy SEALs. Don't hesitate to buy this book, its worth your money and your time.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read this because everyone is talking about it. The book is ok - easy and quick read. Somewhat entertaining but definitely not the best book I've ever read!
0399213015|5.0|This is a classic! I loved this book as a child and love it.  I still read it today to my children, and they love it as well.  However, I do correct 1 word: cocoon should be chrysalis...or butterfly should be moth.  I know neither have sweet ring to them, but children AND school teachers are learning the wrong word.  During the pupa stage, a caterpillar is encased in a chrysalis and a moth is encased in a cocoon.
B000HIVQBC|5.0|I had to stop and write a quick opinion about this amazing album. If you are a lover of electronic music and understand that every DM album cant be exactly the same as the last then please try it. Very heart felt songs and laid back (in a way). Yes you cant exactly dance to every track but try a few hits and lay back with eyes closed. It will take you places in your mind. Don't get me wrong because at least half of the tracks are no doubt club worthy. As with most DM songs the layering and changes are truly ahead of its time. Songs of Faith and Devotion holds its own all these years later.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very good book. Gives an inside view of how special ops units work and what they give for all of us. As a former USMC special ops officer I would recommend this book without reservation.
B007SSDBBM|3.0|Not to much romance - could have used a few more kisses  ;-)  Hugh, of course is always awesome.  Meg's hair looked like crap throughout the whole movie.  What's up with that?
B008IYR2BA|5.0|We love Dexter and have seen all the seasons as soon as they are released.  I wasn't disappointed in this one, or any of the others I have seen/purchased over the years.  I love that I can get seasons of my fave shows when I want!
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I am so glad I purchased this music! I had barely heard of Imagine Dragons, but they won me over the second I began to hear their music. Their sound is very original and captivating. I find myself listening to their album over and over again.
B0095R64AO|3.0|Not a total waste of time and money, but close.  I really do like the actors (most of them) starring in this, but it seemed the female lead was all wrong, and it just wasn't that funny.  I can see what they were TRYING to do, but they missed the mark with this one.  There were MOMENTS, maybe 5 that made me laugh, maybe only 3 now that I think about it.  I ended up not really feeling for the characters and didn't care if they got married or not.  It was just sad that this movie could have been something more, but it just wasn't good.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|great! lots of fun and a nice way to kill some time when it is available. classic hack n slash!
B005LF9OCE|5.0|Without giving anything away, I was impressed with this season of HIMYM just like all the rest.  Well worth the money to watch the whole season whenever I wanted.
B0087JTAKW|1.0|What a boring book! The concept is pretty interesting, but the author has no ability to create characters the reader even remotely cares about. It's almost like listening to a lecture about a passable story. A very boring lecture that deteriorates into nonsense and never gets better. This book had such potential and left me hating it. I read it out loud to my wife and about half way through I kept thinking, \\"Why am I wasting my life energy, my TIME on this drivel?\\" Do yourself a favor and find another book by an author you trust.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Hawkeye, and Black Widow. Great characters, great acting, great script, GREAT MOVIE! Simply put, THE AVENGERS... Nuff said.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|This is the first album of the Band Perry that I have purchased.  They have a wonderful sound, and I like all of the songs.  I look forward to hearing more from them.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|this is a great Bible app for all ages. the only thing is that u have to be nonlinear for it to work.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|Battle Born was worth the wait.  Took a few listens to really appreciate it  The last track 'Battle Born' is my favorite but their really isn't a bad song on here.  Not sure about the negative reviews either.  Even the slower songs on here are great!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Upgrade your 3D DVD Blu-Ray player with firmware immediately. It will boost the performance of the 3D Blu-Ray device. It did for my LG Blu-Ray player from Amazon that was not ready for release when I bought it. My LG 3D TV from amazon could have better volume.<br /><br />Avengers has most excellent 3D. It has some of the best FX I have ever seen. However, I grew up with Viewmaster and want 3D in my face all the time. Want to bob and weave things coming at me. Want to blink in the face of FX. The more 3D the better. Bullets, swords, spears and fists reaching out is the 3D for me.<br /><br />The cinema is not equipped to handle 3D like your 3D TV and your 3D Blu-Ray player are. Trust me.<br />Go to all the 3D movies. Have seen every single 3D movie in the last couple of years. And I have inquired why the 3D was lousy at the theaters. Simple. The cinema only has regular screens that are analog.<br /><br />John Carter is a 3D movie I bought from Amazon. Before the fix/patch/update of firmware John Carter had almost no 3D. After the patch (etc) it had good 3D. Not excellent mind you but light years better than before the patch (etc).<br /><br />All the new 3D movies are improvements over the former 3D movies released over a year ago. The studios are on a learning curve or claiming to be. Bought some educational 3D DVDs about a year ago and the effects were fabulous without the patch (etc).<br /><br />Maybe 3D will usher in a new phase of Hollywood, by passing the cinema with direct releases to the retail outlets. Great. Bravo.<br /><br />Formula: Don't go to the cinema. Buy the retail release. Firmware your Blu-Ray 3D player and 3D TV. Kick back and enjoy the flick. And always watch at eye level for the best possible 3D experience.

B0045HCJQW|5.0|This must be one of the all-time greatest films ever produced. It is quick, clever and fun. The actors are brilliant (and beautiful). I would suggest this movie for anyone. I have shown it to a variety of other people now, and everyone loves it!

1401322786|5.0|[[ASIN:1401322786 The Time Keeper]]<br /><br />I have a Love/Hate relationship with Mitch Albom. I love his books but I wish he'd be more prolific. Each and every time I read his books I learn something. While laying in a Hospital bed I read \\"one More day\\" straight through. My 22 year old son has taken to his books too. They always create huge amounts of conversations between us and have only brought to close people closer together. When I finished the book (2 days after my son finished it) I sent him a text message asking him....at this point in your life, what moment would be seen in that one grain of sand ?
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Once I heard that Joss would be behind this project, I knew it would turn out good. I have watched his works from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel and found that he really does know how to capture the characters and tell the story well. You don't get that very often. Most of the time there are directors who butcher the characters beyond recognition. Then you will be left with something that somebody made in their backyard with their portable camera (you all know how those look all shaking, low budget, b rated movies). This movie was well thought out and has great quality. You will not be disappointed because each character is the exact same way as in their individual movies. There is no doubt that we will have a sequel. The way the movie was set up and the way it ended was like an introduction to the main event. I can't wait!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have gotten so many good ideas from pinterest. Anything you want, I could easily spend hours and hours on it but have to make myself stop.
B008J34466|4.0|Love this album, the track with the lead singer of Fun is blow me away amazing \\"Just give me a Reason\\"....! Keep in mind purchasers this is an explicit album and generally I would say this is not appropriate for younger listeners/pre-teens. Also, I wasn't thrilled by the Eminem collaboration as I'm not a fan, but that's a subjective issue, although it is my main reason for giving this album a 4 out of 5.
B008E374PO|2.0|I must preface this negative review with some facts.  My wife and I are big Owl City fans.  We also really like his Sky Sailing Album.  Adam Young is mega talented and has provided us with a lot of musical enjoyment on many car trips.  We both find his music innocent, catchy, refreshing and very fun to listen to.  I am a musician, very much into palatable prog rock, and Christian music that's not played on K-Love (i.e hip hop, metal, and world music styles).<br /><br />That said, with the exception of about 6 songs, this album was a total let down.  For me the cover art is very nice and normally the cover art of an Owl City (or Sky Sailing) album is a visual taste of the music to come...something whimsical, imaginitive...an innocent escape from reality--the vehicle being Adam Young's intoxicating electro synth pop and incredible production.<br /><br />Not the case this time around :(  The music is extremely trite, flat, and bland and the lyrics leave a lot to be desired. No \\"story brush...paint the dusk Venitian blue...\\" type lyrics here; no 7/8 time siganture on any bridges (i.e. \\"Real World\\") or cool sychopations or break downs.  It's mostly musical and lyrical high fructose corn syrup. When I listen to some of the songs, I feel like I'm at the mall (i.e. surrounded by teeny boppers) or at a high school dance in the mid '90s (ala Real McCoy or Ace of Base).  Not exactly what used to come to mind when thinking of Owl City.  Unfortunately, with this album he has just blended in with the rest of the trite pop music that is out there and will soon be forgotten.<br /><br />Okay, now for the good songs:<br /><br />-Shooting Star:  Very upbeat and the lyrics and melody are very uplifting.  One of my favorites.<br /><br />-Gold:  A bit trite, but very catchy and again uplifting<br /><br />-Dementia:  A Relient K-esque ditty with the whismical abstract Owl City lyrics I've come to enjoy.<br /><br />-Sillouhette:  A melancholy ballad, but with great lyrics and a nice melody...ala Vanilla Twilight.<br /><br />-Metropolis: This one is in the mixolydian mode!  So that's already get's it on my good side.  Very Euro-pop, but the mixolydian mode gives it a less mainstream top 40 feel.<br /><br />-Take it All Away:  Another melancholy joint, but very well put together.<br /><br />As for the rest of the songs...they honestly make me cringe.  I don't understand why he would decide to go in this direction.  It really pains me.  But, I hope and pray Adam will return to his musical roots next time around and stick to working with like minded peeps (i.e. the cats from \\"Swimming with Dolphins\\" and other side projects).<br /><br />Still looking forward to your future work, Adam.  Thanks for the sound track to many memorable road trips with my wife :)...ala Vanilla Twilight.<br /><br />-Metropolis: This one is in the mixolydian mode!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|***If you pre-ordered this for $29.96 like I did, just go to the help section and set up a live chat (easiest and fastest) or send an email explaining that you pre-ordered it for $29.96 and it is now on sale for $19.96. They will credit you the difference, it is Amazon's policy on all items. So don't complain.***<br /><br />This is a great Blu-Ray. It looks as good as any Blu-ray out there (exception of Baraka). The 3D is great and will go head to head with Transformers: Dark of The Moon in terms of crystal clear special effects in bright, sunny 3D. The menu load up is great in 3D. in fortunately have not had time to go into special features yet but for 19.99 you get 4 discs (one in 3D) and special features shouldn't necessarily hinder that decision.
1575666286|5.0|Nice book. Motivating and inspiring. It brings lots of hope to reality! It validates our common sense but gives direction and support. I loved it!
B007SGM084|5.0|Go ahead, order the Trilogy, you won't want to stop reading for a second.  A very fun read and I am hear to tell you it's HOT, HOT, HOT!
B0084AZXKK|4.0|\\"Treasure Island\\" is a great story that I've read a few times - a well-written, fun adventure, with clear descriptions and characterisation, and characters you can side with.  It has one or two racist comments, similar to the novel \\"King Solomon's Mines\\", but if you can overlook that it is an enjoyable read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm on the third book and I can't put it down.  These books are very sensual but they also have a story line and plot which holds your interest.  If they were all about sex, I think you would quickly lose interest.  I have thoroughly enjoyed them.
0385737955|5.0|The Maze Runner is such a captivating novel, especially for teens. It has a ton of action and suspense. I really couldn't put it down. I immediately continued to the next 2 sequels. It's such an interesting story and once you start reading it, it's almost impossible to stop. I highly recommend this book to people of all ages!
B0078XFYDA|5.0|With scientific knowledge dwindling in the average persons mind in America, I think this book ought to be required reading, especially in schools-preferably at he middle school level. One of Dawkins' most important works.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|What can I say, it was a great book, a quick & easy, fun read.  Go ahead and read it, it doesn't give away anything that we didn't already know.  But it's great being in the action and having that first hand account of such historic events.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|As a faithful Reacher fan, I was diasppointed in A Wanted Man. I thought the resolution was fuzzy and the narrative somewhat tedious. There's lots of driving around in Kansas and Missouri, along with the usual deceptive presentation of the \\"real\\" roles of the good and bad guys. In the end, after the one-man-against-overwhelming-odds-shootout, it was not really clear how the original murder led into the ensuing plot.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is fun right from the beginning.  played this game until the battery died.  definitely suggest this to anyone.
B00932AA5G|5.0|This is an excellent, highly entertaining movie. It's a thriller with action, romance, drama and intrigue as well. The cast were great and belivable. I didn't want it to end and exclaimed out loud, more than once, \\" this is a great movie,\\". Watch it, you won't  be sorry.
0061733199|5.0|One of the best books written on survival that I've read! Easy to follow directions, nice pictures, with clear and consise instructions. If you screw up in the field...it's probably because you didn't read this book! I especially liked the chapter on building emergency shelters. I bought the full sized version for my husband, now I'm going to purchase the smaller version for my backpack. Even if you don't go camping or hiking, this is just a great must have book to read!
B006SAR6P8|5.0|blah blah blah this movie's f'ing awesome. Watch it. In HD though. And if you haven't watched the first one, do that immediately as well- even better in my opinion
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It's not as kinky as I thought it would be. If anyone read the Twilight series, this is Edward & Bella as very sexual non-vampires. He's movie star gorgeous, tortured, dark, melancholy....but can be tender, playful & sweet. He plays the piano (only melacholy tunes, of course). He's ridiculously wealthy, adopted,  jealous. Ana is a bit annoying, obviously not realizing her effect on him. Oh, and she's a virgin; and clumsy (where have I seen that before??). You know what though? I enjoyed it-it's a fun, light read & frankly, Edward & Bella were hot, & so are Christian & Ana. Enjoy it for what it is!
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|Yes I spelled terrible wrong on purpose, but honestly this movie was just awful. It can't have helped that I didn't realize it was pg or whatever before renting it, and therefore didn't get all the nudity and extremely graphic violence I was looking forward to. Anywho, the movie may be cool if you were into the books or are under the age of 9. Even though I was looking forward to imagined carnal undertones, this movie was lacking in every respect and I still stopped watching before the end, which is a big deal for me.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love being able to pin from my Kindle and having recipes at my finger tips that are easier to read than using my phone.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|although I had heard a lot about the book, I was not expecting the storyline to be so engaging. The psychological and emotion issues for Christian are real, the way in which he manages his issues are an education in it self. The book is sexually enlightening and tantalising. In parts very erotic and demeaning.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a great game! It was more than I had expected and lasted a lot longer than I thought it would

B0087HT36U|5.0|Yeah, it borrows heavily from Angry Birds - but so what. By removing the slingshot mechanic, I think they created a more fun game. My son and I were addicted! We just completed the final level and are jonesing for cowboys!
B008RV5K4U|4.0|4 stars<br /><br />One of the better DC animated adaptations<br /><br />Based on Frank Miller's classic 4 part mini-series \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\":<br />1. Batman vs. Harvey Dent<br />2. Batman vs. the Mutant gang<br />3. Batman vs. the Joker<br />4. Batman vs. Superman<br />This DVD adapts issues 1 and 2 above.<br /><br />Miller's story from 1986 is one of the two DC miniseries (the other being Watchmen) that unfortunately led comics into the so-called \\"Dark Age\\" of the 90's, when comics had the dark, gritty feel of these books while neglecting to include what actually made these two series great: realistic (well, for comics), adult, intelligent plot-lines, deep characterization, and philosophical/political speculations.  One of the things that made this series (along with Watchmen) unique in its time was that it asked questions like \\"why do super-heroes really do what they do?  Are they really \\"good\\" guys?  Are they, maybe, a little messed-up in the head?\\"  It began the \\"de-construction\\" of super-heroes, and made it impossible to look at them the same naive way again.<br /><br />The story features a Bruce Wayne in his 50's who's been \\"retired\\" as Batman for the past 10 years.  The release of Harvey Dent (previously known as \\"Two-Face\\") from prison, coinciding with an increase in crime in Gotham city (largely involving a huge street gang calling themselves \\"the Mutants\\" (an X-Men reference?)) prompts Batman to come out of retirement.  This inspires a young teenage girl, Carrie, to become a new Robin, who will join Batman in his new war on crime.  Towards the end of the film, you'll see the most intense \\"Batmobile\\" ever seen.<br /><br />The movie does a reasonably good job adapting the story, but it didn't knock my socks off, hence the 4 stars.  I think Peter Weller (Batman/Bruce) and Ariel Winter (Robin/Carrie) did fairly well as the voice actors.  Michael Emerson (Ben from \\"Lost\\") as the Joker only gets a line or two, but I think he'll do a good job in part 2 (to be released Winter of 2013?)  The artwork does a somewhat good job of matching Miller's work (at one point you get the iconic silhoutte with lightning flash from the book's cover), but it's a little too colorful in comparison with the graphic novel (dark and gritty, people!)  The CGI merges somewhat well with the cell animation, but it's a little distracting.  And yes, as other reviewers have mentioned, practically all the \\"interior dialogue\\" (and consequently a lot of the best lines) are gone.<br /><br />Single-Disc DVD extras:<br />-Unskippable (but fast-forwardable) previews for \\"Thunderstruck\\" and a miscelleneous group of DC animated features<br />-Sneak Peek of The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2<br />-Sneak Peek of Superman/Batman Public Enemies: This is an old clip that speaks of the film as if it weren't already available.<br />-Trailers for \\"Thundercats\\" and \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" and an ad for DC Comics online.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for violence.  It can be pretty brutal, and I think they had to tone it down a little from the original book to keep it below an R rating.<br /><br />If you're in a hurry to find out what happens next, you can read the original graphic novel.<br />(Note: Let's just not even talk about Miller's sequel \\"The Dark Knight Strikes Back.\\")o be released Winter of 2013?)

B008220DGE|4.0|What can I say about this film that champions the worse low-life activities, like: making sexual love to a sand castle turned into the image of a woman, and masturbating on the beach; mixing paint thinner with alcohol, and pretending that this makes the finest tonic for festive drinking.<br /><br />No, it is almost too much to admit that I watched such filth. But the sad truth is that these sick proclivities mark the human condition with realism. It was clear in watching The Master, that the lead character Freddie, struggled with these demons that are not uncommon. I could not fault this film for being realistic.<br /><br />Freddie found in Dodd, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, a true friend. Dodd was \\"a writer, a doctor, and a philosopher.\\" Dodd was a vain character, but strangely Dodd could have played myself given that my life experiences also brought me to the Dodd-like realizations, e.g., that vitalism is in fact real. I hear that the character of Dodd was intended to mock, or laud, the founder of scientology, L. Ron Hubbard.<br /><br />I did not find Dodd to be as unsavory as Freddie. In my opinion, the eccentric Dodd was portrayed as a true believer in his own brand of vitalism.<br /><br />This film was very much about the metaphysical interaction between Dodd and Freddie, otherwise this film is almost pointless to the unobservant. The interaction brought the real Freddie out of his sickness, almost. Freddie even went home to search for his long lost girl friend, that he abandoned a few years earlier. Freddie was finding his purpose, almost cured, and this realization brought satisfaction to my eyes. But the good news would not last, and the vindicated Dodd that made this happen had his weaknesses too. By the film's end, Freddie went to visit Dodd in England. Freddie could not stay and be cured further. Dodd could help no more. It was time for Freddie to return to the world, alone with his sickness.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Kept me interested all the way. Adequate plot twist well directed and portrayed. Social comments not withstanding, hopefully not our real future.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|I'm not a person who goes on a diet.  I always thought that if I would just eat less, I would be good.  (And it has never worked for me.)  Then I saw a recent photo of myself, and it was troubling how much weight I had on my body.  (that picture is on the fridge to remind me every time I open it!) So I needed something that would encourage me and something that I could stick with.  Decided to do Dunkan, 5 weeks ago and do it exactly as it required.  I have lost 16 lbs, I have more energy than I have for years.  I've got 8lbs to go to hit my goal.  Two notes:  The Attack phase, first 5-7 days is tough.  Drink more water than you can stand and you will be fine.  This is hard on your kidneys if you don't drink enough water, so don't do the Dukan if you are not going to drink (and use the bathroom) all day long.  Second, I found I needed more fiber, so I take a fiber drink 2x a day and I'm good.  Game changer for me.  I highly recommend it.  Couple of tough weeks at the start and then it gets remarkably easier and sustainable.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|A movie \\"I\\" enjoyed.  I liked it very much, had to have it on DVD.  Lot of unknowns actors but I thought they were good, I like the plot and the how it finished, maybe you will Too.

B0007TKNII|2.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber is a fine composer, and frankly one of my favorite repeat viewing experiences is Evita.  The Phantom of the Opera is a quality production, but I simply couldn't finish it.  The story line is not complex, but the length of time taken to crawl through it, together with what does not to me comprise very lively and interesting music for the most part (what is largely \\"connecting\\" music, where words are sung in barely melodic snatches merely because the medium is operatic), caused me ultimately to turn it off, satisfied that I had understood the idea well enough and somewhat frantic to end the tedium.  Some of the story line and acting insulted the intelligence, with conflicts being prolonged unrealistically and unnecessarily, and that element didn't help, either.  Anyway, this work turned out to be a large disappointment for me, all the more considering the fine body of works that have come from this man's creative pen.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Love this! Fun for my 6 yr old and myself!! It is fun while teaching..... It builds problem solving and physics skills at the same damn time!!!!!
0143117009|4.0|This is a brilliant book. It is very well laid out. The ideas in the book are so very relevant to our times. The argumentation is very well presented, and very logical indeed. The positions that Jared takes in this book are positions not to be taken lightly. The lessons from the societies that have collapsed are so very relevant to our times.<br /><br />Yet, the one thing that was missing for me, is the effect of the sudden increase of our global population in the last 150 years, on the stresses that the world's environment must face today. The pressure on the world's resources is so dramatically different from the pressures of all the centuries ago. I am sure that with the seeming decrease in western populations, global migrations etc, the ways in which we will regard the problems of today, be different from the world of 200 years ago.<br /><br />All in all, a highly recommended book. It is a book to be read slowly, with care. The lessons are to be absorbed, not forgotten when the book is put down.

B004QL7K70|1.0|The thrill of throwing an epic party for your high school friends - and then some - cannot be overstated and is a defining moment of one's adolescence.  As a youth of somewhat reasonable intelligence I always made sure the parties I helped coordinate were at a friend's house - never my own.  I remember quite fondly one such event my junior year I helped put together that almost ended without a single mishap, until one of the last partygoers drunkenly punched a hole through my friend's living room wall as he was stumbling out the door.  Needless to say my friend's parents weren't thrilled when they came home the next day and weren't fooled by the repositioned portrait over the gaping hole.<br /><br />So here we have \\"Project X,\\" a comedy by Nima Nourizadeh of the found-footage variety that reminds us that if you crowd a house with a bunch of unsupervised high school kids a lot of bad things are going to happen.<br /><br />Parties are risky but if done right can do wonders for your social credibility.  Enter Thomas (Thomas Mann), Costa (Oliver Cooper) and J.B (Jonathan Daniel), three friends looking to boost their popularity and score with a bunch of hot chicks.  It's Thomas' birthday and it just so happens to coincide with his parents' anniversary.  When they plan to leave for the weekend allowing Thomas and a few of his friends to enjoy the house, Costa comes up with the brilliant idea to throw the Greatest Party Eva'.<br /><br />If you've seen the trailers or MTV spots you know what happens.  A large gathering quickly spins out of control as more than a thousand people converge on small house vibrating to the beats of the party's DJ.  All of this is shown through the digital lens of a hired cameraman because for some reason they want to capture their criminal exploits - which include buying drugs and getting completely wasted - on camera.<br /><br />Under it all \\"Project X\\" is an ugly, mean spirited film.  The main characters were clearly inspired by the trio from the much superior film - and that's saying a lot - \\"Superbad.\\"  But unlike those social outcasts there is nothing likable about these miscreants.  Thomas could be sensible as the skinny shy kid but only acts for his own self-interests.  Costa impersonates Jonah Hill's Seth from the aforementioned film but without the humor or insightful angst.  He's just mean and gets off on insulting others, especially J.B. for his portliness.  And J.B. is just your nice, overweight geek looking for a little companionship.<br /><br />The movie is overtly misogynistic as most of the female characters are shown exclusively from the neck-down, whether grinding on the dance floor or swimming topless in the pool, and in one example a girl exposes her thong while ascending a staircase in slow-motion.  I hope that cameraman was well-compensated for his voyeurism.  When the film isn't reducing women to body parts, it's showcasing a midget getting stuffed into an oven, a dog being carried away by helium balloons, and anyone with a shred of intelligence unfortunate enough to be near the party getting tazed in the neck.  None of this - and this is the important part - is the least bit funny or entertaining.<br /><br />While this visual abomination is complimented by an excellent soundtrack of pulsing techno and hip-hop, it doesn't stave off the boredom that sets in long before the SWAT team and guy with a flamethrower arrive.  Besides, if I wanted to watch a 90-minute music video I'd waste my time on YouTube instead of this pseudo-porn.<br /><br />The most aggravating thing about \\"Project X\\" is how the action is completely devoid of consequences.  Kids get hammered on booze, slam ecstasy like it's candy, vomit uncontrollably and vandalize property with no payoff.  No one learns anything.  There is no purpose.<br /><br />The last straw for me was how this supposedly unconventional film with its low-budget indie vibe titled \\"Prjoect X\\" relies all-too heavily on the tired cliche of the main character - as flawed an unlikeable as he is - getting the incredibly hot girl.  In this case we have Kirby (Kirby Blanton), one of the few females allowed to show her face and I believe the only female allowed to speak.  She walks in on Thomas as he's in the process of getting laid by another girl in an upstairs bedroom.  She understandably walks out in disgust and promptly ends their relationship.  Thomas realizes how badly he messed things up, so much so that not even his weak speech at the end of the movie will be able to win her back.  Oh wait...<br /><br />I once watched a kid punch a hole through my friend's wall for no reason.  At least we learned something that night and appreciated the experience of throwing party we probably shouldn't have.  The characters in this film learned nothing and became worse for it.  Hopefully that's not the case for all the kids who were inspired by it to throw their own debacles.acter - as flawed an unlikeable as he is - getting the incredibly hot girl.

B008LZHA3G|4.0|This has got to be one of the most interesting of Mr. Dylan's recent musical offerings.  Mostly very bluesey with the sandpaper voice to maintain one's concentration on said item, to comprehend the message given here.  He still sings the blues, mostly without being sad.  Takes a real artist!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is an easy read, that keeps one interested in the plot. The reader comes to a chapter ending, but is driven to read on into the next chapter.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|It's a given that with any series character novels the hero will fall into more bizarre trouble than would any ordinary human in similar circumstance. This is where the willing suspension of disbelief becomes part of the writer/reader contract. Many of these contracts break down over time because of the strain on credulity created by constant complicated plots and seemingly bulletproof heroes.<br /><br />Reacher is different. For while Child carves his hero from the same cloth as other can't scratch `em heroes, he manages to put a real person inside the clothes. Neither likeable nor unlikeable, Reacher's strange and simple rules, and Child's extraordinary ability to weave a complicated, twisting plot/narrative and place interesting, real people inside it is the touchstone of the crime/mystery writer's art.
B00932A2MC|2.0|Nice graphics but really bad acting and script.  Really unbelievable and I love sci-fi so it's really hard for me to be disappointed.  Well I was disappointed.  I had to remind myself that this was not a b movie, but an expensive Hollywood production that just really stunk!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This movie is one of my all-time favorites!  The dvd arrived in great condition and on time.  If you get a chance to buy this, by all means, do it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I am finding no problem with the game what so ever. The animations are great. Yes, it takes awhile for the energies to build up, but then what do you expect? Most of the games you play on Facebook take energies in some way, shape,  or form. Sit back,  relax and enjoy the game. It was free for crying out loud!
B0092BBCWS|4.0|This type of story, written in an antiquated style, can be a bit difficult to read.  You really have to take your time in comprehending how things are written and explained.  But overall, I enjoyed the story and the unraveling of the mystery.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Like many others I am a Lee Child fan but this book is terrible.  His last effort was pretty bad but A Wanted Man is not worth buying or reading.  Has he gotten to the point where like Dean Koontz, he just writes drivel and knows it will make him another million or two.  This is strike two on Child.  After strike three I will quit buying his books all together.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I believe I've read all of Mr. Childs\\" books, and each of them has been a great read.  I don't know why there aren't a whole bunch of movies made from his works, Probably because Lee Marvin is no longer alive to play \\"Reacher\\"

0646497855|4.0|This is a must have book. It gives insight to how the exam is conducted and how the markings are done. Once you go through it you will have fair confidence on how to answer questions so that you can score the best out of what knowledge you have. Sample questions are good with answers for guidance. I will definetly recommend. If you have tried to score but could not get enough then this book is for you. It will tell you how you can improve.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|I just finished watching this movie and it is fantastic. Lots of adventure, terrific special effects, and lots of fun. It is every bit as good as the first three, and possibly better. I recommend it highly.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Eagerly awaited the new Jack Reacher story, however although I enjoyed it i didnt feel it was quite as pacy as usual.I am a huge Lee Childs fan and have not found another writer whose major character is as interesting as Jack. Must say am not impressed with the thought of Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher in the film to be made. Read the descriptions of Jacks physique and then think of Tom Cruise, it just dosent work, I will definitely give the film a miss.
B008DVJO8C|1.0|If you liked \\"A Star Crossed Wasteland\\", you might like this. If this is your first listen to ITM and you are disappointed, try their first two albums. They were amazing. Less screams on the second, but the same great style overall. Great addictive hooks and choruses.<br />It seems like maybe the band wanted some less technical songs for filler on the stage. I'm excited for new CD's from bands I love, but I would rather they take a couple years to create something that really blows me away.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Boring until the end of the book, then it finally got a little \\"Reacheresk\\". If they really decide to use Tom Cruise for the part of Jack Reacher in the movie, I will not be going to see that one unless somehow he manages to grow about 2 foot taller and put on about 150 lbs...........

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher is a great character Lee Child has created. They are a fun read.  He is sort of like a super hero and you can't help liking him despite his living outside the law.  I hope its not true that Tom Cruise has been slated to play Reacher in the first ever Reacher film.  It wouldn't fit the picture of the man the books have given me.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I have had the product 5 months now and have had no issues whatsoever. I even bought a new PC and it worked just as well. I have XLR Microphone plugged in and I use a AIWA Home Stereo (AUX) rca jacks plugged into Stereo output of mixer. It is absolutely fantastic to watch Youtube videos, listen to music with incredible sound through the stereo and do Podcasts. I have been told to use Stereo Monitor speakers but I have had no issues routing AIWA stereo into Mixer. I would advise downloading Low Latency driver from Behringer website, the recordings I made sound better with it. I have watched several videos where people have advised to use your existing pc sound card for recording purposes and route rca plugs back into PC, but for my use, The USB sound card provided by Behringer has been fine. When I have extra cash, I might invest in top sound card and try using this method.<br /><br />* Note I had two Alesis USB Mixers that both stopped working after a few months and were total trash<br />but in fairness, plugging my AIWA speakers into this unit, might have shorted or destroyed units.<br /><br />* Also I just read another review and noticed that they downloaded the Low latency driver from Behringer and lost mic gain, I was under impression this was to help sound quality but you may not want to download latency driver.

B0083SBJXS|4.0|I love this movie.  That said, I am extremely disappointed at the one-liner in the movie when Thor, in reply to Black Widow when she admonishes Loki for killing \\"80 people in two days\\" says, \\"he's adopted\\".  I remember being in the movie theater when this got a big laugh.  The laugh didn't come from me.  Since I have adopted family members I didn't find it funny or okay.  Shame on the filmmakers for allowing this.  Not cool.<br /><br />As for the rest of the movie, I love it.  Really liked Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk and though the Iron Man character is more Robert Downey than Tony Stark, I like enjoy how it works in this film.<br /><br />All characters were continued from the previous movies, maybe with the exception of the Hulk.  Thor is still comedic and naive and not arrogant.  I never liked Thor's arrogance so that works well for me too.  Works well as a movie character.  The Black Widow character is very strong.  There are two exceptional fight sequences with Black Widow.  One is in this movie, the other in Ironman II.  Loki is not very strong, but acted well.  Great grin!  How does Black Widow deceive Loki so easily?<br /><br />Shield and Nick Fury are appropriately \\"government\\" and the story makes that clear.  Agent Colson is a big star in these movies.  He has a collection of superhero items.  More great humor there!<br /><br />Marvel studios really pulled this one together well from the other individual movies.<br /><br />Once in a while the narrations are a little too obvious.  Hulk tells the story of how he tried to end his life as one example.  Everybody looks surprised, but this is just meant for us to know Hulk's character in this movie.  That happens a little more often than necessary, but it's only a minor distraction.<br /><br />Really enjoy this movie and now that it's out on Blu-ray I'm already enjoying it over again.<br /><br />It's a shame that Marvel couldn't have done something to about the inexcusable insensitivity.  That line will do damage and there's no excuse for it.<br /><br />Looking forward to Deadpool!!
B005FITIK0|4.0|Diablo cody had written another fine script after \\"Juno\\" supported by the assured direction of Jason Reitman and a superb<br />Charliz Theron.  Using a pass-her-prime former highschool beauty hitting career dud in Mini-Apple, returning to her small home town face-off with her past life as a vehicle, the story tells a lot about life, choices made, destiny and human fragility.  Charliz Theron has firmly established herself as a solid character actor.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|It truly feels like I've lost two very close friends that I came to know and love. I almost stopped reading the first book becasue it was so repetitive, but as you explore the characters you realize that the first book had to be the way it was. In the end the characters really developed and pulled you in to become a part of their world.

B008OTTSX4|2.0|I swear this is probably the worst cover album from \\"professional artist's\\" i've ever heard. Here is a run down of the songs, good points and bad.<br /><br />1. Carlos Santana and Jacoby Shabbix-Whomever that is-Smoke on the Water ASAP as Self Indulged Santana on The Water-The singer isn't bad but starting out you know there is trouble when another guitar chimes in over top of this classic riff. Then instead of using the double hi-hat cymbal hit they use bongos yes BONGOS, come on. Then i swear after every line the guy sings, or during the singing Santana almighty is worse than Ynwgie by soloing over top of the lyrics. And the solo resembles NOTHING of Blackmores original. Just horrible!!<br /><br />2. Chickenfoot-Highway Star-Not as good as the last (bonus track) with Hughes and Vai. Why? Mainly because it's LIVE, yes on stage live. Horrible sound quality, also Chickenfoot do not have a keyboardist. But Joe Satriani (the man) does a fine job at filling in for it's absence. Record it in the studio next time guys.<br /><br />3. Glenn Hughes and Chad Smith-Maybe I'm A Leo-A little fast, and also the production is a little loud for this song. Glenn Hughes sounds good, but the rest of it is uninspired. And all the vocal ad libs are quite annoying as with most of the singing. Chad Smith also pounds a bit TO hard.<br /><br />4. Black Label Society-Pictures Of Home-Not sure why they totally changed this song to an up and down countrified version, you could actually skip along to it. Zakk doesn't sound awful, but it sounds silly and folkish. Which makes it a big dump of crap, yet again.<br /><br />5. Kings Of Chaos-Never Before-Not bad for a band i've never heard of. Though the beginning riff is totally wrong from the original. As for the rest of the song, it's one of the better ones.<br /><br />6. Flaming Lips-Smoke On The Water-One word-WHY? 4 more-Pile Of Horse Dung.<br /><br />7. Joey Banomassa and Jimmy Barnes-Lazy-You would think guys who specialize in blues could dothis song some credit, but it sounds nothing like the original song. And no one can seem to even come close to emulating Jon Lords keyboard beginning. Not even Deep Purple. Nor any of his solos in the song. Singing is pretty decent. Can't save it though.<br /><br />8. Iron Maiden-Space Truckin'-I've never known who really INFLUENCED Maiden, but i never dreamed Deep Purple would be one of the bands. The song doesn't sound bad, but it's still not very good, why? Because it sounds like Iron Maiden covering Space Truckin'. :) Not your vocal style Bruce.<br /><br />9. Metallica-When A Blind Man Cries-(B-Side)-(recorded during the sessions)-Of course Metallica the mighty have to be different and not do a song that people would know, as usual. But is this bad? Nope. This is by far the best song on the album hands down. And they did their homework as usual. Metallica really do know how to cover songs, and not over do it, or under do it. They've covered many for years. So hats off to the boys, this one is good. Sounds very close to the original. And Kirk actually pulls off some great sounding Richie Blackmore tones. Also being that Ian Paice was/is a big influence on Lars, he really shows it by having the same drum sound, and playing it verbatim. :)<br /><br />10. Hughes, Chad Smith, Steve Vai-Highway Star-One wasn't enough so they did two, umm ok. But this is quite good, and is more like Highway Vai. He steals the show and does some of the best guitar work i've heard him do in years. He really shows off his licks in this song without it sounding SO over the top that is ruins the track. Just the right amount of Vai, with the right amount of original Blackmore. Glenn Hughes vocals are great, and he sounds better than ever. Though i think he gets a little TO excited on this track at times. Settle down Glenn, we're happy you can still sing. And yes, we know you sung for Deep Purple before. :)<br /><br />So that about does it for this heap of trash. Bad melodies, songs played out of time, solos and songs not even close to the originals, about sums it all up. Two decent songs equal two stars and that's all i have to say. Oh wait, in summation, don't purchase this. Just listen to them on Youtube and you'll see what i mean.
B004H4XAXO|4.0|an excellent book and a great add to the collection on the previous series ( The Mistborn Trilogy) also a Must Read.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is an intense emotional hot orgasmic story. I have focus my intention to the behavior and mental expression of Mr.Grey. There is alot I have learned from him, take my time to answer and at the same time it gives me the idea, make yourself attractive with certain moves, gestures, but never under estimate. The Red Room is some to think about, but in my fantasies I would give it a try! Read with open mind and enjoy the ride, when you want to stop-just close the book or turn of the kindle believe me is addicting ;-)
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Excellent documentary on the financial crisis in 2008.  From the interviews to the facts where banks were allowed to sell risky CDO products and allowed to insure against bad debts with credit default swaps--and then add greed and a blind eye... Mind boggling!

B004ZISVWC|1.0|I'm amazed this movie would receive a serious 5 star rating from anyone. I found it amateurishly done and with nothing at all noteworthy regarding the writing. The whole story could have been told in 30-45 minutes but was instead stretched out, without any merit, to 2 hours. It's a complete waste of time.

B000PC6A3E|5.0|Updating my DVD collection to Blu-ray and Amazon is the place to do it. Quick shipping and competitive pricing is key. This is a must have in one's collection. The Batman franchise is a series that can be watched over and over so this is worth the upgrade.
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|We've rented this film twice.  It is has a compelling story line, with very good characters.  I rented it first while the girls were shopping.  When they came home they saw the tail end, got interested and wanted to see the whole thing.  We watched it as a family and the girls really liked it too...  It is not a far fetched plot, easy to see it get played out in the real world.  We'll probably buy the Blue Ray, so we can take full advantage of the action and scenery... Sound is pretty awesome too.  Enjoy!!!
B008RYN44U|1.0|If I could have given this embarrassment 0 stars, I would have done so. I'm not going to get into a detailed preamble about the history of this band. They had 2 really great albums in the 90's, and have slowly dissolved into nothing . This album does not remotely resemble an actual band. It's Gwen in the studio with a producer. The fact that 4 band members are shown on the cover is completely misleading. They couldn't even make a complete record. The last few tracks are acoustic versions of crappy pop songs, and most likely the only songs that feature the full band. Thanks to Spotify for yet again saving me 10 bucks!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Read all three books. All were great. I read the last book in 1 week..... That's how good it was:)
B000002L7Y|5.0|This might be my favorite 80's pop CD. This is a rare CD where every track is great. I'm not normally into pop music, preferring prog-y stuff like Dream Theater or Rush, but I will listen to \\"The Sun Always Shines on TV\\" any day of the week. This is a great disc that is worth checking out!
B008602KQI|4.0|Followed the book quite closely.. well as closely i think a movie can. Most if not all fans of the book will appreciate this adaptation.
0143120530|4.0|The book is entertaining and I learned quite a bit about how people can improve their memory of things (I added \\"of things\\" because apparently you can't really improve your basic memory). It is more a story about the author and about the world of memory athletes than about actually improving your memory and, as such, it is pretty entertaining. The thing that was missing from what I wanted was a look at how he actually incorporated any of this into his everyday life. Once we see that he can memorize a list of 14 things (which I still know!), he says at a couple of points that he memorized to-do lists, but we don't *see* that. We don't see him ever try to use any of this in any practical situation.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I have read all of Lee's Reacher books and find them always entertaining.  The the right touch of wit & drama that I like in my reads.  When your talking apples for apples Lee's books about the larger than life Mr. Reacher are as exciting as any writer that I have read and that covers 40 years of books averaging about one every two weeks.  Get it you'll like it.  GBH
B000T45C32|5.0|I had read the synopsis and figured I would give this movie a shot.  Needless to say, I was incredibly surprised by how far ahead of time this movie was and how enticing it was to watch.  It is a slow-drama but the story is superb and definitely worth the time investment.
B00138J7ZC|4.0|I like to save 5 stars for really complete CDs like El Camino by the Black Keys, but this one has a handful of solid tracks. No regrets.
B0087HT36U|4.0|addictive and fun. killed hours in the airport with this. easy to control. no too hard. not too easy. good game for the average Joe.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|In a book filled with scientific theory and detailed observations, Lawrence Krauss weaves together an intricate picture of how there can be something from nothing.  Using the latest research and theory in cosmology and quantum mechanics, Krauss dives into much detail from the Big Bang to virtual particles in order to outline how the underlying physics of our universe requires that some will always come from nothing.<br /><br />Another purpose of this book is to continue a debate between scientists and philosophers/theologians on the concept of first cause (that there must be a creator/god). This is an attempt to try to prove that by the current understanding of physics, that science can now prove that there is no longer a first cause. It's not quite there yet; there are many holes to be filled, but it provides a great deal to think about.<br /><br />The book is a thick read, I personally had to read it twice. One chapter I had to read 5 times.  It isn't an easy read, but well worth it in the end.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|His worst book...by far.  Read what everybody else says. I do not have to rehash it here.  I would point out, though, that the average review of this book is 3 stars.  I went over the last 20 pages of reviews (with 3 reviews per page...on the Kindle...60 reviews) and the average review came out to be 2 stars.  Really...would you want to read a book that is only 2 stars...especially when you expect the book to be great?

B0092MKTL2|5.0|I purchased this digital album after finding it on Amazon's store for $5.00 and coming to like their debut track (\\"It's Time\\") after only a few radio plays.  I cannot stop listening to this album.  It could be my present circumstances...it could be I have been starving to find some new music...who knows.  Just buy this album.  Go see them live b/c I hate that I missed them when they recently came to Dallas.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|This the best.  It is much more complete.  It has more powers and is HD.  It has a new icecube bird. A must have for the Angry Bird fan!
B0010YPTGU|5.0|I am not a classical music fan, but I loved this DVD by Andrea Bocelli, especially \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\" with Sarah Brightman. He also sings with a couple female Italian singers which I enjoyed watching very much. The DVD also features a brilliant Chinese pianist. To me this DVD is very enjoyable. It also included a CD as well as the DVD. A good buy for any Bocelli fans out there. I bought a second copy for my cousin's wife when I learned she was a Bocelli fan.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a good introduction to learn how to play Angry Bird. It has new worlds and it fun and not to hard to play.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is better than the first Angry Birds.  It has more levels in the worlds.  It is fun and you will want to keep on playing.<br />Good reward for kids to play after they get their homework done.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Loved every book; preordered to get immediately.  The worst, most disappointing  Jack Reacher I've read.  What happened? So popular he can get away with this one?
B0058YPGL6|5.0|This show was unexpectedly great.  The teen angst is complicated with the additional problem of being a werewolf but eased with humor.  Very good series and the lack of shirts doesn't hurt.

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I kept going past this app because it just seemed silly,  but I finally succumbed and I have to admit I really enjoy the game. Mindless entertainment and strangely addicting!
B000ICXQXI|5.0|This movie has been a favorite of mine since I was about 12 years old. Back then it was really scary , but now I just watch it because of the stars in it and I love it for its entertainment value.

B000SX8BXC|5.0|Although she is best known by casual listeners for her debut album, \\"Come Away With Me,\\" this album is probably my favorite from Norah Jones.  It is the first representation of her range as a singer, getting somewhat away from the strictly-bluesy sound of Come Away With Me, in this album she utilizes a lighter sound, including bluegrass. I really enjoyed this album and even if you're not a dedicated listener of Ms. Jones's work (as I am), you can't go wrong with this excellent, easily enjoyable album.
B0088EDMMS|3.0|Hocus Pocus finally comes to Blu ray with a pretty ok transfer. It overall is soft, close ups have the best detail. The transfers clean up is great, no dirt or scratches that I could see. It is great improvement over the non anamorphic DVD that has been out for many years.<br /><br />Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy, and Sarah Jessica Parker as the three witches are great. The highlight of the movie.<br /><br />No extras, kind of a bummer.<br /><br />Over all I give it 3 stars for the soft, but good transfer and no extras. I think it is worth picking up if you're looking for a fun family Halloween movie.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|LOVED LOVED LOVED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! More than I thought I would. I actually bought them long before I got around reading them.<br />One more comment........ If or when a movie is made of this story, I can only see one person playing Christian Gray, that would be Ian Somerhalder....It was him I was picturing during the entire story. He has the eyes and the attitude and as far as the hair color.....keeps it like it is or color it for the part. But it should definitely be him.<br />I have asked my friend who they think should play Christian and have been given lots of different names, most didn't know of Ian or any of his previous roles, well after showing them all just one picture of him with his eyes and smoldering smile they all agreed.....THAT WAS CHRISTIAN GRAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I began these books on my travel to Europe and found them to be captivating!<br />I particularly enjoyed the 2nd book the best.  Christian Grey is quite a dark figure but one in whom you fall in love with as well as Anastasia. I finished all three while on my trip! I would like to see another follow up!
B003QS67F0|5.0|Very interesting movie- keeps you on the edge and very thought provoking! Actors are phenomenonal in this movie! Rent now if you haven't seen it!!!!!!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book drew me in and I couldn't put it down but didn't want it to be over.  This is the kind of book that will stay with you for a long time.  You fall in love with the characters and with the idea of the unexplained in a world that is so cynical.  It truly is like a grown up fairy tale that will take you back to seeing the world through the eyes of your childhood, when everything was new and wonderous and full of magic.  She is a brilliant and gifted storyteller.  I read a lot of novels and there is a difference between a writer and a person who can really tell a tale.
B008OOYALE|1.0|Then don't bother with this game. No goals, No decent updates for android users.<br />They have also recently changed pricing in game hoping you'll buy their gold for real cash in exchange for crappy updates.<br /><br />Better off finding something else to play.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|[[ASIN:B005WUHAX8 LifeProof Case for iPhone 4/4S - Retail Packaging - Pink]]  I bought this for my daughter. It is really a great case. We tested it before she used it on her phone and it was waterproof. It is also pretty solid. It is similar to otter box cases. I have an otter box for my phone, and the lifeproof seems as good. You can buy it at at & t stores, but i bought it on amazon for half the price.
B008QE9VJI|3.0|Maybe it's because I knew this remake of the old Dan Curtis TV series was \\"Tim Burton on auto-pilot\\" that I dialed my expectations down accordingly. Whatever the case may be, the 2012 \\"Dark Shadows\\" is an imperfect but -- surprisingly -- intermittently charming film that reaffirms how good an actor Johnny Depp can be.<br /><br />The star's performance as Barnabas Collins - a Maine vampire who awakens in the early `70s after having slept for over 200 years, only to find his ancestors on the downturn and his hated rival (a witch played by Eva Green) having overtaken their place in the community - absolutely anchors a sometimes chaotic and under-written (or is it over-written?) Seth Grahame-Smith screenplay that has too many supporting players running around to little or no effect. Yes, Depp's Barnabas is still \\"quirky\\" yet the actor retains enough of his aristocratic origins to make the part not just a rehash of the \\"colorful\\" characters the actor has been essaying of late; he's fascinating, alternately sinister and sympathetic, and the fish-out-of-water material, while not as dominant as the movie's advertising campaign suggested, provides some of the film's more entertaining aspects.<br /><br />The movie does fumble countless dramatic possibilities -- so much of it seems overstuffed and yet undercooked, between Barnabas' weakly drawn relationship with the younger Collins clan (Chloe Grace Moretz's part is close to a throwaway; after prominently establishing her early on, Bella Heathcote's role as the reincarnation of Barnabas' lost love disappears almost completely, resurfacing just in time for the climax), to his confrontation with Green, who turns in an unsatisfying performance (her affected American accent sounds more like she's from Texas as opposed to a witch who's lived in Maine for over two centuries). Michelle Pfeiffer, Jackie Earle Haley, and, of course, Helena Bonham Carter also appear in roles that never seem to serve the dramatic purpose that they shouldhave.<br /><br />It seems evident here that Burton didn't apply himself as much to his craft as usual -- despite using familiar personnel like production designer Rick Henrichs and costume designer Colleen Atwood, the picture has a glossy, \\"digitized\\" appearance unlike his past works -- and even Danny Elfman's score often takes a backseat to a parade of familiar, effectively utilized period pop tunes. Yet there's just something infectious about \\"Dark Shadows\\" when it does score -- particularly in several amusing moments of offbeat humor (Barnabas pounding his head against an electric organ; Alice Cooper showing up to perform at a Collins family party) and through Depp's winning performance. Though still one of Burton's weaker outings all told, it's at least livelier than the moribund \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and should find a receptive genre audience this Halloween season on video.<br /><br />Warner's Blu-Ray/DVD/Ultraviolet combo pack offers a clear 1080p transfer, with Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography utilizing a striking pallet of colors throughout. The DTS MA soundtrack is effective and extras include just five minutes of deleted scenes (mostly involving Barnabas' relationship with the modern Collins family - material that there should've been more of in the final cut) and \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\" behind-the-scenes \\"focus points.\\"
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Wanted Man did not seem to me to be a typical Jack Reacher book.  There was a great deal of writing that\\"explained\\" things, research that Lee Child or someone on his staff had done about geography and atomic waste and FBI cars and guns and on and on, filler type writing.  I primarily like conversations in action books; they move faster.  I found myself skimming over pages and pages of filler-type writing and although I live in Kansas City and am very familiar with the local of which he was writing even having a daughter who lives in Marshall, the book seemed at times a bit contrived and complicated - not the can't-put-it-down typical Jack Reacher.
B008AT71WI|5.0|Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's off-Broadway musical hit was adapted to the screen in 1986 by Ashman (who wrote the script) and director Frank Oz, whose experience with The Muppets made him the ideal candidate to bring the project's offbeat sensibilities to the big screen. Though the film wasn't a box-office smash, Oz and producer David Geffen's screen version of \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" - itself a remake of the `60s Roger Corman B-movie favorite - ranks as one of the best movie musicals.<br /><br />Rick Moranis stars as the hapless Seymour Krelborn, who works in a flower shop in Skid Row during the early `60s. In love with his co-worker Audrey (Ellen Greene, the only holdover from the stage version), who's a punching bag for her abusive dentist boyfriend (Steve Martin), Seymour's fortunes are stuck in the gutter until he discovers a new plant that feeds on human blood. Dubbed the \\"Audrey II,\\" the little plant sprouts into a full-blown talking - and singing - monster (voiced by Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops) whose aspirations seem to be larger than taking up more and more room in Mushnik's Flower Shop.<br /><br />Menken and Ashman's score is one of their best (and that's saying something): the marvelous early number \\"Downtown,\\" the ballads \\"Somewhere That's Green\\" and \\"Suddenly Seymour,\\" the showstopping \\"Mean Green Mother From Outer Space\\" (written for the film) and the Greek chorus that comments on the action with a Motown-like sound carry viewers through a wacky and wild ride that Oz peppers with occasional star cameos (Bill Murray is hilarious as one of Martin's overly eager patients; John Candy, Jim Belushi and Christopher Guest also briefly appear) and superb puppet effects.<br /><br />When \\"Little Shop\\" was first released in 1986, the movie received mostly positive reviews with an occasional recurring criticism that the film's climactic special effects overshadowed the picture's overall tone. It's ironic this complaint was levied at the movie's theatrical version - one can only imagine the criticism Oz's initial cut of the film would've been met with!<br /><br />Adding nearly 10 minutes of elaborate special effects with the Audrey IIs trashing the planet, the \\"Don't Feed the Plants\\" ending - restored here in Warner's fabulous Blu-Ray release of \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" - was wisely re-shot after test screenings confirmed that preview audiences almost unanimously hated it. Certainly it does everything some critics complained about the theatrical version and turns it up to the nth degree: shots of the plants eating their way through the streets of New York, tearing down buildings, consuming subway trains, and climbing up the Statue of Liberty are brilliantly designed and executed by Richard Conway and his model unit...but all of it comes out of left field. After watching a fairly intimate and confined musical dominated by two central characters you grow to care about (both of whom are killed off in the original ending), seeing the movie abruptly shift gears and become an FX-driven spectacle along the lines of \\"Godzilla: The Musical\\" simply doesn't work. And while Ashman had intended this ending to be tongue-in-cheek (as it plays in the stage musical), the humor is diminished on-screen because of the scale of the special effects.<br /><br />Though Oz wanted to stay true to Ashman's script and the stage version's story, the dynamics of making a film versus watching a play with live actors lead Oz to admit that he could understand why audiences disliked the original ending. As the director himself states in the Blu-Ray's new featurette, \\"in a stage play you kill the leads and they come out for a bow - in a movie, they don't come out for a bow, they're dead. And the audience loved those people.\\"<br /><br />At least viewers now have the opportunity to see Conway's special effects and Oz's original ending on Blu-Ray - even if, dramatically, it comes up short compared to the smartly reworked finale of the theatrical cut, fans ofthe movie can now see where most of the movie's budget went (buffs will also note that Paul Dooley's appearance has  been restored in the Director's Cut; his part was reshot with Jim Belushi in the revised theatrical cut ending).<br /><br />Warner's Blu-Ray edition of \\"Little Ship of Horrors,\\" which includes both versions of the film, looks as crisp as the film will ever appear: the AVC encoded transfer offers a good amount of detail and lack of DNR while the DTS MA soundtrack is satisfyingly mixed. Extra features are mostly carried over from the original DVD release of the film, the first pressing of which became one of the format's all-time most collectible titles (it offered a B&W version of the unused ending, and then was promptly pulled and repressed without it). Oz's commentary is a carry-over from that release (included on the theatrical version and the original ending of the Director's Cut), as are outtakes/deleted scenes (with Oz's optional commentary), trailers, and a 1986 promo special, \\"A Story of Little Shop of Horrors.\\" Added to this release is a nice, albeit brief, featurette with Oz and Richard Conway discussing the original ending and how thankful they are to Warner Bros. for newly restoring it for home video.<br /><br />Housed in a sleek Digibook with glossy photos, \\"Little Shop\\" fans have a reason to rejoice with a great package no matter which version of the picture they choose to view - though I'm guessing for most viewers, a single viewing of the \\"Director's Cut\\" itself will probably suffice.

The movie froze multiple times during the showing, and I would have to stop and reload amazon in order to get it going again.  Then we would have to wait as it buffered again.

0385344333|4.0|\\"He who gives a right answer kisses the lips.\\" -- Proverbs 24:26 (NKJV)<br /><br />A Wanted Man is a different kind of story about Jack Reacher. Don't expect the same old, same old.<br /><br />There's always been an element of Sherlock Holmes' style sleuthing in the Reacher series. As an ex-MP, Reacher can spot anomalies a mile off and make sense of them. Such observations are typically concentrated in just the beginning and end of the books. In this one, it's the major plot device. Consequently, the plot has to be adjusted to permit Reacher to do his thinking thing. I liked it. You may not.<br /><br />The other big difference is that the danger and menace are much less in this book than in the rest of the series. I missed these elements.<br /><br />I did find myself eager for some more action, and there was a decent amount before the book ended. Will it be enough for those who love the Reacher stories about taking on a whole town? Probably not.<br /><br />The title also seemed to me to be a little off. Reacher is always a wanted man by someone in these novels. You could have called this book, \\"Reacher Buys New Clothes,\\" and the title would have been equally descriptive in terms of describing what the story is about.<br /><br />I hope this style won't become the new standard. I think it's okay once in awhile though.
0345803485|5.0|Although a little bit too indicent, I LOVED IT!!<br />Will and have recommended these books to others!<br />I'm currently reading through for the second time:)
0547995660|4.0|Someone gave me this book after I told them how much I loved 'The Hunger Games.' It was an interesting read. It had hints of 'Brave New World,' and this not so perfect, 'perfect' community. It was definitely better than 'The Uglies,' which is also a YA sort of dark, future society. Out of this genre I would have to say that 'Hunger Games' and 'Logans Run' are my favorite, but 'The Giver' gave an interesting take on it, even if it was a little depressing. I would say this is probably a better message for kids to read than THG, though, not quite as much fun.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Sexy and has a wonderful story line. Couldn't put the book down and finished it in 1 day. I hope she writes more than 3!
B000002AVF|5.0|It took me listening to this CD 3 times to like it. That is usually how it is for me to like a particular album.  The 3rd time was the charm. I was actually paying attention to the songs. It is pretty amazing. She is super talented. Its hard to find an album nowadays that u like 90% of the songs on. \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\" and \\" E=MC2\\" was not put up to the standards of her earlier albums which is a shame but I am still a fan of Ms. Carey for the work she did back in the days.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It was a birthday present for my 14-year old. He got the set of books for Christmas and wanted all the movies. We are very happy with this set!  It's very compact.
B0007YVBFC|3.0|It is not good considering the fact that it is Mariah Carey;'s CD. People went crazy over this CED. It sounds like any other artists' album nowadays. I just had really high expectation.
B007T99ENE|5.0|Sweet Tooth is Ian McEwan's latest novel and, following the disappointment of \\"Solar\\" marks a return to form. The story of a young woman, who is embarking upon a career in MI5, has the pace of a spy thriller, and is somewhat lighter in touch than many of McEwen's previous novels.  It is written from the point of view of the main protagonist, explores the difficult double life that she is required to lead, but never gets bogged down in overly-long psychological analysis of the complex relationships she is exposed to.  Set in the 1970s the descriptions are accurate and integral to the totality of the work, but never detract from the dynamics of the plot, which is clever and well executed.  It is a pleasure to read the work of an author who is so utterly in command of the English language, and who appears to have a bottomless reservoir of stories waiting to be beautifully told.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great game could not put it down! like to see a second part to this game! hopefully as good or better.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This is a great game and it is about time Playrix got into games for the Kindle Fire.<br />Took a while to load but plays fine.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo4PQN0TMHIJOX]] I fear the plastic \\"prongs\\" could potentially be a weak point in the future,so  I'm giving it 4 1/2 stars. I also have the $44.99 Marware cover for the original Kindle Fire, which is a better quality cover and still in great shape. I do think that this is a nice sturdy cover though, and actually, I'm so impressed with my other Marware cover that I really don't anticipate any issues with this one- but since the potential for breakage is there with the plastic, I'll rate it lower than the other cover to show room for improvement.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is a gripping story told in the true voice of the SEAL who wrote it.  (I saw and heard him in an interview.)  This book is not a glory story.  It is a startlingly complete revelation of a typical life in special operations.  The reader learns how these extraordinarily intelligent and well-trained men dedicate their personal and professional lives to our country.  The author looks the reader in the eye and does not blink.<br /><br />The culmination of this book is the killing of Bin Laden.  However, as the author notes, this is the exact type of exercise they either train for or execute in the field every day of their professional lives.<br /><br />This book is the real deal.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|I am a big fan of Ken Follett.  Pillars of the Earth and World Without End got me hooked.  Fall of the Giants was one of my favorite books of historical fiction in the last 5 years.  I have been waiting for this book for almost 2 years.  BUT I AM DISAPPOINTED><br />1) Overpriced for Kindle.  I know the publisher sets the price, but still.  Overpriced for print as well.  But I would not care so much if it was a better book.<br />2) Poorly written.  Follett leans on romance and sex scenes repeatedly in a far more prurient manner than in his previous books.  His sexual descriptions are more detailed, almost to the point of vulgarity.  THIS IS NOT WHAT HE IS CAPABLE OF.  Character development pretty much always includes sexual descriptions.<br />3) History moves way, way, way to the background.  There is so much rich material available to deal with in WWII, yet Follett manages, even in a long book, to skim over virtually every important event.  This is drama, mostly romantic drama with rivalries.  Stereotypes abound.<br />Summary:  When I write reviews, which is rare, I do not summarize plot/characters/etc.  I let others write those types of reviews and I appreciate them.  I only try and advise other buyers as to if, based on typical reader expectations, they will be satisfied or delighted.  In this case, I doubt many will be nearly as delighted with this as they were with Fall of the Giants.<br /><br />Yes I am finishing it.  It is not as bad as some have reviewed, it just does not come close to the last 3 works.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|On the Reacher Creature scale, 1 being \\"I've read at least 2 Reacher novels\\" and 2 is \\"I've read everything plus the short stories and I see Lee Child at 3 or more book signings a year so I can update my daily blog on all things Reacher,\\" I'm probably an 8 or 8 1/2. I have read everything, and I do enjoy the Reacher character immensely. That being said, this installment was phoned in. Low on action, high on Reacher spouting off geographical statistics, whatever assets this story has are undermined by a predictable and occasionally cliche story. It seems as though Mr. Child just needed to get something out to fill his annual quota of Reacher while he works on the \\"real\\" story we're all waiting for. You can skip this one. All you really need to know is that Reacher is still trying to get to Virginia, but his hardships continue in the Great Plains/MidWestern states and he hasn't gotten there yet.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Wow, wow, wow. I purchased this book for Kindle after seeing the movie.  The actors portrayed the characters brilliantly so I didn't think it would be possible to enjoy this book more than the film as I usually do.  Boy was I wrong. The books is written as a series of letters from Eva to Franklin chronicling their lives together and their relationship with their children.  At first, I thought I would be annoyed with this format as the prose was really flowery and pretentious, meant to put a voice to Eva and her character.  Within a few chapters, it didn't bother me but it did really add to the depth of her character and allowed me to step into her mind and understand her personality.  I was surprised how much my view of her especially changed through the course of the book.  The way she described her daily interactions with her son really made me question whether he could be born evil or just reacting to the obvious disdain his mother seems to have for him?  We learn a lot from the ending when allowed to hear conversations between mother and son. The author tackled a really ambitious topic.  How do you write a fictional novel about a heinous epidemic that no one wants to talk about but everyone will want to read?  She achieved her goal with perfection.  This one will stick with me for sure.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Pines is a wonderful pastiche of genre fiction that has \\"snap, crackle and pop\\" to spare. Never boring, never dull, this brutal, high velocity tale transports the reader to Norman Rockwellian Wandering Pines, where all hell breaks loose.(Hell is other people as Sartre used to say.)<br /><br />If we were in the middle of Summer I'd recommend Crouch's darkly dystopic tale as a perfect beach read. Since Halloween is fast approaching, however,I'll try to scare up some readers by recommending Pines as a great Halloween read.<br /><br />Regardless of the season, Pines is bone crunching, escapist fun.
B0080SE0UA|4.0|This one is pretty strong. A return to form. I dug 'em back in the day but lost touch  with them for a good 20 yrs. Bit I DL'd this album and it's a rocker. Not as good as Love or Electric but I'd put it right there with Sonic Temple, maybe a little behind.
0307990419|5.0|This audio book is 20 hours long. It is a great story that will keep you captivated, but it starts out a bit slow. There are 15 CD's. By CD #8, I was completely hooked on the story. It is read by two actors who do a fabulous job as the two main characters. I would drive around longer just to listen to what happened next in this mesmerizing story.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Only Reacher can make a car ride entertaining. What makes Jack Reacher a great hero is his personal integrity. In this story he is once again hitchiking and takes a ride with what appears to be a business team. Nothing could be further than the truth and how he sees through their act and sorts out the good from the bad is what keeps us reading. Wish I were that good at \\"reading\\" people. Enough twists to surprise you but still keep the story believable. Reacher fans will not be disappointed here.

You'd be missing out on a fantastic album if you didn't purchase this.  I would highly recommend the deluxe version.  The lyrics and melodies are all so beautiful.
1450400957|5.0|I purchased this for my husband and he loves it!  He uses it everytime he works out.  He loves the diagrams to see what he is working with each exercise. I also have used the womens workouts and the book is very user friendly.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|All the PR worked and i bought this book out of sheer curiosity. The writing is simple and you tend to empathize easily with the main character as she embarks on a journey of self discover and passion. Read a bit and you do start rooting for her in some time. Expect lots of sex and a bit of rampant debauchery.<br /><br />It's a good book and you should probably try giving it a chance. A good amount of mystery and anticipation created by the author should probably keep you interested till the end of the book. And again - out of curiosity you are going to end up buying the next one too.

B004K4IZ3G|5.0|I watched the original Tron when I was a kid.<br /><br />The sequel is actually following its tradition with a twist.<br /><br />Really recommended for it's fx, something that hasn't seen before not even in the original Tron (because its really old, but innovative in its time)<br /><br />The plot could of been more complex, but is entertaining.<br /><br />Any Tron fans out there, I think you won't be dissapointed.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|As of this writing, 1,046 people have reviewed this product, and most of it was positive. To me, that says you can't view this product and not feel strongly about it--strongly on the 3-5 star range, and it makes sense.<br /><br />There are those of us who go to movies or buy DVDs to be totally passive and entertained. Christopher Nolan's \\"Inception\\" is not one of those films. You need to pay attention. In fact, it was too demanding for one viewing, and that's okay. Sometimes I enjoy watching a film multiple times. The multiple viewings, in this case, were fine since so much of the film is just amazing to watch. The visual effects were nothing short of inspired.<br /><br />On the other hand, I hate feeling like I have to take notes while I watch a movie. Even if I have to really pay attention, it better be worth it, plotwise. (\\"Memento\\" is one of those films; so is \\"Pulp Fiction\\"). This one... myeh, maybe... okay, it is. There is a great deal of hesitancy (as you can tell) on my part to give this five stars. I think four is fair enough, and worth the $1.99 rental.
B001FB55I0|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, as a Terminator fan I was wating long for the aftermath of the judgement day event..<br /><br />The movie doesn't actually follows the same timeline as the original date, there's no laser guns and no T-800 walking around in packs.<br /><br />Nice performance from Chistian Bale and Sam Worthington, great fx and sound.<br /><br />The director's cut edition really leaves you kind of dissapointed as there's no valuable new material...

0385344333|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book.  Like a great many other reviewers, I thought that this book didn't do the Reacher series justice.<br /><br />The story is not all that compelling, there's nothing new here, and I got tired of reading pages of boring landscape descriptions.<br /><br />It was also hard to get drawn into the story because the story nemesis was never really developed making it hard for me to really care about the outcome.<br /><br />If you haven't read all of the Reacher books this definitely is not the one to read.  The others are all really good.<br /><br />A Wanted Man isn't a really bad book - it just doesn't compare well with the past books in the series.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Really easy reading and am now a Bit hooked.<br />Liked the characters, good flow I am now on the third book😊
B00846REIS|5.0|I Love love love it.  I had read the 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy and felt so empty wanting more.  I did some research and wanted to know what would be a good book to follow up with this when I came across reviews for Bared to You.  Well SO far I have read this book 3 times and find myself watching the calendar for October 2, 2012 so I can read the next in the series.  I think I actually like this better than 50 Shades mostly because it didn't take so long to build up to good parts.  Also it was nice to see the main female character not being this perfect little innocent virgin who becomes corrupt with carnal desire.  Eva was a real woman with a real past like majority of us women do.  Sylvia Day's writing style showed that she was a seasoned veteran in this genre of books and not someone who was repeating the same acts ofdesire over and over.  With out a doubt I would and do tell everyone of my friends that they need to read this book and get on board to watch the world blast off with the Crossfire Novel phenomon... 50 Shades who....I choose Gideon and Eva.
B00756GKBA|5.0|Like a good wine,\\"Madonna\\", just gets better with time. If you are a true Madonna fan you will love this album. If you are not a fan you will probably compare it to whoever your favorite artist is and not like it. I love this album for what it is, and it is AWESOME! I can listen to every track and enjoy every single one! It is her 12th studio album and debuted at # 1 in 37 countries around the world so I am not the only one who loves it. She has done it again!
B008MC175A|4.0|This is a bundle of five X-Men movies.  Please note that this is not a box set, it is just the five movies sold together - each movie comes in its own separate blu-ray case. Video/audio quality varies by disc, but is generally excellent; these discs also include a variety of special features that take you behind the scenes of the making of the movies.<br /><br />The X-Men movies hold and important place in film history; the first film in the series is often credited as the film that launched the golden age of comic book superheroes on film.  Both the original X-Men and it's sequel, X2: X-Men United, are well regarded among audiences.  The final film in the trilogy, X-Men: The Last Stand, is not nearly as good as its predecessors - but it's still a fun movie with great action sequences.<br /><br />Also included in the bundle is the spin-off titled X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which looks at the early days of Logan (perhaps the most popular character in the franchise).  And finally, X-Men: First Class is a prequel which examines the history between Professor Charles Xavier and his friend (turned adversary) Magneto.<br /><br />My own opinion is that the X-Men films are not quite on the level of Nolan's Batman trilogy or Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy.  However, these movies are very entertaining, and there are interesting themes related to society's acceptance/rejection of the mutants that parallel our own problems.  In terms of technical achievement, I would single out the costume design and the makeup work as top-notch.<br /><br />If you've never seen the X-Men films, or if you're a fan but have yet to buy them, then this Complete Collection on blu-ray is the perfect set for you and comes highly recommended.<br /><br />Here are the links to the individual releases:<br />[[ASIN:B001PPGAJE X-Men [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B001PPGAJY X2: X-Men United [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B000KC86F4 X-Men - The Last Stand [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B001GCUO16 X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Two-Disc Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B004LWZW4C X-Men: First Class (+ Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />(Amazon's prices constantly change, and in some cases it may actually be cheaper to buy the titles individually)Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B004LWZW4C X-Men: First Class (+ Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />(Amazon's prices constantly change, and in some cases it may actually be cheaper to buy the titles individually)
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Awesome ...a must see.  I never wanted it to end and immediately googled Avenger's 2.  This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat!  Great storyline and well written.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read all the previous Jack Reacher novels and thoroughly enjoyed every one.  However, this new book, while quite good, does not approach the quality and entertainment of previous books.  Definitely worth reading, just not up to the level of writing I've previously enjoyed.  Looking forward to the next one!
B000FC1192|5.0|Neil Gaiman's \\"Coraline\\" is a very dark fairy tale.  It's very well-written and, for a fairy tale, well-described (though, for all intents and purposes, everything takes place in one locale).  I'm rating it at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5.  However, I was torn about the rating.  Since the book is a fairy tale (and Gaiman, in his afterword, specifically says he wrote it for his 6-year old child), I initially considered it to be far too dark for its audience.  But, after thinking about those original fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm (which are darn nasty), I changed my mind.  Gaiman's forte is myth and fairy tales and this book falls right in that domain.  It might somewhat offend our sensibilities about what young children should read.  But, still, Good triumphs, Evil is overcome, and everyone lives happily ever after.  It's worth a bit of a scare.
B00866JL96|5.0|After reading the Kindle edition of this story, I knew I had to see the movie.  While the beginning of the movie differs from the beginning of the book greatly, it still gave a wonderful tail of destiny, love, jealousy, family, and committment.  I loved reading so much, I was dissapointed when it was over even though I already knew the ending.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I already paid for the office suite now they want to charge me for fonts that they don't even own?! This is disgusting!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Another strong season from Kurt Sutter and the crew of Sons of Anarchy!  Hopefully they can keep the success going for at least a few more seasons since they've signed up through six or seven now.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|Generally I dislike duet CD's and DVD's as they are not done live. Apparently the singers are at two different locations and joined together electronically and usually mismatched. This DVD is done live with great interaction between Tony and the other great performers with fabulous background music. This is a fantastic DVD and a joy to watch over and over. Tony is 85 and can still sing and looks great. He sings many of my favorite songs of all times.
B00866JL96|5.0|This is a great movie. Definitely worth the money. Also arrives right at your door for under $20 great buy

B003TSEEDY|4.0|Love the format of the novel as the way of telling the story. Letters to a stranger convey a \\"dear diary\\" mood but also echoes the real-world isolation of the author on every page.
055357342X|3.0|I'll preface by saying I only just finished this book and haven't read the rest of the series (or what there is of it so far).<br /><br />Also - Spoilers.  I'll try not to be too specific about it, though.<br /><br />The major complaint seems to be that all the good characters die.  *Several* \\"good\\" characters get the ax, but by no means all or even most of them (depending on who you count under the umbrella of good characters, maybe not even a majority of them).  Conversely, a number of \\"bad\\" characters also get snuffed out, and it seems to me that their deaths will have much greater impact in the future of the series.  What's more significant about the numerous notable character deaths is what it means for the future - with so many prominent people dead, it seems like things in Westeros will necessarily be very, very different from the way they were in the first three novels.  I expect to see major shifts in power, and some formerly small or behind-the-scenes houses rising to prominence.  While this wasn't done in a way that I would have liked (I think he chose kind of a lame way to end the Lannister-Stark war), I do think that all-in-all it was a good move to keep things fresh.<br /><br />I can sympathize to a degree with the sentiment that there's not much worth reading, as at this point in the story the Starks who are many people's favorite group of characters are dwindling into less and less important players in the game.  I enjoy reading about the world and the remaining characters enough to at least give the next book in the series a shot, though.<br /><br />My complaints with the books have more to do with Martin's writing.  I think Martin is a better story teller than he is a writer.  Martin can be painfully repetitive when it comes to already-well-established character details, and I wanted to claw my eyes out after reading that Davos reached for his pouch but it was gone, or that Sandor Clegane hates knights, for the 10th time.  You don't need to tell the reader what they already know, and you *really* don't need to do it 3 times per chapter involving said character.  Character introductions are also redundant, but towards the beginning of the novel he tells the reader who each major character is, as if they hadn't just read 1200 pages in the form of the two preceding novels about these very characters.  Conversely there are so many minor characters that show up pretty infrequently and yet the reader has to fend for himself when identifying them.<br /><br />Martin also seems over-fond of ending chapters on a cliffhanger which is all fine and good from time to time, but doesn't need to happen every. single. chapter.  Additionally, given the format of the books as a series of point-of-view chapters, you're likely to have read through several other characters' perspectives and events before returning to the character whose chapter ended in a cliffhanger, meaning you may well not remember what the cliffhanger was, and it typically turns out to have beeen something mostly insignificant anyways.<br /><br />Between the obsessive attention to well-established detail, redundant character introductions, and the silly cliffhangers his writing can feel very amateurish.<br /><br />In praise, I'll say that the world itself is a lot of fun to read about and immerse yourself in.  His attention to detail gives the reader a very vivid image of the events (which is funny, because for me it's often at odds with the show).<br /><br />I also like that in this book, at least *some* characters begin to feel a little less black-and-white.  Jaime Lannister, Arya Stark, and Sansa Stark all become much more interesting then they had been, and we get a harsh reminder that not *all* of the Starks followers are the honorable and noble Northmen or Riverlanders that they're held up to be.<br /><br />All in all the books are a decent read and I intend to continue with the series, but Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings are both better than Storm ofSwords in my opinion.  We'll see what Feast of Crows brings.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Movie is fast paced, thrilling and just totally awesome. I was at the edge of my seat the whole time. The actors, the story, the music was a blend of both Star Trek classic and the fast pace of Star wars. Great movie and enjoyed it.

Over all good game, and works great on Kindle Fire.

B0018ARMW0|5.0|As I write this review a whopping 151 so-called Dream Theater fans gave Train of Thought one star reviews. Excuse me for saying this, but with fans like this who needs enemies! I gave a one star review once. It was I'm in a Metal Mood by Pat Boone and it was truly dreadful. Train of Thought is far from being Dreadful. Have you guys listened to In the Name of God and Honor Thy Father? Those two long superb songs are worth four stars alone and truthfully Black Sabbath sounding As I Am. and Stream of Consciousness aren't far behind. Go on listen to them again and tell me those songs are dreadful! I dare you. I double Dare you.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Ok this movie is soo well put together its crazy. Everytime i watch it i get goosebumps they made it soo good it feels like your in the movie when the avengers are fighting it makes you feel as if you were one of the avengers. This movie just makes you feel soo awesome honestly i can watch this movie over and over and specially if you play this movie threw a good pair of headphones (Beats by Dre) or whoever or if its played threw a home entertainment center it makes you sink into your seat and concentrate on every little bit of this movie. You notice everything in this movie from the little things to the huge things. This movie has great comedy superb action. Whoever hasnt seen this movie it is a must. All those people who dont like it its there opinion you shouldnt go by review of a movie yes my review is saying to see it but im serious ive seen alot of movies before that ive loved and this broke the scale when i saw it May 9 i was soo excited.<br /><br />On a scale from 1-10 this movie gets 100 breaks the scales Perfectly done cant wait for the sequel... :)
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This one did exactly what I had hoped it would do.  It let me know that there are many more steps in a do-it-yourself  approach to publishing on Kindle than I care to work with.  I had rather pay someone to do that work while I write the next book.  If I were going to pursue doing it myself, though, these instructions seem to be clearly written and are in the logical order.  I believe I could, I just don't want to think that hard about it.
B00786XVOG|5.0|Another way to relax. Peaceful music,El Morro Puerto Rico so beautiful.The man sure knowa how to put on a concert.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|After so many sweet-spot novels, it must get tougher and tougher to keep a steady aim, and A Wanted Man is starting to reveal Lee Child's wonderful formula. The revelation just slightly blurs Reacher's heretofore vivid outlines. Oh, yes, still terrific. But not quite up to this reader's (probably unfair) ever-rising expectations.
B008CP93S0|1.0|I hate to even give this one star.<br /><br />This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.. Tried to watch, but had to stop after 15 minutes. Thought Paul Rudd, Jennifer Aniston I like them both, need some light laughs. Boy was I wrong. Crude, stupid \\"humor\\". Paul & Jennifer should be ashamed to be part of this horrible piece of trash.<br /><br />If you truly want to waste your money and your time watch this movie. You will be sorry you did. Absolute garbage.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quiet and soothing music, combined with soft and sensual grAphics to create a unique game. The puzzles are challenging but fair.  Delightful.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee child as only lee child can do it.  Read every single jack reacher's adventures. Love this character.  Jack Reacher is the epitome of a free spirit.  Only hope that Mr Child will  write another real soon, as I feel withdrawal symptoms coming on.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Very enjoyable read, although I may have an uncontrollable desire to spend my day watching 1980's sitcoms and movies now.<br /><br />I read this book not too long after I read Daemon, and there are a lot of similarities between the two books. A genius software designer, a virtual world, an evil determined to control that world... but both books stand alone in their own right. The main characters in Ready Player One were well written and sympathetic. The relationships they built were interesting. I enjoyed the online-only aspect of their lives and how that changed how they interacted with each other.<br /><br />There were a few scenes that felt unnecessarily long, and others that could have been longer. But overall, very enjoyable.<br /><br />(review edited for a misspelling)
B007RI56NY|4.0|Very enjoyable album. Although is not my favorite music is different from what I usually hear. I like the lyrics and easy style.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|When I first learned Michael Keaton was going to portray Batman in 1989, I thought it was going to adapt this novel.  No so.  Many of the Batman movies have lifted elements of the the original Frank Miller graphic novel.  It doesn't disappoint me as a fan.  In fact, the movie condensed what could have been very long scenes of internal dialogue.  It moves along at a quick pace and is faithful to the source material.  I can't wait for part II.  Peter Weller portrays a 55 year old Batman very accurately.  This Batman doesn't have the physical agility he used to. He has a harder time keeping up, because of his years fighting crime.  It's these scenes that humanized the character and made him realistic.  It's why I loved the graphic novel in the first place.  It deals with aging and coping with change.  Something super hero comics never seem to do.<br /><br />The battle with the mutant gang leader was better than the comic. The ferocity and brutality of the of the fight isn't watered down. This movie is as good as it gets with Batman.  I can't wait for the conclusion!
B0083EW97W|5.0|I really enjoy this album. Music is easy and slow and relates to life experiences.. Feels more like 60's folk music. REcommend to hear while walking in the park.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Wow, what A Great, Great, Movie.  I loved everything about Thor, the movie was excellent from beginning to end.  The writing alone pulls you in and makes you care.  Despite being set on multiple planets, all planets involved, thanks to amazing special effects, brilliant acting, and clever writing, are incredibly believable and real.  The movie has humor, scares, bonus characters, tie ins with other movies, and an overall compelling story line.  Chris Hemsworth is excellent as Thor, Natalie Portman delivers a great performance as well, and Kenneth Branagh does an amazing job directing the film.  This movie is worth your time and money, and is definitely a film to watch over, and over again.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game!! lots of things to unlock. takes a while to get more coins but other than that its very entertaining! !
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like it where the numbers are big enough to see.  It's like having your own calulater with you at all times.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|Typical action movie with some nice CG. Characters could have been fleshed out more. Sentemental ending. Movie should have provided deeper story line as to why the aliens attacked Earth.
B00684J49U|5.0|I made a pre-order of the product and it arrived on the day it promised. Excellent condition with proper seal. I have been waiting for the DVD for months and I finally got it!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I really love Pinterest, and like most users I'm a bit of an addict.  I really love this app for Kindle.  It's very simple to use and efficient.  However it doesn't always work properly.  sometimes I open it and it will take a long time to load and then will just say something along the lines of \\"sorry, pinterest is not working right now\\" so I just \\"force close\\" and go back to my carasel and open it again and it usually works.  It is also a bit slow sometimes but overall I've been pleased with it and have been able to use it almost as well as I use it on my lap top.  Worth the FREE purchase :)
B004OC07N0|4.0|Concise, engaging and practical.  This is for leaders to apply on many levels.  I usually find leadership books avisory without concrete obviously applicable guidance. The First 90 Days is the exception.  I will recommend this book to colleagues and subordinate leaders.
B008NW67E0|5.0|i really cant fault them as many others have already done (though the album was only officially released today) for \\"more of the same.\\" what we have here is another welcome collection of brilliant, epic, charmingly english folk-rock tunes from a fantastic band with a fantastic sound that everyone likes and deep down they all know it. in today's sonic landscape there's only one mumford & sons, and i'll happily take as many albums of this caliber as they can deliver, consarn it. it's still very new to me, and i haven't had the time to let it seep in entirely, but it doesn't take long to be won over by a record from a band with a sound this heart-wrenchingly, fist-pumpingly engaging. it's lush, dynamic, inspiring, catchy, and huge--often with a vast, towering grandiosity and bombast that for just about any other band would come across as overblown self-indulgent melodrama, but when these guys belt it out it, it just absolutely hits the spot. it's exactly the very subtle progression i had hoped for with this record--the only-slight tweaking of the band's already-perfected texture and dynamics, not straying far from the familiar, satisfying sound that scratches your mumford itch. soft and sweet in just the right spots; relentless, pounding and incendiary in the rest. it's largely predictable, yes--but when the thing you're predicting makes you bob your head, stomp your feet and grin uncontrollably...well more-of-the-same'll do just fine.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|They've been my favorite band since 1995, and after hearing excerpts of their new material, including the full version of Kill The DJ, I was preparing to be disappointed by this album. All I can say is that I'm thoroughly surprised. This is a new sound from Green Day. If you're expecting Dookie, Insomniac, American Idiot-- you might be disappointed. This is some great rock n' roll music, different than anything they've ever done. The vocals are excellent, Billie does several \\"cock-rock\\" style solos in the album, the drums are thumping, the bass sounds great-- it's just a fresh sound that I think will appeal to many and grow to you after a few listens. Now hearing the entire album, Kill the DJ and Oh Love aren't so bad. Don't get caught up in jusging this album based on what you've already heard, nor what others are saying. Give it a listen if you like rock music and aren't afraid to hear the band do something a little different than their past albums.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|\\"The Affair\\" was a real disappointment.  \\"A Wanted Man\\" delivers at least a reasonable facsimile of Jack during the first half of the book.  The problem with this book is not Reacher, it's the plot.  I had the three people in the car pegged within the firsts 20 pages of meeting them, and what the heck was that ridiculous business with the eyelids?<br /><br />The second half of the story is so predictable that I finally realized it's sort of an accumulation of various storylines from various Tom Cruise movies.  Lee Child, what were you thinking, letting them cast Tiny Tom as Jack Reacher?  Jack doesn't own a fast car, he doesn't have a job, and he definitely would not recognize himself in the upcoming movie if he sat and watched it.  I'm not sure he would recognize himself in this book either.<br /><br />Mr. Child, if you can't write any more true Jack Reacher novels, then please stop . . . .I would rather remember Jack the way he was than have him turn into whatever it is he is turning into.  By contrast, your recent Jack Reacher stories have been great!  maybe you should stick with those?
B008OTTRXU|4.0|Sorry to say but I am 31 and am guilty and a sucker for Pure Pop Music. Everyone will always have an opinion but didn't Madonna and Kylie Minogue have the same kind of musical arrangements, synths and bass lines as well in the 80's and early 90's? The answer is yes and they are now famous....This album will definitely have me pumped in the morning when I get up for work or getting ready to go to a club on the weekends. The highlights of this album are Turn Me On, Tiny Little Bows and Hurt So Good. \\"Turn Me Up\\" reminds me of Madonna's \\"Holiday\\" and Kylie's \\"Love At First Sight\\" and \\"Hurts So Good\\" has a Belinda Carlisle meets Steve Winwood melody 80's/TRL feel to it. It's about time there is something out there that isn't too Club banging, Overly Sexual or Depressing....Great Work Carly!!!!!
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I´m totally blown away by this show. What a cast and what a storyline. The Brothers Grimm themselves would bow in front of this piece of magic.<br />Since LOST I wasn´t so overwhelmed by a TV series. I must admit after watching the first 15 minutes of episode 1 I was quite disappointed and rated<br />the show as kids stuff. Boy, I was so wrong! After picking up where I left more than 2 months ago I watched the first episode to the end and now I<br />can hardly wait for the next one.  The intrigues and the stories are the best since...well, LOST. Don´t pay attention to all ratings below 5 stars!<br />They are nonsense! Don´t miss one of the greatest shows in the 21st century and may \\"Once upon a time\\" tell it´s tales for a long, long time.....
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a very ingeniuos and entertaining game and very challenging. I really enjoy it. No crashes so far.  Love it!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I should probably start by admitting that I'd already read and totally loved the original Swedish version.  But that only makes me more critical of the translation, which I'm very happy to say I loved.  Bradbury really captured the spirit and style of the original writing.  (I am puzzled, however, as to why the publisher chose to use the Swedish \\"dialog dash\\" instead of English quotation marks for the dialog.  In both the British and US versions.  Strange!)<br /><br />The story is wonderful, incredibly funny, very quirky and quite original. What else can you say about a centenarian on the run from his own 100th birthday party, teaming up with a 70-year-old petty thief, the world's most educated hot-dog stand owner, a female recluse and her pet elephant?  (Best line in the book: \\"Sonia, sit!\\" -- I won't say any more than that; you simply must read it!)  And interspersed with hilarious tales of the man's Forrest Gump-like life, in which he, through absolutely no design of his own, managed to have a finger in every major event of historical significance since his birth in 1905.<br /><br />This book immediately made it onto my top-ten-favorite-books-ever list, and I hope it will make yours, too!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This isn't my usual reading material, but I got sucked into it after finishing NO EASY DAY, and wanting to read more about our country's elite warriors. I loved this book. It was incredibly inspiring and deeply moving. Very highly recommended.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I have never read a book that I wanted more to see it as a movie. The book kept you guessing right up until the end, and what a great ending it was. I finished this book in three days as it totally captivated my attention. I've become a new fan of Mr. Crouch's writing.
B008RYN44U|5.0|I love that this album has the old school elements from the Beacon Street collection. The ska feel is back in the music and I am thrilled. I think you have to be a fan of ND before Tragic Kingdom to really appreciate this record.
030758836X|5.0|Absolutely brilliant, terrifying, twisted and genius. Who is this Gillian Flynn? And most importantly who is Amy Dunn? Wow. The experience I had reading this book was unreal and I'd happily give my left arm for a sequel. Best book of 2012, hands down.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie looks great in 3D. I would recommend if you have purchased a 3D Blu-Ray player and never find yourself taking advantage of the technology that you paid for (or fell for), this is the movie to do the job.
B001O03NCW|5.0|The movie was good, the sound track is great. One quick delete of \\"Po Lazarus\\" and you will be good to go.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I got this as a faotd and instantly became hooked. it is a great time waster. totally fun.cant wait for more levels.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This book is an awesome work of an excellent writer. Jack reacher is the main character and he pulls no punches in this thriller.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I was surprised at how easy and interesting this book is written.  I reads like a good action adventure novel as you can't wait to turn the page to read what happens next.  It is an eye opener as to the training of the Seals and interesting on how when and where these men are deployed.  It's a real and interesting story and adventure for sucess of the Seal's missions.  A really good read.
030758836X|4.0|First off: it's hard to write anything lengthy about this book without giving away crucial points, so this is going to be a brief. But I am going to include some info people may consider \\"spoilers,\\" so watch out.<br /><br />I got totally sucked into this book and finished over the course of one plane trip (actually getting snapped at by one flight attendant when I wouldn't put my Kindle away fast enough prior to landing!). You hear books and movies described as \\"roller coaster rides,\\" but this book really is one. It whiplashes you. One minute you think one thing, the next minute you think something else. Then, you don't know what to think. Then you realize that you've been an idiot, and that things are so much more complex than they seem - about the same time the characters in the book realize the same thing.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed reading this book. It is a masterwork. I am not sure how it was possible for Gillian Flynn to craft a story like this and not telegraph plot points, or the ending, which seems to happen so often (where you can say, by page 20, \\"the butler did it\\" or whatever). I have read a lot of mysteries, and a lot of thrillers, but this book honestly kept me guessing the whole way through. I had no idea how it was going to end, which was good. But then the ending came, and that was bad. All I will say is: I think we all have a need, in our reading experiences, to feel like there is some degree of balance or justice that gets meted out to the deserving. Yes, I know that does not happen in real life. Yes, I know the book is better for not having a predictable, good-triumphs-over-evil ending. That all does not make me like the ending any better. Actually, the final scene profoundly disturbed me, because...well, I can't say why without REALLY putting out spoilers. So what I'll say is, I am not sure I would have read the book if I had known how it ended, in advance. But I am glad I did read the book because man, oh man. I have not had a reading experience that riveting or nail-biting in a long time.<br /><br />Like a lot of folks, I look at reviews before I decide to buy books. In this case, I am glad I didn't read the reviews before getting this, because I would have missed out on reading something I really enjoyed. This is one of those rare cases where an ending I found unsatisfying didn't ruin the rest of the book for me. If you're reading these reviews, and you haven't read the book, STOP, read the book, then come back and read the reviews. The reading experience is worth it, even if the ending or other points of the narrative are less-than-satisfying for you.
B005RUV0NY|4.0|Its amazing how little network TV I watch these days.  This show and many others on Cable TV are the only ones worth watching anymore.  Out of all the post apocalyptic shows that seem to be popping up lately, The Walking Dead, is by far the most bone chilling.  The gruesome nature of this show though is not for the faint of heart.  I find myself turning away from the TV from time to time because of how nasty some of the scenes are.  This show keeps you immersed for nearly the whole time you watch.  Can't wait to see if the character's luck will turn around at all in the the 3rd season!
B008RYN44U|5.0|Since [[ASIN:B000001Y79 \\"Tragic Kingdom\\"]], legions of \\"I was here first\\" fans have lamented how No Doubt doesn't sound like [[ASIN:B000001Y5B \\"No Doubt\\"]] anymore. The complaints aren't any fresher in 2012 than they were in 1995.<br /><br />The very crux here, is that No Doubt is a radio-friendly band, and they mostly do radio-friendly songs. If you're able to see past the weird pretension that all but two studio albums were mainstream successes (or that the eponymous \\"No Doubt\\" and [[ASIN:B000001Y4W \\"Beacon Street Collection\\"]] were often in the bargain bin, when stores had bargain bins), \\"Push and Shove\\" is a logical progression for the band.<br /><br />Longtime fans will almost certainly find and appreciate the writing influence from Tony Kanal and Tom Dumont here -- just as they could see where it was largely (Kanal) or entirely (Dumont) absent on Gwen Stefani's solo efforts. Worrying that this is [[ASIN:B00064AEJW \\"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\\"]] or [[ASIN:B000JJRIN4 \\"The Sweet Escape\\"]] rehashed is missing the point entirely.<br /><br />Of course, longtime fans will also be nearing their 30's and beyond, which presents something of a conundrum. You have to wonder if incorporating lukewarm dubstep beats and other recent trends is No Doubt's way of adapting to what's current, or if they're really serving up the trends in a way that their aging fan base will enjoy. Either way, that question ultimately matters to one's own snobbery, and doesn't change the fact that \\"Push and Shove\\" is a brilliant addition to any No Doubt fan's collection.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I thought I would like to read, but the preview chapters are not very exciting and the price is way too high! This is a review of the worth of the product as a whole and in my opinion the value is not there in writing or price.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|good game, would recommend to anyone who loves puzzles! worth the cost. it is great fun for all ages. please get this game for yourself.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book....I couldn't put it down!  It was very interesting to see what the life of these brave men is like.

B008CPZNL6|5.0|Great news reader and I like the way the pages flip. My first source for news, sports and technology.  I recommend to those who use other readers.
B0099G3I96|1.0|You must just be hearing of No Doubt to find this album, an acceptable entry into there catalog. This has got to be the worst No Doubt album. The Album doesn't really have the journey I am use to from them. It's just so bland to me, nothing fun like old albums. Anyone who grew up with no doubt will think this is a whole new artist to begin with, I can't enjoy one song and I want to like it, just because I have always enjoyed No Doubt growing up and always thought of them as a fun band who put out great music, but either I grew away from this music or this album just doesn't live up to past showings. You may like this album, but for me this isn't anything I would come to expect from a great band in a prior decade.
B008N5UX9M|3.0|First off, I agree with the most common complaints here, that 1) the production is rather weak, and 2) the singer is pretty poor. But even given that, this is a decent collection of songs that, to my ears, mostly pay tribute to Harris' roots in Uriah Heep/UFO British hard rock of the early/mid 1970s. To be fair, I wouldn't have given this more than one listen if it weren't Steve Harris, but since it is him, and I did, I would say if you are a Maiden or Harris fan, and go in with realistic expectations, you'll find a decent album with some good hard rock songs on it. It's NOT great, and hopefully if Harris continues to do music outside of Maiden he'll go in different direction next time. It's basically a tribute to his earliest influences. Take that for what it's worth!
030758836X|3.0|I read this book and was so impressed by the author's creativity and her brilliance in constructing such an intriguing and well-crafted plot, however, as many others have stated, the ending is such a huge letdown.  I felt so cheated when I finished the book.  It really did seem as the author just wanted to finish writing the book and didn't really care how it ended.  It is really too bad because 3/4 of it is a fascinating story of a marriage that is storybook on the outside and absolutely sick and twisted on the inside.  The only reason I can think of for the author to end the book the way she did is that there is possibly a sequel in the works??  I won't read it however, she created two of the most narcissistic and unlikeable characters in recent memory.  The two of them really do deserve one another.
B008SVS3FC|4.0|When I heard Hiatt was putting out a new album, I immediately pre-ordered it. It arrived on it's release date and I listened to it 5 times straight through throughout the course of the day. Once again, Hiatt didn't disappoint. I think that this album is overall better than Open Road but not quite as good as Dirty Jeans (but that one is a tough act to beat). While there may be one or two songs I'll consider skipping when it comes on in my car, almost every song is just a real joy to listen to. Once again, Kevin Shirley nails the production. The album sounds great. Highly recommend it.
6305127697|5.0|I am literally beside myself concerning this movie, & that is unusual because I'm not easy to please where movies are concerned. At the ending I was not tremendously surprised, in fact it seemed predictable - but it was so well done that I didn't mind at all. 5 stars most assuredly!

0525953728|4.0|Ok, I was'nt going to read this book at first when I saw that it had quite a number of negative reviews. When I started reading the reviews I realized that the majority of the writers were possibly military personnel, which I am not. Just to make it clear i support our military and the sacrifice they've made for this country. With that being said I thought I'd give this book a shot. This book is just a synopsis of the seals deployments. I really enjoyed reading about the different situations these seals encountered in different countries. Of course the best one of all (KILLING OBL). Pretty much being side by side with the seals really kept me on my toes, and hungry for more. And I do understand the other reviews no one likes a trader, but after reading this book I can't say in all honesty that he is a trader,although there was a conflict in story's of how OBL was killed. Should he have consulted and allowed the pentagon or his superiors to review the book ABSOLUTELY! But I can't see any lives being at stake but he own (shame on him). So I just wanted to be fair and rate the book not his ignorance. So overall pretty good book.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I love the Reacher series, but I found this book less plausible than some of the past books.  Still, I was enthralled until we got into the bunker section. The way Reacher, and only Reacher, figured everything out was a bit farfetched, to me.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|great game totally fun but after awhile it get repitative I would give it 5 stars if there was some suprise to a level or 2
B0009HBN5U|5.0|[[ASIN:B0009HBN5U Jeeves & Wooster The Complete Collection Digitally Restored. All 23 episodes on 8 Discs in this Box set . [NON-USA Format / Import-United Kingdom / Region 2 / PAL] (DVD)]]<br />This is a marvelous collection.  It is silly funny humor & certainly grows on you.  The more you watch it the funnier it gets as every sentence seems to have more than one simple meaning!<br />If you love British humor this is the collection for you!
B000WCBPOG|4.0|I could go on about how I absolutely love this soundtrack and movie. I won't because that'd be boring.<br /><br />I'm only very disappointed they didn't include She's So Heavy, one of the most chilling scenes in the whole movie. I don't understand why, considering this is a two-disc set \\"Deluxe Edition.\\" Not so deluxe, eh? This is the only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five.<br /><br />Otherwise the music is played as it was in the movie despite being re-recorded. I couldn't tell the difference, personally.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Lana Del Rey seems heavily inspired by David Lynch's work. The songs on this album seem like an additional soundtrack to Twin Peaks, or even inspiration for a new film.<br /><br />People have criticized her for being \\"manufactured,\\" fake or insincere but what Del Rey is making is art. Much like Lady Gaga, Marilyn Manson and Gwar, her persona is something she created to make a statement and to fully support her artistic vision.<br /><br />Even if you dislike the person she is projecting, at least give the music a shot. Her compositions are complicated and moody, indicating a true musical talent. I look forward to hearing what she does next.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I really enjoyed this book while reading it and was prepared to tell all of my friends it was a must read. Then I made it to the last few chapters, and I was sorely disappointed. I'm not at all jaded and don't have to have a happy ending to everything, but this ending was just unacceptable. It completely ruined the book for me, and instead of my friends hearing about a must read, they heard about an ending that was total crap!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first and then read the book. I was sucked in from the start. I cant wait to start book 2.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book creates a believable imaginary world in which palace intrigue is a fixture of life, and impending doom threatens from the north.  Even the horse kingdom seems so much like what one imagines life with Ghengis Khan would have been like, that the birth of dragons in a fit of dark magic seems comprehensible.  I can't wait to read the next volume of the series and find out what people are so frightened about when they whisper \\"Winter is coming!\\"
B007HU4FJ8|5.0|Profound depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus. This film shows Jesus' true physical, emotional, and spiritual suffering in the original language. I imagine myself dealing with this kind of suffering to save mankind. I couldn't, could you?
1594481717|1.0|First for the good points.  There are a few factoids here and there that are pretty interesting but you should be careful because even some of those that appear like factoids are just speculations.<br /><br />Now for the bad.  The author seems to have no understanding of the situation the U.S. is in.  He thinks we went from agriculture, to manufacturing, to information, and now we'll go to a conceptual based economy.  He feels it is progress that we went from a manufacturing based economy to an information based economy, but the real world says otherwise.  The problem is the U.S. doesn't manufacture like it used to and the reason isn't because we've made progress but because the government has levied so many taxes and regulations on manufacturers that they've had to leave the country.  China can't make things cheaper because they're better than we are, it's just that their government doesn't punish them for actually making things.  Take a look at our trade deficit.  We import $40 billion worth of things we can't pay for every month, and we've been doing this for decades.  This can't go on forever and eventually we will have to make things ourselves again instead of relying on other countries to make things for us while we pay for those things with a credit card.<br /><br />With this general concept of right brained thinking and conceptual based work taking over the economy we see serious problems.  The author uses GM as an example, along with their CEO who said he'd use a right brained approach to running the company.  He said \\"what happens to GM happens to the country\\" and he's right, both are bankrupt.  GM is now government motors and they're insolvent without the government purchasing their vehicles.  This is the problem with thinking you can just use \\"conception\\" to create economic growth, you simply can't.  People have to produce things, they have to do so efficiently and effectively and a reasonable price.  GM and many like them can't and that's why they're introuble.<br /><br />The author claims companies should spend more time and money making things have aesthetic qualities but with so many people struggling to make ends meet, most of them aren't going to be willing to pay $10 more for a toaster with a \\"sleek new design\\" when they just need a toaster that works.<br /><br />The author repeatedly says how great it is that we have more and more people graduating with graphic design degrees because these are the types that will revolutionize things.  If that's so then why are these people either unemployed or working as waiters and waitresses?  The author needs to understand basic economic principles and the fact that companies need people who can add value.  They don't need people that learned (or didn't learn) useless skills in college.  These poor students go into severe debt and have no hope of working in their field because their field is not productive for most companies.<br /><br />The bottom line is we need knowledgeable workers that can help produce products, or provide services that are in demand and that doesn't mean spending a ton of money making things \\"pretty\\" when most people can't afford to pay the premium for that prettiness.  We can't have more companies like GM that can't even survive on their own merits.<br /><br />Bottom line, skip this book.  Daniel Pink's book Drive is a good book where he essentially discusses a lot of research.  This book is a series of opinions based on a lack of understanding of economics, business, and marketing.  If you read this book and believe it you'll be in trouble.
B005UKMWMY|5.0|I think the finale was perfect. I love House and have probably watched almost every episode and many several times. When I first starting watching it I thought he was such an annoying ass. I think you have to commit to the show and get to know House and why he is the way he is. Like people have mentioned what he did in the finale was the most selfless act a person could do. He loved his job. I think what he loved was the challenge of it. To just drop everything and walk away would be unimaginable for most people. In the end, through the tears I was shedding his character had become so real to me that I could just imagine in my mind House and Wilson riding on Route 66 out west. Like it was real. That's what makes a great show!!
B001V7UXG2|5.0|I have the 2002 version of this set and have been waiting for a digitally restored version to be released.  I found it on Amazon UK-  the restored set was released a year ago and has english subtitles.  The price for the remastered set is less than this older release.  Since its been out for a year, hopefully a release for region 1 players is planned.  Another option would be to buy a multi-region DVD player and avoid the wait.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|First impression:  Dark!  Ironically, the album begins with a bright \\"poppy\\" kind of tune (Duquesne Whistle) which fools you into thinking ol' Bob has turned over a new leaf.  But no, the album wallows in deception and gets dark and moody real fast.  Any doubts about this albums intended mood should be immediately evident from the Title alone (\\"Tempest\\"), but also from the dark album art and the black colored disc face itself. Give a listen to \\"Pay In Blood\\" for the essence of this album. The Devil speaks.<br />Bright spots, for me, were \\"Tin Angel\\", \\"Tempest\\", and \\"Scarlet Town\\"... and of course, \\"Pay In Blood\\".
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this game is an awesome. it is fun and addicting. I especially like how you can level up and get power up coins to get certain things. I recommend this game to people who like arcade games!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|The $1.99 is definitely worth it. My 3.5 yr old girl loves this app. After playing for awhile, we discovered hidden nuggets in the game that help your patients feel better :-)<br />I hope they make more Dr. Panda apps. The Restaurant and Preschool are worth it too.

B008C1O8CA|3.0|I'll start by saying that I first got into Green Day during the Dookie/Insomniac era, back when I was 15. Over the years, my respect for the band grew with every release as they pushed their skills and musical/lyrical themes. I loved their underrated Warning and was more than pleased with their exuberant American Idiot, which gladly started a new chapter revitalizing their career. Then 21st Century Breakdown came, proving to be another solid record despite the mammoth undertaking of creating a second, culturally-relevant rock opera without coming across as repetitive. So how could they follow up their 2009 three-act opus and make a new name for themselves in the new decade? The answer seems to come in the form of a loosely-knit concept that spans not only 3 acts, but 3 full-length albums. Let me say that when I first heard of the new trilogy I knew that they were capable of pulling it off (and I still believe they have what it takes), although I also suspected that the new records might end up being comprised of what would otherwise have been cast aside as b-sides. Unfortunately--at least with ¡Uno!--the case seems to be the latter.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is a decent rock album. Billie Joe, Mike and Tré have honed their musical skills over a 25 year career of consistent composing and performing, and the album is a collection of well-crafted tunes. However, they quickly wane under the shadow of Green Day's legacy. They do try new things musically and the album draws influences ranging from Billy Idol to the later days of The Clash (Kill The DJ sounds a lot like The Magnificent Seven and could have been the most refreshing song on the record albeit it suffers due to the lackluster lyrics). However, the problem I see with the record lies in the repetitive nature of many songs (Carpe Diem is disappointingly similar to both Suffocate and Before The Lobotomy at times) and it seems like Billie Joe probably spent less time working in the lyrics department this time around, as for the most part words seem put together with little scrutiny. The F word is gratuitously thrown around in this one, making it lose its intended effect and even turning it into an annoying reiteration (again, Kill The DJ could have been such a great song).<br /><br />I think Green Day would have benefitted from taking a slightly more conservative approach with this new collection of songs. It might have been wiser to put together one solid-as-rock album with the best songs from all 3 records (we've yet to hear ¡Dos! and ¡Tré! but so far I'd say one-third of ¡Uno! would qualify as a-side material) and perhaps release the remaining songs as a second collection of outtakes like they did with Shenanigans in 2002.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book was excellent.  It showed the dedication the Seal Teams have for themselves and their country. The work involved in becoming a Seal member only a few can accomplish. In my personal opinion whatever was in the book had already been reported by the media and therefore I don't feel there was any leak of classified information. It is a good read for all Americans.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a great game. I play it all the time. I wish I could see more of the map though. even if I cant build there I can plan.
B003XU02QG|1.0|i tried to get thru this movie but it was slow in every-way. zzzzz The acting was, well, not really there.  I just think the story line was lacking so the actors did not have a chance.  I like this type of movie, IE 300 - but this ones lacking
B008C1O8CA|5.0|This album is like a modern version of pre-Dokie era. Very energetic, simplistic and catchy at the same time. It's not their best album, but it's worth getting a higher reviews and appreciation. Overall, this is a good beginning of the big journey.<br />I am pretty sure that DOS and TRE going to be even better.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I enjoy using this app. its easy to use and I never have to worry about recalculating my last problem.

The guitar is weak and the rest of these guys seem to not put their all into it, or like something is missing. It is not bad or great, I will listen to it some more maybe it will grow on me. This just how it sounds through my ears, otherwise just my own opinion.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Recently, Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl has gotten a lot of buzz. My husband, a psychologist, and bookaholic friend Jeana, a social worker, have read all of her books and have had good things to say...especially about the mental health status of the characters. Intrigued, I borrowed hubby's e-book of Sharp Objects and gave it a whirl.<br /><br />I won't lie. At first, I had a very difficult time getting into this book. Flynn has a very distinct style of writing with descript, but fragmented and incomplete sentences littered throughout the story. At first, it drove me nuts and I wasn't sure that I even wanted to finish. By 25% in, I was able to acclimate and realized that this stylized narrative was probably a choice made by the author. If so, it was a rather clever one. The main character and our narrator, Camille, is a bit off kilter (to put it mildly) as is the entire story. So the choppy and somewhat abrupt writing helps to draw the reader into her frame of mind.<br /><br />As for characters, Camille is trying to find the light in a loveless life that has been filled with dark desperation. Throughout the book, she constantly battles the urge to carve words into her skin - her primary coping mechanism other than alcohol abuse. When she's feeling especially stressed or down, scars of the words tend to buzz or pulse. This was a super smart and creative way for Flynn to bring the reader into Camille's personal hell. Her mother, Adora, half sister, Amma, and step-father, Alan, are all odd balls with their own well-developed idiosyncrasies that will have you shaking your head in disbelief. Finally, the whole town of Wind Gap seems to have a collective closet full of skeletons, penchant for gossip, and habit of turning a (selective) blind eye. The only semblance of normalcy is the out of town detective from Kansas City, Richard.<br /><br />As I was warned, Gillian Flynn's Sharp Objects was heavy, dark, and most certainly disturbing. It paints an un-pretty and unsettlingly realistic portrait of evil. The plot was carefully crafted with a steady pace that kept me reading, on edge, and hoping I wasn't going to have messed up dreams and nightmares for weeks following the conclusion. Throughout this read, you'll feel exactly how Flynn wants you to - icky and unwell with a serious case of anxiety that you can't quite shake... and it gets progressively worse as you read on. I finished the book considering gender stereotypes of violence, mental illness, cruelty, love, death, murder and so much more. I would absolutely recommend this book to adults who aren't afraid of a dark, sinister psychological thriller. Warning: subject matters include self-mutilation, drug abuse, promiscuity and exploitation of young girls (13 yrs.), abuse, and severe bullying, among others.
B002RI9HUM|3.0|The plot was not exactly what i was expecting but then again I did not look much further than the title and star rating. Overall was entertaining and I did read to the very end. I liked the fact that the book appeared to be fairly well researched.  Not the most exciting book ever but definitely an entertaining read.
B005LAIGN2|1.0|Mr. Lucas' Opus Magnum it isn't. The last 2 decades have produced a lot of<br />mediocre WW2 movies. But most of them were low budget indie movies. Therefore<br />one did not expect too much.<br /><br />Well, Mr. Lucas managed to achieve an even lower quality by wasting a lot of<br />money. The acting (and uttering of the atrocious dialogue) could be done better<br />by any reenactment group.  The arial compact scenes might look impressive at first<br />but are absolutely unrealistic.<br /><br />And the story line is the WW2 equivalent of a cheap Italian softporn movie.<br />Cutboard characters (bad white officers, good black soldiers, evil Nazi Germans),<br />implausible events (shortest captivity ever, Pilot taking multiple 30mm rounds<br />before dying, P51 being nearly as fast as the ME262 etc.).<br /><br />So, don't waste you hard earned cash on this abominal mess of a film.<br />If the Topic suits you, see the original HBO film or Buffalo Soldiers 44.<br />Both not perfect but worlds ahead of this lousy waste of resources.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Aside from being a fun movie overall the Blu-ray's PQ(picture quality) is one of the best to date. The Avengers PQ i would say is only rivaled by the IMAX scenes from The Dark Knight and maybe another hand full of movies. If i didnt know any better, i would say it is on par with IMAX scenes. 5 out of 5 PQ. The SQ(sound quality) is another highlight of this release. Not since the Transformer BD have i heard better quality. every backround noise, every spark flying is clearly heard. the lossless audio track is pure ear candy. Lastly the 3D quality is also top notch. the 3D effect has much more pop than most other 3D blus i've seen. all in all this BD release gets a 5 out of 5 from me, as expected from a Disney release

B008LA7RM0|4.0|PET SOUNDS has been issued a number of times on CD, initially in 1990, with three mono bonus tracks: &#34;Unreleased Backgrounds&#34; (a snippet of &#34;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)&#34;); an instrumental called &#34;Trombone Dixie&#34; (both of which later appeared in stereo on [[ASIN:B000002U4U The Pet Sounds Sessions]] box set); and &#34;Hang On To Your Ego&#34; (the original lyric for &#34;I Know There's An Answer&#34;).  Next, several tracks, including an alternate take of &#34;Ego,&#34; were issued on the 1993 box set [[ASIN:B000002UR4 Good Vibrations: Thirty Years Of The Beach Boys]].  After that came the wonderful 1996 (released in 1997) box set [[ASIN:B000002U4U The Pet Sounds Sessions]], which featured the first-ever true stereo mix of the album, plus instrumental-only and vocal-only tracks (including an early take of &#34;Good Vibrations&#34;), alternate takes, and the remastered original mono album.  The stereo mix (along with the original mono version) was released as an individual CD in both 1999 and 2001; I'm not sure what the differences between the two versions were, except that one of them may have had the original 1990 version of &#34;Ego,&#34; the other the later version from 1993 and 1996, and that the 2001 version had a reconstructed mix of &#34;Wouldn't It Be Nice,&#34; with Mike Love's original mono bridge vocal dubbed into the stereo master.  The 1990 release of &#34;Hang On To Your Ego&#34; had no background vocals, but later releases do. I own the  [[ASIN:B000002U4U The Pet Sounds Sessions]] box set, and in the past had both the 1990 and 2001 CD issues; currently I own the [[ASIN:B000G03Q2S Pet Sounds 40th Anniversary CD+DVD (Limited Edition Fuzzy Package)]], which I believe is essentially the same as the 2001 release, except for the possible restoration of the original &#34;Hang On To Your Ego&#34; (the liner notes state that it is the original 1987 mix (issued in 1990) without background vocals, but the actual track on the CD and DVD contains background vocals), with a bonus DVD containing both a high-resolution stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix of the album (including &#34;Ego,&#34; which is in high-resolution mono), plus three mini-documentaries (including one with the late Sir George Martin), three promotional films, and a photo gallery set to &#34;God Only Knows.&#34;<br /><br />This 2012 reissue is a straightforward reissue of the mono and stereo mixes of the album, without &#34;Ego&#34; or any of the other bonus tracks.  It sounds a little brighter than the 40th Anniversary Edition, or the versions on [[ASIN:B000002U4U The Pet Sounds Sessions]] box set, but is not radically better.  The packaging is also rather skimpy; the digipak has the front cover art with a white banner, the back cover art on the left inside flap, a picture of The Boys from the San Diego Zoo on the right inside flap, and a small picture of the band on the back cover, with the mono and stereo track listings.  The booklet consists of four pages - front cover, back cover, and the track listings on the inside.<br /><br />If you don't have PET SOUNDS, and want the original album without extras, this new version is for you.  Otherwise, I would stick with either the 40th Anniversary Edition or the 2001 version, and I would also recommend either [[ASIN:B000002U4U The Pet Sounds Sessions]] box set or the new [[ASIN:B01DB0EB7S Pet Sounds 50th Anniversary Deluxe Edition]], if you don't own the former (see below).<br /><br />HISTORICAL NOTE: In addition to the single releases &#34;Wouldn't It Be Nice&#34; / &#34;God Only Knows&#34; (Capitol 5706), &#34;Sloop John B.&#34; / &#34;You're So Good To Me&#34; (Capitol 5602), &#34;Good Vibrations&#34; / &#34;Let's Go Away For A While&#34; (Capitol 5676), and the Brian Wilson single &#34;Caroline, No&#34; / &#34;Summer Means New Love&#34; (Capitol 5610), another song from PET SOUNDS was also issued as a single: &#34;Here Today,&#34; issued as the B-side of &#34;Darlin',&#34;  atrack from [[ASIN:B01BMIREJS Wild Honey]] (Capitol 2068). In addition, the stereo version of &#34;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&#34; was issued as a single in 1996 on the indie Sub Pop label.<br /><br />PET SOUNDS is not the best Beach Boys album - [[ASIN:B008LA7RMK The Beach Boys Today!]] and [[ASIN:B008LA7REI Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!]] get that co-honor - but it is, as the English say, a good 'un, nonetheless.<br /><br />2017 UPDATE: I originally pre-ordered the new [[ASIN:B01DB0EB7S Pet Sounds 50th Anniversary Deluxe Edition]] on Amazon (May 25, 2016), but when I saw the track listing on Universal Music's Web site, I discovered that I already owned about 90 percent of the tracks (save for 11 live versions (recorded at different venues between 1966 and 1993)  and three alternate mixes: a vocal-only version of &#34;I Know There's An Answer,&#34; an alternate remix of the same song, and a new stereo remix of &#34;Good Vibrations&#34; with a partial vocal track) on [[ASIN:B000002U4U The Pet Sounds Sessions]]. The only other difference is that the mono version in the new collection (found on Disc 1 together with the stereo version, instead of on a separate bonus disc [Disc 4 on the 1997 collection]) is mastered from the [[ASIN:B00FIXN2EU 1972 Brother/Reprise reissue of Pet Sounds]] (Brother/Reprise MS 2197, also issued as a double LP with [[ASIN:B00B9JWZMW Carl And The Passions-So Tough]] [Brother/Reprise 2MS 2083]), supervised by Carl Wilson, instead of the original Capitol master. In addition, four of the &#34;Alternate Versions&#34; on the original box set's third disc (the two promos for the Brian Wilson solo single, &#34;Caroline, No,&#34; &#34;Hang On To Your Ego,&#34; and the aforementioned vocal snippet of &#34;Don't Talk...&#34;) have been moved to the end of Disc 1 on the new collection. Plus, since I didn't own a Blu-ray player then, I could not play the bonus Blu-ray audio disc. Since there was a DVD-Audio disc in the 40th Anniversary Edition,they opted for a Blu-ray version this time around. The DVD also contains video material that is not on the Blu-ray disc (see my comments above). So I cancelled the order at the time.<br /><br />Because I now own a Sony multi-region Blu-ray player, I reversed myself and purchased the 50th Anniversary Edition on July 15, 2017. The Blu-ray audio-only disc contains PCM mono, stereo, and stereo instrumental versions of the album, plus two 5.1 mixes (Dolby True HD and DTS 5.1 Master Audio - not much difference between the two on my sound system). A bonus section for stereo and 5.1 listeners contains six additional tracks: the aforementioned &#34;Unreleased Backgrounds,&#34; the vocal snippet of &#34;Don't Talk...&#34; originally issued in mono on the 1990 CD, but now in stereo and 5.1 on the Blu-ray audio disc (after further review, [[ASIN:B000002U4U The Pet Sounds Sessions]] vocal snippet of &#34;Don't Talk...,&#34; also on Disc 1 of the 50th Anniversary collection, is exactly the same as &#34;Unreleased Backgrounds&#34;), a couple of alternate versions of the &#34;Wouldn't It Be Nice&#34;/&#34;God Only Knows&#34; single, and the beautiful instrumental &#34;Summer Means New Love,&#34; a track originally from [[ASIN:B008LA7REI Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!]], which is included here because it was later issued as the B-side of the aforementioned Brian Wilson solo single &#34;Caroline, No.&#34; The Blu-ray audio sounds great, especially the 5.1 mixes.<br /><br />HISTORICAL NOTE: I haven't listened to the two &#34;Caroline, No&#34; promos in a long time, so when I heard them again recently, I had forgotten that the DJs mentioned were both from the Baltimore/Washington area where I grew up. One promo is for Kerby Scott of Baltimore's WCAO (he also had a teenage dance show on Baltimore's WBAL-TV, and worked in D.C. for a while as well). I don't know what happened to Kerby Scott, but he is probably retired. The other promo is for the late, great Johnny Dark, who worked at WEAM, Arlington, Virginia, at the time of the promo, and also worked at WCAO for many years. On September 13, 1964, Johnny was onstage at the Baltimore Civic Center (now the Royal Farms Arena) introducing The Beatles in their first and only appearance in Charm City (Ringo Starr And His All-Starr Band have returned to Baltimore twice, but Paul McCartney has never been back (you owe Baltimore one, Macca; it's been over half a century)). WCAO switched from Top 40 to country music in the early '80s, and has programmed Black Gospel music since the '90s (as &#34;Heaven 600&#34;). More recently, Dark worked at Washington's WBIG-FM (when it was Oldies 100; it is now classic-rock BIG 100.3, or just BIG 100), and his last gig before his death last fall [2016] was at WTTR-AM 1470, an oldies/classic hits station in Westminster, Maryland. RIP, Johnny - you were to music what the late Hall of Famer Chuck Thompson was to sports broadcasting.<br /><br />Casual Beach Boys fans can probably skip this new release; those who already own [[ASIN:B000002U4U The Pet Sounds Sessions]] should only purchase it if they want the Blu-ray audio disc and the 14 extra tracks not found on the previous set. The  50th Anniversary collection is an essential purchase only for those who don't already own [[ASIN:B000002U4U The Pet Sounds Sessions]] or for hard-core completists.
B008SVFX96|4.0|In my opinion, Richie's two previous solo albums (\\"Stranger In Town\\" and \\"Undiscovered Soul\\") are about as opposite as two albums can be. I think \\"Stranger In Town\\" is a GREAT rock n roll album from start to finish. It was criminally overlooked when it was initially released back in the early 90s. \\"Undiscovered Soul\\" is...not good. I don't know what was going on with that album, but I just could not get into it. At all. So with this album, I had no idea what to expect. I'm happy to report this album is WAY better than \\"Undiscovered Soul\\", but still a step or two behind \\"Stranger In Town\\". In places, it has a signature 80s production sound/feel, while in other places, it sounds very modern (someone in another review mentioned Foo Fighters on the song 'Nowadays'. That's a perfect comparison). Most importantly, the album is a legitimate rock n roll album. Not a metal album, not a modern rock album, not a pop album. Just a straight ahead rock n roll album. There are definitely some hints of the Bon Jovi sound (How could there not be?), but it doesn't sound like a Bon Jovi knockoff. Richie's playing is still top-notch, and lyrically, it covers all the standard emotions a traditional rock n roll album generally covers. If you're looking for a sound that will redefine the future of music, it ain't here. If you're looking for good-time melodic rock, with a few ballads mixed in, this is a solid album. Highly recommended!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i love this game it was my favorite to play at the fair but they stopped im sure glad its on here now
B00122IYJY|5.0|This is the Album that changed rock n roll. Every song on this album is pure energy and all balls(except \\"you really got me\\" don't care much for the cover).<br />What followed this album are a bunch of imitators (like em or not), and influenced a generation of guitar players.<br /><br />This album is a must have for rock fans and guitarist.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|There's so much more we know and think about when we get older.  At 20, we are idealistic and hopeful.  In our 40's, we know a little more how the world works with it's gifts and disappointments.  At 71, Bod Dylan embodies a man in his twilight years reflecting on what most people do in that stage; life, death, and memories of lost friends.  I enjoy recent Dylan as much as early Dylan, for the mere reason that he is still getting it done.  On a completely different level, yes, but it is still good; a soundtrack for life.  On the song \\"Long and Wasted Years\\", he sounds like an older man rambling about things gone by, relationships wasted; just like he's rattling off random thoughts to an old friend - it is one of the real charmers for me on this record.  Dylan is not trying to sound like anything or anyone - he just tells stories from where he is right now.  I wonder what would happen if The Rolling Stones made a record that sounded like where they are in life now, as opposed to trying to sound like the fresh faced rockers who invaded this country in the 60's?  \\"Tempest\\" is something you have to buy and invest time in - just listening to the samples and making judgements won't work for this great collection of songs.
0385333846|5.0|One of the greatest American novels of all time.<br />This book is funny, serious, makes you think, inventive, and the writing is great.<br />This and Cat's Cradle are my favorite Vonnegut books, and are among my favorite books of all time.<br />I'm not going to go into the plot as many reviewers have done so already. I just wanted to express my appreciation for this wonderful novel.<br /><br />God Bless you, Mr Vonnegut!
B003SNJYSK|5.0|If you're following Jo Nesbo, and especially Harry Hole, this is a great book. Wonderfully written. As good as The Snowman.<br />Story and characters which keep you on edge until you finish the book! Can't have enough of Harry Hole's adventures, or more precisely his misadventures.
038533348X|5.0|This book is one of my favorite books of all time. I recently because a huge fan of Kurt Vonnegut, after Slaughterhouse Five and Breakfast of Champions, I read Cat's Cradle.<br />I don't want to make comparisons, but once I started this book I just couldn't put it down. There are so many good and insightful lines that really makes you think.<br />A good look at the role of science, technology, and religion.<br />I'm not quite sure why this is counted in the Humor, while it has plenty of funny parts in the book, it's definitely not as much of a comedy as Breakfast of Champions.
0439023521|4.0|This book is aimed at a young audience - young teenager and I am old enough to be a grandmother to anyone in that audience. I did not expect to love this book as much as I did.<br />Yet I could not put it down. The challenge, the conflicts, the psychology are stark and brutal and all too real. It can be read at many levels and contains enough obvious (12 districts and Rue - the name of one of the contestants) and hidden symbolism (the bird) to fascinate many readers.<br />It is Romeo and Juliet and Gladiators vs. Christians and other mythical and real historical situations all wound together.<br />Somehow the writer maanges to give us just enough information to describe the situation, the characters and the conflict without overdoing it.<br />I would also agree with one negative comment that another writer ahs - the characters do seem a little woodened. Then again the characters are very young adults just learning about life who have lived a very restricted life. They have adult thoughts and childish ones too. So the characters may not be all that wooden - just not developed as a more adult character would.<br />The book has some flaws. For instance I could not understand how all the people from a huge district could all come together in one spacefor the tribute choosing or to watch the conflict. Nevertheless, those small details did not matter much.<br />I am looking forward to reading book 2 and 3 now.
B0076UXKDG|5.0|[I gave this 5 stars for the function and form and not the price. The price IS high - atleast based by what I can afford - but thats my problem not Nikon's]<br /><br />I almost decided not buy the Nikon battery grip and wait it out for 3rd party version for about 10-15% the cost of the mbd12 (originally $600)<br /><br />But then the price dropped to about $400.<br /><br />Also started hearing some stories of the 3rd party grips failing or worse yet causing problems on the camera. The last thing I want is Nikon service voiding my warranty because I \\"caused\\" the issue with a 3rd party grip. So I figured its a small investment for piece of mind for a $3K camera + lens.<br /><br />The actual grip fits better than the nikon mbd10 did on my d300s. Theres no play between the camera and the grip. The screw wheel doesn't jiggle loosely constantly. They've done a much better job in this area.<br /><br />The shutter release button has more tension than before.. The old one could be triggered way too easily if you brushed it against something.<br /><br />Update: I've been using it a about half a week now and sort like the older looser button since I feel like I more likely to \\"shake\\" the d800 ... and there are enough stories about how this camera cant be used hand held. :)<br /><br />The 4 way joystick is snug (in a good way) but I've only had it a few day.<br /><br />When i took the battery cartridge out you get a nice view of the cross section of the grip.  Its plastic on the outside with a clear layer of metal on the inside. There also a seperate metal plate that runs the full length of the side where the screw is. very sturdy looking. Also explains the weight of this grip.<br /><br />The really big changes i noticed from my 300s' mb-d10:<br /><br />The grip has two guide posts (one being longer and metal) that go into the camera as you're screwing it in.<br /><br />The old school electric contacts are replaced with a PC style male/female coupling, which is surrounded by a plastic guide. This protects it and acts as a guide when you're attaching it. I think this design change will get rid of the corrosion, dust, etc that could be seen on my d300s battery contacts.<br /><br />Overall its a small price to pay for a seemingly better thought out / engineered equipment & peace of mind should anything go wrong.<br /><br />Its a shame Nikon doesnt advertise all these changes.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app!!!!!! it tells me whenever my battery is low and whenever I need to charge it. I use it all the time. it really helps out.
B007I2BZIE|2.0|Like a lot of music these days, this sounds over compressed and washed out with too much over dubbing.  It may sound best on very flatly equalized near field studio monitors, but does not sound good with headphones (at least the ones I've tried: AKG & Bose).  I have had to fiddle with equalization all the time to get the songs to punch me in the face more.  Geddy's vocals are often difficult to understand.  I am going to run it through my PA speakers and see how it sounds then, maybe I'm missing something important -- that I just can't catch the groove of yet...<br /><br />That being said the song writing is interesting and artful and tightly performed.  It doesn't seem all that progressive to me though, in the sense of being breakthrough or edgy -- not even many tricky time signature changes.<br /><br />It's still Rush and what's not to love about these guys.  God bless them and you!
B006O6F932|4.0|This arrived yesterday and my 10 year Monster fan daughter went crazy.  My favorite part of this set is how it folds up!  OMG I just kept unfolding it when I took it out of the box and was SOO impressed with how big it ends up for easy play with multiple dolls and kids, and then folds up to stash away in a cupboard and not be one of those huge toys that are constantly being tripped over.  I would not say it will be highly durable for rough play,  but for it's concept of being portable it is impressive.  My box was missing the sticker and desk directions so that was a bit annoying but not a big deal.  My daughter loved all the choices of play here.  different classrooms, desks, picnic table, basketball hoop, lockers even a small second story loft area.  It had cute accessories my daughter really liked.  gargoyles, lab supplies, locks for the lockers and random school supplies.  Yes there is a lot of accessories that do not fit in the folded up school, but we have a monster high bin for dolls and all of their accessories so we just pile them in there.  My daughter would give it 5 stars for fun and excitement over the product, I give it 4 because it will have durability flaws in my opinions and the girls were having issues with dolls staying in the desks.  They did not care.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Mark Owen gives a professional account of what it is like to be a DEVGRU Operator on the modern battle field. While killing Bin Laden was a hugely significant historical event, Owen demonstrates that it was executed like so many other difficult, dangerous and less publicized  SEAL Ops.<br /><br />We have read the detailed accounts of SEAL BUD/S training from other sources like Marcus Luttrell, so Owen does not spend an inordinate amount of time re-plowing this ground.

B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I am surprised that so many people gave the book 5 stars.  I expected it to be more believable and thought the characters would develop more depth.  The first half of the book kept me interested but after that it was too drawn out, uninteresting, and pretty violent with all of the very descriptive fight scenes.
B008A1NSTG|3.0|I enjoyed the movie.  I had forgotten about the true story and it was nice to be reminded.  The Greenpeace character was a little over the top.
B003UESJ9M|1.0|This is just another silly faux-country movie about a washed-up has-been.  The main problem is Gwyneth Paltrow: she simply is not believable.  Although she has a passable voice, her fake accent and terrible acting muddy up the whole movie.  Her acting was so bad, I kept wishing she would go away.  (I mean, doesn't GOOP need her to blog about her famous recipe for PB&J sandwiches??)  Two hours of my life I can never get back.

0061743526|5.0|I may be the only American under 60 who graduated from high school without having read Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\"  I'd heard about it, of course; I knew there were characters named Atticus Finch and Scout (a girl), and that there was a trial involving racism.  Unlike so many other classics I haven't yet read, however, this one was never \\"spoiled\\" for me, so when I sat down earlier this week to patch up the gap in my reading, I was coming to it as nearly fresh as possible, with only the vaguest idea what I had to look forward to.<br /><br />As the novel opens, the narrator, Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch, professes to tell the reader how her older brother Jem came to break his arm at the elbow years before.  It's a long story, and by the time the unfortunate young man suffers his injury over 250 pages later, not only Jem's arm but the complacency of a small Southern town will be shattered.  The first quarter of the novel offers little hint of the drama that is to unfold; the plucky and precocious Scout, growing up in the early 1930s in Maycomb, Alabama, seems to have only the typical concerns of childhood to ruffle her otherwise tranquil existence: well-meaning but clueless teachers, her brother's occasional bouts of pubescent moodiness, neighbors and relatives who scoff at her tomboyish ways.  Scout enjoys reading with her lawyer father, Atticus; spending time in the kitchen with her family's black cook, Calpurnia; and visiting Miss Maudie, an amiable neighbor.  She, Jem, and their friend Dill, who comes to Maycomb every summer to stay with his aunt, enjoy acting out stories from their favorite books and attempting to coax their enigmatic, reclusive neighbor Boo Radley out of his house.  Everything changes, however, when Atticus is assigned to defend Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman, and accepts this assignment with diligence and zeal.  Suddenly Atticus becomes an icon of his town's hopes and a target for its hatreds - and inevitably, his family gets caught up in the mounting storm.<br /><br />\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is simply wonderful, in every way a novel can be.  Scout is a lovable character, whose equal parts innocence and precocity make her the perfect narrator for a story a more mature character might have been too world-weary to tell with such honesty.  Atticus is one of the greatest heroes in fiction, yet there is nothing effortless about his integrity, and he never comes across as self-righteous or too good to be true.  This novel is ethical and wise without ever becoming preachy, suspenseful and dramatic without ever becoming sensational, humorous without becoming silly, realistic without becoming cynical, uplifting without the slightest hint of sentimentality.  In a day when \\"moral ambiguity\\" in literature so often means the absence of any real concept of good or evil, and \\"social justice\\" too often means seeing the world in (sometimes literal) shades of black and white, it's refreshing to see how neatly Lee escapes both pitfalls, populating her novel with characters not merely lovable in spite of their flaws, but basically good at heart, or at least striving for decency, while living in and partaking of a poisonous social order they've simply never thought to question.<br /><br />Books like this are precious and rare.  If you've somehow managed, like me, to make it into adulthood without ever reading it, do yourself a favor and pick it up now.  And if you're still in school, don't wait for it to show up on some mandatory reading list.  Read it, as I did, the way it was meant to be read - for the pure, pure pleasure of it.his family gets caught up in the mounting storm.<br /><br />\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is simply wonderful, in every way a novel can be.

B0042X9L6A|3.0|I sadly have been disappointed with the sb-700. I bought it because I thought it would be a good backup flash in a pinch, but to tell you the truth I've found it to be worthless. Many people tried to tell me when I bought it that it was like a mini sb-900 with almost all the same features just half the power output (I should have done more research). It doesn't play nice with pocketwizards, it has dumbed down the controls to a non useful state, and my old sb-600 have more power than this unit. To add insult to injury I just had to send it for a 130 dollar repair because the ttl mode started firing too early and therefor doesn't light up subjects. Sadly my unit is just past a year old so it isn't covered by warranty. I really should have just spent the extra money on a sb-900( I have two and they are worth it!).
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, perhaps not as much its predecessor, but none the less it was a great read.  Regarding the story there is little that I can add to the other 5 star reviews.  My reason for writing this is to counter balance all the negative reviews that by and large are complaints about the $20 price tag rather than a critique of the work.  At first glance the price seems a bit steep but when you consider that this is roughly a thousand page novel (twice the average length) then the pricing seems reasonable.  Assuming one reads a page a minute it would take 16 hours to finish the 960 page story.  16 hours of quality entertainment for $20 - seems like a deal to me.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|Fit the falling blocks together by turning and placing them so there are no gaps. In this game, though, completing a line does not make the blocks vanish, but matching numbered blocks so they add up to the current level's magic number. A nice little app for practicing simple math skills coupled with quick thinking. Unfortunately my math-incapable brain wasn't able to keep up with it but I would still recommend it as it is a good concept, runs well and is simple to control.
B007THA4FI|3.0|OK I didnt read this book.  I confess that along with others I find 18 too much for my reading budget.  I also have often found that a bit of patience can reward one with a substantially lowered price.  However, I am shocked by the moral judgements reflected in some of these reviews.  How much money an author already possesses has little to do with the value of her work.  Writing something people really want to read does require hard work.  This work does deserve monetary compensation.  So the kindle edition is not a simple download worth nothing because there is no paper.  Wake up you are paying for the WORDS.

0062206281|4.0|Picking this up to read I wondered if I would be able to remember all that had gone before in the first two novels in this series. No problem, I at once enjoyed being back in the familiar territory of the Sempre bookshop and recollections of The Shadow of the Wind and The Angels Game were easily recalled. The explanation at the front of The Prisoner of Heaven reminds us that it is part of a cycle of novels set in the literary universe of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books of which the previous novels were the first two instalments. It also goes on to say that although each novel is an independent story they are all interconnected by common characters and storylines. The claim is made quite correctly that for this reason the novels can be read in any order, enabling the reader to weave their own path to the heart of the narrative. I do not refute this but personally feel more comfortable with the fact that I have read them in order of publication.<br /><br />The writing is just like in the previous volumes so atmospheric that you get a strong feeling of how Barcelona must have felt in the early nineteen forties and the late nineteen fifties, the two periods we are swapped between in The Prisoner of Heaven. We meet many of the same characters but in this novel the protagonist is Fermin Romero de Torres as he relates his story to Daniel Sempre in the fifties. Daniel is now married with a young son and helping his father run the family bookshop, which is struggling to survive. The appearance in the shop of a mysterious stranger who threatens to expose Fermin's secret, means that after all these years he at last has to tell Daniel the truth about his past. Daniel and Fermin find themselves embarking on a dangerous adventure teeming with lies, reprisals, resentment and suspicion as they search for the truth.<br /><br />This third novel in the Cemetery of Forgotten Books series I found to be a real page turner that I finished far too quickly, leaving me eagerly awaiting the next instalment due to the ending leaving us knowing there is so much more to come. I can recommend this to anyone that enjoyed the first two, although you will be surprised in that this is a much easier to follow instalment. Still I am left wondering just how the author is going to tie together all the storylines into the final novel. There is a lot left to be explained to the reader, some of which I am a little confused about but have no intention of mentioning here for fear of spoilers, we will just have to wait, hopefully not to long!ext instalment due to the ending leaving us knowing there is so much more to come.

0143120530|4.0|Joshua Foer's Moonwalking With Einstein is a wonderful mutant of a book. Part memoir, part instruction manual, Moonwalking details not only Foer's journey from Average Journalist to Memory Champion, but also the techniques of and science behind his success. With humor and revelation, Foer's crisp narrative imparts ancient wisdom and modern application dedicated to exploring the mysterious realm of memory. His writing is energetic and precise, but gives the reader room to breathe and ponder how best to use the techniques Foer learns in his or her life.<br /><br />But far more than teaching memory techniques, Moonwalking With Einstein instills the reader with a new respect and awe for the human brain: what it remembers; what it forgets; and how little we still know about it.

B000URWYTS|5.0|It's hard to believe that this is Nancy Horan's first novel. This was a compelling, well-researched, and enjoyable read. I never knew much about Frank Lloyd Wright before this, except for some knowledge about his architecture, and his reputation of being a scoundrel. This book gave me a more \\"rounded out\\" look at the man -- more understanding of how he earned that reputation, but also the tender, loving side he possessed, and some insight into his genius. Granted, this is a piece of historical fiction, but very well written and believable.<br /><br />Also, I knew nothing about Mamah Cheney Borthwick, and meeting her was a real pleasure! I don't agree with all of her views, but one doesn't have to to like her. I have to admit, she was a great match for FLW!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!

030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl: Gillian Flynn<br /><br />Just how far will one man go to prove his love for his wife? Just how far will she go to test it? Gone Girl is an interesting novel based in two time periods. The main character, Nick Dunne relates in his own unique voice his present state of mind, meeting his wife, his hopes for their future and his new career working with his sister in a Bar named The Bar. As we get to know him better we realize that his relationship with his sister is quite close and his wife's distant with his family. Nick's story or narrative takes place in the present. Meeting Amy we learn about her as she introduces the reader to her first impressions and encounters with Nick. Bowled over, over the top and head over heels for him you can feel the energy between them as she shares her diary with the reader. But, Amy's behavior is often erratic and things change as the reader comes to know her better and realizes that she disappears but how and why? Gone Girl is just that a story about a wife whose sudden disappearance changes the lives of many but mainly Nick. As you hear the voices told in alternating chapters from a soft pianissimo to a loud crescendo when things crash and life takes on a much different turn. Can you marry someone and think they are one person and learn they are really another? Can your life be turned upside because circumstances look as if you are guilty?<br /><br />As he hear Amy tell about her feelings about Nick we begin to wonder why she decided to marry him and just how solid her mind is when listening to her voice. As we fast forward to the present Nick is alert by a friend that his house has not been locked and the door is wide open. Entering the front door he realizes something is wrong as he smells smoke and the house looks ransacked. Was it a struggle or was it something else that caused Amy's disappearance as the next step in the chain of events is calling the Police. This would change the complexion of his life.<br /><br />Thealternating voices of both Nick and Amy change throughout the first part of the novel as Amy enlightens the reader in her diary entries as to the changes she feels she sees not only in herself but in Nick that cause their marriage to deteriorate. Added in is the fact that Amy has never had to worry about money for any reason yet her parents come to her and borrow a substantial amount because of poor financial choices. Resentment hits an all time high as Nick and Amy are constantly arguing over money, his loss of his job and then the reader becomes aware of his infidelity in the present. Questioned by the police, seemingly upset about her disappearance and clues provided by Amy to help him find her it is almost like her typical treasure hunts she enjoys creating. Gone Girl has many levels to it as we begin to realize that Amy is not only gone or has orchestrated her own disappearance and is now living what she would call a double life, but her mind seems to be going deeper into another mindset as Kevin seems to finding his way in other places. Just where will this all lead still remains to be seen as we hear Amy's thoughts, ramblings and words in part two of this book stating she is glad to be gone and missing. According to her parents and most friends she was kind, sweet, adorable and the subject of their many books so how does she turn into something so different. Almost like a split personality and another coming through in part two pumping up the plot for her unusual return in Part three. Why would Amy create her own disappearance and try to pin it on Kevin? Just how diabolical is she to create and orchestrate this entire event to coincide with her anniversary?<br /><br />Although he agrees to the questioning by the police you can tell that both sides have a strong undertone of suspicion as to what might have happened to Amy. But, if you take a closer look you will learn that she is conniving, manipulative and cunning because she orchestrated the entire event sothat Nick would be the prime suspect in what she will make appear as her murder. Amy documents in her diary entries her changing perspective of Nick from the first moments when she thought her world was filled with all of the things she wanted and needed because of him and then changed when she tells about his jealousies, his insecurities and resentment of her wealth and parental help. But, things shift when her parents make a poor financial choice and Amy has to lend them back the money in her trust fund that was originally theirs. Gone Girl has more a deeper meaning than just the disappearance of this young girl. As you listen closely and hear her voice, read each diary entry you will get to know her inner most thoughts, feelings, expressions and truths that are revealed as the author leads us into part two where things change.<br /><br />The police are on the scene but have not really investigated every lead or every angle. At points you seem to think they are waiting for Nick to lead them to Amy or for him to solve the case for them. Each date in her diary brings us to the day of her disappearance where she made sure the police would find her blood and Nick the many written clues that she hoped would enlighten him to where she might be and what she has done. But, will he figure it out before the police? Will he realize what she did? These clues as he puts it are Amy's treasure hunt clues leading to a path you just won't believe.<br /><br />Her plan was to fake her disappearance and frame him for her murder as Nick reveals in part two. Little does he know that Amy saw him and another woman in his place called The Bar. How naïve of him to think he'd get away with it. In her own words using the title of her parent's book he had single-handedly de-amazed Amazing Amy. Just how would she make herself Dead Amy? Just how she stockpiled money is quite ingenious and what her plan is devious to say the least. Added in she is in a hideout and finds out she is pregnant butshe has met so many different people where she is hiding and her mind seems to have snapped as she shares her plans with others and hears what they really think of her. Then more comes out about Amy as false charges are stated not only against Nick but someone else saying he raped Amy. Added in someone else enlightens him about more. So, Amy goes one step further not to be found and calls the tip line sending them in the wrong direction. Nick's heartfelt confession played all over the air. As Amy turns to an old friend for comfort and help and we move to part three where all elements of surprise are no longer there and she returns. Just how she returns and Nick's reaction you might be startled and surprised to learn. Sharon Schieber will interview you on television, reporters, blogs and tons of publicity just to frame him for her murder. So, why does she decide to return. Why not stay missing? The clues are simple: Pictures Amy, Nick, Andie, pregnancy tests and unpaid bills. She set him up perfectly. So, after the interview why does she decide to return? Gone Girl: 40 days gone and what happens next he's arrested? Then he finds her on his doorstep looking like she was beaten. But, was she and why take her in? What really happened between her and Desi? What will the police learn when the see him? What did she do? Will she get away with murder? The ending will come as a definite surprise and the final outcome will not be what you might expect. Why does everyone believe her word? Why didn't the police realize that she's a psychopath and needs help? Just how does she frame Nick? What does he decide to do?<br /><br />Gone Girl has many characters that add color to the plot. The group she hides out with, the police, Go, his straightforward sister, and her parents who lead the way for the reader to know that they along with Amy are superficial. Reporters that are hungry for a story. Police detectives that need retraining.<br />This is one marriage that will make you thinkabout the definitions of dysfunctional, psychotic and revengeful. Why do these two feel that they owe each other anything? Why does Nick think he failed? Why does Amy feel entitled?<br /><br />Author Gillian Flynn brings to light many issues that some face today as we learn about deceit, betrayals, distrusts, greed, hate and one woman who felt that she wanted it all but went about it in a unique and dangerous way. Gone Girl not just physically but in more ways than one. This is one novel that will definitely keep you thinking and make you wonder if the author added one more chapter what would be in store for Nick next?
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|Surprisingly fun. Emma Roberts never disappoints me. Warm hearted story of a teenage boy who thinks his life is so bad (what else is new) until he seeks help for his depression and unknowingly commits himself for an an extended period of time and befriends other patients with \\"real life\\" issues. Light, touching and great character performances.

B005LAIHSG|2.0|The only thing that is enjoyable about this movie is Charlize Theron.  Obviously, the story is not going to be a surprise, so it has to be the acting that makes it interesting and she's the only one who seems to have put any effort into this.  She's over the top at times but mostly, she makes a pretty good evil queen.  I was even a little inclined to be a little sympathetic towards her character during the wedding scene when Snow White stole her thunder - every bride wants to be the center of attention on her wedding day.<br />I like Chris Hemsworth.  He's eye candy, but also a fairly decent actor, so he's enjoyable to watch.  But in this he looked like one of the Geico cavemen - how did they manage to do that to Thor, for pete's sake?  So distracting, I couldn't take him seriously.<br />And then there's Kristen Stewart, who can't act for toffee and who has such an unexpressive face that she mostly just pouts her way through the movies she's in.  The scene at the beginning of the big battle finale?  Up rides the huntsman (the love of her life, we have just discovered, no Prince Charming here) and she winces at him.  She's supposed to be bursting with joy, overflowing with love and gratitude that he is there, they will face this together, all will be well if you are with me - you get the idea - and she manages to look like the laxative has just kicked in.<br />She's the female version of Tom Cruise - wooden acting, no depth to their performances, couldn't act their way out of a paper bag ... and yet Hollywood loves them.  I don't get it.<br />The rest was pretty much forgettable - I watched this a couple of weeks ago and truly can't remember anything else good or bad.

B0013FXWU6|5.0|I didn't move during the whole film totally immersed in the story.<br /><br />Both Daniel Plainview and Ely Sunday are on the same side of a misanthropic coin despising most fellow humans. Both are fundamentally focused on the attainment of power,glory and wealth, which to varying degrees each achieves. Both are tenacious and single minded, but Daniel Plainview, is totally twisted by his \\"misanthropy\\" heightened by alcohol and the whining Ely Sunday, to deliberately and completely destroy whom he dispises.  Ely Sunday doesn't rise or delve to that level. Daniel Plainview with the past experience of murderous rage and righteous fury is indeed \\"finished\\"  -  finished with his dinner, finished with his booze, finished with Ely Sunday, finished with H.W. and finished with his life.<br />All that was good in Daniel Plainview was represented by his attachment and love for the young H.W., even while using him for his own ends, but that love brooked no independance, no self other than Daniel Plainview's self.<br />Daniel Plainview by the end of the film has become a \\"monster of revelation\\".

0061655554|5.0|This was my second time through one of Wall Street's most amazing stories. It's depiction of the Leveraged Buyout craze of the 1980's is a cautionary tale of greed that remains unheeded. An LBO is a financial transaction and process by which \\"a small group of senior executives, usually working with a Wall Street partner, proposes to buy its company from public shareholders, using massive amounts of borrowed money\\". Colorful Ross Johnson from my hometown of Winnipeg headed RJR Nabisco and recklessly sought to unlock the value he believed investors were overlooking in the company. This organization was the 19th largest company at the time with 140,000 employees and a host of impressive brands: Oreos, Ritz crackers, Life Savers, and Winston and Salem cigarettes. The eventual transaction ended up being the largest LBO ever reaching $17 billion in value (and huge heights of controversy).<br /><br />Johnson could be a fictional invention. His rise in corporate power was built on political manoeuvring, extensive expense accounts, fleets of corporate jets (RJR Nabsico had 36 pilots and 10 planes), hobnobbing, and other excesses that make for entertaining (and these days incomprehensible) reading. His desire to eschew corporate tradition and civility is at odds with a traditional, depression upbringing. But Ross was his own man and showed early signs of being an entrepreneur and dealmaker. He was also big on the social scene being president of his fraternity, varsity basketball player, and a Cadet in Canadian military officer training at the University of Manitoba. The book is replete with examples of Ross' love of partying and the good life. At one time he was a member of over twenty country clubs and always seemed able to hit the links no matter what was going on.<br /><br />The book reintroduces us to the firms and players that would personify a time when financial black magic took precedent over business basics like valuable products and solid customer service (not much has changed). In it are: Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis; Salomon Brothers; Jim and Linda Robinson; Lazard Freres & Co.; Jeffrey \\"Mad Dog\\" Beck; Morgan Stanley; Drexel Burnham Lambert; Forstmann Little; Goldman Sachs; Shearson Lehman; and more. The majority of the book covers the feeding frenzy that ensued once the company was in play. Greed, petty jealousies, tantrums, egos, arrogance and ignorance are all in great supply. I enjoyed the side stories covering Ted Forstmann who hated Kohlberg Kravis and John Greeniaus who was one executive capable of actual management.<br /><br />Burrough and Helyar place the reader in the boardroom, limo, and bar. The book is so well researched, the narrative so engaging, and the pace so lively that it reads like a novel. It continues to influence financial and business reporting by placing emphasis on the very real human foibles that impact those worlds. It made me a bit of a junkie for similar works as I went on to read others of this genre and era including: Den of Thieves, Predator's Ball, Rainmaker, amongst others.has changed).

B005LAII08|1.0|Why do studios insist that, in order to get some movies (especially kids' movies) on Blu-Ray, we must also purchase a DVD, Digital disc copy, and now a 3D Blu-ray? I don't need any of those extra discs, can't even USE one of them. I just want to get the movie in BD format, plain and simple. I don't mind the 5-disc Ultimate Edition's existence, I would just rather that it be a Special Edition, for die-hard collectors only.<br /><br />As DVD is slowly getting phased out of the market, let's shift the reach of the single-disc option from the lower-quality DVD to the now-standard Blu-Ray format.<br /><br />EDIT/Correction: There IS a 3-disc edition which contains only the Blu-Ray and DVD edition of the movie, for those of us who don't want/need the BD 3D or Digital formats. It simply doesn't show up here at Amazon when browsing the DVD or 5-Disc BD editions for some reason. The edition is here, for those looking for this edition: [[ASIN:B005LAIHZY Brave (Three-Disc Collector's Edition: Blu-ray / DVD)]]

B0099G3I96|2.0|This band has completely lost its soul.  They've lost their much-ness.  Nothing here sounds the slightest bit like No Doubt -- just the overly-nasal vocals of the femme fatale...and pop music has plenty of those.  I'm gonna pass on this one... and it breaks my heart to say it.  I hope they find their way again.
B008RYN44U|1.0|...because this one is not good. Please don't go out like this, No Doubt. I agree with the reviewers saying the music doesn't rock out and it sounds like contemporary pop. The worst, though, is that it has no emotion. There is nothing to connect to in the lyrics and the music is electronic noise. The only positive thing I can say about this album is the hype inspired me to listen to their older stuff again.<br /><br />There are probably some younger fans out there that think Gwen Stefani and No Doubt are the same thing.  If you're one of them, ignore me. You'll like this.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|I really enjoyed The L Word even years after it ended. Relationship high and lows with good storytelling is what this is all about. The characters are believable and strong women.
0385344228|4.0|*** SPOILER ALERT *** I think the very thing that infuriates people about this book is what makes it so good. The narrator is entirely unreliable. At the beginning, before the story unfolds, you get the feeling that Jacob is entirely innocent, wrongly accused, etc. Then details start coming out... And not even details that you could easily brush off such as evidence that could have a reasonable explanation. Things like a knife matching the murder weapon, torture pornography, animal killing, cruelty, and most significantly, disturbing diagnoses from a psychiatrist. I think the \\"murder gene\\" story line is a bit overplayed as it was essentially a non-issue and merely served as a plot device to create a murderous family history. I did not mind Andy's unreliability; however, I found it a little perplexing that someone so terrified of his family history would completely bury his head in the sand about his son's murderous tendencies. That said, given some parent's ability to completely believe the best of their children to a fault, and the fact that maybe someone with such an overwhelming urge to kill is also very smart about not giving any indication of the same, it was believable. I did not find myself invested in the characters, even though I very much enjoyed the book and read it over an evening and morning. I think the book might have benefitted from more interaction with Andy's dad as he was an intriguing character that was very underdeveloped, and again, felt like merely a plot device. I do not think that the spelling out of what happened to Patz was necessary. I could have believed that it was maybe Jacob who killed him. The ending was definitely a nice twist (though once the trial had wrapped up, and the story kept going, it was foreseeable), but it felt rushed. I can completely understand Laurie killing Jacob after she realized that he was clearly ill and would never stop having a compulsion to kill (but rather would just get better at it), but it was stuffed into a few pages. It might have been nice if the last few pages/last chapters were from Jacob or Laurie's perspective to add a different interpretation. Overall, it was a good book, and I enjoyed it.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I am a absolute Sherlock Holmes fan. When seeing this series offered & for the price it was a no-brainer for me. The books have NOT disappointed. I am enjoying each & every one. thanQ Amazon!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|That's about all I came away with after finishing this. I FINALLY decided to read it, after being countless times have I read it. Even my physical therapist asked me had I read it in the middle of massaging my back. \\"It'll change your sex life,\\" she said. No, no this isn't awkward at all. Anyways, the concept was very interesting, just poorly executed. I've never met someone who bites their lip at the most inconceivable times! The level of under-developed characters made this pretty hard to get through. I found myself skipping through, just to hurry and be done. And the sex scenes? They were not, \\"oh my gosh this is going to change my sex life with my husband\\" in the least bit! If it's changing sex lives, and hopefully keeping couples together, I'm all for it. But, don't act like this is a groundbreaking work of art. Because that it is not. It's mediocre erotic fiction, and there are so many better authors out there in this genre people should try!

B008Y2FRFO|3.0|if you like coin games you'll enjoy this game but since you have to wait forever to regenerate coins (unless you leave the game on forever then you get one every thirty seconds) then you'll be waiting forever to refill your coins because offline it takes every 9 minutes to get one coin. would be better if the developers gave more coins faster.

Marc Bolan redefined innovation and creativity, even alongside contemporaries Zeppelin, Hendrix, Floyd, Roxy Music, Yes, and \\"peers\\" (by name only) in the Glam Rock genre.  His unique influence in look (\\"cork screw hair\\" black high hat ala Linda Perry and Slash), haunting overlaid guitar whines screamed through pulsating Vampower amp tubes, driving background drum rhythms, and a unlimited voice range of like an electric harmonica synthesizer.  I also ordered the Electric Warrior CD to hear for the first time and am instantly addicted.  Each CD represent perfectly matched collections without a bad cut on either.  Mine just play all the way through over and over.

B006H5120E|5.0|If you are like me, you probably own the 2005 3 Disc Collector's Edition which includes the deleted scenes. Recently there were 3 releases of Titanic, one in just DVD format with no extras, a Bluray/DVD Digital Copy combo and a 3D/2D Bluray/Digital Copy combo. Unless you are an ardent fan like me of which this is a must have, then you are probably wondering if its worth the upgrade.<br /><br />Well, when it comes to special features, there are two featurettes that look back on the legacy of Titanic everything else is from the 3 Disc collector's edition. These aren't featurettes that are like 10 minutes long. They are actually about 90 minutes long each. So you will have to decide how important these two extra features are in comparison to the 3 Disc set.<br /><br />Now as for the movies themselves:<br /><br />3D<br />Having saw Titanic 3D in theaters, I can safely say that the 3D presentation looked wonderful on my 32 inch Vizio 3DTV. The 3D makes you feel like you are part of the movie. James Cameron does not use any 3D gimmicks such as during the sinking water doesn't seem like its coming at you, instead it just makes you feel like you are on the ship. The 3D effects brings the background into formation and things you never really notice before become noticeable which is good.<br /><br />Like the DVD though, the 3D movie is split on to 2 discs.<br /><br />2D<br />Owning the 2005 DVD, I decided to compare the 2D bluray to the DVD and can definitely say that there is a quality difference. The Bluray looks much more crisp and makes the grand Titanic look far more grander.<br /><br />As for the audio, I did notice on my old Magnavox blu ray player and Emerson 32 inch TV that the special effects were great but whenever people talked, it was bad. If you tried to turn it up, it made the special effects louder but the rest of the audio did not improve in the least. On my Sony 3D Blu ray player as well as on my Vizio 3DTV the 2D blu ray audio is vastly different. Maybe itsthe HD StudioSurround and TruSurround on my TV, but the audio is far better than it was on my old player and TV.<br /><br />As for the menu, I haven't seen the new DVD's approach but I can say that I much prefer the menu style of the 3D/2D blu rays over my 2005 DVD.<br /><br />All in all, its a great combo set. I'll still be keeping my 2005 DVD set even if it is moot. But as to the question of upgrading, I think it is definitely worth doing. If you own the DVD, go for the 3D/2D Blu ray set as you never know if you'll need 3D and there is no point in owning double copies in the same format. If you don't own Titanic at all, then you must weigh the option of having DVD or 3D Blu ray.
B0099G3I96|5.0|This is coming from someone who has NEVER bought a No Doubt CD. I've always liked them, but I was never a big fan and I decided to give them a try. So I bought the CD last week and I'm telling you, it's great! I cannot stop listening to them. No Doubt has really changed how I feel about them and I hope they continue to come out with music.<br /><br />It's a great buy, and you will enjoy it.
B007FG9LIE|1.0|I got suckered into reading this book after seeing that the author was inspired by his love for Twin Peaks.  I was revisiting that series on DVD when I saw this book on Amazon, and I let that influence my decision to check out this book.  What a poor choice that turned out to be...<br /><br />This book is horrible from beginning to end.  It's not exciting.  It's not scary.  It's full of characters that you're not going to care about.  And, as if it weren't punishment enough to suffer through the build up of the story, it lets you down even further with a completely stupid twist at the end.  Maybe that was an attempt to make something interesting out of a totally bland story, but it fails miserably and ruins the book's last chance at having a single redeeming quality.  This book might appeal to elementary school children, but that's only because they don't know any better.<br /><br />I almost feel bad trashing the author's work after reading his afterword, wherein he talks about his inspiration for writing the book and a little bit about the process of getting the book made, but I feel it's my duty to warn people.  I took a chance on the Kindle version since it was fairly inexpensive and I had never read anything by this author before.  I will not be reading any more of his books.  I encourage you not to waste your money the way I did.  Even if you have Amazon Prime and are able to borrow this book for free, DON'T DO IT!

B003AO1SVS|5.0|Ok here's the deal : been a BK fan for many years, hated Attack & Release, loved this. Seriously. People are saying \\"you're either pre-Danger Mouse or post-Danger Mouse,\\" I'm sorta both and neither. Before Attack & Release it was mostly good & raw old-fashioned blues for the modern era. Attack & Release didn't have a blues feel, and I kinda like Danger Mouse, so I was a little disappointed. When Brothers came out I thought, \\"sure, I'll give them another try.\\" Blown away. They're back to the good blues, but it's more refined & produced - it's not as raw as it was in the Rubber Factory days and that's ok. I honestly think this is one of the best blues albums I've ever heard. GO GET IT!

This review is about the five combo blu-ray package.<br /><br />Extras / Behind the scenes:<br /><br />The extras in this package are decent. If you watch all of them they will keep you distracted for quite a while.  The deleted scenes are fun but in the end you know why they ended up being deleted. There are a couple of exceptions.<br /><br />DVD:<br /><br />This is a nice to have but not a need to have.  This is a nice addition if you have a friend you want to lend this movie too.<br /><br />Blu-Ray:<br /><br />The quality of this blu-ray is not notch.  Sometimes you'll get a blu-ray that just doesn't seem right.  The picture quality might be off or the sound isn't what you would expect.  This one lives up to Disney Standards it's the best you can get.<br /><br />Blu-Ray 3D:<br /><br />I guess this is nice to have but i don't have 3D TV so I can't eally comment on it.<br /><br />Digital Copy:<br /><br />What can I say...AWESOME!  I say this because Disney acctually gives you a digital copy!  A real copy you can put into iTunes or your other media server.  This is not that horrific piece of trash known as \\"Ultra Violet\\" that some other studios give you.  Thank you Disney for not going that route.<br /><br />Sound Track:<br /><br />This is another thing Disney has been doing lately.  The Muppets Blu-Ray also did this.  You can download the sound track for free.  In most cases these are not songs I would have bought but this is a nice touch.  It really ends up adding value to the whole package.<br /><br />Comic Book:<br /><br />You get a free digital avengers comic book. That's not too shaby.<br /><br />Poster:<br /><br />You can also get an Avengers poster at no charge.  It's not that nice but it's still a nice overall addition.<br /><br />Packaging:<br /><br />This is the only hit or miss part of this package.  The hologram on the front is cool even if it makes your eyes hurt.  The part that isn't cool is how the dics are found.  Most of the time each dics has it's own snap in.  In this package the DVD and digital copy are stacked on top of each other (on the same snap) and the Blu-Ray and 3D are stacked on top of each other.  That just seems kind of cheap.<br /><br />Price:<br /><br />Right now you can get this for 19.99. WOW! If a family of four went to see this in the moives you paid a lot more than that.

B00846TTDG|5.0|Having worked in the special ops environment for 24 years, I have a deep respect for the operators.  I get their outlook on live and the drive to get the mission done.  To me the acting was more genuine than the \\"professional\\" Hollywood actors.  Most are just not convincing that they have physical skills.  I find that I am not watching many of the recent movies.  I realize they are not making documentaries, that they hope to entertain for profit.  I find it unconvincing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this book captivated me from the beginning! it has everything i look for in a book and i couldnt put it down. i would reccomend it to anyone who wants a good cry and a book that sticks with you.
0062086529|5.0|This book is very stimulating to my 7 month old. The older he gets, the more he's enjoying it! Very creative, cute story.
030758836X|5.0|Fabulous...I thought it was going in one direct, then half way through I thought another direction...andthe ending you WILL NEVER GUESS. Great read...sent on to My Momma to read next...
B008TRUDAS|4.0|A very good read for women or better yet young women. The writer has an innovative mind.The book is a tear-jerker too so have a box of kleenex handy. You will really like the characters despite their troubles.<br /><br />I'd never heard of slamming before. Is it an established form of poetry or did she create it for this book? Either way it serves as a great thread to tie the story lines together and it's an interesting form of expression.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I watched the movie first and wish I'd read the book first! It's so much more informative. I really enjoyed the entire series.
B0018AT7DW|2.0|The music is classic great Grateful Dead, but I cannot properly review it because the last few minutes of several songs just drop out.  Amazon has technical problems with MP3 downloads to I-Tunes which they refuse to correct, so I'm using this forum to call attention to it.  If you are an Apple I-Tunes user beware Amazon MP3s.
B009329Y30|2.0|I had high hopes for this film since the book was so great, but it was a let-down. The directing was sloppy; there were too many poor transitions. Not to mention that Zeus, the dog, disappears at the end of the film and never reappears again. How do you forget to include the dog in the ending? The chemistry between the two main characters wasn't great, and neither was Zac Efron's acting, although I know he's capable because I've seen him act well before. This leads me to question again whether it was just the poor directing, and not necessarily Efron's poor acting abilities.<br /><br />I feel like directors sometimes view Nicholas Sparks's stories as a guarantee for instant box-office success (and understandably so, since most of his novels are terrific), however in doing so they fail to actually put in a solid effort when creating the film, which is a shame because the story-lines have such potential.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Watched the Complete First Season while on vacation for 3 weeks traveling in the motor home. There were a couple I missed and I am now ready for the New Season and feel totally caught up.  It was great to be able to review it all again! Will definitely be watched many times from beginning to end over the next few years-right up there on my favorites with the 10th Kingdom which I have watched every year since the movie came out.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I was definitely intrigued by this book, and found it hard to put down. Plenty of suspense and thrills to hold your attention.
B008BM9L72|4.0|I felt the need to read this series simply to see what all the hype was over. Although I am still uncertain, I did enjoy the story. However, I did not like the ending. It was a strong ending for a chapter, not a book. But if the author did this on purpose (which I am sure she did) just to get me to read the next book in the series - it worked. Luckily the next book was available otherwise I would have been peeved if made to wait. Ultimately I would have lost interest and not read the others.<br />I enjoyed the second and third book in this series more than the first. Unfortunately though, the female protagonist continued to annoy me with her ignorance and lack of consideration to Christian's (Male protagonist) feelings, in a relationship she ultimately agreed to. Did I approve of his idea of a relationship? NO! But hey, it made for interesting reading, its not real life after all and I am a sucker for a strong, overprotective, overbearing male in a love story. A good Romance story is all about the escapism from reality after all.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. I play it every day when I get home before. I go to bed it just a fun game to play so get it and play.
B007THA4FI|1.0|When I pay more the $10.00 for a book it had better be a Hardcopy GREAT WORLD CHANGING book, School Text book, or the Bible. Never an electronic book.<br />I just finished and deleted the Kindle Free Sample. It did not entice me to purchase this book. I would not read this book for any price. The best-developed character was dead in two pages. The other characters are shallow, petty and immature, (just like normal people). I read to escape from my reality not enter another shallow similarity. There were too many characters introduced in too few pages, to many to keep straight. This might be an OK book but not a good read.
B0028R3NCU|4.0|The smallest microSD reader. There are other ones that could hide itself into USB port, but they won't go in your wallet like this one does.<br />Liked it very much. The only problem is if you use it for a rather extended time, like 15mins, it gets hot. But since I use it mainly to exchange files, it's not a big problem. Once worried if it will overheat and die, but at least until now no sign of it.
B0064GKEXC|5.0|No doubt Horowitz was one of the incredible artists of all times. It is our luck that technology permits us to see and hear him. If we only could see or at least hear Liszt!!!
0307592731|2.0|The narrator of this book was so unhinged, so RIDICULOUS, it was all I could do to keep reading. She falls completely into mental illness, because her mother dies quickly and relatively easily from a fast-acting cancer. Look, losing a parent is no picnic, I'm sure but...isn't it a right of passage for most of us? It's not like we don't ALL have most of our lives to get cozy with the fact that (hopefully) we will outlive our parents. And yet she lets this sad event completely destroy her life. Heroin abuse, sexual addiction, ruining what she describes as a wonderful marriage to the most supportive husband ever. Failing to graduate from college because she couldn't bring herself to write one five page paper due to the untimely demise of her mom - that actually made me throw the book against the wall. What a spoiled, self-entitled, obnoxious jerk. Seriously people, FOUR YEARS after the death of her parent, she is still moaning and self-destructing over it. I wonder how she would have reacted if her mother had lingered longer than a month? Doesn't bear thinking about.<br /><br />But all of that pales in comparison to how completely unprepared she was for the PCT. Totally embarrassingly unprepared. She never even considered the weight of her pack when selecting gear, along with a laundry list of about a million other things she didn't think about. It all just made me wince with how idiotic she sounded. By her own account, she went to college. She was too silly to pull it together long enough to actually graduate but she did matriculate somewhere. All I can think is that she actually just wanted the trail to kill her so she could be put out of her misery.<br /><br />Finally we have the complete non-sequiturs in her writing. Like, when she talks about her mother's male nurse and his penis. What? It made no sense.<br /><br />This book was supposed to be about self-discovery and healing. NONE of that actually took place. While on the trail she continues hooking up with random men - if anything, her usual low standards sink even further because no one would have showered in the week leading up to the assignation. She still manages to find drugs.<br /><br />This book makes me feel embarrassed for women everywhere. Seriously, between this and flipping 50 Shades of Gray, we might as well just throw in the towel now.<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD: I revisited the book and reread the last three chapters which were actually pretty enjoyable. If I hadn't grown to dislike the narrator earlier in the book, I would have liked the end. Her personal growth came a little too late for me to enjoy fully in context with the rest of the book.
0375842209|5.0|This is an incredibly original story although I didn't love every page of the book the way so many did. In fact there were times were it was moving much too slowly for my liking. That said, the narration by Death was one of the most profound, thought-provoking, life changing aspects of the book for me. Some of \\"his\\" most significant passages come at the end so I am so glad I stuck with it. The imagery is beautiful and comforting for anyone who has lost a loved one or fears their own death.
B007THA4FI|5.0|If you do not like the Kindle price, buy the hardcover copy.  Only a few dollars more for something concrete which may make you feel its worth despite its worth in literary sweat, creativity, & execution.<br /><br />I am a longtime Kindle owner & I'm going to purchase the hardcover version to tickle my fancy.

B000002LK1|5.0|Depeche Mode, Violator, 200 of 233 reviews on Amazon with 5 stars...That says it all. Oops, make that 201 of 234 reviews.<br /><br />9 songs, all individually powerful and Depeche Mode's greatest work from 1989/90. This CD is 100% all high points without any flaws at all. It's perfect!<br /><br />Dramatic at times, dark and moody then uplifting, rising from the depths all within the space of a single song. Timeless classic after classic is what was written and produced on this CD.<br /><br />There are so many churning or pounding bass lines running through each song. The vocals can be very haunting and seductive. Flawless electronics and grab you by the throat funky beats.<br /><br />I'm more of a blues and classic rock buff but I had to cross into this genre of music to give my twist on this benchmark performance. Depeche Mode has raised the bar with this one. The music has reached a diverse audience out there and is essentially a very satisfying CD. This is musical intelligence at its best.
B00846REIS|4.0|I first read Silvia Day's novella, Taking the Heat, from the, Men Out of Uniform Anthology. I loved that story. So I decided that I would try a different book and see how it went. I picked Bared to You. I'm not much for anxious books. And that's why I gave only 4stars instead of 5.<br /><br />The book is done through 1st person POV so I think it's slightly unfair. We have Eva who's been abused in her life and Gideon who's practically mirrored her life. They both have destructive tendencies and both love to push the people they care about away from them. It's evident in both of their manic behavior. We have Eva, who doesn't think she's worthy of having anyone like Gideon, so she yells and pitches fits and acts like she a child. Then there is Gideon, who at least acknowledges he makes mistakes, but also has that penchant to pitch a fit when he doesn't get what he wants.<br /><br />There is also this faux trust between them. They want to trust each other so bad, but in the end it's not there. She can't stand the women in his life, he has to know where she is and everything she does. It's not healthy, but I guess that's the point of the book.<br /><br />A couple of times I wanted to slap them both and say stop. Look at yourselves. But again this is the book. It begs the question, can two people so damage make a relationship work, or last? My answer, I don't know. They are their own worst enemies, but also their salvations.<br /><br />Maybe this would have been better done in 3rd person POV. Maybe if we could see how Gideon feels instead of reading it through Eva's eyes, we'd get a better connection between the two, but that's just my opinion.<br /><br />Overall though, even with anxiety, I liked the book. I think it was very well written. I liked the characters even though they're damaged. I also can't wait for the next book, Reflected in You. I want to see how these two characters grow and change.<br /><br />I just wish the characters weren't so self-destructive.
B001RZC4VA|5.0|No other band sounds quite like Morphine.<br /><br />Morphine is:<br /><br />Mark Sandman...2-string slide bass; tritar; guitar; organ; lead vocals.<br />Dana Colley...baritone saxophone; tenor saxophone; backing vocals.<br />Jerome Deupree...drums.<br />Billy Conway...drums on #'s 9 & 11; cocktail drum overdub on # 8.<br />Jimmy Ryan...Mandolin on # 7<br />Ken Winokur...Percussion on # 13<br /><br />Music at its coolest from the 90's, this band does it all without the wall of sound that a lead guitar provides. Just smooth, intriguing, and consistent alternative rock and roll.<br /><br />\\"The band themselves coined the label \\"low rock\\" to describe their music, which involved \\"a minimalist, low-end sound that could have easily become a gimmick.\\"<br /><br />These guys creep up on you and lull you into captivity with their hypnotic bass and saxophone lines. Bluesy jazz riffs and top shelf lyrics. Sexy, chilling out music.<br /><br />\\"While their music is a joy to listen to, the joy feels more like a deep admiration of technique rather than a passionate and personal emotional connection.\\"<br /><br />This is a cult band at its best. Sandman died of a heart attack on stage at the age of 47 and then the band disbanded in 1999 but not before he left a permanent imprint as one of the most distinctive musicians of his generation.

B005S9EJ46|4.0|The 411 by Maria: I was excited to see this movie oddly because I love the title and with all those veteran actors things could be interesting. As a reviewer you just never know what you are going to get. My expectations are never high and I love being pleasantly surprised.  This movie surprised me!<br /><br />Storyline by Maria We meet all of our players at the beginning and find out why all these people will be heading to India to live out their golden years. Whether it is because they are newly widowed, looking for something new, receiving a hip replacement or a slew of other reasons they all meet at the airport and our story begins..<br /><br />The hotel isn't quite what they expected and is run by a young entrepreneur named Sonny played by Dev Patel. Sonny has a vision and explains to his mother that he is \\"outsourcing old age\\" because \\"there are many countries where they don't like old people\\".<br /><br />My favorite quote from the movie comes from Sonny who is always optimistic; \\"Everything will always be alright in the end and if it is not alright than trust me, it is not yet the end.\\"<br /><br />Actors: Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson are wonderful! Judi Dench as Evelyn the widowing who is trying to find herself, gets a job and enjoys the beauty around her. Loved her character. Oh and Maggie Smith as the prejudice Muriel, is one feisty spitfire.<br /><br />Location: I loved it! From overcrowded buses, rickshaws, mopeds, and colorful clothing and buildings. The landscape is another character adding to the beauty of the movie. See this movie and be surprised!

B007KDFWRG|4.0|I'll be honest - I bought this CD because of Susan Tedeschi.  It's not that the Trucks band isn't good, because they are.  It's just that Tedeschi's voice stands head and shoulders above the other musicians.  Some of the tunes are a bit too \\"metallic\\" for my taste, but altogether, it's a great album.
B008OHV5C8|5.0|No disappointments here. Another great album from the trio. Every track is excellent except, perhaps, track 5.<br /><br />Keep the albums coming, guys!
B009B50QOU|5.0|Green Day keep it simple on \\"!UNO!\\" - simple lyrics, simple chords.  It's sometimes sweet, sometimes angry, but unlike their last two albums, never political. \\"!UNO!\\" is one of the most energetic albums I've heard in a long time. The energy literally never stops.  There are no ballads. Every track is fast and features heavy guitars and drums.<br /><br />The album leans more to power-pop than real punk rock.  If you're looking for raw punk energy and production, you'll be disappointed.  But if you're looking for songs that are loud, yet melodic and polished, you've come to the right place. And it's above average power-pop.<br /><br />Some have said that the album revives the band's sound during the 90s or early 00s. That's true to an extent. \\"!Uno!\\" has more in common with \\"Warning\\" than \\"21st Century Breakdown\\".  However, this album is less angsty and bratty than their earlier work. They're acclaimed rock stars after all, not youngsters.<br /><br />It is their most lighthearted album to date.  The power-pop of \\"Oh Love\\" (the first single) is the most sugary sweet I've heard Green Day.  The dance-pop-punk of \\"Kill The DJ\\" is a rare party song for the band. \\"Let Yourself Go\\", however, is where the band shows their angry side.  This track echoes the \\"Insomniac\\" era the most.  \\"Nuclear Family\\" also echoes \\"Insomniac\\".  \\"Stay The Night\\" is another lighthearted power-pop track.<br /><br />My favorite Green Day albums are \\"Dookie\\" and \\"American Idiot\\". The rest of the Green Day albums are also great, and \\"!UNO!\\" ranks as good as them.

0451232577|5.0|Ken Follet has done it again. The story of five families surrounding events leading up to World War I is compelling and historically accurate. The character development leads the reader to a feeling of relationship with character, whether emphathy or loathing. Eight hundred plus pages was so easy to read. I could not put down the novel. The revelations of how people lived, behaved, thought, felt, and reacted to conditions in pre-war England is spell binding. I cannot wait to begin reading \\"Winter of the World.\\"

0374214913|5.0|Clay Jannon is an out-of-work graphic designer when he comes across Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore in the Broadway porn gulch in San Francisco.  In short order, Clay is hired for the 10pm-to-6am shift.  It's hard to figure out why the bookstore is open at all, let alone 24 hours, since customers are extremely infrequent--and quite bizarre.  There are only a few books for sale on the floor.  The real bookstore seems to be what Clay calls the Waybacklist; a collection of unique, leather-bound titles in the back, shelved to an absolutely dizzying height.  And when I say unique, I mean it.  Clay can't find any of these titles listed in any catalog.  They can't be purchased; only borrowed by the strange members of a club, who always know exactly what title they want next when they return a book.<br /><br />With so few bookstore customers to distract him, Clay can't help investigating the meaning of the Waybacklist and its mysterious patrons.  He soon recruits a league of friends to help in his quest, including new girlfriend Kat, from Google, his roommate Mat, who works at Industrial Light and Magic, startup multi-millionaire Neel, and several others.  The conjunction of the team's ultra-modern technological resources with the dusty arcana of the Waybacklist, full of old knowledge--or OK, as Kat says it is known at Google--is one of the most fascinating aspects of the book.<br /><br />The quest takes us from San Francisco to the Google campus (described in entertaining detail, especially the caf&eacute;), the headquarters of a secret society in New York, a knitting museum in the East Bay, and a museum warehouse in Nevada.  We learn a lot of fascinating details about programming languages, the history of type fonts and printing, and attacking data-intensive problems by distributing them across huge numbers of machines and people.  There is whole lot going on in this relatively short book, but author Sloan never loses control of his story.  It's always about the people and, in short, the meaning of life.<br /><br />Funny, suspenseful and heartwarming, this is an adventure story that celebrates both Old Knowledge and modern technology.  Highly recommended.short, the meaning of life.<br /><br />Funny, suspenseful and heartwarming, this is an adventure story that celebrates both Old Knowledge and modern technology.

0385120508|3.0|Perhaps it is a matter of \\"familiarity breeds contempt\\" since I have read this book several times.  It has been a number of years so I just read it again.  The story is pretty good.  Emma is a little unbelievable but it is an entertaining family story.  The actual use of the language is pathetic.  There are many run-on sentences that could have been simplified (I know it might be a literary device but it also might not be since there are so many)  I read it wondering if it was an early book, if she had a bad editor or what?  She constantly uses \\"ness\\" as a suffix, practically inventing new words.  \\"austereness\\" comes to mind.  The really bad mistake was when she referred to a male/female set of twins as identical.  That doesn't happen.  She did a good job of character development in the beginning then lapsed into telling us the story instead of showing us the story.  Years went by with a single paragraph towards the end.  Good idea.  Pretty good story.  Terrible editing.  I knocked off a star for editing.
B008RYN44U|4.0|I want to start this review off by saying that this isn't the best album that No Doubt has ever created, but it's not a bad album as some would suggest. I won't sit here and give it 5 star praise, because there are a couple of songs on here I could care less about and even some laughable lines have also made it's way on this disc as well, but again...overall, this is not a bad album.<br /><br />After hearing Settle Down and Push and Shove, I got really excited to hear the album. When I finally heard it, I was a bit surprised to find it a little bit on the slower-ish side considering that Settle Down and Push and Shove are so upbeat. On the first listen that made me a bit disappointed, but after getting over that and giving a second and third listen I started to appreciate the album more. I've learned from listening to No Doubt over the years that if you go into this expecting anything from a previous No Doubt effort you're only going to create frustration for yourself. Each No Doubt album has a sound of it's own, and once you realize that I think that I think you can appreciate Push and Shove for what it is...a new chapter in No Doubt history.<br /><br />I've listened to this album a few times now and overall it's pretty good stuff. I keep seeing a lot of people whine and moan about how No Doubt is not ska anymore and it's time to take a moment and pull yourself out of the 90's because that is the last time they were. If No Doubt were making the same time of music now as they were then, they wouldn't have a record deal because the same people who are whining about them \\"selling out\\" would be whining about how they are still doing the same exact thing and would not be buying their albums for that reason instead. Bands evolve, and that is exactly what No Doubt is doing. I can understand and appreciate that people don't like Push and Shove because it's not the No Doubt they loved from the 90's, but there is no reason to bash this album because they didn't go back in the studio and make Tragic Kingdom 2 either.<br /><br />A lot of the album has a 80's new wave vibe, if that's not you're thing then you might want to stream the clips of the album before you purchase. I think anyone who has enjoyed either of the No Doubt albums post-Tragic Kingdom or \\"It's My Life\\" from The Singles 1992-2003 will enjoy this. Stop complaining about how this isn't like anything else you've heard by them and enjoy the music.e studio and make Tragic Kingdom 2 either.<br /><br />A lot of the album has a 80's new wave vibe, if that's not you're thing then you might want to stream the clips of the album before you purchase.

B003B1X80Y|5.0|I ordered this movie because the brief synopsis I read made it sound like something my wife would enjoy. When I told her it was coming in she immediately recognized the title which was more than I could say. We watched the movie last night and that was an experience in drama that I'll not soon forget. James Garner's performance as the reader moved him a few notches higher in my opinion of his acting ability.<br /><br />The story involves the telling of a story within the main story and the James Garner character is the one reading the story from a book to an elderly lady in a nursing home. The movie is well crafted and securely held our attention as events unfolded. Since I'm definitely on the older side I was able to identify with the James Garner character and found him to be a sympathetic character indeed.<br /><br />The movie is an effective dramatic telling of lives lived and loves won and lost; it you have lived and loved this movie will have something to say to you. If you have the great good fortune to still be blessed by the presence of the one you love then this movie will shower you with feelings of thanksgiving and gratitude for that blessing.<br /><br />While there was some literary license involved with the ending it all worked together to produce a gratifying emotional experience that left me feeling grateful I had taken the time to watch it. It has a PG13 rating because of some sexuality but that is rather toned down by today's standards.<br /><br />On balance I see it as a celebration of life and love and a movie to be enjoyed by all who have had the privilege of living and loving.
1589795474|2.0|I can sum up the advice given this book in one sentence. Make good money working and be frugal. Sure, its interesting to know most millionaires don't live the flashy lifestyle we're taught to believe they do, but I'm not a doctor that can afford to save tens of thousands of dollars a year either...good to know that there are some millionaires out there that are smart and know how to hold onto their money. It's pretty common sense if you're already in that type of financial position.

B001AQO3QA|4.0|I wanted Blu Ray version of the series.  Package came very fast.  Im not gonna comment on the movies, except I really enjoyed 1 and 2.  The extras...wow...you can get lost in its world.  Loads of extra material.
B008RYN44U|4.0|I didn't even know that there was a new No Doubt CD coming out until I saw it in a Target advertisement. Since I don't have a Target close by, I searched for the CD at my local Walmart, which only had one copy in stock. I bought the CD and overall I'm happy with my purchase.<br /><br />Push and Shove has a different feel to it than their previous releases. It's not their best outing, but I enjoyed most of the songs, especially Settle Down, Undone, and Heaven.<br /><br />The Tracks are:<br /><br />1. Settle Down<br />2. Looking Hot<br />3.

B008RV5K5E|4.0|An impressively loyal adaptation of one of comics' most important stories, complete with social commentary, nods at dark chapters of the character's history and a glut of wanton brutality. Despite being ripped violently into two pieces, the story still functions very well and reaches a natural climax in time for the credits to roll after a drawn-out 75 minutes. I fear the end result may be a less-dense arching plotline, especially as most of the political commentary was removed from this chapter (presumably as it won't be relevant until the second) but there's still more than enough pulp to go around. While the storyline is doggedly faithful (indeed, most of the dialog is copied verbatim from the source), the artwork is both influenced by and notably distanced from Frank Miller and Lynn Varley's amazing work on the printed page. And, while that does rob the story of some of its character, the result is suitable enough; fresh but also familiar. Peter Weller turns in some decent work as the voice of Bruce Wayne, but I couldn't help but daydream about how Kevin Conroy would have approached the material. Very good, if not perfect.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I went straight from the first to the second.  Less Kink, more actionand suspense.  It's a great read.  Amazon, on the other hand, is a pain in the ass with these review requirements

B0055PGUYU|5.0|Charles Duhigg uses his skills as a journalist to engage the reader through scientific research that might otherwise put one to sleep. He documents his sources well. With just a click, (e-book) a doubting reader can access the information source and review the manner in which the research was conducted. There's no guarantee that the book will spring us into action to correct all those \\"bad\\" habits we've practiced over the years. But we can observe what we're doing. We can assess if we are seeking a reward that can be met in a more healthy way. Or choose not to.<br />I enjoyed this book and refer to it often in my work as a Service Provider for national weight loss organization.<br />cjh

B001DCQI8W|4.0|Aside all my admirations on Karajan and its perfect complicity with the Berlin Philharmoniker: I am a son of the digital era and at my first hearing, I was hapilly surprised of the quality of the recordings, especially the latest ones of this box set, and the perfectly record balance of each sections of instruments, that gave a full homage of Bruckner partitions with its virtuose use of all sections of instruments. Brass are incisives, \\"wet\\" enough and perfectly balanced with strings sections... what a pleasure to hear all sections in those complex blended \\"tutti\\" and \\"fortissimo\\"! Long story short... recordings gave the right homage of Karajan's masterpiece conducting, while general tempos are along the slowest interpretations of Bruckner's symphonies (see dedicated Anton Bruckner discography anthology website). I am one of those that found my best pleasure in Bruckner's symphony interpretation with faster tempos, but what a surprised to hear the 8th symphony interpretation so slow, but so incisive too... this is like hearing Carlos Païta's version at a slower tempo!<br />This box set is yet a perfect entry into Bruckner's work, but I would not recomend this alone... thru the last records I heard, I would also recomend's Skrowaczewski version of the 2nd symphony and Carlos Paita's wonderfull interpretation of Bruckner's 8th symphony.
1416594795|1.0|Dawkins first frames this whole argument on the premises that facts are subject to explanations he provides. So, we are to simply trust his ideas (p10)? Also, if we see, or someone relates to us, some contrary evidence we are not to trust this (p14,16).<br /><br />The author proves creation by the words natural selection (by whom?), positive improvement (p18), genes change as if from a guided hand (p32-33), eyes that are  sculpted (p45), flowers go to lengths to stop self-pollination (p47), etc. I hope for a better argument to make me think about this subject.<br /><br />This book really is only for people who have presupposed their ideas, before any serious thought has been given to the subject.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child never fails to entertain with the Jack Reacher series.  Wish he could do TWO BOOKS a year.<br />I read it in a day.  Now I have to wait a year,  or start the series over.......again.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I am really enjoying this series but I like book 2 better.  It has more of a plot.  For those people who get tired of all the sex in book 1, push through it and wait for book 2.  What a wonderful love story (and I'm only 1/4 way through!).

B000W93CHC|5.0|If you have read Follet's historical books before you know what to expect, and this book doesn't disappoint. Another breathtaking novel 1000+ pages long that I couldn't put down before reading to the end. Even though it is promoted as a sequel to \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", it can be read stand alone since the story doesn't depend on past knowledge of the previous book.

1416583432|3.0|I don't usually write book reviews,  but the author mentions feeding her dog some food items that are toxic to dogs.  Raisins and grapes can cause acute kidney failure in dogs. Tomatoes can be toxic to some dogs. Dogs can eat broccoli and asparagus in small amounts but can cause diarrhea. Carrots are OK for dogs to eat.<br /><br />The book is interesting as far as I have read,  but I felt that I should comment on the aforementioned<br />food items.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|My review of the extended version of AVATAR:<br /><br />When looking at the menu...Choose the 16 minute extended version!!!<br /><br />It does a great job of filling in the blanks that may've come up for you during the 2hr 50 minute theatrical version.<br /><br />Money well spent. Especially if you don't have a blu-Ray player yet.<br /><br />Enjoy!!
0143036742|2.0|At the beginning I thought I was going to enjoy this book. Elderly dotty Ukrainian widower falls in love with young Ukrainian lady with gigantic bosoms. His two daughters, who are not on speaking terms having fallen out over money, unite in their efforts to make their parent see that the bosomy lady is not in love with his bent and wrinkled body, but with the prospect of living in England and milking him of his meagre wordly goods. So far, so good.<br /><br />Initially I fell for the eccentric charms of Pappa, but as his new wife (with another husband in the Ukraine) moves into his home with her son and starts turning the screw on him, making his life a misery, I became increasingly irritated with his vacillation.<br /><br />When the story moved to the two daughters discussing their opposing ideologies and their parents' lives during the war, I began to lose interest as it had no bearing on Pappa's current situation and the tone changed from tragi-comedy to political history. As for the ending - pure farce.<br /><br />I am sorry to say that for me a promising start degenerated into a tiresome, frustrating and ultimately disappointing read. The best part was Pappa's treatise on the development and history of the tractor.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was totally \\"into\\" this novel.  It was most interesting to read about how they got ready to do a mission - I was proud to be an American and proud of our service men for what they do to try to still make this \\"the greatest country in the world\\". Since I'd lost faith in our country, this book made me proud again.  I was mesmerized by the actual capture of that evil man.  I have recommended it to everyone I know and will continue to do so.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I heard horrible things about this book. I was told that it wasn't as good as the first and definitely not as good as the 2nd, but I liked it way better than the 1st and possibly as much as the 2nd. It was so addicting that I had a hard time putting it down. Although there are still some loose ends that I would love to see tied up eventually, it's an amazing finish the trilogy.
0316228532|5.0|I was interested in reading some reviews of this new book and was shocked to see it got only 3 stars.  As I read the negative reviews, I realized that the vast majority of the reviews are from people who haven't even read the book and who are basing their \\"review\\" solely on the price.<br /><br />I have never heard of something so stupid.  It's just as dumb as giving a book I haven't read 5 stars.  But I feel I must to even out the stupidity.  Book reviews should be just that--reviews of books, not declarations of injustice or whining about something entirely irrelevant to the content.  If you don't like the price, DON'T buy it.  Or, here's a novel (no pun intended) idea, wait a little while until it goes down in price.  Or get on the wait list at the library.  Any of these are viable options.  Giving a misleading review is not.  It is unfair to both the author and to the prospective readers.
B0034G4OZE|5.0|It's Kind of a Funny Story is a well-made film that takes a somewhat lighthearted look at teen depression, frustration and angst; the filmmakers probably wanted to keep things amusing at times so that the subject matter would not turn off the audience. The plot moves along quite well; and the cinematography and choreography reflect great forethought. The acting is very convincing; the musical score is quite good and Craig's rock and roll star \\"dream sequence\\" also enhances the film.<br /><br />When the action starts, we meet Craig (Keir Gilchrist), a teenager fraught with frustration and depression mostly about keeping up with the other students in a school for the gifted; and it doesn't help matters that the girl Craig has his eyes on, Nia (Zoë Kravitz), is dating his best friend Aaron (Thomas Mann) for whom everything comes easy in life. Not only is Aaron able to score with the girl Craig is interested in, Aaron even has a 4.6 average! Craig is also under intense pressure to attend a prestigious summer school and give up his chance to have at least a little fun in his life. Unfortunately for Craig, this is all too much; he becomes quite depressed and contemplates suicide more and more. After almost killing himself, Craig checks himself into a hospital for depression and suicidal thoughts naively thinking he can be released the very next day because he has school and can't miss it!<br /><br />However, Craig can't be released all that quickly--hospital policy--and things take an interesting turn when Craig is told that the teen ward is being renovated and he must stay on an adult psychiatric ward. Craig naturally meets all types of patients: there is Bobby (Zach Galifianakis), a man with a daughter; a schizophrenic patient named Jimmy (Lou Myers); Craig's roommate Muqtada (Bernard White); Humble (Matthew Maher); Johnny (Adrian Martinez), Noelle (Emma Roberts) an attractive young teenager who cuts herself and more! While Craig gets therapy, he is attracted to Noelle and wants to get to know her better. Craig also develops a friendship with Bobby and their conversations form a good deal of the backbone of the plot. Of course, how everything plays out is the focus of the rest of the film.<br /><br />Look for more excellent performances by Viola Davis as Dr. Eden Minerva; Lauren Graham and Jim Gaffigan as Craig's parents Lynn and George; Dana DeVestern as Alyssa, Craig's younger sister; Ethan Herschenfeld as an \\"acid head;\\" Jeremy Davies as Smitty who works on the psych ward and Aasif Mandvi as Dr. Mahmoud.<br /><br />The DVD comes with some nice extras: there are deleted scenes and outtakes. I also liked \\"A Look Inside It's Kind of a Funny Story\\" and the footage of the premiere in New York City.<br /><br />It's Kind of a Funny Story will appeal to people who enjoy quirky drama films with some comedy and an inspiring message; fans of the actors would also do well to add this to their collections.and wants to get to know her better.

B008NCSZQ8|4.0|This is actually a pretty good movie.  I tend to like somewhat serious movies that provoke thought.  And this one is certainly no such thing.  But it is pretty entertaining.  The great Stan Lee finally realized his dream and got all of his superheroes together in one movie.<br /><br />In my view, Mark Ruffalo gave the best performance in the movie, as Dr. Banner/Hulk.  His character was well-written and he had an opportunity to show a wider set of acting skills than the others.  Robert Downey Jr. plays his usual cocky, cynical, smartass-genius character.  He's got that down pat.  He plays Ironman the same way he plays Sherlock Holmes.  Tom Hiddleston continues his role as Loki and does just as good a job here as he did in \\"Thor\\".  Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evan, Stellan Skarsgaard, Scarlett Johannson, Jeremy Renner, and Samuel Jackson round out the all-star cast.<br /><br />The ambitious Loki and his allies want to get their hands on the Tesserac.  If you saw Captain America, then you are already familiar with this item.  Using the power of the cube, Loki summons his army from far way to conquer the earth, enslave the humans, etc.  Our heroes battle it out with the aliens and saves the day.  The End.<br /><br />I rented this movie through my XBox.  You do need a Gold Membership in order to do that.  You can also rent via your PS3.  And lastly, through Amazon.  Ofcourse, if you want subtitles, you can always just buy or rent the DVD.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|I read every one other book of Lee Child, this is the worse product I have seen.<br />Ver disappointing, repeating too often, towards the end I got more disappointed all the way to the last pages.<br />\\"Hit the road Jack, come back no more\\"!<br /><br />2 stars was rated too high!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This book reads like it was written by a 5th grader. She consistently repeats herself and it seems some paragraphs are just cut and pasted from the two previous books. It's an excellent story line that could have been much better written by a more experienced and talented writer.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I am amazed at all of the editing features that that are available with \\"Adobe Reader\\". Incredibly useful Application!  And it's all for free...
B006699DDE|4.0|This is a seriously great book, which I have read aloud many times.  I purchased the paid version (as opposed to the FREE version) because of the N. C. Wyeth illustrations.  Unfortunately the reproduction of the illustrations is quite poor.  It does not match the (i.e. requires expanding) the screen of an iPad 2, much less that of the new iPad.  Also the color fidelity is quite poor.

0525953728|5.0|This book was so incredibly intriguing, I could not put it down. These men are such amazing hero's. Our freedom is due to actions such as these. To bad for the bureaucratic nonsense of Washington. If they let these guys do what they are trained to do, our military wouldn't be fighting with there hands tied. Take the \\"suits\\" on a mission, perhaps they might have a different perspective on reality.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I bought this book expecting the story of the capture of Osama Bin Laden but soon realized it is so much more. What it is, is the story of our miltary and their dedication in keeping us safe. I highly recommend this account of our modern day American heros, the ones who are never spoken about in the war against terror
1881273156|5.0|This book is great, I believe it is a must have to learning yours and your other half love language, there's 5, and everyone's different... read more to find out how to better communicate and love with your other half and others who you are close with.

B006HTUZ1C|3.0|The game it's fun to play.  It does wonders got improving math skills for young ones and adults alike.  It has kept me on my toes!<br /><br />However, its UI needs some help.  The game prioritizes the block falling over user input.  When the game gets to higher levels, it's unplayable - you have to tap several times just to get it to react once because the block falling event overrides the user input and the falling event triggers rapidly.<br /><br />A great feature to add would be a&quot;relaxed mode&quot;, where you can set the pace and keep it slow for young kids just learning how to do math.<br /><br />Developer: check out the name- brand Tetris app behavior.  It interrupts the block progression to process user input.  This is a five-star app but for this issue.  Good work!
B00746TURW|4.0|This is a story of a young 15 year old Montana boy who for more than half of the book lives with his dysfunctional parents and twin sister during a few months at that age. His unbalanced father robs a bank, his mother supports the father, they both go to jail. To avoid being put in a home for orphans the youth escapes to Canada alone, his twin sister runs away on her own.<br />By the time one gets 2/3rds the way through the story it picks up. The first section of the family life in USA at age 15 was too long. The book begins to take off when the youth goes to Canada, and his years in Canada are catastrophic, however his  intelligence, stamina, wisdom beyond his years, and a fair amount of luck seems to see him through his 15th and 16th years. The final part portrays the purpose of the story and it ends up being a good example of how intelligence, a strong emotional health and personality can overcome great suffering and lead to a  productive and happy life.<br />It is well worth reading, if you have the patience to plod through the first half.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Great escape, a lot of twists and turns. But then who would pick up a hitchhiker at night? Tom Cruise???

The sound quality is clear and they are extremely comfortable. They do leak noise but that does not really matter to me. Overall I am thoroughly impressed and I believe you will be hard pressed to find a set this nice for this price anywhere.
B008VOHQNQ|5.0|All my reviews are 5-Star rated.  Great show!  The importance of this episode is to explain what happened 5 years prior to now. Most of the \\"whys\\" are answered in this episode.  The viewers get a glimpse of Harvey's past and the importance of his father's role in his life; and, how it has influenced his life up to now.  In this episode, the viewers are able to understand why Donna and Harvey's relationship is so close/tight.  The details of what Hardman did to Jessica and the firm, and why they both do not like him.  More importantly, they don't trust him.  The flashbacks in this episode are great.  I love that a little of Mike's past is revealed as well.<br /><br />The person who wrote the review that this episode was boring?  What planet are you on?  Really?  I think you need to watch it again, OK?<br /><br />Josey Newman, Atlanta, Georgia
B004GTKP3S|5.0|I really enjoyed  the shows.  It was a nice wrap up of the lives of some of the people from Cranford.  There are some characters we don't see again and some that are new but it's a nice mix.  The people seem real, ordinary folks dealing with the challenges of their time with faith and fortitude.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Maybe I am not being fair but, based on the reviews that I have already read, the use of the \\"f\\" word and other profanity is not entertaining to me and I will not read a book that is laced with it.  If I start a book that \\"sucked me in\\" with it's description and find that the profanity is there, I dump it and go to another.  That's why I mostly get the free ones or ones for a few bucks.  I won't wast money on such things.  This author was so successful with the Harry Potter series without the bad language.  It saddens me that she would resort to using it just because she is writing for adults.  Doesn't say much for us older folks does it!!  Sooooooo, I am rating without reading this time.  Sorry if I offended anyone.  Not my intention.
B00628RVV0|4.0|I was stand-in and a photo double for Asa in the upcoming Ender's Game--excellent young actor.  I would recommend to all.  The juxtaposition of his innocence and the cruelty of those around him truly stir an emotional response and sadness for all the atrocities committed.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is a good app. Its in my kindle fire and it works. It show me where's the storm going and see video about something that happen.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A story that tells what really happened. I couldn't put the book down even though I had other things to do.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I can see the price for myself when looking at purchasing the kindle edition so I don't need 20+ people telling me that it's too expensive! There was only one review of this book out of MANY that was actually about the content of the novel. I love JK Rowling and grew up with Harry Potter so I will buy this book and pay the $17.99 without a complaint. As Americans, we pay for convenience... that's what makes the economy go round people! If you don't like the price DON'T BUY IT! If you want to read it I'm sure you can wait until the price drops or it's available at the public library. The world has enough REAL victims without all of us thinking we are because of the price of a book... get a life!
0345803507|5.0|I had heard good and bad about this trilogy and had to find out for myself.  I loved this story, all 3 books. There really is a beautiful love story here, almost a 'beauty and the beast'. I started reading and could not put the books down, I've never read 3 books so fast in my life. I wish I was Ana!!
B007THA4FI|5.0|excellent character portrayal,insightful,and as an agatha christie fan, i was quite pleased to find a novel reminiscent of her style.  thrilled to become lost in the fantasy of an english village setting with a cast of amusing and brutally real characters

B0080SZ0V8|5.0|love this game. it has challenging puzzles and an interesting storyline. the only problem I'm having is that the tilting ball puzzle doesn't work with kindle fire... there's no dedicated gyroscopes that I know of in the kindle fire, and without the gyroscopes, the puzzle is impossible to solve. I'm hoping that I don't run into another tilt puzzle, as I'm out of orbs... maybe something for the developers to consider... a kindle fire specific one.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book definitely spoke to me.  We treat our feet poorly, especially compared to how we treat our hands.  Wearing shoes all the time clearly is warping them and preventing them from working naturally.  One caveat, if you're used to wearing shoes, don't just go out and run barefoot for a long distance.  If you don't ease into it, you will likely hurt yourself.<br /><br />Well written and interesting, even if you're not interested in barefoot running.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|whoever wrote the algorithm for this app is a genius.  I just got it today, and despite all of the random and obscure characters I throw at it, it gets it every time!  highly recommended.

B004LWZWC4|5.0|This is a must watch movie. Its funny and has lots of great birding stories. The best part is that it true well basically. These three guys did exist and did experience many of what was on the movie. Jack black's character Greg miller (his real name) really did work 60 hour work weeks and did a big year. If you love the movie make sure to read the book. It adds a whole other element to the movie when you know whet they really accomplished in a year.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is so good it should be against the law.<br />Very addictive and challenging. Even the easy<br />ones are fun. I double-dog-dare you to not<br />like it!
B0000028SR|4.0|Human Touch doesn't feature the E Street Band(except Roy Bittan), but it's still a top-notch album. I listen to this much more than Wrecking Ball and Working on a Dream because the songs have a classic Springsteen sound and are lyrically superb to anything from those two records. I think Magic, The Promise, and The Rising are his best albums since Tunnel of Love. The two best songs on Human Touch are Man's Job and I Wish I Were Blind, both classics that never received much airplay. The title track, Real Man, Roll of the Dice, Real World, and The Long Goodbye are the other standouts. Most of the others are passable except for 57 Channels,Pony Boy, and Cross My Heart. I would recommend this album to any Springsteen fan and anyone who enjoys old fashioned rock and roll. You'll be grateful not to hear the Irish accents, rap, and an overblown choir that are all present on the Wrecking Ball train wreck.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is easy to pick up and play. It's very fun and has a nice HD appearance, which I like. One of the great mobile games out there.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I know there was a lot of controversy over this book but you know this guy saved so many lives and helped  keep our country safe.  he just wanted to get the story straight and he honor ed the deceased and i just thought it was a great and interesting read that i recommend.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|use it every day with my kindle fire. I like knowing exactly how much charge it holds and what it can be applied to.
B00000DQSV|5.0|I was about 16 when I bought this tape back in the day.  I loved it then and I love it just as much now.  I had lost most of my Duran Duran memoribilia and for some reason they've been on my mind so I decided to rediscover my band.  I bought the greatest hits but it wasn't enough.  This album came out after their projects with Power station and Arcadia so I can see alot of the influences from those experiences on this album.  It's still fun to listen to especially Meet EL Presidente.  highly recommend.
B007J2TMQ0|5.0|This is one of the definitive works on a subject that always enthralls. Antony Beevor manages to inform, entertain and stimulate by his use of individual accounts and macro analysis of the strategic issues. The war is not a subject to be taken lightly, but AB provides the occasional morsel of levity that ameliorates the overwhelmingly sad business of conquest and bloodshed. A worthy contribution to the vast collection of WW II literature.
B00846REIS|5.0|i don't understand all the bad reviews on this book! i loved it and can't wait to read the rest of the series. i also by no means see how this is JUST LIKE 50 when there is no BDSM! read the book. it is worth it. i read it twice.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this is awesome one of the best glue games ever made cant wait to start playing again it is unbelievable
B007SGM084|1.0|This series was a true disappointment to me and actually insulted my intelligence.  Born to a crack whore, yet multi lingual, our \\"hero\\" is a concert pianist and a billionaire at age 26.  Also our Anastasia, a virgin who has never touched herself is so insecure and says the same things over and over.  Does he really love me, Is he thinking of Mrs Robinson.  It is sooo annoying!!  I would not recommend this book or series to anyone!
B008C1O8CA|5.0|I know there will be folks who say that \\"they've changed...sold out...blah, blah, blah.\\" What I hear is maturity. This is a band that could very easily sit back on their laurels after the past success and just coast. Green Day has taken all the best elements of their sound and squeezed in their influences to create a solid album from start to finish.<br /><br />Nuclear Family comes out of the gate strong and catches your ear with a great hook.<br /><br />Stay the Night screams Cheap Trick Tribute from the In Color days of the 70s classic rock band with a dash of The Tubes.<br /><br />Carpe Diem is catchy and fun. I want to say that it tends to emulate The Clash, but actually, it took me a few listens to realize that this track could be right at home on their debut album, Dookie.<br /><br />Let Yourself Go...all I can say is that this is pure pop-punk. I know those words are not supposed to be used together, butlet's face it...REAL punk has been assimilated.<br /><br />Kill the DJ is not my favorite track, it was good, just not great. It actually SOUNDED like they were trying to write something catchy.<br /><br />Fell For You is catchy, has movie montage soundtrack written all over it. Upbeat.<br /><br />Loss of Control is American Idiot with new words. Not a bad thing. It sounds like a Green Day song should.<br /><br />Troublemaker can't pin down who...but that has  wonderfully familiar sound to it.<br /><br />Angel Blue I guess I am not the only person to hear some serious Clash influence on this track. Easily my favorite.<br /><br />Sweet 16 every album has to have a song you don't really care for. This is mine. It was just too cutesy for me.<br /><br />Rusty James seems ready for pop radio right out of the box. This is the sound that Blink 182 tries for but just falls short of hitting.<br /><br />Oh Love sounds like the marriage of an Irish drinking song melded with a mellow punk sound that really sticks with yu after the album is over.<br /><br />Over all, I think this is a great album. Definitely something to add to your collection.nk this is a great album. Definitely something to add to your collection.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|[[ASIN:B004DLPXAO Kindle for Android]]<br />If you have a Kindle account and an Android device you need this app. Without it I couldn't read my ebooks on my Android. I have found that in using an Android tablet, in my case it's a Pandigital SuperNova, you should have your Amazon Kindle archive account listed as a favorite in your browser. This way you can go to your book list and simply tell it to download to which device you are using.<br />As with most anything you get or do with Amazon you can't go wrong. It's all good.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was a good book and honestly not as bad as I thought it would be. It is a lot like twilight but with changed names. I would recommend it to a friend to read though :)
B008O2T3O0|4.0|Initially I thought I had the same problem as another reviewer, that I could only get this to play in stereo. I am using a $500 Oppo universal disk player, so I doubt the issue is the player. After putting the disk in and out of the machine and playing through about 15 minutes of the music, the option to turn on the DTS worked. The sound quality is very good, quite a nice live recording, though you don't get a great sense of being at a specific spot in the audience, more hovering over it all. The picture is decent, though a little harsh. I am no opera expert, but the acting seemed boring and stilted. One reason I purchased this was the description saying it has 45 minutes of previews, but they are definitely in stereo only, which was a bit of a let down. I had bought the disk to test out surround opera. For the price, though, I am very happy. I would guess this would be a great addition to a serious opera collectors library for the price.

B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I remember I first seen Pink Floyd: The Wall back in my sophomore year of high school when I was 16 years old. This movie takes me back when I started listening to Pink Floyd again in 2005, just about the same time I listened to U2 for the first time. My favorite part of the movie was the walking hammers which was pretty cool. If I had the chance I would buy The Wall movie since I'm a Floyd fan. I recommend this movie to anyone.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I got this one because I got the seasonal one. It is just has hard for me to get to the different level, but still fun. My friends grandkids are better at playing this then I am.
031603441X|1.0|Buy this if you want to read a difficult-to-read, boring book about a very self-centered junkie. Before I proceed, I want to state that I'm a big fan of the Stones. I'm from the same generation and have always enjoyed their music. I read this book to learn about them, but it offers only bits and pieces of their relationships.<br /><br />I'm not sure why he wrote this book other than to make money. If it was for money, he made a mistake because he ends up looking very bad. Most of the book is focused on his drug addiction which becomes boring as he drones on and on. He also paints a picture of self-indulgence and immaturity.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that he apparently dictated the book that ends up as a stream-of-consciousness tome. To add to this, he uses a lot of slang that most Americans will not understand. The end is very abrupt and left me wondering why I read more than half the contents. It's too long, poorly written, poorly organized, and honestly, too boring.<br /><br />Keith Richards talks about throwing knives at people, chasing someone with sabers, shooting guns, and threatening to slit throats (what!!). Apparently, he thinks of himself as a super hero. When someone has dinner with your future in-laws for the first time, I don't think it's kosher to smash your guitar when one of the guests has annoyed you. There are a few pages where he says he enjoys reading, especially the bible. He needs to read the bible more to understand that adultery is wrong and giving to charity is good. Despite his wealth, the only charity mentioned is his entertaining at Willie Nelson's Farm Aid.<br /><br />Again, the book is poorly written, too long, and boring. Save your money.
B00499LTLM|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is re-imagined for the 21st century, but is still true to the original characters. Perfectly acted, engaging stories, and wonderfully smart and clever. I don't have a single criticism. Absolutely, absolutely brilliant. You will find yourself frequently pausing and reviewing scenes to see if you can catch all the details of the cases.
B004GXKBFQ|5.0|This was a great movie for my Granddaughter.  She loves it.<br />Great experience in never never land. She wants to watch the movie all the time.

B004LWZW88|5.0|the movie is just funny. great movie all the way.  Antonio Banderas is just so good for this character. it fits him perfectly. there can never be another puss in boots. dont even try it.
0143119680|2.0|After page upon page of drinking tea, exercising, drinking wine, eating, taking walks, and other mundane details, the book finally got semi-interesting. But I literally had to force myself to finish it. I couldn't understand why the characters were so fascinated with Diana, a rather stuffy, banal heroine (if you can call her as much) with zero personality. How many times did she go to that library and we had to sit there with her while she perused old books? It felt like hours and probably was. What was the point of this? How many times did we listen to her select tea and talk about how delicious it was? How many times did this woman sit down to dinner and we ate with her? Half of this book could have been lopped off. And how did this thirty-something woman get by before Matthew came along to tell her when to eat, sleep, take walks, use magic, etc.? I also thought Matthew was a terrible protagonist and extremely hard to like. In fact many of the characters were unlikeable, especially the aunt and her partner. I've read some really decent books about vampires and demons, but this was not one of them. I won't be reading the sequels.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|A Song for ice and fire series is one of the best fantasy series I've come across in ages. Definately gives the lord of the rings a run for it's money! A MUST read

B007THA4FI|5.0|There is such a place called a library. You can check the book out and read it if you feel the price of the book is too high. People complain about the most absurd things. In the time it takes to type up a nasty review...most people would come to the conclusion to 1. go to the library or 2. wait a couple months for the price to go down. Work smarter not harder people! It would be really nice to read a review on the content of the actual book =)

B0087HT36U|4.0|this was a great game for the whole family.. It is similar to angry birds but I like it so much better.
0345803485|4.0|I had debated reading this book when I went through the reviews on Amazon and saw that so many people give it 1 star or if they could give it 0 stars. But I don't normally take reviews to the heart as much as other people would. I have heard many mixed reviews about this book many good and many bad. So I thought that I should read it to see for myself. I thought it was a very well-written book. I enjoyed the story line.<br /><br />The sex scenes were intense, filled with things I know not of. I felt Ana was a very brave person for allowing such things to play out as they did. Through a psychological standpoint I am very interested and intrigued by what has happened in Christians past. I want to know what happened to him as a child, and I want to know what this Mrs. Robinson character has done to him. Because in a sense it seems that she has ruined him, and his ability to have a normal sexual experience with someone. I want to know why he can't be touched and why he feels he has to dominate someone to such an extent. His overall character really interests me. In the end of the book I am very proud of Ana and how she got herself out of the situation. I know in the second book most likely she will return to him, but I hope she does a lot of soul-searching and realizes exactly what she needs in a relationship and talks to him about that. I also hope to find out more about exactly who Christian Grey is and what has made him into the person he is now. I also hope that Anna finds out and realizes who he is well because that will greatly help her to determine the extent and severity of his damaged past. This is a well-written book that holds your interest and keeps you questioning who exactly Christian Grey is.
B009GENZKS|5.0|I only found out about this movie earlier this evening, and I immediately came over here to Amazon to see if it was on instant video. I was already a fan of Degeneration, so when I found out it got a sequel, I was really excited. Holy crap, this movie blew me away. This is everything a Resident Evil movie should be, there's great action, great one-liners from Leon, Ada being a super hot super spy, Lickers, and more. The animation is great, sound and voice acting is fantastic (I even caught some sound effects from RE2 in there), story is kind of meh, but it's Resident Evil, you shouldn't expect much of a story. Paul W. S. Anderson needs to take a few lessons from this movie on just how to make a Resident Evil film.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game! No getting to a certain level and then cant ho higher. You get new coins every 9 seconds  and trying to get the large coins special coins and puzzle pieces go in the right direction is fun. Also as you build you get a big shake chance to make every coin drop. I play this game for hours, my fav game on my Kindle.
B003O86FMW|5.0|You really get a better feel for each of the characters in this second book. Gale for example, slowly starts to come into his own and as a reader you're left wondering about him at the end if the first book. Personally, I found the second book even more rivetting than the first.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Great app but the permissions it wants are WAY out of line. Does NOT need to know my calendar events. And it sure as #$%^ doesn't need access to my address list so it can \\"send emails without the user's knowledge\\"! Uninstalled until the devs remove the abolutely unneeded permissions. Would give it fewer stars if I could.<br /><br />Update - TWC has removed the unneeded permissions. So, I've upped the star count. Now if they'd just reduce the size of the banner, I'd give the app 5stars. In portrait they waste nearly half the screen with their logo banner.  In landscape, it is even worse.<br /><br />Update - Back down to 2 stars. The new look and layout is really horrible. WAAAAY to much wasted space
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game .endless amount of entertainment and great game when u have time to spare. its hard to put this game down.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|game flows easily but still challenges you.Definitely not for young kids. There is a scene with a dead body.You have to work around it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is an extremely fun game amenity really enjoy playing it every once and a while, but I wish the coins would regenerate faster
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was recommended by a friend and her book club. At first I thought it was a real \\"slog\\" to get through and then realized the psychological sickness of some of the characters.  I definitely never knew where it was going and never knew what I was reading was the \\"true\\" story or not.  From that standpoint it was enticing.  I just found it incredibly depressing that people can be so malicious and perversley cunning.  Glad I'm finished with it!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I don't usually write reviews for anything, however I just had to write one for this.  I want to start by saying that I am a big Metal and Country fan so Lindsey's kind of music is not what I typically listen to.  However I am a musician and her skill is just amazing.  Besides that her performances are so energetic and riveting.  I bought all of her singles off of ITunes, I bought the album of ITunes when it came out and when I went to see her play in DC I bought the physical copy as well.  Even if you don't think this kind of music is for you, trust me, give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.
B000002H2H|5.0|Sometimes you just need to blow off steam! And when I get tired of my boss at work or I can't find a date I like to rock and/or roll!<br /><br />Metallica has been rocking the free world for big time and I am one of their most passionate fans. I love the way the guitars sound like a garbage truck going over the side of a cliff!<br /><br />Sometimes, I'll be driving and I'll pull up to some ying-yang playing hip hop way too loud out of their Ford Focus and then I flip the switch on my stereo to \\"Ride the Lightning\\" and it blows their high school BS off the road!<br /><br />If my parents let me I'm going to get a \\"Freedom\\" tattoo on my neck and one of Lars Ulrich's face on my right hand. That way, if my parents go out for the night it'll be me and Lars alone and there's not a court in the land that can stop us from doing ANYTHING we want.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|First of all, let me say that the service from this provider was spot on. The film came in perfect condition and in a timely manner.<br />About the film...The Lorax is a film on the environment. That could sound boring but, let me tell you, it is not. It's sort of in the form of a parable and doesn't shove the environmental theme up your nose but, instead, in a perfectly delightful way it raises our awareness (and the awareness of our children) about wanton waste of the things of the earth.<br />Great film with a great message. I highly recommend it.
0871404133|3.0|E. O. Wilson, the esteemed Harvard ant specialist and world-class biologist, is no stranger to controversy, having survived the so-called \\"sociobiology wars\\" of the 1970s. Unlike most biologists, who are content to put out a few peer-reviewed publications in high-impact scientific journals as a means of advancing through the ranks of academia (assistant, associate, and full professor), Dr. Wilson has done the unusual and invented whole new fields of biological endeavor, which in turn have given issue to other areas of inquiry and otherwise informed other established fields. It is no different in E. O. Wilson, the esteemed Harvard ant specialist and world-class biologist, is no stranger to controversy, having survived the so-called \\"sociobiology wars\\" of the 1970s. Unlike most biologists, who are content to put out a few peer-reviewed publications in high-impact scientific journals as a means of advancing through the ranks of academia (assistant, associate, and full professor), Dr. Wilson has done the unusual and invented whole new fields of biological endeavor, which in turn have given issue to other areas of inquiry and otherwise informed other established fields. It is no different in \\"The Social Conquest of Earth,\\" in which Wilson sets out to provide the long-sought answers to the long-standing questions about the human condition: \\"Where do we come from?\\" \\"What are we?\\" \\"Where are we going?\\" Cleverly, Wilson initiates his search for these answers by introducing us to a painting many of us have seen, and whose artist we can identify, but perhaps not many of us can name. The painting is Paul Gauguin's famous \\"D'où venons nous? Que sommes nous? Où allons nous?\\" Three of the main sections of Wilson's book are given over to answering these questions, of course, through the lens of an evolutionary biologist who has spent much of his career studying eusocial insects and, reflectively, the eusocial human species. He has searched for answers to these questions previously in a series of masterful books, for two of which he has won Pulitzer Prizes. In addition, he has sought to remind us that of all the sources of wealth available to humans, biological wealth is of the greatest value, making biodiversity decline the most horrendous of crimes humans visit upon themselves and the planet at large. In a sense, Wilson has been preadapted (to use a word frequently used by the author) to explore such fundamental questions about the human condition, since he is a myrmecologist, a student of ants. Ants represent the other pinnacle of eusociality, which, by most any measure of biological success, have done much more with this capacity than have humans. So, one of the most important questions he and his fellow myrmecologists want to answer is \\"Why does eusociality exist?\\" It is in attempting to answer this question, within the framework of Darwinian evolutionary theory, that Wilson (and his coauthors Martin Nowak and Corina Tarnita) have ignited another firestorm of controversy in a recent paper entitled \\"The evolution of eusociality\\" that appeared in the pages of the extremely high-profile journal Nature. In this paper and in Wilson's new book, it is posited that eusociality has arisen not from kin-selection based on inclusive fitness, which these authors outrightly discount, but rather the interplay between individual selection and group selection, the one the classic driving force behind Darwinian evolution and the other a largely-abandoned theory that Wilson and his coworkers have resuscitated. Given that the paper in Nature appeared two years ago, there has been time for the Nowak/Tarnita/Wilson explanation to be attacked again and again. In addition, as soon as Wilson's book hit the stands, it was excoriatingly assaulted by the father of the selfish-gene concept, Richard Dawkins. Wilson appears a bit touchy on this subject in his book, since he goes on and on about how his theory of multilevel selection (individual plus group selection)has pretty much trashed the previously prevailing theory. As Wilson notes, the battle between these two competing theories will be waged continuingly in the years to come. For many readers, however, I among them, the most important of the three fundamental questions asked in Gauguin's painting and in Wilson's book is the third one, \\"Where are we going?\\" After all, it is by study of the past that we will find satisfyingly complete answers to the first two questions and since the past isn't going anywhere, we presumably have time to devise the answers. The third question, however, is one for which we can seemingly shape the answer. Even though E. O. Wilson is unquestioningly my greatest biologist hero, I am somewhat ashamed to say that his attempt at an answer is at best tantalizingly brief and at worst a waste of time, his to create it and mine to read it. I have to admit that I often have found his prescriptions of humanity's future to fall short, almost as though he fears to have to say the hard words. I found this to be the case in one of his seminal works The Future of Life (2002), which he ended with the following: \\"A civilization able to envision God and to embark on the colonization of space will surely find the way to save the integrity of this planet and the magnificent life it harbors.\\" In other words, if we can do the one, we ought to be able to do the other. I don't buy it. Wilson's statement appears to be a non sequitur. In the current book, he does much the same thing. In the last paragraph of an 11-page chapter entitled \\"A New Enlightenment,\\" he concludes with the following: \\"So, now I will confess my own blind faith. Earth, by the twenty-second century, can be turned, if we so wish, into a permanent paradise for human beings, or at least the strong beginnings of one. We will do a lot more damage to ourselves and the rest of life along the way, but out of an ethic of simple decency to one another, the unrelenting application of reason, and acceptance of what we truly are (emphasis mine), our dreams will finally come home to stay.\\" I am glad that Wilson ascribes this solution to the sixth great extinction crisis to \\"blind faith,\\" because since faith is defined, in one sense, as \\"belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence,\\" then I would have to say that Wilson's hope does not have a secure evidentiary foundation. In fact, a fair response to his closing paragraph would require another book that really does need to be written. So, if I think only two of his central questions have been answered, then what kind of \\"grade\\" do I give to a student who answered only two out of the three questions on the test? That looks like 67% or a D. On a five-point scale, as used at amazon.com, that would be a 3.4 rounded up to the nearest tenth or a 3 rounded down to the nearest whole integer. Okay, I am going to bite the bullet and give him a 3.

B006HTUZ1C|4.0|the game plays ok but the controls are a bit lagging.  It often gives you nothing that would add to make the right sum, and often in long stings where you cant help but get backed up.  the swap option almost never give a good match so it is not worth using.

B008S80P38|5.0|I love this album :) It is my favorite of mau5's albums so far!  It blends pretty much all of his musical styles into one great collection; every song is unique and beautiful in its own way.  My favorites have to be \\"Fn Pig\\", \\"There Might Be Coffee\\", and \\"The Veldt\\", but EVERY song is great! Any fan of electro and house shouldn't hesitate to buy this album especially at the price thats being asked!

B004NSULHM|5.0|I didn't like \\"The King of Limbs\\" on first listen but, \\"This is Radiohead, listen again.\\"  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />My favorite Radiohead album is \\"The Bends.\\"  Filled with great songs, it's my favorite rock album of the 90's.  \\"King\\" shows that they not only listened to The Beatles, but to Bach.  The songs are constructed of simple parts, combined beautifully.  On my list, \\"King\\" is almost as good as \\"The Bends,\\" and more unique.<br /><br />Check the music channels on your TV for the \\"From the Basement\\" concert.  These are haunting, hypnotic tracks, and listening to the 30 second samples provided don't do them justice.

0425263908|5.0|Love this book, already ordered the next 2 books that have not even been published through Amazon and will probably get it before anyone else as Amazon gets your orders to you faster than any other online site. It is so easy to get my books without having to the bookstore and hope they are not sold out , I never have this issue with ordering at amazon .
B000FC10IO|5.0|book 2 left on a cliff hanger and this one picks right up where it left off. Non-stop action throughout the book. If you liked either of the first two- this one is a must. A must for fantasy fans.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I don't have much time to read, so it's been awhile since I book grabbed my attention as this one did!
B000FC13MM|5.0|this is the first book in a great trilogy. Sabriel is a proper girl raised in a world without magic, though she knows of it from the aberhorsen- her father who is a necromancer. When he disappears, she is thrown into the magical world beyond the wall. It is quite an adventure. This story was quite unique and did not follow the ordinary teen pattern found in many books right now. I found myself continuing to read drawn on to see what would happen next. Granted, I am not a fan of zombies and there were a lot of scary dead described in this book, I found it was done great enough to give chills but not to keep me awake at night. The story draws you in and keeps you reading. And as a side note, when the author explains that this story began with ideas from Hadrian's Wall that separated the Great Britain during the roman occupation, the story takes on even more depth. It was a great self-contained novel and I was very happy to see that there is two sequels.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun yet challening good for the brain and great for anyone who likes good puzzle. I Challenge you!
B000FC12L4|4.0|I found this a harder book to get into than Sabriel. It is hard for me when the authro changes protagonists half way through the trilogy. The first part of the book was a bit slow, hence the lower rating than I gave both the first and third books. Once the action started through, I was hooked. I do not like it when an author leaves you hanging at the end of a book, but since they were all three already published, I can live with it. (Don't you hate it when an author leaves you hanging and then you have to wait a year to read more??!!) If you get into this one, you'll have to read the next.
B004LWZW6K|4.0|I loved the first Piranha and this one comes mighty close to being just as great in my opinion. It's exactly what I'd hoped for. I really liked Danielle Panabaker & Katrina Bowden and the rest of the cast werent bad either. The \\"Baywatch\\" scenes are classic - make sure you watch through the end credits for more Baywatch/Hoff funnies. I bought this dvd straight up without seeing it at the cinemas and am so glad i did.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|When I get to the end of a Harry Bosch story, I don't want to stop.  \\"The Last Coyote\\" didn't end where I expected it to.  Just when I thought the story was over, it wasn't.  I love how Michael Connelly writes and pulls me in every time. I love the way he can tie everything together at the end.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|The premise of having humans coming from another planet to populate the earth is not bad at all, it intrigued me how would a human conceptualize another human as its own creator, I mean, that is basically what the bible says, God created man in his own image. So if there was a human race that would be able to go to a planet and plant the seed for human procreation, so many questions emerge that a I get goosebumps if this idea had fallen in the hands of a good creative writer. So there I was waiting for creative breakthroughs, interesting dialog, good action sequences... but what I got was disappointment over disappointment, especially at the end. It reminded me the movie \\"The Mist\\" which takes you to a good level of entertainment, and at the very end they blow it. But that's just me.
B007SGM084|4.0|The first book is very good.  I typically only read horror or suspence books, but due to all the hype I had to read at least the first book for myself.  This book left me wanting more.  So of course, I ordered the trilogy.  The second book was better than the first, the author gives great details.  You just have to keep reading.  I'm not done with the third book, so I can not comment on it, except I come home wanting to read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find that there is a little strategy to apply to this game. Not having played it much in an arcade, I wasn't sure what to expect. Sure, it's a very simple game, which could get boring. I enjoy it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|amazing must read great book love suspense and erotic. . . . . . . . . . . 5 stars all the way read the whole trilogy
B005DJGMQE|2.0|I'm about a third of the way through this (watching it over lunch breaks) and I was just taken up short by the dialogue I just heard; it's literally a paraphrase of the very same lines taken right from the movie \\"Breaker Morant.\\"  The captain has just arrived at the suspects jail cell.  Her exchange with him asking about his experience, all the way up to where he tells her that he only knows what he has read in the papers is line-for-line virtually the same as the exchange between The defense attorney and LT Morant and his men when they first meet in the prison in South Africa.  What a shamelss ripoff of writing!  And from a production backed by Robert Redford?!?  How shameful.  The movie just dropped at least one star.  I will add to this if I find any more sequences that seem to be copied.<br /><br />...OK, I now watched the first courtroom sequence and the cross examination of the divinity student, the raising of objections by the prosecutor, the \\"you are a liar\\" outburst from a prisoner, the style of the defense attorney beginning by bumbling and then finishing strong were all extraordinarily similar to the first courtroom sequence in Breaker Morant where Captian Robertson is torn apart. Did the director and write have no decency?  It is such an obvious rip-off of that movie.<br /><br />...Again when Mary objected to the inkeeper's lying testimony and was told that her objections prejudiced her case, this was almost word for word from Breaker Morant.  The scene where the army captain changes his story and McAvoy is flabbergasted was also very reminiscent of the scene in Breaker Morant where the general refuses to confirm the order to execute prisoners.<br /><br />Overall, if you were to watch the two movies side by side, you would be struck by the similarities in the courtroom dramas, as well as in some of the other scenes and the overall sequence of the narrative and shots.  Even the times when the court adjourns were similar.  I have never seen such a flagrantcopy of a movie's rythm, scenes, dialogue and even shots.  Maybe this happens a lot more than I know, but I'm just shocked that the production designers, writers, director or whoever was responsible for this did not even make an attempt to hide it.  It's remarkable and so very disappointing coming from Robert Redford.  I have such great respect for his lifelong body of work, but this movie has truly changed my perspective.  If he can't make movies any more without copying from someone else (or allowing his staff to do the copying), then perhaps it's time for him to hang it up.  On the other hand, Breaker Morant is a truly excellent army-themed courtroom drama, also based on real events.  It was made in the early 1980's but the production stands very strong even today.  Rent and watch that if you want to see this genre done well. In the end, because of this plageurism-like copying, I had to give the movie 2 stars.  Oh, and Evan Rachel Wood acted terribly, Kevin Kline over-acted his role, McAvoy's wife was just wooden and terrible and many of the other characters were nothing more than characatures.  Even without the copying, this movie is not deserving of more than 3 stars.  The costumes and sets were good though, as was a lot of the cinematography.  If you like costume dramas like this, those elements might make it worth a watch.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I bought this because of the glaring reviews. The writing is very good but the story is somewhat disappointing. I read up to the third part, and couldn't force myself to keep reading it. The only lasting character is the silo itself, on every part you have to re-establish emotional bonds with new characters and I find that tiring. After a while I was mostly bored while reading it since not much happens at any given point, mostly just explorations of the few characters thoughts and feelings with hints of a larger arch that doesn't seem too have any huge surprises.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I found myself totally consumed with The Hunger Games trilogy. I absorbed all three books into my consciousness while using my treadmill each day. Since I've finished reading them, I have fallen into a pit of despair wishing I could latch onto similar reading - or at least find a series of ebooks that I can devour, savor, relish and not worry about finishing them too soon! I've gained 5 lbs back and haven't hit the treadmill in weeks! I need more Hunger Games. Susan Collins is a master. I'm not into dungeons and goblins and hobbits, but I'm into something similar to the addictive qualities of the Hunger Games books. Please help me! Send recommendations, oh Kindle users, I beg of you...<br /><br />Now on to the video review. What movie has a chance when a viewer has read the book(s) first? The movie was very good but there's no way it can fully resemble the lush and detailed written piece. Sorry. I should have seen the movie first. No question that the leading lady was phenomenal. Jennifer Lawrence is gifted. I need to see the video again because I couldn't shut UP through most of it. (My viewing mate was oh so patient with me.) It did appear that the script was pretty much true to the book. CAN'T WAIT FOR GIRL ON FIRE and MOCKING JAY.

B008M34INW|5.0|I was not expecting the movie to be this good. I don't know why, because I love Mel Gibson's movies. This is a must see. I originally rented it, then after watching it, I felt I must own it. I buy very few movies because most aren't worth watching multiple time, but this one is.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|\\"Amazing Grace\\" is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It is the story of courage, persistence and hope.  Perhaps we need another William Wilberforce to stop today's slave trade - a much larger and just as sinister a  trade as it was the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.  I urge everyone to see \\"Amazing Grace\\" and learn how the enslavement of anyone is a crime of monumental proportion.
0439023491|5.0|The Hunger Game was a great book, but Catching Fire is even better. The story is getting deeper and more complex. As another reviewer stated, it's a \\"rollercoaster ride of a read\\". You'll never be able to guess what happens next. And once you start, you can never stop until the end. Relationships between Katniss, Peeta , and Gale are also getting more complex. This separates the Hunger Games from other shallow YA romantic fantasy. Their relationships reflect social issues and humanities this trilogy deals with.<br /><br />The pacing is wonderful.  Every time I went to set the book down something else would happen and I had to keep going. The many rises and falls of the story are very well set to keep you going, no interest lost quickly here. After reading both books I feel I really know these characters very well, through what they have done or not done along with how their friends and family react or what they say.
0736092269|5.0|No matter how many times this book has been rewritten, it still is one of the best books out there.  The information given never grows stale and is prevalent to any generation that may read it.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|it's the worst app I ever got. terrible graphics,  controls r confusing.  And  you only get 1 character,  1 race and 1 track . Lastly it's all advertising for the full version. DO NOT GET !!!!!!!!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book was great. It kept my attention and I couldn't put it down. I loved the bantering back and forth between the two main characters. It was a great read I recommend it for all those who enjoy a good romance book.
B0029XFN9O|3.0|Home Alone 2 may as well be a remake. That's how close it follows in the footsteps of the original. It's a formula starting with the McCallister family going on Christmas vacation and ending with them celebrating elsewhere after reuniting with Kevin. This time he gets left at the airport, which sends the family to Miami and Kevin to New York City. He's alone again, if one can ever be alone in New York City, but he's not at home, so the title no longer makes sense.<br /><br />Once you realize you're basically watching Home Alone again; different details with the same basic plotline; you start to anticipate the one entertaining part; the part where The Wet Bandits, now known as The Sticky Bandits, fall victim to Kevin and his booby traps. Even though you know how everything's going to end-up, that climax does not disappoint. It's still fun to watch those two idiots become real-life Looney Tunes characters before your very eyes.<br /><br />marcellee.com

B00005B1W7|4.0|This is an intriguing variation of the story of Gisi Perl (&#34;Out Of The Ashes&#34;).  As one who has read 100's of Shoah memoirs, I thought this movie sounded like it'd be dynamite, and in fact, the story is gripping, the acting superb.  The first DVD was so powerful, I stayed up till 7:30 a.m. watching it (and resented having to finally go to bed, LOL!).  Yet, for all of that, ultimately, it's one long propaganda film (Goebbels, though he wouldn't approve of the message, would rate the propaganda skill as A+!).  Especially the closing speech by Cady is a bromide (and ironic in the face of what was happening in Israel at that very time!).
B001KVZ6HK|2.0|This is the most over rated movie ever made.People on Amazon who has rated this movie over 2 stars must think Dancing with the Stars is the best show ever on tv.The Avengers is all about CGi. There is no plot, wait a minute ! A man who wants to take over Earth is the plot..WTF.? It's crazy this movie made lots of money.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|A fan of Jack Reacher with a yearning to see him settle, or is the mystery girl he is chasing not for him?  Mindless entertainment at its best, and as always once you start Lee Childs' novels you can't put them down, this is another of his pefect two night reads.  Great story lines for a movie but a movie I would never go an see because the fantastic skill Lee has in setting and describing scenes, emotions and action is truly what makes me a fan who reads and admits to re-reading some of his novels.

The profile management is also very poor and non-intuitive, and will often inexplicably change for seemingly no reason at all.  Is it too much to setup a profile, export it to the device's onboard memory, plug the device into another computer and have it \\"just work?\\".  I guess not.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|I found this book completely delightful. I love how the author used the letter format to establish the storyline and the characters. As a result, this book is told in many different points of view. It was such a treasure to read this book. I loved it.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|This is a great film. Maybe not great for little kids, but certainly great for adults. It pays homage to some great films, particularly Roman Polanski's Chinatown. I don't usually write reviews, but all the 1-star reviews forced me to add another to the 5-star column. Rango might be slow, but it is not boring. It is a Western. Westerns are slow. It might have grotesque-looking characters. It is a Western. Westerns have grotesque-looking characters. It might be violent... you get the point. All summed up, this is one of the most intelligent, best films I've seen in a while and I watch a lot of films. People who don't like it probably didn't catch the wealth of allusions, don't like things that aren't pretty, and/or don't understand that a film doesn't have to be an acton-packed, Michael-Bay-explosion-orgy to be exciting. Rango certainly doesn't hit you over the head with anything or pander to its audience.<br /><br />My only complaint about this movie is that it was billed as a children's movie. That's not too surprising because major studios aren't ready to produce animated features for adults. (Except Avatar, that is and look how well that crapfest did.) The vocabulary is at a very high level. I'm pretty sure that at one point Rango trips while wandering in the desert. (He's never seen eating a cactus or anything, but it seems obvious to me.) It's dark, with explicit references to death looming over the entire plot. And Rango is clearly modeled after Hunter S. Thompson, who along with a certain lawyer and certain red convertible makes a brief cameo.

B007THA4FI|5.0|I started to order the kindle edition and than looked at the price. It was only a couple of dollars cheaper than the paper one. Having been in publishing I know the cost of paper and manufacturing and the Kindle edition is over priced.  I hope this is not the new wave of the future.  There should definitely be a larger gap between kindle and hardcover.  I am a big supporter of Amazon I hope this doesn't change my mind

B003ASLJO0|5.0|In Gran Torino, Clint Eastwood, at 78, once again directed himself.  This is his best film.  The Gran Torino is an automobile and prized possession that retired Detroit autoworker Walt Kowalski helped assemble.  Eastwood, as Walt, is a cantankerous, racist, beer-chugging  Korean vet who keeps his shotgun ready to lock and load.  Walt is like a retired Dirty Harry, except the Dirty Harry part is still on the job, a sort of security guard of his property.  When gangs begin to threaten his neighbors, Walt's duties expand and he begins to notice that he has more in common with those he called \\"gooks\\" and \\"chinks\\" than his own sons and grandchildren.  He becomes a tough-love surrogate father to Sue and Thao, the two teenage Hmong next door.  The film is both funny and moving.  A treat not to miss.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just as captivating as The Hunger Games and Catching Fire.  Book three of this trilogy continues the story of these characters.  This is just as good a read as the first two books.  It expounds and continues the story which began with Hunger Games and continued .  These books are absolutely unforgettable!  A must read for anyone who saw the movie Hunger Games.  Congratulations Suzanne Collins, job well done.
B004SIP71M|4.0|The setting is Saint Nicholas Church School in the Bronx in 1964. The progressive priest, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), presides over the school and its church.  Sister Beauvier (Meryl Streep) is the tough school principal,  Sister James (Amy Adams) is a young idealistic newcomer, and Mrs. Muller (Viola Davis) is the mother of the boy who becomes central to the conflict.  The controversy: Did Father Flynn engage in an improper relationship with student Donald Muller?  Anyone attending this film will likely root for one or another of the characters, maybe first one, then another, and if you attend the movie with others, I expect that afterward there will be discussion and disagreement as to what is true.  One thing is certain:  you will know that you can never be certain that your belief is correct.  You might  realize also that none of us can ever defend a position of uncompromising certainty and that therefore humility is appropriate when making any judgments.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Book two of the Hunger Games trilogy is just as wonderful as the other two books.  I could not put these books down until I was finished with all three.  A must read for anyone, especially those that saw the movie.  These books expound on the story with much more information related to the characters and their interactions and underlying feelings.  Quite an adventure.  Congratulations Suzanne Collins, well done!
B001U0HBPG|4.0|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is based on a story by F. Scott Fitzgerald about a man, born in 1918, who ages in reverse.  Benjamin's baby body looks like an 86-year-old with the same illnesses common to that age.  As the years pass, the body becomes younger.  The film explores the conundrums of this condition, such as  falling in love and fathering a child.  Brad Pitt plays Benjamin simply and admirably, assisted by technology to give him an aged body and by younger actors in closing scenes.  Cate Blanchett plays Daisy, a dancer (she does almost all of her own dancing).  Their love relationship begins when both are adolescents; yet he appears to be an old codger, upsetting Daisy's grandmother.  They are perfectly matched when they are in their forties.  But then a child is born and decisions must be made, as they know Benjamin will become gradually younger.  The story is told in a nursing home in New Orleans in 2005.  Hurricane Katrina is raging as a dying Daisy has her daughter read Benjamin's diary to her.  We see the flashbacks of his jaunt through the 20th century, and Daisy's daughter discovers her identity.  The film evokes contemplation on that century and on the nature of time itself.

B001N26GFC|4.0|In the first few scenes of Happy-Go-Lucky I found the main character, Poppy, to be tiring, maybe even empty-headed.  As the movie progresses, however,  this amazingly sunny Britisher shows herself to be intelligently dedicated to her young students, loyal to her friends and family and uncannily wise about the psychological upsets of those about her -- whether a street person, a student, her sister, or her driving instructor.  As usual with Mike Leigh's films, this one is both funny and deep.  My favorite character: Poppy's Flamenco dance teacher.

B001PPGAIA|4.0|Australia, Baz Luhrmann's epic adventure, is a story to expiate the racist sins of a nation's past.  In this melodrama the heroes are pure and the villains totally wicked.  Our heroes must try to keep the villains from stealing their cattle and from sending the mixed-blood boy, Nullah, to a state-sanctioned training school (similar to those for Native Americans in US history). On the marquee you will see Nicole Kidman, playing an Englishwoman whose husband has been running a cattle station near Darwin, and Hugh Jackson, a drover.  But the key players are the mixed-blood Nullah and his grandfather, the Aboriginal named King George.  They capture the beauty, mystery, and wisdom of the ancient Aboriginal culture, the heart of Australia, the country, and the movie.
0452295548|5.0|My stroke of insight by Jill volte Taylor was an excellent novel. She went through her entire stroke and gave both the insight of the good and the bad. I would recommend this book because it will help you examine your inner self in order to become a better person and even  Rub off on others around you. The brain controls almost everything you do and we can control which feelings we wish to feel by changing our way of thinking.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|The Reader is a fine film.  A young German youth, Michael, meets 30-something Hanna, who introduces him to sex and with whom he shares his literary studies by reading to her.  After a summer of liaisons, she disappears.  Years later as a young law student he sees her on trial as a Nazi prison guard.  This  brings up many strong emotions for him, and he discovers one of her secrets.  He can't bring himself to step forward and reveal the information that would enable her to receive a more just sentence.  The film ends with a moment of redemption many more years later, when Michael finally breaks the spell of silent shame and begins to tell his and Hanna's secret story to his adult daughter.  The greatness of the film is its clarity about the ambiguities of morality and the importance of seemingly small things.  It is a tragic story -- a tragedy hinged on secret shame and on missed intimacy.
1451629192|4.0|This is a must read for people who don't understand the criminal mental illness involving child rape.  It's a soberly written story from the victim perspective ... at times the book needs editing but the decisions to let passages stand unedited increases the impact.  When read with Bill Louis' \\"If there were victims ...\\", the reader gets the full impact of the failure of the law enforcement system to adequately protect victims of sexual assault.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Woody Allen's latest is, I think, one of his best.  Two  friends, Vicky and Cristina, decide to spend July and August in the Barcelona home of Vicky's relatives.  They meet Juan Antonio (played by the amazing Javier Bardem), an abstract artist, and his former wife, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz).  A series of sexual liaisons occurs.  The film is a reminder that most people have had impulsive sexual experiences.  Sex tends to lead us into experiences we often do not intend.  And those experiences change us, teach us things about ourselves and life that we likely are unable to articulate.  Vicky and Cristina return to the U.S. mysteriously more mature.

B001P9KR8U|4.0|Slumdog Millionaire is about a Mumbai orphan who rises from rags to riches through the Indian version of \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.\\"  Jamal and his brother, orphaned as young boys, improvise their way to survival through such activities as pretending to be guides at the Taj Mahal.  At 20 Jamal appears as a quiz show contestant, and his life is told in flashbacks that reveal how he happens to know the answer to each question.  The television appearance also makes it possible for him to find his childhood love, Latika.  The movie combines a realistic picture of brutal poverty in India with a colorful style complete with a Bollywood dance ending.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie is a the absolute pinnacle of campy, queer excess! Mel Gibson is clearly an S & M enthusiast, and his lovingly shot scenes of hunky, muscle-bound Romans flagellating a tragically sexy Jesus rival the best Tom of Finland comics! Gibson has clearly shown himself to be the greatest living director of gay porn films! This is a homoerotic flesh feast!!! I actually saw this transcendent gem in the theaters and I could hardly contain my excitement during scene after scene of beating, torture, and humiliation. I actually had to make a trip to the men's restroom to &#34;relieve some tension&#34; if you know what I mean ;) Perfect Easter viewing for you and your loved one if you ever want to make that dull holiday a little spicier!
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|A couple of my friends had the privilege of experiencing Cohen in a Dallas concert.  This DVD was made in 2008 in the earlier part of his tour, his first in more than 15 years.  I can see why my friends raved so about the concert.  Just experiencing it on the couch at home is wondrous.  At least I can see/hear it over and over.  As gifted a performer as he is songwriter, Cohen leans on the side of subtlety on this tour and leaves you in tears of awe rather than cheering loudly.  He is phenomenal.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Great book. has an amazing ending that shows optimism in aspects of both personality and friendship. definitely read after Something borrowed!
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|what to say about a Jane Austen title? You love it or you love it not. For me Jane Austen is a favourite.<br />And EMMA is worth reading, also my all time favourite is PERSUATION.<br />The quiet suffering of Mr. Knightley and the blindness of Emma - how often is this happening in real life, is it not?
B001HBWY8M|5.0|12/28/13  LOL, this review is the work of my teen. :-) T o funny to remove.<br /><br />I am 34 years old, and this is STILL my favorite movie. No, I don't have kids, but who cares? I LOVE Amanda Bynes's acting, I TOTALLY wanna start dressing how she does in this movie! This movie IS FANTASTIC, I really enjoy watching it 2 or 3 times a week with my 7 cats snuggled up to me. Some people say I'm crazy, but I really feel my precious kitties understand what's going on in the movie! The only part I don't like was when she was eating Cocoa Puffs. My kitties HATE the sound of people eating Cocoa Puffs! But, this movie is great, especially for middle-aged single women like myself! trust me gals, this will be a flick to remember! Ciao!
B008NB0SQO|1.0|Reading the Blu-Ray description included here, it says that the running time is 85 minutes, which is four minutes shorter than my copy on laserdisc. This can only mean that the exquisite song \\"When Love Is Gone\\" is STILL not being included in this release ...<br /><br />... which means I'm not buying it.<br /><br />Sorry, Disney, but I refuse to spend my money on a sub-standard presentation, no matter how HD it is.<br /><br />The story of A Christmas Carol is about Ebenezer Scrooge, not the Muppets. His character arc is the most important factor. Michael Caine gives a fantastic performance, and his greatest moment is during this scene as he tries to sing with the woman that Ebenezer loved and lost -- and he winds up losing his emotional control, unable to finish the song. This is why he turns to the Ghost of Christmas Past and says, \\"Spirit, show me no more. Why do you delight in torturing me?\\"<br /><br />If \\"When Love Is Gone\\" is not included, that question has no meaning.<br /><br />This wonderful film should not be released on Blu-Ray without including that moment! Disney, where's your brains?
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I liked Fifty Shades Freed the best of the trilogy. I was not particularly found of the Fifty Shades Trilogy. I was done after the first book, and a friend talked me into finishing it. I can say that I'm glad I did finish it, as book 2 and this one were not as sadistic as the first. In the end, I think the author gave the series a good ending.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Great value, the same battery is still working in my bathroom scale six months later; granted I don't have the scale on all the time, but the batteries were super cheap. The particular seller I purchased from--shipping was like a dollar, that was nice too.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Breathtaking, one of my favorite anime still holding the title after all these years. I show it to people who say they don't like anime or have never seen it so they can see the full potential artistic and quality anime can have.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|most blurays come with a digital copy and a regular dvd. this one does not. I had to break down and buy a bluray player once I realized this.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|With our current fascination with vampires, I thought I'd go to the beginning of things. One word to describe the book: awesome! Stoker was a brilliant and imaginative writer and very visually provoking via his word craft. I REALLY enjoyed this via my kindle app! I'm not an avid reader, but kindle makes the experience quite enjoyable with dictionaries and other resources right at your fingertips! Looking forward to my next classic!
B008XG1X18|4.0|It is a good way to kill time and just look at random stuff it is the next generation of social media it does glitch and crash every now and then but that is a minor annoyance.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|It is kind of weird, the first time I had seen the cover for this blu - ray some months ago, I was freaking pist; I wanted to yell, but I was in a public place. But then I bought the movie, and I really like the cover now, could better but, it is good. The Movie \\"The Avengers\\" is amazing, it gets a 5 out of 5, and the movie on blu ray is more then perfect, the movie on blu ray is th main reason that this blu - ray is a must buy. There is not much of special features, which dissapoints me, but it has some and one very good deleted scenes, the awesome one involving Cap., and a very cool short film that I enjoyed. Overall I would give this blu ray as a whole 4.5 out of 5 stars. I would like to have hours of how the film was made, but the movie is so good on Blu ray that you must have it, so get it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Excellent! but I did find a glitch when you take stairs and you place a door over it, the door multiplies into 2 or more! but still, beautiful.
B007SGM084|5.0|\\"Romance\\" novel does not began to describe this book. This powerful man knows how to step up and get things DONE! He knows all the right things to do and say to Anastasia, no instruction manual needed.......so hot.
B009329Y30|2.0|Mindless chick flick?  Definitely.  A movie that offers up a unique plot and doesn't leave you constantly comparing scenes to other cheesy chick-flicks?  No way.  Not worth your time unless you're in the mood for a mindless, predictible chick-flick.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game really captures hoe much fun the older Sims games used to be. A well thought out game indeed!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|it was a fun game. worth the 2 bucks.<br /><br />graphics were good and storyline was easy to follow. will get the 2 nd installment when it comes out.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Fun game but my kid finished all available missions.  Please add new missions &amp; maybe a female character for the girls.
B008220B0C|5.0|Besides having one okay maybe three of Katy's songs as ringers on my phone, I am a FAN!! I think she is unique and genuine all at the same time!! This movie just clarifies what I thought to be true!! You get to glimpse into her \\"Real\\" life day to day happenings. She refers to it as her video diary, and it is just that! If you love listening to Katy's tunes then I definitely suggest checking out the movie Part of Me! After watching it you will feel as if you know her!! We give it two thumbs up for entertaining and genuine!!<br /><br />Disclosure:  I received this DVD and a viewing kit  for review purposes only. I was not compensated to write a positive or favorable review. This is Keeping Up With The Rheinlander's personal opinion.
B003K16P50|5.0|Drags a little at times but so worth it! Absoluely loved this book. Good lessons about what is important in life, stepping away from societal pressures, finding belief and faith.
B006H5120E|5.0|I LOVE this movie!! I watched it several times when it first came to the theaters, and I still tear up everytime I see it. This magical 3D/Blu Ray DVD set allows it to come to life right in your living room. This is the perfect set to commemorate the 100th anniversay of the Tiatic this year. Definitely recommend this to others. Especially those that have an affinity for the Titanic and its history. We give it two thumbs up for fantastic entertainment.<br /><br />Disclosure:  I received this DVD and a viewing kit  for review purposes only.

1594203334|4.0|It's 2:30 in the afternoon, and two of my kids are in the kitchen, rustling around the pantry looking for something to eat. We just had lunch an hour and a half ago, but already they're back for more. Like many mothers, my kitchen has a revolving door. Sure, it's invisible to the naked eye, but it's there nonetheless, constantly spinning as my three children come and go, begging for snacks throughout the day. They're fed on a regular basis, mind you, but still they come, clamoring for string cheese and apples and those ubiquitous cheddary fish-shaped crackers. Shooing them away is a temporary fix. They're back within minutes, it seems, complaining of grumbly bellies that can only be soothed by the snack that smiles back. I will sit down to fold a basket of laundry, only to hear a familiar noise coming from the family room, where upon entering I will find three little guilty faces knocking back Pirate Booty behind the couch, crouched down like criminals hoarding their, well, booty.    Talking to my other mom friends, it seems that my house is hardly an oddity. Across the country, our homes are filled with kids who fill up on snacks throughout the day and who then protest when asked to sit down and eat a proper dinner. I wondered if parents across the world face the same type of daily kitchen conflicts, and the answer, according to Pamela Druckerman, is non! At least not in France. Druckerman, who is perhaps best known for her 2011 Marie Claire article in which she detailed how she planned a ménage à trois as a 40th birthday present for her husband (note to my dearest: No. Never. Nope. Not even as your last-gasp deathbed wish. You will likely be getting a new button-down from Banana Republic for your 40th birthday) is an ex-pat who chronicled her experiences observing French parenting in her 2012 book, Bringing Up Bébé.

0385344333|1.0|Warning some spoilers: I had missed the last three Reacher novels but was given this book as a gift. I love the Reacher character and thought after reading this that he must've been pretty tired as it wasn't the rough and ready guy I last knew. No way would the old Reacher leave a girl in a car like he did in this book - I thought that as I read it and then the oldest trick was used when we next supposedly saw her body burnt up a short time later - when they discovered that you knew that it wasn't her as how could the reader deal with Jack being such a pussy he'd rather argue with the motel guy over a bullet hole than go after her - but he did. The point that she was alive later is mute as this new Jack Reacher just let her speed off to her supposed death. The book was laboured, boring, had a stink plot, and lame characters who just drove round and round doing bugger all. Even how they dealt with the sheriff dropping dead and getting whisked away with no investigation, driving round in his car etc, the wierd set-up at the deserted witness motel, was just so unbelieveable it leaves me wondering if Lee Child even wrote this. I'm now going to struggle going back to read the other three and makes me just want the new Harry Bosch novel to arrive even sooner. Where's the old Jack?
B00881VLCE|4.0|Works fine no issues. Kindle fire. Great assortment of free puzzles, a little something for every one. Option allow you to make them easy or difficult.
B0090EIC3Y|3.0|The thing that made Borat and Bruno so funny is that he interacted with real people with real responses. No matter how outrageous his behavior in The Dictator, knowing that the response was scripted takes away most of the \\"charm\\" of his previous movies.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|It  was great and received in a timely fashion i couldnt ask for more cant wait for season five to come out.
B0087HT36U|3.0|Most levels are simple and straight forward to complete, but still enjoyable to play. downloaded as free app for the day, wouldn't recommend spending actual money on it though.
B008XG1X18|3.0|i really love pinterest and this app is great but I get really frustrated that it doesn't work most of the time and has to be forced closed...
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I am a big fan of Lee Child's books and have read all his Jack Reacher series and generally could not wait for the next one as I was with A wanted man. But having just completed it I was a little disappointed with the story itself. It didn't seem as compelling as others in the series. Well worth reading but a little disappointing I felt.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|i would have thought that to charge up my kindle fire i would plug it in wait til the light turns green and you're good to go.  not so according to battery pro. even though my light turned green, battery pro said it was only 75% charged. i kept the charger on longer and the app finally said 100%. you know what? my kindle lasts alot longer than usual.  now i have more play time. thanks to whoever made this app. its AWSOME!!!!
B0098VXE50|3.0|Overrated... story adaptation was just weak and Kristen Stewart was the weakest part of the movie. Her accent was horrible and uninspired. Acting is a stretch as it is for her and then you add an English accent to the mix.... you get a catastrophe. Charlize and the other actors were great. Visuals were okay as well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The game is so fun and mind bending, I have so much fun when I play the game.  Buy this App!  It's free!!

B0086700CM|4.0|this is an addictive but fun game.  I like that it is challenging but not so hard that u r not able to play past the first two levels<br />the fact that it was free was great plus
B005LAIHPY|5.0|One of the best action movies I have seen for a long while. My granddaughter, Husband and I sat and watched it together.  My Granddaughter and I were cheering, clapping and all three of us were laughing in parts. So far we have watched it twice and plan on watching it many more times. Very well put together.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have never enjoyed reading a series of books as much as I have with these. I have read them 4 times and I still enjoy them as if it where my first time reading them. I have recommended them to everyone I know. I am now trying to find other books that are similar to them. LOVE LOVE LOVE them!!!!!!!

B00846REIS|5.0|One of the best books i ever read!  Counting the days for the next one...loved gideon and eva...I really recommend it!!!!!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read all of Lee Child's books at least twice. This book had many of the elements that make his books so enjoyable. Reacher, his main character, is a one of a kind, larger than life good guy. The only problem with \\"A Wanted Man\\", was that the FBI would not work with a civilian, especially after some of Reacher's stunts. Government agencies have blinders on and rarely do anything that doesn't serve their purposes- Ruby Ridge, Waco, etc. Flexibility and compassion are absent when they are involved. I will read the book again, as I have done with all of J.L.Burke, J. Sanford, M. Connelly and even most of J. Lescroart and B. Eisler's \\"Rain\\" series. I would recommend the book, it's a fun read. I would suggest reading them in order though, and perhaps you too will see my point.
0812993292|5.0|Hi dee hi dee ho! I loved this story. I was hesitant to read it. I don't remember if that was because of something I read about it. Like the title and book cover, it seemed a little odd. I'm glad I overcame that and started yesterday. It sucked me in rather quickly.<br /><br />There are two \\"stiff-upper-lip\\" English protagonists and of course a journey. Harold's journey enables memories to flood both Harold and his wife at home. Once I got into it, I loved the premise. The journey prompted memories of my own and will for you, too. It's very simple and moving.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I choose to buy this book on the strength of previous reviews, and I was gutted when I got to the end to discover book 2 was not yet available. This is a great read for fantasy lovers, hope book two is as good.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|What a fascinating series, can't wait until Oct. when it returns.  character development is awesome!  Glad I purchased the viewing.
B008Y2IU12|5.0|Absolutely stunning picture great audio. This is one of my favorite movies ever I can't get over how great it is even though I don't like Kristen she did a good job in this movie

0805095535|5.0|Paul Auster wrote an autobiographical book - \\"The Winter Journal\\". As a faithful fan of Auster's prose, I had to read it - and I loved it. He begins with his childhood, and recalling the earliest events he can remember, at the same time philosophizes about memories, their accuracy, exploring the connection of the body, intellect and emotions. He writes about his scars, places where he lived, his love for his wife (the description of the car accident is so sincere!). He tries to come to terms with his age, getting old, his mistakes, his phobias and his weaknesses.<br />Auster is a brilliant writer. And yes, all the other reviewers have critiqued is correct - there are lists, collections of notes, loose bits. But everything is written in the unique Auster style and I cannot help loving this book like all his other books. I wonder how much of it is the literary creation, because I am aware it must be, but it seems very honest. It is really a journal, meaning that different thoughts are noted as the come, there is no chronology, and yet it reads wonderfully and the prose flows without stumbling.
B005PK1G76|2.0|I ordered this to use with my Britax B-Agile stroller.  I Velcroed it on a few months ago and I've never had to touch it again.  It is discreet and sleek and folds right along with the stroller.  This is great for drinks, keys, my iPhone etc.<br /><br />Update...after a few months of use the strap on this organizer just ripped right off!  It is useless and now I am going to spend the money on the Britax one I should have gotten from the start.  I suppose it is partially my fault for going the cheap route and getting the knockoff basket but the Britax one is a lot nicer.  I really wish Britax supplied it with the stroller but i wish more that I didn't choose to buy the cheap one first...ugh...
B007IXWKUK|1.0|What could have been a good romance novel the author turned it into a porn romance novel.  Should not be read by anyone under 18 years of age.  Needs to be in the porn section.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|I gave this to my nephew and he adored it!  He was thrilled and played with it constantly for a few weeks.  I think he is like most 9 year old boys though and wasn't super careful about gathering the darts after he shot it so he is now kind of over this toy since he is missing all of the darts.  Also, the thing that makes this so much fun is how many darts it shoots out but he did get a little annoyed having to chase after all the darts.  He was in a constant shoot, scavenge, shoot routine!

B008N5UX9M|2.0|Anyone who is as big of a Maiden fan as I am would naturally be excited upon hearing that Steve Harris is releasing a solo album.  However, before listening to a single note and researching how it all came to be, it becomes immediately clear that Steve Harris has a very different definition of 'solo album' than, well, anybody else.<br /><br />Steve has spoken of the already established band \\"British Lion\\" as early as 1992.  Look for the interview on the Maidenfans site.  It's a band he discovered and was looking to help.  Now, 20 years later, the band's debut album has finally seen the light of day.  Yes, Steve Harris has joined the band, and supposedly co-wrote all the songs (but as in Maiden, this could simply mean he helped with arrangements and/or perhaps added a little section to a pre-existing song, etc).  I have no doubt the plan is to use Steve's name to get the album exposure.  But make no mistake; this is by no means a true solo album.<br /><br />All that aside, if it's good, it's good.  Unfortunately, it really isn't.  Much has been made about the poor vocals on this album.  Really, they are indeed pretty thin, lack power, and have a certain amateurish quality.  Additionally, the production of the album is pretty weak.  The guitars and drums are underneath the bass (even much more so than on recent Maiden albums), and the album has a demo sounding quality to it.  But most importantly, I find the songs rather dull.  I can honestly say I find none of it very catchy, and it's mostly generic rock that never gets too adventurous.<br /><br />I am just glad we live in an age where music can be streamed legally before deciding to purchase it.  Wanting to give the CD a fair chance, I have listened to it about 5 times, and I do believe I have reached my limit.  I just hope Steve doesn't waste too much time on this project, at least not to the point where Maiden is put on the back burner.  I'm sure it's fun for Steve to do something away from Maiden, though, and I do respect him doing something different, even if it's something I can't get into on any level.  And heck, if worse comes to worse and Maiden does go on hiatus, maybe it would mean that it allows time for Bruce Dickinson to make another solo record.  If that becomes the case, then I guess I would have some reason to be thankful for British Lion.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I was using Mobi Pocket creator to build Kindle books, but it was a complex and painful process. With the hints included in this little book, I speed up the process of book creation nd the books produced have a much better appearance.<br />And it is for free!!!
B007PVHMCG|4.0|Great hit Formyduval son who is a minecraft but and Lego wiz! Put together easily and not much fun after that as too small to really play with but great novelty value. Purchased in amazon at good price when already sold out at Lego store and high price on eBay. Way to go amazon. With amazon prime it was here in no time too!
0385344333|1.0|Reacher drives all over nowhere USA, in a nothing story with not much plot.<br />Whatta shame, huge fan really disappointed , struggling to finish this book.<br />Oh Well.<br />Just finished book, i'm sure Lee Child had someone else write this for him , one more like this and i'm done.
B00125JP1C|5.0|Shoot 'Em Up is straightforward right from the get go: It tells you before you even watch it what the movie is about. And it delivers just that. This movie prefers to be vague and mysterious rather than spend time on pointless back-story banter, which means more of the movie is pure action. If you liked 300, you'll probably like this movie as well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put it down!  It is sure to kick in your sex drive. I highly recommend it for women and men!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Between the show or the book, I'd have to go with the book.  There's so much detail and name references which are a little weak on TV.  Dont get me wrong I love the GoT TV series but you just couldn't include everything so this book like the rest in the series is a must read.
B000GJ0KOG|5.0|Hilarious.  The movie is full of typical British humor. Can't say enough great things about it.  I highly recommend it.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|graphics need to be improved and other stuff u can use like a swordsman and a mate and a paladainin
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Never got to see this digital version for the movie because apparently this content is blocked for my region (south america), thank god it was free with the purchase of the bluray version
B0012NVGHU|5.0|I came across the song \\"Falling Slowly\\" in a book of sheet music for piano/vocal, and looked up the movie.  Friends had seen it and highly recommended it, so I ordered it.  The DVD arrived promptly and was in excellent condition, at a reasonable price.  The movie was a surprise: the music was wonderful and the story touching.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Oh, I'm probably as much addicted to this game as I am to Angry Birds, A LOT!  While I usually play it on my phone, having it on my Kindle makes for much more detailed (better?) drawings.  Fun fun fun.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|The story was more complex, with more twists and turns than most of the previous Reacher novels I have read.  I enjoyed this book quite a lot.
0307594165|5.0|This book was on my wish list, as I've been a Toni Morrison fan for a long time now.  My son got it for me for my birthday, and it was a perfect read.  The gentleness of her writing will bring warmth to such a conflicted character.  I'm not giving anything away, just to say that if you are a fan of her work, you may be a little surprised by this one.  In a good way.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the large format and the ability to go back over a long string of calculations. And the lit display provided by the Kindle Fire is far superior to small desk or hand held calculators. Good job.
B008FC4WA4|4.0|I wasn't used to reading Kindle singles and prefer longer books, but this one was well written and true to Nick Hornby's style.  It ended in a hurry, however, so the ending wasn't quite as satisfying as I'd have liked.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This new novel is quintessential Jack Reacher! You will love it! You have to love this character.  He is crafty,smart,very physical, highly trained, and always gets his man!
B004U52VPS|4.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for a 5 year old and once he opened it, it was the only toy he played with for weeks. It's a lot of fun to play with and requires both kids and adults to think which is nice. The only thing was that at 5 years old, he wasn't interested in following the diagrams/pictures and making the actual setup. He just figured out how to make one easy one and kept doing that over and over. It seems like a great educational game for kids, though probably only for kids over 6.
0525952926|5.0|Not since Herman Wouk's The Winds of War has there been such a more realistic and readable fictionalized account of the sixteen frightening years leading up to,including, and following World War II. In \\"Winter of the World\\", Ken Follett continues in the second installment of his trilogy with the next generation of the five families--American, British, Russian, German/ Austrian, and Welsh--whom we first met two years ago in the first, following them as they cope with changing political climates that plummeted the world into darkest winter.<br /><br />When I finished [[ASIN:0451232852 Fall of Giants: Book One of the Century Trilogy]] in October 2010, I was bereft wanting more of Follett's trilogy and spent the last two years impatiently waiting for Winter of the World. When I finally saw the full-page add in the Sunday New York Times Book Review three weeks ago, I immediately ordered it. I received it the day after its September 18th publication date, and spent most of my time happily immersed in the lives and times of its protagonists. Even though I know the basic background historical plot and sub-plots, it's the best kind of literary historical fiction that I cannot put down, eagerly wanting to read on-and-on the imaginative part as it unfolds and ends. But I don't want it to. It's that good!<br /><br />Five families again intermingle and intertwine, embroiled in the nefarious Rise of the Third Reich, the Spanish War, and the nightmares of four years of horrific world conflict. The stage setting of these true-to-life characters--heros and heroines all--burgeons with well researched and delineated historical facts and events--some of which, I am sure, are mere footnotes in history books--that Follett, with his clear, concise, fluid writing style has brought to the fore and back to life. Through his characters, Follett educates us with salient true describes and delineates--the best trait of any historical novel. For example, I was unclear about the deeper, more intimate politics and history of the Spanish War, which preceded and helped to precipitate WWII. But when Welsh-born Lloyd Williams, one of the primary heroes, volunteers to fight Franco and his fascists alongside the then current Spanish government's meager forces, I finally understood the real reasons for the conflict. And I also now have a clearer understanding of America's involvement, or lack thereof, during the early stages of Hitler's rise to prurient power.<br /><br />There is something about wrapping a bit of fiction around facts and dates that vividly brings them to life. Which is exactly what Follett does, making this novel so very real and mesmerizing to me. I am old enough to read and totally relate to it, remembering first-hand accounts told to me by parents and relatives who lived through the WWII erea. This novel is poignant for everyone; especially since Follett will undoubtedly take you, as he has me, back in time as he captures and recreates the salient history lessons that we should never forget nor repeat.<br /><br />This review was written by June J. McInerney, literary blogger and book reviewer, and the author of \\"Adventures of Oreigh Ogglefont\\".
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This book was very good.  I happen to think Lee Child is one of the best mystery writers today.  The Reacher series is difficult to put down always.  Even though much of it is the draw of Reacher himself, Lee Child manages to do a great job with the overall theme of the book, making for intelligent reading.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is the best game that I have ever had and now that it is on the kindle I love it even more.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I wish the coins were unlimited and this was just supported by ads. I won't pay for extra coins, but the wait time isn't ridiculous. This game is very addictive; be warned!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love this app as far as the functionality, but a couple things are annoying. For one, if you have to close the puzzle you're working on it's a pain to get back to it later. You have to start all over at the home screen, decide whether to review or not, then you're at the puzzle home screen. You have to make sure you choose the right puzzle and settings (number of pieces, rotate off or on) then the game prompts you to continue the puzzle or start over. Bummer if you forget what puzzle you were on or the settings - everything has to match or you won't be prompted. Why can't it just take you right back to where you left off? It should prompt you right off when you launch the app to continue or start over.<br /><br />It does hang sometimes where it takes awhile to respond.<br /><br />Other than that it's a really fun game that is as challenging as you wish it to be...
1612933068|3.0|I didn't know until I finished this book that it was first published in 1963. Even though it's very old, the content in this book is timeless. However, I find this book very wordy and repetitive.<br />There's nothing new or interesting anymore once I understood the core idea. I could almost always predict what is it going be like in each subsequent chapter.<br /><br />The core idea, which can be grasped within the first few chapters, is that in order to manifest your desire, you must get into a sleepy, drowsy state, and affirm or visualize the result you want. Then your subconscious mind will bring it to pass.
B0087HT36U|5.0|A very fun puzzle challenge. More fun than Angry Birds because you can see what you are shooting at. Awesome!
B005IQZB14|4.0|Makes you feel as if you know the character in a personal connection manner.Chronology is documented in an interesting pathway which come and goes into the present.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I don't get Showtime, but wished I did when I kept hearing such great things about this show.  I'm not sure why it took so long for it to get to DVD etc., but I'm so happy I finally got to see it, and now I'm a little obsessed.  I'm actually really glad I got to see it the whole series at one time. I love spy stories, and this did not disappoint. By watching it over one weekend (I know kind of pathetic), it was like reading a suspense spy novel that I couldn't wait to finish, and then was so sad when it was over. The acting is fantastic. Claire Danes totally earned her Emmy.  I'm trying to decide whether to order Showtime and watch Season 2 this Fall...or to wait and watch it all at once again. I am leaning toward the latter.  As far as I'm concerned you can't go wrong with this show.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I totally love this game. You can play and put it down then go back without much effort. The only down side so far is waiting for more coins but that's hardly a big deal. The colors are pleasing and there is a bit of strategy involved. Download and enjoy!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just like sitting at the casino and I really don't mind waiting for coins b/c it keeps me from completely wasting all my time!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time.  On one level it's a great military story about a member of Seal Team Six, but don't be led astray. It is much more than that.  It is an uplifting human interest story about a man who overcame serious personal problems to become extremely successful and about an amazing wife who was such an important part of his life.  I have been recommending this book to everyone I know.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not much of a plot except alot of sex.  But as they say sex sells but it was not a book I would recommend.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is so helpful there is a calender, a note pad, and a check off list! When you check something off it stays on the list but is crossed out so you can uncheck it if you got the wrong thing or something.
B007T2XC7A|4.0|I really like buying MP3 downloads, and this is a good album.  Most the songs weren't as upbeat as her previous albums, but I really liked a couple songs on there that made the purchase worth it.
1609611543|4.0|Most of the material in the book I've seen before (including<br />reading some of the sources), but Davis does<br />a good job of summarizing the current case<br />against wheat.<br /><br />One thing that is good is his N=1 case studies from<br />his patients that he includes, showing the wild<br />range of maladies that could be linked to wheat.<br />My own N=1 was that my dad cut back on wheat a year ago<br />based on my urging, quit exercising, and lost 25 pounds<br />by the time I saw him again.<br /><br />The recipes are junk (I have high standards).<br />It's like being vegetarian and eating veggie burgers<br />rather than a good paneer masala. Just get a copy of<br />Julia Child's books or a good cookbook from a culture<br />that has better health than ours.<br /><br />I will give him a lot of credit for being one of<br />the few doctors to realize that \\"high cholesterol\\"<br />is a correlation/symptom and not really the cause of chronic<br />dietary caused inflammation. My doctor was telling<br />me that the cholesterol in my diet from eating meat and eggs<br />enters my bloodstream and clogs up my arteries (and \\"meat<br />is the main cause of cancer too\\")
B0063IH60K|5.0|good game.  like it a lot.  easy to play.  good format and display.  very fun.  i would recommend it to any one.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|helps pass the time in between task or appts. Easy for the kids and keeps them entertained .  just wish the coins would come quicker.
B002RKXO5E|5.0|Love the blu ray CD. The show was awesome!! i've heard their \\"back for good\\" song back in the 90s and saw them in a Tribute to Princess Diana 10th death anniversary and i fell in love with them especially Gary Barstow.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Great movie! My family and I really enjoyed watching it together! We would highly reccommend it to anyone who wants to see it!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a book that needed to be written.  I appreciate the author setting the record straight.<br /><br />I found it rather disturbing that we train our special forces so thoroughly and at a great expense to be stealth fighting forces and now because of politics they have to go in with bull horns.<br /><br />Good for anyone who wants to read a first hand account of the mission.  This author also tells quite a lot of autobiographical information which I found interesting, to know a bit about the inner workings of a man who would become a seal.
B008MZPVP4|5.0|Down IV Part I - The Purple EP is a six track, 33.18 minute release by the American Doom/Sludge/Stoner Rock supergroup Down from September 2012. It is the first in a series of EPs that collectively form a complete body of work known as Down IV but which each stand up as individual releases and which are all sequenced to show one particular element of the band's overall sound.<br /><br />If you are unfamiliar; Down's line-up features Pantera's Phil Anselmo on vocals, Corrosion Of Conformity's Pepper Keenan on guitar, Eyehategod's Jimmy Bower on the drums (who has also played with Pepper and Phil in C.O.C and Superjoint Ritual respectively), Crowbar's Kirk Windstein on guitar and now Crowbar's Pat Brudders on bass, replacing Pantera's Rex Brown who in turn had previously replaced Crowbar's Todd Strange.<br /><br />Generally, if you like any of the individual bands from which the band members previously come then there is a good (though not 100% guaranteed) chance that Down will suit your tastes, and they are definitely a band worth listening to for any fans on the Doomy, Stonery end of the Metal spectrum.<br /><br />Stylistically, The Purple EP concentrates on the heavier, doomier and most Sabbath-influenced aspects of the band's sound, ignoring the softer acoustic moments or bluesier leanings that intermittently appeared throughout their previous three studio albums. This is both the EP's greatest strength and weakness, as it delivers one complete set of matching tracks in a cohesive and uninterrupted whole, but could equally be accused of being samey or lacking variety if you weren't feeling particularly generous. There is nothing as fun as `Stained Glass Cross' or as evocative as `Jail' for example, but that shouldn't really be a problem when everything that is there is great in its own obvious way.<br /><br />Choosing highlights from a half-hour EP of similarly themed material is difficult although I would say that it was probably a good idea for the band to market the album using both `Witchtripper' and `Misfortune Teller' as they are definitely the most catchy and instant tracks on the EP. This is not to say however that the rest of the release is anything less than what a fan could want from Down in terms of quality. Every member puts in a good performance, the production job is charmingly raw and the whole thing just feels like pure-Down.<br /><br />Overall; as long as you already like Down, and aren't necessarily looking for a myriad of different styles and approaches then Down IV Part 1 - The Purple EP is everything you could ask for and you should probably check it out.t the album using both `Witchtripper' and `Misfortune Teller' as they are definitely the most catchy and instant tracks on the EP.

B0092MIHSY|5.0|According to an interview with Pitchfork, Jens considers this his first traditional album. As his previous releases such as \\"Nightfalls over Kortedala\\" were actually collections of Singles recorded over a long period of time. \\"I know What Love Isn't\\" is a much more cohesive album than any of his previous efforts for better or worse.<br /><br />With the exception of \\"The End of the World is Bigger than Love\\" all of these songs were recorded together and they share a very similar vibe. While he hasn't shaken off strings completely, there is much less bombast and stirring orchestras than before. He's more content to let the piano and some bass guitar carry a song. The melodies are all tight and well put together. They burrow into you after a few listens and really start to hit their stride.<br /><br />As others have stated, it takes a few listens for this album to really hit home. It's much darker and more depressing than previous outings so be ready for that. And while every song isn't a masterpiece (I generally skip Erica America when listening) there's songs on here I would rank among his best (The World Moves On and I know What Love Isn't).<br /><br />Jens is still the catchiest songwriter Sweden has ever given us and he's still got a wry sense of humor that comes out slowly. You'd be doing yourself a disservice not to pick this up.
B0083SBJXS|1.0|I excepted more action , it took about 47 mins or so to see any kinda of action, except the small part in the beginning. This movie isn't worth 20 dollars. it falls to my standards to 7.95<br /><br />The Avengers story line is so dry I had to turn off the movie five times before finish it, but that's just my opinion, it up to you to judge this movie.<br /><br />I think in the future I am not going by reviews in purchase a movie. I have not clue how 200 plus people rate this movie a 5.  unless they were in the movie or was told too by the studio to rate it high.<br /><br />I would save you money and rent it at the redbox for a 1.29.
B007PBKG5G|4.0|Alabama Shakes aren't trying to reinvent any genres, but they are injecting some Detroit Muscle into today's \\"white as snow\\" indie rock scene. There are some clunkers on this album but the standouts really take off on their own. The music here is mostly raw, and chugging soul/and rock songs that follow a familiar, but still compelling, quiet/loud/quiet/loud structure we've heard before. But really you're buying this for the lead singer because she's got pipes that blow the clouds off Ireland. Check out \\"Promised Land\\" or \\"I Found You\\" if you don't believe me.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|The entire series is compelling, and now it is on TV everyone already knows all about it. However, I thought I would throw my 2 cents worth in. Classic Fiction for sure. However, I am beginning to lose the plot a little toward the end there as the series is not as easy to read. This is because he has so many different characters, and they are on different time lines a bit too. But I am pursuing faintly, even though I feel slightly left behind! But no matter how far behind I get, I will keep reading to the bitter end. I hope there is a somewhat happy ending for my favorite characters.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|I didn't know this management system.<br />A month ago, I learned for the first time in the \\"Japanese translation\\".<br />Now, I'm enjoying the distinction between Original and \\"Japanese translation\\".<br />And I also feel pleasure to solve the puzzle.<br />For example.<br />Why begin with this writing? Why end up with this writing? Why do you not essential commentary in Choteau story?<br />I think people know that, would not be a puzzle. Those who do not know, as I got to enjoy a new puzzle, however.<br />I think that may solve the puzzle, it's part of the fun. Also, I recommend that you read this book as a novel.<br />This book is full of humor. So fun.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Very well written and completely grabs one's attention from the first to the last page! The story is a very enjoyable futurist adventure, presented with a compelling beady-eyed intensity.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|within the first chapter i was hooked. i cant seem to pry my eyes away from this suspense and drama filled, thrilling novel! The hunger games has become my #1 favorite since the harry potter and the twilight series.
B0099G7KDQ|1.0|Please don't buy this album.  I was incredibly disappointed with how this over-rated band re-created their last album...but this time with trite lyrics and the same formulaic pattern.  If you want a good band with great banjo, lyrics, and emotive content, reach for Punch Brothers.  They are a helluva lot better live too!<br /><br />Gosh, what a waste of money!
0307352145|5.0|This book did a great job about providing all kinds of information and facts about introverts as well as extroverts and how our world views these two personality types and also how that view has changed over the years.  I consider myself an introvert so I was very excited to read this book.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in introversion or anyone who knows an introvert.  It will help you to better understand them (or yourself!).  Easy to ready and facts are presented in a great story-telling manner.  I enjoyed this book immensely.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I first heard this song on a commercial for a new tv show.  After doing some research I've found out that it's been around for some time now.  I'm sorry I missed it!  It's a great song! You won't be disappointed if you liked the preview.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|As a FAN I never got to see them Live and could not wait for the Blu-Ray release in the USA, so I got the Import Blu-Ray a month ago and for something this old the Pic and Sound Quality are Amazing!..... Obviously not like a concert filmed today but if you get it you will not be disappointed.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|so far its an awesome game. but like the resof the games im afraid at some point ill be required to buy something. untilnthe ill play and have fun.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I have been reading Batman stories for 25 years (since I began reading comics in college). Frank Miller's \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\\" and his \\"Batman: Year One\\" are undeniably among the top ten greatest Batman stories ever told. Thus I was somewhat apprehensive of an animated adaptation of the Dark Knight Returns, as it is near and dear to my heart. I had very low expectations of the film, even though DC has been cranking out some really fine animated films over the past few years.<br /><br />I was very excited when I watched my Blu-Ray of this film the other day. It is one of the best film adaptations, animated or live-action, that I have seen. The core essence of Miller's book permeates this movie, missing only the strong political satire of the book. Peter Weller does a top-notch job portraying the 55 year old Bruce/Batman. Every action/fight scene was felt in my very bones. This film only makes me want to get my Absolute Edition of the book out and re-read it for the ump-teenth time.<br /><br />AND THIS FILM ONLY ADAPTS PART 1 OF THE BOOK! I can't wait for Part 2 to come out in 2013.<br /><br />If one were to own the quintessential Batman films, s/he would own the three Christopher Nolan films, along with the animated Batman: Year One, and this one.<br /><br />Be warned: Batman the Dark Knight Returns is rated PG-13. It is a brutal film...not intended for little kids. Heed the PG-13 rating. It is every bit the tough crime/action story that Frank miller portrays in his landmark book.<br /><br />This movie is AWESOME!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is addicting its realy fun and it gives a little bit of a challenge in later levels but over all its really fun and semi-easy
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Epic in scale & exquisitely wrought, Mumford & Sons sophomore release, Babel, does not disappoint.  Love abounds in many forms - in turn soaringly beautiful, achingly heartfelt, & profoundly moving, the Sons wear their hearts on their metaphoric sleeves with much candor & pathos.  At times jubilant, defiant & foot-stompingly giddy while in quieter moments forlorn & bereft, Babel successfully captures the revival tent spirit of M&S live, demanding your full attention while engaging both mind & heart.  This is an album best served whole, the sum being even greater than its parts.  Gentlemen of the Road indeed...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really liked the book but thought it was really<br />a guy thing. All veterans should read it,<br />I'm sure most would relate their experiences<br />when they served in the military.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|I alway enjoyed the book and still read it to my kids.  This deviates significantly from the book but isn't a bad movie.  I enjoyed the directors vision.  Its the kind of movie that you watch once.  Also, my kids didn't really like it.  They kept saying this didn't happen in the book.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love this show. My son and daughter in law got me very addicted to this show. It is one of the best shows out there.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great quality graphics; responsive. Good options. Lots of fun. You can put it down or close it out right in the middle of a game, come back and pick up right where you left off.  Use it all the time on both my Android and my Kindle Fire.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I really like this cover for the kindle fire.  It makes the kindle fire easier to hold and protects the device really well.  All while looking like a \\"real\\" book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|like the fact that you can leave the game but come back to start where you finished and even earn coins while you are away. loads of fun for all ages
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book really kept me guessing, but it was hard to put down! Just when you think you know what's coming next, Blake Crouch took off in another direction! Very entertaining and enjoyable. Highly recommended!
0792843584|5.0|The movie is gorgeous to behold and requires you to think. There's morality, action, romance, and every nuance of human behavior. Well worth watching.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game will never get old! it is a classic game that I love to play when all the new has worn off my other games. I would always recommend to spend the little extra to buy the full add free version. Because then you get to enjoy the game at its fullest level.
B0068ZG9ME|5.0|The entire series of \\"Modern Family\\" is one of the best sit-coms ever produced.<br />It involves a wonderfully acted cast of charactors that you feel an affinity to very quickly. The writers have scored a huge \\"10\\" of 10 in my book.
B008F5YDRI|3.0|This movie seemed to have a hard time deciding on the proper tone.  It was all over the place.  Kind of a waste of good actors, also.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is addictive! Be prepared to lose track of time while playing it. It sucks you in, in a wonderful way.
B005LAIHGI|3.0|I expected something really funny given all of the hype and my complete enjoyment of Sacha Baron Cohen's \\"Borat.\\" I watched this film with my husband and two adult friends While we all spent the time pleasurable, we agreed it was not as funny as \\"Borat.\\" Cohen started his film-making career with such an unbelievable film, that he has created a high-water mark for himself that he failed to reach in \\"The Dictator.\\"[[ASIN:B005LAIHGI The Dictator - BANNED & UNRATED Version]]
