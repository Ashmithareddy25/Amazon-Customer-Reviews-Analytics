B0009P5YXO|2.0|The tiny screw keeps coming out and it comes apart.  Had to repair 3 times within 1st week.  Can you say 'RETURN'?  I sure did!
B00C391Y3I|4.0|4.5 stars.  Ive been a fan since Point of Entry and saw them on Screaming for Vengeance tour.  Tipton is one of my favorite guitarists, and Halford is one of the best vocalists around.  My point of contention with this release is the production and quick cuts as so many have said. The sound is good, nice stage set, and good crowd though.<br />My point of contention with the band is Faulkner's leads and fills.  He doesn't play the solos the same way KK did; instead, improvising his own - which to the seasoned listener doesn't always fit, with me at least.  And then his fills, which KK never did live, either - are unnecessary.  And lastly, the antics of his crowd rallying when he should be picking, should be reeled in a bit.  I would guess alot of people in the audience thought they were getting KK.  And then given an unaccompanied guitar solo spot?  Gimme a break here! KK!!  KK!!  KK!!  I would have had serious reservations about touring without Mr Downing, but glad they did one more time, anyway.

B008D28HYS|5.0|I simply love this game. Cant seem to put it down. Very addictive. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves brain games!
B00CL151G4|5.0|We Loved this series. The on screen dynamic of Holmes and Watson is fresh and most enticing. Great to see a female Watson as companion. The stories are fresh and Moriarty is an interesting and refreshing twist on the usual villain.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Every step of the way rang true in this story, engaging me and pulling me along the trail. I'll never hike the PCT, but the steps of my life are not so different than the writer's.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Very fun and addicting! Was skeptical at first but it's challenging. It has many different levels and upgrades for weapons and armor.
1587613379|5.0|All I can say is, &#34;Damn, I should have written this book!&#34; But since I didn't, I'm making all my slut friends, and especially, my as yet unself- actualized slut friends, read this book. It says what I've been preaching all along.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book included things I've already learned but combined with humor and reminders, add in &#34;Just Do It&#34; and it made for great reading. Will highly recommend.

B00BIVN82M|5.0|I think this is one of his best CDs and heaven knows I've listened to them all.  He goes back to more of the Frank Sinatra classic sound with some wonderful songs he has written himself.  A must buy for any one who likes the music from the 40s and 50s.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|this is a must for any Eagles Fan.  Just wish the concert on the additional DVD was longer.  Purchased a 2nd copy just in case someone borrowed the 1st and didn't return.  He did and I'm still trying to get it back.

I can watch when it's convenient for me, not when cable tv finds time to aire certain of the series.  I recommend this to anyone who never got to wathc all of these series.  There's more truth to the aspect of relationships than I can explain.  One needs to watch it !!!! That includes men especially !!!

B0000266T2|5.0|there is something magic in thier voices.  As a young man I used thier singing as an example in a college class and intoduced a lot of young people to S&G.  I would recommend this seller, this product and this CD to everyone.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This sounds like such a cool gadget - to be able to stream video from my laptop or iPhone to the TV. But I was unable to get it to work with the Comcast router, which has a default setting to isolate access points so they cannot talk to each other. Googling around I discovered that most routers have a setting where you can Disable AP (Access Point) Isolation, but with the Comcast router this setting cannot be changed unless I pay Comcast $150 for a service tech to do it for me.
B008602KQI|5.0|Can't wait for the second movie.  This one was excellent, and played without a glitch from Amazon on my IPad.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|We love the new cast!<br />Pine, Quinto, Pegg and literally, every one of them are excellent!!!!<br />Can't wait for more movies!

B00A81MV3U|5.0|The day is going to come when every movie the Jennifer Lawerence is in will be a collectors item.<br />She is an excellent actress and it doesn't hurt that she is an amazing beauty too.
0061537969|3.0|This book was alright. I might have read it in my free time. I bought this book only for school. I believe it was an easy read and it had a good lesson. The condition of my book was great and also the speed of the shipping was great.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|I ordered this because of the price and i wanted my little people to finally see Star Wars.  But I forgot how Lucas changed up this version and has Greedo shoot first in the cantina scene. HAN SHOOTS FIRST!!!!!  That is what make Han awesome.  You don't mess with a classic.  If it wasn't for that - 5 stars.  So if you aren't a purist, but still love star wars, this is a great deal.
B000YAA68C|5.0|This is AMAZING and sad. I cry as I enjoy the movie! It makes you enjoy a really great love story!
B00571F26Y|5.0|The book delves into the truth about wheat and the government promoting it regardless of its harmful effects.  The author discusses the scientific evidence that proves the harm that wheat can cause.
B004SUSZB4|2.0|I loved loved the movie and tried this book. I usually find the books better. Here, it was slow and boring and quite different, and left it half way through.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. Ken Follett is an amazing author his is book is based on history and he did his research.
1554072840|5.0|My daughter loves this book for potty training. It is nice, shows the poo in the diaper and has really helped her! She really learned to sit after reading about how the girl SAT for a  long time! It shows all the body parts which was also nice to talk about.

B002ZG9968|1.0|This movie is so bad it is painful. It is a total  fantasy in the dumbest way. Even I, a lover of chick flicks was annoyed!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this.  Wanted something not sappy romantic, but not a thriller or detective novel.  This fit the bill, had me staying up late to get to the end.  Definitely recommend it!
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|This movie makes me cry with laughter every time I watch it! It is the silly stupid almost vulgar humor, but awesome!
B00E9P959O|3.0|Vapor Trails has never been one of my favorite Rush albums.  Sure, the mix was awful and distorted but my main beef was with the songs themselves.  \\"Earthshine\\" and \\"Secret Touch\\" were two songs I really liked.  \\"Ghost Rider\\" and \\"Nocturne\\" were okay.  To me the rest of the album was forgettable.  In my opinion Rush has never produced a truly awful album but Vapor Trails still doesn't represent their best work.  I suspect the band must have shared my lack of enthusiasm as only four songs were played any given night on the Vapor Trails tour, and this album hasn't been represented in concert since 2008.  So yes, it sounds a lot better but the songs are still iffy.  Back in their heyday, Rush albums were nice and short.  Kings, Hemispheres, Waves, Moving Pictures, Signals..all forty minutes in length or shorter and all great albums.  I would love another Rush CD with 40 - 45 minutes of great music an not fat.  Vapor Trails does have plenty of fat including what imho may be the worst Rush song ever, \\"Out of the Cradle\\".
B00BHASVQC|5.0|Season Two continues the excellent standard of entertainment set in Season One. I haven't read the book this series is based on, so all of the content was new to me. The story continues the efforts of Rob Stark to avenge the execution of his father, the journey of Jon Snow as a man of the Watch, the adventures of their two sisters, the Dragon Queen's trials and, in my opinion the most interesting of all, the development of the Lannister family runt, the dwarf, played superbly by Peter Dinklage. There are also several other new key sub-stories. The power of this series is in the extensive cast and this allows a lot of scope for killing characters off. This continues in Season Two but is offset by the inclusion of many new interesting characters. It all allows for the whole gamut the human condition to be explored. People make poor decisions and risk horrific consequences. There are battles, murders and betrayals. Alliances shift and new players emerge to replace those who fail. There is also a more notable shift to matters supernatural. Note that sex and language continue to be very strong but to me it is all riveting stuff. Some scenes are simply jaw dropping and more big developments are promised in Season Three!
B001DJLCRC|3.0|I purchased the DVD because it was recommended by others. It's interesting enough, but the season had no heroes - to me - and very few positive lessons.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|One of the best NIN in history. Love it. Very Good album. You MUST buy it. A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++. Yes it is that good.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|It's a cross between Grimm and Harry Potter. Not as good of a read as Harry Potter.  That's my opinion. It's just one of those books/ chronicles u will either like or can't get into at all.  I like books with a dark side and it had enough to keep my attention.  I was hoping the ending of the book made ya want to grab for the next but it didn't. The other books were still good though.
B005NQ5LQ4|3.0|This was a decent movie , but the first 2 movies of the series were MUCH BETTER!  In terms of content and movie flow.
0399255370|4.0|Gift for a friend....goes great with a box of crayons! :) just the cutest book ever. She loves it too!
B000NA2BEU|1.0|Veronica Mars has to be the silliest, sappiest series ever to pollute the airwaves. There is not one believable, sympathetic character in the cast. We ordered  the third season because we liked Jason Dohring so much in 'Moonlight', but he is a useless wet noodle in 'Veronica Mars'. We fast-forwarded most of this mindless rubbish, then threw the set in the trash & sent it to the county landfill. Would never watch anything else in which Kristen Bell has a role.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|I didn't start watching the show until the entire series was out.  Watching the first season, the show is a little slow to start, but it has to  build the framework the show needs.  The science fiction is implausible, but getting past that, the stories are pretty compelling.
B007HO392S|5.0|It is great to buy a CD where every song is better than the previous song.  I have played this CD so much that my kids know most of the lyrics.  It was definitely worth the price!

B004EBZX6W|4.0|This is a nice app to help you see the Wi-Fi signals that are within range, their strength and which channels they are broadcasting on.
B00D014E4Y|4.0|My boys have watched it several times now, and they really get into it. They laugh at the jokes and repeat them whenever they can. From my watching bits and pieces of it, it looks to be well done. It's quite a bit better than Atlantis, which we must have watched over a dozen times in the little theater at Legoland SeaLife Aquarium. As for it being a commercial for Lego, I don't overtly get that impression, and even my kids don't bug me to get Lego Batman sets. It's just a fun movie with action and laughs.
B00A3T5CGU|3.0|Does not really work on my Kindle Fire HD...for it to truly work good it would help to have a device with GPS - which it works great on my Android phone. Nice that you can download all the maps you would like or potentially may need to see.
B001P06GX4|5.0|As do we. It is a fun game but it really does take at least 3 players to make it interesting. Our grand-daughters are 6 and 13. The 6 year old never tires of it and the 13 year old - well, she's 13. That should say it all.
0451419243|1.0|I have to echo the other one star reviews.  Follett could not have written this. (If he indeed did then he should be ashamed of himself.)  Tell me this was written by a D student from an freshman English 101 class.
0761172726|5.0|His calendar offers 5 columns for each day of the month.  As a family of five, this gives a quick and easy glance of the daily activities and who is doing what. I have used his calendar for five years with the exception to the first 9 months of this year as I waited too long to buy it and it sold out.  My substitute calendar worked okay; however, as soon as the 2014 calendar can out I bought it as it is a 16 month calendar.<br /><br />I am SO HAPPY TO HAVE THIS BACK!
B00F35B8F8|2.0|I love the Star Trek franchise and was disappointed in how this one lacked creativity, acting was average and storyline wasn't interesting enough to se a sequel.

0385523394|3.0|Below is the post I put on my blog ([...]). But now that I've read others, I want to add that I don't think Piper Kerman was being narcissistic in writing this memoir. If I spent a year in prison, you better believe I'd be getting it down on paper. The book was not exciting or a page turner, but it did bring up good questions, which I think was her intention, if you read the Afterword in the paperback edition. Now on to the review:    Thanks to the Netflix series, most everyone knows that Orange is the New Black is about a middle class white woman who serves a short sentence in a women's prison. Of course, my reader OCD insisted I read the book first.    Piper Kerman recalls mostly her feelings throughout each instance in this memoir...duh, there's going to be nothing but a mess of feelings. She recalls both incidents involving her and incidents not involving her. Taken one by one, the incidents don't seem to stand out as exciting or amazing; however, as an overall piece, I believe Kerman accomplishes what she may have intended.    As each story and incident is told, they begin to layer upon each other until a picture of the American prison system comes into focus. I believe this is what Kerman wants readers to see: the humanity, struggling to stay human, behind bars. I am torn with this overall picture. The logical part of me says, \\"You screwed up, you're in prison, that's the way it works.\\" But my heart aches at the various ways in which prisoners are wrongly treated, abused, and taken advantage of by those looking after them.    Kerman also echoes that of another nonfiction book I reviewed in April called Shakespeare Saved My Life, by Laura Bates. (Bates teaches Shakespeare to hard core inmates and watches their lives turn around before her eyes.) In both books, the authors talk about the usefulness (or lack thereof) of prison activity. If a woman couriers drugs because she has no other way to make a living, you lock her up for a term of so many years, then release her, what do you think she will do once out? She's gotta eat somehow and she has no more skills now than she did before she was locked up. Why is the time spent in prison not being used to give the inmates skills and abilities to make an honest living on the outside? Why are the programs nonexistent or half-assed? This is a point upon which I can whole heartedly agree with both authors and have softened on my view of free education/college in prisons.    While the book was not a page turner in my opinion, I think Kerman asks the reader to observe these basic human needs through her experience and realize there are definite problems with the system, which are hurting very human people, cons or not. Sometimes her logic and stats are questionable...such as the fact that 435,000 people a year die from cigarettes in the US, while the toll for illicit drugs (which these prisoners are mostly in for) is 17,000. I would bet many more people are smoking cigarettes than shooting heroin throughout the nation, which skews the numbers in heroin's favor. Regardless, she does paint a picture that makes you think.
B00EZZ9W3C|5.0|I was introduced to the music of Gregory Porter about a year ago.  I am so happy hearing his music and I have purchased all 3! Gregory Porter is a breath of fresh air!  His sound is soulful, vibrant, refreshing; his lyrics and delivery are profound beyond his years.  I love me some Gregory Porter!!!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I pre ordered this book in January.  I was not disappointed in September.  I did not need to re read the Shining as I read it several times over the years<br />I tried to read slow to savor the book - but it didn't work<br /><br />Great story, true classic Stephen King, can't put it down and then when you're finished - happy to have read it and sorry there's no more to read<br /><br />I recommend this book - you will not be sorry - the story of Danny Torrance is a true hero's story!!
B00000J2PH|5.0|This album is my favorite!  I had the LP, the cassette tape and now finally the CD so I can listen to her music in my car.  The CD came in perfect condition and I will enjoy Listening to Tapestry for years to come.

1451695195|5.0|Too many people have near death experiences for it to be untrue. This book tells of a man who met his deceased sister that he didn't know. That seem very convincing to me.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|Enter a new world (or perhaps an ancient one come alive again) full of adventure! A thrilling epic tale with deep history and foundation to the story and characters. Compelling and riveting; thoroughly enjoyable! Can't wait to start Book 2!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|If you've seen my other gameloft reviews I compare the game to a console game. And this one is based of battlefield 1943.<br />Presentation: the graphics are epic. The graphics are as good as modern combat maybe better. The only problem is that there is no story. But the multiplayer makes up for it.<br />Gameplay: the gameplay is similar to modern combat except you have a choice between gyroscope controls or normal controls. What I prefer is normal controls because the gyroscope controls makes you move around which makes your character move which is pretty bad.<br />Multiplayer: FINALLY you don't need a gameloft account to play online. Thank you Gameloft.<br />Verdict: overall this is an epic game.<br />Rating: 9.0

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed this very much. It was so exciting and so full of suspense, it just kept me guessing and hoping, oh my gosh I have got to read the next one. I would recommend this book to anyone from 3rd grade and up it's an awesome read.
0425252868|5.0|It is the kind of story, when you are reading you hate to lay the book down, it is intriguing, and gives an inside to the German politics at the time.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I had no idea about the Orphan Train's at the turn of the century. Kline takes you back in history with the heroin of the story and then relates her story to modern day situations.

B0068RHGJM|5.0|This band just gets better. A fantastic album and what a fab idea to have an instrumental version of all songs. Not as 'metal' as other albums but far more mature and although their grasp of descriptive English is not perfect, it's way better than my grasp of descriptive Finnish! Great album but maybe not for all Nightwish fans.
0618918248|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for at a great price! I would most highly recommend if you're in the market

1250030951|5.0|I feel like I've been waffling on whether or not to read this book for years now even though it's only been a few months. The thing is, I really enjoyed the first half of Rainbow Rowell's [[ASIN:0452297540 Attachments]] I really, really did. And then I was summarily disappointed with the second half. I don't know if it was me or the fact that I read it immediately after giving birth and that just rarely ever works out for me or what. But the direct result was that I stayed away from [[ASIN:1250012570 Eleanor & Park]], despite it's adorable cover and quirky premise. And I was apparently still shell-shocked enough that I was going to just go ahead and pass on FANGIRL if it wasn't for a friend's enthusiastic review some weeks back. I thought I was just sort of waltzing around lacking the Rowell gene, when in fact I simply hadn't found my gateway book. And now I'm kind of having a hard time imagining my reading year without this book. This hilarious, complicated book that induced all the feelings in the general vicinity of my heart.<br /><br />Cath doesn't do social situations. Outside of her twin sister Wren and her dad, few people have been able to penetrate the force field of solitude with which she surrounds herself. Even her high school boyfriend Abel was really just a placeholder, a nice idea of a boyfriend. But there has always been Simon. And Baz. Ever since they were kids, Cath and Wren have teamed up to write Simon Snow fan fiction. And when the more vivacious Wren's social life took flight, Cath soldiered on alone. Dedicated to the fictional world of Simon Snow, her followers grew to number in the tens of thousands and sating their voracious appetites became a full-time job. Which is why college seems to be getting in the way so much. Having to make small talk with her roommate Reagan and Reagan's kinda sorta ex Levi sends Cath into paroxysms of exhaustion. Not to mention her demanding class schedule and not knowing where the cafeteria is and worrying about leaving her dad all alone at home to fend off loneliness. Cath is a basket case. Fortunately, her roommate can read the writing on the wall and stages an intervention. And thus begins Cath's tentative exploration of life off the page. But when Wren's life threatens to run off the rails and their long-estranged mother re-enters their lives, Cath's only refuge remains with Simon and his sometime nemesis, sometime partner Baz.<br /><br />I fell on page one. It was laughable how fast I fell. And I'm not even a little bit hesitant to admit it, because I laughed and giggled and gasped my way through this absolutely delightful book. And not just your run-of-the-mill out loud laughing either, but the silent smiles that slowly grow until they take over your whole face and you have to stop and just let the moment happen and savor it before continuing on. Those moments occurred basically any time Cath was thinking, speaking, writing, or sitting in the same room with Levi. Honestly, the boy deserves a moment of silence all his own. I don't remember the last time I grew so fond of a nice guy so fast. In fact, here is one of my favorite Levi moments:<br /><br />***<br /><br />\\"I just want to know--are you rooting for me? Are you hoping I pull this off?\\"<br /><br />Cath's eyes settled on his, tentatively, like they'd fly away if he moved.<br /><br />She nodded her head.<br /><br />The right side of his mouth pulled up.<br /><br />\\"I'm rooting for you,\\" she whispered. She wasn't even sure he could hear her from the bed.<br /><br />Levi's smile broke free and devoured his whole face.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I will never tire of Levi's smiles. But as smitten as I was, the focal center of the book remained Cath for me. And I'm so glad Ms. Rowell kept the whole thing so tightly focused on Cath's struggles, both with the world inside her head as well as with the world around her. Initially, I was wary of the actual Simon Snow excerpts (to say nothing of Cath's fan fiction sections). But Rowell surprised me with her deft interweaving of Cath's own life and the life she breathed into Simon and Baz and the whole Watford School gang. To be perfectly frank, she surprised (and wowed) me with the level of nuance on the grand scale. And before long, Cath's dorm room felt like home to me, felt disturbingly like my own dorm freshman year, papered with clippings and memorabilia declaring who I had been, threaded through with anxiety and hope for who I would become. I knew who Cath was. I could see her with perfect clarity. Last of all, one of the most visceral moments in the book, in which Cath confronts the woman who gave birth to her and abandoned her ten years later.<br /><br />***<br /><br />\\"You don't just leave somebody alone in a hospital,\\" Cath said. It came out aflame.<br /><br />\\"Wren's not alone,\\" Laura said sternly. \\"She has you.\\"<br /><br />Cath jerked to her feet and swayed there. Not Wren, she thought. I didn't mean Wren.<br /><br />Laura wrenched her handbag straps higher. \\"Cather--\\"<br /><br />\\"You can't leave like this--\\"<br /><br />\\"It's the right thing to do,\\" Laura said, lowering her voice.<br /><br />\\"In what alternate universe?\\" Cath felt the rage burst up her throat like a cork popping. \\"What sort of a mother leaves the hospital without seeing her kid? What sort of a mother leaves? Wren is unconscious--and if you think that has nothing to do with you, you are skimming the surface of reality--and I'm right here, and you haven't even seen me for ten years, and now you're leaving? Now?\\"<br /><br />\\"Don't make this about me,\\" Laura hissed. \\"You obviously don't want me here.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm making it about me,\\" Cath said. \\"It's not my job to want you or not want you. It's not my job to earn you.\\"<br /><br />\\"Cather\\"--Laura's mouth and fists were tight--\\"I've reached out to you. I've tried.\\"<br /><br />\\"You're my mother,\\" Cath said. Her fists were even tighter. \\"Try harder.\\"<br /><br />***<br /><br />And that is how it's done. That is how you secure my everlasting loyalty for a character. She's so strong in that scene. Her fists are tighter. And I love her so much for saying what she needed to, for getting it out. I loved every word of FANGIRL. As my friend Laura says, some books move in.

1400069289|4.0|Lots of good ideas. Just as with anything, one has to want to make changes. One of the better advice books.
B00004R997|5.0|This is an old-fashioned treat for someone who remembers this from when he was a child.  If you're an oldster...you will love this !
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My husband and I watched it together and loved it, ready for season 3 catch-up too!  Give the series a try you won't be dissappointed.
B000WTNCQI|5.0|First, let me start by saying that The Joshua Tree is one of my favorite albums.<br /><br />I purchased a copy on Vinyl because I've heard that it has a warmer sound.  My wife owns a copy of the remastered version on CD and I must say that the vinyl version is comparable.  It has a much warmer sound.  The packaging and quality of the pressing is fantastic.<br /><br />If you've never heard the remastered version, there are a few tracks that it makes a real difference on.  With or Without You is cleaned up and they fixed the volume issue from the original release.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got this for my 5 year old who loved the movies. He loves it, it does take a while to load.
B005MYWZKM|5.0|I bought this digitally and then on vinyl later.  The warmth of the vinyl version is spectacular. The pressing is on the thicker vinyl and it was very high quality.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|What a fantastic premise and an all too scary but plausible scenario.  Abuses of power, destruction of the planet, fighting for survival. Oh, how the human spirit endures, longing for connections,purpose and meaning.
1439152810|3.0|I have read a couple of her other books and I found this one to be a little disappointing.  I enjoyed the book but I think it could have been made a little bit more believable and a little bit less confusing.<br /><br />I passed this on to another reader and when she asked me if it was good, I hesitated before I said yes.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I think I stayed up until 2:30 AM on a work night just to get to the next chapter... then the chapter after that... this was a fast read.
B00F2362IE|1.0|caused my kindle to freeze two days in a row...had to do a hard restart to get it going.  terrible app and very disappointing for my grandson.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A good, quick and easy read.  I wanted to read this before watching the movie with some girlfriends.  It def. grabs you from the get-go with the controversial relationship between the main character and her husband and rolls on from there.  You root for her to become &#34;whole&#34; throughout the book and finally let herself be happy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! it is so much fun! this is an amazing game! Everyone should at least try it once!
1451695195|5.0|Alexander was more successful than other reporters in discussing this intensely personal experience. His ability to coalesce his scientific background with his emotional journey into a digestible format was fascinating. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read since he crosses every literary genre. Could it be fiction, Non-fiction, Mystery, Adventure,Documentary?
B00ECLU346|3.0|First one was the ansolute best...last two minutes of this one was the best part .. If there is a IV I'll skip it
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Ah, Steven King always mentions another book or character in each book. He never leaves you wondering about a character, you soon learn that they will show up later. Doctor Sleep is just a continuation of \\"The Shining\\", just years later. It is another one of his books that you just can't put down[[ASIN:1476727651 Doctor Sleep: A Novel]]
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey has the inimitable Maggie Smith as it's matriarch, a whole cast of intriguing characters and a few characters we love to hate!  This all makes for a  wonderful series and the fact that it moves so quickly adds to its appeal! The Brittish have another hit to their credit and I give them five stars!  Highly recommended!
B00B9E29CI|4.0|Easy to read examination of educational advantage and disadvantage.<br />True stories of new and working approaches, and their heroes.<br />Interesting for parents and educators.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Don't be scared off by the haters, this is a great album.  Like several other NIN albums, at first you may be turned off by some of the new sound, but give the entire album a listen through.  The 'Disc 2' Tracks at first were not to my taste at all.  Later on I was listening to the whole album set and let these play through in context, and everything just clicked.  Now they're among my favorites!  If you like NIN, this is another really good album to add to your collection.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I was waiting and waiting to have all the movies together so I could watch whenever we wanted.  LOVE IT!!!
B0002NRRUQ|5.0|it is awesome was not any less of disappointed keep up the good work thanks will keep on ordering if I have to
B004SIP6BI|5.0|Love the characters, the music, Johnny Depp, and of course, the Chocolate.  Makes you feel like living in a small town in Europe.
B00E9P959O|4.0|The 4 stars is for the album musically, the remix is worth 4.5. This remix breathes fresh life into what should have been the band's glorious return after the 6 years from Test for Echo. The original mix was awful but at the time I guess fans were just pleased/relieved that there was still a Rush to listen to.<br />This mix put things right. Other reviewers have commented that it lacks punch or some of the original emphasis has been lost. Having had a listen I can see their point, but, I think this is a well balanced remix and while the odd compromise might have been made, the pluses far outweigh any negatives. It is light years ahead of the original mix and doesn't make your ears bleed. Good job. Incidentally, this is not available for release til October 7th in the UK but I found the MP3 version available in my cloud ready to download this morning after pre-ordering a couple of days ago - bonus :-)
0316286850|5.0|My daughter is interested in makeup and stage makeup so this is the perfect beginner book to inspire her and give her good tips about not breaking the bank with expensive makeup.
B002DQLGHU|4.0|This Movie is great for fans that already read the book. Those Who didn't read the book might find it boring.
B0013GLE4Q|5.0|Love old Avril and new Avril - she is the voice of her generation.  Wish she had come around when I was younger :-)
B00CCEHYO2|5.0|While I don't find Scale the Summit quite as revolutionary as Animals As Leaders, they are still lots of fun to listen to.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I really like this type of puzzle game and have purchased several of them.  The visuals are good. The animations are a little slow on the larger puzzles but that could be my phone.  I like the way the controls are implemented but they do cause me to press the wrong button sometimes.  Because of that I would prefer an option to completely turn off error tracking and provide an Undo button.  If it provided that and it didn't make you post a review to unlock extra levels, I would probably give it 5 stars.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|I liked this book as I do all of David Baldacci's books.  It was a page turner and I hated to put it down.
B00000JZIK|5.0|I liked this movie.  I was reading a true crime book and in it.....they mentioned that the accused read this book.  I wanted to see it and tie it into the book I was reading.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this season of Dexter. So much anticipation and uncertainty. The season finale really leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat just dying to know what's in store for the final season. I definitely recommend this series as a whole. It is amazing.
B001B51B9M|5.0|Excellent service! Excellent product!<br />What can I say...when you're good you're good!  How can you get any better?  Nuff said!
B006X5L6VS|4.0|Great little app. I haven't used it a lot but it does what it was said to do. I'm having a little difficulty with the naming of the stars right now but I think it will get easier with use.
B001CDWFPC|3.0|I ended up returning it. I had problems with it on my ipad so returned it and will continue to use my NIV
B009T3AE1Y|3.0|WOW!  I watched it three times just to see if I missed something.  It is an interesting experiment in film making, with almost the entire movie taking place inside and around a limo. It was really fairly mediocre.  Too bad for Robert Pattinson who played his role well, but couldn't save the movie.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Chose this rating because diction often blurry, bad language gratuitous.Generally  All actors are sujperb, plots are in teresting filming great
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I absolutely loved this book. I've probably read the series about three times now and this is my fourth time. Clary is so strong-headed and stubborn and Jace and Simon crack me up. I could feel for these characters and it's almost as though I was transported into the shadow hunter world and experiencing it with the New York Institute crew. Unfortunately, I only gave it four. One, was because I read the prequel to this series and fell in love with it. When I came back to reading this series again, I found that it was too fast-paced, and although I experienced the feeling, it was too brief and I didn't have enough time to care as much as I should have. Although this is only the first book, I feel as though perhaps it should be more steady paced and not rushed. In all actuality, I give this book a 4.6. It doesn't make me love it any less though :3
1400067820|4.0|I am a third of the way through and mostly enjoy the book and find the premise interesting and important.  It is obvious though that the author thinks a lot of himself and can be pretentious.<br /><br />The premise?  How some things develop that are made stronger when attacked, they are Antifragile.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book was great - I couldn't put it down. It gave me nightmares and made sleep difficult.  I'd say that is a success.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love how this is a \\"complete\\" book....It comes round full circle and does not leave you hanging in the end.  Like \\"The Shining\\" , once I picked it up, it was almost painful to put it down to do mundane things (like eat, or work or sleep).<br /> Great job, Mr. King!!! Thank You!!!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I don't think it even has all words in the English world!!!!! I have a DICTIONARY AND THESAURUS!!!!! Pretty cool,huh?
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Kindle was being charged by a charger I already had thinking that it would work.  Our Kindle went completely dead so I called Amazon to see if it was broke/fried. I was asked about the charger and they sent me the 'amazon charger' and it worked like a miracle!!!
B009NQLT0M|5.0|I've been told by a few tech guys that a silent fan is impossible and not to expect much out of this. I didn't use it on a computer, but as fresh air supply into a paintball mask. Being only inches from my ears, noise was a HUGE concern of mine. This fan blew my expectations out of the water, essentially silent operation, good airflow, and excellent build quality. I can't recommend this brand enough. To top it off it came with a boat load of accessories for installation and adaptation to various connections.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|I have always love this movie, my husband bought these as a birthday gift and now I can see when I want.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like the.locations because it describes the movie perfectly. Its also very addicting. I cant stop playing it lol :)
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I looked in a History of Movies. In This Movie Erroll Flynn is great. I like the version more than dth modern versions!
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|This app kept locking up on my tablet and phone. When it did work I liked it, but it caused more problems than it helped.
B004AHNIGM|4.0|This effort by Greg Allman sounds good the first time and It grows on you more and more with each listen.  Worth listening to it the whole way through a few times to fully appreciate.  Good for a long relaxed drive. Listened to it on a ride from Jacksonville to Fort Myers then again from Jacksonville to Macon, GA.  Stopped at the &#34;Big House&#34; in Macon while I was there.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|We are having a lot of fun with this game my wife and I play and so do the grand kids. It can also be played with one player against the AI but what fun is that? It works fine on my Galaxy S 3 phone and my Galaxy tablet.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is just fantastic.  Starts off at the perfect level and slowly but steadily builds up your language skills.  I use it every minute I can to learn German, and I have found it the best method so far to pick up the basics quickly and I assume it will continue that way as I work my way up through the levels.  Get it!
B00ECLU346|2.0|The first was best, the third just that, third rate.  Not particularly entertaining  at all. Reworked theme from first movie.
B00FFVML74|5.0|This was amazing. Really took me into the story and characters. I cried,smiled, cried again. I felt so much a part of Broadchurch, all their pain and secrets were told so you thought this was your town. Why can't American TV produce such outstanding shows? They didn't sensationalize the happenings they made them real. Bravo BBC, once again an excellent show.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Wonderfully transparent story of what the foster system is like then and now from an inside perspective. A beautiful example of how friendship can span generations with a common bond.
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|Describe nicelly and great sence of humor the problem in humen relationships Asperger syndrom people are facing. Highly recommanded and fun to read.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I have not viewed this DVD yet but my son has and he said it was terrific, Thank you so much
B0082SU98U|3.0|The GLAD GAME is one that should be paid forward once people learn how to play it, it would be my pleasure to teach my sons, even though they are 27, 21 and 13.  I'm glad this book came to my hands in this moment .<br />Im convinced this is the beginning of something good and sweet.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Dredd greatness lies in its simplicity. As seen in some other reviews, Dredd is Die Hard meets Robocop in a action film that refuses to let up its pace for its relatively short hour and a half run time. The movie is refreshing in that there's no filler, no attempts at shoehorning in a romance or character moments that don't quite belong. Instead Dredd goes for a well shot, well executed action movie with all of the fat trimmed, and what's remaining is pure fun. I'm not typically an action movie fan due to the lack of plot and characters, but Dredd does what it needs to with its characters and nothing more, focusing the rest of their resources on making an outstanding action movie. Highly recommended.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome game. It's fun and kid friendly. The only thing you need to watch is you can buy more coins and gems via a debit/credit card. Other than that it's a pretty cool game.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have used SwiftKey for a long time now and it easily has the best prediction service going. Also the &quot;useful&quot; feature set beats every other keyboard hands down.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Excellent book typical Stephen King keeps you wondering the whole book and always has a good ending. Long winded when he's thanking people ha ha
0374533555|5.0|This book was hard to put down, very well written, and it obviously has had a large impact based on how often I see it referenced in other writings, blogs, etc. I plan on re-reading it very soon. Highly recommended.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I've heard many conflicting reviews about this movie.  I loved this movie.  The premise was slightly different than what we've seen in other zombie movies and Pitt was able to carry the storline very well.
B00FF56IR4|5.0|I have only watched the pilot of this show so far. I was not planning on watching it at all since I am not usually all that interested in super hero fare but Joss Whedon's involvement convinced me to give it a shot. The man has had enough hits, and enough success, to know that it is not merely a matter of luck. He's got real talent and I enjoy his sensibility immensely. I was not disappointed in this show at all. Quite the opposite. I decided to watch the first episode to give it a shot but now, after only a single episode, I am hooked.<br /><br />The show is full of Whedon's trademark wit. When Phil steps out of the shadows and says \\"Sorry, that corner was so dark I couldn't resist. I think there's a bulb out or something\\" I knew immediately whose universe I was in. The writing on the show is easily three steps above most of what you are used to seeing on television. It is still too early to get a full sense of all the characters but from first impressions it definitely seems like Whedon has managed to produce another great ensemble cast. That is one of the things I most appreciated about his prior work.<br /><br />There is also a really engaging story. I have a feeling there is some background mythology that I am not entirely following. I have never really been into comic books or super heroes but, in a way, I almost think it might be better that there are things I am not in on. It creates more mystery. I have no idea where the plot is heading but I am definitely looking forward to finding out. I recommend giving this show a shot even if you are not ordinarily into super hero movies or shows. You might be pleasantly surprised.
B00915G6MG|5.0|One of the best shows on television. I love having all the seasons, this way, I can watch them at my leisure, and not miss any!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I thought this was a little pricey but my son really loves it. He watched in awe as his older brother helped put it together then he played, played, played!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This is an excellent app.  I read it everyday. Try it and you will not regret your decision. Do it now!
B003L20IHO|4.0|I enjoyed this movie because of its complexity. I wasn't sure what to think of the main character's mental state, but Zac was convincing in his acting and I loved the story arc and how it directed everything toward healing. Good movie.
072325804X|5.0|Growing up my mom used to read these to my sister and I and now my sister will be a mom soon I decided she needed a copy too since I wasn't parting with mine. Mine is the soft cover version but i think the hard cover is much nicer and durable. My sister was really happy to recieve this book and can't wait to share the stories with her child when it is born.
B00CL151G4|5.0|We truly enjoy this series.  The cases are full of interesting tidbits, and the chemistry between Sherlock and Miss Watson is amazing.  A must see!
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Haven,t bought anything from Eric in many decades thought I would take a chance. Glad I did. I got this along with another CD which I also love but I have played this a lot more.What does that say . Thank you Eric
0399157565|5.0|A book i really enjoyed. Patricia Cornwell 's books are ones I can always count on for thrills , a gripping story  , and a all around good read. Her books arrive and the first one to the  book gets to read it first. Both my husband and myself enjoy her books.
030759565X|5.0|I am a long time reader of Deb's Smitten Kitchen blog so I was one of the many adoring fans waiting to get my hands on the copy of her new cookbook. After much anticipation and then even more cooking, I can tell you that this book will be on my shelf, splattered and dog-eared, for years to come. Just like her blog, Deb focuses on (mostly) unfussy, seasonal, and above all delicious recipes. Most of us have become used to eating with our eyes first and you will find a lovely photo accompanying every single dish. Another thing that I really appreciate is a separate section devoted to vegetarian main courses. Unlike other cookbooks where I find a few recipes I like but many more that I have no interest in making, I am tantalized by every page of this book. Nearly everything I've made (over 40 recipes now) has been stellar. A few of the stand outs for me include:<br /><br />* big cluster maple granola<br />* avocado tartine with cucumber and sesame seeds<br />* mushroom bourguignon<br />* roast chicken with grapes, olives and rosemary<br />* s'more layer cake<br />* apple cider caramels (which can also be found on her blog)<br /><br />I wasn't as impressed by Jacob's Blintzes or the New York Casserole, but the misses are few and far between. I highly recommend this cookbook for anyone's library.
B00006AW2O|5.0|I've been a fan for fifty years. This is still my favorite album.  The Muscle Shoals Blues influence and the harmonica lines just Knock me out.. Recommend it to anyone who loves the blues.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Great show, season three was good, but i feel ike they need to do something really drastic season 4 to keep me interested. overall awesome show, hopefully it doesnt turn into dexter.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Always been a big Star Trek Fan.  Really like the new characters, and the return to the beginning.  Waiting for Star Trek III
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I really like this game. just make sure you have a good online connection. its easy and keeps you interested the whole way through.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great acting, great sets, fantastic story line.This is great work by PBS.  Keep up the good work, and looking forward to season 4!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|If you're into keeping a check on your health - this and the several other withings tools such as BP checker, scales, etc all combine seamlessly to give you a good overview of your health on the app and the website - improving or otherwise. Go for it .
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Great knife, I took it camping and split wood with it and it retained its edge.  The kydex sheath is nice but i will get the tek lok belt loop.  The scales are fine and I dont see a need to upgrade at this time.  Its a great tool and I highly reccomend.  amazon shipped it fast too.
1476727910|5.0|very interesting!<br />i enjoyed reading this book and have recommended it to my friends. this is science fiction which could (nearly) be true!
B000UPSKO8|5.0|This is a winner ! Can't stop watching it.  Anna and Elina sing so beautifully and sometimes together that my heart reaches up to heaven.  All four parts are also together at times.  This is not only good, this is a fun fun gala.
0061537969|5.0|i love this book! one of my all time favorites. beautiful and very moving story. i can highly recommend it.
B00243FQFA|5.0|I love this series! I was so disappointed when they took this show off the air. Now, I can watch any episode any time.
B008Y212PI|5.0|stretch your mind!  very fun!  even when you are forced to guess; it makes you think.  got to get. back to it
1401938906|4.0|This is a great book to share with the people around you. I am a Pilates instructor and incorporated this book into my classes for 8 weeks. I asked them to buy the book and then each week we focused on a different experiment. It is almost more powerful doing it in a group since everyone shares their experiences and it helps with the people who are usually skeptical about doing this sort of work.  You will enjoy it and have fun while learning to manage your energy.
1587143879|5.0|I took the test after reading the  2 book and passes with no problems.<br />Great examples and very thorough knowledge base.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Amazing. Love Gillian Flynn. This novel was a bit different from her others- there was actually a character I liked rather than a bunch I despised. As usual though, Flynn kills it! Amazing read. Can't wait for what's next.
B0054PSY2W|5.0|Loved this film don't hesitate to buy it well worth it the picture is superb and the film is so excellent good acting and funny moments and the songs in it are so good also with the American version you get some extra's which the u.k version not any extra's what so ever why I don't know so I ditched the u.k one and decided to buy the American one as its region free so glad I did wicked film, well that's my opinion
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Rodriguez is a poet in every sense of the word.  His &#34;voice&#34;, both literally and figuratively, is one that needs to be be listened to.  It is a shame that it took this long for us to hear it.
B000C20VPA|5.0|I absolutly love this movie always have always will. The cast is amazing and the story unfolds in such an amazing manner that I feel involved.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is one of the great mystery movies of all time and it is all true!  Rodriguez is one of the great unsung heroes of the 80' music scene and unbeknownst to most, he sparked the downfall of apartheid in South Africa.  It'a amazing how a song can change the world.  It's a brilliant movie!
B00003CXWV|5.0|Great movie never disappoints and Im glad to add it to my massive movie collection. If you have never seen it you must.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Fun game. It makes you think but not too much. Just enough to keep it your attention. Also it can get addictive :-)
B006LSZECO|1.0|I tried to get interested in it, but, good grief!  What an odd concept.  They are all more than a little off balance.  It was not a satisfactory ending.
B0091THRCU|5.0|I loved the slimness of the pouch. So much that I ordered the suede one a few days after receiving the black. It is classy and tastefully designed.  I like the way the pull string snaps back aided by elastic and magnet. Solid product.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Just plain good - if you like this group you will like this CD - mostly dark and serious music
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Loved it then, love it now.  Timeless classic, can't wait to share it with my kids when they are old enough!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazing story. I couldn't put it down. One of my favorite books ever. This is going to be the next big thing.
B000S5ASM2|5.0|One of my all-time favorites and well produced and performed. Would recommend it highly for anyone who loves Dvorak or this piece in particular.
B0014BY72Q|4.0|Logan's Run is fun... I've always liked it.  In many ways, like the mostly subliminal references to gay rights, it was ahead of its time.  (It suggests a future in which people have sex with strangers casually on an open \\"exchange,\\" with no implied moral judgement -- the protagonist gets offers for sex from men as casually as from women.)<br /><br />The first third or so of the movie is great.  The visual effects are downright silly, even for the '70s, but the story is engaging and moves at a good pace.  Then it starts slowing, and around halfway through, falls into a dramatic rut and fails to recover its momentum or make much sense from that point on.  (The part with the \\"last old man\\" who has somehow been surviving and bumbling along for decades on his own, is particularly dull and difficult to watch.)<br /><br />The premise is good though, and I'd love to see it remade someday.<br /><br />It deserves three stars but I'm giving it four out of nostalgia.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Its my favorite show love all the  actors and interaction between each character in the show. Look forward to season 11
B0087IT8FK|5.0|WHAT A PLEASURE TO FINALLY SEE AN INTELLIGENT, INSPIRING FILM!<br /><br />I FOUND THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION SO GOOD THAT AFTER A WHILE I NEVER REALIZED THAT I WAS READING THE DIALOGUE AS THE ACTORS WERE SPEAKING FRENCH.  IT JUST FLOWED SO NATURALLY.<br /><br />THE ACTORS WERE NOTHING LESS THAN SUPERB!<br />WHAT A HEART WARMING STORY - ONE THAT I HAVE WATCHED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE RECEIVING THE DVD.<br />LOVED IT!!!!
0743297334|3.0|I read this after hearing so much from my friends....sad to say I didn't like it. I do like the classics but this one didn't hit home with me. I felt like it was just a bunch of men fighting over a girl they all loved but couldn't get.
B00BDSRER0|5.0|I really loved this album my favorite songs on it were &#34; Trying To Be Cool&#34; and &#34;Entertainment&#34; I also really liked &#34; SOS in Belair! Great album BUY IT
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Life Altering - Watch this film and be moved from a couch potato to an environmental activist - A wake-up call to all humanity!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book will offend &#34;Christians&#34; who think of the Bible as some kind of magic talisman, never actually reading it closely and critically.<br /><br />However, &#34;Zealot&#34; is well within the mainstream of academic thought on the life and times of Jesus. Those who disagree with Aslan will find ample support and references in notes supplied by Aslan himself.<br /><br />This book should be required reading in any university course on church history. As one who has spent a lifetime in search of the historical Jesus, I can say that Aslan has answered all my questions, though not in a way that I can accept without raising many new questions!
B0009UC810|5.0|Must have if you're into blues and comedy. Excellent cameos by great artists of that genre. Love this movie. A Halloween costume idea. Just need a taller and skinnier counterpart!
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I have been a fan for a long time. This new album did not disappoint me. The more I listen to it the more I like it just like his other albums. Thanks Trent!
B000UGG3A0|5.0|Not much more to say really than that another excellent album by the Dropkick Murphys. Have ALL of their albums. Absolutely love the songs.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I am so thankful I got this book.  I've given it to two of my family members. Such a fun way to be assured that you are loved by the Universe.
0790729407|5.0|Great depiction of Michael Collins and company. Liam Neeson bad ass as usual. Great acting, powerful story. Love the movie!
0143123173|4.0|Like the demeanor of Walt Longmire!<br />Good storyline & perfect characters for this series<br />recommend this for all mystery fans
B004EPYZTE|5.0|Don't forget Conan was a comic series and this movie is somewhat of a remake, then again not somewhat of a remake. The great Conan and his adventures. Love this movie as well as the older two. Hope there's more to come.
B00F91H666|4.0|It was better than I expected.  I liked the occasional humor as well as the slightly different view on the zombie virus/epidemic that many movies take.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Finally was able to enjoy this movie and get all the jokes and puns from the character's quotes from this movie. Great storyline.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Very engaging and kept my mind thinking!  It was similar to sudoku but but counting tiles instead of putting numbers in!
B0094WK9GU|5.0|good finale mix right before their seperation. who's going to save the world tonight??? also loved the accapella of the florence and the machine song.
1878424114|5.0|I have been organizer for a &#34;law of attraction&#34; book discussion meetup group in my area and everyone has thoroughly enjoyed discussing this work by Deepak Chopra. It seems very simple, but the ideas are true and relevant in people's everyday lives.
B003NX75B8|5.0|Love it! The gay characters in this book were well scripted and it's great to see fiction giving voices to to the community rather than them always being side kicks. Also the book was just good.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Can't wait for the movie!  I hope the first movie is done well enough that the trilogy gets made. Awesome !
B004DLPXAO|4.0|What can I say that others haven't? This app works well. I like how it gauges and displays the time left in each chapter. I also like how that time is continuously updated (like when I stop reading for a bit and then resume). I suppose I mostly appreciate the percentage of the book already read. Really gives me a true location to where I currently am in the book.. this feature also estimates the time to the end when I open a book that I have already read, basing its estimate on how long it took me the last time to read cover to cover. Not necessarily needed info but nice to know what I average from book to book. This app will stay on my RAZR Maxx until I buy a Kindle Fire later this fall.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Those flying pieces were just too much for me. I know it's comics but for some reason little micro jets lifting odd shaped stuff at high speed. Come on.
0525478817|5.0|The author wrote this book from the point of view of a teenage girl with cancer who faces many regular struggles of being a teenager, plus, the additional struggles of being a teenager with cancer. There is plenty of humor and realistic dialogue but also the sadness of reality for this teenage girl and her family and friends. This goes down as one of my all-time favorite books!! I don't read that many books but I couldn't put this one down!
B00594XOZU|2.0|I used to use this app 24/7 but now it doesn't let me log in anymore. FIX FAST, I got people to kik back ! -.-
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Have dropped my phone a few times since I've gotten this case and it hasn't fallen off, shattered, or cracked my screen at all. Very pleased. Very cost efficient. Arrived fast. Bought one for my roommate also who breaks her phone often! She needed a good case.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very insightful and helpful.  The writer is very knowledgeable of the historical conditions of the first and second centuries of the Christian era.[
1781162646|5.0|I thought the character and first person narration was authentic, and the plot terrific. Good suspense, and just enough clues to keep me reading on. The setting was fun. It was another excellent King novel. Perfect cover art, as well.
B00AEFXL5W|5.0|I recently saw this movie for a 50th anniversary of the movie's release. I was too young at the time when it was released and loved the fact that I could watch it on the big screen. This is a must have for your video library. The memories it brings back of growing up in the sixties, the beautiful clothes Audrey wears in the film, such nostalgia.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I won't go into details on each song since there are other reviewers that have done a much better job than I could, but I will say that this is a phenomenal album. It's dark, unforgiving, and perfectly reflects the emotion that Josh and the rest of the band was feeling in the fog; any fan who can appreciate Josh's strive to keep each album different will love this album and will not be disappointed.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|I have not watched the the movie as it is for my granddaughter for Christmas as she really wanted it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Poignant examples of what kids go through in the system and the difference between good and bad placements.  We all suffer when kids are mistreated.
B00DHHWYAW|4.0|Very good movie holds your interest as it is a long movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as the great Gatsby.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I have been using kik on my kindle ever since i got it and it worked perfectly now all of a sudden it stopped working it wont let me log in because apparently there is an &quot;error&quot; and i cant make a new account.
B000C13Y2S|1.0|It was NOT what you advertised in the PHOTO!!  I expected to receive round, chrome legs with rubber feet - as pictured.  Instead you sent the cheap model with flat, plastic (grey) legs.
0757302661|5.0|A treasure of invaluable insights and practices for a sacred journey. Highly recommend from the day a woman knows she  wants to birth.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|The fact that this little girl of 16 possesses the feministic prowess and such poetic genius is a large enough conundrum for most music lovers. And that's before you even hear her musical sound: a beautiful storm of start vibes and electro-synth pop, as if Adele's essence married Lana del Rey's audacity, maintaining both of their individual prose. Tennis Court, Royals, Ribs, and Team stand out for their minimalist sound and sharp lyrics, causing what can only be called a cinematic or ethereal feeling for the listener. I highly recommend it!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|what a great way to watch the series at your own pace.This is the first time doing this. Many friends have asked to borrow the series that they also missed.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This is a fun book, some new characters, but some old and familiar ones.  A new and different setting than the usual.
1401216676|5.0|One of the best comic books in one of the best editions. Got a lot of enjoy while reading it and holding this in my hands
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it. A good way to see the origins of S.H.I.E.L.D, Nick Fury, and the upcoming Avengers movie franchise.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Great game! My Mom even likes to play this game! It's addicting, and the music video is the cutest. I love how you can unlock the characters at the main menu. Overall, great game. I'd definitely recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I consider this pure trash!!  The plot is absured, the contents bordered on bneing pronographic, and it was  just awful. I rreally had to struggle to make myself finish the book.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Wonderful story about the growing relationship between an able bodied person and an individual who is wheelchair bound. I laughed and cried at the depth of their relationship and the hard decisions that were made that changed each persons life.  I highly recommend this book...heart lifting.
1468179993|3.0|One time reading only. Good set of advices not only for those who wish to make it on TED, but for every presenter.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Lives up to my high expectations!!! Just saw him in Austin for the Unstoppable Momentum tour and like always, Joe delivers!!
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|Kind of predictable plot. Total fluff movie with a few fun moments. Worth a viewing if you want a fun movie that you don't have to think about.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I loved this season's episodes.  They kept me very entertained.  You won't regret watching it unless you get scared easily.
0316286850|3.0|Kind of out of out of date now, but still great tips for various makeup looks. It still was an interesting read.
0553801473|5.0|can't wait for the sequel .......
B007C94XG4|5.0|best movie ever. my fav out of three movie would be this one and its greay for all ages love it
B000BYRCH4|5.0|i love paul walker and hes a awesome person and good actor  and want to find more about him if i can find more movies about him i want have more movies of him
B00CL151G4|5.0|Excellent I really enjoyed watching the series the DVD was of good quality and met my expectations thank you cool
B00000K3UU|5.0|he is a good daddy and he desered to have that little guy and dont let any social security take that guy away from big daddy
B00DJ6KYWQ|4.0|The novel gathers pace as it proceeds. Well written with good explanations of characters and technical terms.<br />I was, however, waiting for a &#34;twist&#34; at the end but it never arrived.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|i love the way she always good listen and learn about the story about whistal stop<br />and now i want to know who really killed frank bennett? do i have to say im glad frank bennett is dead because i dont like frank bennett and i would kill him anyways<br />love this movie
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I bought this device thinking it is going to be able to stream Netflix BY ITSELF. This was going to be a gamechanger and put Roku out of business. But no, all this device does is to allow you to use ANOTHER DEVICE to beam the Netflix audio/video to the Chromecast device that is connected to your TV via the HDMI port. Yes, it is semi-useful as a way to stream Netflix using your laptop or your phone (iPhone, Android) but that means you need something else to be able to stream Netflix (a laptop, iPhone, or Android device). So this Chromecast does NOT replace your Roku box because your Roku box can stream Netflix all by itself without requiring any other device.<br /><br />Furthermore, I was hoping Chromecast would allow me to stream my music from my Samsung Galaxy S4 to the TV. Seems lie it should be able to stream anything from my phone to the TV, right? NOPE, it doesn't do that either. It only works with Google Music AND you must store all your music in the Google cloud for you to stream it.  Apparently Chromecast cannot just stream the media files stored on your phone to your TV. BUMMER!<br /><br />I am sorely disappointed in this device. I was going to buy one for every single TV in the house, thinking I can make them all Netflix-capable. NOT!<br /><br />If you have any Netflix device already such as Roku box, an Internet-enabled TV, a Blue-ray player with Internet capability, or any other Netflix device, then you would not need to use this. I can't see myself using my Samsung S4 to stream Netflix from my phone to the TV. That would mean that my phone has to be doing the streaming itself the entire length of the movie, sucking up valuable battery from the phone. I guess if you have no Netflix device at home and you do not have a laptop with the Intel Wireless Display capability, then this Chromecast would be useful for you. But watch out for that battery drain if you use your phone to stream Netflix to the TV.<br /><br />Even if you use your laptop, you cannot stream music from your laptop to the Chromecast. The only thing you can stream to Chromecast is something that can be displayed in Google Chrome. HA! So much for my wanting to stream my audio/video files on the laptop to the Chromecast.<br /><br />By comparison, if you have the Intel Wireless Display capability on your laptop (it's easy to get it even if your laptop currently doesn't have it--just buy a new replacement half-height Wifi card for your laptop like the Intel Network 6235AN.HMWWB Centrino WiFi Card Advanced-N 6235 Dual Band Bluetooth Retail), you can buy something like the Netgear PUSH2TV HD PTV2000 1080P Adapter for Wireless Display and it would allow you to stream ANYTHING from your laptop wirelessly to your TV. If I have to use my laptop to stream Netflix, then I'd rather spend another $10 box to get the Netgear device so I can stream ALL my media to my TV. This Chromecast cannot compete with the Netgear in that department.<br /><br />Google, if you are reading this, take notes. Put some software and a user-interface on the Chromecast so that it CAN go online by itself and stream Netflix, Hulu, etc., BY ITSELF. It doesn't take much to have a basic user-interface.  The device is already on Wifi so there's no reason it can't go surf the Web on its own. And please allow us to be able to stream whatever audio/video streams from our device to the Chromecast. Do that and you will have a real useful product.<br /><br />Until Chromecast can fetch its own Netflix, this device has very limited usefulness for me.
B0057GUE3K|5.0|This is an intense movie.  I like the fact that keeps you in suspense.  As usual Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a great performance.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I am very happy with this app. The light is bright and wonderful for use in dark, small places. I definitely recommend it.
B002DQDV6Y|4.0|Fun movie for the whole family to watch.  Read the book first!  Stays true to the book which was great as the kids could identify the parts.
0142501123|5.0|I received a review copy of the book, and I think it the sweetest thing ever, perfect for introducing toddlers to the usual cast of characters during Halloween: witches, frogs, cauldrons, cats, etc...  Everything is drawn in a whimsical, cheerful style, and all the characters are smiling. The rhyming makes is a great book to read out loud.  Highly recommended.
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|There are a few songs on this CD that I had never heard and am enjoying listening to. However, some of the other songs are not that good.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Puzzle game using logic to plot out spots on a graph to reveal hidden image. Some are easy, others not so much. Easy to pick up
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|This is my favorite of the Bob Bootleg series so far. His Self-Portrait album has been unfairly maligned, misrepresented, and misunderstood for some time now, and I think New Morning is a song-writing masterpiece. I am very, very happy with this release.
0007466064|5.0|My whole family loved the first four books so we had to continue reading.  This book was wonderful and now ordering the next one.  The books are so much better than the HBO series because they give you more details and lets your imagination soar.  Highly recommended.
B001DCZ4IW|4.0|Maud really knew how to live Love and 'let go'.<br />She gave quite an experience and set quite an example for Harold.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I love this show, the cast of characters are perfect. This is a very good show. I look forward to it weekly
B00B3L3RPA|4.0|What fascinated me, when I finally read the novel, was the creature's basic desire to be loved. Love is what he most envied among the humans he observed.  The realization that he was not loved, even by his creator, aroused horror in the creature, then led to the creature's inflicting horror on others.  There is a lesson here for humanity.
B003YTPS7O|5.0|This flick grabs your heart strings from the get-go with touching performances by both Albert Finney & Freddie Highmore.  The obvious mutual affection and admiration sets the stage for a series of &#34;flashbacks&#34; throughout the movie which further endear these characters.  Crowe's usual flippance is turned on its head as the tale is spun until you are rooting him on from your seat.  Marion Cottilard is fiesty and smart, eventually softening to assume the role of heroine.  The neighbors will delight you and a long lost relative makes an appearance to change the way everyone thinks about family. There are no sex scenes, but this is truly a love story.  Watch it.
B0035HKWM6|4.0|Jim does a really good job of portraying the bumbler person and yet he works his magic while under the influence of the Mask..
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It was great to catch up with Dan/Danny/Doc after so many years!  The story was interesting, well-paced, and easy to follow.  Although I don't consider this a \\"horror\\" story in any way, I do consider it \\"supernatural.\\"  The characters were well developed.  In a couple parts of the story, the turning point and one of the final scenes, felt a bit contrived to me.  Overall, however, I enjoyed this story.  Dan's story, abilities, and his plight make for a page turning read.
0790729407|5.0|One of my favorite historical films of all time.  Great story of the Father of modern Guerilla warfare and his role in Ireland's Independence.
0375805613|5.0|The first time I read this to my son I felt like I was 3 again.  The other reviewers saying the book makes no sense can go suck on an egg.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I bought this recently and it was more than what I expected. Love the easy set up the way it looks. The power button being camouflaged using the 3 in the title is brilliant. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase.
B00CATONCA|5.0|This was bought as a Christmas gift for our son in law. He is going to love it...we got him the second series with the zombie head way cool. If you are a walking dead fan then these are for you...the special editions are worth the money you pay for them. Put together nice not a cheapply packaged thing.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|An interesting story that is supported by strong acting and directing. We were really pleased with this production, and give it a 3.5 out of 5 star rating.
B005VU9LVI|5.0|Better version with bells and whistles on this blu ray. Where the other blu ray lacks this one provides everything.
B008Q07GLW|5.0|One of the all-time greats!!! And what a great cast. Newman and Redford together are terrific. Great music. I'm in love with Katherine Ross, too...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Absolutely great. Using it daily.<br /><br />Wireless HDMI<br />-------------------<br /> - Chromecast is like a Wireless HDMI for 35 bucks.<br /> - I use my Boxee mostly for watching youtube and netflix videos, and now Chromecast has replaced it.<br /><br />Tab/Screen Casting<br />-------------------------<br />- Tab casting works great for viewing most of the web pages with mostly static content. You'll experience lag while watching videos, audio might be out of sync.<br />- Screen casting isn't great with my experience. It stops every now and then, stating network issue.<br /><br />Power Up<br />-------------<br />I have a Samsung LCD TV with Anynet+, so as soon as you enable Chrome cast streaming on your phone or PC, TV turns ON and it automatically switches to HDMI input on which Chromecast is connected. That is a great feature.<br /><br />Switching Control With Different Devices<br />---------------------------------------------------<br />Of course, you can play a video from your laptop, pause it from phone and resume it again from a tablet. Every device will detect chromecast and shows you what is being played so that you can control it from that device.<br /><br />Pretty Stable<br />----------------<br />Since its the first gen I was expecting occasional crashes, frozen screens, and other issues that might need us to reboot Chromecast. So far no issues whatsoever.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Great CD.  Love Imagine Dragons and all their music. Good price and happy with my purchase. Thank you for this item.
B004PJG7MW|5.0|This is a great little movie about a robot coming to life with his personality.<br />Favorite line: Your mother is a snowblower!
0316247545|5.0|Background info, many quotes and tidbits from the creators, and good character bio and episode summaries for fanfic writers, and plenty of other great material.<br /><br />Also, all the song lyrics up to Season 3!  Now I can REALLY drive my coworkers insane!  (I'm a villain IRL.)  &#62;:}
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just the best in science fiction television series. Can't just leave it hanging needs/demands  more!  I am a brown coat forever.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|This was a fantastic movie! Why four stars? It was different, it had its moments, it diverted from the comics has made the mandarin to be and what his capabilities are. I would think with all the special effects Hollywood uses and all the tech we have, they could have made the movie more realistic. Other than my opinion, it was great. Sad to see this being the end of the series of movies.
B000A6T1JU|3.0|I remember this film as a gritty look at NY gang life with a lot of violence and a hero protagonist that wasn't Hollywood formula. This had too much gimmick. Sometimes the director needs to let a film stand or fall on it's own merits, And stand it did.
B00C7AXJMW|4.0|I preferred the first two books of the trilogy.  But I was thrilled to read this one, if it meant I could find out what happens to the characters.
0375842209|5.0|Loved the book from beginning to end.  I only wish there was a sequel or other stories that ran along side it for more reading pleasure. I almost wonder if the story was actually from a true event in the authors family's past.
B001EBWING|5.0|Casablanca is definitely a product of its time, but also a classic of the genre.  I have lost count of the number of times I have seen it, but would gladly watch it again anytime it's available.
0375830995|1.0|Did not really enjoy this book as it seemed rather a dark story.  While the story idea was interesting, which is what intrigued me to purchase it, the actual story line didn't really go anywhere. Kinda left me wondering why I was reading it.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|It's just a series of bad jokes about poo and wrinkles. According to the movie, men poo and get hemorrhoids. Women get wrinkles and plastic surgery.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I find the.\\"Harry Hole\\" series to be great and FUN reading. I look forward to my next adventure in the Harry Hole series. Thank you, Jo Nesbo!
0385347774|5.0|I started this book because a friend suggested that I read it.  It was ok in the start and then I  got to a point where I could not put it down.  What an good read with an interested ending.  I am sure any reader will enjoy it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|If all you want to do is build stuff and are fond of the old SIM city game, this game is for you.
1585429155|5.0|This is the most brilliant book I've read regarding the workings of the conscious and subconscious minds and how<br />You get what you are after. It starts by changing your thinking, that shouldn't be to hard.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As always Stephen King takes something normal from our world and makes it terrifying.  This is what I love the most.  It was great to see how Dan turned out and what became of his \\"shine\\"'
0375869026|5.0|I am reading this book with my 9 year old son, and though he has lots of questions, I think that the message is definitely hitting home.  Well written!
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Something enjoyable is to have the opportunity to play both path... And my Dark side is strong in me... lol...
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Great show, comedy, science and romance all rolled into one! I loved getting to know all the characters!! I kept rooting for Jo!!
B008NMT684|5.0|My little kids just love this game.<br /> Great for ages 2 and 3, if you have little ones this is a must.
B00F35BV64|4.0|A good action packed movie, but was easily predictable. Still can follow if you've never seen the show. Overall though we would watch again.
B00DGGIXS6|4.0|Welcome back Cher!  She flourishes on the slower upper tempo ballads on the second half of the album.  The dance tracks do not seem overly cutting edge, as they have an 80's feel to the tracks.  Some very good songs on the album; however I think the songs will have a tough time getting radio play.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I am not a Woody Allen fan by any means...in fact since married his daughters have boycotted his movies. But this one made me lift the embargo. I bought it as a gift for my husband for Christmas.<br /><br />We both love Paris, and Paris is a major character in this film. The first 6-8 minutes sums up our love affair with Paris. It's a fun, offbeat romantic comedy with a sweet ending.<br /><br />I normally an only watch a movie twice as there's too much out there I want to experience and most movies aren't worth the time.  I've probably seen this movie 6 times and my husband over 15.<br /><br />It's a good movie
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Sometimes you have to try more than once to get things to interact but otherwise a fun game with good graphics.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|My husband loved it in the theater and I wanted him to be able to enjoy this at home.  I strongly suspect he will put this in his camper.
B00133KFGW|4.0|I loved this movie. Anyone who really enjoys music will love watching this young boy discover his talent and find his parents
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|If you have the choice between this and Airport City, take this one.  My main criticism is that it's difficult to figure out what all the icons mean.
B0014JKJJI|3.0|in one week the part wich have contact with the groud, fell down. I had to put it back with somekind of glue.<br />The rest of the shoe was perfect. I'm using it at work, regardless the problem that I had.
B004IPPINW|5.0|This book is as good as its reviews! Wonderfully written. STRONGLY recommend reading it!<br />A very powerful and captivating story.
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|I did not understand this cd.  seems to be a lot of noise with  lot of yelling and ranting and odd noises
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It ducks you in to the point where it is addicting.  I love love love this game and can't put it down. Its easy ti understand but doesn't leave you bored.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great pix. Fun trying to anticipate what completes the picture. Colors crisp and clear. Amazing how addictive this game can be.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|I am absolutely amazed at the ability George Harrison had to compose music. Beautiful harmonies and the guitar playing is superb.
B008IGP8QE|3.0|My girls recognized some of the songs as being from the show, but not all -- and they watch this show so often they have lines memorized. It's got a few hits and a few misses.
1596434252|5.0|Love it!<br /><br />I bought it for my son, to learn about letters. I wound up enjoying it as well. Inventive, witty and well presented.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I bought this because the idea of the dongle that I can transport everywhere and have Netflix at my fingertips seems like an even better way to get the most out of my account. I got it, tried it and LOVED it, but since then it has been collecting dust on my shelf. Because I have a DVD player with wireless capabilities I don't see the need in using it at home. However I am very excited to try it out on the road, in hotels or friend's houses who don't have Netflix access. I think this is a great little thing for people on the go who want to have their apps for streaming at the tips of their fingers. I'm happy I bought it, even if I'm not getting a ton of use from it yet, it works well and seamlessly with my Galaxy S4.
B00CL151G4|5.0|I love this show! Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Lui do a great job. I was skeptical at first of both placing the series in New York (America in general) and of a female Watson but both have been handled exceptionally well. It would have been nice if there had been a Blu-ray option but that is my only complaint.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Great \\"debut\\" album for Ryan Adams with his band the cardinals. It begins a remarkable string of albums up until thier end around 2009. A double cd that may have benefited from editing down to a single disc, but Ryan Adams has such diversity to his songs that he needed 2 discs to put out everything he wanted. While the cardinals studio albums are as good as any group during the second half of the naughts, the real strength of this band were its live shows. Many live recordings in soundboard quality are accessible on the net. After getting his studio output, grab a live show and hear them come alive
B00FF56IR4|3.0|If you're already a fan, you'll already decide you like it before you watch.<br /><br />If you're a discerning viewer, you'll recognize that the writing is nowhere near the same ballpark as Avengers, and that this show is mostly for kids.<br /><br />Some moments are truly garbage.<br /><br />Others are iffy at best...<br /><br />And a few moments are indeed very good.<br /><br />Has potential, depending on how it develops - but in the era of Breaking Bad etc., this show is prob. not worth your time.
0345803485|5.0|The book came exactly how it was described.  In great condition for a second hand book. So glad I bought it!! :)
B0046B1KHG|5.0|To me the movie is a bit irritating, but the kiddos loved it and we will be watching over and over especially as the weather gets cooler
B003TVMIDO|5.0|it is fantastic couldn't ask for anything more just love it & made me so happy thanks so much thanks again
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|First of all, I have a Wii that's set up with Amazon Instant video and Netflix, so the only reason that I got this was to be able to actually use Amazon Instant video without the help of my computer (not sure if anyone else has had this problem, but I can stream beautifully from my computer, but the Wii app just sucks and I can't get through anything without it having to buffer 4-5 times, but it doesn't do it when the computer it hooked up). I was a little dissapointed that I had to download another browser (I don't use chrome, and really didn't want to have to use it), but I did, and it does work to broadcast anything on the Chrome browser to the computer. It worked pretty well on the computer (better than with the Chromecast app on my iPhone, which I didn't get to work at all), but if you are able to hook up your computer to your TV (or you use your Wii), you really don't need this. At least not until Google is able to offer more apps than they have now.
B004KBSQOW|4.0|As the title implies this was why I purchased this cd. It's good but wish I had ordered the one where it goes right into<br />&#34;What a wonderful world&#34;. Next time I will!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Love it!  Got all refreshed ready for season four to start on October 13.  Great that price was dropped too!
0812993292|5.0|Several characters in this book experience a pilgrimage – not just Harold Fry. This is a sweet book of redemption.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Itwas a great movie.very little blood and no gore.I would definitely recommend to my friends.  I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I think it's a great book for teens, shows them how everything they do or say, no matter how small it may seem,  can effect others.
B005NJFSZK|5.0|My husband bought this for our grandson who was visiting last summer. Our grandson was so excited because this car was so hard to find. The car was waiting for him when they got home within days of the order.
1449410243|5.0|This book is fun from start start to finish! My friends and I compared notes and agreed that only a true cat loved could read this without becoming a bit nervous when their kitty gives them the &#34;stink eye&#34;. I must say that I've earned new respect for my cat when mulling over the signs that she just MIGHT have ulterior motives when she exhibits some of the behavior described!
B007A4SDCG|4.0|What i liked about the book was its simplicity and straightforward approach. Not much new learning for me, though I doubt it was the intent.<br /><br />Great motivation if you need some nudging to get to doing what you must.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a really fun app.  It works smoothly on Kindle Fire. Graphics are neat. Not too easy and not too hard.  One gets better with practice at solving the puzzles. I would recommend.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|So far the game has been fun and addictive. I've been playing the game for about 4 hrs. now. Only thing I think could be better is to lower the cost of revives and or raise the amount receive for each mission.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|I loved it! It's better than series! I hope they make another movie. Thought, it's kind of cheesy. But liked the movie!
B008Y212PI|5.0|FlipPix Art - Simple is very satisfying and fun to play. The game is set-up as a grid, and sometimes a series of grids, which have a picture hidden in them.<br /><br />Simply figure out if the blocks within the grid need to be filled in or deleted by referring to the numbers located in the headers of each row and/or column.<br /><br />Very easy to understand. Very easy to begin playing. Very difficult to put down! I love this game!!!!
B0013ND36G|4.0|It was okay. At first, I though it was better than terminator 2 but now I'm not sure. Still, it was fine. I hadn't watched terminator 4 yet but.... I hoped Terminator 5 was better than all of above the movies of terminator and remember, Arnold Schwarzenegger said he'll be back.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Awesome movie!  Scenes catch you off guard making it very suspenseful and the graffics terrific.  Although a great adult movie, this is not a kid movie as some things would scare a child.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is a really fun movie and the music is great.  Anyone who appreciates wonderful harmony will like this movie!
014312093X|3.0|He is a hard read.  The story is good, but his sentences drag on and on.  He had to choose between telling a story and showing us his language skills, and tried to do both.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|does not get what I thought it would. I've already removed it from my Kindle because it does not get any of the channels I'm interested in
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I am absolutely addicted to the game, would like more levels tho possibly a dirt bike track type, maybe an actual monster truck.
8186336141|5.0|Great book and really good quality i like it very much very informative. i am doing my yoga teacher training and this book has helped me alot.
0812993292|5.0|We read this book for our neighborhood book club.  We all thoroughly enjoyed it.  I ordered it from Amazon and it came promptly and was very reasonable.
B001FB4VY4|5.0|It's hard to rate a DVD but it was shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition.  We love the Big Bang Theory so it was a given we'd like the item.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Given the price of this little guy, it really has a lot of power. Straight out of the box I could tell this was the real deal (I know a lot of these are being reproduced and sold as knock-offs). But the one I received is great. Make sure you turn up the volume on this amp and down on your device, or you'll give your ears quite a shock and possibly a good bit of damage. I was so mad at first because when I first hooked everything up, I turned it on and it was so quiet. But then I discovered the volume controls on the side and set it at a comfortable level. All-in-all, if you're looking for something that's fairly cheap and will give you more for money and your fancy new headphones, look no further. Good buy for novice music-lovers.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|I can't believe you got 4 stars from other people.  It doesn't say much for the intelligence of the audients watching this film.  Bad Bad Bad, Not worth my money.  My husband felt the same way.  We watch hopping the plot got better but it never did.
0451197879|3.0|I assumed this would be a horror story because of the author. I was wrong, but it was still interesting.
B00275EHJG|5.0|i love this movie and so does my wife and son which why i bought it in the first place.
B003NTSBTC|5.0|Buy this book and read it. You will understand and appreciate the movie better. There appears to be a couple different versions of the movie. Reading the book makes I clearer

B003L77GH4|4.0|i bought this for my wife and while i am not a huge fan the show does have its good parts
B0045LSIRM|5.0|Saw the concert live and this CD captured it all.  I just love that is just Bryan Adams signing and the cheers of the audience. Raw and with so emotion.  A must have for any fan!
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|i love this movie and so does my wife and son which why i bought it in the first place.
B00DJYJRHG|3.0|First of all, this reissue is not in a collectible book. I assume that summary was merely cut and pasted from the original complete series set.<br /><br />The episodes are in widescreen - don't remember if this is mentioned in the specs. I haven't gone through all of the discs, but it appears as though most of the extras from the original sets (deleted scenes, commentaries) have been ported over.<br /><br />The problem with the packaging is that the discs are housed on 2 spindles built into the packaging. There may be grooves there intended to keep the discs from touching, but you know how that goes. The outer packaging is book-style, similar to Fox's DVD version of the Alien Quadrilogy. This one isn't as bad as that one, in terms of the number of folds, but it is still too thick for the flimsy packaging. In all, the show is still one of the best shows ever but if, like me, you didn't buy the original series set after reading about the problematic packaging, don't bother with this one either.
B00BLRXDTQ|3.0|The theme has been done better- so many times since these are getting hard to watch (to me)  I got through the first one-couldn't finish the 2nd, seemed idiotic as did the first.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|One of their best albums yet, a band that truly shows maturity as time passes. Must buy this even if not a fan!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it!! I haven't read such a good book in the longest time and this is really a good book to be honest I was so happy with it
0374530718|5.0|If you are about to take philosophy read this first! It will save your butt and put things in understandable terms. Very helpful!!
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Lives go to quickly and if you aren't connected to facebook then you either have to wait or buy more lives. Ain't nobody got time for that!
B008R96NIY|4.0|Perhaps a little too detailed at times, but then the intricate, and at times confused, machinations of politics leading up to the war needs to be understood, as this is the essence of the book
B008Y212PI|5.0|Not my first FlipPix app.  Same, reliable game play, with more puzzles than most of the previous.  To be honest, I am posting this review to unlock the last few pictures - but I don't mind because Ai really like this series.  Also like the hex games by the same Developer.  For both, game play is simple and straight forward with a good tutorial to show the basic gameplay.  Love these, try one and I bet you will too.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|All levels are fun. With so many different levels to play, playing them over is never boring. Challenging and stimulating.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. Good for all ages.  I could spend hours playing this game. This game models the movie well
B000KZFMZI|5.0|This was the complete second season and it was exactly as it was described. Good product- worth buying. Thank you
B00594XOZU|1.0|App use to work perfect now it won't let me log in. Been having issue for a week now. Fix it please I miss this app
B000002L3P|5.0|Great Album, I had purchased singles of Kenny's that others had told me about and bought this one to round out my collection. I went to his concert this summer and he had played a few cuts from this album so I ordered it and have to say it is my favorite.<br />This band is simply amazing!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just love the series, need more like this in the USA on regular TV not cable.  Love Maggie Smith! She is the best!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book changed my whole outlook on life. The minute I opened myself to want was important to me and not feeling awkward for wanting it, I could finally see the pictures of the life I have wanted to become and it was good. Things quickly became to change in the most unusual ways, which quickly made me understand I way on the correct path. I changed the channel in thoughts, as the author suggested in my life which does indeed change the frequency by changing your thoughts.<br />This book suggest that the Universe has been answering you all your life, but you cannot receive the answers unless you are aware Be aware of everything around you, because you are receiving the answers to you questions in ever moment of ever moment of every day. This can manifest through music, a gentle word, a strange smell. Be careful watch you declare...Every single &#34;I'm not.,is a creation! Be aware of what you say. Say I Am, There is an unlimited supply of ideas waiting for you to tap into am tap into bringing forth, You hold everything in your consciousness...copied from book
B00D6QUJ6U|1.0|This BluRay disc has terrible video quality. It does not look as good as the DVD. The sound is great but the picture is terrible.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This is a great read.  It's informative and written well.  Very entertaining.  Very descriptive and gets you right in the action.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|First 25 minutes is like an LSD Trip. Then it slows down to a story that you can at least follow. The Modern Music in a movie that is set in the 20's just ads to the confusion. However, as a date movie you won't be distracted the wanting to watch the film and can have some fun.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|The product was very delightful and met my expectations. The product was in good health and worked on demand. Was very pleased and the customer service met my expectations as well.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|Entertaining new twist on Dredd's character.  I liked it.  Pretty decent action and the rookie's psychic powers add a little something extra.  Worth watching if you have Prime.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Awesome movie! I rented on amazon but thinking of buying it for myself. It is a must see! Great storyline too
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've honestly never heard of Anker until a friend recommended this mice to me. Apparently most of the things they make aren't that good, except this mice. There's a lot of positive reviews online for this one so I tried it out and I have to agree that it's really good for a $40 mice. 8000DPI with customizable weights, and designed to be big enough for people with big hands like me. So I definitely recommend this one.
B00594XOZU|1.0|My kik was working fine, but then it stopped working. Please fix this app, I loved it like crazy, but now ....I hate it..):(
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|*Mild spoilers*<br /><br />I've always been a luke-warm fan of Stephen King, because his novels tend to be hit or miss for me.  I was intrigued that he penned this one as a sequel to the Shining, so I picked it up.  One rainy weekend later, I was done with the book, which I enjoyed quite a bit.  Perfect?  Of course not, but it was entertaining.<br />The first part of the book is mostly dedicated to telling us what happened to Danny Torrance after the events of the Shining and into his adult hood, where he becomes Dan, the promiscuous alcoholic drifter who struggles to live with his Shining (psychic) abilities.  Eventually after an eye-opening \\"morning-after\\" encounter with a young single mom, her child, and some nose candy, Dan settles down in a sleepy North Eastern town and tries his luck at AA.  Meanwhile, elsewhere in New Hampshire, a young girl named Abra Stone is coming into her own Shining abilities.  Unfortunately, she's being hunted by a group of RV driving quasi-immortals that call themselves The True Knot.  They survive by consuming the \\"steam\\" of psychic children, while torturing them to death.  Abra cries out for help (psychically, of course) and guess who hears her?  Dan to the rescue...<br />All in all, I thought it was an entertaining read, with some creepy moments, and lots of tension.  Some people will probably be annoyed by all of the pop culture references but these were almost a comfort for me, in an odd way, during some of the more tense/creepy moments in the story.  I also think they are a reflection of the America we live in today, in which we are bombarded by advertising and driven by consumerism.<br />I will agree with the reviewers that felt that The True Knot were not as scary as other King villains.  They are still human and able to be killed, and they have their own particular weaknesses as members of The True.  They also care about each other, which might turn off readers that are into more \\"pure evil\\" types of villains.  Personally though, I think the mistake that King made was establishing that Abra was incredibly powerful, right from the beginning.  The anticipation leading up to her encounters with Rose the Hat and all of the others, was nerve-wracking at times, but the actual encounters themselves were not.  Rose gets her ass handed to her in the middle of the book.  This kind of made me doubt her as the prime antagonist.  And unfortunately, the ending is sort of anti-climactic, which is a problem I've had with other books King has written.  There is so much build-up to the end, but then everything just kind of falls flat and it's over in a few pages.  That said, there is still much to enjoy here.  I read the book in two days, and was glued to the page, so he's still doing something right.
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|some words have meanings but it lack of deeper word that i really need. maybe you should add a lot of compound words.
B009AMANBA|5.0|such a great film that i make my students watch it and i don't care if it seems adult but it is good for them
B007FIY3VW|5.0|i choose this app because i really need this and this is very helpfull. i need to be productive helping in my projects.
B00000JLWW|5.0|for my dad's caregiver and she liked it i think or did i return it and i don't remember hah
B0097HSS4M|1.0|I personally did not care for this product and would not recommend it to anyone.  It's looks are decieving.  It's a good thing it was free, I would have been upset had I paid for it.  I deleted it almost immediately.
0385040253|4.0|Good book. Lots and lots and lots of history. Diagrams are confusing but you can make them out after some study.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|I had wondered what all the hype was about this movie.  I don't have kids but I wanted to watch it myself.  It was a cute story.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was nervous about this book. How could stephen king top himself? He manages to find Danny in a new tale that grabs you by the short and curlies and never lets go.
B0063GORYU|5.0|works great on my kindle :)  ... easy and fun! much better than the program on my laptop. and free ...
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Definitely cruised through some of the slower spots, and there were more than a couple of characters I'd just as soon not have been introduced to... however there are still many good stories lines.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is riveting!  It wraps a bit of mystery, good trumps evil and romance all in one incredible series.  I can't wait for Season 4!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|When I tried to connect the Google Chromecast to my LCD TV through the HDMI interface the Chromecast couldn't connect to my network!!!  Therefore it didn't work.  I contacted Google through their customer helpline but they couldn't help me either.  I am still waiting for a proper firmware update so that the Chromecast would work with my Sharp LCD TV and my Netgear interfaced wireless home network...!!!
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|An awesome movie. One of the funniest scifi movies I've ever seen. The cast works really well together to make this far fetched story seem to work really well.
0756665949|5.0|i couldn't believe how much information was packed into this encyclopedia.  i'm a big fan of the show.  i thought i knew lost, but this text put me to shame.  i loved it.
B000005S0D|5.0|Awsome, incredible sound, a long long songs with an instrumentation out of mind. I love the atmosfhere of the Stationary Traveller theme.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good game, easy to use. only wish getting gems didn't take so long....some things cost a lot, and earning one takes forever.
1781162646|5.0|I haven't read a Stephen King book in years. Although many years ago I read The Stand 3 times!!  This book was recommended to me by a friend. I really loved it. Super fast reading, and the story was typical Stephen King (a good thing)
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is an amazing series. The actors are fantastic and the writers of the script are to be commended. I recommend this to anyone. Already bought Season 2 and put my order in for Season 3
B00C2VIA52|5.0|The title says it all. I enjoy trading card duel style games even though I am usually pretty bad at them however, I am finding this game enjoyable and I am actually not too bad at this moment but I have seen the difficulty increase as a move i  campaign and the pillage feature. Con not sure how alchemy works in this game as there is no explanation on what to do. Lots of fun and I recommend .. Been playing obsessively.
B005FUTBWS|5.0|I Loved this Movie, For it's Brave Exposure of a Problem that is in Much Need of Solutions &#34;Religious Brainwashing&#34;
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked the story line and was sucked in at the very beginning...first wondering what the darn letter said and then how everything would unfold. A nice balance of life, love and how it all can get thrown out of balance.
0785163174|4.0|It was a pretty cool story. I really enjoyed it. I would suggest it to other fans if marvel comics.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I thought this book was written well and particularly enjoyed the input of sub-conscience thoughts. It definitely should appeal to those who have no knowledge of bdsm for it appears to be a introductory to that way of life; a minimal introductory. I did also think it reflected very well to the age of Anastasia with it being written in her perspective. However, having said that I would've of enjoyed it more if it was written on a bit more of a maturer level rather than a woman so young.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|It's very fun adorable characters too I love it so do my sisters and brothers if u want to have fun download it.
0345455681|5.0|This is one of the best of Rutherford's works! I enjoy all his books, but this one I come back to time and again. The intricate weaving of family relationships through time and people in history is a masterpiece of literature. A must read for any history buff
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This is a really awesome season in that a lot happens in it!!! It left us hanging at te end as a cliff hanger but still a great season!!
B00018D44U|5.0|I like anything N. Jones does, and this CD did not fail to impress.  Her voice, like fine wine, only gets better with time.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Love it. Can't wait to see more. Keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. I look forward to watching the other seasons.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is the first album I've owned of Adele's, and I love the whole thing.  Her voice is as smooth as silk, and I'm definitely going to buy more of her albums.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Puzzles are fun and challenging. The only issue is the energy doesn't reload fast enough, and the crystals are too difficult to acquire.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I wanted to try this game to see if my girls would be able to. Well I don't want to let them play, I love this game to much.
B00867HDTA|3.0|Once you have fun getting the \\"feel\\" of the game (which took me about five minutes), then the game becomes brutally easy and redundant. And repetitive. This game, like others in the series, is cute and all, but again, once you get the hang of it, ALL challenge is then reduced to zero. Would be 4 stars if free (-1 for lack of depth), however I am giving it 3 stars because they normally charge money for this. Without content this isn't worth money, sorry. But it is a good start towards a real game-- just add more depth, please!
B006MW3UZW|3.0|Season two turned it up a bit.  I'm enjoying it and I like the unpredictability of it.  Still not quite as good as I thought it would be after all the hype.
B006L3RZ26|5.0|Thought this might be a good c/d.<br />It turned out to be one my instant favorite c/ds.<br />The greatest from Ms Yang.
0738737909|5.0|Cards are artistically gorgeous. The gold edging is sooooo classy. Makes a great gift. One disappointment is that at the end of the book it recommends &#34; The Tarot Illuminati Revealed&#34; and Amazon has it for Kindle only. Where can I buy this book???
B002O3Z4QQ|5.0|I was in Copenhagen, Denmark when the first walk happened and the locals came and banged on our door to come and see what was going on.  They couldn't believe the U.S. would broadcast something that dangerous live because the chances for a mishap were so great.  The Russians always waited until whatever they were doing was over a success before they broadcast it.  The space program was the best advertising for our free and open way of life to all the rest of the world.  This DVD set is a great remembrance of our best efforts.
B0001907DA|5.0|Light humorous fun.  Borderline ridiculous, but always fun to watch.  Each character is a distinct individual, which contributes to the overall success of the films.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I could not read this book fast enough and yet am sorry I've finished reading it! Simply a wonderful and thoroughly satisfying tale. LOVED IT!
B00AHGSVKS|1.0|I bought this book based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews. Book is trash. Extremely simplistic, assertions about human psychology are grossly incorrect in my opinion. The story itself is just boring. I am shocked that so many people like this.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|The wife usually doesn't like shoot'em up movies, but she laughed thru most of this one. Willis is Willis and playing Willis works for him. If you like Willis you'll like this
B00594XOZU|1.0|I typed my username and my password and clicked next and it started loading but then said that it was taking to long and to try again later so I did an even the next day I tried and it still didn't work so I deleted the app.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Just goes to show how screwed up things were back in the day's of Jimmy Carter. Only because I know it to be true would I believe such an unbelievable story.
0316067598|5.0|I have met Marcus luttrell in person and the others in this book before they were deployed and worked at sdv team one in pearl city. I have been lucky enough to have met him and thank Marcus for his service and couldn't think of a better way to help a man who has done so much to protect not only myself but our freedom as well.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|You either love him or take him for what's he's like as an actor. Decent movie, not great, not bad, worth the two bucks
B000001FRY|5.0|No, really, it is. Let me explain. I don't like U2. I think they are over-blown, pompous asses but Boy is easily one of my all-time Top 10 classics. For years I tried in vain to live with this paradox until one day I listened to Boy back-to-back with Echo & the Bunnymen's Heaven Up Here. That's when it hit me - Boy is really an Echo & the Bunnymen album and easily the best of them. Don't worry that U2 get the credit, this is the album that Mr McCulloch and co. never quite managed to pull off. It's brutal eerie, even haunting at different times and brilliant throughout.<br /><br />I first bought it for the single, I Will Follow. I thought the rest of it was OK but it was that song that really did for me. But that was more than 30 years ago and today I actually think I Will Follow is probably the weakest track on this consistently amazing record. Sure, there are plenty of hints at what was to come but it's all delivered with such innocent energy and enthusiasm, rather than the bloated excess of later years.<br /><br />If, like me, you don't particularly like U2, give this record a listen. You'll probably love it. I do.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Not a real Jack Reacher story, Cruise is a little guy who has to work hard to project a quiet tough guy
B008Y212PI|4.0|Very addictive and fun to play, would recommend this game to a friend that likes to think while playing a game, didn't have any problems with glitches
B008Y212PI|5.0|Thought provoking game and very addictive. Can keep you entertained for hours.  This is one of my very favorite apps, by far.
B001GXYBY6|5.0|This is one of the most happy, feel-good movies I've ever experienced. The heroes are heroic, the visuals are dazzling, the action is thrilling and sometimes gut-busting hilarious (if you like slapstick and cornball goofiness), and the ending makes you feel warm and triumphant. It's a classic good-vs-bad tale with enough Car Fu (seriously, martial arts with racecars) to make anyone's day brighter. I don't know why its reviews were subpar, this is seriously one of the best films I've had the pleasure of watching. If you are familiar with the campiness of classic anime then your experience will be enriched.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite series of all times. I'm an avid walking dead fan, but this one is probably one of the best!
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|Altogether, I've seen this film several times in a cinema setting and on DVD. So, it's apparent I enjoyed it. The altruism of the magicians impressed me the most. As for my DVD, the sound quality in the beginning scene is much lower than the other scenes when playing it (Now You See Me) on my home HD DVD player and when I tested the DVD elsewhere in another system. I'm not sure what caused the discrepancy in sound quality. Still, I play the DVD over and over again.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very entertaining time will pass by quickly. Great graphics story line is good runs great on kindle HD. Can't wait to see what you come up with next.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|When I first saw Young Victoria at a local film festival premiere, I fell in love with the royal romance depicted in the story. Since then, I've enjoyed it many more times.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I couldn't find season 3 anywhere, so I got Downton Abbey streamed via Amazon.  A great deal and a wonderful story.  So glad I did it!
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|William O'Brien has written a marvellous book of poems that is pure magic. Peter, Enchantment and Stardust - The Poems (Peter: A Darkened Fairytale 2) is a poetic rendering of his first book - Peter: a Darkened Fairytale. The poems will send any adult right back to their childhood and bring a smile to their face. The poems are quite simply breath taking and beautiful, I especially liked the Haiku Enchantment.<br />This is a FIVE STAR must for all poetry lovers of all ages and I cannot recommend this lovely book enough. LOVED IT!
B000Q0AD1K|1.0|I ordered this copy of this book to be used as a prop in a period play. The book I received was a later edition with different, more current artwork on the cover. Yes, I did order this book based on the cover and received something different than what was shown. Very disappointed.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is my first experience with anything streaming/casting.  That being said, this little thing works pretty well.  However, when plugged into my 4(ish) year old Samsung 40&#34; LCD TV's USB port or wall to provide the dongle's power, it really messes with my regular cable signal.  Could be the TV's processor has a hard time with it?  So, I have to unplug from the USB in the back of the TV whenever I watch cable programming.  In the grand scheme of the world's problems, no big deal, but one observation I thought might help someone out there.  Otherwise, for $35, not to shabby!  I'm sure it'll get better as time goes on.
B006S086AM|3.0|The movie is called &#34;Adventureland,&#34; but there isn't much adventure involved.<br />It's about a young man that just finished his bachelors degree, and has come home for the summer while waiting to move to New York for grad school.<br />He's one of those kids that's never had a real job before, and the only place willing to hire him is the local theme park, Adventureland.<br />He meets a seemingly nice young lady, and he develops feelings for her.<br />Unfortunately, she's going through some confused (cough whore cough) stage of her life.<br />Of course there are some shenanigans involved, and it's not all drama, but I'm not sure I'd call the movie a comedy.<br />I liked the movie, and might even buy it if I see it in the $5 bin somewhere.<br />My older brother laughed at the funny parts, but otherwise he was bored.<br />My girlfriend said she disliked it, and said it was too slow for her.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I am new to Firefly, loved it. Fox made errors in promotion and scheduling, but this show would not have made it anyway. It was and is too far out of mainstream culture. To appreciate this show one requires a level of intelligence that the general public does not have. If you are smart you will watch it and enjoy it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love me some Mahjong! Some of the tiles are very similar though, so can be a little frustrating when you &#34;think&#34; you've found a match that actually isn't, but still a very cool version. I play it often.
0061950726|4.0|It's amazing how far we have come in the treatment of our children. It was only 150 years ago that chilren were often treated as chattel and work animals. It seems to be no surprise that farm families had so many children so they had enough hands to work the farm. I know because my grandfather was one of 12 and they all worked from a young age. So what do you do when you have a bunch of unwanted kids due to the parents death or diability? You put them on a train and ship them west where families decide to take them because they have no children of their own or they need another set of work hands. There they are often begrudged everything from food to even beds.<br /><br />  One young orphan is sent out at 8. She was just off the boat from Ireland and her family has died in a fire. She has an Irish name that is changed where ever she goes. She goes from Niamh to Dorothy to Vivian. No one cares what she wants. She finds herself in several unbearable situations before she finds a caring family.<br /><br />  When she is 91 she meets a foster child who is in a similar position. She is unloved and uncared for and she's just trying to make it through the day. She does a community service project and meets Vivian and they become friends. It changes both of their lives. It's a wonderful, heart warming story.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I loved this production saw it many times in different theaters and have watched the movie starring Minnie Driver many times.  This movie really was a bit different than the one I had seen but it truly did not disappoint.  I really enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone who is a Phantom Pfan!!!
1451695195|5.0|I  bought ten copies!! 'nuf said... Gave it to everyone I love. Xmas is coming and this would be an awesome gift:-)
B00004XMTJ|5.0|Saw this on stage and wanted to experience the music and acting again.  This was an excellent choice - have watched it numerous times and will probably watch it many more times.  I consider this a great purchase.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|Does what it's supposed to do: the OEM bumper protects the edges and corners while leaving the glass unobstructed. The buttons don't require extra effort to press, and this is the way I protect my phone when I don't need as much protection as—and I want less bulk than—my EasyAcc wallet case provides.<br /><br />My only gripe is actually an issue with the design of the Nexus 4: because it leaves the glass fully exposed, I don't think this can be an everyday case for my phone. Too much dirt, grime, bumps, and grinds in my life :-)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've wanted to plan Pandora through my surround sound system forever.  PS3, no Pandora.  XBox, no Pandora.  Chromecast... got Pandora!  I have to play it through a laptop or desktop (for now), but it works brilliantly.  Love the Chromecast.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Very challenging game and love the way the pieces all come together for the final picture. Can spend hours doing this.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show. Every season has been great. I think the english acccent helps...they are so fun to listen to!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a fantastic and quick workout.  Jillian Michaels is incredible.  It is tough but only 20 minutes so not too bad to push through.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|We lived this product! Our daughter enjoys every minute that she plays in it. We would recommend this to anyone.
B00008G9JO|5.0|I bought this album on vinyl as a teenager, and loved it instantly.  It was like nothing I'd ever heard, except perhaps for parts of \\"Thick as a Brick\\", but it definitely had its own vibe distinct from that.<br /><br />I'd heard various folk rock, so-called singer-songwriter, and what I call \\"coffee shop\\" music, but this was different.<br /><br />It was electric, but also earthy.  The tunes stuck in my head and stayed there.  The lyrics were about simple things, yes, but enduring things... and modern things... and vanishing things.<br /><br />If this was folk rock, it wasn't the wimpy, whiny, cheesy stuff I'd been exposed to.  It had a texture like wood, and sounded old and new at the same time.  Soft in a way, but durable.<br /><br />The lyrics were evocative, the beats slightly off-kilter, topics ranging from traffic jams to weather vanes to the murderous secret lives of housecats.  So much to explore, so much to like!<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is not music for the pop radio.  And truth be told, it's not really music for kids.  None of my friends liked it at all.  But I've never grown tired of it, and when I want to hear it, there's nothing else that will do.<br /><br />It has aged well with me as I have aged.  I feel that I have grown into it.<br /><br />If you're looking for \\"Cross Eyed Mary\\" or \\"Locomotive Breath\\", well, you'll probably be disappointed.  But if you open your ears and your heart and your mind and take it for what it is, I think you'll really like it.  I sure have.  Looking back, very few records that I liked at the time have held up nearly as well.<br /><br />Thanks to Ian the the boys for this lovely, irreplaceable record.  There really is nothing else out there quite like it.  Five stars.
B000TDGGVU|4.0|this book.. will provide you with tools to make your busy life a little easier, by teaching some ways to avoid making small and unimportant decision making and focusing in the real important stuff.
B00B2YH7D6|4.0|Sometimes a little loose, maybe runs a bit long, but a very cool inside look at a key component of American popular music in the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, and a case study of the digital revolution (and its casualties).  I love the way it's told through and by the people who lived it, really makes the story come alive.  Plus some cool music along the way!<br /><br />By the way, if you want to learn a little bit about the guy who sold the board to Grohl, and what he did next, go to Sound on Sound's website and look for \\"Inside Track: The Lumineers\\" regarding mix engineer Kevin Augunas.  Dunno if I can post links here, but I'll give it a shot:  [...]
B001NEK2GE|5.0|As a wedding photographer, and post processing editor, I am constantly trying to figure out faster, more efficient ways of processing my images.  I found another alternative pad/system that was $500+ plus everytime you ugraded Lighroom you had to pay for a software upgrade.  This g13 combined with Paddy for Lightroom has been awesome.  Completely customizable and I have even programmed it to work with my image culling software, and not I can cull an entire wedding in 35 minutes.  This is a LOT faster.
0525478817|5.0|my tennage grandaughter loved this book, it was part of a school requirement to read a book, this she enjoyed
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Give you an opportunity to sample a slice of life quite outside of the box but at the same time reveals the sameness in all of us. Brilliant acting, fantastic Directorial skills that shine, everything is done to perfection. This is ART.
B004529NKC|5.0|The movie came in a reasonable amount of time. It payed fine on my xbox. I love the step up movie series.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I messed up when I ordered this and didn't download it.  I wanted to try out the movie at the campsite.  Instead I will watch it at home on my Kindlefire HD.  I am still learning about Kindles.  I have a keyboard, paperwhite and Fire.  All work a little differently and I am still learning.  Love all the Kindles as my family loves to read.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|The movie came in a reasonable amount of time. It payed fine on my xbox. I love the step up movie series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm hooked! I can't stop playing and my kids love it to. if you like temple run you will absolutely love minion rush!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|It came in a reasonable amount of time, and it worked. (Played fine on my computer) I love the Twilight movie series.
B00CLO3G54|5.0|I was so glad to share this movie with my daughter! It was a bonus that it was a better visual quality than when I was younger!
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|I love the step up movies series. This movie came in a reasonable amount of time. It worked pretty well.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Have always used the HP12C calculator with reverse polarity.  Have to rethink when I use a regular calculator.  Anyway, needed a new one and this is a dream to use.  The buttons are firm, but receptive and it has a lot more features which I will use, although not every day.
B0036TGT2A|4.0|While I am a big fan of the movie and try to get my family members to watch this instead of chucky, the price for this re-release in 3d is horribly over priced. I'll be waiting on a used one!  Now that I was able to get the movie for $29. I can review the blu ray. Unlike some reviews I have seen. I would say the 3d actually enhances the movie by giving it more depth. No it doesn't jump out at you, but it's a very good conversation and worth 25-29 dollars.
0767853636|5.0|Purchased for my granddaughter who saw the play.  She loves this movie!  Glad I purchased it.  I enjoyed watching it with her, she is 7 years old.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Every body is talking about it but most of the people don't know about literature. The book is repetitive and boring.
B00867HDTA|5.0|This game is so much fun. The balls path feels like I am controlling it, and can put it where I want it.
B00DYFCYSO|4.0|John Legend is one of those artist you know will put out quality music. His sound is so classically different & yet very relaxing. This is a nice cd. It works great for those times I want to just ride and listen to music. I am happy with this release, he didn't stray from what he is known for as most artist do.
B00FEN000S|5.0|I usually just rent movies and watch them once then never look back. Every now and then I come across one I prefer to add to my collection, Pacific Rim was definitely one of them. Overall it was a pretty good movie, personally I would've liked to have seen more Jaegers and more combat of them going head-on with the Kaiju but there's only so much you can fit into 2 hours when you have to balance between the story and fighting. It definitely delivers in the visual spectacle category, the CGI and effects were well done and the fight scenes set in the city were memorable. As a giant robot and giant monster movie, it definitely delivers. I think this actually would've gone a lot farther had they broken the story up into 2 movies so we could see more Jaeger and Kaiju action.
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|Simply put LOVE IT; Laura Mvula is a unique talent w/ a unique approach to music.  This is fresh, innovative music to my ears.  In an era where everything sounds the same; her voice, rhythms and sound structures are refreshing. Because of it's uniqueness I suggest listening to this twice as I did to give the musical structures/patterns an opportunity to set in.  I rarely listen to music back to back, but could not help it with this and I have since purposely set it aside to give it rest.  BUY IT and ENJOY.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|WE BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE WE LOVE BRUCE WILLIS AND HELEN MIRREN.  THE OTHER STARS AND THE STORY MAKE IT A VERY ENJOYABLE WATCH.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|I expected a super hero movie. But in this Iron Man 3, Tony always seemed to be the victium and could never fix any of the problems along the way. I think of a super hero as the hero that is out to conqure all of it. This movie was almost all negative and deepressing; rather then the hero saving the day. The end of the movie was very confusing.
B003L16FAE|5.0|The movie itself is a classic. The blu ray was a real treat because i previously only had it on VHS so the clarity was amazing. A little blury in some spots but I hear it was a hard film to transfer to high definition.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book came recommended by a friend and definitely didn't disappoint. You'll want to keep reading until you get to the end- quick read.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|These guys just keep going. There are a couple of repeats from the Vol 1 but that is OK. Like having the DVD so I can download and watch the videos anywhere. These guys are great and do such a good job bring music to new heights and views.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Just when you think you can predict what is going to happen next, something unpredictable happens.<br />Great read.....to the very end.
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|Fun combo of a rom com and sci fi! Pre teen and up appropriate. Good choice for date night-at home.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is perfect for homework.i love how you can change the mode from more advanced to easy and, when you con look at the history.
B000FA675C|5.0|Great book, so much history. I learned so much from reading this book and it kept my interest throughout. I love the character Robert Langdon.
B0035HKWLW|4.0|I have seen this movie so many times, especially when it was first released to theaters. But, my daughter wanted to see it. So, we had a movie night to ourselves and we watched The Mask. She enjoyed it alot. It's just a fun fantasy. There is a lot of shooting but not much swearing at all. If any that I can remember.<br />It has a message about just being yourself and finding strength in who you really are, not something or someone who is not really you. It's about fighting the temptation to lean on whatever crutch you have to just get by in life as opposed to just getting on with life and enjoying who you really are.<br />Yeah, I know....those themes are in there. But, this movie is over the top fun and really just a great escape for a while.<br />Enjoy it!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat.  Spectacular graphics made this a great movie to see, would watch it again.
1449410243|5.0|Bought this for my cat loving father for father's day and he raves about how funny this book is. He can't thank me enough
0786891416|5.0|I loved this book!! I am obsessed with watching Castle. This is just the best thing ever. It's like being in Beckett's mind and you fall in love with Rook, AKA Castle, along with her(:
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I had to give it one star for now.  I could not get this to work at all.  However, after asking some tech savvy people, the problem may be that my Linksys router is not new enough?  I'm not sure that this is the problem, but when or if I get it to work I will update and re-rate this device.<br /><br />I was so excited for this product.  How cool to be able to stream your own youtube and other media on your tv, right?  I'm hoping for a happy ending, with a functioning Chromecast media player... One day.  Sorry Google.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Wow, hard, fun, works great, purchased for my Kindle Fire.  I don't always the winning ability but this is definitely one challenging game.
B000026FJ6|5.0|This album is engrained in my head...I've listened to it innumerable times over the years while travelling on my road bike up A1A. This copy was purchased as a gift for a friend. Among others I favor for meditative, focused activities such as distance cycling, the flow of songs and intricacies of rhythms, spoken word and electronic soundscapes are absorbing and energizing. Mister Oldfield is a master navigator. Take the trip.
0738212415|4.0|This book arrived on time and is a great book to learn drawing.  The instructions had my teen daughter drawing from day one.
0345511468|5.0|30 years after its release, there are still secrets behind the making of 1983's RETURN OF THE JEDI. J.W. Rinzler finishes his archivist-level work on the original trilogy of STAR WARS films with this third volume. The book is stuffed with information ranging from unreleased set photos, design concepts, early script selections of key scenes (which reveal a very different film conceptually from the one that was ultimately created) and interviews with cast and crew members.  I have not read the entire book yet, but from looking it over last night (until I fell asleep on my sofa with it in my lap) I kept thinking that the filmmakers (Marquand, Kasdan and Lucas primarily) were very collaborative and key in determining the final product.  Lucas is clearly the \\"boss\\" with the vision thing, but Kasdan in particular is an outspoken and gutsy creative force. Seeing Kasdan challenging Lucas at key points is like watching a son standing up to his father, which parallels the story they created in JEDI.  Also, we see a lot of insight into the filmmaking business of the time- Rinzler goes into Lucas' financial recovery following EMPIRE which did not perform as well as hoped and how Lucas and 20th Century Fox battled constantly (to the very end) over the remaining rights and profits. It's clear why Lucas took a 16 year sabbatical from STAR WARS based on the tremendous fights internally and externally involving the making of this and the first two STAR WARS films. Yet, to see this unfold in these 300+ pages is a gift to all fans of JEDI and the series as a whole.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Works perfectly.  No issues.  Love using.  Very easy - simply tap and open your mail.  Has all the same options the computer mail version contains.
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|great love story and great acting by Julianne Hough and Josh Dumel; would recommend this movie to everyone; all ages
0307346617|5.0|Very good.  Enjoyed very much.  Offers a different perspective than the movie in the way that the story is told.  Recommend.
0399255370|5.0|My grandson loved the idea of crayons writing letters.  After reading the book, it spurred several interesting conversations about what other items might say.  One of our most interesting was the conversations that small kitchen appliances might say.  I enjoyed the book as much as him.  I can see this story being used in school to stimulate writing assignments.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Toy Story - what more can be said.  Such a great movie with great characters and the adventures of friendship they go on.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I'm thrilled to have a backgammon game to play that requires no human partner. Aside from the fact that I don't even know anyone who wants to play the game, the invisible computer is way faster than a human. And, the AI opponent doesn't get its circuits in a bunch if you put them on the bar repeatedly. The moves available light up, and that sure makes things easy on the eyes. Since I haven't played in a while, this is a great way to get reacquainted with the game and start working my way up the difficulty levels. Lots of fun to play for 5 minutes or an hour!
1577314808|5.0|This is one of my favorite books!!!! It's amazing how much different (better) life is when you're REALLY present! :)
B00005JNX0|5.0|I recomend this movie to families with children and to adults who like good entertainment in movies. This movie was very enjoyable

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am not a 'Trekkie' by any stretch but thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I found it to be even better than the first one!
B000002MG1|5.0|The CD I ordered arrived within a week, way before promised, and in great condition. I consider this their best work and love every song on it. I had it on a cassette but it was definitely time to upgrade and with such a low price for it, it was painless to do.
6305268177|5.0|Awesome!  The BeeGees at their best!
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|One of the best movies romantic/non-romantic movie I have seen. You'll know what I mean when you see it. It's one of those movies where it's better to know nothing about before you watch it.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|You can tell when a Musician had a good time in the studio, this romp is certainly<br />got to be one of Buddy's best.
0812993845|1.0|Love Sophie Kinsella! Hate this book!!! Usually re-read her novels but not this time. Not this crappy book again. Definitely not up to par.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|This Band has real depth and musicality, the dynamics, the grooves, the guitar and vocal work are<br />outstanding, highly recommend this album.
B0027MJU00|1.0|I chose this book b/c I had read Gone Girl first and it was a book that got under my skin and I often thought back on the skill of how it was written.<br />Dark Places is just that....a really dark book with violence, anger and hate. Not one character had a redeeming value. It felt like a full on rip off from the real case of The Robin Hill Murders --- the misunderstood teenagers, the satanic themes, extreme violence, etc.<br /><br />The book just felt lacking. And instead of walking away sad that a great book was finished; I was happy that the experience of that world was over.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|This needs work! I like the free space to walk in in the computer version not this path you need to follow on this one, and you feel so small in the game as well. I wish it was a better made game and more like the computer version.
B0053O89RY|1.0|I love this show, but what's the point of a 3 disc season when the 3rd disc doesn't work?? VERY DISAPPOINTED. It won't play on any of my devices, DVD player, PS3, or the computer. The disc is not scratched, but it must be blank.
B00594XOZU|1.0|IT won't let me log in . If you are having this problem too just like this since kik isn't working follow me on instagram (@obey_jwood) and we can talk about it.
B000I0XLYO|1.0|Not my type of movie. Dumb humor and the jokes seemed to repeat frequently. Some may enjoy. I didn't really care for it.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|It was a good book.  I recommend this book to any one who likes climax. Yeah so good bye bye
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Great beginning to the series Spartacus. Scantily-clad men throughout; and women too, it if matters.  What a tease! Thoroughly enjoyable; I was entertained!
B00CE5C8RW|1.0|It didn't work as it is supposed to. Is way to slow. First day of use, so didn't even last one day. Worst buy ever
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Overall, loved the Spartacus. Teasing and tantalizing to see hunk-a hunk-a men in half-clad if not less clothing apparel throughout....all the time! Nice.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|When I got it, I was expecting something much similar to temple run, which truthfully bored me. This game however... it has the minions for one, my favorite characters in the movie. Secondly, the animations are just fantastic. Even when you hit something, it's okay because of the minion's reaction. Overall, makes me giggle, it's adorable, and I love it.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|why its only running on google chrome and youtube ??<br />it should be connected right to the system so we can mirror what we working on our laptops<br />apple tv works well with me for that and i was thinking that google chromecast would do the same with small hardware :(
B000W91RUG|5.0|Quick simple great price. I would recommend this product to every single person I know and those who I have yet to meet!
0061906220|5.0|This is my new favorite book. My grandchildren love to sing along with Pete and Grammy! Because it's all good!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Chromecast is great if you want a way to stream Netflix, Hulu or YouTube to your TV screen.  But don't make the mistake I did thinking that the device would stream anything from your PC onto it.  I wanted a way to get online ABC or CBS episodes to transmit wirelessly to my TV but it doesn't do this.  Not yet anyway. Maybe at some point down the line they'll support these networks but for now it only works with websites and browsers that have a special Chromecast icon on it.
B000SJJCX4|4.0|This is supposed to be the same circuitry as the Boss tuner in a cheaper plastic casing. I don't know, but it was way cheaper and a great tuner. Just wait about 6 seconds for it to warm up and you've got an accurate and responsive tuner.
B00CX7TOTQ|2.0|After seeing who was in this, the plot and reading reviews I thought this would be a good rental.  But I found it too slow, boring and one dimensional at best.  I had to FFWD thru chunks to make it to the end and the ending gave you no gratification either.  Wouldn't watch again.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Another hit for Michael Pollan!  What an amazing book.  This puts everything into perspective not just for chefs but for anyone who eats food....and wait, that's everyone.<br />I learned so much about the origins of cooking which now explains why we have developed certain ways of eating and cooking.  Also it gives a wonderful perspective about cooking in the world.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning more about the world we live in.....and food will always be a part of it.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|This novel shares with The Shining one character (Dan Torrance, all grown up) and very briefly one location (the site of the destroyed Overlook Hotel). But in many ways this could have been a King novel about any troubled, psychically gifted character, so slight is its connection to the original.<br /><br />Is that a flaw? Perhaps not, but when you love an original novel, you go into its sequel looking for at least a family resemblance, and some pleasure in meeting old friends. In Doctor Sleep, most ties to the original have been severed. Dan's mother is long dead. Initially we have no idea what's become of Dick Hallorann, but it's clear Dan hasn't been in touch with him for a very long time. The Overlook ghosts make a couple of brief token appearances in which they aren't at all frightening and are quickly banished. Ultimately we do see a return to the site where the Overlook once stood, but through a coincidence that feels forced at best.<br /><br />If anyone from the original novel seems to truly haunt Dan, it is his father, whose anger and alcoholism have been inherited by his son. Unfortunately that plays out in too many repetitive scenes about Alcoholics Anonymous, which is great for Dan's recovery but quickly tedious for the reader. I suspect this was a case of King reliving the story of his own demons, more than bringing to life Dan Torrance's.<br /><br />Overall? As a novel about a good but troubled man and the gifted child he tries to save, it's a decent yarn. As a follow-up to The Shining, it's lackluster and not particularly scary. A read-once, whereas The Shining has been a read-many-times.
0694003611|5.0|Who does not love this book?  Thirty one years ago, it was a present to me and my new born.  I still have it, but it does not look new.  Years of my sons being read this book, and 25 years of reading to my Day care children, has taken it's toll.  I was invited to a baby shower last month and was asked to give a favorite book signed instead of a card.  I bought this and Runaway Bunny.  She was very pleased.  The other books I bought were for my Daycare.  The kids never get tired of them and neither do I.
B00A0SICYI|5.0|It's nice to see a kid friendly movie that's not animated! There is a minor amount of suspense, but it's still less than in most other G-rated movies these days. My first-grader was riveted the whole time!
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Great CD! Quick shipping, too! Loved the movie, nice to have the soundtrack as well. The free MP3 edition was a nice touch, great value!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Finally, an intelligent suspenseful drama full of intrigue and realism.  I couldn't stop watching after the first episode, I watched them all in a week!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Wakes me up just like advertised  progressive volume. I have tried many different alarm apps and this one really works just like clock work.

1470367637|1.0|I had read reviews before slamming this book, and I kept telling myself, &#34;It couldn't be that bad&#34;.  Well, unfortunately it is.  I am a huge fan of the Sookie Stackhouse series of books by Charlaine Harris.  I have them all on CD and listen to them going to and from work every day.  I'm on my third pass through all of them.  That being said, this book is the only one I will never read or play again.  I was depressed all the time while I was reading it, and it took all the heart out of the series and spiraled down until it finally plateaued with a boring, unsatisfactory ending.  I keep wishing Ms. Harris would write another book to give us an alternate ending and do something to resolve the Eric/Sookie relationship in a more uplifting way.  I will never put myself through re-reading this book.<br /><br />Sorry.  I just hated it.<br /><br />That being said, I would highly recommend the rest of the series.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|In my opinion this game will never be a 5 star game until you can trade dragons. My friend has 2 rainbow dragons and he can't give one to me. He would but he can't.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|This application works just as advertised, but it contains so much information that it is hard to see on a telephone. I wish it had an option to display concisely.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|These games are fantastic, and I loved every second of playing them.<br />Best 50 dollars I've spent in a long time.
B001HN690O|2.0|I sent this to my 4-year old grandson, so needless to say, this was disappointing.  Amazon very nicely and quickly took refunded and reshipped a new combo, but the new one didn't work either.  So my daughter gave up, and bought one that worked from Target.
1878424319|5.0|Wow this book is amazing I have shared the agreements with some of my friends and every one of them has ordered the book or went to the book store to purchase it.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Love this show! It is intelligent, funny, and very well acted. The writers have taken an iconic character and done a great job of translating him to the modern era. I also appreciate how each episode is self contained yet still expands on the continuity of the relationships between the characters.
0156027321|5.0|I gave this book five stars because it was almost new and I think I got a good deal on it!
B00DWFQ2N4|4.0|Frankly I was hoping that Part 2 would be different than Part 1 because while Part 1 was good in certain parts, I found it kind of boring and the songs were WAY too long. Part 2 is a fun album. Part 2 is about 5 minutes longer than Part 1 but it doesn't feel like it to me. Part 1 felt like it was long just for the sake of being long but Part 2 feels a little more concise. Still, some songs feel like they should have ended 3 minutes sooner than it actually did; \\"True Blood\\" just keeps going on and on and on.<br /><br />\\"Drink You Away\\" is one of my favorites on the album. It's not gimmicky and it shows off Justin Timberlake's vocals. \\"Only When I Walk Away\\" is also a really good song. I love the beat to it. \\"Take back the Night\\" is a good dance-y song and I really like \\"True Blood\\" up until the 6:30 minute mark where it should have ended because I don't think the last 3 minutes really add anything to the song.<br /><br />And just an FYI, this album has some \\"mature\\" lyrics in it and it has an Explicit rating for a reason, not just because there is an occasionally swear word. This is not a complaint just an FYI. You may want to listen to it before you pop it in the car with your kids to avoid an awkward situation.
140006922X|3.0|These style books make you question your beliefs, not reinforce them.  I do have a strong Catholic background which helped me to stay on track while I read the Author's options.  When the Author kept presenting Jesus as a follower of John the Baptist,  I questioned his opions.  Lukewarm to this book.
B007N0REX6|5.0|While I'm perhaps a little late to the party, I'm glad to see so many reviewers love this great CD--and it deserves all the accolades it's received for sure!  Slash, Myles Kennedy, and the band have made some really great music here.  It works on every level, and it's just well done in every way.  It hits on all cylinders--well-written songs, tremendous musicianship (Slash is at his inspired best, but this is truly a group effort), and a ton of energy and real passion.  Who said there's no great music being made these days?<br /><br />This is a strong CD across the board, but a few very favorite songs include \\"Standing In The Sun,\\" \\"No More Heroes,\\" \\"Halo,\\" \\"We Will Roam,\\" and \\"Not For Me.\\"  But from beginning to end, this is a very strong effort.  I have no doubt I'll be listening to this one for a long time to come.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Love this show and saw that amazon had it on prime. A smart. Town with a not so smart serif what's not to like
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Wonderful movie. Everyone should see it. It is very graffic so children should not see it.<br />We truly enjoy the movie no commercials.
B004LROUW2|1.0|I have read almost all of Murakami's books and this was the worst by far. Lazy, witless, like he was in a hurry to finish. Thumbs down.
0521189063|5.0|If you have English as a second language you must have this Great book!  It is easy to understand.<br />I'm really happy with this purchase.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|A great movie to transition from the shatner/stewart/nimoy generation to today's new generation of stars. Would love to see this team on TV as in earlier generations. A proven winner of a story line and good acting would be a great SyFi channel tv series!
0316017930|4.0|I found the book to be quite interesting, and some of the data that Gladwell pulls together to form his thesis is intriguing, to say the least. Yet, I can't say that the book was exceptional or surprising. It's very much a good book and worth reading, but Gladwell has written himself into a category all his own, and this one doesn't stand out as being any better or worse than, say, Tipping Point or Blink.<br /><br />If you've read most of Gladwell's other works, you'll find it much in line with his other writings. If you're new to Gladwell, this book is a good representation of his writing style and other offerings.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|The fictionalized account of Queen Victoria's late adolescence and early reign is very well done.  They did well to get Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend to play the roles of Victoria and Albert as they are infinitely more attractive and sympathetic-looking characters than were the actual figures they portray.  That said, Victoria did rule England and its commonwealth for over 60 years and even gave birth to an entire span of time we still call by her name.  Glimpsing within her young life even figuratively can be nothing but interesting and entertaining.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|Needs to be changed so that you can restart games easier.  Other than that, a fairly good game, so far.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I have seen &#34;O&#34; twice now and would go again.  My friend loves movies but now has a hearing problem and is unable to understand dialog requiring her to use CC.  There are not many movies you can see at the theatre with CC.  We saw this when it came out at the theatre and she was so happy.  I had to purchase it for her.<br /><br />I've seen reviews saying it's just advertisement for their shows.  Well, you know what?  More people are unable to see those shows because of cost.  This is a great way to join the fantasy of Cirque Du Soleil.
B0063GORYU|4.0|If it wasn't for the advertisements it would be an excellent game.  I especially hate the ones that don't display a way to skip the ads right away.
B007P6VM04|4.0|If you liked the show &#34;Smash&#34; you'll love this CD. Katharine McPhee and Megan Hilty are wonderful. Excellent Broadway Showtime music! Very enjoyable…
B00B1LKXZ4|5.0|i really do love dr. who, the searious is very good, and they keep you glued to your chair during each episode, I actually have to pause it to go to the bathroom for heavens sake.. thanks for making it available..
B003L7861E|2.0|I am not a foodie and that was what this book was about.  Not enough plot to keep me interreste4d
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|He loves Star Wars and angry birds so win win for him. I love how user friendly the game is and he was able to teach me how to play.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Awesome show. Whenever I am in a bad mood or feeling down I watch any episode and It makes me feel happy.
B00B7XGFO4|1.0|I personally did not like (hated) this version of Jane Eyre for a few reasons.  First, the quality of the film, lighting, sound was poor to me.  It was hard to watch and really hard to hear. The sound of was out sync.  Second, the script did not make sense at some points.  I am not an Eyre purist, but If you have read the book even once, you will feel that the movie does not make sense.  There is no buildup to the romance.  There are no looks, connections or anything. He just declares his love but you don't know why or even how. He could have been saying it to the housekeeper!  Third, the leads are so distant and cold. I know that others have commented on the age difference.  Yeah, it is funny but it would not bother me if there were some on-screen connections.  Also, this Jane is pretty sassy and not at all like the servant she was to purported to be.  And, the scene where  Rochester is talking to Bertha was just bad....I don't know why screenwriters feel the need to change this story. It is so compelling on its face.  I can understand that we need to modernize the language but please keep the basic story in tact.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|words can not describe how amazing this movie is. with an ending i did not see coming( and that is rare) the story was always captivating. if you want a fun and intense movie, this is the one. lots of humor, lots of action, and a little romance, this movie is perfect for everyone.
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|Very reliable and fast reading sd card not much USB, and charge function works good. I like this product very much.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|This movie was ok not great not horrible.  I seemed long and we had to watch twice because we both fell asleep in the middle of the movie.  The second time around was better.
B0015AARJI|5.0|baught used.  I would rather buy these used, versus new.  you can litterally buy 2 contraolers for the cost of 1 brand new controller.  makes sense. especially since these things never go out...
B009ZFPQOQ|3.0|I'm sure this app is great.  However, I've just not had many occasions to use it so far.  I'll be doing some traveling in the near future, so we'll see how it goes.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|I'm a superhero geek and love seeing movies and shows about superheroes, or the people who live in the same world as superheroes, done well. I'm glad Agents of Shield is starting off well, and I hope it continues. If it does, I will likely purchase a season pass rather than single episodes. (This is currently the only way we, as a family, can watch it on our TV since we don't have cable and can't pull up the ABC video on the TV through our xbox.)
B009LDD54K|5.0|keeps you wanting more. well filmed and written with alot of twists. Some what acts as a history lesson in some cases, someone did thier homework
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book it is my 2nd favorite book next to the hunger games. Susanne Collins is a wonderful author.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|First the processor is very decent for the price and speed ur gonna get with this chip.  You gotta ask yourself if you just want a media center pc with light gaming then this processor is great for you but if u want intensive high end gaming then its not.  I for one did not do enough research myself and bought this processor because I was stuck with an FM2 board and this was the highest processor I could buy for my particular board.  Let me tell you I dont regret my purchase but I am however stuck in a tight situation when it comes to cpu intensive games and this cpu just isn't powerful enough.  Let start with games because that is the main reason of my review, I purchased a new power supply and didn't want to use dual graphics of amd so I bought and installed a Evga Nvidia Gtx 670.  Games like diablo 3, bioshock 1-2-3, dead space and farcry 3 play very smoothly.  Games like crysis 3 playing at 1920X1080 I can only achieve high settings with no AA and cpu bottlenecks quite a bit with frames jumping from as low as 15-48 frames.  Battlefield 3 single player plays on ultra with no problems never droping below 40 frames however if you play multiplayer u will see some bottlenecking going on with alot of action especially with large maps and 64 players.  Battlfield 4 is another story it's still in the beta but my performance is horrid but yet again it is a beta so I wont bother mentioning the frames on it but its very cpu intensive not as bad as crysis 3 though.  If your gonna buy a nice mid range to high end card definally go with an I5 or above cpu, so you can take full advantage of the graphics card, thats the main problem with this cpu it just cant keep up with the card so the frame rate suffers quite a bit.  All in all this is great cpu and I hope this review helps somebody out there, take care.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Exciting and fun fiction.<br />As I got to the end could' t put it down. Stayed up way took late to finish it.

B00DAPOHU6|5.0|This CD is awesome. I just keep playing it over and over it seems.  I highly recommend all Jack Johnson albums to everyone.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This book was a profound read for me, because I lost my mother a year ago and am actually still in the healing stage.  Cheryl's journey was remarkable and the courage and strength of character was inspiring.  We all have times in our lives when we fail and this gal overcame so many of her demons during her grueling hike.  I loved it and would recommend it to anyone who is on their own journey of self discovery or just want to read a really good book!
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Action packed with twists and turns on every epsiode cant wait for season four to see what the gang has in store for them
0399255370|5.0|This is just a cute book. Duncan's crayons have all quit and left letters listing their complaints, each written in their color. My kids both love it. My first grader has read it several times to his sister. A fun book and a good read-aloud.
1623420148|5.0|Tangled is amazing!! loved it!! This book is so witty and hilarious!! We get the insight of Drew Evan's mind and what most men are thinking.. His POV and the words that comes out of his mouth are priceless!! It had me laughing out loud!! But as much as I like DREW, I LOVE LOVE his niece Mackenzie!!<br /><br />“For God's sake, don't let her watch Cinderella. What kind of example is that? A mindless twit who can't even remember where she left her damn shoe, so she has to wait for some douchebag in tights to bring it to her? Give me a frigging break!”<br /><br />“Newsflash, ladies: We can’t read your thoughts. And frankly, I’m not entirely sure I’d want to. The female mind is a scary place to be.”<br /><br />“It’s simple guy logic: If a woman is angry? It means she cares. If you’re in a relationship and a chick can’t even be bothered to yell at you? You’re screwed. Indifference is a woman’s kiss of death. It’s the equivalent of a man not interested in sex. In either case—it’s over. You’re done.”<br /><br />“The point is, when you ask, “What do you want for dinner?” we’re thinking about screwing you on the kitchen counter. When you’re telling us about the sappy film you watched with your girlfriends last week, we’re thinking about the porno we saw on cable last night. When you show us the designer shoes you bought on sale, we’re thinking how nice they would look on our shoulders. I just thought you’d want to know. Don’t shoot the messenger”<br /><br />“Maybe you’ll understand my point of view if I put it this way. You brush your teeth, right? Well,<br />suppose your favorite toothpaste is Aquafresh. But the store is out. All they have is Colgate. What are you<br />going to do? You’re going to use the Colgate, right?<br />You may want to brush with Aquafresh, but when all is said and done, you use what you have to keep<br />those pearly whites clean. See my way of thinking? Good.”

B003F44QRQ|5.0|Without a doubt in my book, this is the best vampire movie since back in the old Christopher Lee days.  Definitely one of the top 3 of all time.
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|I like this for the most part.  I was surprised that a few of the songs could and probably will be top 40 tunes.  one even reminds me of 80s new wave.  which isn't bad but just not what I expected from this very \\"out there\\" band.  several songs I really love though. the industrial sound and the complicated and sooo original music is what I really appreciate about NIN and that is still there.  and I was happy to see Lindsey Buckingham listed on guitar and there is not another voice like trent's . NIN always haunts me, the reason they are one of my favorites of all time.
B00C8RDSWK|4.0|Bought the movie used. It was in like new condition.<br />The movie itself was cute with a good story. I'll watch it again.
1451695195|5.0|This is a clear presentation of one man's experience with life after life.  I enjoyed how this writer had been a skeptic and now is convinced that there is life after life.  He regrets having not believed in the experiences some of his patients reported to him.  He considered them fantasies until he had his own personal experience when he was dead.  An excellent read.

B003EYVXTQ|2.0|Feel like being completely depressed?  Buy this movie!  Reminds me of when I lived in Southwest VA.  Gives me the willies just to think about living there.  I didn't need this reminder.  Maybe to some people and to movie critics, there's a fascination with oppressed, hillbilly life, but there are really people like this and I find that depressing.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|it is a movie about lawless behavior during the prohibition in the US, and is a great cardigan showcase. will watch again.

B007B8EX9I|5.0|This is one of those shows that keep you coming back for more and more. Outstanding actors that makes you feel that they are truly living the experience, accurate historical atmosphere and settings, and an excellent storyline... all combined to provide a drama that both tugs at your heartstrings while at the same time lifting your spirits. Not particularly a fan of the drama genre; however, this program has transformed me. Certainly deserves much more than a five star rating!
1476727651|5.0|I have all of Stephen King books and Movies he has ever made and i am soo excited that he continued with the story.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The best book I've read in years.  You are kept on the edge of your seat.  Wonderful , wonderful  book.
B00DYXBAMC|5.0|i first heard this album on Bing ( type in Zendaya full album to hear the whole thing) and being one who likes to keep track of the beats to the songs, this CD is awesome but, Zendaya also has a really, really good voice too. and her music video of the her hit single Replay is insanely good. the choreography is mind-boggling. i never get tired of  watching it. i wanna learn how to do that dance too lol. i would definitely recommend this CD to any Zendaya fans out there or just anyone who wants to broaden their sphere of music choices. there isn't a single bad song on this whole album, i've listened to it a few times now, trust me , i know lol.
B00746O3X8|5.0|I've used this harness for 3 weddings now and love it. Very secure -- even comes with tethers if you're worried about your cameras falling. Really frees your hands up.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I loved it, always a fan.  We attend, my wife and I, as many west coast shows as possible. Kudos!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Brandon, thanks for yet another amazing story.  Your prolific writing doesn't seem to sacrifice quality, and I truly appreciate your works!  This fantastic tale of super powers and humanity had me unable to put it down.
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|I have always been a Maysa fan and have always found her music very soothing. This collection of songs just enhances those thoughts. You will not be dissapointed becuase all of the songs have good lyrics and fine production values. I especially like Good Morning Sunrise and Put it on me, which she collaborates with  Jean-Paul Maurick of Incognito fame. Overall it is a very fine effort.
1451629184|5.0|This is a sad book but I honestly could not put it down, I read the whole thing the day I received it. The actual book itself came in great condition and fast too!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie and can relate to many of the occurances that happened in this movie.<br />The love story gives hope to anyone out there battling mental illness who may think there is no one for them in this harsh, cruel world.  THere IS!
B005PK56TA|5.0|I decided to watch this show after my co-workers talked about it.  I found it to be a great show and can't wait until Season 3 starts.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|I had seen this years ago when it first came out but I wanted to see again....it's really good without being corny.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Great Sci-Fi entertainment with material that didn't feel &#34;dumbed down&#34;. Special effects and sound was good without being too overwhelming.
B00F2362IE|1.0|The game was freezing my kindle fire so I removed almost all apps and freed up as much storage as possible.  I also went into running applications and shut down anything not necessary. I then opened the game  and it still, ll locks up and freezes intermittently.  My 7 yr old was so excited to see the game on there only to be completely let down by the actual game play.  DO NOT waste your money.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|the app is great for me and on my kindle fire. it is user friendly and great to use. I would recommend this app and I have it on my lap top.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|It was so nice to go on line and select books for my kindle for free.<br />I was looking forward to reading William Ryan's book.
B00EM764ZC|5.0|this works only in an Wi-Fi area and it is efficient in getting you the directions ...my kindle is great with this app.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|If you like My Little Pony you will love this movie. It's entertaining for the whole family.  My family ranges from a 14 year old boy to a 1 year old baby girl and they all enjoyed it.  Only complaint is that it's not on Blu-Ray.
B00A757EFW|5.0|this game is great and it is just like the original one and it is great to play .It will bring back memories
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it is awesome!!! you can do anything! you can go on creative or survival! you can spawn things and fight monsters!!! you can build and collect things to!! buy the game it is worth the money!!! buy it now!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is a good game and it will keep you interested in the game. Challenging at times and other times great to play
B000VE439Y|5.0|It's Monty Python. Second best only to &#34;The Holy Grail.&#34; And if you're a fan, you've probably already seen it. If you've never seen this, then you will either love it or hate it. There is no middle ground.<br />Now go write that 100 times.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you liked the first book of the series, you will love this one!  Once I started it, I couldn't put it down!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I enjoy the stories but mostly I love the use of language. I wish more writers had an extensive vocabulary and similar flare with story telling.
B004YHRZLM|5.0|Bought for my grandchildren and they love it; I'm expanding their Disney collection and what child wouldn't love to own a copy of Dumbo
B008602KQI|4.0|Very good movie, looking forward to the next two. This on tries very hard to follow the book.  I hope the next ones do as well.
B0084IHVC0|5.0|Bought for my grandchild and my son told me she has watched it at least eight times already; the rest of the family is becoming sick of it!!
1401938906|5.0|Pam Grout is a treasure. She is gifted with a writing style that explains while entertaining, which makes for a great experience. The subject matter makes sense, too, and opens you up to perhaps new ways of looking at something that has been around a very long time. It is a great book and a great guideline.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Very addicting and fun game and I'm only writing this to unlock the bonus level kbye now I'm filling up space with stupid words
B008Y212PI|4.0|Love this type of logic puzzles.  Graphics are beautiful.  Only wish there were more puzzles  available.  The difficulty level could also be higher.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|The characters were not believe-able and the stunts were way over the top.  It was okay for a late night movie but I wouldn't buy it.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|There was something about this one.  Maybe it was the Philadelphia setting.  I know people very similar to the characters in this story.  It also shows that &#34;crazy&#34; people have a right to happiness as well.
B004UPANAI|4.0|It's a fantasy but hey I like fantasy.  I've been a silver age comic fan, that's 70's era for those of you who have never heard of that before.  This was better than G.I. Joe Retailiation
B0063IH60K|4.0|For a free version works really well and love the typescof deals to coose from wish fewer adds though.  Play everyday to get my brain active and fill the time.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Good device and idea but there are still only a few applications that support it. If you are a hard core netflix user and dont have set top box, its a great deal.<br /><br />I was hoping to use it while traveling as most hotel TV's have HDMI.. Unfortunately, that wont work as the device cant connect to hotel wifi and it needs to connect to the Internet to function. Silly design decision.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I started buying movies for my grandchildren and HORTON is a great one to add to the library, the kids love it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Book was pretty dull at first, but slowly improved towards the end of the story line.<br />Love the ending... Check it out!
B000MV9026|5.0|This is great movie to add to my library for my grandchildren, They love to watch it over and over.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was great , absolutely fantastic that i do not wanna spoil it!<br />Can't wait for the launch of their next movie!
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|The BEE MOVIE is a cute and entertaining movie for my grandchildren. Great movie to add to the movie library.
B009FXIICK|3.0|The is fun for about ten minutes, for example during ten minute breaks at work after which you take a break from the game.
B005CX53RU|5.0|I expect no hassles from Amazon and I get no hassles. On time, as advertised.  Amazing how they have access to all kinds of things.
B004HXIZVC|4.0|It's a really great app.<br />Usually soundcloud apps on anything other then my kindle fire suck. So I thought here is another one to add to the sucky app list but it proved me wrong.
1401940676|5.0|A very hopeful and inspiring message.Has helped me with going through my own personal challenges. I highly recommend this book even if things are going great for you.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Realy good knive for its price!!! Its Sharp directly out of The bocks. And its good for big and smal hands.
B00DAABKQK|5.0|This film is incredible. The actors performed six characters at once. Includes stories from the past,<br />present and future. The film itself includes three directors. Although the film is great! it's actually<br />a rated R film. Includes some violence and nude content. The soundtrack, is also outstanding.<br />The main reason, I saw this film, is simply because Tom Hanks is an awesome actor, he even,<br />did a fantastic job, in his 2001 film &#34;Cast Away.&#34;
B00B9HEAVS|5.0|My absolute favorite cd. Upbeat music for dance music lovers.<br />Wish I could find more cds like that with amazon.<br />Maybe you guys read this and send me more recommendations.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really liked it, the movie is probably going to come out in the summer of 2014. I hope that the movie is just like the book!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Really fun!!! I love this game! I have another game just like it and I can't play that one! It is really hard! this one is super easy and fun!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I missed seeing LOST when it originally aired on TV, so my husband and I decided to purchase each season and<br />watch the episodes in between our regular current shows.  We didn't realize how engrossing this series is, and<br />ended up watching 3 or 4 episodes each time!
B003WUYRGI|4.0|I thought  it would be good…<br />*Dislike hated the book trust me it was nothing it's a weird book*…<br />My Dad
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works well on my TV and surprising how the party sharing (queuing up youtube videos) is such a hit with the kids. The Android interface is much better than the Apple interface (to be expected)<br /><br />Now Google, lets get some people developing other apps.....
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I like it a lot but it is slow on my kindal. It is better on the computer. I love playing it and I am so glad it is on the kindal. It is fun but difficult sometime. thanks again for letting me play a great game.  thank you.  Mary  Murdock. keep putting good games like it on the kindal and on my computer.  Thank you  again.
0307744434|4.0|I got this book because it is the selection for our book club.  Although it is very creative and pretty much kept my interest, I was somewhat disappointed in the ending.
B009K916ZK|5.0|Item exactly as advertised. Worked perfectly with my Macbook Pro. Packaging was excellent and the shipment arrived with the specified period. I am completely satisfied with my purchase.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Nice little game to pass the time.  I have this on my iphone, but this is much better.  So much easier to maneuver the little guy.  lol
034553056X|5.0|Enjoyed the action and humor of the ambulance chasing lawyers. I felt like I was living the life that they were experiencing. Made me concerned about  buying Halloween decorations for the mouth.
B007AL48UK|1.0|Didn't like the game in particular -- It's not very entertaining therefore I deleted it off my tablet.  It wasn't worth it to me
0345530578|5.0|Another exciting adventure...I would recommend this story for any follower of John Grisham or new reader. He is an easy read.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|A lot of bang for your buck for such a solid device.<br /><br />Now has Hulu Plus - tested yesterday with an iPad (can't wait til they bring it to web/iPhone as well), wish they had an option to continuously play all queued items though.<br /><br />Hoping for the additional features soon (which will increase my rating to 5*):<br /><br />- Local network playback from your computer.<br />- Amazon Prime streaming<br />- Vevo
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|My girls like it it keeps them occupied when we travel and gives them something to do when she finish her homework<br />  Thank you
B00F5FBE82|3.0|I've listened to it a few times and there are some really good tracks but this is no take care. Maybe it will grow on me.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|My girls like it  comes in handy in many ways thank you I hope you two get along no arguing to much between the two of you
140006922X|4.0|I'm sure the author is thanking all the protesting fundamentalist Christians and Fox News for doubling or tripling his book sales. The idea that a scholar who happens to be a Muslim can't write about a historical figure (Jesus) without a Muslim bias is just plain stupid. In my opinion, below the irrational criticism is fear-based thinking that someone like the author Aslan is going to shake the rock that their life is built upon. It shows just how weak their faith is. Aslan has written an intellectually credible book that attempts to prove that Jesus of Nazareth was similar to the many other zealots living in the century before and after Jesus who seethed at the abomination of Rome ruling over the land God have given to Moses. The zealots were also united in their contempt for the Jewish temple priests who were living the good life on the backs of the poor (read the 99%). To put in today's nomenclature, egregious 'income inequality.' There are also parallels to today's megachurch ministers and bestselling Christian authors/TV personalities who make a hundred times the income of the poor people who faithfully send in their tithes and offerings. Or the totally duped Christian right that continually vote against their economic interests because their religious leaders tell them that's what God wants them to do. I have read a lot of Christian church history in the past but knew very little about the first century political climate outside of the Bible or anything about the various zealots (some of which also claimed to be Messiahs) who attempted to overthrow the Romans and Temple priesthood. Aslan did a good job of presenting the details in an easy-to-read manner. The author also did a good job toward the end of the book spotlighting the strife between James (the brother of Jesus and head of the early Christian church) and the \\"apostle\\" Paul. James (the author contends) more closely reflected the actual views of his brother, Jesus. Paul wrote to win converts in the Roman world. His theology was a radical departure from anything that Jesus talked about. When the actual New Testament was finally compiled in the fourth century by a council of (you guessed it) \\"Romans,\\" Paul's theology prevailed. James was given one book and to this day, conservative theologians jump through hoops to try to reconcile its teachings with Paul's. More than half the New Testament is made up of Paul's epistles and stories about Paul. Were we all sold a bill of goods about Jesus? Just as today, the people in power often determine what we believe. I thank the author for making me wonder, and think.

1451695195|5.0|The evidence of the neurosurgeon's awareness illumined the experience of encountering the Incomprehensible after leaving this world.  Because of the neurosurgeon's critical approach to the responses of the human brain, this evidence is more than causual.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this, brings your phone (youtube,google apps) to your big screen. I will anxiously wait for more app options to fully view ALL phone or tablet apps!!!!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I was hesitant at first to order this product as I thought it might be a knock off or something. It was half-priced and I read some not so flattering reviews. However I has happily surprised to get the product in its original packaging. This is the real deal and I think it was an awesome deal. If you don't mind the pink color (which I don't) and you want to get a real LifeProof Case then this is the item for you. Highly recommend.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Very very Good movie ! Bought for my hubby as a suprise  gift  ! He loved it  and so did I !
B007R0WHMK|4.0|this was a strange movie, but had to keep watching it. I couldn't stop watching. was a bad movie though just strange
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I enjoyed the quality of the series, both in its attention to the historical details of the time, as well as the spectacular entertainment aspect. It's not for children! Contains gratuitous sex, violence & drugs... all the good stuff! lol.<br />I was left wanting more, and sad to see it end after only two seasons. Watch out for packaging! It's pretty; but, it may scratch your discs in time. Maybe store in other type of sleeves to protect your investment.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Such a funny movie. Great for kids and adults too!  My 9 year old has watched it dozens if times already.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is better than temple run...its hours of fun for anyone of any age!!! I highly recommend this game
B00005JKDR|5.0|My kids love this movie. Fun and sweet. Anyone will love this movie.  Great price too.  Can't wait to purchase the sequel.
0316228583|3.0|\\"Casual Vacancy\\" is a well written novel in which JK Rowlings exhibits her best in filling out characters and presenting scenes. We become familiar with this small town and it big political issues, all made the more prominent due to the death of one of their local political personalities. This leaves the \\"Casual Vacancy\\" on their city council.<br /><br />\\"Casual Vacancy\\" is not what one might call a \\"page turner\\", though the story compels the reader to continue to follow the lives of these characters during this time of local crisis. In doing so we also learn a lot about the personal crisis of the people we are introduced to. Their best and worst is brought to the surface, sometimes in unexpected revelations by an alleged voice from beyond the grave.<br /><br />This novel does not have the same increasing tension and ultimate action of her more famous \\"Harry Potter\\" novels, but it does build to an unexpected, although perhaps inevitable, conclusion. It is a slice of life in a small town where nearly everyone is known, to a larger or smaller extent, by everyone else. In the end little is resolved, but that is the way of things in a small town. Although in no way a mirror of it, \\"Casual Vacancy\\" presents this small English community in the same way that \\"Peyton Place\\" introduced us to the true underpinnings of an American community.<br /><br />You will find no magic wands or dragons here, (although there is a brief nod to her bespeckled hero in one passage) but there is the interaction of these disparate characters  that this author is so adept at revealing. And that, if nothing else, is worth the read.
B0040JHL3G|5.0|Very comfortable, lightweight, and affordable running shoes.  Check before you buy, make sure your shoes are for your foot type, I learned a lot about shoes and fitment before buying and it made all the difference.
B00000JFV9|5.0|This soundtrack was purchased for a friend whom I had bought the movie for a little over a year ago.  She told me recently that the film and the soundtrack go hand-and-hand, and I should know that.  Of course, I apologized for my blatant disrespect of the procedure of movies and soundtracks.  Then made the move to buy the soundtrack.  I love that Cynthia, though, at times that chick can put you through the ringer.  She scads of fun, though.  'Cause what you get back from her is true friendship.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This is a well designed product. One of the best things about Flipboard is how it handles social networks. Touching Facebook, for example, brings up all your latest news stories in a magazine-style format and automatically displays images from links your friends posted. Similarly, when you touch Twitter, you'll get each tweet laid out in magazine format, but also with linked stories similarly laid out so you can read some of the article (more than on Twitter) before touching to see the whole story. In this way, Flipboard might even be a better way to look at Twitter than Twitter itself.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|The movie is visually stunning, but the storyline was lacking a little for me. It's definitely worth a watch, so check it out.
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|I have seen the one with Mia Farrow & Redford =classy. This one had to much gilt and glamor in it to be around the<br />era of the 1920's. If you like that sort of thing okay, but I like a movie that is true to the time period. This one was not. To 21st century.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved this story!!!  In many ways,I loved it more than its predecessor. I want to hear more about A bra,please Mr King!  I tore through it in 4 days.  Time to reread!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I've cut almost every bottle in my house trying to perfect my skills!! But it's very fun to work with and extremely easy!! I just don't care for the sand paper that comes with it though, it's too coarse to be used on the glass and makes this sound that really freaks me out but other than that - I'm DIY-ing it!!
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Great case for my Canon T3. The side pockets are just large enough for an extra battery and fliters but if you need extra room for lenses, this is not the case. I  don't like to carry lenses around and I don't like a bulky bag. For me, this was perfect. Light yet sturdy.
B0077EBWVI|1.0|This was so bad I couldn't even watch ten minutes of it.  The first version was done so well and I had hopes that this would be, at least, enjoyable.  I was disappointed!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|You have to be careful when ordering this. There are many similar cords and not all of them fit the Kindle. Initially, I ordered a black Kodak cord which looked the same and actually didn't fit the Kindle socket. This white one did, however and it arrived in a timely fashion.
B007NESBK2|5.0|Simply Outstanding!! Great music, great value. All of the hits. You will love this if you are a fan. Enjoy!
0451232577|5.0|Ken Follett's ability to blend history into an incredible triology of novels is unsurpassed.  Begins prior to WWI bringing lives of different families in Russia, Germany, UK and U.S. and intertwines their respective lives as they meet under various circumstances.
B0091THRCU|5.0|I wanted a case for my phone that would protect it while in my pocket. This was just the right fit. Covers phone well and is light as well. Suits my use perfectly.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|I've been looking for good sailor moon action figures for years and they all look ugly and crappy.<br />I was so disappointed that I even doubt about this figure. But it came out right, great quality,<br />amazing details and Luna! Totally worth it! Looking forward to the other pretty guardians figures.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|This is a great movie. If you like musicals and movies, this is the blu-ray for you.  You will love it!
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|disapointed  even though mike mangini is fully intergreted  the drums sound flat and disappear in  the mix  i dont know where the problem lies ;the drummer ,drum brand ,tuning,studio,engineer ,etc.  ps  drums sound flat in concert also
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|This album is a work of art, and Josh Homme is nothing short of a maestro. Their best album to date, in my opinion.
B0091THRCU|4.0|I really like the pouch I hate having cases on my phones takes the whole point of having a nice phone so this pouch works great it's very slim I can have in my pocket easily and when I need my phone just pull the strap and my phone comes out smoothly love it
B008Y212PI|5.0|I really appreciate games that help me keep rewireing my old well worn brain.<br />Living around college kids I've got to keep the old noggin sharp as can be.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love The Good Wife series. I watched for free on Netflix. Then when the series ran out for free on Netflix, I turned to Amazon for the final series. I love watching movies on Amazon.
1426308469|5.0|Perfect for the 5 year old who was the recipient of the gift.<br />Great stories.<br />Great photos.<br />National geographic is a class act.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Lately Yahoo mail is hopeless. You can't even access your own account -- clients can't operate. One thing still works well, though -- SPAM! All of that get's through. Has anyone else had this problem?
B005FISBTO|5.0|Great season. Sets up well for the 8th and final season. The world is closing in on Dexter. Will he follow the code?
0553381709|4.0|George R.R. Martin has a marvelous imagination. His characters seem to come to life. You can't help but to love his style.
B00B52F278|5.0|It was what I wanted and more.  A wonderful conclusion to an amazing series. Wonderful action and fight scenes. Loved it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suggested by my daughter. Now have to see the movie to compare. Looking forward to the next book and movie
B005LAIIMG|5.0|This was a different twist to your typical zombie movie. Lots of great action and very entertaining. Really liked this movie.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|Sure this movie is corny as can be. But it gets five stars for great quality of picture and sound. The music especially sounds great. After you've seen this Blu-ray one time you may decide that it is best to just skip to the songs for future viewing. If you love Beatle music then this is a must.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Soooo cute and funny, I couldn't stop laughing. I remembered all the details the next day and wanted to watch it again. Colorful and full of life!!
B001UW58WW|5.0|I first saw Dave Garrett on PBS. He plays everything from opera to rock, and this cd is just the start of my collections of his music.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|I don't like Kanye West as a person. That doesn't mean he didn't just make one of the most amazing albums of the last decade. Kanye knew people were going to hate on this. He knew it wasn't going to get any radio play. He knew it was absolutely crazy. And he did it. And it was beautiful. Haters gonna hate. Who cares? They don't have to listen!!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book makes a respectable attempt to demystify one of the most influential and complex personalities of this generation. Whether you're an Apple fan or foe... this is a must read.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I'm still a fan of getting the original cd case with the lyrics as the artist put it out.  Digital is great and all- but to experience it like the artist meant is the way to go!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Big fan of the fast charger for kindle, HUGE FANS!  Hope our newest kindle survives the one year mark this time!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This was as good as any of his prior Pendergasts - more plot twists and a subtle teaser for the next book.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|I was looking to find the game for kindle, it was on there one day and now I cannot find it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks write a good book.  I enjoyed the book and also enjoyed the movie.  Good read.  Would recommend to everyone.
0307477479|1.0|If this is Pulitzer Prize quality work I highly question the credentials of those serving on the selection committee!  I transferred the audio of this to listen on my Walkman so, unfortunately, I could not speed it up.  There were whole sections (the \\"pause\\" section, the \\"PowerPoint\\" section)that were interminable and seemingly pointless.  Actually, that is how I would rate the book.  So time passes and we all change as we age - HELLO?!?!
1878424319|5.0|One quick book for reading, but very full of some of the best live adjustments to absorb.  The world should follow this wisdom......and most definitely all persons in a ruling capacity.  Anyone willing to discipline themselves to a more level-minded life should read this book.
0307730697|5.0|I could not put this book down. Everyone should read this book. It was not at all what I expected. I have bought six so far and give them as gifts. As a disclaimer, I ride with the Patriot Guard in Arkansas and I stood tall at this man's funeral. I saw his wife, his children, his brothers in arms, and I grieved. However I believe that even if I did not have a personal connection, I would still feel the same way about this book. An interesting footnote. They placed a memorial to Adam Brown on the bottom of lake Ouchita. It has had many diver visitors. That's just cool, I don't care who you are.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|After reading a few pages of these reviews, I just have to throw in my two cents: this movie was absolutely ATROCIOUS.  Let me save you some time: there's nothing new here that you haven't seen before in the much superior \\"The Dark Knight\\".  I'm simply *amazed* that so many people thought this was such a great movie.<br /><br />As a long time movie buff, comic book/Batman fan and someone who makes his living in the creative field [graphic design, sci-fi conceptual art/writing], I was left disappointed, to say the least, after the epic outing of \\"The Dark Knight\\".  Waited such a long time for this only to be let down in a major way.  In every category, from plot/story to dialogue to action sequences, this can't touch part two.<br /><br />What a mess of a story!  I kept watching, hoping it'd get better and get somewhere with the plot, no luck.  Too many head-scratching things to list here, but the choice one worth mentioning is Bane's ridiculous voice/way of talking.  Picture \\"The Venture Bros.\\" villain Underbheit-meets-Patrick Warburton with a sassy little ting, like he's saying, \\"Ooo, I'm a naughty lil boy\\".  I didn't think it was possible, but he actually dethrones Batman's own preposterous man-growl.  Such a distraction and it takes a lot away from the pace of the movie.  Soon, every time Bane's onscreen, you start to cringe.<br /><br />In summary, part one and two of this trilogy are fantastic, part two being the crowing achievement of Director Christopher Nolan.  Sad to say but these 3 have gone the way of another favorite trilogy of mine, \\"The Chronicles of Riddick\\".  Part one, \\"Pitch Black\\", was a decent to good sci-fi flick and a cult classic.  Some people swear by it.  Part two, \\"The Chronicles of Riddick\\" was one of THE most under-rated science fiction movies of all time and the best in the series.  Part three, \\"Riddick\\", which just came out, is, simply put, terrible.  A complete farce by David Twohy and has basically ruined the trilogy.<br /><br />The exact same thing can be said of \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\".  Painful to watch and way too long.t same thing can be said of \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\".  Painful to watch and way too long.

B0037MSGH2|5.0|Great show.  Not only is it a horror show, but True Blood also has wit and pokes fun at itself.
0425188809|5.0|Read this book many years ago, and the library did not have it, and am glad you did; it came on time, i am reading it now and i love it.  Great book!
B0090XLDKY|5.0|love the video  no matter how old its always a classic<br />a must see for all who like musical movies
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Good book nice read. If u like the walking dead then u will like this. It is a bit different
B00E9P959O|5.0|Count me in with the crowd that feel liberated by the clarity of this rescue remix.  Yeah you can hear so much more!!  I'll now consider the original mix CD a mere collector's item.  I could tell the songs were good, but I couldn't listen to the release other than as low volume background noise.  I never even bothered ripping it to iTunes.  The remix is a different story!  I wasn't happy I had to buy the album twice, BUT in this case it is worth it.
B00EP22QKG|4.0|Although I'm still waiting for another &#34;Bad Reputation&#34; album (yes, I know it's time to move forward), we all grow and evolve, and Joan is possibly doing that with this album...while still remaining true to her form delivering rock and roll. This is a decent record  from one the hardest working, best rockers out there.witha few standout tracks  No glossy auto-tuning or over-polishing here (sort of like her &#34;Pure and Simple&#34; album), so it won't knock through all the disposable crap currently on the charts today.  This is probably not the album that will convert non Joan Jett fans into one, and it will probably not win over young ears that don't know Joan.  But if you're a Joan Jett fan, or a fan of her type of music, you will like hearign something new from Joan , but it will not knock you off your seats. Nearly every song hits elements of her prior albums, but this is always a great thing.  Like my title said, this album is not one of my personal favorites and some of the songs (both in regards to the sing-songy tunes or the simple awh-shucks lyrics) seem, well, a bit forced. Again, I'm not knocking the artist....Joan will always be number one in my book and I've enjoyed nearly everything she's put out from her early Runaway days until now (and she friggin' ROCKS in live performances).<br /><br /> &#34;Any Weather&#34; is the clear most commercial-like single.... a fun, pop-py, rock song that has your head bobbing. I didn't love it the first time I heard it (like I did with &#34;I Hate Myself for Loving You&#34;), but it's grown on me. I really enjoy the Blackhearts version (on the Deluxe album) even more than the 606 version. TMI (which has the same sort of rhythm and sound as &#34;Treadin' Water&#34; from &#34;Notorious&#34;), &#34;Bad As We Can Be&#34;, &#34;Reality Mentality&#34; and &#34;Make it Back&#34; are fun, bouncy, rock out tracks as well.<br /><br />&#34;Different&#34; is a rock-anthem to all those out there who want to do their own thing but are constantly being told &#34;they're different&#34; .....another great with a chant shout-response refrain going on inside the tune (&#34;Live you life outside the box, focus on the things you're not&#34;....). This is one of my favorite tunes with her typical life-affirming message!!!!  ;-)  I also love the cowbell-heartbeat thump throughout the song and closing it out. She also includes a shortened stripped down version of this song on the deluxe album, which I really like as much as the studio version....I wish she did the stripped down version as full length instead of cutting it off at a minute and a half....it's a shame...she sounds great on that track.<br /><br />&#34;I Know What I Know&#34; is a fun tune which has a great message about being confident with yourself, with some kick-ass guitar work throughout, and it's made even better by the clever repeating/blending/overlapping of &#34;I Know&#34; at the end.......very reminiscent of the way &#34;Eye to Eye&#34; ends on her album &#34;Pure and Simple&#34;.  &#34;Fragile&#34; is my second favorite cut with with a haunting tune throughout the repetitive &#34;...love/life/hearts is/are so fragile&#34;, and I absolutely love the way she holds and sings &#34;fragile&#34; at a rising pitch at the end.  &#34;Seriously&#34; is a mostly shouted punk &#34;song&#34;(it should have been more singing).......sort of reminds me of her better cover of the Sex Pistols &#34;EMI&#34; (which she renamed MCA), or Blondie's &#34;Rip Her to Shreds&#34;.  Although some people seem to be on the fence with the ballad &#34;Everybody Needs a Hero&#34;, I sorta like it....her voice is sort of pitchy here, but it adds a interesting haunting sound to it.....it reminds me of a better version of her &#34;I Got No Answers&#34; ballad from the album &#34;Glorious Results&#34;.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen a few more &#34;tighter&#34; songs (both lyrically and musically) like Spinster, Eye To Eye, Hate Myself For Loving You, Little Liar, Activity Girl, Bad Time, Five, Cherry Bomb, Get off the Cross, You Don't Know What You Got etc., but all in all, I'm enjoying this album and I'll be listening to it for months to come. And each time I listen to it, I do get a bit more into it.<br /><br />Nothing really bad here from Joan, but my two personal least favorite cuts: the sort of sing-songy  &#34;Hard to Grow Up&#34; (which sort of reminds me of &#34;Frustrated&#34; and &#34;Hold Me&#34; from &#34;Glorious Results&#34;) and the somewhat forced &#34;Soulmates to Strangers&#34; (which isn't bad.....I'm just not a huge fan relative to the other tracks, though most others seem to really like this track a lot). And I do find myself humming it once in awhile, so there you go.me, Five, Cherry Bomb, Get off the Cross, You Don't Know What You Got etc., but all in all, I'm enjoying this album and I'll be listening to it for months to come.

B009MCRHH6|5.0|Very fun, mind challenging game.  Requires lots of logic with a dash of luck thrown in for some of the rounds, or for the kiddos there's a section where they can just build however they want to their hearts content.  Takes a while to finish the game, it's not something you'll have done in a week, plus when you do finish it is fun to go back and play again and do better.  Weird story line, but kind of funny, definitely original.  Absolutely worth the price.
B00CJGP116|5.0|It's been a long time since Marc Anthony came out with a new Salsa CD and this one is one of the best.  Definitely worth the wait!  Amazing lyrics and his vocals are as always superb!  Highly recommend it to all Salsa lovers.  Great Job Marc Anthony.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie is to quote a friend of mine &#34;an epic.&#34;  It's totally enthralling and the acting, especially by Hugh Jackman, is superb.  If Daniel Day Lewis weren't always handed the Oscar when he's nominated, I'm sure Mr. Jackman would have won handily.  The music is wonderful - it will be going through your head afterwards for days.  Don't miss this one.
1885167776|5.0|This newest book from Gary Keller and his co-author Jay Papasan will change your life. The idea of thinking about big and grand thoughts and achievements, but going \\"small\\" to achieve those goals, is extraordinary. This book will make you think about everyday tasks and challenges in a whole new way. I've read the book twice already and I have already listened to the audio book once. I wholeheartedly recommend this book! Buy one for yourself and buy another one for someone you love. It applies not only to real estate, but to any type of a business, as well as your personal life!
0062238868|5.0|I was looking forward to this book, and so far its a great book, very interesting read, I am enjoying it so far
B003TH2LYY|5.0|Recently discovered Castle and I am really enjoying it. It's a nice balance of comedy and drama, a turn from many crime dramas which have a focus on the dark and gritty that makes them hard to enjoy.
B005LAII4E|5.0|this is a great movie. much better than the first one. it was a great price too cheaper than anywhere around, and I got it quickly.
B008GJVEZ2|1.0|I know the Coen Brothers have legions of fans who adore their style of film-making, but at best it's merely one notch above silly.  It's a ludicrous farce which has nothing to do with the real world of gangsters, gambling, corrupt politics or anything else.  Just look at the ridiculous scenes where the police show up in mass for their violent work and you can see where shlock artists like Robert Rodriquez got their ideas from.  There's just enough characterization, meandering plot and crafty dialogue so that a shallow audience will forget that everything they're watching is a joke.  The Coen Brothers are purely commercial film-makers using competent film craft to make glorified schlock which makes every character look like a moron.
B00AB16ER6|5.0|like them on facebook, buy this cd, see them in concert.  i did and if you're in to rock with great riffs this kicks a$$
B00D5LC4GY|4.0|its a neat spin on old school tetris. Make blocks instead of rows, got it for free with the app, thanks Amazon!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the best series ever and I will be watching it again and again.  Waiting for season 4.  Love every part of it.
0312330537|5.0|An amazing book from start to finish (and it's long!) he is a great writer and his story takes you to many parts of the world.  But Shantaram is more than just a great read.  I felt like there was a lesson to be learned in every chapter.  I've given this book to many friends and to a person they've loves it too.
1577314808|5.0|A life changing book for those with an open mind. Should be read in conjunction with his other book &#34; a new earth&#34;.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Just not the kind of movie I typically enjoy, however, it is a great history lesson. Good classroom movie for older kids.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|As a fan of the original Star Trek Series, I was more than pleasantly surprised at all of the innuendos that go back to the original series. The humor, action and obvious connection of this great cast makes it a classic in the making
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|A real eye opener for those who have not dealt with anyone with a mental illness. Bradley Cooper does an amazing job in the movie for someone who is usually in comedies.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|ahhhh, i was a huge fan of their first three albums, after they the kinda lost me...songs became too long, overly-complicated, etc...i decided to pre-order this based on what i heard and read about it. i gotta say i really like it and it keeps growing on me, if you liked their earlier stuff i suggest getting this cd!
B00BUT5I84|5.0|If you are a fan of Thirty Seconds To Mars you will not be disapointed.Jared Leto continues to deliver amazing music that draws you in and takes you away while you listen to it.I love love love this cd!
B001P9EQH8|5.0|great headphone amplifier, as this is reasonably priced with sufficient gains in listening quality and power. has bass boost, volume control and decent battery life.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|If you're looking to catch good audio, here you go.  I have a handheld recorder with a mic input.  I tested with the built in mic and then with the corded mic.  The audio with this mic was so much cleaner.  Some people complain about the windscreen being hard to keep on, I didn't seem to have that problem, maybe they didn't have it on all the way or were a little rough with it, I don't know.  The lack of an LED for the power is true though.  If you research stuff before you buy it then you've already heard that this mic doesn't have an LED to show Power on/ Battery good.  I knew it before I bought it, just have some extra batteries (it's a common button size battery).  Change it out before/after doing interviews or long sessions.  The mic picks up really well, but keep in mind that it is an omnidirectional mic and CAN pick up louder noises in the background.  My experience is that in a normal setting, it picks up just enough background sound to be natural and almost unnoticeable.<br /><br />Item arrived on time and was exactly as described.  Extremely happy with this purchase.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is a book that caught my attention when it was reviewed on NPR.  I think it is one of the better books on the market in this genre.  The concepts are sound and are backed up with research and personal experience in a way that makes the principles understanding and believable.
B00E3BK0QQ|1.0|Very disappointed. Looked like it would be a good game, but couldn't even get it started.  Someone mind telling me why it does that?
B004P8JPS6|5.0|If you like a drama/thriller with lots of twists & turns,you'll LOVE this book!  Also has lots of humor and very good writing.  You have to stop reading in the middle of the chapter, because when you get to the end, you can't wait to see what's going to happen next!!
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|This is beautiful and historic music and such a wonderful product that balanced out the weight of the film. Timely arrival.  Thank you!
B000E1MTXQ|5.0|Great video quality for an obsolete piece of equipment. HD Video movies need to make a come back, unlike beta max video HD is here to stay.
B000KGGB2A|5.0|Love all the songs on this CD! This isn't sold in the USA so I was happy to find this for a good price and in good condition
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I am a pastor by profession and some time ago I preached a sermon, before my congregation and later before a group of ministers, that affirmed David had a clear tactical advantage over Goliath. David ignored conventional thinking. Many think David killed the giant with a sling shot while the text reads he killed the giant with his own weapon. Gladwell challenges status-quo thinking and that is why he is one of my favorite authors.<br /><br />I have only two critical notes. First, my Kindle app edition had the table of contents at the end rather than at the beginning. This was an annoyance. Second, the examples he provides are presented in stages. I would have preferred it be given completely. However, I am a speaker primarily and this may be my preference.<br /><br />I strongly encourage this book because it strongly presents the theory of diminishing returns. This is a lesson that all of us need to know.
6305090564|5.0|Good and creepy movie about sea snakes and bad people get what coming to them and good people get out alive
0345525558|5.0|If you like touching, true-to-life stories, you'll enjoy this wonderful book. It not only grabs hold of your heart strings, it provides some interesting facts about flowers and their meanings.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is one of the easiest apps I have installed.  Also I use it daily. Makes changing rooms easy and saves me all the dollars I was spending on HBO SHOW TIME STARR'S MOVIES
B004K8WPUQ|4.0|This is a great microphone that can produce excellent audio if it is coupled with Magic Lantern on the Canon 60D. The sound quality is very clean. The only flaw I see is that the mount to the hot shoe of the camera is made of plastic. For over $200 I would have expected it to be made of metal. Otherwise, a very good microphone indeed!
B006Q2LTRO|4.0|I had already read the book and wanted my own copy. However, your copy (likely an older edition) did not have the test in it.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire HD. Much better than I expected. I recommend it and give it a big thumbs up.
0802473164|5.0|I know I will like this book since I read the Heartfelt edition. Looking forward to it since it is a great author.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Finally a good rock album post 2002. Love this album with so many sounds of old school metal mixed with modern sounds.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm a lifelong fan of Stephen King and this book was one of his best. Danny's life after the overlook is revealed in a way that makes you really feel like you know him personally. Something Stephen King has always been good at. If you read The Shining you should read this book. If you didn't read The Shining you should read this book.  Excellent once again. Thanks Stephen King!

0030862108|5.0|The author is right, this is not a happy book, but an amazing read.  I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in US History.
B003VANOFY|3.0|It a nice looking and feels good but it goes on and off from time to time can get really annoying. If someone asked me what i thought about it i would say eh it's ok but i wouldn't go telling ppl to get it at the same time lol
B0073RSVMC|5.0|2 year old with a love of dinosaurs insists on carrying this one around with him - Schleich is top quality, recommended this brand over any other.  Solid, highly detailed, and no color/paint chipping whatsoever (the three Schleich dinosaurs he owns go in the bath, outside, in the car, everywhere - not a ding).
B005LAIHR2|5.0|i had my doubts about this movie as tom cruise isn't one of my fav actors.  this movie blew me out of the water!  the story within a story within a story was genius and to find out that tom cruise could sing and that the music was awesome.<br /><br />if you love 80's music this is a must have dvd!

B008B3MZNI|5.0|During the era of Rock n' Roll, Supertramp was one of those bands that took rock to a new plane of respectability. The talent in this band is huge and this Blu-Ray certainly shows that. I'm sure this type of music is not for everyone, but if you enjoy listening to accomplished musicians perform well written music, then this is a must have Blu-Ray. The only problem with this disc is that when it was filmed in 1979, technology was still not at its best. It is a bit grainy at times but except for this drawback Supertramp fans are gonna' love it!
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|I had no idea what this was about, got hooked from the first episode, watched all of the episodes over a weekend. This one HAS IT ALL!!!! Great story, great characters, great pace, GREAT EVERYTHING!!! If you watch just one episode you will be hooked for sure

B00BT70J7M|1.0|This singer (¿?) has no idea of what is to sing, Verdi in this case. He goes to high notes (nasalaizing), does not respect the tempo and does not follow the partiture.He supposes that going up and down, without any reason to do so, is singing This a a very distressing record. Why does Amazon sell wuch very, but very low level singer? It is a shame, so much so, that you, Amazon, didn´t dare to tag him as tenor. You called him an interpreter. And he interprets nothing remotely connected with bel canto, verismo or traditional opera. You should take him for your lists.<br />Eugenia Lizalde

B009NPA3Q4|3.0|I'm a big fan, so this album's a bit disappointing.  It's too monotonous and needs a few more upbeat songs!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|pitch perfect is the perfect feel good, laugh hard family movie. even though the rating is pg-13 it is not so graphic that younger kids can not enjoy it. because we loved it so much we downloaded the sound track as well...another great purchase.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Incredible first person account by an incredible man. His writing is direct and engaging as he was personally in video interviews for the HBO mini series on the War in the Pacific.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|Nothing but good things to say about this book! Even though I had heard about the story this book provided so many action packed details. Once I got half way through I literally could not put it down. A must read
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Accurate history and very suspenseful throughout the book. The Needle is a cold killer subdued by theo e starved heroine.

0718178130|4.0|What a fun book, entertaining in a different way with quirky characters, treating a complicated/delicate subject with a light touch and just the right amount of humor. It also contains some subtle messages about relationships and love, if one is open to them.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|came in great shape cd i mean  case was a little broke all in all very happy thanks amazon dave
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I fell in total LOVE with Eugene Hutz, a first time actor who steals the show.  He is also the founder and frontman for an Indie Gypsy-Punk (!) called Gogol Bordello, whose music is featured in this beautiful, haunting story based on the book by Jonathan Safran Foer. Best movie I watched in YEARS!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it very much. Definitely a page turner leaving me excited for more. I couldn't get enough hopefully el James continues the series

B005WKGNA4|5.0|This had a good plot, was an easy read and kept me intrested to the end.  The end was a bit of a surprise considering the time the book was written in.  I enjoyed it.
159463176X|5.0|Hosseini didn't disappoint with this story of family and betrayal. It reflects the harsh realities many cultures face that we know little about.
B005XR3K5M|5.0|Good photos and creative card making. these cards are my favorite so far. they are really nice and a good stocking stuffer.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|The characters became too two-dimentional as the story unfolded. The ending lost momentum and became an anti-climax, perhaps because i don't understand the american psyche.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|So The Conjuring may be my favorite recent horror movie of all time..... cant beat the classics but it comes to the top of the lists of the SCARIEST movies of all time! when i saw this movie i was crying and almost pissing my pants! i NEVER scream at scary movies anymore but this movie scared me so much....its realistic...amazing acting...eerie sounds and alot of jumps.....this is a typical old school horror movie....its SCARY, EMOTIONAL, DISTURBING... BUY IT its AMAZING

B006PGL7OQ|5.0|I really like this film. I have become a real fan of Michael Shannon's work. This film is really a gem. Many people seem confused as to what really happens at the end, but I am not sure why. If you watch the film closely, I think the ending is very straight forward and clear. It's really happening. Great performances all around, and Michael Shannon!!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I like the idea of this, and would probably rate it higher if more apps were supported. If you have a smart TV, or a ROKU box, you really don't need this device. I have a ROKU box, and I bought the Chromecast to use on my bedroom TV. It works well but as I stated before, I cannot rate it higher until it supports more streaming media apps.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is an amazing multiplayer  game but I do warn it can be addicting<br /> and wast a lot of time.
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|This is a brand New set of Movies.I use to watch this series every time it was showed on TV.I never missed a season.It is a great set of movies and still today it is great to watch and some of my grand-kids watch it also.It has never changed and it will always be a great set to own.
0441172717|5.0|Dune, the book, far surpasses the movies or the games. It is a brillhantly writen story, full of details and a great perspective of each character.
B009ZQFSRA|5.0|Great sci fi movie, with special effects, good plot, martial arts. music in daft punk style, along with good ending
1451624468|5.0|I found this book spectacular. I would say this should be required reading. There is also a great YouTube video by the same title which is free and covers almost the same things.
0321934318|5.0|Scott Kelby knows Lightroom. I purchased this book based upon Scott Kelby's reputation in the photography world. It doesn't disappoint. This book is not intended to be read from beginning to end, but rather as needed for help with specific issues. Scott has an interesting sense of humor and  begins each chapter with an &#34;offbeat&#34; essay of sorts.  He really makes LR understandable both for beginners in photography post-production and for those who are more experienced in post-production. Whether you are just becoming involved with LR or have upgraded from a previous version, this book will be a valuable resource for you.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|It was awesome to see all the. Right colors and the animals that were two parts. Like one would be part dog and part something else. It was such a good movie!!
B001FB55YE|5.0|This movie is the best. Always love Guy Richie films for his unique ways or filming and just the cast themselves.
B008HK3S9K|5.0|My kindle is stored in a beautiful sleeve that also protects it . I love its design and how the kindle can be easy put in and taken out.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT DENZEL WASHINGTON. NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS. HE PLAYS REALLY GOOD MOVIES NOTHING BUT THE BEST ACTOR. WATCH THE MOVIE IT SPEAKS FOR IT SELF.
B00E9P957Q|5.0|Fantastic. The Vapor Trails Remix alone is amazing.<br /><br />Rush is incapable of producing anything thats not wonderful.<br /><br />They produce it, Im buying it.
0345803485|5.0|TOLD ALL THE FRIENDS ABOUT IT. WHICH THEY HAVE ALREADY READ. KEEP DOING WHAT YOU DO CHRISTIAN GREY. REALLY IS A RELAXING BOOK.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game. Once I started playing I have a hard time stopping! It's easy to<br />give this game 5 stars!!
0345803507|2.0|Way overblown reviews. Recommend for people that have lived a sheltered life. This is the third in the trilogy.  I read them all wondering what everyone was talking about.  Very repetitious.  The same descriptions over and over.  If you make it through and enjoy the first one, there are 2 more of exactly the same scenarios.  Save your money and re-read the first book.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The author has done justice to Steve by giving detailed perspective of Steve's life. After reading this book I admire the apple products a lot. Steve was one unique person that the world will miss.
B004G606K8|5.0|An amazing classic that started an amazing world. I love this series and hope to read more. I need more words.
B009MYARIK|4.0|similar to the shopaholic book light and enjoyable, a quick read, very English terms,  funny and a nice love story
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Totally fun &amp; entertaining!  Keeps you going for hours &amp; is a challenge.  Have played over 70 levels without help from the tools.
B0035HKWLW|5.0|This is a good movie, and fits Jim Carrey's style of humor to a tee... gives him the ability to &#34;over act&#34; in the scenes without deviating from the story line, since most of the characters are outrageous and &#34;bigger than life&#34;.  The cartoon / animation mixture in the movie is well done.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie... so much so that I have viewed it several times.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is the first app of this kind for me--nice graphics and sound effects.  I find it to be relaxing and engaging--try it, you'll like it!
0399159347|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I Thought this was a great read. Went on and bought her order books too!
B004U7JYXS|3.0|Ordered enough for 200 pictures but everyone of the boxes expire at the same time.  I am not sure if this type of film has a short life or if the business unloaded a bunch about to expire.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was excellent reading and a must for any dog lover..makes you realize our dogs are our best friends!!  Loved it!
B00594XOZU|1.0|I have been using this app for a long time now. I logged out once, and it won't let me log back in. It keeps saying it's taking longer than usual. Please fix this app.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Tryed the app, but it didn't work. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. The app just tries to start up and then locks up.
B00EMZYBRC|5.0|Love it but it sucks so bad that its censored. Anyone know where I can buy a non censored version? I can't stand the skips during songs
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Consistent light output and recharge time.  Cheaper and simpler to use than the SB-900.  A perfect choice for a semi-pro photographer on a budget.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|OMG... This film was a HOT... HOT... MESS1! The refrigerator had me in tears. OMG I was cracking up. Oh goodness. It's not for everyone. If you dont have certain personality and sense of humor then it will miss you like a particular Quinten Tarintino film has missed most people who saw it. This is one of the most bizarre, strangest, craziest films Ive ever seen. Oh goodness, but I LOVED IT!!!
B009NH6JRE|5.0|I realy like the series and i hope the forth one will be as great.<br /><br />But, i don't know who is the delivery service for amazon but they are so stupid !  My package was left in front of my house where anybody could have steal it...
B004N8CP8K|4.0|using nextbook 8 :) only thing I don't like is the audio doesnt seem to work, amazing to control my servers with my tablet. Very cool app!
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|The gameplay is the best of all the angry birds games, easily a 6 star game, but it lags so much that it sometimes deletes itself. also, little colored rectangles appear all over the screen for less than a second, many at all times. However, I congratulate rovio on their greatest game yet.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|If you are a SF fan, then you know &#34;redshirt&#34; usually means the character wearing it is expendable & usually dies a horrible death. John Scalzi take this premise and spins a highly entertaining, engaging and thoughtful tale. Be careful that you don't get whiplash following the characters, back stories & time-jumps. This book made me want to read more by John Scalzi. Can't wait to see what he does with H. Beam Piper's Fuzzies in &#34;Fuzzy Nation&#34;.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Better movie than I expected. I wanted creepy without a lot of gore and this movie delivered. I might watch it again.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|It has been a long time since I read a David Baldacci book and a friend was highly recommending [[ASIN:B00A6JLDJ2 The Hit (Will Robie)]].  Since that book follows this one and I always try to read books in the order written, I picked this one up first.<br /><br />One thing I will always say about Mr. Baldacci is he keeps me guessing.  Not full of blood and gore like other writers seem to rely on; there isn't the \\"eeeh gross\\" factor with his books as much as good old-fashioned suspense.  While this story kept me guessing, I didn't find myself unable to put it down.  It was a good read but I could forget about it until the next time I went to pick it up.  The best books in this genre have me thinking about them when not reading and I didn't reach that level of interest this time out.<br /><br />Good but not fabulous --- a solid 4-stars.
B004RCUJ9E|3.0|I enjoy this game. Its a little quirky when playing against the computer but like I said, it's an okay game.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Story is so contrived the viewer feels badly manipulated by the writers.  Despite the presence of able actors (Caine, Freeman), the acting is flat.  PG-13 constraints made it feel like TV.  Engaging but disappointing.
B00464F19Q|5.0|One of my favorites!  I like it so much I decided to write my psychology report on it!  Every one who watches understands, maybe even personally, the seven deadly sins....
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I highly recommend this new music.  John Mayer has bravely ventured out to new musical styles and sounds and hit the mark every time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is such a great story!  I could not put this book down - I really liked the different points of view from the characters and how their lives intertwined.  This is a must read!!
B00E6F155E|5.0|they were prompt, the packing was good and cd as described. would use again. the video's dvd was a good bonus- though I already had it.
B005723JSQ|3.0|This story is cute, funny at times. I read it on a long plane ride.  The main character is a bit annoying towards to end when she does not get it, but that seems to be a revolving theme in Kinsella's novel.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game has given me hours of fun.  It always gives me something to do on my down time.  I enjoy the different things that you can purchase to enhance your game play as well.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|Very good action moie right from the start Chris Pines is great as a young Jim Kirk...Spook and others were very well portrayed..
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|This app works great for my Kindle Fire HD. I never experience any of the complains that some of the Kindle Fire HD reviewer left for this app. It could be that it was already fixed when I downloaded this app.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I loved everything about this book and am looking forward to Drums Of Autumn. Diana Gabaldon is a splendid story teller!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|If you enjoy Tarantino or Westerns this movie should satisfy your palate! A very good film with plenty of action and great dialogue as well!
0425266060|5.0|I thought the book was tastefully written.  I passed it on to my co-workers and they loved it too.  Very enjoyable
B009LDD590|5.0|This is one of my husband's favorite series.  HE HAD TO HAVE IT as soon as it came out.  It will not disappoint.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This app is excellent  to use. It has helped me a lot especially for school and it is so easy to manage.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|my husband is dressing up like dr.who for halloween after watching all the seasons on netflix! Can't wait to him all dressed up!
0064430170|5.0|My son loves this book and reads it along with me.  Such a classic bedtime book to read to your kids!
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book is amazing, and something everyone should read at some point in their life. You absolutely fall in love with all of the characters, and Mitch Albom's writing is beautiful.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My three year old loves this game and is actually pretty good at it.  It challenges him to find the right path.
0143038419|3.0|I really wanted to finish this book before the movie came out. Life got in the way and it took me a loong time to finish. It started out great as I most enjoyed the Eat part of the book but my interest started to wane by the time the end came around. In fact, I was so bored by the end, I didn't even care to watch the movie.
0060935464|5.0|My daughter and I loved this book.  Harper Lee is an amazing author and it's a book everyone should read!
B00439MV42|5.0|Awesome movie highly recommend it to anyone. I am a 80's movie fan and if you are you will love this
B000002KHH|5.0|One of the timeless classics that I am so glad I finally own. Looking forward to tracking donw many more in the future and adding to the collection.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I enjoy the mix of traditional classical music and folk and popular songs. Their style and sound is uniquely enjoyable.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|It`s does every thing they said it would do...you close it, it cuts off, you open it, it`s on again. I love the rotation.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Soothing, their obvious love of the music adds to the enjoyment. It's a great way to travel and relax, but the video adds to the enjoyment.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Well written. One of the best mystery thrillers I have read in some time. From beginning to end, page by page the book was difficult to set down. Looking forward to next adventure, I am hooked.
031623480X|5.0|This book is extremely well-written and well-documented about the deleterious effects of grains and sugar. It's tragic that we've been led to believe that saturated fat is harmful and whole grains are necessary. It's the exact opposite. This book is so important that I've been imploring everyone I know to get it asap. I finished it last week and, since implementing the diet, have lost weight, gained energy, eliminated brain fog and increased overall well-being.
B004HW7JH4|4.0|not as good as previous seasons... but still hanging out for season 6!<br />Betty not true to character and not enough scenes include her.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game gets you thinking, especially as the number of squares per line/column increases. Really surprising how quickly the time goes by once you start.
B00DU77QP2|4.0|If you enjoyed Twilight you should enjoy this story. It's an ongoing story and it's a fun easy read. Slightly more action orientated with less than immediate romance than Twilight.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|the main is an interesting and unique character. the story is related through a series of tales of his past (told by him) and small steps in a current plot.  neither are boring. also through songs/folktales the author gives a fullness to the place our character lives in w/out bogging down the story.  i was so pleased to know the 2nd in the series was also available since i was looking forward to see what happens next.
B007V65R54|4.0|Silver's book is ripe with anecdotes about the difficulty of prediction. It is worth reading for anyone who wants to be able to give real life examples of machine learning and Bayesian statistics in action. It is also highly recommended for those uneasy about exaggerated claims on the promise of big data.
0736698620|5.0|O'Brian was in a class of his own when it comes to nautical writing...But one truly must hear the words to appreciate his talent.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I don't remember buying this but I LOVE PLL so 5 starts LOL I recommend the show to younger viewers because it can be conceived has phony and unrealistic but to me, that's the fun in it.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|This app has some serious glitches.  Will not load after most recent update.  Great game, but cannot play it anymore
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|I love Drake.  This album sounds much different than his previous music but, in my opinion, is much more refreshing.
B000P0J09W|3.0|Remember watching this as a kid. Did not realize at the time there was so much profanity and questionable subjects talked about. Will not let my kids watch it.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I chose this rating because this is an actual account of the ordinary lives of people living in a secretive state.  It makes clear what has been and continues to happen in North Korea.  It's amazing what the human spirit can endure and mind-boggling how those in power can treat their own people.  Unbelievable how the whole outside world seems to be unaware of the conditions in this cruel place and allows it to go on.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the second book I've read by this author and as in the Kite Runner it is not necessarily a happy, feel good story. Mr Hosseini taps deep into the tickings of human beings - their emotions, justifications for actions, etc.; The struggle between right and wrong and how easy it can be to justify actions but ultimately the long-term consequences of ignoring one's moral compass. This book made me sad enough to want to cry many times but it did also have triumphant/redemptive moments. I highly recommend it.
B008645YEE|5.0|ok
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|I really liked \\"Outliers.\\" It made so much sense. A smart person gets a lucky break (or a series or lucky breaks), he works really, really hard and succeeds. Malcolm Gladwell's stories of Bill Gates and The Beatles have stuck with me. I really like and admire Gladwell, too. The guy is so darn intelligent and explains everything is ways that just make so much sense. So why was I disappointed in \\"David and Goliath\\"?<br /><br />Partly it was because Gladwell has developed such a well-deserved reputation and I set such high expectations for the book. Don't get me wrong: as with almost anything Gladwell writes, he provides plenty of interesting thoughts to ponder and he's a great writer. But I felt that he was stretching to find the good in dyslexia or losing a parent during childhood. I'm not knowledgeable enough to question his theories or stats or the number or studies backing up his points. I'll leave that to more expert people like Christopher Chabris, a psychology professor who found plenty to question in a September 28th \\"Wall Street Journal\\" book review of \\"David and Goliath.\\"<br /><br />Early on Gladwell says that \\"'David and Goliath' is a book about what happens when ordinary people confront giants.\\" He goes on to relate tales of admirable individuals, not all of them famous. I didn't see the cohesion of the points he wanted to make the way I did in \\"Outliers.\\" I've come to expect uplifting inspiration from Gladwell. I didn't come away with much of it from \\"David and Goliath.\\" In the end, it was an enjoyable enough read, I learned some things, it provoked some interesting thoughts and I'm still in awe of the man's intelligence.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game, it challenges you to think and to try and beat the game, gives your mind a challenge when you have had a hard day at work.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I purchased this CD having only heard 1-2 songs prior to ordering. I love the entire album! Has plenty of catchy songs; great for summer driving.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|Not much more needs to be said.  This movie shows how it's really great story and screenplay writing and not computer generated, special effects or explicit sex that makes a good movie.  See it while you can.
B00ANAC32U|4.0|This is the only case I've had for this phone, so I can't really compare. It doesn't follow the lines and curves of the phone as well as I'd like (mostly the curved edges of the glass), but the metal ring makes it look almost like part of the phone. The buttons are great and feel stock.<br /><br />I it's pretty hard, so I worry about how much perfection it provides, but it's probably better than nothing, and the lips all around lift the glass off of tables.
B000002LAC|4.0|I enjoy listening to these three singers when they sing alone so I was curious how they would sound singing together. Each of them is adept at harmonizing and I thoroughly enjoy the CD.  There are some songs on the CD that I skip because I don't enjoy them as much as the others, but the ones that I do enjoy make it all worth-while.  For a country-music lover, this is a pleasing addition to his/her collection.

B008HK3XU4|5.0|It is purple and what female doesn't like purple?  It fits good and was easy to put the Kindle in.  It does the job.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This tribute was a loving homage to a wonderful musician and a unique human being. I wish I had been able to meet George, but I think I knew him through his music and his life story.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I don't know what else needs to be said about Angry Birds. Remember...you haven't beaten the game until you have all three stars and collection items from every level.
B00005MP58|5.0|this version is my favorite... it is about 5hrs long, but I always keep it on my iPad, so i can watch it whenever i travel.  usually the person sitting next to me on the plane says, &#34;oh i love that one&#34; and tries to watch with me (even though they don't have sound)
B001BANK32|5.0|I love Stephen King and have read almost all of his books. Now that I have the kindle and kindle app on my phone I can reread his stuff. I just wish that they were all $3 or $4. Buying books gets spending when you read as much as I do. And the library isn't always an option.
B00CM03H4C|5.0|love lana del ray and Florence the machine on this cd great artist fergie song too good so buy and party
B001HN6922|5.0|Great movie, the kids liked it as much as the first one. Can't wait to see the next one or two.

B0034G4P26|4.0|We bought this for our grandson, he really likes it, when he is over he will request that we watch this.  it is a fun little movie that I think all kids would enjoy.
1574214276|5.0|Exactly what I was hoping for. Very good info. Lots of tangles, lots of ideas for coloring, shading. Glad I purchased it.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|Everybody knows that The Little Mermaid is classic Disney, so I'll skip the movie review for now. I just want to say that the BLU RAY transfer is really gorgeous and comparable to some of the best Disney BDs I own, such as Beauty and the Beast and Alice in Wonderland (1951).<br /><br />The whole color palette is signature Disney and really pops in 1080p. It doesn't look too digitized though, as Disney will sometimes do. It looks classic. Soft where it should be and very sharp when it should be too. I've seen this movie probably 100 times, but I can honestly say that watching it in full HD was like seeing it again for the first time. Without HD, you don't really how much ART was put into the movie. Some of the backdrops literally took my breath away.<br /><br />As for Audio, it is flawless as well. Delicious surround-sound water noises, fabulous orchestral musical numbers, deep thunderous booms for Ursula. It probably won't show off your system like a super hero movie, but it does sound really, really, really good.<br /><br />I don't have a 3D TV yet, so I can't comment on that yet, although my friend does have one and he said that the 3D transfer was a little lame. Mostly depth and atmospheric effects, not a lot of pop. I'm okay with that, not really a big 3D guy anyway.<br /><br />OVERALL: Disney lovers, HD fanatics and anybody else - this is a must-have for the collection. HIGHLY recommended!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|It's wonderful!<br />My son likes it at first glance!<br />I like it,too!<br />I would be likely to buy it for my nephews.
0525478817|5.0|This book is about a young girl named Hazel Grace who has cancer that falls in love with a boy named Augustus Waters that also has cancer. They go on a trip together but I'm afraid that is but all I can reveal because all the little things are connected. You must read the book yourself to find out how the twists and turns play out. I could definitely not put this book down after just one chapter!
B004SGWYW4|5.0|High School of the Dead is one of my favorite animes out there great buy you won't regret buying this if your a fan of anything zombie related.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I started watching The Big Bang Theory earlier this summer and feel in love. I wanted to get caught up with the series before the Season 7 premiere this fall so I decided to buy every season. The price was good and I had gift cards to pay for them. Love the special features and bonus content and especially the gag reels. I don't know why I didn't start watching this show years ago. Its gotten funnier over the seasons and this is definately my new fave show. Delivery was good and it actually came before the actual delivery date which was great. Here's to Season 7 of the #1 Comedy on TV (even if it lost to Modern Family at this years Emmy's).
B000W1MEFG|5.0|Beautiful album. Transports me to a distant place. Fantastic renditions lovingly rendered. I am so very grateful to have this recording.

B00F91H15W|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br /> When I saw 'Lost in Translation' a few years ago, I wrote Sofia Coppola off as a complete neophyte and someone who was riding on the coattails of her famous father. Now I must grudgingly concede that Ms. Coppola has markedly improved as a director. 'The Bling Ring', based on the true story of a bunch of California high school students, who burglarized homes of rich celebrities, has the look and feel of a well-crafted music video. In fact, Coppola employs a slew of contemporary tunes (mostly rap), that give the film its raw edge.<br /><br />The story is rather straightforward, following the basic facts of the case against the amoral teenagers who commit the 'bling ring' burglaries. The main anti-hero protagonist is Rebecca who befriends Marc; both attend a high school for underachievers and dropouts. When Marc mentions that one of his well-off acquaintances is out of town, Rebecca has no qualms about convincing him to burglarize the acquaintance's house where they make off with a handbag, cash and keys to the victim's Porsche, which is used to go on an extended shopping spree.<br /><br />Marc and Rebecca meet up with her airhead friend, Nikki (well-played by Emma Watson) and her two adopted sisters and bump into celebrities Kirsten Dunst and Paris Hilton at a nightclub. Marc and Rebecca realize that Paris Hilton is out of town while doing some research on the internet and they then concoct a plan to burglarize her home.<br /><br />Paris Hilton gave Coppola permission to use her home for filming the burglary scenes and one comes away amazed at just how many clothes and 'bling', Paris Hilton owns. Hilton's home is burglarized by the Bling Ring on multiple occasions and other celebrities are targeted including Audrina Patridge, Megan Fox and Orlando Bloom.

B003L77G6A|5.0|I started watching The Big Bang Theory earlier this summer and feel in love. I wanted to get caught up with the series before the Season 7 premiere this fall so I decided to buy every season. The price was good and I had gift cards to pay for them. Love the special features and bonus content and especially the gag reels. I don't know why I didn't start watching this show years ago. Its gotten funnier over the seasons and this is definately my new fave show. Delivery was good and it actually came before the actual delivery date which was great. Here's to Season 7 of the #1 Comedy on TV (even if it lost to Modern Family at this years Emmy's).
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Wonderful, eclectic -- some of his lyrics hit the heights of Leonard Cohen's, and that's high praise, indeed.  Loved it.

B00EOO55GW|5.0|This is solid from start to finish, i can't help feel like this is the modern day Guns - n - Roses.  There are some songs in this CD that put me in a time warp to the 80's and 90's but they kept it all A7X....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 9 year old grandson loves this game. He says it rocks! He plays it all the time and loves the challenges it gives him.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Wonderful cd. Its inspiring, great wonderful lyrics that one can relate to. Very rich sounds and very alicia keys with a new re invented style.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Purchased for my mother and she loves it.
B00503BN1M|3.0|Definitely not Portman's best effort. Plus, her and AK seem to have very little chemistry. This movie was just good enough to watch til the end.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|Excellent movie arrived in excellent conditions. Was little when I saw this movie for the first time. Resided to buy it to keep it as a memorabilia.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book pretty much picks up where the first left off.  So it may be wise to read this book after completing the first book so you know what's happening.  The author does a wonderful job in detailing the scenes.  Yes, there are sex scenes, but there is so much more this time around.  We have vandalism, attempted murder, and more.  We get a better understanding of where Mr. Grey comes from; what is in his background.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a very addicting puzzle game. And the different puzzle sizes adds enough of a challenge to keep it interesting as it increases the difficulty level. Great app. I look forward to trying GabySoft' s other puzzles.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Yes, there are sex scenes in the book.  If you can get past that, you will find that the book is very well written and the story line is beautiful!  The sex scenes are not too bad.  I mean, the language is clean, for the most part.  The author uses words such as sex and erection instead of pussy and dick to refer to those particular parts of the body.<br /><br />Ther eis a mystery to solve in the stpry line as well.  The end left me hanging and I was glad that I purchased the whol trilogy at once.  When I reached the end, I moved right into the second book.  (I have them on my Amazon Kindle, not paperback or hardback form.)
1439110123|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  I lost my original hard back and was really happy to be able to get this soft back edition.
B003UUFH5A|5.0|After reading D. Allen's very helpful review, I decided to seek out the better version so I bought a CD that was a hybrid SACD. The album is just awesome, I can't stop listening to it and inspired me to start adding to my small jazz collection. Since the SACD is quite a bit more expensive I wondered just how much difference the mastering really makes, so I bought a used regular CD version to compare side by side. Let me just say, the difference is night and day. I have decent equipment to listen on, but I'd bet I could easily tell the difference even playing them in my car while riding down the highway.<br /><br />D. Allen explained the difference well, I just want to add some info to help you get to the better mastered version which is worth every penny. The same reviews seem to be under both the CD and the SACD including D. Allen's but I'm sure he is only referring to the regular CD. I'll try to post pictures of the back of both so everyone can tell the difference, but the SACD says \\"Mastered for SACD by Kevin Gray and Steve Hoffman at AcousTech Mastering, Camarillo, California. The regular CD was remastered in 1998 by Rudy Van Gelder. The ASIN for the regular CD is B00000I41G and for the SACD it is B003UUFH5A.<br /><br />And Thank you, D. Allen, for your review.
B000AARKOO|5.0|This movie is great to watch, not only you learn something from the past but mostly portrayed accurately.  Very enjoyable and exciting - this is a must to have and will recommend highly to my friends.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|Great Book to give to friends and family who need to learn about Michael. This book is written from a perspective of respect, in my opinion. I have read almost every book out there about Michael Jackson over the past 4 years and there is usually this undertone that is just not so pleasant and its refreshing to not have that there as I read the pages in Defending a King. This is a great book for people to get to know the Michael Jackson that his fans have grown to love and know. Thank you.....Jenny Applehead
B00F5F0208|5.0|I love this album. I particularly like the creative writing, the transitions between songs, and the variety. Drake really did a great job with this project. He shows a lot of himself, without many collaborations. For any collaborations that he includes, I like that they aren't mainstream artist who are already on top of the market. Of course there is always at least a couple main stream artist that make guest appearances, but he doesn't have features from beginning to end. Keep up the good work!
1401235417|5.0|THIS IS IT,<br />You will not put this story/book down!!<br />Pick it up in HC format while Amazon still offers it.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My son turn 9 and loves Minecraft so this was an easy purchase for him. He was so excited to have this. The only thing I would suggest or want is maybe just selling the characters, either in a group or individually they seem to be the big thing.
B00DY951RQ|4.0|lovely presentation, in particular the photo part but sorry, I can not hear a difference between the remastered and original self portrait album, however I love both. well, then there is the Isle of Wight Concert.......this is certainly of historical value but nothing else !
B002UM5BXW|4.0|This is a great book. I'm not a huge foodie or anything but this book made me really excited about food and trying new things. Anthony Bourdain is a very talented author and witty story teller.
B00915G6MG|5.0|The tenth season DVDs were great it was wonderful watching the season again. Would recommend this to everyone. ready for Season 11.
B000002J6F|5.0|Stephen Stills at his best, with a very tight band. Some of these songs are still very current. Buy this album.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This works great and I love the length of the cord.  I can keep it plugged in while I read in bed.
0156034026|5.0|Great price and great book. Very entertaining. A must read. One of my favorite authors. Really helps to understand the situation between US and Pakistan.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book and every other crossfire novel by Sylvia day! It couldn't have been a more fun book to read!
8184776217|5.0|Perfect last part of the trilogy!<br />Even better than the first two!!<br />Looking forward to the movie, hopefully again with Jennifer Lawrence!
B003XURDAY|5.0|It was a little different verson from the one I had on VHS, but it was just as good and the quality was excellent.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Good app you can get  your music anywhere in your pc, movil & the cloud. Good quality enjouyyour favorite artist with good quality sound
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love the game. I just wish there was more levels. The p lot to the story was interesting and good graphics.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Dumb ways to die is a fun app for kids, bu don't let them play it's sister game! It features gore and over the top deaths.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I'VE BEEN A FAN OF NCIS SINCE THE BEGINNING. I NOW HAVE ALL TEN SEASONS SO I CAN WATCH THEM WHEN I WANT TO. THE QUALITY LIKE ALWAYS IS GREAT.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I have never read a better book by Brandon Sanderson. I liked it more than JRR Tolkien or Orson Scott Card. An incredible book. Just read it.
B009R659L8|5.0|As always, this book did not disappoint.....Enjoyed it very much and will probably read it again on down the road......Highly recomend it and all books Mary Higgins Clark writes, if you like mystery.....you'll like it!
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|I haven't wrote a review in a year, so that says something right there about this album. This is the album we have been waiting for this is his best album hands down he keeps getting better. I personally think he is one of the best rappers out there right now he is the next generation i've been following him for 7 years now. i'm so proud of him from degrassi to nothing was the same is such an accoplishment he is just going to get better. I don't listen to rap and hip hop anymore but he is one of the artists that stands out from the rest. Must have album of the year. His lyrics have truth and his beats are sick. Every song on this album is great.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|Just got this in the mail the other day. Out of the box it looks good, has a nice style but a bit flimsy on the grip. For the price you can't beat it and it will do the job I am looking for. Which is follow shots with short lenses.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|My 5 year old was so happy to get this in the mail. He loves Blake Shelton. If he had his way he would play the CD all day everyday
B001PPLKI0|5.0|I own I Believe myself and I felt the need to purchase one for my mother because of how wonderful it is. My mother is enjoying<br />I Believe very much. She said that Elvis has all the right songs included in these cd's. All the songs are very inspirational and uplifting.
0321701763|5.0|This actually wasn't the book I needed . However, it is still up to date with the newest version. It is identical except for two lessons.
B009G56RN4|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing in this movie. Gut-wrenching and sad this movie is a brutal accounting of what greed may have looked like in that era.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A nerd's paradise! Made me want to go back and take careful note of every movie, book, song and game mentioned, then make my way through all of them.
B00DHHWYAW|3.0|So much more could have been done to make this an exceptional movie.  What were they thinking when they combine a 1920's setting and play Jay-Z music?  By and large the acting was good but not exceptional.  Even in 3D the story seems implausible although the picture clearly displays the grandeur of the times.  The movie is fun to watch once but not one I care to see again.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|The Great Gatsby was fantastic! The scoring of the film was phenomenal and the visuals were stunning! I encourage everyone to watch this movie.
1609611543|5.0|A very revealing book. No wonders cancer is of plague proportions. Thank goodness there people willing to speak out in this manner.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|Such a great movie with a great central theme. If only real people could see each other like these teens saw each other by the end of the movie.
B000P407K4|5.0|My 15 year old has been watching nuclear bomb documentaries and so forth. &#34;Now for the real thing&#34; says I. &#34;Kubrick really nails the paranoia rampant growing up beneath the Shadow!&#34;
B008J05EL8|1.0|After purchase the app would not open. If you read other review of this product, it is obvious my experience is not an isolated event.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Changes my whole thought process and outlook on life! I had the opportunity to see Don Miguel and his son live. The experience was equally thought provoking. Their live and support of one another was truly a testament to their teachings.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|I have been a fan of The Walking Dead since the beginning. The third season on BluRay delivers it all.
B003YUF0GC|3.0|I wanted a usb GPS to replace a old 12v Garmin.  This Prolific-chip based unit does not work for UIView, in my mobile situp.  Went back to the Garmin.  .  This GPS seems to work fine in other applications .
140006922X|4.0|I find his style appealing. He takes what could be a much overworked subject and pares it down to it's essence.
1932100660|5.0|I ordered this book for my wife from a friend's recommendation we met on the Euro trip.  The price was reasonable.  The content of the book was very good, according to my wife, and it's all about healthy eating lifestyle suitable for all adults.  Lots of studies were done in China on organic vegetables and fruits, and the findings were very practical for daily usage.  Strongly recommend it.
B000ION79Y|4.0|This was one of his older movies and it was really good but not one of his better movies, but if you are a fan it is a must see for yourself movie.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|My son's favorite Iron Man movie so far.  We've already seen it twice since buying it a few days ago.
B00ECLU346|3.0|This movie was just... meh. I wanted to love it, but it just wasn't as funny as parts One or Two. I'm glad it was the last in the series.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Love it, can't stop playing, probably because I'm a big fan of puzzle game. Yet be careful, I lose some sleep coz I can't stop playing
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Too long, too slow. Not very interesting although not really boring. Takes way too long to get to the point, which isn't all that new as a concept.
B00594XOZU|1.0|So i looked at other comments and it seems other people are having this issue. To me it looks like kik hasnt fixed it which js stupid. I can sign into my account nor make a new one. KIK FIX THIS NOW
B008476HBM|4.0|This was a great book to read on my Kindle phone app, while waiting in line, during appointments, or relaxing in my downtime.  I'd seen the movie, but had never read.  Many more classics on my bucket list.
B004KKX80A|5.0|I love it it has a  lot of stamina and I recremend it to 11 year olds and it should be treated with care
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|Being an EJ Fan since 1971, I've followed & collected EJ for Decades. Seen him in Concert at least 100 times-always puts on a Fantastic Show. His New CD is back to the 70's. Home Again is the Single & throughout his career of up & downs, he's always been a fighter & &#34;a true survivor&#34;. You are &#34;Blessed&#34; Sir Elton! THANK YOU for all the Entertainment & joy you have given me!
0375812024|5.0|Our grandson loves both Richard Scarry and airplanes, too, so this book was perfect. It's like Cars and Trucks and Things That Go for things that fly.
B000V6738U|5.0|Loved Steely Dan for a long time. I think Aja was the last one I bought. Love them all, that pervert Cousin Dupree is a long time favorite.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app!! I have lost track of the number of times I have used it. I really love how easy it is to figure sales tax!!!!!!
B000V63AVY|4.0|I remember Super Tramp from the late 70's. It was a nice trip back in time and found some ones I had not heard before that I love.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay is amazing! It was a great book with so much emotion. Make sure you read the first 2 book's before! You must read Mockingjay.
0061339202|5.0|Thoroughly explained and a pleasure to read. Strong conceptual focus and meaningful understandings of the idea of flow as related to personal happiness and experience. Helpful for research and teaching methods.
B0037KMHRY|4.0|Man, I love this score! While Tron: Legacy wasn't as great a movie as you would hope story-wise, two things this movie gets 100% right are its visuals and, the reason you're reading this, the score! Daft Punk hits it out of the park with his musical score here. The only complaint I have about this product is that the first track you hear in the movie (the one that plays over the main titles) also contains some of the dialogue from the film over the music. I bought this CD mainly to hear this track in its entirety... WITHOUT anyone speaking over it! The good news is the rest of the score doesn't contain any unwanted voice over. But if you wish to hear that bad ass guitar riff you heard in the movie just as the title came up like I did, you'll have to whether through Jeff Bridges' words to hear it. I give the score a 5 out of 5, but the CD a 4. Great tracks, just wish I could have heard my favorite one dialogue free...
B003SPCYP8|4.0|Excellent movie and touching story line. This us a very good depiction if the hatred fueled by fear in our society
B004XISI4A|3.0|In my opinion there are a lot in the book which does not tell the story, so I feel the book drags on too many side kicks.
1416972250|5.0|I loved the first two books and third is equally as good! I couldnt put it down! i already ordered the next book and im so excited!
B001ILFUDC|1.0|The dvd I purchased does not work! I'm very disappointed because I was really looking forward to sharing it with my grandchildren. It was used so maybe the seller should've checked it out before selling it!
B00DDXJRJG|2.0|I've used this app for a few years now, across several devices.  It worked great on my older phones and tablet but after my newest phone received an upgrade to Lollipop recently, this app's EQ now only works sporadically.  I have to load/kill/load/kill it dozens of times and sometimes it'll start working and others it won't.  Hopefully the dev hasn't abandoned this because I like the ability to have custom presets.<br /><br />On my Motorola phone, increasing the boost on the EQ does lower the volume because the audio section of that device is crap, but on my HTC it works more like a conventional EQ.  Either way it works, just on some devices you may experience a reduction in overall volume if you use the EQ to boost certain bands excessively.i-band EQ with totally customizable center points and Q settings.  That would be awesome.<br /><br />But at least for casual users looking to eek out a little more oomph from their cheap earbuds (or bad car stereos, in my case) then the five selected bands are actually pretty good on their own.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Great condition & quick delivery! My grandchildren love this movie and I enjoy watching it with them too!<br />Can't wait to get them part 2!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|He could be a little more concise, it's true...but in some sense, it is the vast--and sometimes even mundane--detail of all the places and people in this literary world that is so utterly stunning.
B006VREOOY|5.0|Statham and Deneiro are fantastic! lots of action and a great storyline. easy to follow and fun to watch !
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This was my first streaming of a movie. It was great. Just like being at the movies. Amazon Prime is a hit.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I really like this app. I like that It gives me the weather when I need to know for the day.
B002MCJZHS|5.0|I am designer that usually works with headphones on and the XX album is great twist for the edm that i usually listen to.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Truly impressed by the talent and storyline. Learned the name of truly great artists. The only thing that would be more fantastic would be to see them in concert in person.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Brilliant game can't get enough of it. The pictures are really lovely and bright. Much better tan similar games I've played. Well worth downloading.
B005CRQ3IE|1.0|I ordered this e book through the direct link from Amazon to Pottermore. IT IS NOT A KINDLE COMPATIBLE FORMAT! Can you believe it? Worse yet - they do not give refunds!! They state this in their terms and conditions. Really? Who reads the fine print these days? DO NOT ORDER ANY KINDLE E BOOKS FROM POTTERMORE.<br />Very disapointing.
0920668372|5.0|Yes, no matter how tough you are, you will cry when you read this to your child.  I'll never forget the first time I read this to my child, I could not finish it.  My friend came over and I cried reading it to her and she cried too.  Husband didn't cry, not sure what his problem was but we're divorced now, oh well.  I gave this book to my daughter with all the other baby books (she has a few copies).  I bought a few more copies so she can give them to her MOM friends.  I hope they never take it off the book store shelves.  How many times will you have to read it until you don't cry anymore.  Huh, It gets me everytime!
B00190OHD6|4.0|My girlfriend suggested we get this movie and it turned out to be a really good flick. Its not your typical love story and offers a few interesting plot twist. The nonlinear presentation of the story line kept me interested and really allowed the plot unfolded as I watched. I also enjoyed seeing my \\"friend\\" lisa kudrow flex her acting muscles by playing a character other than Phoebe Buffay. As a man all I can say is \\"it was watchable & NOT the super sappy snooze fest I was initially expecting\\". Personally I would not buy/rent this or any other romance movie (if it wasnt for my gf) but she sits through my Action movies so I would gladly do the same for her.... bottom line its a chick flick, but its a watchable chick flick.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I pick this game up for a quick escape from my daily stresses. The first games are very easy allowing you to gradually build your skill. The outcomes are satisfying and achieved quickly enough so that there are not big time commitments. I have enjoyed this puzzle game.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This is not an action movie HOWEVER all of the action scenes are great! this movie is all about what a father is willing to do to save his daughter from international scum bags. Liam Neeson is a great actor and is perfect for this Revenge/vigilante role. Neeson plays a Retired international intelligence agent; who will do anything to save his daughter from international bad guys. The movie did a good job of getting its point across without getting too gruesome, sappy or preachy. Sure it's not the most realistic action movie ever made but it is Reality based and not completely unrealistic like most action movies. if you like Suspense, Action, or just want to watch a well scripted movie then Taken series is a good place to start.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I didn't think this could be better than the first one but it had so many twists and turns to make it fresh.<br />I loved how Kirk and Spock changed places from the original and loved that they brought back Khan!<br /><br />The actors and dialog make this movie. I especially enjoy watching it on my Kindle.<br />I really hope they continue this into a Star Trek III!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This movie was so intense from beginning to the end.  I cried maybe once or twice the first two times I saw it.  Even if you are not a Star Trek movie lover you will love this movie.  I recommend this movie to everyone. Hope there is a part 3!
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|While visually stunning, this film can't decide what it wants to be. Sometimes surreal, sometimes overly sentimental, it misses the mark with overblown music and crowd scenes, distracting from the underlying moral issues F. Scott Fitzgerald is raising. I'd recommend reading the book instead.
