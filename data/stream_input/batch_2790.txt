B005WUHAX8|5.0|Took me a few try's to put I on, but worked out great. Love the pink and gray color . Now I know my phone is protected. My son told me to go on Amazon and gave me a gift card to use. Three of my children and a couple of my grandchildren also have the LifeProof case, bu they paid more for theirs .
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I picked this up for free yesterday and have been playing ever since. Much like spades, it is a great game to kill time with.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't know why they require more words on reviews? So I am waisting your time reading this as I am my waisting time doing them a FAVOR!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read this book a while ago. Read it again. Was just talking about it at the table tonight. The book is better than the movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Okay,this calculator app is the best ever! I love it,and it is so easy to use! It is so well designed and it has helped me a lot(: The best part is that it's FREE!!!(: I enjoy it,it's worth having it,and over all awesome! So I hope that if you decide to get this wonderful app,that you will enjoy it too!
B003HV0TN2|5.0|Fast paced and well written had to read the second one straight after. Cant wait for the third book to come out, although it might be a while before that one comes out...
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I don't know why they require more words on reviews? So I am waisting your time reading this as I am my waisting time doing them a FAVOR!!!!
B004U8VWLE|3.0|I had heard that this was an interesting movie so I rented it on a whim last night. Still not sure what really was happening but I guess that was the point. I had heard this compared to the movie &#34;The Red Shoes&#34; but don't really see the connection, other than the obsession with ballet. Would I see it again? No. Would I recommend it to others? No. Do some people really like it? Yes. You might be the one that does.
B005VPRGB0|5.0|The 1st in class bricks toy. Outstanding quality, no compromise in fit and durability. The only next level is the motorized version
B00ADS98FC|4.0|PG-13 means 13 and up, right? Not too fond of the verbally expressed topics for a 13 year old, but the movie is great.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Love this show !  I enjoy all of the actors on the show!  Even though I know real crime investigation is different from what is on the show, the actors draw you into the show!
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|I watched this movie because I heard it was good even if you aren't a big fan of Katy Perry. It did not disappoint. What a story about trying and failing and trying again and believing in yourself. I like that the people around her were those that she knew before she was famous. It was sad to see her trying to salvage her marriage and exhausting herself in the process but being supported by those who loved her and wanted what was best for her. I enjoyed seeing her grandmother in the movie.
B001XVD21Y|5.0|Incredible characters, amazing plot, intense drama, Scorsese at his absolute best. Ensemble cast is fantastic. If you've never seen it, rent it tonight.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very fun and addictive. fun for all ages keeps you thinking and guessing just when you think you cant solve you figure it out.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I wanted this DVD to add to our collection.  I appreciate a picture with historical substance.  This picture is a keeper.
B00455IVHU|5.0|I am not a big Barbra Streisand fan, but I love this movie. It is so low key and showcases old-er actors who are believable. Not everyone is walking around with these beautiful bods and great jobs. They are normal people just looking for love.
B000VECAC6|5.0|I always loved the film, but the blu ray version has some great bonus features and is very high quality.  Must-have for any Python fan.
0553801473|4.0|I love this series!<br />But, good grief ! I sure hope George Martin doesn't make me wait 6 years for the next one!<br /> Can someone let him know that I am waiting to find out what happens in Westeros!<br />Unfortunatly, I read much faster than he writes :(
B005MLOKXA|4.0|A very dramatic show, very real law cases presented and very good acting. I highly recommend to watch it from season 1.
0786838655|5.0|this book was really good without giving to much away its about a 12 year old boy name percy jackson who gets kicked of every school he's been to for reasons that is later explain. His mother who basically raised him all by herself ( since his father isn't in the picture once again later explain and percy stepfather who is a jerk in every way you can imagin gives percy mom his car so they can spend the weekend togther in a cabin near a beach on there way things start to from bad to worse. like i said before  its very good book a first in five books and takes aspects of greek myths and puts them in mordern america( the setting being downtown new york) And a great buy
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Great scfi series that are imaginative, complex and interesting. The characters are believable, likable and react as i wish I could under the situation.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Saw the movie and decided I need to purchase it for my collection and I did. Watch it all the time. Am also a Civil War buff. Loved it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|My new favorite fantasy series. Mystery, drama, war, love, heartbreak, humor - something for everyone. You never truly know what's going to happen next.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Fun game makes you think. It gets hard as you get deeper in but I think anyone cane do it. Just good fun and good brain food.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|I really loved the story line, loved the special effects, and the general feel of the movie. Tom Cruise always delivers!
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Having heard some of T&S's earlier works, I was not expecting Heartthrob to be very good. But, they went well out of their usual music zone and created an excellent album.  I still think their earlier works aren't so good, but this album is a keeper!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|How do I get them off my kindle.  Need more room for other games.  I would appreciate any help you can give me.
0374533555|5.0|I really liked the case studies and stories that this book is filled with, has left me with a great sense of tapping into more of my potential as a human being. Really enjoyed this book and would certainly recommend it to others
B009CF3P7E|5.0|I have watched this several times and it never gets old. Just love, love, love everything about it: the special effects, the cast of characters, the story line. J. J. Abrams has stayed true to the Star Trek brand, in my opinion. The character of young Spock is totally amazing, love Chris Pine as Kirk, Scotty and Bones are fantastic. Highly recommended!
0345529057|5.0|Just what I expected. I'm excited to read these books! a fraction of the hard cover price! get it! fast shipping!
B0089LOG02|5.0|A friend said I should read this book and I am glad I did.  I very much enjoyed it, could not put it down.  The story line was so interesting, I had no idea about the orphan children and was very glad to be informed about their plight of life.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|I don't watch TV, but I do watch the intensive detailed oriented shows.  If you can't stand TV shows as watched by millions, give this show a try and you won't be disappointed.  95%  strengths and 5 % TV fluff(and even that small % is not quite fluff).  It's a combination I prefer to live with when watching in a &#34;show&#34;, instead of the opposite, &#34;TV for the masses&#34; idiocy.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Super costumes great story and characters what an interesting history piece too.  The drama can be a little much but it's engaging
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love this app. It has the best choice of sounds and is so ...well...relaxing. i like that you can combine the sounds and adjust the volume of each sound separately. Highly recommend. Only downside is the cost. $3 might be a tad high for what it is, but I got it as the free app of the day...so no complaints here :)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|amazing book. I recommend reading it! it really touched  my heart and actually made me cry tears of joy at the end
B00005JMCW|2.0|This product was misrepresented as being used once and like new. When it arrived, the DVD box was covered in a sticky dirty grime like it had been handled repeatedly by children with dirt and goo on their hands, The DVD itself was scratched and needed to be cleaned. I was extremely disappointed and felt ripped-off.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Never been into Zombie shows or movies but this series is by far the best! Started season 1 three weeks ago and couldn't stop watching. Most addictive show yet
B00634GHJA|4.0|Just barely easier than cables.  You have to mess around getting the tablet or phone recognized by the computer or input an IP address - almost easier to plug in the cable, but cool to send off your pics to other devices.  I am using it because of the cool factor but that may wear off.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It is a perfect app if I do say so very usefull for anybody to have or use.<br /><br />P.S. works very good on the kindle fire
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  It kept me flipping pages and moving onto the next book immediately after finishing this one!  Great characters and the author does not shy away from controversial and taboo topics.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|The Latin beat is different for the other work I have of Gardot, but her smooth stile is equally present in the CD.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Depends on if you want to read biographies and tech stuff, but it was interesting to me.  I recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is cool when u get a surf board because if you crash into something u still don't get caught...Its cool to get mystery boxes...Its cool to unlock characters<br />...
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It was an interesting book about the culture and politics in Afghanistan. he book left me with unanswered questions about some of the characters...
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I'm so glad I was introduced to this amazing saga! The vivid characters and detailed world won't allow me to set down my kindle. I'm glad there are many more in the series to feed my addiction!!
B00AYB0SQQ|5.0|The characters of the students were well-developed and their relationships within the group were engaging. The special effects were scary, but not overdone. This film has substance and I think anyone would have a good time watching it. I was left with the message &#34;Never judge a book by its cover&#34;, and that's all I'm going to tell you!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This book was astonishing. I've managed to comprehend many new assets by reading and acknowledging this book I very much appreciate the time that has been put into the making and process of this book.
030758836X|4.0|Before reading this book the most terrifying book I have read is In Cold Blood. This book just topped it. This book is more terrifying because its current generation and easily relatable. The book is about how a missing woman's case unfolds from a two person POV ( twist ).<br /><br />The book is enjoyable with many twists ( some downright weird ) and is definitely a page turner. But I would think twice before picking up another Gillian Flynn book. But that's just me.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I've been looking for a good horror movie for a LOOONG time and this definitively did it for me. The story is always better when others don't spoil it so I'll just say that it is good. It's not gonna blow your mind but it'll keep you engaged and interested in what's happening next. The direction was great too. I felt they did many different scenes that  brought out the scare in different ways. The acting was also top notch, I felt all characters were believable, something I feel horror movies usually have a problem with (why go into a pitch  darkbasement all by yourself when people have been missing?). I'm really surprised by how well the child actors did, they were creepy and cute when needed.<br /><br />Anyway, I really have nothing but praise for this movie. If there's one thing I could possibly point to, it is the fact that it did not blow my mind. That it wasn't an 11 out of 10 but hey, it's easily a 10 out of 10 in my book.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|I thought this was a great movie.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it took a while for the pace to pick up. A lot of dialogue in the first 45 minutes or so.  My wife lost interest before they even left the Shire, but once they set out on the journey to Lonely Mountain it gets much more exciting.  Love the world Peter Jackson has created and I would recommend to anyone who has a couple hours to burn
B008JDAC7G|4.0|This is a good game and it was free, but after awhile I get bored.  It doesn't hold my attention.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Ok,let me start by saying this isn't the type tv show I would have ever thought would be for me,but have had so many people telling me how good it is,thought I would give the first season a try.And now have all of the seasons available,and waiting on the new,and sadly last,season to start.This show is so well written,that I rate it among walking dead,and sons of anarchy,not for the young or squeamish however. The actors are all pros, not only the main characters,but the guests also. If you are a lover of great television,this will be a classic!
B00101ZOTA|5.0|Use this movie many times in quotes - it is the best acted, best plot twister that I've watched in many a day.  It's got a lot of rough in it, but the characters, in order to remain genuine, and they are that, have to be rough.  The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was making us believe he wasn't real...this one...is.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|This is the greatest album ever recorded.  Every song is a winner.  A must have for anyone who collects music.
0446547638|5.0|Another Nicholas Sparks book, that I could not put down!!!  It is probably one of my favorites books he has written!  A surprise ending!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game I play it every day it's very fun it's very addicting and plus its free so you should get it
B000QCS8TW|5.0|So good. Loved it!!!  It's been a really long time since I've enjoyed a fantasy book this much. READ IT!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love this game so much!! it so addicting. its something i'll be hooked on for a long while. im so glad i was shown this app
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We have enjoyed this game. It has provided many hours of entertainment for our entire family. We highly recommend this.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|Notice that the title is &#34;best-animated&#34;, not &#34;best animated.&#34; The plot isn't bad, but it's not what makes this movie great. Definitely a movie to buy on Bluray - the level of detail and effort put into every single frame is a spectacle to behold at higher resolutions only.
0345529057|5.0|I purchased these books for my father who is a fan of the show and he says the books help to fill in the gaps the series has left out.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|She writes as well as she acts...very funny,  I highly recommend it to any one who enjoys good humor and a great introduction to Tina if you do not know her work
B00AEFY552|5.0|Favorite all time movie, really no doubt about it. Has a lot of extras and you cannot go wrong with this movie.
B00AHE2Q8I|5.0|This is one of Linda Howard's best books, I have read it about 5 times and it never fails to get a few laughs from me, I would recommend this book to anyone who reads  Linda Howard
086571701X|5.0|I have never enjoyed the hard work of digging in the dirt to garden.  Pulling weeds, fighting pests and having to deal with dry weather was always a pain. Then I heard of the fun of aquaponic gardening and that has changed everything. Bernstein in her book has laid out a detailed plan for the beginner to start from scratch and build their own system. All you need is water, fish, plants and bacteria that is in nature and some tanks and you can farm Aquaponically.  I have used her excellent insights to build my own small pilot plant. Every detail has been covered and it has become my Aquaponics Bible. This book covers everything you need to begin and continue being a success as a gardener.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|It is really fun at first, but then it gets sort of boring. Great time killer though. Overall, I recommend it
B003Y74AZ2|4.0|I recently purchased my first Iphone.  As the name implies &#34;AmazonBasics&#34;, this case is simple and does the job, protects the phone.  It has a good feel to it and does not block the cell signal.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|This was a good movie. Could have been better but there's always room for improvement. Radcliffe and Watson make the movie in my opinion.
B000002UZ4|5.0|This was a replacement item as Someone stole my original.  As usual it is a great CD as I ordered it twice.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Unlike anything I have ever read. Amazing story. Amazing woman. Would recommend to anyone looking for inspiration and encouragement and a great read!
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|I don't purchase a lot of music (mostly a radio guy I guess), but after hearing excerpts from 'Bakersfield' on NPR, I downloaded it almost immediately.<br /><br />This album has a great sound that I have not heard in way too long. My father used to play a lot of Buck Owens when I was a kid. Vince Gill's voice and Paul Franklin's steel guitar have done an amazing job of bringing the twang of old school country into the 21st century.<br /><br />Those of you who grew up listening to country music know how it can stick with you for the rest of your life.  The saddest of lyrics somehow bring you comfort as they ride the notes from the band. This album brings nostalgia without feeling old.  I'd recommend it to anyone who thinks about their parent's record collection and how the turntable use to help fill their childhood house with a feeling of simple comfort and home.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so fluffy - I'm going to die!  No seriously...Minion Rush is fun. The animation is great and the little extras make it addictive.
B00919CI5Q|1.0|Under-performed. Frame-rate drops instead of gains, and it is also unstable. My 3 yrs-old graphic card gtx 460 gives more fps than this card does. I'm guessing because it only has 1 power connector so it doesn't receive much power. For such a big graphic card that's a bad design. Ridiculous. Totally unacceptable.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game! It's fun and a great time waster!! Plus it's free! I totally recommend it! Hope u like it!!
1401938906|2.0|I have been hearing a lot about &#34;The Law of Attraction&#34;.  This book boasted using the scientific method to prove its existence.<br /><br />The problem with this book is that the scientific experiments can neither be verified or denied.  The results are completely up to the interpretation of the reader and thus can not actually be considered scientific.<br /><br />I tried to remain open minded but by experiment #4 I was completely turned off.  If your results come up negative anyone can say you simply did not believe enough.  That is not scientific, it is pseudo-religious.<br /><br />This lady tried to suggest there are people who can produce gems just by wishing for them. For the most part I have felt the law of Attraction is relatively harmless.  It takes a strong desire to achieve what you want.  It is not some magical force that turns your thoughts into reality, it is you!!! When you set your mind to a thing you then find a way to achieve it.  Your awareness of the tools that can make your goals achievable is heightened and you put those tools to work.<br /><br />Most people I find that subscribe to the Law of Attraction are people that want something for nothing.  It doesn't work that way,
B008476HBM|5.0|Loved this book. Once again I'm going to miss these characters! I love this novel because it had romance of a different time period. I can't wait to read another Jane Austen book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is truly a Great Series and another bonifide winner from PBS.<br />Castles and cool old cars for a backdrop.
B005DD7H50|4.0|Had some time so I saw this on my laptop and found it entertaining and loved the ending . Thought he would never kick the habit !!!<br />But he Did ...
B006GWO5NE|1.0|A review of this product is difficult because the port seems to be the problem, therefore  the new cable and charger does not work as it should.  I appreciate Amazon Kindle replacing the charger and cable.<br /><br />I really thought the Kindle Fire would be functional forever, as I was not the type to read e - books.  That is the reason I gave in to e-reading cost of books excellent and ease of obtaining reading material, again never did I think this could happen.<br /><br />During my conversation with Kindle Cutomer Service to obtain a new cable and charger, I was informed , if the cable and charger does not fix the problem, we will upgrade the device (if you want) to a Kindle HD for 160.00............I'm old, UPGRADE?  I guess the 199.00 price tag for the Kindle Fire was the price for only a year and a half of reading!  So my sister has an IPAD no issues, no problems, nothing to even remark about.<br />Yes the IPAD costs much more, but maybe I would have spent more if Kindle advised,  the Kindle Fire port is very weak ,  only works for a limited time.<br /><br />And as an old lady I just sat in my chair at night and read and browsed, no abuse, no travel, nothing!<br /><br />Oh Well guess it's time for an Ipad.  I don't want an upgrade or a new device as the quality must be only fair to poor.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Easy to read and view pictures friends put on face book. Also I can take my Kindle with me and share picture with family and friends.
B0098460O4|5.0|I saw the video of \\"Jonathon and Charlotte\\" on BGT.  I was so impressed by their talent, and you would not believe the two are as young as they are.  I was so excited about this CD coming out, and am looking forward to more of their music.  I listen to it over and over, and it is just so beautiful.  You will not be sorry for purchasing this CD.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This was a deeply personal movie for me since recovery is part of my life ... for those who do not have anyone living in this deeply sad and selfish world , this is a glimpse  of the struggle one undergoes and what some can do to help or enable the addict / alcoholic ..... and the mystical way he flew that plane was never taught to him ,,,, that was a miracle and nothing short of it  !!!!
B0030SZ2D4|4.0|One of Vin Diesel's earliest movies. Low budget but still entertaining. About as &#34;anti&#34; as an anti hero can get.
0439813786|5.0|Drawings leap off the page in the printed version of `The Invention of Hugo Cabret' complimenting Brian Selznick's much beloved story, circa 1930 Paris.<br /><br />Jeff Woodman does for the audio narration of `Hugo' as Martin Scorsese does for the film.<br /><br />Read, listen, and watch the story of Selznick's timeless masterpiece experiencing the complete trinity of a spell-binding mystery.
1781162646|5.0|What an unusual book for Stephen King to write!  It only solidifies his reputation as a consummate writer.  A very pleasant read with a young man's coming of age that didn't include any evil monsters.  I have always loved writings by Stephen King but this one was a real departure for him.
1451695195|5.0|This book brought home the fact that we have free will here on earth .... but when we leave here we are welcomed by the higher beings who will love us in spite of ourselves .
B006DZYM0A|2.0|this movie is a complex waist of time, it starts with a horrific accident but the rest of the movie its a mess its not here or there
B00957T6X6|4.0|I love Tyrion to bits! Not as well written as LOtR but just as unputdownable. No read for people with a weak stomach though.
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|The movie is great if you're like me who's given up on horrors having to make sense as far as following some kind of rule or sense of logic and staying within those parameters throughout.<br /><br />When I watch a horror film, I simply leave all manner of reasoning and rational thinking at the door and watch for entertainment only.  With this said, I pretty much enjoyed the film.  It was a bit far-fetched but I just overlooked it.<br /><br />I really appreciate that it did not contain any inappropriate scenes/sexual content and the language was clean.  Hence, I rate it a 3.5.  Wait.<br /><br />What?<br /><br />Oh you don't give 1/2 marks?<br /><br />Okay.  Fine Then.  4.<br /><br />:-)<br /><br />The movie succeeded in scaring my poor husband to death but failed to have the same affect on me.  It's just that I see through Hollywood's lies.  These ghost/demon films basically depict the demons/entities as immensely powerful and dangerous forces that we are powerless to stop and the only ones that can save us is the Catholic system.  Okay....<br />Like really?<br /><br />And people buy into this hype.  I am a believer and I read my Bible so I see past the lies and I'm able to watch these movies and just chuckle.  I've had personal experiences with familiar spirits and demons and yes, it's scary, but Christ did a finished work on the cross and I have power to trample on every serpent and scorpion without being harmed.<br /><br />But back to the review....Hope you enjoy the movie if you decide to buy it.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|I love Pierce Brosnan in anything. This is a great movie. Rene Russo is excellent! I also watched the 1968 version with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. This version is so much better and enjoyable!
B002UJIY7A|5.0|this movie keeps you guessing the whole movie whos the killer, its got amazing scenery for any thriller fan its a must see
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|Fantastic vocals, intriguing drama, hubba hubba romance, who could ask for more?  Okay, some parts of the story lines needed help in season one but those issues were totally forgivable and easily eclipsed by the shows drama, development and music.  Take the the time and enjoy this guilty pleasure.  I sure did.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|This set is amazing. Even the selection screen in wonderful. I have always loved this series, but it is so much better when I watch them in order.
B0056JJ1M8|5.0|Sam Jackson is superb! Based on a true story, the writing, directing and acting is outstanding. It held my interest throughout!
B0057F869U|3.0|I was disappointed in how they ended the movie. Once Jane left Rochester, a lot of the story was skipped over.
B009XEE0DW|5.0|Must have for all Mylene's fans. She still can surprise me. I love this album. Some of the tracks are just exceptional.
B007RE0SCW|5.0|My daughter loves this doll and plays with it on a daily basis. I'm glad that I got this for her.
B003M70O5O|5.0|The season was great. The ending was unexpected and makes you want more. Can't wait for season three. I am sure that I will watch it again.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Love all the twists and turns in this sequel. Very excited for the movie to come out, I hope it does the book justice.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|As always - great CD by one of the best! A couple of visitors sit in on a few sets - Beth Hart is worth the price of the CD!
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|Acting outstanding, funny, moving, gruesome, the script writer play with words and it is hilarious.  If you liked the book, you will love the movie.
B003U51EE8|5.0|I'm still enjoying the great acting and the many twists and turns in the plot. I still don't know who to like or dislike.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|It will change how you feel about yourself and how you interact with others. Make it a priority to read it this month.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|If you read my original review of THE TERMINATOR on blu-ray, you remember that I made one thing clear. The 5-Star Review of the film was for the movie, NOT the blu-ray version. I complained that the picture and sound quality of that blu-ray edition were no better than my DVD Special Edition. I focused my review on the movie, itself and stated that the film was in need for a SERIOUS remastering job.<br /><br />I know I'm not the only one who complained of that Blu-Ray edition, and those complaints have been answered!!! This new edition on Blu-Ray is a MAJOR improvement, both in picture and sound. It looks so much better now. And the new DTS 5.1 sound is an even bigger improvement.<br /><br />If you haven't read my original review of THE TERMINATOR on Blu-Ray and want to know why I loved that movie so much, it's still here on Amazon.com. Just look up all the reviews that I have written.<br /><br />I wouldn't be too surprised if in 2014 a 30th Anniversary Edition is released. If they do, I have a wish-list of bonuses on blu-ray: A new commentary by James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a 30th Anniversary reunion of the cast and crew, and a tribute to Stan Winston, who did truly amazing work on the film.
B00COHGQ28|5.0|Elwood: It's a hundred and six miles to Chicago, we've got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark, and we're  wearing sunglasses.<br /><br />Jake: Hit it.<br /><br />I've always been a fan of The Blues Brothers movie (and band too for that matter) this Universal July 9, 2013 best of Decades 1980's edition is easily the best I've seen  the film look and sound. The scene early in the film where Dan and John are standing in front of the stained glass window in the church is outstanding to see here. The music is clear and sounds great. So much memorable dialog, gags, and of course musical numbers. More than a classic comedy, this is a classic film, John Belushi was truly a force to be reckoned with during this period and it shows here. If you're wondering if Blu-Ray is worth the upgrade from DVD, absolutely.

B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Seemed to be written in a similar vein as Harry Potter and other books based on fantasy.  Could have been better.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Real fun, challenging, starts easy then gets hard, just think they should have hints available if you need it and some more levels
1401938906|5.0|This book catches the reader's attention right from the start. Pam has a way of adding humor to a most quantum and spiritual subject that is enlightening and entertaining! Hands on experiments add to the fun, and they work! A must have for anyone practicing the law of attraction and abundance!
1936608898|5.0|This is the best book on nutrition that I have ever read! And I have read a lot of them! The authors tell you how and why different foods affect your body and your health. Easy to read and to understand. A bit of humor, too! I love this book and will keep it for a ready resource. I have applied their suggestions and I feel so much better! All my sugar cravings left quickly and I find myself only wanting to eat healthy fruits and vegetables, as well as a variety of meats.  I am losing inches, too! Especially in my middle where it is so hard to lose. I am 71 years old and feel great!  Thank you! Thank you!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Although I was not born until some time later, I understand it is an accurate description of the caste system and the changes brought about by World War I.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I hesitated going to the movies to see this film.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful acting, and story line.  It wasn't what I expected but I loved it.  Bradly Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence we're excellent.  It's a must see.
B00AO686MY|5.0|If you don't know, you should. This a great family film with lots of great jokes and a fun performance by Bob Hoskins.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This is a really fun alphabet app that my kids really enjoy and I'm glad I bought this app for my kids.  My kids are learning the ABC's easily with this app and I could not have been more pleased by such a great learning app than this one.  If you want to teach you're kids the ABC's then this is the app to buy, hands down.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|It's Merle and Buck's music performed by Vince Gill with stellar back up from the Time Jumpers, Paul Franklin.<br /><br />The ten tracks (could have included more IMO) are:<br />1.) Foolin' Around (Buck -- Harlan Howard co-author)<br />2.) Branded Man (HAG)<br />3.) Together Again (Buck)<br />4.) The Bottle Let Me Down (One of my all time favorite Hag tunes)<br />5.) He Don't Deserve You Anymore (Buck, song written by Arty Lange)<br />6.) I Can't Be Myself (HAG)<br />7.) Nobody Fool But Yours (Buck)<br />8.) Holding Things Together (HAG)<br />9.) But I Do (a Tommy Collins tune)<br />10.) The Fightin' Side of Me (HAG).<br /><br />If you like the Time Jumpers CDs with Vince Gill, you'll enjoy this CD and appreciate the guitar licks.<br />Have to give Vince Gill and Paul Franklin credit -- what they've done here is a Tribute type album with stellar musicians in the band and it's very good.........but how do you improve upon Merle Haggard's long-time band, The Strangers, who were at their peak back when these tunes were recorded as Haggard standards (I have often contended that Hag's band back during the late 70's and into the 80's when guys like Eldon Shamblin and Tiny Moore from Bob Wills' Texas Playboys joined the Strangers - may have been the best country band of all time)........and then you've got the Buckaroos back before Don Rich left us all too soon -- that's a pretty high bar.<br /><br />This CD just came out and will likely become a discount bargain soon. Because it's only 10 tracks, wait for the discount and you'll be getting a gem.
0345803507|5.0|I loved this book, I couldn't put it down.  I only wish there was a 4th book! I recommend reading the trilogy.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Fun but after awhile it gets very repetitive great time killer though , funny at times great for kids do buy it
B004HD61KE|4.0|I am glad I read Black Order first so I knew a few of the people in the book, really makes a person think about could it or not be the way it all started.
1250029465|3.0|The author can write okay..and I applaud him for his perseverance and strength.. I love cats. They are and always have been my favorite animals. Maybe because my grandma always had them and I associate them with her. Anyhow, I have a couple of complaints about the book. First off, I feel that the author left an awful lot about himself out.. a little snippet here and there, but I don't feel I got to truly know him. Secondly, the story just kind of winds and meanders here and there.. it's pretty anticlimatic.... But wishing him and Bob the best of all things.
B00BWL99L2|5.0|There's more great music on this album than you an poke a stick at :)  I hope that they re-release the &#34;We will take you with us&#34; as the live versions are even better!
B00A3ZJIY6|5.0|I believe this movie made Leonardo DiCaprio famous. It was very well done. This movie showed lots of action and romance.--The Titanic was a great ship!--This movie also compared the rich to the poor.--I would highly recommend this to anyone.<br />D.E.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|Not rocket science, but a decent story, with capable actors, and some of the plot twists were well done -worth it.
B000HF6XV8|2.0|This is one of my favorite childhood books, but this movie changes too many things to make it enjoyable for fans of the real book. Changed the parents deaths, totally missed the personality of Mary, Mrs. Medlock was a completely different character based on Maggie Smith not the book's character which was much kinder and not a bully, the finding of the key, I don't think the sisters were twins, the kids were never kept apart~ why invent that whole stupid drama when the book is wonderful all on its own, the whole house was supportive of the kids, the magic mumbo jumbo did not happen like that~ the message of the book is about positive thinking, that was Colin's 'magic' , and why change the ending?!! The real ending is much better~ I feel they let Maggie Smith run away with this movie, Medlock wasn't that big of a character, Martha had more parts in the book.<br />If you're not a fan of the book, this movie is good on its own, but otherwise avoid it as it will just annoy you.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Stevie Wonder at his absolute best!!  SIR DUKE, I WISH, KNOCKS ME OFF MY FEET, AS, BLACK MAN,  PASTTIME PARADISE, VILLAGE GHETTO LAND... This mix of love songs, party grooves and socially conscience jams is unmatched.<br />I've said this for 5... count 'em FIVE decades and the album still holds up.<br />GREATEST ALBUM EVER RECORDED!!!
B00CNB2ZBQ|5.0|All of the Merlin series are excellent.--The knights are always giving their all to protect King Arthur and they even watch over Merlin.--As I have mentioned before, these series are action packed--Evil is conquered by good!--I highly recommend all of the Merlin series.--All the actors and actresses have done an excellent job!<br />D.E.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|The movie takes place in Russia.  Bruce Willis' character is again challenging the world - this time with his son.

B004HWYTP4|5.0|i liked the movie alot but i could barely hear the actors speaking the music was so<br />insanely loud...please fix the sound... red imho was better than red 2
B009LHWEKW|5.0|Supernatural is full of action! There is always the unexpected!--It is about a family that fights against the devil and his demonic followers.--I don't believe angels act the way they are portrayed in these series, but the fantacy is good coming against evil.--I recommend this series.<br />D.E.
B005DC68NI|5.0|As a new author who self published this book was an amazing find! It was referred to me by another author when I was stuck on what to do in regards to self publishing. This book did the trick. It was easy to read for a newcomer and very informative! I recommend this book to ANYONE considering self publishing!
0385349831|5.0|I am very fond of Author Paulo Coelho, I read The Alchemist and it was one of my favorites. I will now add this book to the list.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded this for my 4 yr old grand-daughter & she loves it (mostly because she loves the minions. It is a fairly simple game, but may not be suitable for all 4 yr olds,
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book was not what I expected, but the short stories did all come together.  I still want to see the movie :)
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I don't have much experience with mp3 apps but this seems good.  Quick syncing and downloading. Sound is really nice. It made me really happy the day I got it with the Free Zip music from CD purchases off Amazon.com.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Action packed and fast-moving. Not for kids. Engrossing and surprising. Can't wait for the next season as I've watched them all and more than once.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Just found it hard to sympathize with the characters.  Almost stopped reading halfway through, but then the story<br />seemed to pick up and I did finish it.  I have friends who have read and liked it and friends who have read it and<br />didn't like it.
B00B3EJ292|1.0|I did not watch this. Did not understand the language so I really should not rate it at all. Sorry
B005544V6A|4.0|I'm only halfway through season one but so far I love this show! I think the interplay between the characters is entertaining. I watch this on Amazon Prime at work if I don't leave for lunch. The show holds my attention and gets my mind off work for an hour.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|Love it, love it love it, Did I say I love it. My son got me hooked on this and I really do enjoy it, especially when waiting at Hardware/tool stores for hubby.
044024613X|5.0|I really like this legal thriller. And thriller it was. I had no idea how it would end until it actually ended. A well known and liked District Attorney is forced to defend his son in the murder of a fellow student of his son. Through the well examined and lengthy trial of Jacob, the DA son, it is never really clear if Jacob is guilty or who actually killed the other student.<br /><br />That trial has a bizarre ending. After month of trying to get their lives back to some semblance of normal, Jacob and his parents take a trip to a tropical resort. Again another person who Jacob just befriended dies and the family is back in court,exactly where they were a year ago.<br /><br />There is a new genetic twist to this story which I will leave to,the readers to discover and also the bizarre ending to this great book. I hope the author writes another zinger of a novel.
034580404X|5.0|.  After hearing so much about it, decided to purchase and read the books.  Most interesting  and spell bound.  Once you got started you almost couldn't put it down.  Wanted to continue to read.  Most enjoyable I must say.  Have recommended the books to numerous friends.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|I really enjoyed the show. This is the second time I bought the complete series the first time several discs were scratched and skipped a ton. The second time one disc was a little scratched and it skipped a bit. I would suggest watching quickly so you have time to return it if need be.
B001D09OAI|5.0|If you love baseball, then you'll love this parody. The acting is good. If your favorite baseball is losing, this might help put things into perspective. A must own if you are a fan of the &#34;Tribe.&#34; ML2 is good too. There is a 3 & 4 that I haven't seen as yet.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a great game for all ages! It is a must get on the kindle and or droid devices.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Booty quest is a fun game to play need more levels keep up the good work can't wait to see what you come up with next
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As I said for the first season, this is really well-acted period drama by a great ensemble cast.  I love Maggie Smith in this series.
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|When I first listened to it, I was a bit surprised - felt a bit heavier than previous albums. But quickly I started to appreciate the overall feeling of this album, and listened to it many, many times already.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I have played this through many times and have thoroughly enjoyed it.  However, the replay value goes way down since it is a crippled version of the original.  The Google Play store has released an updated version that has all the mini games, achievements, and the ever soothing zen garden.  I just uninstalled the Amazon version and dropped .99 cents at the Google Play store so I can have the full PC experience.  Until Amazon updates this version (if they ever do), then don't waste your time.  Shame on you, Amazon.
B0073PPNE8|5.0|This movie portrays the physical struggles one had to endure to stay alive and the emotional upheaval of the relationships among neighbors, lovers, friends and foes .
B008HJGPVO|2.0|I don't think this works as I expected it would.  I've never used one before, never had a \\"touch screen\\" device before, so I don't really know what I expected.  This product is exactly as described so if a person knows more about this type of thing than I do, they would probably be better able to rate it than I am.<br /><br />I've had this stylus for a while now and I'm not that happy with it.<br />Problems:<br />1. Cap was never tight to begin with but loosened over time.  I have lost the cap several times because it just pops off.<br />2. The multi tip feature seems like a good idea, but in use the tips became worn quickly.  One I can no longer use at all because it is down the metal holding it in.  Since I bought this to help protect the touch screen, rubbing metal across the screen doesn't seem like a good idea.<br /><br />I would not buy this again and am now looking for something to replace it with.<br /><br />Not really worth the money but live and learn, eh?
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Nice story with good actors. Heart warming story.........<br />But bit far from reality.  They are all so wealth with good health care....so they can stay in nice life
B004NDVJA0|5.0|My daughter gave me this cd for Christmas and I never heard of Agnes Obel before, but this is one of my favorite cds. I have a 8 month old grandaughter and she does not want to take a nap. We found if we play Agnes Obel within 5 minutes she will be sleep, its a miracle!
B0094M4NBW|4.0|I really liked the book - probably why I like the movie as well. Viggo does a good job in the movie - it parallels the book pretty well. I thought the punch at the end of the book was much stronger than at the end of the movie. Still..a good movie and ending.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|So far, I like the game.  It isn't as easy as it might seem so you really have to think.  Some things have to be found in a particular order and that can throw you off a bit at first.  Sometimes you have to try something a couple of times before it works, however, I don't know if that is a bug or user error, lol.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Liked the series, now on to Season 2.  The show is predictable but intriguing.  No Lol  moments but I do not think they were going for that.  Overall its good.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works great. Same as kindle fire. Easy to use and nice interface. No problems with it yet but I haVe only used it a few times.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|This is a wonderful Thriller that will keep you entertained throughout your viewing. Tom cruise<br />does a great job as the focal point of this film and all should enjoy same.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game. Very addicting. I would like to see more levels.<br />Overall this is a great game well done.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|About time that Danny Trejo got a leading role in a film like this! Steven Seagal also stars in this movie, along with Michelle Rodriguez, both of whom I like as well! I did think the ending could have been better, but still does not diminish the overall effect of the film!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is fast, and not as easy as it looked.  But I enjoyed it. Great fun in a cool game.
6305511055|5.0|This is a great Thriller/Spy Movies that has many of the great Actors of the 50's, 60's and 70's in it. The Plot is excellent and I would recommend this to all.
B009G41CG2|3.0|It's an okay Mahjong puzzle. I didn't care for the tile design because the tiles all blend<br />together making it a big strain on your eyes.
B000SEIDR0|3.0|An in depth look at where our food comes from, how current agricultural production is harming the environment and our health.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I downloaded this game to keep my sister busy but I play it as much as her I think. I have had it freeze a few times though
B007NVJ7NU|5.0|This is a mind-expanding film in earnest.  A lot of movies make attempts to explore and expand human consciousness.  Enter the Void is one of the rare films that actually succeeds.
B00881VLCE|3.0|It's like a traditional jigsaw puzzle with the option of selecting the amount of puzzle pieces.<br />It's very difficlt to work with the pieces if you choose more than 20 to 30 pieces.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|I bought this movie for my sister in law. I have seen it a couple of times. Really excellent. Great music.
B009MFKO3M|2.0|I don't understand why people got so excited about this album. Yes, the lead singer sounds a little like John Lennon. But that doesn't make up for the lazy lyrics and copycat retro pop-psychedelic sound. I would pass on this album.
1476712042|5.0|I was recomended this book by a co-worker, I fell in love with this book from the first moment that Abby and Travis met! I started reading it at 9pm Thursday night and sat up till 3:30am reading it! I literally had to leave it in my living room so I could go to bed and finished it the next night after I got home from work.<br /><br />Their relationship reminds me of my first serious relationship and it brought so many memories of that time that and I found myself crying while I was reading the book. I haven't found a book in a long time that's brought so many emotions out of me like this book did.  I can't wait to start reading the next book in this series!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am not a gamer but I do like minion rush.  I love the facial expressions on the minions and the other humorous things in this game.  There is a good variety of courses to run through.  A nice variety of skill levels for new and experienced players.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is so awesome it does take a couple runs to get used to everything but after that it's awesome. It isn't like temple run were you see the same thing over and over again it's something new every time.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|His music never seems to get old and i have listened to the CD many times since the purchase last month
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|A hold your breath movie until at last the family is reunited under almost impossible but fortunate circumstances.<br /><br />Very well acted by the entire cast.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Could use a 'demo' for when you first start to play the game just to show you what to do
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Awesome and fun! I really enjoy this game! It's challenging and fun at the same time. I would really recommend it!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I am quite enjoying this game,Graphics are great and its very addictive,though It seems quite expensive,I am unsure if I like it that much that I want to part with that much cash for a game.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I JUST GOT A KINDLE FIRE HD.  I WAS VIEWING YOUTUBE VIDEO THRU THE WEB JUST FINE.  I DECIDED TO DOWNLOAD THIS APP.  WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP.  I DOWNLOADED IT AND NOW \\"CANNOT\\" VIEW ANY YOUTUBE VIDEOS.  AND WHEN I TRY TO GO BACK TO THE WEB TO VIEW THEM, IT NOW TELLS ME THAT I HAVE TO DOWNLOAD ADOBE.  HOPEFULLY I CAN RESTORE TO FACTORY DEFAULTS.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an amazing and very nice game, liitle children can play it easily. I have one son of  5 years and he love it
B0042EJD8A|3.0|Compelled us to talk about it at work.  We purchased it to become more aware of the fracking issues in the midwest.
B003WWZ1R0|5.0|I love any putumayo cd's and this one is no exception. Soothing music. Wonderful collection and great sound. Thank you.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Feedly is a great replacement for Google Reader. I'm pleased with the App and would suggest it to others. I was familiar with it prior to downloading it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really good book<br />I will read it again sometime in the future I like the ending and the whole series was great
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I love how this one is different from the rest. The constant change in scenery keeps you alert and interested. Great fun
B000GCFG7E|5.0|was very good, I enjoy reading  it very much.<br />If you like to read this type of books, you will enjoy the whole series.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My daughter introduced me to this game which I initially thought to be way too easy. Quickly the levels got more challenging.  This is relaxing because I can do it at my pace and can go back and make needed changes to solve.  If you have ever played the &quot;Rush Hour&quot; car puzzles I think you will enjoy this.
B00192IV0O|5.0|I purchased a used cd of the Black Eyed Peas and was pleasantly surprised to find it just like new. Every song played perfectly and even the cover was untouched!
030758836X|1.0|This book is a rote action. There is nothing intellectually stimulating, imaginative, or surprising contained in the meta-plot or actions of the characters therein.<br /><br />Many negative reviewers are taking issue with the deviation of character behavior from real human societal and instinctual norms. This is not my issue. When reading fiction, I begin with a plausible suspension of disbelief. If characters behave outside of normal, that's fine. Fictional universes have fictional rules. Granted, the characters in this particular work are supposed to exist in a \\"normal\\" (i.e.- homogenized with our own mean correlation of reality) paradigm, but excessive normality in fiction makes for boring stories, so I was hoping for sharp deviation in such a popular work. I wanted to like it, but it is simply bad fiction.<br /><br />The premise was attractive. A murder mystery under the premise of a dissolving marriage is a pretty standard vehicle. Agamemnon, anyone? However, the added angle of two characters narrating their purportedly inevitable conflict through two separate time streams hooked me. Seems like an interesting thematic engine upon cursory inspection. Shakespearean, perhaps.<br /><br />The love affair was over quickly.<br /><br />Predictability and Pandering:<br /><br />As a psychologist, I kept trying to constrain the behavior of the characters to established scientific norms of human action causality paradigms (including psychological pathologies), but quickly found this model to be inefficient. Then it dawned on me. I should try to establish the author's intent and predict the behavior of the characters based on the ensuing causality cascading effect. Therein was the rub.<br /><br />\\"If I was an author trying to wring maximum shock value out of a meandering and stilted plot, all the while attempting to confound readers by drawing correlations beyond logical validity, what would I do?\\"<br /><br />Once I applied this formula, I was able to predict every subsequent action of the characters long before it was revealed by the writing. Being this ridiculously predictable kills a plot for me. If I know the characters as well as the author by page 30, the excitement is dead. This can be reversed by credible (in the context of the fictional paradigm) change in the context of causality, which, of course, never happens. By the end, I simply didn't care enough to have an emotional reaction one way or the other. Growth (for good or bad... or whatever) makes good characters. Twists used for over-wrought dramatic framing makes rote caricatures. This book sadly employs the latter.<br /><br />Clunky Application of Framing Theme:<br /><br />As Burgess stated, \\"A good novelist should not preach, as sermonizing has no place in good fiction.\\" The ham-fisted structuring around themes of \\"biased media\\" and \\"economic troubles\\" was too creakily implemented. If done in a more nuanced and muted style, it could have added to the narrative. As is, it came off not as a backdrop, but as another poorly-written addition to a menagerie of two-dimensional antagonists. A good analogue would be a character stepping on stage to crudely shout his name at the other actors, only to exit and never contribute to the plot. Again, it's simply bad writing.<br /><br />Incoherence:<br /><br />If you let go of a ball while holding out your arm, it falls. This is a pretty standard logical correlation. In fiction, you can suspend or alter this through establishing exposition as to why it isn't so (surreptitiously if done well). This exposition is never done, or hinted at, but the suspension of logical causality is continuously employed. This comes off as an excuse as to why none of the characters in this novel grow, change, or simply alter in rational conformance to narrative pressure. The characters don't \\"grow\\", they simply throw out rote and predictable \\"twists\\". These twists are never foreshadowed in a manner that causes the reader to think. It's simply an engine toinject dramatic ridiculousness without the pesky details of narrative structure or thematic credulity. It played off like a cheap soap opera. If one puts pressure on the surface, one will quickly find that the empress has no clothes.<br /><br />Pandering:<br /><br />The unifying theme is that the author seems to be desperately grasping at what she thinks will shock her readership. Looking at the book through this lens imparts almost complete comprehension without even opening it. It's like a Mad Lib, where one simply has to paste the character names and scene locations. This may be a universal failing of the genre, but it's a monumental failing of this work. It's an endless cavalcade of tropes applied to a banal narrative. Lack of plausible causality coherence is occasionally lampshaded, but the author, for the most part, simply tries to cover it up with the aforementioned \\"twists\\".<br /><br />To summarize, this work projects like an insubstantial papier-mâch&eacute; veneer trying to pass itself off as a legitimate, engrossing story. In this endeavor, it fails horribly. One cannot build a tower on a faulty foundation, and this Tower really leans. The unifying characteristic of sociopaths is a weak to non-existent sense of self, and an inability to find value in anything beyond external appraisal and validation.<br /><br />In this fashion, the characters aren't sociopaths, the narrative is.inject dramatic ridiculousness without the pesky details of narrative structure or thematic credulity.

B0087JTAKW|5.0|Best book ever<br /> I enjoyed every second of reading this novel it kept me intrigued every single second reading it
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Like the game, but keep forgetting what the wild tiles do. Nice graphics and the different puzzles keep you on your toes.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great for getting books on demand  when you want to read something. Very convenient if you never have time to go to a book store
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read many romance/adult novels and this has been one of my favorites that has lead to many other books similar. Love her writing! Can't wait to see what Colleen Hoover comes up with next!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Loved the book.  5 stars. Not overly medical. Highly recommended for those questioning their faith. What an amazing and faithful family.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|This is a very suspenseful movie. It has a lot of twist and turns.  It is worth it to watch again and again.
B00CCXL9OE|5.0|The picture and sound were incredible.  Highly recommend this to anyone who wants to enhance their viewing experience of Aladdin.
B0085CXVOC|4.0|I liked the movie. Lots of action and funny in parts.  Penélope Cruz, Matthew McConaughey were great in Sahara and it was well worth watching.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|I was pleased that  the movie followed the books. The  graphics and visual effects were great and added to the movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read Part 1 as a free short-story download, and knew I had to buy the whole dang thing.  I think the fact that it was written as a novella/short story collection makes it better than if the author was sitting down to write one novel.  It forces the story to move and flow with so much detail and storyline that you feel satisfied over and over throughout the book.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|Excellent action move really enjoyed it, missed it when it was doing the movie theater rounds but this way I have my own copy and can watch it anytime. DVD arrived as promised and not damaged.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|The initial Price was a bit high but I got it on a great deal, and it worth it. I know the era of the era of movie streaming but you have to have some movies and music.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I usually start these kinds of puzzler games and get bored at some point and never complete it.  This one is exceptional. I completed it.  Granted number of levels was relatively small but the game and level design are of high quality and immense enjoyability. As the top reviewer described, you figure out how to reconstruct the pattern on the ball given the example shown on the box next to it using the provided paints or seeds and masking tools.  It was a pleasure to think through these challenges and the price is right for this sort of game.  The seed levels were the most challenging to me.
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|all I have to say is<br />GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />It really addictive and fun I've never played a better<br />math game than this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I thought this game was excellent. It made me think inside and outside the box. I was challenged which I love. I look forward to more levels.
1623360277|5.0|For health reasons, i've had to change my diet.  This book tells me all i need to know for preparing foods.  And it has been really good in helping me with my weight loss also.  I expect to see my cholesterol greatly changed for the better.  Thanks for Amazon, it's a great place for ordering books.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is a wonderful movie!  It is one everyone should watch to see that life goes on even after 60, you just have to keep LIVING IT.  I am afraid the movie will be over looked by many young people, but it is truly an eye opening fun movie.  Love all the actors, Judy Dench, Bill Nighy and Maggie Smith being some of my favorites.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I did not find this to be a riveting book but it was a pretty fun read.  It'll be interesting to see how close the movie will be to the book
B007V2UGPE|4.0|U can choose a side, the zombie side seems to be more fun. My 9 year old was obsessed with it for all of 3 days:)
1400069289|5.0|Excellent book dealing with how powerful out habits predict our outcomes.  Excellent questions at the end of each chapter to encourage you to think deeper into your own life.
B005XUC398|5.0|A true gem, hidden among the usual fake business-drama crap.  Kevin Spacey is, as always, phenomenal.  Demi Moore is wonderful, as is Stanley Tucci, as usual.  Just watch it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is series gives a great insight into the impact of the First World  War on England's people, both royalty and the commoners.  The acting is just superb.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it!!!  Once you get to the higher levels with more entries, it really challenges your brain in order to meet them all while filling in all the blocks.  Highly recommend this game.
0374275637|4.0|Very indepth and good information.  I enjoy reading books that challenge me to stretch myself.<br />Would recommend others to read this book.
0446571415|3.0|Enjoyed the Camel Club but this entry in the series was slow going for me and took a long time to get into. I was not engaged by the characters and the Camel Club members take a backseat in this entry as bit players for most of the book. Always nice to read about Stone but not one of the best in the series. Got really tired to going back to that damn park again and again.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|What I found most interesting about this book is that the different governments' reactions are believable.  That scares me.  Great book.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|The game is easy enough that even I can play it. I like that there is no time limit for the games and that they can be played until they're won.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Amazingly well-written, the plot twists and turns and the characters have so many layers and so much depth. I couldn't put it down!
1781162646|4.0|Must say that I have been a fan of King's writing for years. This book features a coming of age story with all the angst of the Summer of '42 meets Holden Caulfield in an amusement park. The story engaged me partly due to the shore setting, one I am very familiar with. The mystery was satisfying enough and our hero does develop along the way of solving the old crime.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|This shows up on your Kindle Fire as an available app, but it does NOT work on a Kindle Fire.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|really fun app. I could play it all day long. I think some of them are hard but still a lot of fun
0521397812|4.0|I bought this hoping it would help give warm up ideas for my advanced class of English learners. It helped a bit but I think it would be better for lower levels
044024613X|5.0|No easy endings or solutions. This one will stick with you. I look forward to reading more from William Landay.
B000M39HB8|5.0|I love old movies, I love Bing and Fred, I love Christmas movies.  This is a Christmas classic, cute story, wonderful music.
B000P0J0AG|5.0|I have always liked Al Pacino.  I do wish he and Robert De Nero would work together more.  Al Pacino can portray so many different characters and all believable. If you are a Al Pacino fan (or even a De Nero fan) I think you'll like it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Get this app because it's really funny and you still get a challenge but it's really cool. And it is fun for the kids to enjoy and giggle and laugh about. You should try it.
B007NESBK2|5.0|Really enjoyed the concert. It was everything I expected and more. Great performance, Great sound, And just great music, By a great artist.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A great reproduction of a classic game.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs to be kept occupied on a journey or even over a tea-break.  Guess what though its FREE!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not just mindless fun, but fun just the same . Love games that make you think and use your brain. Not too hard or too easy.
B004VD3YIM|4.0|The two older TRENDNET cameras we have (TV-IP 512WN) works great on the home network and via Inernet.  We purchased two additional TRENDNET cameras (TV-IP 751WIC and TV-IP 851WIC) that are not currently supported.  We were able to use the TV-IP 551WI setting with encrypted password to view both cameras on the home network but can't view via Internet.  Would like to see support on these cameras on the next update.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|i love this app so much...ever since youtube changed...it allows you to listen much without having to get a Adobe flash player...and doesn't require persnal information
B0066WJLU6|3.0|It does what I need it to do. aAs my phone doesn't have a 'built-in' flashlight, this is handy. Nothing special, just a working light.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book. I almost didn't read it based on the other reviews. I am thrilled there are more coming. I absolutely loved this book. It was a fast read. I wish it was longer but it was true to the first 3 books. I can't wait for the next one.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved the entire series. Not just a sex book. Adored the story line. Leaves you wanting to know more about the characters.
B00CS65QGW|4.0|This song has an hypnotic beat that gets you toes a tappin.<br />Great dance and party song, sure to get everyone movin.
B00A44HRG2|2.0|Only camera that I could access was in Japan, aimed at someone's TEDDY BEAR. Really? Lame.... any which way you slice it.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I love movies with these types of settings. The actors and writing are both great. I hope there are more series like this one.
0143118706|5.0|This should be required reading for every 18 year old.  Wish I had had it back then.  Educational and entertaining.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I WAS PLEASED WITH THE SET AND HOPE THERE IS ANOTHER SERIES TO COME.<br />REALLY NOT MUCH MORE TO SAY.
B008Y73940|5.0|The movie is a well done old fashion whodunit with a twist at the end.<br />I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining action mystery.<br />Sit back & enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not just another sappy love story. hunger games let's you crawl right inside the story! A very good read. Bravo!
B007RCJNDE|5.0|couldn't put it down but didn't want to finish it, my word what a finish to a wonderful series, I think I might go back and read them all again.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Dave Grohl is the star of his show. His passion for Sound City's legacy is evident in every shot. It's not perfect but that part of why it works so well. Long live Rock and Roll.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Daniel Craig is a great James Bond.  I think he is my favorite.  The woman are hot. And did I say that there was a lot of action in the movie.  Best Bond yet!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The book fulfills the intention of the author to make readable to people with analytical minds what most biblical scholars (fundamentalists not included) have been discussing among themselves for the last fifty years.  I suspect the publishers pushed Aslan to create a title that would be somewhat controversial.  I might have titled it, Jesus the man, the myth, the legend.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|It is surprising, and gratifying, to find dialog with a sense of humor - most games seem to have neither the time nor the inclination to attempt to be funny - I guess they feel one should be serious when one is saving the world. This is the only game besides the Bards Tale where they seem to be enjoying their creation.
B006W0QR1S|3.0|The movie has some really violent scenes. The character development is weak along with a weak plot line.  Carey Mulligan had about 5 lines; her role consisted of looking perplexed. Ryan Gosling looks handsome on screen...that was the best part : /
B009W6OXB0|5.0|Bruno Mars never ceases to amaze. I would also like to applaud the mastering job done with this album (vinyl).
140006922X|5.0|I don't agree with all that Reza has to say about this historical figure of Christ, Much is his own conclusions from the Study he has done. But the book is a scholarly work, its well written.  Is the book some Muslim tirade at Christianity, no Reza does write what he said in the Fox interview, its a book about the historical figure of Christ. Its not a book about faith, its about history. Its actually very interesting. My personal conclusion is that if only every Christian would know as much about Christ as Reza. I think he sincerely does lay out his research in an unbiased and intellectual way. I don't think he should be written off as a muslim author who is somehow trying to debunk Christian faith. All he is trying to do is lay the facts out and draw his conclusions from the historical facts. So 5 stars to the book, and thanks for FOX for launching Reza on the world stage.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|May not be really related to Jason Bourne, but the lineage makes sense and the action sequence is good. Nice move to watch and should be a time well spent for most folks.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Really fun game.  Addictive. Highly recommend for anyone needing a good game to kill time.  Looking forward to an update that adds more levels.
B001PSGF3C|5.0|Halle Berry plays an amazing role in this movie! Definitely a thrilling story with an even more thrilling ending! I give it 5 stars!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I've played Mahjong on a board for a while. I get the same excitement from this app. Way to go, guys. Keep an coming.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I'm so impatient it's annoying so I love Amazon MP3 and Amazon Cloud Player. If I have access to an Internet capable device my music is just a few clicks away.
B003SI3URQ|5.0|Everyone has seen it, but it often gets overlooked when you are looking for a good disney movie to see again.<br /><br />The movies Director duo John Musker and Robert Clements have been a very underutilized and unrecognized duo for Disney putting together such greats as Aladin, The little Mermaid and Princess and the Frog. I can't wait for them to reunite for another disney movie in the future.<br /><br />Rotten Tomato has this to say &#34;Fast-paced and packed with dozens of pop culture references, Hercules might not measure up with the true classics of the Disney pantheon, but it's still plenty of fun.&#34;
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It's perfect for waking you up for school in the morning, the stopwatch feature is nice to. The apps math problems are perfect for getting your brain going, it has feature for when your setting the alarm noise to wake you up could be Pandora or another radio app
0783240287|5.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber demonstrated his masterful talents when composing Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.<br />The varied music genres and attention to the detail of the story are enough to pull you back to watching (or at least listening to) it over and over again.  I was delighted to find it!
B002U9JEVA|5.0|If you're a Norah Jones fan you already know what an amazing voice she has. Go ahead and hit 'Buy' you'll be glad you did. The only problem I have with this CD is the fact that I fall asleep before I get past the third song!
B006RZZ9YY|5.0|Many children this day and age grow up in split families of all sorts. This movie can really speak to the issues at hand of a child and a mother or even sister raising them all on their own while trying to handle a million of other daily life issues. Along with that the movie provides a great story that has laughs, action and heart.<br /><br />Rotten Tomatos says<br />&#34;Edgier than traditional Disney fare, Lilo and Stitch explores issues of family while providing a fun and charming story.&#34;
B001ANSSDC|4.0|A nice and easy book to read.  Well written and kept me interested. I would recommend this book to read.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|What a great book to get lost into! I recommend for all fantasy world lovers! I will definitely read again, and again, and AGAIN!
B00BLYFDO2|5.0|After The Weirdness and that French thing he did, it's nice to have Iggy back just rocking through some tunes that are just FUN!
B0060CV31C|5.0|Rotten Tomatos says<br />&#34;The Emperor's New Groove isn't the most ambitious animated film, but its brisk pace, fresh characters, and big laughs make for a great time for the whole family.&#34;<br /><br />The movie is hilarious, it gets funnier as your revisit it over the years as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This update I'm so happy, there will be dogs, fish, villages, slimes, nether portal and more herobrine and that's for pe every one  RATE THIS APP!!!!<br />  -peyt
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun game,  feels like jet pack joyride but in a different view. Fun game though needs more backgrounds or different stages.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I have read a lot of reviews about this book.  I have read this book.  This book is a history lesson, not the word of God.  When I read it, I had a copy of the bible next to me.  I just wanted to make sure the quotes were not taken out of context.  I feel Reza did a good job.  The history of the Jews during this time is written by the Romans, and it is nice to see the Jewish side of the story.  Don't look as this book is the theological work, but as a historical one.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The characters were well developed and believable. There were parts of the movie that rang true. Would recommend.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Another great song from Daft Punk with the Addition Of Pharrell, everything he touches is a hit these days and it's no Luck it's TALENT!!!
B0091X2K0A|5.0|I've watched this movie many times and it's really like two movies in one. I would highly recommend it. The HD version streamed perfectly on my Kindle Fire HD.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I've always love Michael Jackson's music and style.  The Thriller, 25th Anniversary Edition is the bomb.  The CD makes you wanna dance and the DVD makes you wanna watch over and over again and maybe even dance along with it.  Especially while watching the video for Thriller and Billie Jean, you'll want to get up and dance.
B0054SMID0|4.0|My wife really likes Matthew, so she liked the movie.<br /><br />Story is a bit gritty and adult, but the theme of a sleazy lawyer who is not what he seems come through.<br /><br />Almost seems like a sequel or even a TV show could carry on the story!
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|I was extremely excited about the second film in the Hasbro franchise, however... The Rise of Cobra fell flat in my opinion, the dialogue was empty and the characters had no &#34;Umph&#34; so to speak. Bruce Willis is always a treat, except for this film, I wanted to understand that this was a vehicle for Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock, sadly he left the heavy lifting to up and comers in the film, those with actor training.<br /><br />Sadly, this should be the &#34;retirement&#34; of a G.I. who's day's are over.
B00AYB1KHW|4.0|I enjoy zombie movies, and this is an early one, with some goofy twists and interesting. If you like zombies, you should like this.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Works really well. Only complaint is that I wasn't savvy enough to know that I needed an adapter plug, and the packaging didn't tell me.  Fortunately I have a 15 year old granddaughter who knew, and had an extra adapter.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Simple and easy to use.  It saves your information and go back to check your bids, and I get email notifications in my mobile.
B002ZG997C|5.0|The DVD was in perfect condition when it arrived & was just like you would find in the store. Love this movie! <3333
B006S01GH2|4.0|I enjoyed this ---- kind of off the wall goofy with a decent story line, and a good ending. Try it.
B002ZBZNPO|4.0|I prefer Fallen and the newest album Evanescence to The Open Door but there are really great songs on this album too.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I should have found this APP sooner. Now I get a sound when my battery is low. I know how much I need to run each programs.
B005HSL626|2.0|Boring, not really that much fun. Way to repetive. The graphics and colors are good. It is a last resort game.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Information is great. I like to call it the fast life since it is not a diet but a way to live life!
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|This movie was garbage! Do not watch it, if you enjoyed the first then don't bother watching this. it sucked.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|If like old Black Sabbath  then get this cd. It reminds me of the first album, it has that feel
1612183956|4.0|Damn, but it's been a very long time since a book sucked me in as quickly, and as deeply, as Pines did. I originally picked this up a few months ago, after hearing it favorably compared to Twin Peaks, but I didn't really have any concrete plans as to when I'd give it a read. Sure, hearing that Blake Crouch shared my agonizing frustration with that series-ending cliffhanger served to whet my appetite even further (\\"How's Annie?\\" indeed, Agent Cooper), but I had a pretty busy summer of back-to-back series reads planned.<br /><br />Then, of course, the good folks at Thomas & Mercer had to go and offer me an ARC for Wayward, the second book in the series. How could I refuse? Suddenly, I had another back-to-back series read suddenly wedged into my schedule . . . and what a read that first book was!<br /><br />Reminding me as much (and perhaps even more) of The Twilight Zone and Nowhere Man, with a healthy dose of The X-Files and The Prisoner mixed in, this is a story that starts out kind of creepy and strange, gets weirder as it goes on, and then twists into something completely unexpected by the end. I'm finding it a hard book to write about without getting knee-deep in spoilers, simply because the twists are very much integral to the story. It all starts with a gentleman waking up beside a stream-bed, battered, bruised, disoriented, and missing not just his wallet, keys, and cellphone, but his memory. He sets out, naturally enough, to find some clue as to who he is, where he is, and what's happened to him.<br /><br />As it turns out, those answers are far harder to come by than we might expect, and the answers we do get only open up deeper mysteries. It's a confusing way to enter the story, but Crouch does an amazing job of forcing us to identify with Ethan Burke, making us share in his frustrated disorientation. However, it's not until he discovers the tiny speaker hidden in the bushes, artificially providing the noise of night-time crickets, that the shivers really begin to creep up your spine. By the time he finds himself hospitalized against his will, the only patient in an otherwise empty floor, with a too-perfect nurse who seems incapable of delivering upon the smallest promise, we really begin to wonder what's going on.<br /><br />I could go on and on about the too-difficult sheriff, the too-kind bartender, the dead body in the abandoned house, the urgent calls home that go unanswered, the creepy kids, and the entire Mayberry-esque town of Wayward Pines, but that only brings us through the first few chapters.<br /><br />Pines is a book that wastes no time on pleasantries or filler. It's a fast-paced thriller where every scene matters, where every interaction is of significant consequence. To Crouch's credit, he maintains the suspense throughout, never faltering in the way he keeps us on edge. I really had no idea what was going on, but I was completely invested in finding out. Thanks largely to a back-story involving Gulf War torture and marital infidelity, Burke makes for sympathetic protagonist. We want him to find the answers as much for himself as for us, and that's what makes the novel really work.<br /><br />Having said all that, the ending was a little - okay, a lot - more 'out there' than I anticipated, to the point where I really had to think about whether or not it satisfied me. It was bold and brilliant, absolutely, but far from what I was expecting. Looking back, there are certainly enough clues to back it up, so it doesn't feel like a cheat, and it really does provide that same feeling of being kicked in the stomach that The Twilight Zone did so well. I suspect I won't know whether I liked it or not until I get through Wayward, but I certainly admire the audacity of it.<br /><br />A great read, and given that I devoured the final 200 pages in one sitting, I can honestly say it's one you won't be able to put down.egin to creep up your spine.

B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I love this music and I can't stop listening to it! VERY POWERFUL! I recommend this soundtrack to all my friends!
B002RKSZS0|5.0|Fun and historically accurate, this book is a romp through England's earliest whirlwind courtship days. I enjoyed its tongue in cheek humor as well as the story and characters.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|We loved the book and love the movie, awaiting parts two and three. What can I say, I read the Hobbit more than once when I was younger
B004T4LUPW|4.0|The calendar connects well to Google and it shows everything.  I love it for that.  The interface for modifying and/or adding events is a little cumbersome ... BUT I love the product otherwise.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Imaginative and colorful. Interesting approach to what it might have been like before Dorothy enters the picture. Beautiful in 3D! Thumbs up for family entertainment.
B00BTYHBXA|5.0|I'm teaching a class on environmental science and I found this very helpful.  If Gore had been this passionate on the campaign trail he might have won.
B008BHAV9Y|3.0|Musically, this album is really really yeehaw country - personally too much so for my tastes, but I wanted to get it because of Mark Knopfler.<br /><br />Sonically, it is a very good recording, but I don't feel that it has anything on a \\"regular\\", 44.1kHz, 16-bit, high-quality CD recording. I have taken very good care of my hearing. We get tested every year at work and I still have excellent hearing. I also have fairly good equipment, but I can't hear a justification for these $40 and $50 CDs. As such - that no justification exists - I probably won't be buying any more of these K2HD Master discs.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|It's fun and challenging to play. Keeps your attention for a long time. If it had a multiplayer mode a 5 star would be the proper score.
0061564893|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone interested in the real history of the world and anyone doubting if Columbus really &#34;discovered&#34; the Americas. Difficult read but interesting theory with thorough references.
0688156819|4.0|This book was a fun read with interesting illustrations.  Tim Burton fans must buy it.  Not for children.<br /><br />Plate on the front of the book was a bit loose, reglued it and all is well.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|You're not going to jump up and down with excitement when you use this app, but it is very handy.  It feels like a feature the device should have come with as part of it's OS. Very good app, worth paying for.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|Sublime sexy movie not only obvious but story plot actors clothing .....just perfect. Have watched it over and over. Recently with someone who was reluctant but loved it
B0051XQI84|5.0|My kids and I really enjoy this movie. If you don't like Jack Black than I would not recommend  this movie. This movie definitely has a Jack Black feel.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My only complaint is that it could have been chapters and chapters longer. Definitely the most intriguing game I've played in a long-time.
B009GX69RK|5.0|If you're looking for a good laugh, and enjoy a coming of age story this is perfect. I find that although the main protagonist, Jess, is unique; her situations and life events are relatable to young adults who are finding themselves, like Jess. Supporting actors each bring something special to the show, making it complete. Looking forward to season 3!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is easily one of the best books I've read in a long time.  It is packed with action on virtually page, making it difficult to put the book down once you've started.  I've read other David Baldacci books, but this one and its sequel, The Hit, are by far and away his best.  I might add that my favorite author over many years is Clive Cussler, whose earlier, single-authored books, such as Dragon and Raise the Titanic, are the best I've ever read.  However, these Baldacci books are as good as some of Cussler's best.<br /><br />Both of the Baldacci books feature Will Robie, who is essentially the American James Bond.  What Bond was to the British MI6, Robie is to the U.S. CIA.  Leading a life of constant danger, Robie, a CIA assassin, has extreme skills and repeatedly extricates himself and others from deadly situations.  Baldacci also gives his central character a human side that leads him to help, support, and save those around him.  If you're an action-adventure fan, I can absolutely guarantee that you'll love this book.

B00CO8D3G4|3.0|Sound advice for those looking to move into the self-employed.  His basic message is one of there is no time like the present to get started in your new career as a self-employed entrepreneur and to remain resilient in the face of adversity. He writes from experience having had many setbacks himself.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|With a well-fleshed, slightly comedic script, you pretty much can't lose with actors the like of Willis, Freeman, Malkovich, and Mirren.  Pop the corn, get a refreshing adult beverage, put your feet up and just enjoy this movie.  It's a romp.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its very Addicting. most awesome fun Ive had in any game in a long time.cant wait for number 2 if there is one that would be awesome.

B00CS65QGW|5.0|Now the first thing that came to my mind with this song, is Roller Disco. Again another Awesome song! The song is mostly repetitive in the words, but make up for it in the music. If there was Roller Disco Olympics, this would be my competition song. The music is so smooth and free moving. Makes you feel like a dancing gypsy. So much happy feeling in this song. So relaxing to hear. I literary drift away when I listen to it. Put on a pair of roller skates and just move to the soft flowing sounds of this song. Ahhhh! Pure Bliss. I recommend this song for all to listen to.
B00973902K|4.0|A fun song, and it was just what I expected given my love for the song on the radio. I love this addition to my Cloud player.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|It was an interesting take on what would happen to governments and society after an extremely devastating pandemic. More intellectual read than blood and gore.
B000W93CHC|5.0|AFter reading this book I have found a renewed interest in the middle ages...The good and the bad of people never fails to amaze me.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|Never gets old. And at the time of purchase this blue ray set price was a 'must have'. Grabbed it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've read countless reviews on this book, and none seem to capture the true essence of this book. I'm not saying mine will, but I want to try.<br /><br />Being the Slammed fanatic that I am, I was very eager to begin this book. I kept an open mind, because I didn't want to be let down if the book was to not be as amazing as Slammed. However, I have never felt as connected to a book as I did reading Hopeless. I have no relation to this book, but I felt as though I went through all the torture Sky did. My heart ached, I cried, I was filled with joy, and I felt the hope right along with her.  The way I felt connected to these characters was amazing.<br /><br />Sky is hauntingly strong, brave, smart, witty, and fearless. She is by far my favorite character in any book I have ever read. She has such a huge heart and is so compassionate. Her ability to love people despite their dark sides is so admirable. She showed me that it was okay to hate the bad in someone and love the good in them, and that will stay with me forever.<br /><br />Holder is terrifying, because he is so perfectly passionate. His life has been filled with so much despair and heartache yet he didn't give up, even when it would have been much easier for him to. How could someone not fall for this Hopeless boy? It would be impossible. He has a way of completely terrifying and intriguing you all at the same time, while making you feel so safe right along with it.<br /><br />The way Coleen deals with the sensitive topics addressed in this book is brilliant. She approaches them with such realness, she doesn't sugar coat, which is refreshing. These things happen, and it's about time an author isbrave enough to approach them with such openness.<br /><br />All in all, I would suggest this book to anyone and everyone. Bravo, Colleen, bravo.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thought it was a very good book and appropriate for teens. It had me reading it in one sitting! Very good!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|this works even better than the one that came with my kindle love it no problems whatever great quality product
B008D30K7E|5.0|It's a long time since I read a book that made me laugh out loud so much.  It's absolutely hilarious in parts.  The plot line is so unusual and the characters are brilliantly portrayed. I will certainly be telling famiLy and friends to read this book.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love mlp and I love this game! Best thing is there's so many ways to get free gems. I've always liked games like that.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Great!! I rate it 5 bananas out of 5 bananas..... or however you view what I have just said o.o
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The story is beautiful and beautifully written!!  I learned all about what each flower is called and why. Fascinating read!!
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Well when it's not flashing amounts to pay to play its fun but unless I'm missing something the game switches to site where I have to pay to by tokins or wait 45 Min to scratch off cards for free toxins.<br />Fun when it works, frustrating when wanting $$$$$
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Phenomenal fun. Great character interplay. My wife said as we exited the theater viewing: 'I think that was better than the original Star Wars!'
B00499NHLC|5.0|I love it, but not for diehard, old-fashioned SH fans. Maybe SH needed a little modern redo for a new audience.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Game has declined since last few updates. Making it harder&amp; harder to play for free. The difficulty isn't harder, you just get screwed more if you don't pay real money for items.
B008AVXGA2|5.0|I loved this fairy tale-style children's story that was part Russian fable and part modern day kids adventure. Joulia Gousseva showed her writing chops in \\"Moscow Dreams\\" and returns here to the fiction that inspired her growing up in Russia. This is a great book to buy for parents who enjoy reading to their kids and is also recommended for young readers. It's like a Russian 'Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe' and should spark the imagination of children everywhere.
B0081336FO|5.0|This is a personal rating. It's candy for my brain.<br />The acting is good, but the technical stuff could use a little improvement.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|Good series, not as good as Downton Abbey though. Character development weak in some areas, just not as exciting or enthralling as Downton.
B005VSRFEA|4.0|It was very relevant to what I'm researching in my PhD. Happy to have it on my virtual 'shelf' ;-).
1603427244|5.0|This book is well-organized, easy to use, and is very informative for a newbie like myself. I'm very pleased with it and would recommend it to someone learning to knit or who wants to advance their skills.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|the story of an Afghan family and the love of a brother and sister amidst a war torn country ruled by the rich and powerful.
1452126577|5.0|I wanted a keepsake of Grumpy Cat, but I have too many of the usual collector fair. This books fits the bill! Plenty of home pictures of Grumpy's real world. It's a funny, cute, & crude book. Be Warned-This Is Not a Kids Book. I would say to play it safe give it to someone 18 & older-not to offend any conservative parents out there. Speaking of conservative, this would NOT be a good book for anyone who is a deeply religious Christian. All I can say is it's like the plot from Freaky Friday between J.C. & Grumpy-enough said on that. It came in good condition. Timely shipping. Great item to collect. Fairly priced.
0316077046|4.0|I enjoyed the twists and turns.  I am only hoping the rest of the series is as good as this book is.  I also hope the movie is not like other movies and ventures past the first book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King's time travel novel 11/22/63 ranks among his finest books since The Stand.<br /><br />Jake Epping goes through a time portal back to the 1950s and 60s to try and stop Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating Preesident John F. Kennedy and therby change history. An intriguing and interesting concept and King carries it off marvelously, capturing the 50s and 60s perfectly with numerous trivia tidbits. It's a trip back down memory lane for me.<br /><br />I highly enjoyed this book and it moves along quite well. Some great characters and Stephen King writing at his best. It falters a bit in the middle where he gets sidetracked. Typical of King in his later novels. It's a huge book and slightly over written. King is in desperate need of a good editor to reign in his excesses. But I guess he is too big a name and seller for anyone to have the nerve to tell him to curtail some things. He gets away with it.<br /><br />But people still buy his books and well they should. He is one of the great storytellers of our generation. I think the book is a bit overpriced at $21 for Kindle, but it is over 800 pages and a damn good read. Highly recommended.
0805047905|5.0|My niece loves it, I love it.  Her teacher is a fan.  The best book for beginning readers is Brown Bear, Brown Bear.

B000002GB2|5.0|I absolutely loved this album back when Styx REALLY ROCKED!  And now that I have it again, I still play it all the time.
B00DVXVMT6|4.0|I feel this is way solid. Yes I don't agree with some of the solo's cause it really does not fit to the song and it takes you out of the song. Like All That's Left is Blood. I'm so into and then this solo breaks out. I think to myself \\"Well it's talent\\" but does not fit to the tune. That I don't dig but so be it. They are showing off their new talent and not to many hardcore bands can showcase this kind of talent. I think it's well written. Yes I do have discrepancies but all in all I think this solid I will listen to tunes over and over on it. Plastic Wonderland... Probably not It is pretty weak to me .
B00CWY76CC|5.0|why do I like lets see kinda like a mystery I love mysterys and most thing your trying to open and elevator finding stuff how bout if I like you should like it but it is omall you if you want to download it not my in is not my eltronic bye this<br />by tyra

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote deserves more than the five stars. It can keep everything organized even across platforms. Glad I own it. You will be too.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent period drama made rich by the extremely talented cast.  Very entertaining viewing and would recommend it for all ages.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Broad scope linear coverage of actions and reactions through the use of reincarnation ro connect the storyline. Well written, entertaining to the end. Much easier to follow stroyline in the novel then in the movie where  I kept getting lost.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This is such a great book! It's a little slow at first but as you read on you find yourself not wanting to put the book down!! He tells a great story.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I would recommend this book to a reader who enjoys legal thrillers. Although not a typical one, it keeps the reader guessing as to the guilt of the accused.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Pirates and treasure maps, who could ask for anything more. A perfect movie for an adult with a childlike smile and a grownup imagination.
B00BRH2MN8|4.0|Royals, that is enough to make this EP great. You can call her Queen Bee Lorde is writing and experimenting like none other currently. She is F.R.E.S.H. and worth the purchase.
B006LSZECO|3.0|They story was interesting and I enjoyed the narration by the two alternating speakers. However the reading experience was spoiled for me by the incessant use of the f word which was not only offensive but also tiresome and annoying. Enough already--get a dictionary--pick a few new words!
B0035JLVWY|5.0|Great acting and script.  A real fave.  Ed Norton, Laura Linney and Richard Gere, plus Andre Braugher and Maura Tierney -- all excellent.
B00C0NFMKI|4.0|This album shows a lot of growth and style, songs carry traits of pop, rock and gospel. I give it four stars and not 5 because it is solid but lacks the album cohesiveness or song that makes a definitive statement. Still this is a good album.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The minions are sooo cute and I love that you can get lots of outfits for them. Plus its free
B005HEVBGG|5.0|The Season 1 of the series Star Trek Voyager is a great show as all the other Star Trek series. I really recommend this show!
B0090SI582|3.0|Wolverine was a good movie, but I just wanted to ask the producers and directors one question. *SPOILER ALERT*  Were the ninjas' swords made of adamantium?  Because Wolverine's claws would have cut right through them, and throughout the whole movie they were able to fight him face on with their swords.  I thought adamantium was a rare metal.  Why would a bunch of foot soldiers be worth holding on to adamantium?  Just food for thought.
B008UX8G5A|4.0|Very well written for anyone interested in the reign of Henry VIII.  Fantastic personal details complement amazing historical events.  I read this as I watched The Tudors (the showtime series), which made it helpful to put faces with names.  Really, I couldn't put it down!!
0446547646|5.0|After reading this great book can not wait for the movie to come out.<br />Great read for everyone and am sure the movie will be just as wonderful..
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Don't know if I could ever go on a hike like that, especially by myself.  She meets interesting people along the way; and some obstacles along the way.  Just don't think I could sleep in the wilderness all by myself.  And I think of myself as being pretty brave.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|when I got this movie and viewed it I was not disappointed and in fact sometimes I watch it a bit more than I usually  if fact I got my sister addicted to it
0440245206|5.0|Danielle Steel continues to deliver a story that keeps a reader going until the end and asking for more at the finish.<br />Beautifully written.<br />Gladly recommend this book to all readers.
0525478817|5.0|John Green has quickly become one of my favorite authors, and this book is definitely one of my favorites. Clever writing, easy to read and so addicting I just had to finish the whole thing is one day.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|this movie presents what should have been viewed as the beginning of the oz movie that stared judy garland.  This movie helps the viewers to understand how it all began so when that movie was shown after the characters In the judy garland movie would have made more sense
B0053KWDES|5.0|Use this with my M50 and PC.  The sound card did not drive the headphones anywhere near their capability.  With the E11 I get much fuller sound spectrum listening to a variety of music genres.  I generally keep the AQ off, boost on low, and the volume at around the 5 setting (unless listening to electronic music, when I set the EQ to 1 and the boost to high)<br /><br />Only inconvenience, is it cannot be used while charging, but the gain in sound is much worth it.
014241493X|5.0|In typical John Green fashion, this book keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Great read, highly recommend it to an audience of all ages.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I jounced the book to be a bit disjointed,  I felt like there were some loose ends.  I must admit though that I enjoyed reading it, I just expected more to come when it ended somewhat abruptly.  The more I think about it I make connections, but still left wanting more.
1451695187|4.0|While Dr Alexander relates to us in detail with medical explanation his 'time' in heaven, it still remains a matter of faith as to what one believes.  He 'knows what he knows' not because of medical fact and knowledge but because of his faith....for if he did not have that he would not have made the journey and had the experience he did.  'For by faith are you saved....Ephesians 2:8'
B009DCOU9S|4.0|If you like games that require good observational skills and a little bit of brain teasing then this would be a game for you.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Absolutely love playing this game. Use to play this as a child, but never had all these best twists and turns which makes the game that much better. Highly recommend this for people of all ages.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is probably the greatest book I have ever read, rivaled only by Harry Potter or maybe the Hunger Games. I am a huge fantasy fan, and after Harry Potter, I thought that I would never find a book like that again. Boy, was I wrong. I was hooked from the very first page. I finished the book within 2 days or so. It is very well written and has humor in all of the right places. When I first heard of it, I thought it would be some sappy romance. But no! Violence at every turn! This is an awesome book, and I reccomend it for ages 13+
0743277465|5.0|This book is more of an autobiography of sorts detailing the learning and performance aspect of Josh's life. It has many great lessons, but it's not really about the art of learning. It was a very interesting and lively read though, one I greatly enjoyed, and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I have not personal interest in chess or Tai Chi, but I still loved it and found it stimulating.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My niece gave me her copy of series one and two. Great show. Can't hardly wait for series four. Good entertainment.
B0064Y5U24|5.0|good inspiration to fuel action when writing a fighting scene in a story or a difficult situation that test a relationship.

B008Y6WMEY|3.0|A romp through some very serious events. The actors all did a great performance with the tongue in cheek subject. By keeping in mind how the seriousness was being spoofed there are many funny, sarcastic, moments scattered along the way.

B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Jennifer is perhaps a talented actress, but this movie certainly is not, IMHO. I stayed for about twenty minutes and gave up. I do not know what all the publicity is about, but it is not for my tastes.

B00AKO93JK|5.0|This is a great exercise app.  You are given the option of 2 different prepared programs or you can design your own routine.  You have the option of 5, 8 or 10 minute routines.  I like to stream to my television so I can better see the exercise being performed.  I bought the extra exercises (ball, stretch, pilates, and kettlebell) after using the base programs for a while.  They have become part of my daily workout.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|As documentary films go this one is exceptionally long at just over 3 hours, but even if you don't know this iconic American rock/country band very well you'll likely find every minute both informative and entertaining. The story is told in flashback by the various band members over the years and is joyous, witty, good-natured and deeply acrimonious by turns.<br /><br />The narrative is roughly chronological from the band's beginnings as (believe it or not) Linda Ronstadt's backing group, through international success (and excess) in the mid-1970s, to 21st century revival & survival. Music producers, past managers and other professionals from the industry chip in with wry observations and anecdotes about the band and its famous internal tensions, particularly the ill-feeling between on the one side the main songwriters and core members Don Henley and Glenn Frey, and on the other side guitarist Don Felder who in 2001 after 26 years of increasing tensions was `fired' by the other members of the band - the only Eagle to suffer such indignity. Felder initiated a $50million lawsuit as a consequence.<br /><br />There is plenty of truly great concert footage and fly-on-the-wall detail showing how the band composed its most famous numbers. Joe Walsh in particular shines brightly both as a musician and as a character, and his segments always entertain.<br /><br />On deciding to `re-form' in 1994 following a 14-year hiatus, most of the band seriously wondered: \\"if we go back on the road and book some concert dates, will anyone show up?\\" They needn't have worried; their shows continue to attract huge audiences worldwide and younger generations of new fans have become converts in droves.<br /><br />For the Eagles fan this will of course be essential viewing, but even for the viewer not particularly interested in rock music this film offers a highly entertaining three hours. You may never have bought an album or single by The Eagles in your life, yet will likely be amazed how many of their iconic songs you know and recognise. Theirs was one of the defining sounds of the 1970s and this American music will probably live forever in the hearts of millions.ny of their iconic songs you know and recognise.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Sometimes the app glitches but the graphics are actually fantastic for a free app :p so yah u should get it just be patient... if u don't have patience it may be annoying
B004S5FVJS|3.0|Some lazy writing at different points - becomes a little predictable at times. The basic plot is solid but I think that it deserved a more complex approach - too simple in most respects.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|The characterization was good, but the plot structure left a lot to be desired. It was a lot of drawn-out drama for a dissatisfying ending. I think the book could really use some editing and some partial rewrites.<br /><br />That said, it led to an interesting book club discussion, especially about the psychology and motivations of various characters (spoilers!). Because of the great discussion it inspired, I might still recommend it to others. Personally, though, I won't pick it back up myself.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My son downloaded it and he said it took a long time but he loves the game and fights me when I tell him to take a break
B005LUJWBM|4.0|As usual, great plot with complex characters. Kept you guessing until the end. There were some convenient and slightly unbelieveable parts but for a book that was written just as the net revolution was beginning it is surpisingly on the mark. God researching.
0525421033|5.0|Heartwarming book.  Right up to the last minute you are praying she will go in the direction you want her to go.  I highly recommend this &#34;food for thought&#34; book.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|The game is great. What isn't great is that it is not compatible with my S Note II or my Galaxy Tab. Makes it useless to me since I can't play the game. I will give it 5 stars when it is compatible with my devices since it clearly states Android 2.3 or higher and I am obviously running higher software than 2.3.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series.  Lets me experience first hand how some of my ancestors lived.  Cannot wait for Season 4 to begin.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest! Its a great way to share photos and be creative and share that creativity with other people. Its also really fun to see what pics other people posted. If your a fan of social networking, then you'll love this.

B006AZZPCM|3.0|When I first got this app  for my Kindle Fire in 2012, it worked PERFECTLY, but lately it has been acting up. It used to let me download any video I wanted to whether or not i could watch it on a mobile device. Now, it won't let me watch Vevo or any other channels by official businesses such as Huly or Fox! I looked all over the internet for a solution (even on their site) and found nothing. Please fix this, TubeMate!!!!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Nice to watch a movie that depends on dialogue and interaction of characters rather than nonstop action, violence, and special effects to supposedly maintain viewer interest. All the bang-bang, shoot-em-up, and blow-em-up bores the hell out of me.
B007BVOEPI|1.0|it was just too bloody. there is no reason for all the violence. The intrigue is good and some of the characters are interesting, but it isn't worth it
B000065V42|5.0|Fast service, good quality DVD, and a fun movie to watch with my  3 and 5-yr old grandchildren.  Got them to use their imagination about what it would be like to be so tiny.

B009XIXVU6|3.0|Especially in comparison to Kite Runner and A Thousan Splendid Suns. Characters and their story lines were introduced but then went no where and didn't to relate to the theme of the main story. My book club agreed that the author seemed to have many potentially &#34;stand alone&#34; stories that could have been developed into subsequent books. Instead he chose to combine the partial ideas into a hodgepodge that fell flat.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|all the positive reviews I read, led me to buy this for my wife. All the negative review, I sorted out. I concluded this was worth a chance for the price. Most of the negative reviews where about hooking up to wifi. It took a little bit of figuring out. maybe fifteen minutes or so. finally got to where they asked for my router password. No problem , great signal. Worth the price, my wife likes facebook , some games, as a book reader, its the best. Downloaded the kindle app from amazon and she reading her books. I may purchase another one just to read book. excellent reader. I bought her a book on amazon and with the kindle app, she loves it. It does everything a kindle does. love it

140006922X|2.0|I bought this book and have read it through.<br /><br />I had a bad feeling about this book when I first heard of it, listening to an interview with the author on NPR. He referred to himself as a historian, and said that he was trying to have a look at who the real historical Jesus was. This set off two red flags. First, Reza Aslan is not a historian. Second, no one can say anything with confidence about the historical Jesus. Hardly any written references to Jesus and his movement exist outside those in the New Testament, so the only way anyone can construct an alternative Jesus is to cherrypick the scriptures under the influence of personal bias, and that's been done quite enough already.<br /><br />But I enjoyed Aslan's book No god but God, and I didn't want to prejudge, so I bought a copy. While waiting for the book to arrive, however, I read two critiques that increased my doubts.<br /><br />First the medievalist Charlotte Allen wrote an Op-Ed in the LA Times (August 4, 2013, page A25), in which she accused Aslan, as I had suspected, of cherrypicking the scriptures `as often as any fundamentalist preacher.' Then, the next day, the New York Times published its review, written by Dale Martin, a chaired professor of religious studies at Yale. It's a harsh review, again accusing Aslan of being capriciously skeptical about some parts of the scriptures, and too credulous about others. At the end, Prof. Martin actually spanked Aslan for being a professor of creative writing rather than a true scholar of ancient Judaism and Christianity. For one academic to publicly put a colleague in his place this way is unusual and, as I said, pretty harsh.<br /><br />So by the time the book arrived I was almost feeling sympathy for Reza Aslan. Then I read the book for myself, and quickly began to feel that Dale Martin was too soft. What Reza Aslan has produced is a novelization of the life of Jesus structured as a historical analysis. It isn't even all that well written, once you take into account how repetitive it is. Some of the repetition is so direct, and so unremarked upon by the author, that it seems like a simple editing oversight.<br /><br />More importantly, the book is dishonest in the sense that it is written so as to seem more original than it really is. Dale Martin noted that Aslan should have noted more clearly the similarity of his thesis (that Jesus was not a pacifist interested only in the next life but rather a conventional Jewish revolutionary with earthly, political goals) to those of earlier authors, specifically S.G.F. Brandon, author of `Jesus and the Zealots.' I would add another book: Hyam Maccoby's `The Mythmaker.' Maccoby reasoned that because there were so many different factions of Judaism in Jesus' time, that the religious arguments Jesus has in the Gospels with other Jews (about divorce law, dietary law, etc.) would not have been out of the ordinary. Therefore, Maccoby argued, it's unlikely that these controversies would have been enough to spur the Jews to toss Jesus at Pilate's feet. It's more likely, Maccoby said, that Jesus was a political rebel against the Roman occupation and was therefore a threat to the high priest of the temple (the high priest being in essence a servant of Rome, a quisling, an insincere Jew, a traitor to the Jewish nation). This is EXACTLY what Aslan claims, yet Aslan never once notes the existence of Maccoby's book, even in his bibliography.<br /><br />To close I'll give two important examples of Aslan's cherrypicking, just to show how profound it is. First, there's the crucifixion. Nothing is more important to Aslan than the fact that Jesus was crucified. Aslan asserts that Jesus' crucifixion tells us that he definitely was a political rebel against Rome, because that's the only crime Rome crucified people for. Now imagine taking a walk in the Jim Crow south, and looking up to see the charred remains of a hanged black man in a tree. Would you conclude that he must have been a murdererbecause that is the only crime that was supposed to be punished that way? No - you would understand that miscarriages of justice were common in that time and place, and that this man might have committed a lesser crime - just about any crime, or perhaps no crime at all. The same, obviously, would be true of a crucifixion victim in an ancient Roman province. Aslan even notes himself - TWICE- on both page 47 and 149, that Pontius Pilate hated Jews and would `eagerly' and `absentmindedly' crucify them without the slightest kind of a trial. In other words, while Jesus may well have been `in fact' a political rebel of the kind that Brandon, and Maccoby, and others, and now Aslan, claim, the bare fact of his crucifixion does not by itself allow us to conclude that as Aslan directly claims.<br /><br />Finally, I have to note Aslan's abuse of Matthew 10:34, which he quotes both in the text (p 120) and on the book's first page. This is the verse in which Jesus says he has not come to bring peace but a sword. Christians have latched on to this verse for centuries, because it's one of the few verses which, if read out of context this way, can be usefully misinterpreted to suggest that the scriptural Jesus wasn't entirely a pacifist - that he understood that sometimes a physical fight is necessary. In fact, whatever and whoever the `historical Jesus' was (and again, no one knows), the SCRIPTURAL Jesus IS entirely pacifist. If you invest just a few seconds into reading Mt 10:32-39, to get a little context (better yet, read the whole chapter, the whole book, or the whole New Testament), Jesus appears to be talking about a metaphorical sword that he will use to split up nuclear families, picking out the believers for salvation and leaving the rest. He is demanding (as he does elsewhere) that his followers think of him and their fellow believers as their true family, whether they are blood relatives or not. He says that believers may find their own blood relatives to be their enemies (may find them to be nonbelievers). Of course Jesus told us to love our enemies so he's not apparently talking about war here - in other words, again, he's apparently not talking about actual, physical swords.<br /><br />But Aslan indicates (without looking at the verses surrounding 10:34, just quoting 10:34 in isolation) that Jesus IS talking about physical, metal swords. He says on p 120 that Jesus `was certainly no pacifist.' Certainly? Jesus wasn't certainly anything. We can say what he was scripturally, and we can surmise that the real Jesus was different from the scriptural Jesus, but no one knows anything `certainly.' He might have been pacifist. He might have been military-political. He might, alternatively, have been a little of each. He might have vacillated, changed his tune depending on the audience and his sense of physical risk. He might have been a bit mad. Aslan says on page 122 that when Jesus said `love your enemies' he was only referring to fellow Jews, not outsiders. But Aslan not only does not know what Jesus meant when he uttered this famous statement - he doesn't even know, no one knows, whether Jesus said it at all.<br /><br />I still would recommend Aslan's `No god but God,' but `Zealot' is a creative work presented irresponsibly, almost laughably, as history.

Coins bunch into this one glitchy megacoin, and it gets a lot worse. For some reason, it has become insensitive to my swiping and sometimes it even for it does REVERSE CONTROLS!!! No joke i am not playing it does that to me and it's annoying. I used to like it but it got stupid, hackers or just a glitch. FIX THIS!!<br /><br />P.S.

Also once you have place a number in all the places it can go, I it just removes the number as an option. What I don't like is t hat there are no other themes.

B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|\\"The RCA Albums Collection\\" will satisfy the Harryhead out there who has felt (like myself) that Harry's albums (outside of the core popular ones) didn't receive their due over the years. This extensive set supervised by Andrew Sandoval (who has supervised The Monkees and Kinks reissues among others)and remastered by Vic Anesini (who remastered the previous Nilsson deluxe editions). Unlike some reissues, this also comes with lovingly recreated mini-sleeves (although no inserts) for each album as well as an extensive book with full credits for each album, brief notes on the making and information on which ones have been previously released and those that have not.<br /><br />Although this set is missing four other releases ([[ASIN:B00DJYK3X8 Flash Harry]] and the \\"Popeye\\" soundtrack (and, of course, the demos recorded for that album done by Nilsson), it includes tracks that are essential for Harryheads. \\"Son of Dracula\\" is missing as well but, since, with the exception of one song there was nothing new there, only the hardest core fan will miss it(I do miss it since the packaging for that design was unique and very cool). The instrumental music written for \\"Skidoo\\" is also missing but the songs from that album (including the closing credits sung by Harry) are included.<br /><br />The remastering by Vic Anesini is very good with nice dynamic range. Please note that the \\"Nilsson Schmillison\\" remaster is the 2004 original (according to the CD text information that crops up on the CD player). I had also read that The Point!, Nilsson Schmilsson, Son Of Schmilsson, and A Little Touch Of Schmilsson In The Night were all the previous Anesini mastering as well--both sounded exceptionally good then so I can understand if the efforts were directed at mastering Harry's other albums that needed upgrading vs. just remastering what Vic had already done--but the text display states that they are more recent FYI.<br /><br />The handsome packaging includes fourteen of Nilsson's albums as well as three discs of rarities, previously unreleased tracks and alternate takes. Each disc also has bonus tracks that are similiar to the original deluxe CD editions. The first two albums include the rare mono mixes for Harry's albums. The list of tracks is below:<br /><br /> Ten Little Indians, 1941, Cuddly Toy, She Sang Hymns Out Of Tune, You Can't Do That, Sleep Late, My Lady Friend, She's Leaving Home, There Will Never Be, Without Her, Freckles, It's Been So Long, River Deep Mountain High, Ten Little Indians, 1941, Cuddly Toy, She Sang Hymns Out Of Tune, You Can't Do That, Sleep Late, My Lady Friend, She's Leaving Home, There Will Never Be, Without Her, Freckles, It's Been So Long, River Deep Mountain High, Daddy's Song, Good Old Desk, Don't Leave Me, Mr. Richland's Favorite Song, Little Cowboy, Together, Everybody's Talkin', I Said Goodbye To Me, Little Cowboy, Mr. Tinker, One, Wailing Of The Willow, Bath, Daddy's Song, Good Old Desk, Don't Leave Me, Mr. Richland's Favorite Song, Little Cowboy, Together, Everybody's Talkin', I Said Goodbye To Me, Little Cowboy, Mr. Tinker, One, Wailing Of The Willow, Bath, Aerial Ballet Radio Spot, Puppy Song, Nobody Cares About The Railroads Anymore, Open Your Window, Mother Nature's Son, Fairfax Rag, City Life, Mournin' Glory Story, Maybe, Marchin' Down Broadway, I Guess The Lord Must Be In New York City, Rainmaker, Mr. Bojangles, Simon Smith And His Amazing Dancing Bear, I Will Take You There [Single Mix], Waiting (From the Motion Picture \\"Jenny\\"), Rainmaker [Single Mix], Mournin' Glory Story [Single Mix], Garbage Can Ballet [Alt.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|The Game of Thrones is not for those seeking action. Page upon page of trivial information and dragging the plot slowly along. One day we will hopefully have roughly 500 page quick paced abstract of all the seven books, but until then one must continue to read those massive books as they are published.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I saw Dr Alexander give a talk about his experience, and decided to buy the Kindle book. It is worth a read, but I must admit that I was put off by the quick ending. I also think his book did not emphasize the recognition of the young lady on the butterfly, as well as he articulated during his talk. I tend to believe in an afterlife and think Dr Alexander is being honest about his experiences. I applaud his recognition that meditation is a way to help a person experience their pure consciousness, devoid of distracting thoughts and emotions.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I love this book but PLEASE realize this is a TRILOGY and you are ONLY paying for ONE book. And it ends more or less in the middle of the story so you really ought to buy all three!

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this one the best out of all the versions. It has the best graffics and addons. If you are going to play temple run this is the way to go.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|We are really enjoying the development of this story.  The actors/actresses, the writing, everything - is great.  Also, it was interesting going through WWI from a British perspective seemingly without American distortion.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|This is the most unobtrusive fitness device I've used for a long time.  It's compatibility with the Withings Smart Scale and Blood Pressure Cuff gives a full compliment of health metrics to help tailor and monitor lifestyle goals.  Well worth the money!
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Yikes, what will the serial killer writer guys think up next. Still, very engrossing. Not quite as good as The Killing, because it's a bit far fetched. But still, as I said, not bad. Haven't finished season one yet, but have watched 4 episodes. Luckily, I'm at the age (63) where no matter how gruesome something is, it just doesn't stay with me. Not like the old days when after seeing the Wizard of Oz, I would have nightmares of tornadoes.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Maybe it's because I have played few action games but this is an amazing and graphically intense gaming environment. Love it, just hope I don't end up spending a fortune on upgrades
0425263924|5.0|Awesome third book. I couldn't put it down. I hope there is another Gideon and Eva book to finish the story.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Truly a great game and worth the money! Works great on my Kindle Fire! Highlly recommended by me and everyone who grabs my Kindle Fire!
B0025WX2YW|5.0|My husband and I both enjoyed it.  So well done.  I need to find a new series this good to watch!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is the best game ever at least I think<br />Even my mom loves this game
B003MXD694|5.0|Scary for sensitive kids.  Loved it. Fun, witty script- some differences from the book. this review says I need more words...
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|lots of action and good looking men ;) not as good as the first one tho! worth the buy for sure.
B001BZGA8Y|5.0|The watch is really beautiful and the material is very good quality. The only thing is that I don't agree it's a &#34;men's&#34; watch, with those cristals around it. Anyway, it's a very choice.
B003O86FMW|5.0|the second book in the series is easily as good as the first. starts a little slower but its still riveting.  I hope the soon to be released movie does it justice
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I don't have a lot of experience with studio headphones so I don't have much to compare these with. But they are comfortable and the dynamic range I can hear while wearing them is better then anything else I own, headphones and otherwise.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|The Kindle app downloads fine but when entering any books, all that comes up is blank pages. I have tried downloading through two different sights and neither works.
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|Phones and tablets...MOBILE companions.  This morning i took my child to the doctors office and loaded this game to pass the time.... Surprise! Without wifi it wont work.  In my opinion, an app is useless if it must be connected to the internet to play.  And it makes me very suspicious about what info they may need.  Since the app requires no permissions why won't it work?  I don't see it downloading content.  Its tracking your usage.  Anyway, it does look nice but its useless on the road.  I don't normally sit at home all the time playing games so I'm deleting it.
B00ACP3OOM|4.0|I have had the Finis Neptune for about 2 months and really enjoy it.  While I am not a techie type person I had no problem loading albums from my laptop onto the device.  It also charges using the laptop and so far I have only charged it once since the original use.  It is easy to change songs without taking the unit off the goggle straps once you know which side the next track arrows are located.  The unit came with some pre-loaded songs (a few of which are truly horrible - think the Carpenters have a song on there) so those sometimes need to be skipped. I suppose I could just delete them!<br /><br />Anyhow, I did have a problem fairly quickly with the unit.  Maybe 2 weeks into using it the right side conductor stopped working. I contacted Finis and the rep said to send it back and they would send me another unit. However, I have yet to send it back b/c I really don't want to give up my music even for a few days. In the summer I swim solo quite a bit and the Neptune really helps me as I have motivation problems when I have to swim without training partners.  It really makes swimming alone go by so much quicker and I often end up swimming more than I had planned. I will send it back in a few weeks once I am back swimming indoors with my YMCA training buddies. Till then music in my left ear is better than several days without while waiting for a replacement.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Most of the reviews are true. It is a short game, if u don't want to buy diamonds. But like the others, I play until energy is out, then go do something else.  Honestly all games should be this way. I can't say I like buying diamonds, did it once but won't do it again! Good graphics, fun addictive challenging game...gotta like hidden puzzle games.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|The best piece of cinema ever made with perfect acting and a wonderful story. The very film that sparked the modern movie and seems to get better and better with every viewing. Will always be the American magnum opus of its movies.
B00006AW63|1.0|The DVD was formatted for the European region.  I was purchasing it to view in the USA.  So, it wouldn't play on our DVD player.  I saw no way when I ordered to determine that it was form the Europ[ean region.  When I went to the post office to see about sending it back, the return cost was almost the same as the cost of the DVD.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|This is a great story and characters...loved it and would recommend it to anyone that loves a good action book.
B002VECMAO|1.0|Crap with an all star cast.  I was very disappointed with this work.  Not even this ensemble of some of my favorite actors can make this movie watchable.  If there was some way to get a refund, I would be exploring that avenue.  Pure crap.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm a little over half way through the book and I must say that it's not quite what I had expected.  With that said, I am still enjoying it very much.  This book is different than what I am used to reading & I'm finding myself looking forward to my next opportunity to escape & read :) very well written!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Any super hero junkie gets their money worth in this film, and then some.  The cast is fantastic, the action non-stop, and a fitting ending.  What more could you ask for.
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|Purchased this on a lark.  So far (half way through S1) the story stays engaging.<br /><br />The Jessica Lange character is the most compelling so far, but the rest of the cast is very good as well.<br /><br />Interesting ride.
B0064W67IM|4.0|If The Sandman ended here it would be a interesting anomaly with hints of something else. Worth reading yes. But not yet the extraordinary mindblowing work of art it becomes. If horror comics are not really your thing. ( they aren't mine) hold on. That's where Gaiman starts, but even here the stories go far beyond the genre. You need these stories to fully appreciate what comes after. Comics become not only art but literature. Read this then keep going
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Buy it this is fun my little brother loves this game buy it buy it buy don't read this BUY it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fabulous and entertaining TV. Great drama and acting.  The Brits really know how to do a show. Destined to be a classic!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|excellent series can't wait for season 4. The acting is superb, and the scenery is spectacular. it's hard not to find someone to root for. For me it's Mister Bates. Enjoy
B005544TRQ|4.0|Interesting story line, good humor and shockingly all this brought to you from USA. A must watch for all TV buffs.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Amazing book. Only downside was a few grammatical errors which are easily overlooked and hopefully fixed in future novels. Thoroughly captivating story kept me wanting more. Can't wait for the next installment in the series!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this game. It is very additive and challenging.I like the animation  and bright colors. I play it almost every day
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|The free app of the day from the Amazon App Store for August 9, 2013 was Summer Sudoku from 24/7 Games.<br /><br />This Summer Amazon has given us several repeats as the Free App of the Day such as Unolingo and Ninja Chicken.  While this one has never been previously offered for free as part of the Free App of the Day program, it still feels like a repeat.<br /><br />If you have never used a Sudoku app on an Android tablet before, this may be a great app for you.  But if you have played other Sudoku games like Sudoku 10'000 which has been offered as a free app a few times before, this is going to probably be a letdown for you.<br /><br />There are 4 levels in this app: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert.  I found the Easy level was indeed easy and was able to finish a puzzle in that level easily in under 10 minutes.  I found the Expert level was not much harder in comparison.  In the Expert level mode I could easily find and enter numbers that I knew were correct until there are only a few numbers left and you are at the point in the game where it is not very clear where they go such as when you have the numbers 4 and 7 missing in 2 different 3X3 cells.  Your only choice to solve the puzzle is to plug in numbers and hope that you plug them into the right squares so you don't have 2 of the same number in the same row or column.<br /><br />In terms of features, this game has the basic features such as a pencil feature to write down the choices that you think it could be and a few other features you would probably expect to find in most other Sudoku games for Android.<br /><br />But compared to other Sudoku games like Sudoku 10'000, this one is below average.  There are no Sudoku variations in this game and there are much fewer options than a game like Sudoku 10'000.<br /><br />Another problem with this game is that it is rather easy to accidentally get kicked out of the game and lose your progress by pressing the left arrow button at the top of the screen.  If you press that button by accident, the game makes you start over with a new Sudoku puzzle when you start again.<br /><br />As for the Summer theme, the only thing Summer about this app is the red and white flotation device that appears in the app.  There are no other items associated with Summer in this app such as popsicles, rafts, or surfboards.  The Summer theme seems to be used as a gimmick.<br /><br />One nice thing about this app is that the numbers become a little animated when completing the rows or columns or a 3X3 cell.  But that one thing obviously doesn't make up for all the things this game lacks compared to other Sudoku games.<br /><br />Even though I am tempted to give this only 2 stars, I am going to give this 3 stars out of 5 stars since the game is still good for those wanting a basic Sudoku game and they don't care that this game lacks many features found in other Sudoku games for Android.
B00459EZLW|4.0|Very imaginative Sci-Fi.  Keeps you coming back even though some of the episodes leave you disappointed in the immature reactions of Col. Young and Dr. Rush. I also don't appreciate the writers decision to portray a lesbian relationship.  Otherwise, good suspense and action.  I thought Stargate Atlantis was a better production.  Sorry to see both of them go.
B00DB31Y3U|3.0|The Amazon App Store free paid app of the day for August 10, 2013 is Helidroid 3D: Episode 2 from MH Production.<br /><br />This is the latest edition of the Helidroid series of game apps from MH Production available in the Amazon App Store.  The previous two editions were also free apps of the day from Amazon earlier this year.  Even though I have played the original version I haven't had the chance to play the Battle Pro version yet so I can't comment on how that version compares to this one.<br /><br />Like the original version, the graphics are very detailed.  A great example of this is the DVDs on the shelf.  You can actually make out the cover of one of them which looks like The Bourne Identity DVD cover.<br /><br />I was having a very hard time deciding whether to give this 3 stars or 4 stars, but as I played the game it became obvious to me that 3 stars is a better rating for this game based on the following paragraphs.<br /><br />The main problem with this game is that it feels like a copy of the original.  There are no real new concepts that make this game different from the original game which I haven't had the chance to review yet but have played somewhat.  All of the mission objectives such as shooting pop cans and landing on a moving train were in the previous game from what I remember.<br /><br />What this game needs is some new ideas even if it means borrowing from other games.  One game idea would be to copy the classic game Choplifter where you have to control a helicopter and pick up the moving people.  I know that this wasn't meant to be a military game, but this game does have cannons that fire at you so I think it would be reasonable in this type of game to have little people that you have to land near to pick up.<br /><br />Other reasons why I am giving this 3 stars are that it feels impossible to get 3 stars in some missions such as Mission 18 where I was only able to complete the mission with 0 stars after using the desks or tables for coverto fire at the 3 cannons that are constantly firing at you.  Because I have a hard time accurately firing the missiles at the cannons, I always get caught in the crossfire of the other cannons in that Mission.  I should point out that there are only 18 missions in the entire game, and a few of the missions are over rather quickly because they have to be done in less than a minute or you run out of time and you have to start over again.<br /><br />Another minor thing that bothers me about this game is that some Missions require speed like I mentioned above, while some require you to navigate carefully through narrow places which requires you to go more slowly.  But unfortunately there is no way to adjust the chopper's speed to the best of my knowledge.<br /><br />One nice thing about this game that I should point out is that there are very few missions that are locked so you don't have to worry about getting stuck on one mission before you can advance to the next mission in almost every case.<br /><br />So because of the issues above with the main ones being the lack of fresh ideas and a lack of new elements that were not in the original game, I am giving this a 3 stars out of a possible 5 stars rating.
B000H4TX9I|4.0|I enjoyed this as I do most of Joss Wheadon's productions.  Am really disappointed it wasn't finished up in the first season since there won't be anymore after this.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It was good but not as good as the previous two they were much more attention grabbing. I couldn't stop reading the other this one I took a lot of breaks in between.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Not as good as the first two.  Obviously leading into a fourth by the ending that left you hanging.  Will still probably read the next.
B00BP4X3W2|4.0|this movie is a must watch for everybody....all around fantastic movie it had comedy action and drama which everyone can relate too
B0058SNI94|5.0|This is my second pair of Croc flats that I have ordered, so I knew what size to order. They are not made in half sizes, but with experience I knew to order a half size smaller rather than larger. After you wear them a few times they seem to form to your feet.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|yes this product was exactly what we ordered. a DVD  we are missing<br />for the price it was well worth it.<br />thank you
159420411X|4.0|Nate Silver is one of the better writers out there today. He is well versed in things from politics to sports and explains te complicated world of statistics so in a way that anyone can understand. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding why a lot of predictions that we see in the world fail.
0765334798|5.0|John Scalzi does it again with this one. Funny, thought provoking and a real blast to read. As I now do most of my reading in bed late at night, I had a few days of almost no sleep!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Very happy with this app. Does just what I need it to do with frequent buying and selling. Like the notifications.
B004O86JZ4|5.0|Even better in LP: stronger! The Best Foo Fighters album.<br />Hope too listen more of this in the future. :)
B005544TRQ|5.0|makes you think and keeps you wanting to watch the next episode... I would recommend this show,  especially if you like prison break and white collar
B00C061HZY|5.0|Even better in LP. For me, the best Daft Punk album.<br />Hope too listen more of this in the future.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This book left me reeling at the innovative talent of Gillian Flynn. On compleation of the novel I searched what else she had written and immediately downloaded all. Ms Flynn is a writer of immense talent. This is on the edge of your seat reading, I had no idea where it was going, which was very unusual for me as I have a jaded palate for whodunits. This was something else altogether and a fantastic read.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is truly addictive.  Didn't watch season 1 or 2 until watching it on amazon prime.  WOW!! Now I'm hooked, cant't wait till next episodes.  Watching Season 3 as they come out.
B005HP2J66|5.0|A sensitive and unforgettable film about our prehistoric, pre-literate past.  I highly recommend this film.  My only regret is that it is not longer: a bit of footage on how research archaeology believes early man produced the images would have been a nice addition.
B0015F1VY8|5.0|I thought this movie was very enjoyable....one that I will watch again. Cate Blanchett did a very good job as Elizabeth.
0307352153|5.0|I am an introverted teacher.  I am so moved by Mrs. Cain's book that I am suggesting that all administrators and teachers be required to read it.  She accurately reflects my experiences, those of my family and quite a few of my introverted students.  Badly informed extraverts have long dominated American education (as well as business, military and economic policy).  It is time we start extolling the virtues of quiet thoughtfulness.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|Cate Blanchett did an excellent job as Queen Elizabeth. I enjoyed both this and Elizabeth The Golden Years so much that I bought the DVDs so I can watch both again.
1450400957|4.0|While the book had interesting pictures and clearly explained the anatomy of which muscle groups were being worked with which exercises, I was looking more for a guideline of targeted exercises to break up the monotony of my routine. The book was insightful and interesting and would allow beginner to expert gym buff the opportunity to really target a particular group or groups of muscles.
B0076HNMU0|3.0|If you like TV shows that are a little bit strange, Twin Peaks is for you. It's from the 1990's, so be prepared for fluffy hair and shoulder pads. The plot revolves around the murder of a teenage girl, and what happens when an FBI agent comes to a small town in the northeastern U.S. to investigate. The show has a very big cast, many of whom you will recognize from other TV shows of the time, and some who were newcomers.<br />In Season One, we have: murder, adultery, spousal abuse, prostitution, drug importing and distributing, and some weird supernatural happenings. I can't decide if this show is serious or tongue-in-cheek, because the characters have odd mannerisms; for example, the &#34;log lady,&#34; who carries a log around and hardly ever speaks.<br />I can't say that I was riveted to the set while I watched it, but I kept wondering when they would get to the joke!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is as good as it gets.  Your basic game without any stupid story lines or hoops to jump thru.  I love it.
B00BKTFABE|4.0|The best part of this app is it makes the camera accessible from your carousel. Quick and easy! Cheap but the app should be free in my opinion.
B00CY0JY88|5.0|The same sort of start as 50 shades of grey, very good read. Carn't wait until the 4th book in the series comes out
B004F1F32A|5.0|Movie was suspenseful and good action. The HD content was up to standard and with our surround sound made it as though we were in a theater.  I would certainly recommend to others.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|One Republic is amazing.  So happy to have found them. Ryan Tedder is a genius and I look forward to more of their stuff coming out soon.
B007JNWQZS|5.0|I love this combo pack and am so glad to finally own these two movie classics! The movies came on time and the casing was crystal clear, no scratches or anything. I'll be putting it on my movie shelf where it belongs and will definitely shop for more movies on the site :)
B000WMEAKC|4.0|One Republic is a treasure.  I enjoy them so much and can always recognize their music which is such a treat.  Keep it coming guys!
B008D30K7E|5.0|I could not resist this one, I had to read it through to the end though it was tedious at times.<br />really good story. AnneC
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Accurately expresses service members's disdain for the media overall great book on his experience. Helps recognize those heroes who never made it back and couldn't tell the story for themselves.
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|please don't buy the 3d version of this movie it is horrible the worst ever for a 3d movie thanks
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Saw this 3 times in theaters and that wasn't enough...the best movie of the year! By far! The first one was great...but this one blew it out of the water...it was perfect in every way! Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto were outstanding! Benedict Cumberbatch is always flawless and always amazing...he was beyond that in the movie! Heartbreaking, heartwarming, hysterical and all around perfect!
0316228532|4.0|I was never a \\"Harry Potter\\" fan so when I noticed<br />this book I really was not thinking about reading it.<br />A friend suggested it and I bought it.<br />It's a great book.  Ms. Rowling is a great writer.<br />The story is good and the way it's presented is good.<br />She has in my opinion, a masterful talent of using words<br />to describe any situation.  Thoroughly enjoyed the book<br />and thanked my friend for suggesting it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief definitely gives Elie Wiesel's Night some competition! Some students may find Zusak's novel more accessible. I hope I can get a class set for my classroom. I loved it!
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|GREAT MOVIE BOOK<br />This is a wonderful resource for fans of \\"Scarface,\\" Al Pacino, Oliver Stone and Brian De Palma. This author knows an impressive amount about this movie and its players. I really enjoyed this book. It is stimulating, informative and has made me see the movie in a completely new light. Recommended.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini never disappoints! He captures the human qualities in all of us, regardless of where we live. If you loved his last two novels, don't miss this one.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is a fun game but it is kind of hard to operate. Really fun! If you learn the controls it is an awesome game.
B000MR1V22|4.0|The movie is good. Has a lot to do about family values. I don't want to give the movie away...just watch it.
0143039881|4.0|Of all the books that I have read dealing with WWII, I had never read or suspected the role that the Jewish leadership played in cooperating with the Nazis.  According to Hannah Arendt it would have been much more difficult to massacre so many millions of European Jews without their cooperation.  In fact, although I don't remember her writing it, it seems that she intimated that if the leadership had early on said to their people flee or resist, the Nazis would probably have had a more difficult time leading these people to slaughter.  I mean if you are going to die anyway, might as well die resisting in some fashion.  This is well demonstrated by the Jewish state of Israel, which although relatively smaller than many of its enemies, has made it plain in no uncertain terms that it will fight.<br />The book was an eye-opener for me.<br /><br /> C. Sheppard, Dr. AD.
B00E6Z0THE|1.0|This game would be more fun if there were more levels to it, and more of a story. It took me less than a day to complete this game; I don't think it was worth $1.99 and the ending was so anticlimactic. I read the reviews before I purchased this app and so many people said it was great. It's really not that great, not as great as many people have been saying.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|It works and is a color (Red) that I can see from across the room.  Looks like it will last.
B005UG53NS|5.0|I had a great time watching both part one and two with my granddaughter. Part of my summer's bucket list
B005K17RU0|5.0|By far the best weather app. It is user friendly and very accurate. Use this when we travel cross country. Easy to add and delete locations. Try it. It's free.
B005ES1D40|5.0|I got the ones made in Vietnam. They are just as soft as the original Crocs Cayman way back in 2007. The sole seems slightly thicker and more durable. Should be good for a long time.
1400082773|1.0|False advertising on T.V.  It was mostly about white racism and none of the dreams of &#34;His Father&#34;  He called his father the &#34;old man.&#34;
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I found this to be an easy to read, well written book.  The experiments are fun to do and produce results!  For anybody who is interested in bringing positive changes to their lives, I recommend read this book.
1451690215|5.0|The books title gives it all away. This is the magic of reality as opposed to the indoctrination of nonsense many people subject their children to.<br /><br />The book is very good in explaining how these myths came into being and how much more wondrous it is to live in the real world.<br /><br />Please let your children grow up without indoctrination. Feel free to try to do it when they are adults but think about what reaction you might get from a rational adult.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I would recommend this season.  Looking forward to the next.<br />Downton Abbey is very entertaining.<br />It always has something sad going on, and I never can wait for something happy.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|is a wonderful application as it has helped me a lot to develop my knowledge and also is very funny. I recommend to all
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Oz The Great and Powerful is a fun movie overall with plenty of action, adventure, and sights.  The story is good, and if you remember the Wizard of OZ, fits the story nicely.  Unfortunately, you never get a connection with the main characters.
B005GIS1SY|3.0|Thought this would be funnier. Jesse E.'s voice doesn't really lend itself to this type of work. It does have it's moments however. Would have rated 2.5 if allowed to do so.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Full of drama and suspense, and many emotions!  Watching it through amazon prime was my second time through, and it was great!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Odd book. 3.5 stars actually. What really saved it were these brilliant snippets of observation and wisdom sprinkled through the book. And the ending..... it worked for me. I will not read the sequels however.
B000FCK65W|4.0|An old classic.  Very nostalgic and about the way people lived in Brooklyn in the early 1900's and showing the experience of growing up very poor and surviving.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun for all ages and is very creative with all of the different characters, places, and villains.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice was before my time and I only just recently discovered it. It was 1 in the morning and I caught the middle of a marathon of it on TV. After two episodes I knew I had to have it. The characters come alive in the BBC series. While much of the story is sacrificed for the sake of Darcy and Elizabeth in other adaptations of the book, this version gives all the characters the development and screen time they deserve. I've never seen an adaptation as close to the book as this TV version. I wholeheartedly recommend adding this to your collection. It's definitely a classic.
B0031Y9DPU|4.0|This work by Amy Tan tells the stories of Chinese mothers and their children living in the United States.<br /><br />I found it a real eyeopener particularly the successes they had achieved given the difficulties in their early lives.<br /><br />The work was easy to read and really enjoyable.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Purchased Season 1 and Season 2 and just love it.  Ended up watching both seasons in a week!  Wish there were more episodes in each series.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|These batteries in the store are quite expensive but from this seller the price was right and they worked for what I needed.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|I absolutely love this I find almost every song I love its just so amazing the only thing I would change is being able to change the profile picture on the app instead of going to the website I really love it tho
B008133MDK|4.0|I like this series very much, the acting is great, good chemistry.  There is some humor, which I like.. Would recommend.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|Love this movie, is a classic.  I bought this movie for my daughter as a gift at her request.  We enjoy watching it again and again.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|On countless occasions this alarm silenced itself and did not ring at all. It is one of the worse alarm apps out there.
B00BRBIA6C|4.0|If you are looking for a knock down drag out performance then this is not the album for you, though it contains some very pleasing sounds and Agnetha's voice in beautiful along with some luxurious backing. I'm going to enjoy chilling out to this set of songs for some time to come.
B004WIOCUU|5.0|These headphones did not disappoint. They're durable and comfortable. My ears became sore after wearing them for about 3-4 hours. But the same could be said with any over-ear headphones. The sound quality is excellent and the bass kicks nicely.<br />My only issue is that they're not very portable
1451626096|4.0|I LOVE Philippa Gregory historical novels. This novel does not disappoint. Lots of good<br />intrigue in &#34;the house.&#34; Sex, scandals, intrigue, spy masters, beautiful Queen Elizabeth,<br />a member of the York Dynasty, must marry Henry VII a Tudor upstart. Henry's mother,<br />Margaret, who had been Elizabeth's mother's Lady-In-Waiting, when she was Queen<br />and married to Edward of York, is the ultimate in evil, conniving mother-in-law's! Such<br />fun to read!
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Sorry that the series had to end.  Great writing and storyline.  Would like to see a sequel to this series.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Read entire book in a day. Not what i was planning foor my Saturday but couldn't put it down.  Hope to hear more from Ransom Riggs.
B009CWWHFI|4.0|A John Wayne and Mareen O'hera western. What more can a person say? They go together like 2 peas in a pod.
B000QELMF2|4.0|Hi,<br />My daughter order this item and it was a pretty color green.<br />The wings really made this figure stand out. The features look very detailed.<br />The color of her hair brown hair goes very well with her wings and dress.<br />Great Customer service Thank You. Elizabeth Wieder and Tammy Wieder my daughter.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love playing solitaire. This is more enjoyable for me than the regular solitaire. I could play it for hours. It can be more changeling by using more than one suit.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|The movie was in excellent condition and I would recommended to anyone that enjoys suspense. I will watch it over and over
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I've been hooked on this show from the beginning. season 8 just goes to show how successful everyone involved has been. can't wait for season 9
B000UIVRXG|5.0|Great movie. Lots of things to look for, including the foreshadowing of the murders, the humoUr, and other little touches, such as references to what Sgt AngLe has done in gunfights and what actually happens, plus the shortest police chase ever.
B00EE3KMOI|5.0|I've long been a fan of crime drama series as well as many UK dramas - Broadchurch looked like just the type of series I would enjoy.<br /><br />Episode one starts us on our journey with the mysterious death of a young boy and focuses on the various family members and townspeople, each with their own story and relationship with the deceased.  We are also introduced to the detectives on the case, a Detective Inspector who has apparently been recently posted to Broadchurch after some sort of scandal on a previous case, and his subordinate who not only knows the deceased but is already unhappy as she believes that she would be getting the DI job. There is obvious friction there and you wonder if it will hinder the efforts to solve the crime.<br /><br />The death is suspicious, an ambitious local report leaks information in hopes of getting noticed by the \\"big guy\\" and the DI is under scrutiny by the big city reporter who shows up in town and seems set on taking him down for reasons we have yet to learn. You get a real feel that just about everyone could be a suspect and it leaves you wanting to see next weeks episode NOW.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Less soft pr0n than season one, but the characters are delightful and the story lines are interesting. The scenery is gorgeous. It is very three-dimensional. Start with season one and don't look back.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is smart and addictive. The story lines are spot-on and the acting is so believable. Each episode is well written and the actors bring their A-Game to each scene.
B003XDT9BW|5.0|I got it in great condition and I absolutely love it. I got it in great time. Because it's in great condition I would highly recommend it.
B00E5SCOS4|4.0|This is a very pleasant, enjoyable album. Much more acoustic than previous albums. I only gave this four starts as it is not 'as good as it gets'. I'm not sure how to advise people who have been KT Tunstall fans, as this is different from earlier albums. You should expect a more mellow, folk (or acoustic) then her earlier albums.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love this movie! Good humor for adults and for kids. My seven year old can't get enough of it! A+
0765348780|4.0|Prior to reading this book, I had heard a lot about the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, mainly from reviews and it seemed the general consensus was that you either loved it, or you hated it. I am now starting the third installment, Memories of Ice, and still I have not decided my feeling for any of the books. The author writes in a style that can sometimes be simply unpleasant to read, yet he is able to keep things moving by adding layer upon layer of details and surprises, in a very unique way. For some people, just reading the first 40 or 50 pages of Gardens of the Moon is enough to decide whether they feel comfortable with the author's unique style of prose and plot. It may be off-putting, or so different that you can't help but be curious. However, as I read this series, my opinions change by the chapter. Sometimes I hate the way that it is written and cannot believe it is worth being published, yet the next time the viewpoint changes, I am once again enamored by the complex world that Erikson has created. This book and its sequels are not for impatient people with little time; they are for readers that are willing to try out a whole different type of novel- one that doesn't care about the reader, and one that doesn't care if they hate it, love it, or can't decide.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|Got this for the granddaughter - love the story myself.  Hope there are more stories out there from these folks.
B000IKQMFO|5.0|If you enjoyed Downton Abbey, you will enjoy Gosford Park. Well acted, well played and you don't really know who did it until the very end! You might think you do, but you'll be wrong.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose a 5 star rating because it is an amazing book. You never want to put it down. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the best 3d puzzles I have played.  Wish it was longer.  I look forward to solving the next puzzle.
B000NQRE9Q|1.0|This review is primarily for the blu ray set, not the actual movies. The only reason why I gave even one star s is the fact the blu ray quality is great, so much better than the last DVD set released. I am so disappointed in the fact this set is manufactured in a cheap, paper and cardboard case. The discs are extremely hard to get out of the cardboard sleeves. This is a disgrace that Lucas did not spend the time and extra care to package correctly in some sort of collector plastic case, rather than the cheap and low class cardboard and paper.  Since the only way to get these movies on bluray, it is probably best to get this set as I have heard it might be a while, or never, they can be obtained otherwise. I was so anxious to receive and probably missed other reviews talking about the inferior packaging. The price was ok, but just a huge disappointment with the packaging.
B009PAETCG|4.0|My 3yr old loves sports, but this game is a little hard for him.  He gives up because he can't hit the target.  We'll give him some time and see if he improves.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|I was going to write a longer review, but the one in the Guardian pretty much reflects my opinion far more eloquently than anything I could set down.  [...]    Aslan has a compelling writing style but is at best a third rate academician.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I liked the way the relationships between the charactors evolved. I felt in was well written and did get the next book in this series.
B005544TRQ|5.0|fascinating; with drama and some ugly legal issues; I hope this a gross exaggeration of the law; but very entertatining
B002VECM6S|5.0|I first saw this movie at a Saturday movie night at the university I work at, (The weekend just before it's dabute to DVD) I cheered at the very end of the movie, I wanted my family to see it so bad. The next weekend after that Saturday night I first saw this movie I raced down to Blockbuster(This was before it had gone out of business)right after I had gotten off work to rent \\"Old Dogs\\". But all their copies of that movie were all rented out, So I picked up this movie. I came racing out of Blockbuster with a rented DVD copy of \\"The Blind Side\\" and said to parents, \\"All of the copies of \\"Old Dogs\\" have been rented out, So I got \\"The Blind Side\\". My mom and dad said they really liked it, I think this is a wonderful movie for the whole family. However, there is one scene in this movie that may be inappropriate for young children. All in all, A Great Movie!!! I am glad that I added it to my DVD collection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith
0345803507|5.0|I loved this book, I just wish it wasn't the end! The story is like a more realistic Twilight but nevertheless, addicting.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|I think this movie must have been a flop at the box office because I didn't remember seeing any previews for it when it was playing at the movies. In my opinion, it was a great movie. Yes, I know it is a chick flick and I am a guy, but still, this movie is one of my guilty pleasures. I especially like the part in the movie when Josh and Julianne are dancing to the song, \\"Heart's Content\\". It reminded me of the part in the movie \\"Witness\\" when Harrison Ford as John Book, and Kelly McGiliss as Rachel Lapp were dancing to the song, \\"Wonderful World\\". I am so glad I bought this movie on DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My children love this game. I can't believe that it is free and how amazing it is.  My daughter enjoys spending her time on this game.
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|I loved the original \\"Evil Dead.\\" The original is one of the best horror films in the last 30 years. But this remake is a total waste of time, film and money. It's not scary. Not scary in the least. The blood & gore is just gross and overly done. I didn't care about any of the characters. I was bored, bored, bored. I love scary movies but I really hated this film and I regret that I paid to watch it. The original remains a classic.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Easy to use bigger screen to look on and a great way to communicate with friends and know whats happening in the world
B00AEFY6ZQ|5.0|Bought this only because our other DVD was getting scratched. Three daughters under 18 have worn it out. Love the antics, accents, wildlife, and subtle one liners.
B000HF2NTE|4.0|Good movie I did like it I am doing this for min words requd for amaz I don't like this way I will not rate any other movies
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I liked it but it went on and on.  I wanted a little more meat. I will get the next one.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|One of the most entertaining games I've played in a blue moon. You will play this game for hours on end. I'm happy to selected this game. Good times.
B008AVXGA2|5.0|I found myself transported happily back to the idyllic days of my childhood as I read this book. Julia has a way of making magic birds and mythical creatures spring to life in vivid technicolour. As a young reader, I spent many a happy hour engrossed in the fairy tales of the brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Anderson. Julia has the same way of capturing the imagination with this beautiful retelling of an old Russian folktale in a style that will captivate the modern, young reader.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|So wonderful. I really enjoy the graphics &amp; sound effects. I also likr the fact that you can play with your friends online. Thanks for the new version.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This game is very addictive! I like creating beats.  I wish there were more instructions though, but even without them the game is very cool.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|Not nearly as well written as the Robert Langdon books or even his other efforts but entertaining all the same.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game is very addictive!  I stared playing it and I didn't stop until 33 levels later.  Simple graphics, but a lot of fun.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|It was interesting because the premise was that the doctor was manipulating the patient, and it turned out the patient was manipulating the doctor.  Great because, at least I didn't realize, that it was such a game of chess.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I recently downloaded the weather program because I travel a lot and need to be updated on weather issues. This is a great program for the kindle fire. I use it all the time. Very accurate and easy to navigate. I would definitely recommend this app to everyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have been playing this game like a month and its pretty cool. I am still trying to figure out how to make lots of money on here though.
B005FVNIW6|4.0|I was surprised by how much i like this. It's actually a story of child cruelty. it's amazing how much one identifies with Ender.<br />I'll leave the sequels alone i think.
B00992CF6W|5.0|one word. EPIC!!! gets better with every update. awesome. GET IT! I love it. there are too many cool things to list!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I had trouble with my yahoo mail getting on my tablet from a search engine and it was very hard to use.  But when I found this and downloaded it onto my tablet I absolutely loved it.  So easy to choose mail and delete or move to a specific folder.  Took me a minute to figure out how to send mail but once I found it it was easy.  This is great for everyone that has yahoo mail.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|Our family has always been a fan of the Star Trek series, be it The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine or Voyager!  We have watched the complete series of all 3, many times and always come back for more.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|It is very satisfying to see &#34;older&#34; actors cast in action roles.  This troupe added a bit of love interest and humor to the overall feeling of the movie.
B00A31UXLW|3.0|The context of the story was acceptable if a little forced but the author lost it in the end when the hero acted outside sensible rules and was recued by his hitherto enemy without adequate explanation as to how she got to arrive in the nick of time. I thought the last half of the novel highly improbable and I am a Connelly fan.
0783244320|4.0|Tim Allen,  Segourney Weaver et al, really pulled off this spoof of Star Trek.  It was heart warming with a message.
B00821OX98|5.0|This series is as good or better than Walking Dead. Very impressed with the content and quality of the series.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|I never saw so much blood,  fountains, spurting and spraying. Kids will love it but as an adult, I thought it foolish. The story line was ridiculous and completely unrealistic, ignoring history entirely. Even with it's many flaws, I watched the whole thing anyway. I think the main characters were engaging which is why I gave it an OK rating. Other than that, it's pretty awful.
B00DURGZHW|5.0|Have waited to see this movie since I saw the trailer for it before it came out at the theaters. I don't go to them I wait and watch on demand or dvd ,this was well worth the wait! Best movie I have seen all year, maybe for 2 years! It is a must see.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I can just say .....<br />BEST BOOK EVER i have to read it for my summer homework and it was awesome
B00000DNCF|5.0|I actually already own this CD but purchased this used special edition because of the additional music on the bonus CD. The CD's are incredible and as a huge Soundgarden fan, I am so happy that the used CD's were in very good condition. Very satisfied with this purchase.
B005898DDO|5.0|If you're a Dylan fan, you'll want to watch this repeatedly. Filmed during a 1960s tour of England, 20 something Bob Dylan is a genius in the making. Live concert footage, partying in a hotel room with Donovan, et. al An amazing, intimate view of one of the premier troubadours of our time.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started using this video in June and decided to work-out Monday through Friday every week. I started on Level 1 which was hard - but not anything I couldn't do. I was a little sore the first few days but nothing awful. I did Level 1 for 11 workouts then moved to Level 2. It was more challenging and I found that after 11 workouts at this level I was definitely ready to move on to Level 3. I absolutely LOVE Level 3! It is very challenging but I can tell that I am definitely getting much stronger in my upper body. I can do actual full-blown push-ups now! Never before in my life have I been able to do that! (And I am 47 yrs old!) I also noticed that the muscle I had been losing in my quads - was now returning. I feel so much more toned and stronger than I ever have. Thanks Jillian for a great workout! Now I have to find another of her DVDs to try!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|its worth it.. been looking for a good game thats not super short or taked 30mins to unlock everything and this is it if u have ever played LoL and looking for a game on the kindle like it then this game is it
B00CIS1OKW|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Thought it would be a real drain of time, but it was actually pretty good. The giants were ruthless and Jack, the hero, had me rooting for him all the way.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|i really liked it a lot, a lot of back and forth action, keeps you guessing. would recommend for other people
B003Z0D4SM|4.0|As others have mentioned this book is slow off the mark; but eventually, maybe 30% of the way in (I'm reading the kindle edition so there are no page numbers),  we reach cruising speed at last.  Then it comes into its own as a really first-class thriller and the kind of book one doesn't want to put down.  My advice: it pays to persevere!<br /><br />At times, the language of the English translation is a bit too goose-steppingly wooden,  but one gets over that in short order.<br /><br />Some readers objected to the author's including a few menus for snacks enjoyed by the protagonists.  For my part, I found that of interest, and have adopted one of them for my own repertoire: marinated herring, sour cream or tadziki and chives, bread, beer.  Quick and nutritious. Thanks, Stieg!<br /><br />For truly boring, endless and perfectly irrelevant menu descriptions, one cannot beat the ones saddled  upon the reader in the appalling books #4 & 5 of the medieval saga _Game_of_Thrones_ by George R. R. Martin.  In comparison, Mr. Larsson is countless light years above that.<br /><br />Happy reading!
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|The storyline wasn't interesting and didn't catch my attention. I was expecting more from this movie and was kid of disappointed.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|The game is challenging intellectually. Also, it doesn't have huge leaps in challenge from one level to the next. It really does take you gently from three steps to ...whatever number of steps were in level 44. If I had a complaint, it would be that I wish that there were more levels.
B009GN6DT4|5.0|Great classic movie. the quality of the movie was great. My 5 year old son liked it, although he seemed a bit frightened of the story plot at the start.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have to admit, I was a little reluctant to read it at first, from what I heard about it, it was about killing for entertainment, but it made you want to keep reading at the end of every chapter. It would always keep you on the edge of your seat, and is overall a great read.
B000I2JI80|4.0|I prefer it to the Portra 400 for landscape and general purpose subject matter.  The Superia also from Fuji seems a little more pastel, the 400H more saturated.  General problems at the 400 ISO range for color film these days!<br /><br />Fwiw: much better with Rolliflex than Mamiya 6 and RZ.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I received my first kindle from my son as a Christmas gift two or three years ago.  I thought, what's this thing. I'm<br />supposed to read books on this instead of getting a book off the bookshelf? That will never happen.  That is one of the many things I have been wrong about in my 87 years.  I got to liking that little kindle so much that I purchased two kindle fires.  One to keep here at home and one to keep at my son's home.  I am going to purchase a paper white soon.<br />I read every night in bed for long periods of time.  My small kindle doesn't have a back light so I believe the paper white<br />will serve me better.  I am thankful to be the owner of kindles, and I am thankful for a son who insists that I at least try new things.  Try a kindle you may end up loving it as I do,
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|this is great you can zero in on any music you like its just like putting your life random play
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I really enjoyed this.  I found it light hearted, interesting and unexpected - well worth spending a few hours on.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My family and I all really enjoyed solving the puzzles to escape. I can't wait for more levels. Don't start it if you have a &quot;to-do&quot; list because you can easily become oblivious to the time passing!
B000HL09SA|4.0|A heartwarming tale.  And at one point a bit of a tear jerker.  The characters are not especially deep, but you still find yourself caring about them, especially Skip!  :)
B00007LTIB|4.0|RELAYER...Debut in 1974. I remember seeing this tour. True this was the only album Patrick Moraz ever played on. But he was at his game on this album. Gates Of Delirium is 20 plus minutes of fine dark and genius musicianship. Sound Chaser an eerie rock masterpiece with some of the best work Steve Howe and Alan White have ever done.And my personal favorite>>>To Be Over..is by far the best track on this album. Filled with brilliant vocals by Jon Anderson. Phenominal bass by Chris Squire. And some of the best instrumentation of music ...I have ever heard in my life. It is haunting,bewitching,a tearful mindset of wisdom. It will blow you right out of the water.
B0052OSTOS|3.0|The voice is calming but it hasn't helped me get to sleep. I'm going to keep trying to see if perhaps I need to train my mind to work with it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Here is the PROBLEM, I purchased Usain Bolt. I can not downloaded him on my Android.  No other problems with the game.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I do like the choices of sounds and find them relaxing, although I'm not convinced the underlying 'hertz' really helps with anything.
B008602KQI|5.0|I enjoyed the book tremendously and the movie is a bit short on explanations but if you read the book you will love the action.
1400069807|5.0|I've read several books on this topic and keep up with related research. This is easily the best book I've encountered so far when it comes to addressing the food environment in the United States and the effects of fat, salt, and sugar on our brains and bodies. Moss did an excellent job of discussing these issues from all perspectives and wrapped up with realistic and useful suggestions for addressing our problems. Two thumbs up for this excellent book!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My 4 year old son plays this all the time! He loves the music and dances to it.  He also loves the game! Great app!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Don't read this series if you have problems with depression. There is nothing uplifting in this series and really highlights the worst attributes of the human race. The heroine spends a lot of time in very deep depression and unable to function in any way.  That being said, it is a great unpredictable story with no pretty tied up in a bow endings.  I read all three books in five days and that is only because I had stuff to do and was forced to put it down.  It is a page turner.  It also has a great depiction of both PTSD and depression and what those illnesses can do to someone if untreated.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Some cool scenes in this movie, but overall what this movie is trying to accomplish was not done delicately enough to not confuse you. I lost interest pretty quickly.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|Bought this because of the generally positive reviews, but I am totally disgusted with it!<br />1. The negatives are WAY to light when \\"scanned\\" with this device. I had to adjust the Exposure Value 2 full stops to the left to be able to see the image on the negatives. I could live with this but....<br />2. The instruction book is full of mistakes. It tells you to press the ENTER button when it actually means the Scan/Home button and vice versa (example on page 21). Not always, but you don't know when it is right or wrong until you try it! I could get by with this, after I learn what is right and what is wrong, but....<br />3. The cheap plastic film guides are USELESS! Another reviewer stated that it took 500 or so negatives before the scratches were noticeable, but after only scanning 4 strips of 4 negatives the film guide was so scratched that I could no longer use it. At this rate, it would be cheaper to pay someone else to scan the negatives! I bought extra film guides, as suggested, but if they wear out this fast - forget it! I thought my negatives had scratches, but then I looked closer and all the scratches were in the same place! I looked at the film guide and saw that it had many scratches on it! Can't live with this!<br />4. Definitely will be returning it!
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I have tried reading this book again and again.  I just couldn't get through it due to the soul crushing nature of the story.  I'm not even a very emotional woman.  I seriously never cry, but this book just destroys me.  If you are a naturally emotionally reactive person, you might just want to ask a friend for a synopsis and save yourself the heartache.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The 4th season is being anticipated eagerly.  Now I see why others have been raving about the show.  It was great to see all 3 episodes together so you can really get to know the characters.
B009AMANBA|4.0|This film showed aspects of Lincoln that I never knew.  It is superbly directed, and Daniel Day-Lewis gives a wonderful performance.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun but needs to have more levels it is over far too quickly. I also wish some of the rooms were bigger.
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|Love & Other Drugs - I thought it was a cute entertaining moive.  Would watch it again on a gloomy day.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My daughter has been having a blast playing this game all day long. It certainly keeps her occupied. Thank you
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Les Miserables was a very powerful.  I saw the play 30 years ago - the moive kept to the script and had my attention the entire.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|downloaded it for my daughter then became addicted. would recommend it to anyone. just don't waste money on coins and acorns.
B00CJGP116|5.0|I happen to love Marc Anthony's music.  Long-awaited.  If you are a Marc Anthony fan, you will love this CD.
B009DH372Y|5.0|You could quibble with the arrangements and longer set list of Live at Wembley, but for quality, energy, and capturing the band, this is the one.  The video, audio and overall production is excellent.  The Hungarian crew made this so good it looks and sounds more like 2006 than 1986.  Freddie's voice this night is ON.  Less self indulgent than Milton Keyes. It's a band giving to it's audience.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Everyone one was singing and making videos of this song all summer long. Very catchy tune that sticks in your head.
B00DAXXO98|3.0|I started watching this show and stopped after a few episodes. It is boring and not original IN ANY WAY. I am surprised that the show is nominated to so many Emmy awards..
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Was looking for a thin protective cover for. a while.  Finally found it and it works great. No falling off or struggling to get it open. Nice product.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This DVD relates to matters that are important to in this modern time of medical expenses.  It is well documented and presented.<br />The DVD was delivered on time and well packaged.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much!!!!!!! It's kinda like subway surfers and temple run mixed together only better and with minions!!!
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|This was a very cool book, with a nice sci-fi and supernatural combo. The characters are great and the pace is good too, with shorter chapters to make you feel like you're making progress, and easier to put down at night when it's way past your bedtime. Look out though, the end is a cliff-hanger and you won't be able to stop there, you'll HAVE to go on to read Outin. Hang on tight it's a kick-butt ride!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This is one of the best games I've ever played! It's has great game play. everyone should play this game app.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This book is unforgettable; it hurts to read this story.  How could the lives of two teenagers who have &#34;everything&#34; end up so tragically?  The author presents the story with so much detail that the reader is drawn into their agonizing decision that ends the young girl's life.  Could this situation really happen?  I suppose in this day and age of unbelievable occurrences, it could (and possibly has).  Could parents be so blind as to not see the depression and fear in their children?  Because the families were so close in all the years their children were growing up, did the parents not even for a moment notice the extreme closeness was too much for their children to withstand?  The daughter was very smart; couldn't she (or wouldn't she) make an effort to get out of the trap she was in without ending her life?<br /><br />Be it as it may, the story was heartbreaking and very well written in the descriptions of the parents and their reactions to the tragedy and the son who helped the daughter end her life.  The arrest of the son, and his incarceration were well depicted.  The courtroom scenes, of course, were spellbinding.  For any parent or child who might have to live through an experience of this import, I hope you have a god who will be standing next to you to help you stay strong.
B00ABJWQXO|5.0|does basically what i wanted it to. keeps the glass off of the table or whatever i'm sitting it on and keeps a close to stock look to the phone.
0425263924|1.0|Entwined with You is the third book in the Crossfire series by Sylvia Day. Although the book begins exactly where Reflected in You ends, not much happens. We don't find out the demons in Gideon's past. Their relationship barely grows. The erotic scene overload doesn't cover the fact that there is no plot.<br /><br />When a book is highly anticipated, I expect the author to bring it. When a book's expected publishing date is delayed (by months), I expect a polished plot. I don't expect a lackluster half-ass effort. I have looked forward to reading Entwined with You for about a year. Silly of me to assume the author would take advantage of the extra time between release dates and reread, rewrite, revise and improve the story. The Crossfire series was originally a trilogy. But Entwined with You was nothing but a filler. I cringe at the thought this is how the story of Gideon and Eva would've ended.<br /><br />The worldwide phenomenon of Crossfire has fizzled. What used to be my favorite dysfunctional couple has now fell down the totem pole. I'm not even excited that the series has been extended to include two more books. Instead I feel like the author is exploiting fans by drawing this series out. It doesn't need five books, ESPECIALLY after this...this...disappointing installment. Yes, I am interested and will tune in to the TV series pilot but only because I am curious to see Eva and Gideon's story unfold on screen.<br /><br />I'm just really, really disappointed with Sylvia Day (because she's a good writer despite this flop) and Entwined with You. I feel like a teacher who knows one of their star students' capabilities but they fail a research paper. Really, Sylvia?! You're a New York Times bestselling author. I KNOW you could have done better.<br /><br />Literary Marie of Precision Reviews
B0025KVLSI|5.0|Already had the cd but needed to replace it in my collection because it kept running away and winding up in my son's room , so now we both have a copy and this one seems to be satisfied staying in my collection. Everyone should have a Beatles collection to go to for those times when you feel nostalgic, especially on cold rainy days when you have to stay inside.
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|great classic feel good movie - loved this when i was a kid and its a underdog winner story<br /><br />how about part 2 ?
0486268659|5.0|Well, I now know why every production of A Christmas Carol is virtually the same. They are taken verbatim from this book.<br />I bought this to get me in the holiday spirit and was not disappointed. It is a quick read and very enjoyable.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|This is one History movie I will watch always without any reservations. If you want to know how Lincoln managed his administration and the emancipation proclamation, this is a movie you should not miss. Go get it!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is the best collection out there.  Literally the only complaint that I have is the way the discs are in sleeves which to me seems like it's just begging to scratch them up after multiple viewings.
B00111KDBS|5.0|I bought a pair of these a while back and loved them so much i just bought two more pair in different colors. I have gotten many compliments on the style but the main reason I bought them is that i had an ankle surgery and need comfort and strong support - I get both from these boots. I enthusiastically recommend them.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Love it or hate it, I can appreciate that this movie isn't afraid to touch on sensitive subjects and while having you hate where it's at you end up loving how it ends.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am unable to put this game down. LiteRally it has kept me awake, trying to figure it out. Really makes you use your noodle.

B00CLF80O0|1.0|Here is the opinion of a huge Whitesnake fan, someone who has seen them live before, someone who owns ALL the albums; hair-band era, original UK era and Doug Aldrich era.  I really wanted this album to be good, especially after the disappointing Made In Japan, released around six months ago.  This new live album is just as bad, probably worse.  The guitars are all tuned down to D to accomodate DC's voice live.  It's not *that* noticeable in a live setting, but it's REALLY noticeable listening to a live album.  Tunes like Bad Boys and Fool For Your Lovin are almost unrecognisable because of the downtuning, they just don't sound right.  The lead vocals are 100% overdubbed and they STILL don't sound any good.  The setlist on the Britain disc is, with the exception of one or two songs, exactly what was on Made In Japan, in the same order.  The stuff on the second disc is, with one or two exceptions, all stuff that was already on the Live in the Still of the Night DVD/Live in the Shadow of the Blues album.  Exceptions are Slide It In and a full band version of The Deeper The Love, from memory there was an acoustic version of it on Live in the Shadow of the Blues (and the 2 disc double edition of Good to be Bad). Honestly, this is just sad. Coverdale is one of my heroes, but it's time for him to either give it up, or just stick to doing new Whitesnake STUDIO albums occasionally - the last two studio albums have been really good.  He just can't handle it live anymore, and there is certainly NO reason to document their recent live shows with a live album, let alone THREE DISCS of live material released in the space of six months. I suggest you save your money and invest in the brilliant Live in the Still of the Night DVD and the Live in the Shadow of the Blues 2CD set from around five years ago, they're VASTLY superior to this disappointing release.  GET SOME DECENT MANAGEMENT PLEASE COVERDALE!  You're not doing yourself any favours.
B005UG542S|4.0|First time renting a movie from Amazon. Cheap, easy, and very good streaming quality. My daughters completely fangirled. Certainly won't be the last from Amazon. My daughter completely fangirled. Thx for making me look like a hero.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|I was excited about this movie because the animation seemed brilliant and cutting-edge & Scottish culture is very colorful & interesting-- so I bought it in HD for $20.  The visuals & computer graphics did not disappoint-- Walt Disney would be awestruck and ecstatic if he could see what the industry can do these days--No doubt. But I believe he would have had the writers work on the storyline a bit more before releasing this to the public.  It was a nice idea -- I'm sure that every mother & daughter would be able to recognize themselves in this tale of Merida and her queen mom-with-nagging-high-expectations.  And, yes, when rifts and disagreements occur as a result of youthful pride and stubborn ego a mother figure can become, at least in the eyes of her daughter, a scary giant bear--who can be threatening & monstrous towards her girl --as well as more protective of her baby than any other natural force in the living world--- I completely get the metaphor and it had so much potential to resonate more with people than it actually did.  But somehow, the metaphor in its beginning is strained and carries little momentum.  There seem to be few apparent parallels between the Queen and her enchanted persona.  Perhaps this could have been fixed by making her more \\"bear-like\\" before the transformation-but it would be difficult to do this and still have her be likable.  So as it stands for most of the film, there is very little to make us believe that the Queen is really inside of this bear-and it's somewhat horrifying to think that her husband is getting ready to slay his wife b/c of mistaken identity.  The story is redeemed in the one scene when Merida believes that she has failed to break the spell that holds her mother captive.  She waits for the bear to transform back to her mother -and she is crushed when it does not occur as she had hoped.  She is humbled and can only hopelessly cling to her mother's side -wishing her back to who she once was.  This scene was masterfully done and rightfully brings the audience to tears.  Almost as fulfilling as the classic scene from \\"Dumbo\\" where his mother reaches thru the bars of the carnival cage with her trunk to be with him as much as she is able to.  C'mon Disney-Pixar -- don't be distracted/overwhelmed by your own visuals-- make sure the story is refined and fleshed out as much as possible before takeoff.
B008XKT9FG|4.0|Believe in love at first sight? I do! I married my love at first sight almost 51 years ago.<br /><br />Believe in lust at first sight? I do because I have met a lot of men and a few women who seemed to search for it.<br /><br />The plot was an interesting mix of both!
B001NCKPV8|5.0|I've recently become very bored with new popular music. This throwback gave me a much needed dose if Awsomeness!  I saw a documentary about the drummer and loved the psychedelic sound!
B00632HWOG|5.0|allows for one touch access to yahoo email. Very convenient. One of my most used apps. I highly recommend it.
B00D37UP4S|5.0|Read the book numerous times even seen the movie a hand full of times in theater and couldn't say how many on video.... Daily repeats gotta love some Ian and Jared <3
B006C45CFG|4.0|I guess i expected more because of Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig leading the cast.  It was very goodbut not great.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Slydris is a match game in the same vein as  Tetris but when you mess up, you can fix it. Multiple levels and ways to play make it fun.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|A fun and entertaining read.  Loved the premise of the plot and writing style was engaging and fluid.  Alot of fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is superb programming and Season 3 was no exception. So far each season has hit the mark without missing a beat with an engaging and well-written storyline.  The acting is of the highest quality--and not just the well known actors, but even those in less prominent roles. Absolutely love this show!
B0002XMKYE|4.0|General Patton was one of the most controversial generals in World War Two. George C. Scott plays him very convincingly.
B00E00P5JC|4.0|I went into this movie with zero expectations, and hoping that Ryan Reynolds wasn't going to be embarrassed too badly by Dreamworks Animation Studios. I was pleasantly surprised. Turbo turns out to be like most Dreamworks cartoons; entertaining for the kids without playing down to them, while still giving the adults a few things to chuckle at.<br /><br />Unlike most Dreamworks films, or most films at all actually, Turbo spends most of the film without a primary antagonist, and hence, without a deeper purpose. As a garden snail, he spends all day at his job at \\"The Plant\\" dreaming of racing. After work, he spends all night watching race cars and idolizing Guy Gagne, one of the top racers in Formula 1 (and, possibly a reference to Jean Girard of Talladega Nights, who is also a French racer who dominated F1 before taking over NASCAR).<br /><br />Without a real antagonist, Turbo is held down to earth by his brother, Chet (Paul Giamatti), who supervises him at work and tries to keep him rooted. When an accident at The Plant costs them both their jobs, Turbo \\"runs\\" away from home, and accidentally finds himself at the start of an underground race as a hood ornament. Yet another accident swoops him up into the engine of one of the cars just as the driver switches on the nitrous oxide, altering his DNA and turning him from a common garden snail into the fastest creature on no legs.<br /><br />So we've got a story. Now, onto the cast. Several other snails make appearances in the film. Whiplash is portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson, doing what Samuel L. Jackson does best: saying common sense things with a raised voice so they're funny. Snoop Dogg lends his voice to Smoove Moove, a thin, wiry snail who wears fuzzy dice around his neck. Michael Bell appears, and then disappears, as the White Shadow, a snail whose name is also his catchphrase. Maya Rudolph and Ben Schwartz round out the Starlight Snail Crew as Burn, a female snail who has a thing for Chet, and Skidmark, Whiplash's \\"feisty #2.\\" Michael Peña and Luis Guzmán appear as the Lopez brothers, proprietors of the struggling taco stand Dos Bros. Tacos, who both have different ideas to revive it and mimic Turbo and Chet's relationship very closely.<br /><br />In spite of its lack of a villain for a good hour and twenty minutes, Turbo manages to do what it sets out to do: give kids and adults alike a little laugh and a little distraction. It also gives a hefty bit of inspiration in the form of Guy Gagne who delivers a quote from his father: \\"No dream is too big, and no dreamer too small.\\"
B00005N5S2|4.0|Gregory Peck plays General MacArthur in a very realistic and convincing manner. The movie is very entertaining and most interesting.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|After a while, tubemate stopped working and would freeze and shut down my Kindle! Careful peoples! I have also only had this app for less than a week! Seriously!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I couldn't stop laughing the whole time!  Tina Fey is my favorite writer from her days on SNL to her movies.
B00005NTJK|5.0|Excellent album! My dad had lost his so I ordered him another CD and he says this one even has additional tracks he didn't have before:)
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Great show, great actors. Each episode is like a movie all on its own. Great to watch with a girlfriend that loves mysteries. I just wish the seasons were longer.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I LIke this game because  the maps change so its never boring. This game is grate to have but sometimes,it get pretty hard but its worth it.I do wish it had more too it like u can race your friends i think that would be cool. ITS AN AWSOME ATTION KEEPING GAME!!
B005LW5J9O|3.0|while this book is a good read, I must say that the vast majority of the author's time is spent in developing the history of ancient texts and the pursuit of those text rather than the facts surrounding the fact that in antiquity, the ancient Greek and Romans and philosophized about atoms and the &#34;Nature of Things&#34;.  Good read but its less about fact and more about the search for ancient books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Yes just yes. Play this on a trip to pass the time hours of fun. So worth the $0.00 it cost
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Lovely 70's and 80's vibe that flows so naturally with the newly live instrumentation by Daft Punk and collaborators. Definitely worth at least 3 listens! Of course, I'm guaranteed to listen to it for the rest of my life ;)!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is awesome. It is really exciting to play. For sure it's the best $2.99 I spent recently. Keep soaring . . .
B009QU9X44|5.0|This writer shines a light on many issues to do with race, the remnants of a colonial past, desperation of youth to become established and then deal with what they have become. i loved this book, loved the many avenues it took me down and revelations it provided. My congratulations to the author for another dazzling book.
B009R8DHAQ|5.0|I love this book. Greg reminds me of some of the boys I teach. Crazy but real and likable. I'm not sure who is crazier though, the father or the older brother.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Haven't finished it yet, but I can't put it down. Are these dragons ever going to find a home ???
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish. I'd been intrigued by Kaleb when he played a roll in other books in the series and secretly hoping his 'story' would be told. I couldn't put it down and read the whole thing in two days. I found the storyline to be riveting. I LOVED the characters. It felt like an ending to the series and I really, REALLY hope to learn that I'm wrong.
1451668945|4.0|m.h.clark is a queen for suspence.......its full of  suspence.... she a great writer any book she writes I would bhuy it
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|The game itself is fun but it takes so long to get to the animals you need to fill in the booths.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's okay it will not let me connect to Facebook. Please fix this problem for Kindle fire HD other than this really good for little kids.
B00C7O8MJ8|2.0|Despite the great effect of the soundtrack during the movie, the orchetrated promenades seems to be a little bit out of purpose when they are listened out of that context. It is not a &#34;2001&#34; kind of classic soundtrack.
B0002HYHSW|5.0|We've played this game with adults and children.  Game goes very fast and its loads of fun to play!  Only problem is sometimes the die rolls into the sticks.  Still lots of fun to play!  Keep it Steady is similar to pick up stix  but goes much faster.
B00000ILGL|5.0|The art of a genious, depicted in a great dance music  record. The father of electronic music opening the path to reach the future of music!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|A truly great read!  I couldn't put this book down from the moment I picked it up.  Called out of work just to finish
1781162646|4.0|Liked it. Good read, was able to bring me into that time period which is what I expect from King. Would buy it!
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|I got through the tutorial then I put in my gameloft live profile and password and it registered it but then it said no network connection so I checked my internet and it said it had 5 bars so I tried it again and it did the same thing so I shut down my kindle fire and tried it again but I did the same thing so I uninstalled it and reinstall ed it and tried it again but it said thing so I deleted it.
B001THZAAI|3.0|I watched this on a plane flying to France. I had to watch my laughing so as not to disturb fellow passengers. But it was great. So I bought it upon my return.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it does have a lot of swearing, which wasn't evident on the plane. If you don't mind a lot of swearing including the F-word, then get it. If that bothers you, take a pass. Had I known that, I would have.<br /><br />Other than that, it is hilarious. I lived in the Nord de la France, so it brought back memories as it describes life there.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|Once you figure the game out completely, its wicked fun! The levels get harder and harder. Reminds me of space invaders
B009WUBERW|4.0|There is more story ... and a whole gaggle of old action stars ... just my age.  I love them when we were all young and beautiful and I love them now that we aren't.  They kick everybody's butt and entertain me while they are doing it.  Who could ask for more than that?  It's not great drama, but it is great theater!!!  =)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These are books for all ages.  I can't wait until the movies come out for the last two books to see how Hollywood puts on the screen what Collins put into the written word.  I will be disappointed if they do not stick to the book.
B003LPNGWA|5.0|Although low keyed this is a charming story with a great cast and it is great for all book lovers.
078322804X|1.0|i ordered 3 items and received this movie only.<br /> the case was broken!<br />downloading or ripping was not the option i wanted
B004SBS8LA|5.0|love the game and love the graphics. Easier to play than Angry birds space and angry birds star wars. Go for it
0679819401|5.0|Happy with my purchase! Write up on product was spot on.  I bought it for a gift and cannot wait to give it!
B002QCD2QO|5.0|This film is from another time, when scary movies could take some time to build suspense. Today it's opening credits then out comes the sawzall and the pliers. Wicker Man builds over time, becoming more bizarre and creepy up to the finale. If you like some of the music, check out the cover of &#34;Willow's Song&#34; by Seafood (2002?)
B005MJFA2W|5.0|A must read for anyone who considers themselves to be an intelligent and logical thinker. Make sure you have a pen and paper ready as the concepts and information come thick and fast. I suspect that this book contains more interesting info than most university courses and is about as valuable.
B001BR7CZW|2.0|I'm so old I saw this during its original theatrical release. Seeing it again, I was struck by the cut and paste quality of the script and by how Belushi and Ackroyd seemed to be just going through the SNL routine. There are some classic pop culture moments (The Penguin, etc.) but I was not very impressed. James Brown was pretty real, but the other musical numbers seemed self-conscious and kinda forced. It's fun, but it's not up there with Animal House or Trading Places.
B00CHMBQRA|3.0|The protagonist (an attractive and at least somewhat athletic male) works for a powerful and amoral corporation or covert agency.  He stumbles upon some information he's not supposed to know, and his employer pulls out all the stops to have him \\"erased\\" - his workplace and colleagues disappear, his cell phone and credit cards stop working, and people are trying to kill him.  Against incredible odds, he must survive on the run, solve the mystery of why this is happening, and ultimately topple the conspiracy to get the bad guy.<br /><br />Sound familiar?  You've probably seen several movies with the same plot.  The details are different.  The protagonist in this case has a teenage daughter, and the setting is Belgium.<br /><br />Aside from the recycled plot, the movie is otherwise competently crafted, fast-paced, and reasonably entertaining.<br /><br />Rent, don't buy.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I started reading this series unaware of how many books there would be!  I was hooked immediately.  I have to say I can't wait to start reading something else but at the same time I love the characters.  I have not watched the HBO series.  I wanted to wait until I finished the books but I might start now.  Lets hope there are only a couple more books!!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Chromecast's signal was never detected by either of my TVs, both of which are less than a year old. Tried six different HDMI inputs, all of which worked fine with TiVo, PS3 & AppleTV. Tried two power sources, both USB on the TV sets as suggested, or via the AC adapter to the wall. Reset the device with a 30-sec button push two different times, and even hard reset my TVs.<br /><br />I'm very proficient at both home theater setup and PCs, so I tried everything -- but never saw a setup screen, even though the device's lights were active and flashing. Phone support ruled it was defective, so I will be returning it. Very disappointed.
B003EYVXTQ|1.0|I live in Mexico with a mail service out of Laredo, TX.  Thus, to return the DVD for replacement would be expensive--probably the equivalent of $20USD in pesos.  I would have to go through Mexican Express mail since my mail service cannot ship DVDs to the USA.  Raises questions with US Customs.I am told.  So, I am stuck with a defective DVD.  Yes, my player is from the USA.  Now that Jennifer Lawrence hit the big time, I want to revisit this film she did as a teen and for which she received an Oscar Nomination.  Certainly I do not fault Amazon for this little problem.
B008Y5OW20|4.0|I wasn't sure if I'd like this album but it is infectious. Love it! Definitely worth a listen.  Lots of great old songs, many if which I was only vaguely familiar with.
B005LF9IO8|2.0|I don't want to spoil anything so let me just say if you watch this movie with just a little critical thinking you are going to be disappointed. There are logical problems throughout. The characters are played as smart and quick thinking. The story is not. Watching a supposedly smart agent walk off into the tundra in a suit (rather than changing into a suit on the outskirts of civilization) is one of the first examples you will see of this... it just puts the characters at odds with the story. They just wouldn't be this dumb.<br /><br />In addition, there are a few fairly crazy acid trip type scenes with edgy cinematography. It doesn't mix well into the movie in my opinion.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|I saw this pre-broadway and couldn't wait for the soundtrack to be released. It is amazing!!! It is no wonder it won the Musical of the year Tony award!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|McConaughey is good in this type of role. No oscar, of course. But, good for this role, and a good story. The mental games the two main characters play as the story progresses definitely keeps it fun and interesting.
B000HL09MG|1.0|Two talented actors and a great director. One terrible film. My husband and I just looked at each other and thought: what a waste. It's not even sexy (even though it has sex scenes) so you know it's really bad. Definitely skip this one.
B005LJETYI|2.0|Interesting narrative. Incredibly poor prose and juvenile one dimensional characters. Action is fairly inspired and the author is able to pastiche videogame mechanics to enhance and heighten drama.<br /><br />A mixed bag.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Great book! Historical facts are a first for me and I am sure for many others. Now I will be able to point to certain places in that part of the world with a clearer understanding of who was who.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|It was a decent tree read  but it seemed very drawn out. I expected a more dramatic ending than the one given. But it had some sweet parts for the young love.
B000FBJHZS|2.0|Found the bumbling of the tech staff at supposedly the highest level of capability insulting and worse, unbelievable in the story.<br /><br />Although I have truly enjoyed other of his books, found the plot twists clumsy at best and ingenuous at worst.<br /><br />I suppose that multiple layers of ineptitude were necessary to get to the punch line, but programs, and systemsnthat we build and nurture are our babies, and get the incredulous attention at even a hiccup...<br /><br />however, I did actually get to the end of the book
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This is a very historically accurate story of Lincoln's  tenure in the White House.  It becomes a bit dry, at times but Daniel Day Lewis does an extraordinary job of portraying this noble man.
B004N8CP8K|3.0|in an android environment, it almost does its' job. chose another product because it actually did the job required. not recommended
B009DCOU9S|3.0|The puzzles are ok. I just finished it and uninstalled. If you really have nothing to do and won't mind spend a couple of hours on randomly pop-uped game, you may or may not like this one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is such a fun game. I have always liked spider on my computer and now I have it on my kindle. Great app for sure!
0142501123|5.0|We love the book about a witch and some very helpful friends.<br />How many things can a witch fit on a broom? Well, if you ask the witch, everyone can come.<br />This witch and her adorable cat are flying high when the witch loses many of her items. I am not sure why the wind was particularly windy this day but her hat, bow and wand take off and are found by adorable animals who also want to ride with the witch much to the cat's dismay.<br /><br />Fortunately they do because the witch will need them to save her and with team work they manage to save her from a dragon who wants to eat her.<br /><br />Adorable book with sweet animals and an adorable non threatening witch. Great for kids of all ages
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I really like this particular calculator app. If I need anything more I'll whip out my scientific calculator but to do a few quick calculations this is just right.
0553381695|5.0|Don't read this one until you've read Game of Thrones!  It'll knock your greaves off!  It just keeps getting better!
1439152802|2.0|very so,so reading . did not get interesting til very end ...I thought it would pick up as I went on reading BUT NO DIDN'T HAPPEN !!!!!!!
0553386794|5.0|I was afraid to read the book at first.  I really don't like blood and violence. But I gathered the nerve to watch the series, after being told by friends and family that I would love the characters.  They weren't wrong!  And of course, the book is even richer in characters and detail than the TV series!<br /><br />For anyone who likes historical fiction and/or fantasy, give it a try!  I'll bet you'll get hooked, too!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I was interested in this purchase because was such a very good group of stories that my brother and i enjoyed - many years ago!!. Was a 'fair' price so was happy to purchase this set of Disc's . It will now be kept as another show awaiting my coming Retirement!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is by far, the richest series I've ever read in the genre.  Rich in characters, rich in story line, rich in drama, and at times, rich in laughs, too!  And very rich in wit!  Kudos, George R. R. Martin!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Quite a history lesson --------------  Every episode was exciting & made you eager for the next one. Elaborite settings and costumes with great acting !!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the characters of Downton Abbey!  Some prim and proper, some scandalous, some dutiful, some cantankerous, and some with wonderful ascerbic wit!<br /><br />Well written, well acted, great cast and guest cast!  I LOVE it!  Please keep it coming!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|It was an amazing story and especially so to me because I am a hiker.  It is hard to believe how she survived such a challenging trek with no physical preparation.  I guess youth has its advantages.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|What a fantastic read.  The book was engaging from the start and enjoyed the being swept away into what seemed like a plausible story about the human race coming together to defeat a terrible epidemic... infected humans becoming like the living dead.  The different perspectives from which the various events were seen to unfold... I can understand why it's a bestseller... I had difficulty putting the book down.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I don't like it because it is too hard for me to see the intricate differences in the patterns on my Kindle
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is one I watch over and over. It has adventure, well connected individual story lines, terrific cg visual effects, great humor - awesome!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Hi I loved it. It was awesome I am not shore but I am I am on my way to Gilliland.
B004KPX4W2|3.0|Watched this on a whim. It was nice for a rainy weekend afternoon. Nothing you haven't seen before. No great performances. Good pacing and action.
B00EEXPDTM|5.0|This dark tale about the horrific life of Linda Lovelace is hypnotizing. The cinematography is gritty. While I cant tell if the fashion(70's) is what made it so dark, or if it was a choice of the directors to bath the story in dimness.  Peter Sarsgaard portrayal of Lovelace's husband is remarkable. While historically he plays dark characters well he is particularly heinous, and subhuman in this part. His talent to paint himself as this truly despicable character will leave a bad taste in your mouth, but none the less will keep you glued to the screen as he descents.<br /><br />Other honorable mention includes Robert Patrick. His scenes seemed to touch me the most. He portrayed Lovelace's father and seemed the only one who captured what the audience is left feeling. Complete sympathy for Linda.<br /><br />With that being said if there is no other reason to watch the movie than do it for Amanda Seyfried's performance. She totally disappears in this role. She takes you through Linda's life and is able to completely emote from innocent, scared, and finally indignant. This is a daring role for someone who is usually casted as a 'darling'. Seyfried is sensational. Granted it is only August I hope that she will not be forgotten during award season.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|Overall i would say it was meh. Campy, fun, and silly.On par with the Resident Evil/Underworld/Blade franchise of movies. It's okay.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|I play on a 7&#34; tablet, and I can see and read everything I need even on the big boards. Gameplay and controls are fine.  To get a 5th star, the app needs to offer more in the way of tutorials and hints.
B00BGIBVRG|4.0|I liked the characters from Knocked Up and was happy to see they made this movie. It really displays some depth and thought with the topics of; debt, sex after 40, teenagers, mid-life crises, health, etc.Plus it was funny to boot!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I came late to this series. Got hooked immediately. Well written and acted. Watched seasons one and two in three days. Did season three and now need to wait till January for season four to begin.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|I found the ending left too much unsaid. I guess I wanted it 'wrapped up tightly' . There are more stories to tell. This leaves Archer with another trilogy to write. E.g., what happens to Jessica? Does Alex Fisher come back onto the scene? How will Giles and Gwyneth get on with their lives? Lady Virginia? What about Grace?<br />It really is a great read, but unfinished, and that is a  cheat, as it is really an unfinished book.
0399255370|5.0|My kids are grown but I still love children's books. The title of this one and the colorful cover caught my eye so I purchased it. I was smitten from the first crayon's letter. The inventiveness of the story and illustrations were first rate. Upon reflection, I think the thing I liked the most was that it reminded me that we often don't know how our actions are affecting those we love, sometimes negatively.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I like this app because it lets me see the full screen of Facebook on my kindle.  It works very well most of the time.
0156027321|3.0|The first act was very slow and boring, but the second act was very interesting and enthralling overall. In short, the life of Pi was boring, but the adventures of Pi were quite good.
B00008G8LG|5.0|We gave this as a gift and it was exactly what we wanted and at a great price. Thank you
B006M7JCC2|4.0|This is a very good book. Not only entertaining and enlightening, but inspiring as well. I bought this on a recommendation from my sister days after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Anita Moorjani's story lifted her spirits significantly.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Warning: This review is going to contain some spoilers, because I am still geeked about it.<br /><br />Premise: Aliens have decided that it's time to wreck a little hell on planet Earth and take it over. It's up the the last of the human resistance to make sure they save what's left of humanity from annihilation.<br /><br />Review: OMG, this movie had me so excited as I sat there with my tasty, unnecessarily expensive ginger ale (at least it was free refills) and overpriced \\"gourmet\\" burgers. But enough about my shake down at the cinema, and on to one of the summer's most amazing movies!<br /><br />Are you looking for action? Hell yeah, you are,  who isn't? Well, I'm here to tell you, there is tons of action in this movie. For every anime fan out there who loves anime shows/movies with huge robots battling monsters, this is also the movie for you.<br /><br />Oh, and Sons of Anarchy fans will be happy to see both Jax and Clay in the same film. *Giggle*. What I loved about Pacific Rim was the special effects. They didn't look corny or too computerized. You actually felt like what you seeing could be real. The characters were well developed and they had heart. you actually cared when something horrible happened to them. Another thing I liked was that this plot went through a time line from the first alien attack and what was done to counter future attacks. It brought you up to date. So it wasn't like you had to watch them struggle with a plan, then waste action movie time building the machines. You get to jump right into the excitement even before the credits started.<br /><br />That's how you do it, people.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and wouldn't mind seeing it again.<br /><br />Grade: A+  Look who just made the Dean's list.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I love Jillian Michael's body, and being obese in my 20s, I wanted it. I have not worked out in a very, very long time, and I started with level 1 with 2.5 pound weights. I was able to do 2 days in a row with the weights but on the third day, I was so sore I had trouble getting down my stairs and even lowering myself to sit on the toilet. I felt terrible that I was so sore after level 1, it made me feel so pathetic. I had to take a 2 day break to give my muscles some time to heal - pretty sure I tore some of my leg muscles with the strength exercises. Today is day 5, and so far I've done the DVD 3 times. I decided to modify 2 of the exercises - the static lunge with a bicep curl, and the side lunge with anterior raise. Today I decided to do those 2 without weights; I still felt like I was getting a workout. Tomorrow I plan to use weights with one of the repetitions, she has you do those moves two or three times I think. I don't think I'll be ready to move to level 2 for a while, I want to be totally comfortable with level 1 first. I would advise anyone who is having a hard time with level 1 to try some of the exercises without weights. It's still effective in my opinion but not so damaging to my weak muscles. You do have to push yourself but, tearing muscles is no fun. Overall I love this DVD and I love that it's only 20 minutes. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The condition it came in is as if I picked from the store shelf myself.  Can't wait to compare the picture quality to my DVD version of this.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|Sorry, I had to cancel this because it's the UK version and it won't work on a U.S. dvd. The series is GREAT. I borrowed series I and II and can't wait to get Series III. The series has a lot of characters and has me glued to the t.v. Please Amazon, get Series III in U.S. version.<br /><br />Thanks.
B005HSL626|4.0|this is one of the best games ever invented. it is so fun and addicting. the only problem is that after I have had the game for a while it wont open and stops working. but still an epic game
B008O9V4C2|5.0|This album proves once again that Donald Fagen was truly the driving creative force of Steely Dan! I have almost all of the Steely Dan albums and can trace IMHO their growth from their last album Gaucho to Fagen's solo effort Nightfly to this album which is my favorite yet. If you are a Steely Dan fan like me get this album. It has an wonderful overt blues-ey, slightly funky sound and feel filtered through the familiar vocals and wonderful lyrics that have captured me from the old days of Steely Dan! My new favorite for sure!
B0073PZU82|2.0|Thought such a cast would give us an excellent film to view - however, the ending was ridiculous and very poorly done!
1400079144|1.0|The only reason I have given one star is because it is not possible to award less. I do not care that critics think little of Brown as a writer, but this book is formulaic and brainless - as indeed are it's protagonists. These people are supposed to be highly intelligent, yet constantly make the most stupid assumptions and continually fail to learn from their errors. Anyone who is prepared to accept anything anyone tells them on a telephone - as these people do - lack even the most basic common sense. The story is such a farcical mess that it merits no more of a review than to state - it is trash, from beginning to end.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Lots of action, a little bit of love, strong friendships and a nice segue into the next book we'll see
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Rented this com amazon cuz my kids wanted to see it. They are 10, 7 and 4. The 4 year old didn't get into it but the other two enjoyed it. Wasn't sure if parts would be too scary but they seemed fine.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I don't know if I can ever get enough of Gideon and Eva!  I love how their relationship takes on a much more playful side in EWY.  Please don't let it be so long until the next one!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This is my first Angry Birds game and I enjoy the mashup of scenery, character types made into birds or pigs, and various powers and abilities.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows by far. It has a great plot interesting characters and a fresh feel.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun if you like detective and hidden object games.  Each level is more of a challenge.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game is fun, but the constant missions to promote it on social media is annoying. It is not the responsibility of the player to advertise a game.
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|Great children/family movie.  You cannot go wrong with this purchase. It teaches children many lessons without them even knowing it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|i think this is amazing and it's just what i was looking for.  like other reviewers have said netflix, youtube & play video's work best and the quality from the browser isn't great (still not terrible).  This is a great purchase and i can't believe it's $35 ... props to google for the price point alone i would highly recommend this device
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Addicting! Just got it and can't stop playing. Nice graphics and no annoying ads. Collect coins for free in game upgrades.
1400079144|5.0|This novel is a typical Dan Brown reading full of twists, turns and suspense.<br />I will buy and read anything he writes.
B009RH973I|3.0|I am only somewhat satisfied. The hard shell is good protection for the kindle, but the cover is too flexible, floppky to support the kindle as a stand.
0553208845|5.0|I loved this book! Surprisingly my theology teacher who was a Deacon assigned this book back in college a few years ago. I was confused at first by why he would assign this book but it literally strengthen my faith and made it very clear for me that the path I was going down was right, it was and is my own way of achieving Om. An amazing read and I highly recommend it ^_^
B004G0SJU8|5.0|Reminds me of mythology tales of the Moon chasing the Sun...or was it the other way around. A decent love story that pulls at the heart strings for the risks and pains that we might endure to experience love. A little giggle that Nick Cage spends most of his time looking like a sad puppy looking at a steak in the window.
1402713185|5.0|Great read for me and my child, I get to share with him my childhood books. The books arrived fast and new as promised.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent show!  I couldn't bear to wait for Season 3 to come on Netflix.  Can't wait for the new season!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I wish there is more stage. The three stages gets boring after playing it for awhile. But its fun to play.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really enjoyed this and would highly recommend it as a fun, summer read.  If you're a Jodi Picoult fan, you'll love this.  It's full of twists and surprises.  I am usually pretty good at predicting outcomes but this one surprised me.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I am not a hard core OZ person, however what I could remember of the first movie, &#34;The Wizard of OZ.&#34;  This film seemed to hit all the right ideas about what would happen in the storyline for a prequel.  The movie had a good flow to it and the land of OZ was beautiful to see on HD!<br /><br />  I did enjoy the discovery of why the wicked witch is green.<br /><br />  It is worth the time and money spent to watch, in my limited opinion.<br /><br /> (If you are a hard core OZ person, look to another review.)
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I could not stop watching! Even my husband who does not watch tv got into this show. Well written and very addictive.
B002NNA9N0|1.0|This movie had a lot of good name actors which, I have seen before in the past.  So, I thought it was a safe bet for a movie to watch for the night at a $1.99 and two hours with the kids asleep, why not?  Wrong!  It was a horrible movie, filled with endless dribble and cussing.  You would do better to sit at college bar on a Saturday night to hear all the F ing this and that's which were used to the point that it became boring.<br /><br />As for any action, do not look here, this movie had none.<br /><br />Once the end finally came around, I could have cared less at the results of all the end less dialogue I tried to pay attention to.  The acting was good ,however the characters are not developed enough to give a rats about one way or the other.<br /><br />In the end, I wasted time & money on this flick.
B000FC12ZA|1.0|This book was an effort to read.  I would have quit as soon as I realized it was complete rubbish being passed off as a true story! Anyone who has been to the area would know this.  It did succeed in making me quite angry to think the author took people to be so gullible. My only reason for finishing the book was to be able to discuss it with a Canadian friend who recommended it to me as a book of interest.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really love this game. It is good for all ages. However, I feel if I have bad 3G/4G or I am not connected to WI-FI I cannot play, that is the only downfall of this game. Otherwise, it is extremely fun and addicting.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|This is a great season. It's not a reboot or restart or whathaveyou to the series. I, personally, did not mind any of the previous seasons. I love the show, I love the cast and crew and characters, and sure I may have my favorite episodes or seasons but I don't hate or dislike any of them. I will say that this season in particular though did stand out, there is a lot of character development all over the board. Some of the arcs don't get completed (or are they?) how I would have liked but they're handled well enough that they don't really detract from the overall season. We see a lot of emotional moments, a lot of amazing acting and chemistry and even some new awesome characters. The finale of this season is epic and mind blowing and if it doesn't leave you a puddle on the floor then I dare say there maybe something wrong with you. This show is great, this season stands out to a lot of people who've seen it and is generally amazing and will rock your socks off. Purgatory was done in an awesome way, new characters will twist and pull you, and the overall arc really comes to a head and opens a lot, and I mean a lot of new doors. Definitely worth buying.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|My alarm clock is a great app. Works efficiently. I especially like  being able  to program your own music .  I don't think more sounds, ocean, rain,nature, should be included. Optional backgrounds would also be a nice feature. I wouldn't  mind paying extra.
B00APAS1MY|3.0|I am a lover of Coelho's books, have read them all, this one left me curious as to having a storyline, more like a book of inner thoughts not put together in the usual story as he always does. Bit sad on this one, struggled to get through it. :(
B0081336FO|5.0|Very addictive.  I am anxiously awaiting the third series.  PBS if you're listening show the third series the same day as it's shown on the BBC!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Swept away by the plot and characters.  This, for me, second Reacher novel didn't disappoint.  Recommended to anyone who enjoys this character.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|All these songs are so good and they really know how to perform each one!  Love watching them sing 'TREASURE'!  Reminds me of Earth, Wind and Fire!  Good music...
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Couldn't put this one down.  It's refreshing to meet a humble man with ethics, dedication, intelligence with his raw talent.  A good  read.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Works very well.  Recording sound is high quality.  I only wish that there was some sort of light or indicator of battery life or at least that the unit is powered on.  Otherwise, great value for the price.  If connecting to a phone, make sure you buy an adapter cable so that the phone will recognize it as a microphone rather than headphone output.  I purchased a 1/8&#34; phone microphone adapter from KV Connection and have it all paired up to my Nokia Lumia 920.  Now I get great video AND audio!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really enjoy Pinterest and to have it on my phone is really neat.  It gives me so many ideas that I can take along when shopping.
086719720X|5.0|I have most of Mark Ryden's books. I think this one is the truest to his nature. It is all written in Japanese but the various paintings are all so great that the language doesn't even matter. It's hard to put down. I'm very happy with it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I would recomend this game.  It is fun to play when you are sitting waiting for something.  The only thing is you have to start the level you were in all over again if you don't finish it.
1490313370|5.0|If you are in a quandary about what you want to do with your life, this is a great book for wrapping your head around what you need to do to get either your ship &#34;righted&#34; or moving in a new direction. Excellent direct writing style with good humor blended with the right dash of seriousness. A fun read. Thanks James!!!
B005MMY5RK|2.0|it was black and white and very gloomy. The speech was not very clear . I always wanted to see the renowned classical movie to know what it is all about.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This movie series is great, just great. The story plot and the actors are fantastic.  I can not wait for Season 4 to come out.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. Kept me guessing what the outcome would be from the very beginning.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Couldn't put it down!! Read it in two sittings. I wish their was a sequel to this book. The second book is the same story in Travis' perspective.
B001NOQI3U|4.0|I was concerned that this movie is a musical but there was not a lot of music.  I loved this movie for the history and the culture, I learned from it.  I'm not big on romance stories but this story was different and interesting and culturally based. If you like history and culture you will enjoy this movie
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|This game is great it has awesome graphics, gun play and combat.the driving is kind of hard. trying to do sharp turns when speeding will make you crash in a wall. I'm also a little disappointed that there is no multiplayer though, but other than that it is a great game.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|Even though Gary Oldman is only on screen less than 15 minutes, it is a great performance.<br />I only wish their topic of conversation with Samuel L. Jackson and Paul Bates could have been cleaned up a little  bit.<br /><br />Enjoyed performances by the late Dennis Hopper & James Gandolfini.<br /><br />So sorry for the loss of Director Tony Scott.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|GREAT GAME I BEG U PLEASE GET THIS GAME CAN'T GET ENOUGH SO ADDICTING BEST GAME I OWN OVERALL 10 STARS
B004PR71JC|5.0|The movie is a big hit with my boys. Very cute with great music! The whole family can enjoy this movie.
B00CZAYOWI|5.0|my favorite band of all time am very happy they are still together and recording they are like a fine wine they the cult just get better with time arrived in a timely manner, very happy thanks Greg.
B00947N6D8|5.0|The movie is now one of my son's favorite. What a great story and so magical. It's something the whole family can enjoy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is totally worth the 7 dollars! I love it! I play it about every day! It has no actual point, which is what I like about it! IT NEVER ENDS!!!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I had heard great things about this movie and I was not disappointed. Lots of laughs. The minions were fabulous and it truly turned out to be a heartwarming tale. I can't wait to see the sequel.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I read this in one day on a long flight. I enjoyed every minute of it. It was humorous and engaging, but also had a serious storyline that would lend itself well to discussion. I definitely recommend this one.
0061537969|5.0|Our book club selected this book and we all love it.  This is a great book to share with all your dog loving friends.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season Three was awesome! And heart wrenching. Awards should be coming! Can not wait for season four to begin! Thank you Amazon for making DA available.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I was hooked the moment I started. Very touching and well written. A very good read, I highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|couldn't see how to do the game.  Really didn't like it very much.  Thought it would be a little easier to do.  No instructions.
B004LDLI0S|3.0|I wanted to read this because I had heard so much about it.  He sounded like a same individual but we all know what happened.  It reminded me of the United States today.
B00AFPVPDG|5.0|This book will absolutely change the way you learn. The process outlines such a different approach from what we were taught in school about how to learn. Josh places this method in front of you in short order and then uses examples from his learning life to demonstrate how it works. He takes us along for the ride while he learns to Yoga, Programing, Touch Typing, Go, Windsurfing and how to play the Ukulele. Not to be missed. And...the cover is yellow!<br /><br />-Thomas
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|This movie starts out very difficult to understand and hard to watch from the upside down view, but I still loved it. I had to watch it more than once with my husband who also enjoyed it. A must see.
B009K0OL06|3.0|This reminds me a lot of the final season of 'Heroes', where the writers didn't seem to know where to take the overall plot, so we ended up with a string of events unrelated to the original premise.  Hope next season is better.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much always watch these actors in any movie that is make with them acting in it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a fun game. Needs more places to run around in. Like it don't have to spend real money.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Me and family was always a lord of the ring fan. We watch these movie over and over, and  this movie was awesome a great family movie to watch.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|The initial premise is an interesting idea, the acting is quite good and there are no dull moments.<br />However, there are huge gaping holes in the storyline.  Just to give one away:  Bruce Willis, a retired CIA agent lives in a residential neighborhood and is on friendly terms with his closeby neighbors.  When his name comes up on a secret list for elimination, the bad guys attack in the middle of the night with a full range of assault weapons, destroy his home and yet, not one peep or even a light from any other homes on the block!<br />If you're just wanting 2 hours of adventure, without having to think about it ever again, this may be just the thing for you.
0920668372|5.0|I own a preschool and this is one of my all time favorite books. The story is tender and sweet and  the children love to hear it read, over and over again.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|This book is a fast read but very enjoyable. I loved the character development to the point where you feel every single character's emotions and feelings.  If you want a nice calm summer read this isn't it but if you want a fast paced book that will keep your heart pounding get this book and don't hesitate.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|The first one disintegrated, Kindle send me another one hope this one stays intact. It happens the same with the one my wife has
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|I don't normally read this type of story because I'm kind of a softy but this story pulled me in.  It reminded me of the feelings I had when my grandfather passed when I was 18.  I actually empathized with the main character Amanda, her life felt like my life as I was reading.  This is a story that will stay with me for a very long time, and in a good way.
B00C3UUZVE|4.0|I've only downloaded the free version for now, but my three-year-old grandson enjoys it a lot.  It's easy for him to use and he has spent a good deal of time playing it.
B00B8YSIMY|5.0|I was never addicted to drugs or alcohol but I was a gambling addict and as an addict I can appreciate the story a lot.  I got in deep with the wrong people just like Jimmy did and let me tell you that is something that can haunt you for a very long time.  This book really hit home and is an excellent read for addicts and non addicts alike.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The author seems to have thought the subject through to a level I hadn't thought possible.<br />Great read, especially for the more analytically-inclined reader
1452000247|5.0|This book brought me back to my childhood. I loved the story and the descriptions of the world that Peter is in made me feel like I was there right along with him.  The author's imagination is amazing. Peter's character meets up with so many different beings and creatures it is mind boggling how Mr. O'Brien came up with all of them.  If you want to leave our world and enjoy a magical world that will blow your mind pick this book up and not only will you not want to put it down but you will want to believe you are Peter on this awesome journey.
B001JP5JRY|2.0|I had the Kindle edition.<br />The tables and some other features were just scans of the book, at very low quality, so that they became unreadable.<br />I highly discourage buying the Kindle edition, but I would like to note that once I complained Amazon reimbursed me that same day despite having bought it a full month earlier
B008AVXGA2|5.0|I bought this book so I could read it to my 9 year old daughter. She loved the story and wanted me to read this over and over again.  I actually stopped reading it to her after the second time.  I love reading to my daughter but at 9 she can read herself so I let her take my kindle for the night.  She told me she read it 5 more times before she finally got tired and went to sleep.  Please Julia will you write more stories like this so my daughter and I can share in their awesomeness.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is by far in the top three games I have ever played. It has it all, action, racing, and adventure. My uncle enjoyed this game tremendously, and he is 52! I would totally recommend this game to anyone who likes action. P.S. upgrade dune buggy. It is AWESOME!
B002PEP4C8|4.0|I liked the story line that she fought for her sanity. The trials and ripple effects on her family, relationships, etc. Other than the daRKNESS (WHICH IS LIFE) of the story, it was a convoluted.
0375826726|5.0|Lots of suspense and action that kept me reading until I finished the book.  I was a bit shocked to discover that the apparent &#34;trilogy&#34; actually is 4 books long.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to swear by this app.<br />Now with this new upgrade its useless. Its hard to navigate, and you get these stupid reward points for watching videos that have nothing to do with weather?!!<br />I am actually uninstalling this app and looking for something new that will give me weather,  not points.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|If you plan to read this series, tell your friends and family that you're going into the witness protection program or moving to remote Antarctica or participating in the first colony of civilians on the moon. You will thank me for the pre planning advice. Once you start this series you literally cannot put it down. I initially avoided the series because I find it tedious work to enter fictional worlds that are so densely populated. I gave up on Lord of the Rings because of the in depth network of characters and populations. I may revisit the series after having such a great experience with the Song of Fire and Ice series.  Now, I've got to get back to reading...
B00457WZEI|5.0|I really love ed this book I would give this book 4 stars.<br /><br />I hoped this helped<br /> And you should watch the movie version.:)
B008XBHIEY|5.0|A little shaking, little tenderizing, and down you go. So much better than discovery, at least with this you know it is fiction from the beginning.
B000002J1L|5.0|By the time Nursery Cryme was recorded, Genesis had grown confidently in their musical and lyrical direction, and were poised to become a stellar band. The final push to greatness came with the addition of guitar virtuoso Steve Hackett and world class drummer Phil Collins to the band. At this point, they only had room to grow, and by all means they grew spectacularly.<br /><br />From the first track, it is clear: this is a newer and more perfected Genesis. That first track happens to be one of their best songs, The Musical Box. This was the first song the band created that had a story behind it, which helped to finally overcome their lyrical problem by providing a sensible outlet for their more outlandish ideas. Indeed, most of the songs on this album have stories, which helps even the weaker ones to not suffer lyrically. This also helped the band to stand out among their prog peers, who often wrote songs of mysticism, but rarely full fledged stories.<br /><br />On the musical side of things, this album is where Genesis comes into its own. While Anthony Phillips was a good guitarist in his own right, Steve Hackett's ability to use a guitar to accentuate but not overwhelm a song makes him infinitely superior. He was also one of the first to use the famous \\"tapping\\" guitar technique later perfected by Edward Van Halen. He's not at his greatest here, but his presence is welcomed and he adds a new and exciting flavor to the mix of music. Tony Banks also sheds his gentle keyboard playing in favor of his signature aggresive yet controlled Mellotron and Hammond playing, further accentuating the music. He also develops a unique \\"dueling\\" sound with Hammond's guitar playing, a style unfortunately not used on any subsequent Genesis album.<br /><br />Are there problems on Nursery Cryme? Yes, but they are rather minor. Some of the songs on it do feel pointless, most notably For Absent Friends, which is certainly a sweet little song, but does not really feel like a necessary addition to the album. Of particular complaint is the final song, The Fountain of Salmacis. While it contains some of their most unique music, the song is ultimately too long and the story to convoluted to make it anything special. Some of the more poppy tunes also feel a little too heavy for their own good. The main offender in this is the hard-hitting pop tune Harold the Barrel, which tells a sad tale of suicide in contrast to its jumpy music. However, as mentioned, these are minor flaws and do not detract substantially from the overall experience of the album.<br /><br />Nursery Cryme was a major step in the right direction for Genesis. They had begun to shed their previous weaknesses, and had grown substantially since their debut and sophomore albums. That growth brought about much better lyrics and music and laid the groundwork for further masterpieces.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is amazing. Tina Fey is a wonderful role model - she has a strong, hilarious, distinctly female presence that is inspiring to read.
B000002NZO|4.0|After their ambitious but ultimately flat first effort, Genesis moved fully into what had by 1970 become recognized as prog rock. Many (including the band members themselves) cite this as the first true Genesis album, and in many ways, that is a true statement. Certainly it is more recognizable as the Genesis that dominated the prog rock scene of the 70s, most noticeably in the fact that they no longer had to write poorly constructed pop songs to please their record label. Not a single song on this album is in any way a pop song, and it is a much better album just for that.<br /><br />That being said, there are still quite a few problems with Trespass. The first and foremost is the same problem that plagued their first album, that being the lyrics. While the songs on here are far superior to the songs on From Genesis to Revelation, their new lyrical direction feels clumsy and uneven, with the lyrics containing elements of hokey and unintelligible mysticism, with a few downright stupid lines. The worst offender in this is probably the opening track, Looking For Someone, which from the very first line sets itself up as a poorly written piece of lyricism. While I can accredit the song as a musical piece, the lyrics on this particular song are perhaps the worst of any Genesis song.<br /><br />Another issue that stems in part from their transition to prog rock is the length of each of the songs. True, prog is known as a genre of LONG songs, but the ones it is predominantly remembered for are masterpieces such as 2112, or Close to the Edge. The songs on this album simply are not good enough to accredit their length. While none of the songs are stretched to intolerably long lengths, they still feel lacking and hollow. I feel like some of these pieces, notably Visions of Angels, are stretched to their long run times intentionally, which is a shame because if they were shrunken in length they would stand out as very good songs.<br /><br />Of course, Trespass does have far more good points than its predecessor. The music in this album has grown substantially from the last, with every song showcasing the more expert and relaxed approach. Tony Banks' mastery of keyboards is far more evident, with Visions of Angels being the prime example on this album. Of course, he finally began using Mellotron and Hammond synthesizers on this album, and though they are scarcely used, when they are it is immensely enjoyable. Anthony Phillips, while quitting the band to be replaced by the far superior Steve Hackett after this album, comes into his own on this album, with beautiful acoustic guitar on the track Dusk. A weak link is provided in John Mayhew's drumming, but it isn't really bad, just passable and not comparable in any way to the genius of Phil Collins.<br /><br />Perhaps the finest point on this album comes in the form of the final song, The Knife. This is the best indicator of what lies ahead on future Genesis albums. It sounds like a true Genesis song, and escapes all the problems the prior songs exhibit. While not a perfect song, it is by far the best song of the pre-classic Genesis lineup.<br /><br />So while Trespass is not a vast improvement over its predecessor, it is still an improvement, and one that is built upon to produce the masterpieces of Prog that Genesis became known for in the 70s.

B001HM1PFO|5.0|Everyone who's seen it with me loves it. I got steered toward the movie by a friend. To see Tim Curry in Drag and singing his heart out is just fantastic. I love it! So glad I decided to see what all the fuss was about.
B002NZV68U|3.0|my 11 year old daughter read Roald Dahl's book by the same name.  she was disappointed that the movie did not seem to capture the story as she conceived it.  It's certainly an interesting visual experience though.  as an adult I found several of the key scenes quite emotional, so i guess that's a plus.
B00992CF6W|5.0|me and my son and nephews love playing this game. great for creativity and imagination. Makes you think if you want awesome buildings , waterslides and more.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Barely fits in my case, however before I installed this heat sink my computer would often overheat despite my best efforts of adding extra case fans. My cpu would jump from idling at 40-45 to over 80-85 under load. 85 was set in my bios as the max temp so it would trigger a safety restart. My cpu now never goes above 60 even while playing skyrim on extra high graphics or war thunder on high settings. Excellent product! Make sure it will fit in your case. It was easy to install, only took about 20 minutes including taking out the mobo and replacing it.
B008RXYOKY|4.0|My MacBook Air doesn't have USB 3, so until now I had relied on USB 2 and gotten along OK.  Getting a firewire drive and thunderbolt adaptor really speeds up data transfers.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! Being in Afghanistan myself when this whole fiasco took place contributes to my interest. Reading the account from an inside perspective is vastly better than what one could ever hope to gain from the media.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|At first I didn't think that I would really use this app that much, but I was wrong. I use it when I house/pet sit for friends and family. Since I do not know their houses as well as mine, and it is hard to move around in the dark, the flashlight is wonderful! I love how you can change the brightness of the light as well as the color. Sometimes at night, you don't want a bright white light.
B00735HGQ6|4.0|What started out as a simple errand to mail a letter resulted in a difficult, tedious mission. This mission reveals<br />detail by detail, step by step a life's journey, full of moments of happiness, challenges, dreams unfulfilled, regrets and misunderstandings. Along the way, Harold Frye meets people from all walks of life, each one adding their own flavour to this pilgrimage. Many moments are inspirational as the reader shares such raw determination and resolve to complete the journey, despite discomforts, pain and setbacks. This book was very recommmended and I will pay it forward.

B007HGPBRC|5.0|This a a good compilation of Christopher Hitchens essays about his cancer struggles that appeared in Vanity Fair.  Although I had read them in the magazine, I enjoyed rereading them together where they had a much greater impact as a whole.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|I have read a lot of Steinbeck in the past but felt this book daunting before actually trying to read it. It is expansive and wonderfully complex. The movie with James Dean covers only one small part of the total story. This is worth the time and effort. Most satisfying.
B008Y73940|5.0|Great movie with a great plot.  Most of the twists and turns I never saw coming.  Good light entertainment and I love Matthew McConaughey!
B006CUDDUG|5.0|But even better when you read Call for the Dead first. The twist at the end is more dramatic and surprising.

B00E5SCOS4|1.0|I tend to only write reviews of recordings that I like.  It was excitement that drew me to this album by an artist that I really liked.  When I listened to all of the samples, I found that I didn't like any of them.  The songs were maudlin and lacked any excitement.  KT has changed.  I'll think twice before I looking at her music again.  Too bad.
B000HL2J0G|4.0|As like the previous programs, they were all most enjoyable. Still clean, wholesome entertainment.<br />Would not hesitate to have the younger generation watch.

B008KHRODG|5.0|These episodes are absolutely incredible. Every Doctor Who fan needs these specials. The audio and picture quality is top notch, considering that it is a DVD, and each and every one of these little mini-movies are worth your time and money.

0440246318|5.0|I am reading it now, and I'm about half-way through it. It is an on-the-edge-of-your-seat read, and I find myself reading way into the night! I want to find out how this one will end, but I don't want it to end. I have been reading all of the Jack Reacher series, in order, and love them all!
B008BF9ZFM|4.0|Good story about a fishing derby! I would have enjoyed a few pictures, but you can't go wrong with this book. The author does a great job of fitting the story together and keeping it in rhythm.
B009LMTDL0|1.0|The way she describes her background leaves no sign of the Women's Liberation movement that went before her.<br />This woman thinks history is last Tuesday.<br />It's hard to believe that she is as successful as she is.<br />Certainly no evidence of this in this boring book
B006PKV2QU|4.0|This story was good. It kept my daughter asking questions. After I finish, she demanded that I read KIDS I KNOW which is another Peter Collier book. It almost feels like she knows the author's work and wants to hear more of it.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Parody disguised as adventure and travelogue. Violent but cartoony very quickly. Especially enjoyed Bruce Willis and Helen Mirren in their roles as 'reluctantly' unretired agents.

1452242569|4.0|Purchased to help think through my dissertation proposal. Yin provides a thoughtful overview of case study methodology, including attention to both larger considerations of using case study findings to further analytic generalizations and to the step-by-step details of doing case study research.

B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|Seriously. It's about ten dollars to unlock everything. I think all the  characters should at least be free instead of paying five dollars for one. Other than that I like it.
B000JIHP88|1.0|Same as some of the other reviews.  Worked great at first but after only 4 uses the mobile stopped rotating.  Very disappointing and still trying to figure out how to return because it was a gift and I don't have any receipts.  Boo.<br /><br />UPDATE: I called Fisher Price and they had me mail the base to them and they mailed me a new mobile.  The new one stopped working too!!!  I called Fisher Price again and they mailed me a refund coupon.  It was the biggest hassle being a new mother.  Do not buy this product.
B00AYM6JFO|3.0|Hero's was so good with his son Lukas,nice songs,as well with Merle an Kris,this one i was really disappointed.i will get the new one, to all the girls,should be good with the line up that will be on with him, seen him in person so many times with his family,love him anyway.

B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game is addicting and fun. It has good graphics,  and is well made...Nice going Gameloft! You guys haven't disappointed me yet. The controls are a quirky for me,  but that's my only qualm.

B00CCEHR80|3.0|My favorite time listening to Jerry was the 70's Beacon Theater,Capitol Theater in Jersey City the Pirates Cruse around Manhattan with the Hells Angels as security so on and so on. Not to say there weren't great concerts in the 80's and 90's but for a whole lot of us the 70's were pure magic pure Jerry.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|La clasifique 5 estrellas por su realizaci&oacute;n, su realismo y valor istri&oacute;nico.<br /><br />Recomiendo la colecci&oacute;n, no debe faltar en una cineteca (videoteca) que se jacte de tener lo bueno y cl&aacute;sico.<br /><br />La restauraci&oacute;n es impecable. El sonido muy bueno. El doblaje y la titulaci&oacute;n excelente.

0486284735|5.0|The best lines in Pride and Prejudice naturally go to its heroine Lizzie Bennet, the clever and hilariously impudent daughter of early 19th century English minor landed gentry--who is not above taking to task those considered above her station in life, including the wealthy scion Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy and his insufferably arrogant aunt Lady Catherine de Bourg.  I must confess that I like Lizzie Bennet very much, and that she reminds me of the sort of girl to whom I have always been attracted!
B00338QENI|5.0|I am not sure why I came low expectations but for a nonfiction book, I really enjoyed this story.<br /><br />The author does an amazing job of helping you related to the Lacks family while not overwhelmingly taking any one side. I feel like anyone even remotely interested in science, epidemiology, human rights or the law should definitely read this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Slow at start but worth sticking in there. Very crazy games sure to get anyone going. So excited to read book 3!
B00AMS38YU|5.0|and nice way to display NYC, we ,liked it a lot !<br />Very good action movie with a ok story
B001DE29SS|5.0|I once found a video on youtube that had the Great Dictator speech. I had heard of Chaplin prior to seeing the video, but never went beyond that much. After that video, I got curious. I saw a few of the films and thought,&#34;Neat.&#34; Then, I came across this film. Not only does it hold the life story (mostly) of Mr. Chaplin, he's played by one of my favorite actors (Robert Downey Jr.).<br />The film goes over the life of Charlie Chaplin. From the humble beginnings as a child performer to the move to America to the Red Scare and ultimately his return to the US after the US kicked him out for suspicion of communism. Now, to warn parents who happen to be scrolling down, this does contain some nudity, which I would normally not approve of, but in this case, historical accuracy wins over family friendliness. Another note on accuracy, they get alot of it right, but they cut alot of it out as well. It came to the Great Dictator speech in the film and they cut half of it out, which dissappointed me.<br />Overall, I love this film. It's an incredible story of an incredible man who ate, slept, and breathed his art. Chaplin's a big inspiration to me seeing as I want to pursue an acting career myself... acting in cartoons, but acting nonetheless. But overall, it's just me. Want a clear verdict on the film? Check it out for yourself.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|So what to say more than that ?<br />remarkable and incredibly well played.<br />Go for it, you will love it
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I had a tough time really getting into this, but I did really enjoy the relationships between characters.  Great story!
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Not a ground breaking movie in Sci-Fi but good enough to entertain people.<br />Well shot even though some fx are a bit under what I expected.
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|If your cinematic taste involves those old fashioned spook-shows of yesteryear (like \\"The Innocents\\" or \\"The Spiral Staircase\\"), this might be just the ticket. \\"The Woman in Black\\" practically oozes creepy, gothic, sinister ambience with its macabre mansion and fogbound countryside and cemetery.<br /><br />The story was decent, and the ending was surprisingly poignant (I was expecting much more of a frightful climax rather than what actually transpired). Had the plot been more solid I would have given higher marks here ... the three stars are strictly for the ghastly trappings, which I enjoy; for more of that stuff, see \\"The Haunting\\" (1963), \\"The Changeling\\", and \\"The Others\\".
B005LAIH2C|3.0|a very different take on the old fairy tail.  I did enjoy watching it is  just not a riviting plot.

B00DHNBPA6|5.0|I was very surprised by the movie, went a little bit in a different direction than the original.  But some of the same feeling was there, with the old beat up cabin in the woods.  If you liked the original, you will enjoy this remake.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|Most Superman fans tend to either love it or hate it.  There's certainly at least one scene that is very bold for a Superman movie.  It's made it very controversial, but I think it's what has made the movie go beyond a safe, boring and generic experience.  Viewers were disappointed with Superman Returns because they said it didn't have enough action; now critics say Man of Steel has too much action.<br /><br />I enjoyed both movies, but they were very different kinds of movies.  Superman Returns was a movie about SUPERMAN - an experienced and recognized hero who sacrifices himself for mankind.<br /><br />Man of Steel is pre-Superman.  Right now, Clark is someone who is trying to find his place.  He knows he wants to help people; but he's always been helping in small ways.  His whole life he has been holding back his strength and powers.  During the fight with Zod, we can see that this isn't the experienced Superman we are used to.  This is his first time revealing himself and the first time he is ever in a REAL fight.  A fight between Kryptonians is devastating.  He's outnumbered, outmatched, as well as being the most inexperienced.<br /><br />The devastation caused by the Zod and Superman fight have certainly set the stage for the next movie.<br /><br />Overall, tt's a more realistic take than any previous Superman movie.  If you are expecting a Christopher Reeve experience with updated special effects, you will be disappointed.  It's not that kind of movie.<br /><br />My favorites: the extended scene on Krypton (finally!), the updated suit (beautiful), as well as Zod and Faora.<br />Biggest con: sometimes, the movie just didn't flow from one part to the next - had a sort of \\"choppy\\" feel.<br /><br />Still, I loved it.  Saw it several times as soon as it came out and look forward to the release date!
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|This game is interesting, but it is not captivating. After a couple of games I am ready to move on. I do like that there is a single player or pass and play option.
B001AR4K8K|5.0|this movie is as good as the first time I saw it, many, MANY years ago!  If you enjoy vampire movies you are sure to love this...the humor is wonderful....the setting is perfect....It has a little more gore in it than I would have liked....but the humor more than makes up for it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Love everything about these books, I have read them multiple times! I would highly reccomend these books to anyone! !
B0063IH60K|4.0|I played the heck out of this game until the last update when it no longer runs without connecting.  conserving power on my kindle fire is a big deal and I often turn off the wifi to do so--especially at night.  I'll find a different game.  I also presume all Mobility games are going this way so will avoid them as well.  4stars for the content but its off my devices.  hummed.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|has not loaded .....3 days later!!!!!!  have no idea what is going on but even when I click on app shows loading
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Whoever came up with this &quot;update&quot; has screwed you guys and all users as well.  Navigation nightmare, too much useless carp.  If I wanted an app with all the rewards points I would go get one.  Remove the commercials, they take up too much screen space.  The original founder of the Weather Channel remarked, after he sold the channel, that what it has become is nothing near what it's original concept was.  Drop the idea you need to be an entertainment venue and simply give us the Weather. That is all we want from you.  Weather, as accurate as you can guess it.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|Outstanding collection of music by one of the masters. Buddy gives it his all inspite of his age - this man's music is ageless. Fans of Buddy will be enthralled by this album, fans of the blues (and newcomers to the genre) will hear what it's really all about! Get this album!

B00DB31Y3U|3.0|Some of you are overzealous in deciding an app requires no permissions at all, and the one other review mentioning them seems to think the developer maliciously added in an internet connection to the application.<br /><br />The Play Store version has ads, which require the same set of permissions. This version has the ads removed, but the developer has not removed the permissions. Fine.<br /><br />However, I'm rather curious about it asking to connect to Bluetooth devices.<br /><br />Otherwise, the game is a game. It's another app that is free because Amazon ran out of top shelf content to offer.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I will be buying this book in paper/hard copy!

0060723513|1.0|I read this book as my dear friend spoke highly of it and I felt drawn to learn more about our native brothers and sisters on a continent I have never visited. It seemed like a lovely introduction to Aboriginal Peoples. Within the pages, Marlo delivered some nice messages, I felt at home with the story because it rang of Native American tradition and I am at home with North American Native American culture. I know nothing of the Aborigines.<br /><br />But even as I read there were things that just seemed like they did not fit. The trek in a hot desert climate to go no where seems more like a story than anything that people would actually do. It does not fit common sense, and common sense is the basis of all civilizations that last thousands of years.<br /><br />At any rate, I did read it all and then, since my friend said that Marlo gave workshops and talked about her journey, I wanted to see what this American author has been doing since her transformative experience.<br /><br />What I discovered showed me just how naive and gullible I can be.<br /><br />I was open to believe and thus overlooked the many flags my mind showed me as I read; like the pool of water in the middle of a desert land containing crocodiles. Even here in the states we know that crocs live in wetlands, how in the world could they be in the location that Marlo writes about.<br /><br />So what I learned is that this is completely fiction. It is the worst kind of fiction because it uses an endangered people as its means to give the author authority in the world.<br /><br />Marlo has taught workshops claiming that she has been given the task to share the wisdom of the Aboriginal Peoples because they have chosen to die off. These are lies and to do this is to injure not only the people you claim to have received the wisdom from, but all those who come to the workshops expecting to receive sacred knowledge from one deemed to have received it and claiming to be an expert. This is appalling, it is immoral, and it embarrasses me as an American and an author.<br /><br />The Indigenous People worldwide work diligently to promote understanding, peace, and awareness of the planet. But everywhere on this planet the governments and many of the national people create legislation to destroy Native Peoples and their culture.<br /><br />Marlo profited on lies so vast that she has made countless people worldwide believe that the Aborigines have chosen to die off. This is unconscionable. It would be a great benefit to her at every level to not only tell the world that it is truly a work of fiction, but to donate a large sum of her profits to the Aboriginals for the damage she has caused.<br /><br />So here I am going to add a note directly to the author ~ Marlo, do the right thing and clear your soul. Perhaps this whole book simply got out of your control and you originally told everyone that it is just a story...I don't know. But it is time to make amends. This book has been selling world wide (albeit, it failed dismally in Australia because there the people knew it was a bunch of hokey) since 1994 ~ next year it will be Twenty Years! Take the right action now and tell the world the truth. Stop misleading people.<br /><br />For anyone who has read this, I found the story an easy read with some nice lessons, but it is fiction and the Aboriginal People are attempting to survive a government that continues to legislate their demise. There are many tribes in the Outback and all of them wish to live and to continue their culture and traditions. Better to contribute to their cause by buying a book written by an Aborigine.oral, and it embarrasses me as an American and an author.<br /><br />The Indigenous People worldwide work diligently to promote understanding, peace, and awareness of the planet.

B0014D6PCO|5.0|BATMAN BEGINS, while not containing the brutal anarchy of THE DARK KNIGHT, nor the emotion and drama of THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, is perhaps the most entertaining and satisfying of Nolan's excellent trilogy, not to mention the most faithful to the comics.<br /><br />Let us examine what Nolan did right:<br /><br />The casting of [[ASIN:B004S5D3B6 Christian Bale]] as Bruce Wayne was a stroke of genius. Suave, charming, and attractive as the billionaire playboy, and menacing, terrifying, and brutal as the Batman, Bale (one of the most versatile and talented actors working today) carries the film with his weighty and brilliant performance. Bale conquers the physical aspect of Batman, and master the tortured psyche and persona of Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />Nolan surrounds Bale with an incredibly talented cast. [[ASIN:B004VFONHG Michael Caine]] is brilliant in his understated role as Alfred, Batman's loyal and often very wise butler. [[ASIN:B0079LJZG8 Gary Oldman]] is absolutely amazing as Lieutenant James Gordon, the one straight cop in the dodgy Gotham underworld. [[ASIN:B0013KTGAG Cillian Murphy]] oozes psychological menace as Dr. Jonathan Crane, a doctor with an obsession with fear, and an effective villain. [[ASIN:B00BP4X3W2 Liam Neeson]] makes a very effective and charismatic R'as Al Ghul. The only unfortunate bit of casting is [[ASIN:B000I9UA7Q Katie Holmes]] as Rachel Dawes, since she has neither the charm and attitude of Maggie Gylenhaal, nor the believability to be entirely effective. Look for [[ASIN:B000067J3S Tom Wilkinson]] in a scenery-chewing electrifying role, and [[ASIN:B001EBV0OY Morgan Freeman]] doing his awesome thing as Lucius Fox. If Christopher Nolan has one talent, it is putting together excellent casts.<br /><br />But do you know what I really like about BEGINS? Nolan. nailed. Gotham. While KNIGHT and RISES are undoubtedly excellent films, I felt the aspect of Gotham was underused. The Gotham of the comics is HELL on earth. Dark, ridden - no, decayed - with crime, corruption, crooked cops, gang lords, the mafia, and far, far, worse things. Old, drab, ugly buildings, cold hard people, a darkened sky... This is not the shining Metropolis of Superman, this is not Peter Parker's familiar New York, this is the backwater of all filth, a dirty, dark, cesspit of crime. Christopher Nolan REALLY brought that point across effectively and brilliantly. The subway, once a shining example of Wayne Industries, is old, rattly, and covered in graffiti. The night streets are dark and scary. This is Batman's element.<br /><br />And the other thing that sets BEGINS apart. Fear. As Wilkinson's crime boss says \\"Men always fear what they don't understand\\". Fear is both the reason that Batman exists and his greatest weapon. Fear created Batman, it transformed Bruce Wayne. It gives him drive and reason to live. Fear is one of the major themes of Nolan's first Batman film. Batman strikes fear with his terrifying costume and ninja-learned tactics. People learn to handle fear, and overcome their fear. The Scarecrow uses fear as a weapon. I felt that KNIGHT and RISES also dropped the ball slightly when it came to this aspect of the dark knight.<br /><br />The action is great. Neeson's swordfight with Bale early on in the film is excellently shot and acted. Batman's early fights perfectly capture his traditional fighting style: shadows, confusion, fear. Characters literally battle fear later on in the film, and the stakes are high, the fights are gritty and realistic, and the action is engaging. The Batmobile is set at it's most awesome mode of kickassery, too, so that's a plus.<br /><br />Let us see what else helped make Batman awesome again: Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's epic, bloodpumping score (dun DUN dun DUUUUUN!), the excellent production values, gritty costumes, realistic sets, and cinematography (I tell you that moment where Bruce Wayne sets out to find his destiny in the mountains is _stunning_ imagery). The lack of excessiveCGI grounds Batman in reality, but there is humour here, and it is funny. You may think that Nolan sacrifices heart for action, but that is not so. Bruce Wayne and James Gordon and Alfred become real, sympathetic characters in our eyes.<br /><br />The result? A film so awesome it will make you forget of the travesty that was Batman and Robin (Speak to me not of it! OH MY EYES THEY'RE BURNING NOT THE PUNS OH GOD!!). With an excellent cast, amazing cinematography, action, and drama, Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale craft what is perhaps the most enjoyable Batman film ever made. Begins gets almost everything right, and this is a movie that deserves to be seen multiple times.<br /><br />My rank? Five out of five Batarangs.<br /><br />P.S. Check out the sequel [[ASIN:B001OGWY1W The Dark Knight]], arguably the finest superhero film ever made. This is a brilliant film that leaps for the throat and does not let go. A memorable villain and excellent pacing make this the best of the bunch.<br />And the threequel [[ASIN:B009LRE040 The Dark Knight Rises]], a long, epic, weighty, emotionally powerful film that trades Batman onscreen for drama and characters.CGI grounds Batman in reality, but there is humour here, and it is funny.

0792839730|3.0|It's not &#34;THE LONGEST DAY&#34;!  Certainly a star-studded film and it was a pleasure to see Sean Connery in a role other than James Bond.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is a good game lots of quizzes and fun I recommend this to anyone who loves a good challenge
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book = amazing! I'm so hooked on this book series! This is the second time I've read this book and I love it more and more I re-read it! On to the next book ;) City of Fallen Angels
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I absolutely love this game!!! The only two things I didn't like about it, was 1 - I think there should be unlimited play. 2 - there is not an option for an avatar with red hair. Other than those things I think that this is an awesome game that everyone in the family will love!
B002OSXDAU|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Atlas Shrugged and had not read the Fountainhead so I gave it a try.  While the character development was excellent and the underlying plot was good, I found the emphasis on the emotional trauma (read frustrated love) to be over done. Having said that I suspect that it would probably hold higher appeal to individuals more concerned with the human emotion than on the consequences of actions.<br />I also found the finale somewhat predictable but not really believable.<br />Regardless, a great lesson from a great writer that can have value to today's society.<br />The kind of book that will never be allowed on any public school reading list.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesome game and you cannot put your device down after you start playing it!!!! Great graphics, and has great mental skills too. I absolutely love this app will never put it down!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is a nice games<br />hi this is Connor sisters coming to you live<br />I love temple run 2 games
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I love this book, the ONLY downside is that it isn't very long. Aside from that, this book is awesome, the author makes it very understandable, and I feel like I know the characters, this book is well worth what I paid.
B008JFLWLE|2.0|Good app &quot;if&quot; you do not want to do algebra. This app will not accept variables such as 2+x=12. The &quot;x&quot; is seen by the app as multiplication. I tried using &quot;c&quot; which the app took to mean &quot;(&quot; or &quot;1&quot;.
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|If you are a fan of the Priest, this is the DVD for you!<br />- Halford's voice has never been better. Even Painkiller is up to snuff here.<br />- Newbie guitarist Ritchie Faulkner is so amazing that you hardly miss KK.<br />- Ian Hill's bass is actually audible at several moments.<br />- Guitarist Glenn Tipton hardly breaks a sweat as he destroys the fret board.<br />- And you even get a little drum solo from Scott!
B00BLSJI80|4.0|Demi Lovato has one of the best voices of the era. You can automatically tell it's her, and she has incredible range. I love almost every song on this album. Usually there are like three or so songs on an album that bore me and I never listen to after the first listening. But on this album, I find myself liking every one. Some stand-outs are:<br /><br />- Heart Attack<br />- Made in the USA<br />- Neon Lights<br />- Fire Starter<br />- Warrior<br /><br />She's got a good mix of emotions, which is great. Overall, it's a fantastic album and I don't regret one cent of it.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Quite interesting!  Keeps the brain very active. It is entertaining.  Can be used to occupy the mind while in transit. I truly enjoy playing.
B009O07NDY|4.0|Howard Shore manages to capture everything Middle-Earth and its stories are in a beautiful, moving, and exciting way. I cannot tell you how many emotions this album (along with Lord of the Rings) give me. Do give it a shot!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I know this is supposed to be a kid's movie,  but the adults were laughing harder.  Especially the beginning.  My son loves it and it was great to watch together.  The seller did a really good job. Came in new packaging and shipping time was very short. Maybe two days? It was perfect.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|GREAT APP. I HAVEN'T PUT IT DOWN THE LAST FEW DAYS. WISH I COULD UPGRADE FASTER BUT IT STILL HAS MY UNDIVIDED ATTENTION. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANY LEVEL GAMER.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Wow, it really  is mesmerizing. Makes History Channels Vikings seem tame. Lots of shocks, don't get comfortable with any character
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The twists and turns continue. Just when you think that they think they've got the problem, any problem, under control something gets twisted against them and once again they must assume the defense.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I use the Sena Bluetooth system on my motorcycle helmet.  The Sena drives earbuds fine, but does not have enough volume for helmet speakers in a noisy V Twin environment.  This tiny little Fios amp does the trick.  I put stick on Velcro on the back of the Fios and a matching Velcro patch on the Helmet next to the Sena Bluetooth.  The Fios looks pretty cool, stays securely on the helmet, but can be pulled off for charging.  Solved my problem inexpensively.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is possibly the best book in the genre I've ever read. I Can't wait to see what happens next!
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|not the best or worst game ever... it is a game after all. Give it a try if it is free.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|This is a movie based on a cartoon meant for kids... So there is no point in expecting a good plot or well written characters. If you want compelling story and great acting, go watch Little Miss Sunshine or Inception or one of those movies that are meant to have a complex and developed plot. If you want lots of gun fights, crazy ninja action and convincing CGI... This is the movie for you. Just watch it for the action and take it what this movie is meant to do.... Entertain you!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|this is a great app to have on you kindle. you always have an easy way to get information when you need it.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Tesla, a prolific inventor with a recognized contribution to the development of alternating current, has a place in popular history that is far beneath the significance of his inventions.  This book focuses on his inventions, and discusses his preference for work in his lab rather than battling challengers claiming invention rights.  This is a quick read with salient points about an interesting and important figure.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|You can't just jump from fifty years of police procedurals straight into The Wire, Oz, and Breaking Bad--you need a show that transitions you neatly from protagonist worship to antagonist worship.  Many of the conventions of precinct ensemble dramas live on in The Shield, and the show feels slightly dated a decade after its inception, but this show's writing is utterly unconventional with respect to treating its audience like adults, even if not all characters in it seem to qualify for that designation.  I am looking forward to the remaining seasons!
014241493X|5.0|This book was required reading for my daughter for her summer reading project. I decided to read it as well. It captured my interest and I found it very interesting!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Good writing and excellent acting. Definitely keeps your interest. I had seen it when it was originally broadcast, but it's enjoyable a second time.
B009WUBERW|3.0|One liners. Action. Guns. Good cast of characters. It sort of lost its novelty from the first one. But worth a watch if you are bored.
B00821OX98|5.0|Really well-written and well done. Character development is outstanding. Did not see this as it originally aired on television. Watched Season One in less than a week and am now into Season Two. Enjoying it immensely.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Writer does a good job of creating and describing this world without using thousands of pages to do it. I recommend it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I enjoy every second of this show and exploring the details of the lives of all of the characters. I'm fascinated by the difference in the lifestyles of all of the people in the early 1900's compared with our lifestyles today.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|star gatevis a classical movie that I just love I'll have to watch it over and over.... James Spader is so good in this
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoy this show and all the different characters that they expose.  It's a great look into how all the different social classes interacted and lived together during the early 1900's in England.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The book could have been more climatic, and could have closed some side stories less quickly, but it was a great read. Thank you Mr Jordan it was a great ride.Sanderson I will check out your original work. you have much toh
B002GAR3AM|5.0|Sexy woman; stylish attire; interesting stories; I didn't like all the character, but that's standard; we all have our favorites!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a great book, sad , but a love story that will draw one in. It is never boring and moves one right along in the characters lives.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I played this a bunch online, and now they finally ported it to the Kindle. It works great and is addictively fun.
B0012CJQY6|5.0|Liked seeing the character development of all the many characters in the show. Plus, liked the introduction of Glenn Close and Forest Whitaker.
B0090SI4LU|4.0|Even though it was not like the book, I liked the movie.  It was romantic with some action. They did leave out some important parts that were in the book. But I liked it and recommend it.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Easy to play. Good time waster and easy scoring. No problems on kindle fire HD. Reviews have to be long.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Not an extremely large fan of the Alien genre, but the price was attractive, the storyline new to me on the last movie. The quality was OK b/c remastered from older resoutions.  All-in-all very entertaining.
B007HVBW2A|1.0|I'm a fan of older horror movies, and honestly..I've never seen The Exorcist before in my almost 30 years of life.  However...this one was a bore for me.  It was hard to keep paying attention, and I was unable to finish the movie due to the slow plot.
B00BOXZAG6|3.0|I didn't read every other review, so possibly someone else has already mentioned this, BUT -- did Mr. Solanas even CONSIDER the fact that planets need to SPIN to create gravity? Pretty remedial stuff. The only way to physically connect celestial bodies is if one is in geosynchronous orbit around another.<br /><br />That being said, and suspending ALL scientific disbelief, and categorizing this film as a complete FABLE (which is perfectly fine by me), I did enjoy it. Once the viewer takes a gigantic leap of faith and decides to let go and view this movie on a purely visceral level, the ride is pleasant and clever. I don't regret purchasing it, although I prefer sci-fi to be grounded in, at the very least, scientific THEORY - and fantasy to have strong mythical roots.<br /><br />I must, however, sadly agree with a number of other reviews presented here that the 3D process here is VERY poorly executed; almost non-existent. I should have saved the half-dozen bucks or so, and just got the regular Blu-Ray.
B0040JHWKS|4.0|Definitely enjoyed the proto versions of these Springsteen classics. Will definitely wear these CDs out. Not just another remaster of the more common boot legged performances.
B00ABOU794|4.0|Enjoyed all the songs, but think they could have added a couple of my favorites from the season that were missing.
B001QB9H10|4.0|Nice flow, great action & pretty good story. This third movie of transporter series looses no steam. Good chemistry between Statham & love interest.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed the entire book until the last page.....it leaves you hanging, you have to decide how it ends and I still don't know:(
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love minecraft so i purchased the Xbox version, it has so much more, the computer version has more than that, this seems more of a demo then the game itself, the creative inventory is tiny, but it is still a great game, don't get me wrong there, but very small compared to Xbox or pc.
B007SGM084|1.0|Redundant, redundant, redundant....poor writing, more of the same on every page.  Predictable and I fast forwarded every page with the ridiculous sex and hoped to find a storyline or anything redeeming<br />!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I really like this game. I wish there were more hints. I pretty welled stuck right now and know one will help me.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Saw the Dude's for the first time in 1975 plus or minus a year playing Vol 4. Kudo's to Rick Rubin for getting the all in studio at one time or another. I'm critically disabled now or I would have dropped $539.00 for a single seat to see them at the Irvine outdoor Ampitheater 6th row from the stage in good old So Cali. My review? U either like Sabbath or you do not. God Bless Ronnie James Dio RIP either way to see these guys perform will give you a heightened awareness as to how Heavy Metal Started.<br />Peace Out, B

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Paraphrasing spoiler alert (not really): Gideon : I want you Eva, I cant live without you, I own you, lets have mind blowing sex. That was great, now Im going to leave and be super secretive and not tell you anything and make sure I hang out with my super sexy ex-fianc&eacute;.  Im going to have private lunch meetings with lipstick on my collar and not tell you whats up and sneak away in the middle of the night and not answer any of your calls. So lets fight and not solve any of our issues with sex.<br /><br />Eva: Oh yes, I love you. Lets do couples therapy. I think it will be great because I love to be walked all over and pushed around. But wait... Im better than this. Ummm.... never mind, I love you. Wait, why dont you tell me a little bit about yourself since I only know the size of your penis. Never mind, Im good. So lets start a fight and never solve or talk about any of our problems and just have sex instead.<br /><br />This book infuriated, enraged, aggravated and exasperated me. It pushed me to my patience limit and sucked me back in. I absolutely love it when a book can do that to me. Day has been holding this piece of sweet cake in front of me through Bared to You and now Reflected in You and I finally got to lick off some of the icing.<br />Ok, so here it is. Even though I finally got a taste of the icing, I still have A LOT of unanswered questions. Maybe Im not such a forgiving person like Eva seems to be. Speaking of little miss Eva. She has quickly become one of the TSTL characters for me. Sometimes I wish I could jump in the book and smack that girl on the back of the head.  Dont get me wrong Gideon deserves a good pummeling  too. Just not the kind of pummeling that Eva would have gladly given him. The first 75%ish of this book does nothing but piss me off and turns into hot sex. Seriously... thats it. There was a lot of repeating and it felt like page filler to me.<br /><br />But... oh! The last 15%ish of the book! FINALLY! This is what Ive been waiting for! My little slice of Gideon secret cake. Give it to me! Oh and he did and he didnt disappoint. I would have liked more explanation as to where that lipstick came from and more info on some of the key players. Oh and if I were Eva I would have scratched Corinne's eyes out! And where did all this \\"trust\\" all the sudden come from? Well, overall I liked it and will continue to read the series.or! My little slice of Gideon secret cake. Give it to me!
