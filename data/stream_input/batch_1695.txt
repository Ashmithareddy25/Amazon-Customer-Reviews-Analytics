B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This one is great.  I am having a lot of fun and can spend just a couple of minutes a day if that is what the scedual allows.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Original? Every idea in the movie was trite, and unoriginal! We get the young male protagonist who loses beloved family member at a very young age then goes seeking revenge on the Evil that took her. There goes young Abe, he's going to try to kill the bad-guy now. Watch. Here comes the vampire. Vampire makes vampire faces and looks dangerous. Abe tries to run. There's going to be a random dead body to prove how evil the Evil is. Abe loses fight because he's young and untrained. Here comes Mentor to save him at the last minute. Mentor will be a drunk and reprobate with nothing to live for until his protege shows up, the ONLY one on earth who can save the world and the mentor from himself. Cue Revelation. Cue Training Montage...  Protagonist goes out to kill Evil alone, then finds out his Mentor is not everything he claimed/ betrayed him with lies. Protagonist goes in opposite direction of mentor and by rebelling, excels .... zzzsnortspffffhhhhttthhh...<br /><br />Oh, sorry, I fell asleep.<br /><br />Save your money and your time. Skip this pedestrian, hackneyed redux of every movie ever made by Hollywood in the last 30 years. Even the vampires weren't that scary. You can predict every single scene if you've seen more than 1-movie in the past 5 years.
B0045EA1P6|3.0|Its an Ok album it lacks the hyde that created fun. startum. I would consider this album if I needed to listen to upbeat music without to much content.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  It's exciting, emotional, wonderfully written and carries these qualities up until the very last page.  I can not recommend it enough to anyone who enjoys reading.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Must have for Kindle Fire.  Folds nicely to stand.  Very high quality and confident it will protect Kindle.  Wipes clean easily.

B0089BSOPA|4.0|This is an underestimated sequel due to success of first Halloween,but its a nice little film under it`s own merits.Worth a look,I`m sure you`ll enjoy Donald Pleasance & Jamie Lee Curtis they come up to scratch.Dvd set (2discs) has orig theatrical version & not seen Tv version + a brand new documentary & 2 film commentaries,one by producer Rick Rosenthal.Get it.Peter A.
B009WJX10G|1.0|This episode has to be the worst thing the series has ever done. No one tunes into SN to watch a bad home video with no talent actors and actresses -acting out a badly written story. It was painful.<br /><br />I overlook the misogyny and total boys club attitude of this show because good supernatural thrillers are far and few between, add in they have killed off Ellen and Bobby, who gave the boys their family-base and then they took out the rock music and then the car for an entire year. L really thought last season was AWFUL, but this, this makes last season look like a diamond.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|I personally do not like much of Tim Burton's work, even though he only helped produce this film, but I must say A++...a very well written and produced film with great acting, great special effects and great action. Timur Bekmambetov is now one of my favorite directors. An excellent film with a \\"new\\" up-to-date twist with the vampire genre that I will watch over and over. If you LOVE vampires, watch this film. You will not be disappointed.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|Love the game, a bit bothered that the free version on the Play Store gets updated before the paid versions on the Amazon app store. Not sure whose fault it is, but unacceptable either way!
B008NW67E0|5.0|I adore Mumford & Sons.  They have a sound all their own.  I loved Sigh No More, and I love this one, too, though they are very different albums.  I love the spiritual undertones in every song.  I love the Banjo.  I love the guitars.  I love the almost mountain-music feel to the music.  I love Marcus Mumford's voice.  In other words, this album rocks!  \m/

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one great book, I couldn't stop myself from reading it. You will not be disappointed if you choose to read it.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|It may not measure up to other Pixar movies , but it's still an amazing movie. I can see why some people may not like it because it's similar to another Disney movie (Brother Bear). However, I think the movie was cute and the animation was stunning.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story was riveting.  even though i had seen the movie ,  the characters were more complex than the movie portrayed
B009IKPOUO|5.0|Beautiful songs,,,too long to finally be made public! Cannot wait for many more upcoming volumes to be added! This lady can sing anything!!! RELEASE IT ALL!!! The vaults are obviously FULL!!!
1451627297|4.0|I have not been a great Stephen King fan, generally finding his work about a half pound too long. I am however more of a great sci-fi fan than horror genre and this book really hits the spot. You know that it is about time travel from the git-go but the modus operendi in this case was unlike any I have seen before. The parameters to access the time portal and the contrariness of its application are marvelous, inventive and frustrating to the reader and to the characters in the book. This is a compendium of love stories, in that love is what motivates the main character throughout his epic struggles. While the love of a man for a woman is at the heart, it is also love of country and love of fellow man. Much of Jake Eppings' time is invested in determining whether a man really deserves to die. He pursues this noble endeavor with far more perseverance  than most of us ever would.
B008RYN44U|2.0|... if you were to compare No Doubt's latest work to other bands that have turned more towards Pop, I feel they missed the mark. The record is full of too many ballads and frankly, I never viewed No Doubt as the type to push ballads over fun, upbeat songs.<br /><br />Gwen has a unique quality and tone to her voice and very few songs showcase her talent. So if you rate her perfomance against others in the genre it falls flat. In my opinion, they strayed too far from the musical arrangements that shaped why this band had such a following.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait until Entwined With You comes out. I absolutely love this series, I even got my sisters hooked :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book. I have both the digital and paperback copies of this book. I hope you enjoy this as much as me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am in my fifties and I usually like word games but this was recommended and I absolutely love it. It really pays to start at the beginning levels so that you become accustomed to the game.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|At first I was kinda bummed that I could not watch this show due to not having HBO.  But what's better than having HBO?  Being able to watch all the episodes back to back, marathon style.  I love how the show stays true to the vampire myths.
B0030Y11XS|1.0|Another steaming piece of garbage by every liberal's favorite commie-loving hypocrite.And when I say hypocrite.I mean just that.Mr.Moore likes to fool the masses of middle class people with his phony \\"Blue Collar,Working Man Image\\",but I bet he would never admit to all the billions of dollars that he's got stashed away.He's probally rolling in more dough than you could ever imagine.Alot more than he likes to try and make people believe.Unfortunatly,people ARE believing it...ESPECIALLY the left,of course.When's the last time you heard of Mr.Moore giving to any charities?? If he hates capitalism so much,which gives us the freedom to make our OWN choices,without the government sticking their noses in our business,and if he loves SOCIALISM so much,which tells us what and what we CANNOT DO,than how come he doesn't spread HIS wealth around??? Liberals ALWAYS like to accuse conservatives,of what THEY'RE guilty of.... Everytime. I thought this was the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and not RUSSIA. Hmmm...
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Ive stopped watching the shows weekly on TV just so I can watch the whole season at my own pace.  Love being able to do so.  The story line and plot on season 4 is amazing.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This the secret to The Secret!   I found myself not able to sustain the momentum of positive thinking, manifestation or pivoting my thoughts and feelings until i read this book!! i have finally found my joy and heart felt gratitude in life without the intent  to win the powerball! Thank you, Thank you,Thank you!!!!
B007704HO6|4.0|This is a lovely story and illustrates well the hardships experienced living a \\"street life\\".  Anyone who loves animals will love this book.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think we have seen way to much games that have the same concept as this and it completely unrealistic but it is fun
B0074VTHKM|4.0|T. Boone has a very mature personality for his age.  Probably having both parents working lawyers and having an office of his own at their firm, makes him more mature (on some level) than his peers. His peers always want to know what he's \\"working on\\".  Makes me wonder if the author has plans for a follow-on when this character is a Law Student or later when he's an Intern with a law firm. It is a fast-moving book and an easy read.
B004QK5N5W|1.0|Tried this on both ipad2 and ipad3. The video is very grainy when playing. However the product is totally unusable as within a few minutes of using it the ipad wireless network connection becomes extremely slow/stops working. Did not work on the ipad1 at all.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|(Spoiler)Well since readers decided to share their likes and dislikes, I decided to share mine as well. I am a huge Fifty Shades of Grey fan. I loved all three books. Granted, this is fantasy NOT real life, nope, that just doesn't happen. Having said that, this Bared to you, Reflected in You series I read thinking it would carry on the same lines of the Fifty Shades trilogy. It's like a copycat for me. The names were changed to protect Christian and Ana! The two main characters worked my ever loving nerves. I put the 2nd book down a couple of times the woman whined and whined and the secrets (that were not revealed) geeze...tiring!<br /><br />MY greatest disappointment was the Gideon murders Nathan (who raped Eva in her youth. Granted Nathan needed to pay, but it was not Gideon's call. You don't just murder someone and walk away like, \\"Ok, that's done!\\" I was really disappointed in that step. Both characters were slightly if not definitely psychotic in my opinion.<br /><br />Bottom line, it was more irritating than enjoyable.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie, great quality picture on Blu-Ray.  Excellent price point, much cheaper than anywhere else. Love it.  Case has cool hologram cover.
B003XUKVXK|5.0|There is only one thing to say about this recording: I listen to it every day of my life, and have done so since the day it arrived in the mail two years ago. It is THAT good!!
B009329ZF2|4.0|Don't read or listen to the majority of reviews. This movie has some of the coolest weaponry and CGI effects of any I have seen. I particularly liked the aliens \\"hands\\". The story line isn't terrible. The characters are reasonably developed and can be related with. The battleship ending I'll agree was a little hokey but if you just enjoy the good human versus horrible alien confrontation put the game out of your mind. After all, the Earth was saved again!!!

B00910Y1OQ|4.0|The game is a lot of fun and i have played through all the levels once and k am halfway through a second time.  I am disappointed by two things.  One: there is not a continuous mode that you can play the levels continuously.  Two:  the extras button does not have any extras on it.  It only has ways you can advertise the game such as &quot;Give us 5 stars&quot; or share this app with your friends on Facebook and twitter.  These are not extras, that is advertising.

B003G4W49C|4.0|Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game details humanity fighting for its place in the universe against a force they don't understand.  The intelligence of younger generations is honed and seen as their only hope of salvation.  That hope soon forms itself into a small boy called Ender, who must deal with the weight of the people of Earth on his shoulders.<br /><br />The Summary<br /><br />Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin is a young boy of six when he is recruited to go to battle school.  He leaves behind his compassionate and intelligent sister Valentine and his malevolent-genius brother Peter, not to mention parents that play little role in his life.  At battle school, he endures training meant to prepare him to save the human race from the alien Buggers, with whom humanity is at war.  Through various trials, Ender is faced with hardship and overcomes each problem with a cunning solution.<br /><br />As Ender ages, the Bugger war advances, and it becomes more apparent that humanity is counting on him as a savior.  Also revealed is the extent to which Ender's life has been manipulated.  The book comes to a crescendo when Ender is in his early teens.  He and the friends he has made at battle school must put to the test what they have learned in order to prepare for saving humanity - if they can make it in time.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />Ender is an admirable main character that you can't help but root for.  Again and again, he is forced to deal with things that no one should deal with, much less a little boy.  Time after time, though, he comes through.  The intelligence of children in this future world scenario is a very good thing to hope for.  If only our children become the smarter and quicker of our race, then we will keep advancing.<br /><br />The book is dull to me at some points because of all the military influence.  It isn't bad, but I have a distaste for anything that involves military references.  I know that armies and such are often great things, I just often don't care to read about them.<br /><br />The \\"big reveal\\" in the book is surprising, but I half-expected it to happen.  Others that have read the book I know have reported that it was stunning and amazing, but it did not leave me baffled.  It was a very good twist, nonetheless.<br /><br />I would recommend Ender's Game based on a number of things.  It is a good book, well written and marvelously put together.  It is an excellent sci-fi tale and takes a great look at humanity and our future.  I would advise people that this is definitely a book worth reading, but reserve the right to say that it will effect everyone differently.  I also think it has a different effect on males, as they have the experience of growing up as a little boy, whereas I do not.<br /><br />For more book reviews, visit [...]care to read about them.<br /><br />The \\"big reveal\\" in the book is surprising, but I half-expected it to happen.

0553103547|5.0|After hearing about the tv series and watching a few episodes, I decided to pick up the books. This book is great its a big hardcover novel. The plot, characters, and everything else is amazing in itself and is very well written I would recommend this to almost anyone looking for a good read.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|I couldn't give 5 stars because a lot of time was spent outlining the authors previous Seal experience and training. I had already read Man Hunt by Peter Bergen which gave most of the details of the raid to kill OBL. This book just filled in the bits missed in Man Hunt.<br /><br />I liked the fact that the author repeatedly emphasised the fact that the killing of OBL was a Team effort.<br /><br />A very worthwhile read for anyone interested in Military matters
B007THA4FI|5.0|I thought this book was amazing. I read all the HP books and loved them.  Rowling is an amazing  writer.  She knows how to bring her character's to life  whether you like them or not.  I loved the fact that it was nothing like her previous books. It was extremely intelligent and insightful.  This book was not about the best in people but the worst in people.  It was very honest and sometimes harsh. A lot of people will not like this book because of the very nasty small  minded characters she writes about. But thats what makes this book so good.  Whether we like it or not the people in this book and the things that happen to them exist everyday and every where in our world.  This was a great book!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|If you have an opportunity to see Marvel's the Avengers, do so.  Not only does this film have a great storyline, but also incredible special effects.  The cast is excellent, the action is non-stop, and it will be well worth the price.  If you have Blu-ray, you will definitely have more little bells and whistles for your viewing pleasure, but definitely get this movie.  It's worth it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved all three books. It was Definitely a page turner. Hope there is a fourth one, if so cant wait.
6304493681|4.0|The plot of this first \\"Ghost In The Shell\\" (GITS) movie takes a different direction than the series (Stand Alone Complex; S.A.C.) setting up an important plot element in the second GITS movie, \\"GITS 2: Innocence\\". Although the animation of this first movie is striking for its clarity and attention to detail, it does not rise to the level of the stunningly beautiful \\"Ghost in the Shell 2:Innocence\\". [[ASIN:B0006A9FMI Ghost in the Shell 2 - Innocence]]<br /><br />Having said that, this GITS movie is the first time the creators devoted this amount of uninterrupted time to the things that make this franchise special: (1) As I stated above, the animation is crisp and the attention to detail is unfailing; yes (2) the creators use futuristic technology to enhance the characters' physicality and ability to use violence (\\"action\\"). But most importantly, (3) a well-crafted, well-written story was not abandoned or sacrificed on the altar of graphics/visuals. The crimes investigated by the members of \\"Section 9\\" are complex. This story, like all the GITS stories, is crafted on different \\"levels\\".  At one level, they're crime dramas,reminiscent of an episode of \\"Law & Order\\". There are plot twists and exchanges of dry humor between the characters.<br /><br />At a deeper level, these stories are immersed in the \\"deep politics\\" of the fictional place and (future) time in which they occur. Likewise, they are immersed in the theme upon which the concept of GITS rests; asking the viewer one question: \\"In (this vision of) a future where mechanical, computerized enhancement is the norm, what does it mean to be 'human'?\\"
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this regularly, especially for todo lists when I'm running around. It would bee nice to see integration with calendar apps and stronger voice operation, but that will grow in time. In the mean time I find that I use it regularly and that's what counts for an app.

B009NQKXYK|2.0|I couldn't wait for it to be over and in the end I felt like it was a waste of my time and money. This is supposed to be the prelude to Aliens which didn't really emerge until the last quarter of the story. Character and set design was pretty good but the amount of action and adventure didn't meet my needs.
B003B02O14|5.0|Traditional Grisham story line. A good young lawyer trapped in a corrupt firm making a break for a new life. Overcoming many barriers, he triumphs with quick witted legal gymnastics.  Some how he makes it new & different each time. The ending however, is very non-grisham. Disappointing at first because it breaks with the expected, it's ironic twist becomes more appreciated as Grisham moves toward reality. The result of age, wisdom & maturity?<br />If you like Grishham, you will not be disappointed.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was not the ending I had imagined. Katniss was too confused and out of the loop for most of the book. Then the end was disappointingly melancholy.

030758836X|5.0|Intoxicating novel, bitter brain-teaser and mind-bender!!! LOVED IT!!!  Enough said...a must read. I actually liked the ending..because in my mind I know how 'anymore' of the novel would have played out...would be great if the author were to write a sequel!

B007ZXK08C|4.0|This novel keeps you page turning.  It is about a dysfunctional married couple and the murder of the wife.  Some strange dysfunctional others, like parents and friends and just others.  The author should keep better company!!But then she is Irish and at least we Irish are happy dysfuntionals.<br />You feel the depressed atmosphere of Carthage and the areas around it.  Does this have an effect on people?  The Mighty Miss flows through the novel and is ever present.<br />The construction of the novel works very well eventhough I originally felt it wouldn't.<br /><br />This is more than an ordinary thriller; it deals with people and how we cope.  The differnces between men and women, while greatly exaggerated in the novel, makes you think about relationships. I could see this novel being used to train people in counselling and understanding of human relations.<br /><br />You have seen couples like this; they are addicted to each others faults as if \\"my faults don't seem too bad when I see yours up close\\"<br />I hear Ms R. Widderspoon has bought the film rights.  Smart girl!!  Not just a pretty face.  I look forward to the film.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I just finished level 3, and I HAD to post a review. This is such a quick and manageable workout. I actually only did this DVD five days a week, and just extended the workout to six weeks. I was already in decent shape, and I did not do the diet, but I really noticed a huge difference in my arms and abs in particular. Perhaps more objectively, I saw a 30 second improvement in my mile time when I went for a run the other day. I haven't run at all since I started this program, so that is saying a lot.<br /><br />I just wanted to let people know that doing this program only five days a week for 6 weeks totally works. I am sure there are other people out there like me who hate working out every day!
0980876702|5.0|\\"Home Sweet Home\\" is a beautiful hand embroidery project, incorporating a vast variety of stitches and techniques.  The book includes excellent written and illustrative instructions along with fabulous photography.  This is not a project for the faint-hearted, but with perseverance, the needleworker will end up with an heirloom quality piece of which he or she can be very proud.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|\\"Awesome Wave\\" is a truly unique experience and Alt-J creates a sound that I have never heard before nor could compare to any other contemporary band.  Four times through on this record I don't understand the lyrics but can't stop listening to the harmonics and amazing beats and rhythms generated by the three-piece.  Highly recommend this album- especially to anyone who is interested in something new and different.  One of the most creative albums of 2012 and will not be surprised to see their name on a number of music mag lists at the end of the year.
B008NABUU8|5.0|I don't quite understand folks who complain about a game being &quot;too challenging&quot;.  This is a game based entirely on physics: Its SUPPOSED to be challenging!  Instead of giving the game a bad review, try giving your high school physics teacher a bad review!  I love everything about the puzzles.  I can spend hours trying to figure out cost-saving designs to best my own record.  The play style reminds me quite a bit of the game &quot;world of goo&quot; in that, while some levels are quite challenging, they can be made ever more so if you want the extra points. The 3D is amazing...I guess some slower machines can't quite handle it...so perhaps a lower-res option would benefit the makers.  It runs perfect on my HP Touchpad (Android CM9).  Thank you Clockstone! Can't wait to check out your other stuff....

1451648537|5.0|I didn't want to like this book, because I reject needlessly abrasive management styles. But the first computer I ever programmed on (in good old Basic language) was a brand new black & green-screen Apple IIe in about 1983.  I immensely enjoyed learning the backstory to the long series of products that have touched the lives of so many of us.  Some highlights: details surrounding the iPod and iPhone, building the Next Computer (a very gorgeous machine that I played on once for about 3 hours), the Mac and Toy Story.<br /><br />There is a lot to learn from Jobs and a lot of it is here. I just hope we have not spawned a whole generation of tyrannical jerks who think they are mini-Steves.  He was able to succeed with huge reserves of talent, energy and luck - he won in spite of his flaws, not because of them.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very good book.  I could not put it down!  The characters are very intriguing.  I read all 3 books in a couple days.
1439153663|2.0|This novel contains very little in the way of historical or cultural background; the characters are insufficiently developed; and the dialogue could have come from day-time television soap operas--found it really quite boring and hard to finish.  Sorry, but definitely don't agree with 3, 4 and 5 star reviews.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is a great book. The first half is a little repetitive, and I had trouble wading through a few of the parts about the extensive training of the Navy Seals. Beginning in the middle of the book, when they first start planning the Bin Laden mission, Not an Easy Day becomes a real page turner. I couldn't put it down. The true story of this mission, as told in this book, is a lot different than the story we got from the news media.
B008XG1X18|5.0|most of the awesome gifts i give or projects that i do come from this site. definitely a must for anyone who likes to be crafty.

In this day and age, it seems like people are making names for themselves out of an image that they can't keep up with, corrupted by television, radio and peers will make it hard for the New generation to be themselves.<br /><br />Kendrick sees that and put it into his first major label album. Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City is a cry for help in my opinion, and he faced life as he knew it (and most of us know it) in a way that all urban city affiliates can relate to.<br /><br />Kendrick tackles 2 things in my opinion: the troubles of today's youth AND the trouble with today's music. As he tells his flawless story of being in the city of Compton, he also manages a very eclectic score to compliment the scenes as they shift, giving YOU, the listener, a more broader vision of the picture he painting with his wordplay at these moments of conflict, which is why every song (whether you love or just \\"like\\" it) is A+ material.<br /><br />Artists and recordings like this are far and few between, but it takes a person like Kendrick who understands the history of Hip Hop music, do to the upbringing of family playing Hip Hop as a child, and he also understands the things people in his age group face by observation and experience. Kendrick is on a mission to save music and lives at the same time, and by the way he executed Good Kid, M.A.A.D. city, he's just the young man for the job.<br /><br />5 out of 5
B005FISBTO|5.0|Another great season of one of the best shows on TV.  Never dull, some interesting twists, and has excellent callbacks from previous seasons. Simply love this show!
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I'm a huge muse fan and will buy their music without first listening to it.When i popped this cd in i was blown away!!They really have perfected their own unique sound.They can rock,they can tone it down to a dreamy ballad,bellamy is an awesome pianist.Alot of bands today sound similar but these guys keep their creativity on the cutting edge.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This seasons starts and end with a rush. It kept me at the edge of my seat. If you are like me that thinks zombies are cheesy.. You are going to be proven wrong. I had my doubts but this series changed my mind......watch it now!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After I got past the first book (Fifty Shades of Grey), I thought the story line was good.  However, I do think this book is more for mature readers.  I can't say that I would want my teenager reading these books  If theses books are made into a movie, I can't imagine how the movie would be rated.  All I can really say is that the author definitely had a vivid imagination or else had personal experience.
B00068TJM6|5.0|By far the coolest Seiko that I own. This watch has a lot of high end features that make it seem like it should cost twice as much. Solid stainless steel machined bracelet with solid end links, 200m water resistance with screw-down crown and pushers, and a domed hardlex crystal all add to the overall quality of the watch. The movement is also very functional. The chronograph function is able to measure split time so that you can time two separate events at once. The alarm subdial can be set to a second timezone when the alarm is disengaged, making this a GMT watch. Also, important note - Amazon has this watch listed as having a case diameter of 44mm. Not true - it is around 42mm. If you are looking for a fun watch at a great price, pull the trigger and give the Seiko SNA411 a shot.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the series very much. It kept me very interested. It was hard to put them down. Awesome read.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|had a good time playing. tried to access the sneek peek for part 2 and haven't seen any news yet...
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This is a great app. I have to get up at different times every day and setting and resetting my alarm gets annoying. The fact that this gives you the option to set several at a time is awesome and so much easier for me. No more forgetting to reset the alarm. My only issue, which is why I gave it 4 stars, is I wish it was a little louder. I don't  know if that could just be user error tho! ;)
B008AX1HD8|4.0|I have read all the Harry Hole series and whereas I read this one second last in the series, I enjoyed it the most. More variety, not quite so bleak and lots of twists and turns. A great read
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|spoiler alert: I got this at like five in the morning and had it done by noon. I Loved it! it was much more serious than the other books. part of that was probably the divide between the Greeks and the Romans and Annabeths moms lunacy. I kind of liked that because the previous books were kind of flippant with all the mortal peril. I thought the part where Percy and Annabeth sneak out and are discovered. I didnt like all the grudges between leo and frank and jason and percy. though its inevitable. the showdown with arachne is beast and i like how Annabeth uses her brains to beat her. do boys always have to be so stupid?(i meant that in a good way). Rick Riordan rocks! i cant wait for the House of Hades.k
B00846REIS|1.0|Sorry to say I didn't and couldn't get passed the second chapter. It played out like some high school girls fantasy. I guess I thought it might be interesting to read for a change of pace, but was sadly mistaken. To think that women are all just walking around unfulfilled until the most amazing man comes along and wants only them is not only ridiculous but its an insult to ones intelligence.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|One of our favorite television shows.  The season ends with a cliff-hanger with Dean paying the debt made earlier.  Overall a good season with only a couple of \\"off\\" episodes.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|just like the show. love story line and who done it. Heat is tough gal that don't let anything get passed her. will read the the rest of the books!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I truly enjoy this game. I play it on my phone and now on my new fire.  It is an awesome hidden object game.  All the quests and having to buy coins and diamonds is ridiculous.  At the very least they should give this info in the game description.  This is NOT a free game.
030758836X|2.0|Well written but the two main characters are so unlikeable that it is hard to care what happens to them.  There are some unusual twists that are not believable and I had to force myself to finish it. Such unlovely weirdos.<br />I downloaded this book on my Kindle.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|It's like video crack, really fun to play and good for the kids too. Gets a little hard on the higher levels so stays challenging
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I know the history of this period, but Philippa Gregory does it again. She makes the history come to life and you cannot put this book down. It just seems like you are in England wittnessing the actual events of that time. I really enjoyed this read.
B008XG1X18|4.0|love it... Have some issues on my Kindle Fire but it is by far my fsav app on my phone and kindle!!!
B008NABUU8|3.0|Fun game. But you have to have pencil fingers to see what you are building. And very slow between levels.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Works great on my Galaxy Sll. Had a flat on the interstate, and was more than enough light to change the tire @ 1:30 in the morning. Also made me visible to traffic. Also screen light works great when coming in the house at night. No need to turn on house lights and bother wife.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Should of had a better ending! other than that awesome book well written! I couldn't put it down a must read!! :)
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|wish it was easier to play without friends help, that part i could live without.  not like original versions of game has that facebook game feel but still overall enjoyable.
1476712042|5.0|This is on my favorite book list right now and I am way too excited to read Walking Disaster! Jamie McGuire did a great job at keeping this book exciting and I can wait to hear Travis side of the story!
0375869026|5.0|An awesome, heartfelt book!  The author does a great job handling a difficult situation and making the reader relate to Auggie's situation.  One of the best books I've read in a long time!  I highly recommend this book to people of all ages!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. I am totally hooked. It seems so simple at first. Then each level gets a little more challenging. It is awesome.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|This series has great animation and a nice story to go with it. I know some people don't like it but I very well enjoyed it. I already had the blu-ray version but I wanted the DVD version so I would have both. I haven't opened the DVD version seeing as there is no need to. But the real reason I bought this version was so I could make my very own Art Box similar to what Funimation does. And I must say I'm very excited on how it came out. You can see my personally made Art box up top.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Great ending to a great trilogy!Its hard to find another trilogy that lives up to this one.Try watching all 3 together,youll get it, a complete story.
B008XG1X18|4.0|It's a very well done app, but ot has problems sometimes. At first I would have to load the app several times before actually using it. But other than that it's been good. Handy, but slow at times.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|The movie started out slow and got worse.I thought the CGI was fair. The story line was predictable .I am a THERON fan ,but that part was not for her.
B00785P2QC|4.0|good free game. have had trouble with it crashing and been unable to open again. the onlynfix seems to be to reinstall the game
B005LAJ1H2|3.0|Well, the second season had less episodes then the first season ,<br />It had the same action that gangster movies have. I do like steve Buscemi acting and I look forward to watching season three .
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I loved playing this game for free. Then I upgraded to paid app. Bad idea...worked for two days and then crashed and burned ... can't open - can't play. Boo! Please fix or refund my money!<br /><br />Update:  The game works now, but hangs up occasionally for no apparent reason.  If I shut it off and turn it back on sometimes it will the behave normally.  I play this with my teenage grand daughter. It gives us pleasure and laughs when it is behaving!  Works much better than before - my last gripe is I bought add ons and then they disappeared when the update was worked on.  I hesitate to spend any more on this game as I cannot be sure add ons will work or stay on my game!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Mediocre<br /><br />Well written but rather boring after the first few chapters. Would not bother reading any followup books, unless they some better content.
B003NTMREM|1.0|I am a huge fan of sci-fi. I love X-files and Firefly, for instance, and Torchwood is less than pale in comparison to these great sci-fi series. I get that sci-fi is supposed to cater to the improbable, but the acting and the story lines are so difficult to believe that I could not get into the series. I still gave it a chance by watching a few episodes, but then the drama between the characters started getting totally ridiculous. I would not recommend this series to anyone.
1608193381|4.0|Actually an ABC of what Uncle Milton never told you...<br />  Chang states no country ever achieved a high standard of living by relying upon the service industry.<br />  I am, however, wary of his World Bank citations.  For example, WB supposedly published data stating the 2007 per capita income of the U.S. was $46,040 or the average household of 2.5 took in $115,000!  This number has to be absolutely wrong unless the unequal distribution of wealth totally skewed the statistic.<br />  Free market is a sham.  Trickle down is a joke.  U.S. executive pay is outrageous.  Worker wages/benefits have fallen, etc., etc.  Actually, nothing is a surprise to anyone possessing a modicum of skepticism.<br />  Chang has an interesting take on micro finance which I never considered when receiving those slick solicitation brochures stating only a small contribution will set some poverty stricken person up in a micro business, .  This subject requires more investigation.<br />  Then there is a humorous comment asserting that the winners of the Nobel Prize for economics may actually be dim bulbs leading a charge of human lemmings over the cliff.  (As a humanities major, I Googled(tm) the Nobel Prize for literature and came up with a list of obscurity chosen for some reason or another. Try this in your area of expertise and see what you think!)  We are talking about a very high cliff.<br />  There is, according to Chang, no evidence that more education leads to greater national prosperity.  (p. 178.)  Apprenticeship and on the job training may be more relevant.  This goes against the many economic development seminars I have attended, including a one starring Ph.D. nut I called Ed the Psychic.  Chang has a serious point there.  I think most of the education requirements are used merely to toss most of the job applications into the circular file.  Most job applicants do not really need all the prerequisites because they are sharp people and can learn most of their functions with a few days of mentoring.  Read pages 182-183 for a real eye opener.<br />  Not exactly any new revelations, but a great introduction to the real world.days of mentoring.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Challenging, fun, and addicting.  Cannot  find a way to put the game down.  Best game I've played on kindle in a long time.
B0081BU42O|3.0|ADDED BY EDIT:  Now that I've finished the book, I agree with those here who feel let down.  My personal favorite was Excession, and I liked most of the preceding books.  Since Excession, maybe Mr. Banks has run out of steam.  Nothing new here, and there doesn't seem to be anything at stake.  Neither the concept of subliming nor one small episode in the Culture's early founding were terribly interesting.  Political murders made no sense in the context of an imminent departure into the sublime, and also were inconsistent with the idea that a civilization had reached the very advanced point that it wants to sublime.<br /><br />And having the big ships zip around from here to there suddenly made the galaxy feel small, where in the earlier books one still had a sense of distance and separation.  (Very little current sci-fi gives a sense of the vastness.)<br /><br />Well, I'll still buy the next one, but I'm a bit sad that Mr. Banks's fun ideas seem to have run their course.<br /><br />ORIGINAL COMMENT:  Enjoying this new Culture book by Iain -- maybe with an M; I can never remember -- Banks.  But there's a problem.  In the Kindle edition, dashes in the original -- have been replaced by hyphens-.  That's wrong.  Here's a sample:<br /><br />\\"Vyr got right through the central, especially demanding section of the second-last movement without-for the first time-making any mistakes.\\"<br /><br />The first hyphen above is correct (although I wonder whether Mr. Banks hadn't actually written \\"second-to-last\\").  But the second and third hyphens above are wrong.  They should be dashes.  The sentence should be:<br /><br />\\"Vyr got right through the central, especially demanding section of the second-last movement without -- for the first time -- making any mistakes.\\"<br /><br />As Banks likes to use dashes, my eyes are constantly tripping over this publishing error.  And it's happening only because the publisher got lazy and permitted a systemic error in the Kindle edition.  Come on-- proof your work for ten minutes.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I am not a fan of Paul McCarthy, but after seeing the PBS special on the making of this album, I had to have it.  It is everything I hoped it would be.  This album shows a side of Paul I've never heard and the tunes are some you've probably never heard of, but which you will probably not forget easily.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It was a great book can't wait for the next book. Can't wait to see where it goes . Thanks for a relaxing release
B00913P6G0|5.0|every track on the album is gold. theres absolutely nothing i can hate on. its just very different (in a good way) from all other mainstream albums right now
0199601348|5.0|A very creative approach to present 1000 years of history in all its diversity just following 13 different cities out of 1000 city-states. The best primer for clássical Greece one could read.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is an awesome movie and great deal for the blu ray and dvd combo pack can not wait to see more
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is pretty good. I like being able to see how battery life gets use by different activities. Worth getting.
1568363931|5.0|I got this book because I bought some bento boxes for my family and I wanted to know how to make bentos. I have to say this book went above and beyond my expectations! It has amazing steps, alternatives, pictures, and not to mention just delicious food! I could not be happier with this book!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This product is well worth the money! Phone has been dropped, wet, and took some abuse and is working great!
B000003N7K|5.0|The perfect combination of the ultimate jazz instrumentalist, John Coltrane,and the seriously musical crooner, Johnny Hartman. The two play off each other in flawless harmony. Their interpretation of The Lush Life, in particular,brings tears to the eyes and soul.
1416585710|5.0|A very COMPLEX story of a MARRIAGE (a LOVING marriage) Of A SUCCESSFUL WRITER and his WIFE, LISEY, that drifts into another story of his life before  marriage---and after. (Kinda' reminds me of a book within a book ---like The World According To Garp) This one can get really dark, really dark and scarey. Yes, at times, I had to put this one down for awhile.<br />When it's all over for Mr. King, maybe somebody should study his brain. YOWEY!!! YIKES!!! I still get CHILLS thinking about the many STRANGE and INTENSE (TOTALLY STRANGE and INTENSE) paths this story weaves. HOW DID HE COME UP WITH THIS STUFF???
B002CT5UTI|4.0|Frederick Hallam, a radiochemist of average intellect and fresh out of university, suddenly finds himself in communication with beings from a parallel Universe who had contacted him by locating a nearly forgotten bottle of Tungsten metal on Hallam's desk.  Through his communication with these \\"para-Men\\", Hallam learns how to build an Electron Pump that allows energy to be transferred between the two universes cleanly and with no pollution.<br /><br />Hallam is hailed a hero and named Father of the Electron Pump, but his partner, Ben Denison knows otherwise.  Denison is well aware that the design of the pump originated from the beings in the parallel Universe.  However, when Denison tries to speak out, he is silenced and blackballed by the scientific community.<br /><br />Years later, a physicist named Frank Lamont uncovers dangerous information about the Pump, that it's very existence could destroy our galaxy, and interviews Hallam about it.  Hallam is naturally outraged and moves against Lamont, pulling strings that nearly crush Lamont's career.  As a last resort, Lamont approaches Senator Burt, head of the Committee on Technology and Environment, to discuss his evidence.  Burt explains that if Lamont can prove his theories with unimpeachable math, the senator will do his best to take Hallam down.  Returning to his laboratory, Lamont finds another message from the para-Universe:  PUMP BAD PUMP BAD STOP STOP STOP PUMP!!!!<br /><br />Meanwhile, on a planet in the parallel universe, beings known as Soft Ones, mutable sentient creatures capable of shape shifting, work together with Hard Ones, solid bi-pedal beings that cannot touch the Soft Ones without enduring pain.  Within the culture of the Soft Ones, there are three types, Emotional, Parental, and Rational.  Together, they make a triad, what we might consider a family.  Only the Rationals ever speak to the Hard Ones, as the Hard Ones are the most intelligent of all beings and only the Rationals can understand them.<br /><br />In one unusual triad, Odeen the Rational works closely with the Hard Ones on the Electron Pump while explaining his work to Dua, his Emotional mate. Breaking tradition and stereotype, Dua takes a deep interest in science.  Meanwhile, their Parental mate, Tritt, is only concerned with taking care of the triad's children and becomes jealous of Odeen's attention to Dua.<br /><br />However, Dua defies all and makes her way into the caverns where the Pump is being constructed.  Armed with scientific knowledge beyond that of any Emotional, she learns of the dangers of the Pump and sends a message of warning to our universe...<br /><br />Back in our universe, Denison arrives on the Moon (now populated for generations) in an attempt to rehabilitate his scientific career.  He works with a device called the Pionizer, partly designed by Lunar scientists, that he hopes will compensate for the dangerous levels of energy being pulled into our Universe by the Electron Pump.  In doing so, he encounters friction from the existing lead physicist, Barron Neville who sends his girlfriend, Selene, to spy on Denison.<br /><br />Can Denison finally disprove Hallam?  What is Neville's true agenda on the Moon?  With whom does Selene's loyalty actually lie?<br /><br />Asimov breaks the story into three parts, each containing several chapters.<br /><br />Part One: \\"against stupidity...\\"<br />Part Two: \\"...the gods themselves...\\"<br />Part Three: \\"...contend in vain?\\"<br /><br />(\\"Against stupidity the gods themselves contend in vain.\\")<br /><br />While the entire book is a fine example of hard SF, it is truly the final section that is most laden with scientific discourse between the characters of Denison and Selene and finally, Lunar administrator Gottstein, Denison, and Neville.  In that way, the story turns dry at times, but it was actually a pleasure to read an \\"old school hard SF novel\\" by one of the masters.  The Gods Themselves is a well paced, intelligent story with imaginative development of the aliens in the para-Universe.  It's no surprise that it took the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1972 and the Hugo Award the following year.ative development of the aliens in the para-Universe.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I love this story! I couldn't wait to read this second book.  The story of love and protecting no matter what, is so sweet.  These two are growing together and healing together with tons of great sex.
0375507256|5.0|Simply amazing!<br />The story is really capturing and breathtaking, and the structure of the book may drive you crazy, as it's like a circle in a circle in a circle, and every single chapter/period is connected to the others in a surprising way, but every story is interrupted to make space for another one, and then after the center story, all the other interrupted chapters are recalled back and completed.<br />Stunning!
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Bought this from Amazon.com for my ipad 2.<br />Just the best way to read,and what to say about the Awanted Man.As always Lee has done it again.a must read,can't put it down,so allow yourself a rainy afternoon.Full of surprises and intrigue.<br />So do yourself a favour.Just buy it.
B009WJX10G|5.0|Good episode.  I have been a fan of the show since the first season and I am extremely pleased with the new story-line: back to where we started.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Best game for the money. Its challenging and helps pass the time on long business flights. I would definitely recommend this product.
B00011KHTM|1.0|This is NOT an Apple product. The price and the packaging suggest that it is, but it is not. The mini-DVI end does not fit into my mini-DVI port. Even when you force it in, it still does not fit properly. Do not buy this adapter.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|game makes me nervous!  I want the coins to fall so bad.  wish you could accumulate coins so I could play longer.  I refuse to purchase coins.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Love and support all Peter Berg movies.. directing, acting, all  x x x x x x x x x x
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I wish history was this interesting when I was in high school!  This could be a history text for WWII.  My only distractions were keeping the expanded cast of characters straight, especially the Peshkovs.  And the multitudinous \\"small world\\" meetings were just a bit too much.  I \\"couldn't wait\\" for this book after reading \\"Fall of Giants.\\"  Now I can't wait for the third of the trilogy.  And I'm sorry it will be over after that.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|POTO is my favorite show of all-time.  I met the entire Broadway cast starring Tom O'Leary as the Phantom many years ago and had a poster signed by everyone in silver paint pen which is proudly framed in my living room.  I was too young to see London show with Michael Crawford & Sarah Brightman.  <Sigh>  The POTO movie was a letdown except for Emmy Rossum's voice, lavish costumes and staging.  I didn't think that I'd be blown away by a live performance starring anyone else in the lead roles.  I was wrong.  Ramin and Sierra are fabulous in the title roles.  Both are great actors and possess amazing voices.  And isn't Sierra just gorgeous?!  Their chemistry together is electric.  I also loved how the Phantom kept angrily yelling \\"Sing!!!\\", at Christine.  The actor whom portrays Raoul is very believable and sings beautifully.  A nice change from actor Patrick Wilson whom was wooden in the film version.  Anyhow, buy or rent this DVD and enjoy the show!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Fast moving, exciting keeps you turning pages, full of excitement. Can't wait to read the next one. always a good read.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I had read that this book wasn't as compelling as the Harry Potter series and didn't get the good reviews as the HP's,  but I thought that while this was not the fantasy of the HP, it was an extremely well written adult book.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Great job Ms Rowling!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|It's definately a good movie but its pretty much another Iron man movie. Should have been called Iron Man and friends.
B000JMKO0A|3.0|I enjoyed reading Eleven Minutes.  It had me on edge most of the book.  The only thing I didn't like was that it was not enough description in the book for Me.  I would suggest this book in a book club.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This game is a good time waster.  The levels can be gone through fairly easily.  Overall - not a bad game.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I read the Kindle version....AND I'd advise this version (explained at end of review)<br /><br />It is interesting to hear adults and children have similar coma experiences. And maybe that's the point....we're all children when it comes to the Creator. It is also interesting as he was going through the exhausting process of re-entering the conscious world (I did it as a child, and it is exhausting), he had a strong sense that there was a little person for whom he was still responsible: his devastated 10 year old son. It is not the first time that Love has proven powerful enough to wake the dead. Helps me understand God's willingness to redeem...that while we are yet a long way off, God sees us and looks upon us with compassion.<br /><br />Alexander is clear that there will be naysayers and those who will disparage his experience...and I am glad he realized that up front...the reviews already show that; however, he has crafted a beautiful experience for all, and a carrot to entice the medical community to rethink their explanations of NDE's. Another doctor, writing almost 2,000 years ago recorded, \\"Even if one rises from the dead [to detail the afterlife], they will not believe him.\\" Oh well. It did not bother Dr Luke to tell the truth, so I hope it won't bother Dr Eben.<br /><br />If there is any criticism, it would be that the clinical descriptions are a little medical-terminology-heavy. I still had to look up a few terms, despite medical training. My suggestion (unless you're a medical professional) is to buy the Kindle version so that you can instantly look up the jargon by simply pressing the word. But even if you don't have a Kindle or IPad, you'll \\"get\\" what is most important: Love.

B00005BJ9W|5.0|I bought the vinyl album when this first came out in 1982 and eventually lost track of it, and for some reason never bought it again on CD. On a recent home visit to Belgium, I saw the CD being available for next to nothing in the local CD store, and picked it up. Glad I did!<br /><br />\\"Rio\\" (9 tracks; 43 min.; plus 3 asssorted videos) starts off with the title track, and if you grew up in the 80s, you surely will remember the classic video for this song, which seemed in \\"heavy rotation\\" on MTV for years! \\"My Own Way\\" was the first (and least successfull) single off the album, but I find that the song has aged very well, more so for example than thw monster hit \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\", which I cannot stand anymore (due to over-exposure over these last 30 years, I suppose). Indeed, I find the album most appealing in the non-single tracks, as these songs remained obscured from radio (over)exposure and now sound very nice: \\"Lonely In Your Nightmare\\" and \\"Last Chance On the Stairway\\" rock as good as any of the hit singles. \\"New Religion\\" is another coulda-shoulda hit. But the very best for me is the closing track \\"The Chauffeur\\", a 5 min. paranoid and dark song reminding me of Roxy Music. What a way to close out the album! (This CD reissue comes with enhanced content, namely 3 videos including the \\"Rio\\" and \\"Hungry Like a Wolf\\" clips.)<br /><br />Relistening to \\"Rio\\" in its entirely after all these years is like rediscovering a long lost friendship: immediately familiar, yet still fresh in the ears. It is nothing short of amazing to me that this year we celebrate the 30th anniversary of this album! Not only is it by far still the best album of Duran Duran, but in retrospect it is also one of the very best of the 1980s \\"New Romantic\\" wave out of the UK. If you are new to Duran Duran, you cannot go wrong with this. If you are familiar with Duran Duran's greatest hits, you will be surprised by the strength of the non-hit tracks on here. In all, \\"Rio\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B0096DFBZQ|5.0|If you like racing and love pacman, then this game if for you. Try it and I know you will be hooked.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|An awesome continuation of the story from Fifty Shades of Grey. It's not quite as racy as the first book and focuses more on developing the relationship between Ana and Christian. You get to know their personalities and backgrounds more. It's a very fast and easy read! If you liked the first one then you will enjoy this one.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I bought this book for my Kindle for three reasons...1) the price was right 2) the title caught my attention 3) I needed something that wasn't too heavy before I started my bookclub book (which I knew was going to be heavy).<br /><br />I didn't read the reviews before I read it, but I did see that it had a pretty good rating.  I really ended up liking this book.  His adventures were crazy and like other people have mentioned, a lot like Forrest Gump (which I loved too).  I loved how we started his journey into this story with him as an older man and then learned more about his youth as the story unfolded.  It was fun to read how he just picked up friends along the way. The author did a good job tying a lot of events and people together.  Not getting too upset over anything and adopting the lifestyle of not worrying about things and \\"what will be will be\\" allowed him to have a full, long life.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game! I recomend it. to everyone who likes adventure, imagination, and survivel. Thank God it came out for kindle fire! Now I can finaly get rid of block story and get minecraft pe. It's cheep and it has great gameplay. I've only herd and noticed good things about it. GET THIS GAME!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone thinking about publishing for the Kindle.  It include far more detailed information than any of the other free books.  If you don't know everything in this book then you aren't ready to publish for the Kindle.

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I will say it is the first Spark's book I have read but this opened me up to how much I like this authors writing style. This is one of those books I couldn't put down as I explored the twists and turns of a long lost love.
B008V0OLOW|2.0|I certainly can applaud an artist who takes on a new direction musically, but this one's not only perplexing; it's totally out of the grasp of her talent.  Not to mention, the material sounds so acoustic and unplugged that one wonders where the \\"Rag\\" even IS.  I was expecting a Eubie Blake kind of listening experience.  This seems more like a back woods/countrified recording from the Louisiana bayou.<br /><br />Additionally, I've always found Krall to be a really terrible singer and this album fully supports that claim.  Her vocals are just not very pleasing to my ears.  She's always breathless, has no vibratto and seems perpetually emotionally detached from the lyrics that she sings.  As a pianist tho, she's absolutely brilliant.  Hence, 2 stars for musicianship.
B004SBX112|2.0|Just as the other gentleman said, I have been looking and looking for the updates for Halloween and they are not there.  Wow, I figure ESPECIALLY if you pay for an app, you should sure get  the update in a timely manner. I will never purchase another app from Amazon!

B007THA4FI|4.0|Well written book that unfolds and intertwines the lives of each character in a believable manner. Rowling presents a snapshot of the social issues all modern societies face in a humanistic non-judgemental fashion.
B008MEM24S|5.0|i got this for my girl to play and then when i playe i could not stop.  my girls md i love this game.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I played this movie on my PS3 connected to the optoma gt750 with a 142 inch screen, using optoma zf2100 glasses and it was awesome.By far the best 3D I've seen. Other movie and game makers should follow this example, if it adds to the price, I'll pay it. I saw several bad reviews from people on here saying \\"It won't play on my PS\\", BS. Learn how to operate your equipment, and the other bad reviews were from people with less than par equipment, probably using incorrect settings. Then there are the people who write bad reviews because that's just what they do. PS3 only outputs 720p, and the gt750 is only 720p, but it still looked amazing. Buy it.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Not her best album, but i think that it still deserves a very good review.  All of the songs are amazing as usual, but not exactly like all of her others.  I love this CD and i really recommend it to anyone who loves Taylor Swift.

B005VSRFEA|5.0|Are you a human? Are you a non-human entity that would describe yourself as a humanist or a student of human thought? BUY THIS BOOK.<br /><br />I've never really thought of myself as a \\"systems\\" person or much interested in the philosophy of human society, and this is a book that tackles both. I read it after a friend practically beat my head in with a copy. \\"Fine, fine,\\" I said, \\"I'll read the book!\\"<br /><br />So I read it. And it has changed the way I look at the world around me.<br /><br />It's also a good, fun, entertaining read that shows you what it is trying to say by using examples. It doesn't get bogged down in theory, but by the time you're done, you'll understand the theory that other more didactic books would put you to sleep trying to teach.<br /><br />There's no way to quite describe how broad an appeal this book should have. You're probably a person reading this, right? BUY THIS BOOK.
B004WR125O|1.0|I can have multiple laptops and the wireless TV on my router but never could get this adapter to get more than 20% to 31% signal from the next room. Go figure.
0345803485|1.0|I can't believe this book is a bestseller. I borrowed it from a friend but if I had paid for it I'd be asking for a refund. I don't even know where to start...<br /><br />Well, let's see. The idea was interesting and that's where anything good about this book ends.<br /><br />The writing is abysmal, the pace is incredibly slow and we're forced to suffer through utterly useless but ample descriptions of every little thing the characters do. The language is basic, with big words thrown in here and there; at one point, one of the characters teases the other about a word he used saying \\"have you been playing with the thesaurus?\\". Well, that's exactly the impression I got, that the author played with the thesaurus every now and then, making the rest of the sentences look even more limited. The characters have a handful of gestures they keep repeating over and over until my head hurt and I was rolling my eyes (yes, that's one of the \\"inside jokes\\") every 3 minutes. I won't even get into the spelling errors.<br /><br />The characters don't make any sense at all. He's a gorgeous self-made billionaire (!), extremely talented pianist, working to rid the world of hunger and already established and very experienced in a dark life of BDSM. ALL at the ripe age of 27! She's a college senior with a major in English literature and the vocabulary of a semi-illiterate teenager; a virgin at 21, she's the only student in the developed world who, in the year 2011, has no email address. The author is trying hard to make them seem intelligent, strong and, at times, hot-headed, but the only impression I got was of weak, undecided, shallow halfwits.<br /><br />All in all, I think I'll wait for the movie to come out and not waste my time with the other books. There is no way in hell it can be any worse than this book. Maybe some writer with half a brain and a drop of talent can take the idea which, as I said, has potential, and turn it into something worth watching.<br /><br />DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK! Seriously, you'll end up kicking yourself.
B0061QD82E|5.0|I have never seen this movie look so good!!!<br />Disney has done a great job on this one showing it in its real OAR.<br />Totally recommend it!!!
B007T99ENE|3.0|McEwan's device of a honeytrap calculatingly used by the British secret service is reasonable until it unfolds that the targeted author is altogether pointless. Postwar Britain is portrayed as depressingly frugal so how can MI5 afford such nonchalant extravagances? The use of real contemporary writers and politicians  and the references to Ian Flemings's role in the cold war takes us flitting between reality and fiction. To me the final twist seemed to rob this enjoyable novel of its cadence, though the artifice of plots within plots is at least consistent.<br /> It is a very British novel indeed; the players all scarred by their class status, their religious inheritance and their xenophobia. Perhaps this is what releases the character's sexual indulgences, their guilty pleasures. What a change from the excruciating drawn out foreplay of a novel that \\"On Chesil Beach\\" gave us. It is these observations of the national psyche however that makes the novel a pleasure.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|...and that's just what this is. Granted, it's nice to see the letters becoming more well written as the story goes on and the character improves, but seriously: this is a teen story. Don't try to read it if you're done with your adolescence.
B000TGJ7ZY|4.0|This review is for the quality of the Blu-ray version:<br />Just got the Blu-ray version today, assuming it would be much better than the DVD version, which I already have.  WRONG!!  The Blu-ray is darker, and the sound is so low you have to turn the volume all the way up to understand the dialog.  I put the standard DVD in my Blu-ray player and the picture and sound quality was MUCH better than the Blu-ray version, so don't waste your money or your time purchasing the Blu-ray version if you already have the DVD.  What a rip off.<br />Of course the movie is excellent, but the better viewing experience is with the DVD, NOT the Blu-ray.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|I loved this movie. The picture and sound quality are great. Lots of humor and action in all the right places. Easily one of the best, most entertaining movies of the year.<br /><br /> The only gripe I have with this release is in the special features department. I wish there were more and better special features. What is here is pretty crappy. The commentary is good,but everything else is just fluff.
0525953728|4.0|I enjoyed the book from the standpoint of understanding all of the work that goes into preparing for a project like this.  I think we don't always understand the hard work of building mock up's of a target and then the repetitive nature of training that goes on.  Frankly the assault on the compound where Bin Laden was found was anti-climatic because it didn't really involve much of a fight.  That reflects that good training, good intel and the dedication of all those involved help to make it successful and relatively anti-climatic.<br /><br />The main 'new fact' that I was drawn to was the description of the CIA Intelligence agent who worked for ten years in tracking down OBL.  I think that she did a thankless job that was most likely difficult to do and required lots of work, lots of disappointment and then no real thanks after Bin Laden is killed.  The actual thanks she got was being handed boxes and boxes of computer disks and papers that she would spend months sorting through for the after action reports and further intel about other operatives.<br /><br />I actually found myself wondering if she would ever be allowed to write a book (much like the 911 commission report) that would give us more insight into the good work that Intelligence agents do.<br /><br />Not a lot new in this book, but still an interesting read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed the book.  Took awhile to get the characters in the right family. His books have alot of history in them which I like very much. Highly recommend it.

But, thanks to the extraordinary undertaking by John Maloof, who miraculously discovered the treasure-trove that was Ms. Maier's life-long portfolio, we are privileged to be able to gaze and marvel at her photos, her maticulous eye for detail and her uncanny ability to transform the ordinary into the exceptional!

0316228532|3.0|Rowling writes a \\"Casual Vacancy\\" with the ambition, imagination, and scope of a multi book series. In this delivery, her amazing gift is her downfall. There are too many characters: multiple unlikeable families of age stepped, flawed participants who yell, scream, complain, whine, or moan their way through the chapters of the book. Most chapters are depressing and exhausting. This overly ambitious statement of contemporary life in the small, seemingly charming, English town of Pagford is neither kind nor uplifting. In many instances, the introduction of yet another ugly, grave, social issue made me want to stop reading. Woven throughout the lives of the Pagford inhabitants is the theme of class and caste preoccupation in it's very English way; by the middle of the book the town of Pagford, itself, has become an ugly character. This may be the most telling statement of all about contemporary English life. The book provides a rich tapestry of social issues in Pagford, and that feat is Rowling's genius. Unfortuneately, it does not translate to a compelling story. Too often, the story is repelling. As an avid reader of convincing yarns, I am disappointed in this effort. As a writer, I am envious of Rowling's seemingly endless gift.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game and bought the double point's but nothing happens for my kindle fire I want a refund I cant get my double coins &gt;:/
B003IDMUJA|4.0|This book got more intense and interesting as it progressed. Initially it seemed to wander through the early part of his life but as it got into the part where he begins to create his windmill then it become quite gripping and inspirational.<br />An amazing story and fortunately one with a happy ending.
0374214913|5.0|As someone with ties to Silicon Valley and a deep love of social media and books, I felt like this story was written just for me. I wonder whether it will feel quaint in 10 years, but for today, it was fantastic.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|i like to play this with the kids so i got it to entertain my self it is fun. and will kill some time if you need to
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have seen a decent amount of reviews criticizing this book for not progressing the story fast enough. I have to say though I have enjoyed ADWD just as much as the previous books in the series. I am a little ticked that I have to wait 3 years to read the next book though... But that is just a testament to how well the series is written.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I watched the movie before I read the book.<br /><br />I found the movie to be very vague and lifeless in a way. The actors were not that good, and showed little emotion. Overall, it seemed more like a TV movie than a blockbuster movie.<br /><br />A fan of Young Adult books, I decided to read the book, knowing that the books shed more insight on the characters.<br /><br />I was right, but there still was very little emotion in the book itself as far as characters. What emotion it did have was shallow.<br /><br />Where the book really shines is the whole gladiator thing, along with the taboo of kids fightening kids.<br /><br />It has been done before, sure, but it is still fun. Sadly, the good part with the action only takes up maybe 10% of the book which is at the end.<br /><br />Until then, you have to deal with Katniss and her weird emotions.<br /><br />To be a high profile book, there were many grammer and spelling errors. I would expect from a new author.<br /><br />As harsh as I may sound, I did enjoy the book (And series) for what it was. There is just something about the theme and the taboo that pulls you in.<br /><br />As far as other books that I recommend, it would be Sky of Dust: The Last Weapon if you want the same feel as Hunger Games. Gritty, set in the future, and kids surviving the government.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0090RI2N6 Sky of Dust: The Last Weapon]]<br /><br />If you want something a bit more fantasy, then Percy Jack series is good as well.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00280LYIC The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians)]]
B007THA4FI|4.0|Casual Vacancy was phenomenal! At first, I had trouble following the characters, as there are certainly many of them, and they are introduced wicked fast, but JKR did a great job reminding you who was who without being repetitive. It is a very deep, very adult-themed novel, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. With all of the different sociological issues (rich at war with the impoverished, parents and children, adults and adolescents, and even racial tensions, as well as exploring domestic violence and bullying), it was a page turner to the very end. It was stark, realistic, and a far cry from the Wizarding novels of JKR's renown, but it was fantastic. I just wouldn't recommend it to someone under 13.
159413586X|3.0|Mockingjay seemed like one of those books that just seemed to be written many years after the prior book. I mean that it lost its meaning.<br /><br />Mockingjay set to end Katniss's adventure, but it just left a lot of questions unanswered.<br /><br />The relationships in this bookwere superficial and it was a chore to believe.<br /><br />The book itself, like most of Collins other work, seemed stretched more than it needed to be while still leaving out important information and lacking in areas that would have made a better story.<br /><br />In this book, we have Katniss play as a pawn along with her friends. There is no real action until the end (The stuff in the middle I would not consider action).<br /><br />The usual Collins grammer and spelling issue are still there as well.<br /><br />Overall, the book seemed rushed and lacking. Again, I liked it. Not as good as the prior two, but was still an easy read. The series is written in a way that lets you build your own opinions and story in a way.<br /><br />If you like the Hunger Games series, I recommend:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0090RI2N6 Sky of Dust: The Last Weapon]]<br /><br />and<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00280LYIC The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians)]]
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Does not include all the same options as the website does, but close enough for me. sometimes the app crashes my HTC sprint phone.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I had seen the movie a few years back, and I liked it okay. More of a made for TV movie.<br /><br />Usually book to movies are poor due to losing a lot in the process.<br /><br />When I went into the book, I was suprised very fast how very different the story was from the movie. Very little was the same, which made reading the book more interesting.<br /><br />It was very in depth with each character, and they really do seem like real living people. It makes the world of greek gods present.<br /><br />Rick uses a very neat \\"You have X amount of days until chaos\\" theme that is present in all of his books. This keeps them from dragging on for too long.<br /><br />There is a good amount of action, as well as Percy struggling to understand his powers as a demigod.<br /><br />They visit different real like areas, which is a good sign that they are not limited to one area.<br /><br />Overall, The Lightening Theif is a solid introduction to the expansive world of Greek (And Roman) gods.<br /><br />While they are not Greek/Roman god related, I recommend the following books:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0090RI2N6 Sky of Dust: The Last Weapon]]<br />[[ASIN:1423113454 The Red Pyramid (The Kane Chronicles, Book 1)]]
B000IDEORY|4.0|This is a very good film. Not  a great film but a very good one - still. I had not seen \\"Dirty Dancing\\" in several years, but my wife had to have this comprehensive addition. It turns out to be fun to watch. Not just the film, but all the extras as well. It is also sad to think that at least five of the talented people who worked on the film are no longer with us - from director, Amele Ardolino to the incomparable Jerry Orbach. And then there is Patrick Swazee. I never truly appreciated him, but have developed a respect for his talents, both as an actor and as a  dancer. \\"Dirty Dancing\\" is a rollicking, coming of age film, in which Jennifer Gray is perfectly cast as \\"Baby.\\" We see the arc of her character, first as the tentative \\"daddy's girl,\\" and finally as the free-thinking woman she has become. And all with her original nose.
1594135851|4.0|I liked Catching Fire a bit better than Hunger Games, but in different ways.<br /><br />The characters seem more real, which the first book lacked. Unfortunatly, the characters still seem fake.<br /><br />There is more violence and more time to explore their district (As well as some of the others.<br /><br />Collins, unfortunatly, seemd to rush the book as she tends to do. When Peeta and Katniss were visiting the other Districts, there was plenty of story that could have been told to boost the story and introducing all the other characters.<br /><br />Then they breezed through training again, and are thrown into a cool new arena.<br /><br />The arena was genious, yet they did not explore it much. Shame on Collins.<br /><br />She tends to build something up, then throw it away.<br /><br />Again, like in all her books, grammer and spelling are an issue.<br /><br />And, again, I still say the same thing. I like the book complaints aside. It is just a fun book that so much can be spun from. The taboo I guess.<br /><br />If you like the Hunger Games series, I recommed the following series:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0090RI2N6 Sky of Dust: The Last Weapon]]<br /><br />and<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00280LYIC The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians)]]

B008R9QAY6|5.0|The story of Artaserse as written in libretto by Metastasio is the tale of a Persian King Artaxeres. Though there are over 40 known settings of Metastasio's text, the libretto was first set by Leonardo Vinci (1690-1730) in 1730 for Rome. And it is this setting of the perils of the Persian King that is featured in this rather amazing showcase of countertenors from around the world. The text was also set by such composers as Gluck, JC Bach, Hasse, Galuppi, Myslivicek and Arne, but it is the original setting that gathers the most historic musical attention.<br /><br />The opera is a string of florid pearls - arias so complex yet so penetratingly beautiful that it would seem after this recording that opera houses will begin to pay attention to the work. Of interest a French scholar, Charles de Brosses, wrote 10 years after Vinci's death from poisoning, `Vinci is the Lully of Italy: true, simple, natural, expressive, writing in the most beautiful, uncontrived way for the voice ... Artaserse has a reputation as his finest work, and one of Metastasio's finest too ... It is the most famous Italian opera.' And that is fine preparation for the performance captured here.<br /><br />Diego Fasolis conducts the Concerto Cologne in a completely authentic manner. At the time of the composition of Artasere, a papal decree banned women from appearing on the stages of the city's theatres, so the entire cast was male, with the female roles sung by castrati. This recording not only recognizes that bit of significant history, it honors it with the challenge of single-sex casting with a spectacular line-up of fine countertenors from around the world: Croatian-born Max Emanuel Cencic, the Frenchman Philippe Jaroussky, the Argentine Franco Fagioli, Romanian Valer Barna-Sabadus and Yuriy Mynenko from the Ukraine. The sole tenor in the recording is the German Daniel Behle.<br /><br />In addition to the beauties of the music both for orchestra and for singers that this fascinating work offers is the opportunity to hear the various comparisons of the differences in the qualities of vocal production of these five countertenors. Each voice in unique with some more florid in the upper range and others more dramatic in the lower - alto - range. In the end each of these gifted men is able to create a wholly credible character while at the same time offering some of the most thrilling examples of the gift of countertenor vocal production. This is a dazzling success of a recording!

B008FSCNTK|4.0|Most of these other reviews are probably from a single listen or so... Diana needed a departure.  This one is welcome.  Admittedly, it took me a few listens to fully appreciate this new Genre of sorts for Krall, but the last thing we needed was another typical jazz/swing album from her at this point.<br /><br />That said, Marc Ribot has been a favorite guitarist of mine for many years.  I've followed his career from Tom Waits to Zorn to his solo outings and now this.  He really makes this album for me.  When I'm not listening to the lyrics my heart falls inline with the sound of that guitar (banjo too).<br /><br />I like these songs.  This is an album that grows with subsequent listens...

They're hard rockers in a city that is fascinated by Indie garbage (IMO) and country-blues-rock fusion.  I'm just warning you - don't come to the \\"Live Music Capital of the World\\" and expect to find killer bands like this playing on every street corner.  You're more likely to find marginally talented, unshaven kids in skinny jeans wearing wool hats in the heat (idiots) trying to look & sound cool.<br /><br />The CD is in its own art sleeve.  The booklet contains lyrics and artwork.  They didn't cheap out on the packaging, so it was worth the buck or two over the digital download.  The Sword is also on a new label, so I don't know who is responsible for the packaging..but I like it.<br /><br />Finally, the music!  The production level is great on this record.  The band has blossomed in this area.  I can only describe the music as \\"killer stoner grooves that will have your head involuntarily bobbing.\\"  I read a lot about the comparisons to early Sabbath, and I agree.  On this recording they bring some vintage keyboard sounds in, mostly for very subtle background or intros.  Don't worry, this isn't Van Halen's 1984, where they're gonna fall off the deep end and go keyboard-centric (we hope).  I don't really feel the vocals follow Ozzy's style.  Instead I describe the vocals as purely unique and distinct, with respect to both the vocal feel and lyrical content.  The Sword seems to deliver the goods consistently.  The record is full of great guitar work, some really nice drumming, and sweet bass work (with some flashes of Geezer at times!).  If you liked Warp Riders, you'll feel like they picked up where they left off and makeit better.  Why change a time tested and true formula?  Just ask Coca Cola what happens when you make that sort of change.<br /><br />I've listened to the record in its entirety a few times.  They kick things off on the right foot with \\"The Veil of Isis\\".  I really like this tune out of the gate.  Other standouts include \\"Arcane Montane\\", \\"Dying Earth\\" and the title track \\"Apocryphon\\".  But those are early favorites - the complete work is worthy of my five star rating.<br /><br />I was able to catch this band in April 2012 @ Emo's East here in Austin.  The band was super tight and professional.  If you get the chance to catch them on the road, do it.  I will road trip it down to Houston to catch them @ Fitzgerald's in December.  I prefer this size venue to the big festivals.<br /><br />Rock on!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|It is a thrilling book, because although the story is based on very well known events as the First World War, Ken Follet drives you personally into those times and places as if you were travelling in a machine time!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is great for xbox I just got it 10-25-12. it is hard to jump put I can not figure out to fly.
B000W93CXQ|3.0|13 reasons why, in my humble opinion it was a good book, i believe its, better suited for younger readers (teens )
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was a great surprise.  I purchased it on a whim and was not disappointed.  It will run you through a gamut of emotions.  I am giving it to my 15 year old daughter to read.
B0029ZA49Q|4.0|Received the package within days upon ordering. Used it for my cycling trips where i can just stop and snap down the wonderful scenery along my cycling routes.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Fun game I never get sick of playin, you can play for free or you can spend a little real money to help you along.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have learned a simple way to entertain. my kids without having to worry about them. my kids love the game and spend hours on it
B008XNZMOU|5.0|This album is very interesting.  There are a lot of songs that definitely ARE and sound like Taylor- what we're used to.  But there are a lot of songs leaning towards pop that, at first you may go, \\"Eh, I don't like that at ALL\\".  But you'll probably grow to like it, as I did.  It's nice hearing her sing new things.  You must get this.  13 stars.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have learned so much from this book!  It has been a great help to me.  I think everyone who is struggling with health issues and or problems loosing weight should read this book.  It should be on the book shelf of every mother along with her cook books.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child's Reacher novels are always full of surprises.  Lots of action - never a dull moment. I hope he keeps them coming.
0425263916|4.0|We all love a good love story. We all love a good sex scene. Day managed to put those two together with finesse for the first crossfire novel. However, maybe I'm just dumb and a hopeless romantic that I didn't notice it before, but in this one, I don't see much love involved between Eva and Gideon. It's just good sex. Like knock your socks off and take two Tylenol in the morning good sex.<br /><br />I still really enjoyed the novel and look forward to the next one. I just want more substance than great sex. You can't have a good relationship without a healthy sex life, or equal terms. But I feel like that's all they have and they're clinging to it desperately.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am shocked how much I enjoyed this book seeing how it is not my normal choice of genre. I actually look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B004XQO8JG|5.0|Cobra rules.  The Blu-ray picture quality is pretty good.  Reminds me of my childhood when this movie would come on the TV on a Saturday afternoon.  Buy it.  It is awesome.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Full disclosure: I only paid 25 cents for this app on sale. After spending a month using it I really do feel that it is worth the $14.99 price but you all deserve to know that I did not spend that much.<br /><br />I only give 5 stars to products that exceed my expectations and this app has done that. I used it on the original Kindle Fire and it worked great. I mostly use it for Word documents this app has most of the major functions like colors, insertions and even word count. I actually typed out a 700 word document with this app for a client, uploaded it and he never knew the difference! You probably won't be typing long documents on your Kindle Fire or phone but you could if you had to.<br /><br />The PowerPoint part is easy to use and even includes some nice templates. For a team project in class I created my three slides with this app and our editor had no problem incorporating them into the rest of the presentation.<br /><br />The spreadsheet Part is admittedly the area where I spent the least time. I didn't have any problems reviewing and editing data and then sharing the results via Google Docs.<br /><br />The only real nitpick I have with this app is that you'll need to purchase a separate app ($5) if you want to view documents in a variety of fonts. There is a popup ad that offers to install this compatibility pack. If you press the 'install' button it opens the web browser and takes you to the product page on Amazon so you can buy it.<br /><br />Despite that, I think this app is well worth the money. It won't be a substitute for a full office productivity suite but in an emergency it will work. As a tool for reviewing and editing files on the go it can't be beat.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just like the ones at the park. cute game no brain required. good for a five minute break for free you cant go wrong
B002E0JL4A|5.0|In a world that seems to thrive on violence, cynicism, and sex for big-screen entertainment, thank goodness for movies like \\"Patch Adams.\\" Far from being just another feel-good movie, this true story of Dr. Patch Adams succeeds in finding the humanity that is waiting to be discovered in a world of agendas, budgets, and deadlines. Robin Williams plays the role like he was born to play it, teaching us that love and genuine concern for people go a lot further in healing their ailments than a mere medical license.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|It is note the greatest book if we consider it as the one to be winning any literature award, but is a book that for sure will keep you attached to the reading and to Mr. Grey.[[ASIN:0345803507 Fifty Shades Freed: Book Three of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
B005NKGEP2|4.0|The Expats is a spy thriller, but not exactly what readers have been taught to expect.  Rather than give us pure suspense, Chris Pavone gets his thrills from character development and interior tension.  The female lead is almost like a refuge from an Olen Steinhauer novel, and her uncomfortable presence is what makes this book a cut above average.  Do not go in expecting a Nelson DeMille book, but instead a more subtle kind of excitement -- of finding a popular novelist who can actually write.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Prometheus wasn't great, but it only missed that mark by a little, I think.  Visually, it was eye-popping, but that's more or less the state of the art these days.  Plot-wise, I think it held together fairly well, though I don't think that all of the connections that were implied between humanity and the Engineers were ever properly explained or borne out.  I found the characters to be a bit shallow; they were deffinitely just rolls, never quite fooling you into seeing them as people.  That said, the acting was fine, I just don't think the actors could do much more with the material, which was aimed at telling a 'big story' against a 'big backdrop', not focused on individuals or their stories.  The ending was only semi-satisfying, an obvious setup for a sequel, and established a tenuous, possible link to the 'Alien' series.  As Mr. Scott said, this movie obviously had a lot of 'Alien's DNA, but it's hard to say if it's an actual prequel or if it's set in some sort of alternate universe.  It was fun to watch, action packed, but ultimately a little unsatisfying for me.
B0087HT36U|5.0|the physics are amazing and this game is awesome. works great on my kindle fire. get this game right now!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Much better than the rubbish Uk cut version!! Very good film finally got the hulk right although would like him slightly taller but can't wait for avengers 2 just hope either black panther, spiderman or wolverine make an appearance!!!
0446580848|4.0|John Corey's back in this actioner from Nelson DeMille.<br /><br />And there's the added attraction of a Guest Star role by Paul Brenner, the star of [[ASIN:0446679100 The General's Daughter]] and [[ASIN:0446177938 Up Country]].<br /><br />Another Islamic terrorist is running around the Middle East -- in Yemen -- slaughtering tourists and trying to consolidate al Quaeda forces in the area, an American-born radical who calls himself The Panther. Corey and his wife, FBI agent Kate Mayfield, have been sold (unwillingly in Corey's case) on the idea of going on-site in Yemen and acting as bait in an elaborate plan to track down and put an end the The Panther -- one way or another -- and his network.<br /><br />Once there, they and the rest of the team -- including Brenner -- begin their figurative \\"up river\\" journey through the mess that's modern Yemen in an effort to carry out their mission, in the course of which they learn that things are not at all what they seem. There are other agendas in play, too, and Corey's team must figure out what's going on to successfully reach their goals and get back out with their skins in one piece.<br /><br />We have a political thriller mixed with adventure mixed with espionage all in one neat package. Fascinating portrayal of the mess that's modern Yemen (certainly no longer high on my vacation list! As if it ever was...). The pacing is excellent; the central characters believable and likeable; Corey's wisecracking is highly entertaining; the plotting is meticulous.<br /><br />A very fun read. Highly recommended.
B009439HEY|5.0|A lot of care, love and attention to detail went into these recordings. Steve Hackett is not only a master of his art at the top of his game, but a man who knows how to draw talent into a project. Of course, modern technology improves on the recording and the cool sounds that can be made, but that is not why these are so good.  They are excellent because Mr. Hackett has spent years thinking about these complex songs, and these new recordings sparkle with his seasoned interpretations. Even for someone who has been listening to Genesis for decades, these recording are a rediscovery and very fresh. I suspect (and hope) that Mr. Hackett has a few more prog masterpieces in his system. Great work!
0071752854|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo30J5LPWPACJAI]]This book really changed my way of thinking on what I do when I go in and have meetings with possible clients. It is well worth the money!<br />It's not a typical sales book and it definitely lives up to it's name! If you are in ANY kind of sales and doing everything that all the other sales books and professionals have told you to do, then you are doing it all WRONG and you really need this book! I never write reviews for books, but I felt compelled to write a review about this one because it is definitely worth the time and effort to read.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|WOW!!<br /><br />I picked this album up at Starbucks while buying my morning coffee, and recognized the artist from all the good vibes I've heard about him on the internet. I never heard his EP, never listened to him on Youtube, and really hadn't heard as much as one note from him.<br /><br />This album rocked me a bit. I listened to the whole thing twice during my commute and couldn't quite figure out what to think. I heard Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Prince (the Artist Formerly Known As), Chuck Berry, R&B, Soul, Delta Blues, and a smattering of so many other styles I couldn't quite put a finger on, other than knowing that I LOVED IT.<br /><br />I came to realize that even though I may not have liked every song, they were all brilliant in a different way from each other. If anyone listened to Jack White's Blunderbuss earlier this year, I liken this album to the absolutely fresh approach each of these different artists brought to their respective musical styles.<br /><br />Impressive stuff for the exquisite music it brought. Listen carefully. It's all there.
B006NXICT4|5.0|fantastic reading. This is the first book I've ever reviewed and its simply a fantastic read gripping from start to finish with lots of twists in between and a superb ending. I would recommend this to pretty much any body that simply loves a well written book
B000JMKTLO|5.0|There were so many unexpected twists and turns in this book that right up until the end, I wasn't certain who did it. The character development came at a nice pace, just enough information to peek your interest without overloading you with information.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Good mystery, decent prose. I didn't think it would hook me so thoroughly, being a light read, but it did, and I was sorry when it ended.
B003NX76BM|5.0|This book will entertain not only dog lovers, mystery buffs but also the romance readers.  This book will make you giggle, laugh and cry.  The characters are strong and the dogs are amazing.  A Must Read!
B005WBBYXO|5.0|Although i am only age nine with only marginal skills of reading   comprehension i love this book  it has action adventure  mystery and here and there love. in this book philip pullman shows his great understanding of writing literature.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed the book thus far and think it has a beautiful plot and a wonderful story. lovelu
0316228532|5.0|Jane Austen has come to life again in the 21st century, this time unfettered by 19th century literary conventions curtailing sex and foul language. Ms. Austen was not afraid to write about unlikeable people, and J. K. Rowling has shown that same courage in this work. Having served as a pastor and denominational official in rural Pennsylvania, I had no difficulty transposing the inhabitants of Pagford and Yarvil to America. Rowling's characters are real. I've known these people by other names with different regional dialects in another country. This is not a book to assuage one's hunger for a simple triumph of good over evil, but rather to motivate commitment for social justice. The realistic nature of this novel is not for the faint of heart but is bracing for those who seek truth in fiction.
044654759X|5.0|One of his great books.  Really enjoyed the book like have all his books. Great writer and will look forward to getting his next work.
0553801473|5.0|Its pretty good. The cast and characters from the other books really develop and flower in this one. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love it!! Might just read all three of them again because I can't get enough of Christian Grey and Ana Steel. Can't wait for the movie..I know it won't evern compare to the books but really excited!
B001FB4W0W|3.0|I just finished reading the entire Sookie Stackhouse series and I am impatiently waiting for the last book in the series to come out. I had purchased a used copy of the first season. I should have just bought a brand new one because my copy was in terrible condition. I got to watch the first disc and the second disc felt so grainy I wasn't real sure if it  would, but I tried anyway. It is in awful condition it would not even read in my dvd player. The seller was really great about it and I got my refund. So they made it alright. I'm sure it was just an over looked item I just happened to get. I still haven't got to see the first season yet. Christmas is coming soon, and I would like to think that I have been good the year.
B002RI90WM|5.0|This is a beautifully written book, combining two things i love; racing cars and animals.  I have read this book three times now, and can't wait to enjoy it again.
1449410243|3.0|I rather enjoy The Oatmeal, so I jumped on the chance to buy a hard copy version of Inman's work, because I feel it deserves to be supported. I still believe this, however I feel Inman has spoilt us with massive free content which starkly contrasts with the lack of new content.<br /><br />The book is short, with each strip (arc) taking several pages, and although I have not counted as such I doubt we get to even 20 strips. Each strip is massive, and the quality of the book is excellent, but I expected it would take more than 30 minutes to get through ...<br /><br />There are some great strips in here and even a poster of the titular strip, which is fantastic. But I can't help but feel Inman and his strip are natives of the Internet and the transition to print, in book form, is a poor substitute.
0061537969|5.0|This book is outstanding!! I thoroughly enjoyed reading every word. Normally, I cruise through books, often jumping over entire paragraphs, but every word, thought, and feeling expressed in this book was wonderful to read. Thank your for sharing so much. Doranne Long
0307352145|5.0|I recntly had an opportunity to listen to Susan Cain speak at Elliott Maise's Learning 2012 conference in Orlando.  If you heard Susan share with authority and passion about how we limit the creativity, innovation, learning and productivity of our introvert teamamtes and friends you would immediately want to go get this book to learn more.  Our extrovert happy society doesn't even realize the hurtful impact we are having trying to keep getting those damned introverts to engage.  We need to change.  Get this book.  Take action.  Do things differently.  You will wish you had gotten this book sooner.

B009KKLQVS|5.0|How does anyone review a DVD that has not been release? I suppose if you wanted a 50 song DVD it would cost about $29.99 instead of $14.99.<br />I'm give it a 5 Stars because the reviews above clearly were not based on this DVD that had not been released.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|It holds my kindle fire very well, I would pass it on to someone else,I'm very please with the sleeve.Also very compact.
B007MDB548|5.0|Waited patiently for this to be released.  I think it was originally going to be titled Tinkerbell and the Winter Woods or something like that.  We got it Wednesday night and couldn't wait to watch it with my 4 and 7 year old daughters.  We all loved it.  My 7 year old asked me a couple of times if I was going to cry, I wasn't but I loved that she got the emotion of some of the scenes and interactions of the characters.  This movie is absolutely ADORABLE!!!!  I can't wait to watch it again.  This whole Fairy franchise is adorable for young girls.  I really hope that Disney will spend more time creating items like this.  Every movie has been terrific.  Thanks Disney for another adorable movie that is wholesome but completely entertaining!!!!!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great movie my son and I loved watching it. This movie on bluray looks better than in the theater. Thanks again Amazon.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle for Android worked flawlessly as I expected.  With all of the ebook readers out today, Amazon's Kindle product, in any format, just can't be beat.

B009NQKXYK|3.0|Could have been WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better. Missing character building. Dont really know much about the alien it self. Just missing lots of info.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It does just as the description says. Perfect on my Fire. Added to favorites so it's even easier to get to. Much better than tapping the small Icon in the top corner.<br />I love that it tells me how much time I have left for reading, Internet browsing, playing games, listening to music, or watching movies.<br />Perfect app.
B008FYZIVY|2.0|Other than the performance of Maggie Smith, who is brilliant even when sitting perfectly still and saying nothing, this series is a colossal waste of time. Trivial storylines involving petty, uninteresting characters, all of whom should have been killed off in the second-season war.
B007TK77QE|2.0|It was not what I expected from J K Rowling. I wanted mystery and intrigue, at the very least a bit of escapism!!What I got was the life and times of a depressed council  estate resident and the inner workings of the teenage boy!! I could have watched the Omibus of East Enders for that!!
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|So far it is fine. My other one was only a few years old and the coating completely decade.  All the coating fell apart.  I will reserve my full opinion until I see how long this one lasts.  I do appreciate the excellent service I received from Amazon.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is an awesome game it is well worth the 6.99 you have to pay. the Pc version is better but you cant get it on this
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is a great book just like the previous four. I can't wait for book 6! This author writes magnificently. Read this series!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I liked the books because the story kept moving at a good pace and continued through all three books.  The books are very well written.
B0077SGMXM|4.0|good game that allows you to practice holes first to develop strtegy<br />this one makes you think as well as execute! I like that you can simply restart a course if things get out of hand :-)
B008NAFU9A|5.0|Purchased this novella on the advice of a friend. The genre is not one I normally would read.  Be that as it may, I was more than pleased with it.  It was a quick read with a well-written story of struggle and romance. Even if you aren't into the darker side of the story, you can't help but appreciate and enjoy the characters and delivery.  This is an author to keep an eye on!
B008GVD6D8|3.0|ok but not fifty something missing not sure what but is worth a_look will wait for th next one! Maybe it will be better
B0006J28BO|4.0|This film manages to be action filled and sweet at the same time. Another great Studio Ghibli film with several characters reprising their roles from Ghibli's \\"Whisper of the Heart.\\"
B004GJDQT8|3.0|Works great on my Samsung GS3 but isn't compatible for Tablet.  I have an ASUS Transformer Prime with Jelly Bean 4.1  There's no reason for amazon not to have one compatible for a tablet since it is still considered a Mobile Device. 5 stars when they make one.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series is nothing short of epic. With sweeping shots, amazing closeups, wonderful narration, and beautiful music, this series did a fantastic job showcasing some of the most amazing sights in the natural kingdom.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|The best tv series ever!!! Nobody can live without the Walking Dead Experience. Not only the zombies are dangerous in this season
B006N57PXG|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. There was a lot of wonderful humor  and sarcasm. Bartimaeus was an excellent character and I can't wait to read the next book.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|This played out more like a generic horror film than I would prefer, but it was solid entertainment. The characters take a lot of risks that don't make sense and the plot seems rushed.  The special effects and some of the ideas presented make the film worth a watch, but don't expect a return to the greatness of the original Alien/Aliens.  If you aren't an Alien fanatic and you go in with low expectations it might surprise you.  I don't think I will add the movie to my collection unless they make up a lot of ground in the inevitable sequels, but definitely worth the rental.
B00902MCVY|5.0|This album is different than the self title and that's a good thing because if I want to hear the \\"2004 Wintersun\\", I can just pop that sucker in. Time one is a masterpiece in its own way just as the first album. Yes it isn't fast, aggressive, and doesn't feature solos like winter madness but the melodies are amazing the orchestration are mind blowing. Besides, we all know Jari can play a mean guitar. After 8 years, we're lucky the project wasn't abandoned. I feel Wintersun delivered a solid album and it was definitely worth the wait
0743244257|1.0|A sophomoric, cliche-ridden and financially illiterate portrait of the investment world. Probably the worst novel I have ever tried to read. I gave up a quarter of the way through.
B0064W652A|5.0|Awesome read! I'm new to reading comics, but if there are any more of this standard then I will enjoy looking for them! The art work was nothing short of beautiful, and I was completely hooked on the story from start to finish, truly worth every penny!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some of the games are very addicting!!!!! There are a lot of fun games in this package deal of games!!!!!! Love it!!!!!
B000SEFNMS|4.0|Curiosity relating to  McCandless' adventures led to several reads.  Enjoyed the history and author's personal journeys.  Interesting.  Worthwhile reading for many.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Who doesn't like Angry Birds. Even my best friend that is over 50 had to laugh at it. So be a kid again and play
B008BM9L72|4.0|Here are a series of books that I will only ever read once.<br />My main reason for saying this, may be the five full days (120 hrs) of reading involved, unless you can speed read which most of us cannot do.<br />That being said, I have to congratulate E L James for a history defining book that separates the the adult fiction and pornographic categories. This book I would classify as adult fiction.<br />With the benchmark set, new work will evolve to satisfy the avid reader such as myself.<br />Fifty Shades of Grey is the real deal, it set the boundaries for a good intro into Fifty Shades Darker which I enjoyed more. There were five stars until I entered the final book.<br />Fifty Shades Freed was the most disappointing, it was, I felt, drawn out with detailed family matters and too short on detail with the villains.<br />I found this a frustrating form of added torture, how could you E L! 51 shades of Grey not 50.<br /><br /> (: P J Fellow author :)
B0073LWEXK|4.0|My grandsons like this game. They like looking for the hidden pictures. It is fun to watch them play the game.

B004SUWR2C|4.0|The kids love to get on my kindle fire and play this game. The best thing is they can play it alone.
0316044695|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It reveals, in great detail, what the brave men of the Navy go through each and every day for us; from the training, to the fighting, to the friendships, to the sense of comradeship of leaving no man behind. Each character introduced holds a special place in your heart. You cry, you laugh, you wonder, and you are inspired. Regardless if you have friends or family in the military, you share the devastation, the loss, and the joy with each and every one of the characters in this book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Sometimes you don't want to sit and just watch television. So to keep my hands busy this is a fun game to play.

1607066017|5.0|First, this is a beautifully illustrated TP with lush captivating backgrounds.  The relationships and character interactions are fresh and engaging.  This is storytelling at its finest there are so many interesting back-stories that unfold organically.  The story really sucks you in and leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />There is nudity and violence so if you don't like either don't read.  I did not find either gratuitous some settings make sense to show both. Though the star-crossed lover plot can get a bit tired I actually quite enjoyed this fresh take on it.  I found the characters real with varying voices and great dynamics.  I will definitely be  continuing the journey with this unique family.

B006LR0XLM|5.0|Perfect! Makes transference of files so easy and simple. I use it on my phone to get music on there without having to remove the sd card. Perfect for sharing files as well
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|This album reflects Fiona's continued growth as a lyricist and musician. Every song is beautifully crafted. The melodies and rhythms are mostly upbeat, but as with previous albums, the lyrics often reflect a profound sense of loss, separtion and alientation...loving and wanting to be loved. This is a somewhat painful album to listen to at times, as with many of her previous works. But if you like her previous efforts, then you won't be disappointed. I only wish that she wouldn't wait 5 years between records, but at the same time, I respect her patience and ability she takes to craft her art. A true 5 star record, perfect, a future classic.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Well written. Different for a zombie book. This book got me excited for the movie with brad pitt next summer
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Breaking Bad season one, in only seven episodes, shows what a great television show can be. But it's not just great,it's superior to anything I have ever seen on TV and is probably better than 90-95% of any movies that come out in a given year, no exaggeration. Before I even saw the last episode I ordered season 2 hahaha. A great buy, really.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is pretty amazing. It's a challenge and if you're patient you can open up tons of new stuff. The storyline is well written. The graphics are fantastic. Kudos to the creators, well done! I can't. believe it's free...I'm hooked! I will tell all my gamer friends.

B0096C7QF0|5.0|Not too many people have heard of Joe Bonamassa. Hopefully that will change soon and he will get the recognition he so rightfully deserves. This man is a guitar legend. If you love Rock-Blues Guitar you must listen to Bonamassa. He will not disappoint.
0307720950|4.0|For readers coming in with expectations  based on a very informative read in [[ASIN:B001PTG4BO The Long Tail, Revised and Updated Edition: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More]]and [[ASIN:1401322905 Free: The Future of a Radical Price]], this book will end up being closer to the \\"Free\\" book in terms of new insights.  The overenthusiastic extrapolations of his own experiences with DIY kits that eventually led to a successful company (with a series of serendipitous events that one cannot expect to be generalized) and variations of crowd-funding models does make an important point - technologies are emerging (or emerged but not scalable yet) that can significantly start leveraging the \\"long tail\\" effect of demands.  That assertion seems plausible enough.<br /><br />In a sense, the book reads primarily as a follow-on to the long-tail discussion - except this time more focused on the means of production than the demand itself. Anderson makes the argument that with the emerging technologies (he is a major fan of 3D printing) DIY-ers and entrepreneurs will be able to side-step the economics of scale and frame production as a \\"rentership of production means\\" as opposed to controlling them.  The implicit assumptions of democratization of means of production and a fairly open ecosystem may seem infeasible - but the author does make a strong argument on their behalf.<br /><br />The hyper focus on 3D printing somewhat detracts the message Anderson is trying to convey - though a careful reader can identify that Anderson is using that as an example to make the point on changing paradigms in control of means of production.  Despite that the overall cheeriness of the tone, this is an entertaining read - which will make more sense if you have already read the \\"Long tail\\" - but in either case, one needs to manage expectations on any significant insights as \\"The Long tail\\" provided.  3.5*<br /><br />A later book - [[ASIN:0465009239 The Tinkerers: The Amateurs, DIYers, and Inventors Who Make America Great]] (I am reviewing a ARC now) - takes a different look at tinkerers/DIY movement and makes the argument that tinkerers are a dying breed and suggests ways to change course. {will edit after posting review on above-mentioned book)
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I read all Reacher books until today. Not in the timeline, but I read them.<br />The last 3 books I read in the timeline.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Ever since the ATR-35s came around [ASIN:B00006I51V], we solder this mic to comfortable over-ear headsets with goose necks and use﻿ them for radio drama production because they catch professional TV-studio sound quality. They are suitable for any voice, male bass and female soprano alike, and they are crisp and quite accurate, catching almost no ambient noise. For $17, that's a heavenly deal! Well, if you need a stand mic with 20-20,000Hz frequency response (e.g., for full-ear sound-range or perhaps making your own live [[ASIN:B002OVD5FK Foley Effects]] while voice-acting), I strongly recommend [[ASIN:B0006H92QK Audio-Technica AT2020 Studio Microphone]]. Godspeed!
B001NB3L9C|2.0|When I sold my vinyl version of this album, I never imagined I would be unable to buy an exact replica on CD or MP3. But that's the way it is. While the entire Beatles backlist has been reissued, lovingly restored in the original mono, The Who Sell Out is a travesty, missing some material that was on the original, while being afflicted with lame \\"stereo\\" effects (which cannot be easily removed) such as phasing the vocals between channels.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|This book was not what I thought it was going to be. The switch between so many characters really took away from the actual plot of the book.I also was really excited to read about the mingling of both Greek and Roman, old and new characters. While actually reading the book however, those relationships didn't really seem all that exciting anymore. Taking into account all aspects however, Riordan really is a talented writer.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Being a fan of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series, I was looking forward to seeing this film, but my first viewing in the theater was a bit of a disappointment. Although the attention to detail was wonderful, I found the film to be disjointed. My, how repeated watching has changed that opinion. Its storyline is a more unified whole to me now, and every time I watch it I find myself even more enthralled. The film's a marvelous ensemble piece, despite the prominence of Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey, and I feel about it now the way I do about, well, reading Sherlock Holmes -- every time around may be the same in a sense, for I know what's coming, but I'm with characters I don't wish to part with and want to return to again and again, so every time still seems fresh. And yes, it's about the qualities of leadership and judgement as well. These days I wonder how I could have felt disappointed after my first experience of this film. It's become one of my all-time favorites.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|The plot/storyline was not cohesive.  The movie is way too long with the characters not really coming to life.  Making a movie longer is not making a movie better.  In fact, if the movie is weak, making it longer just makes the point even more (painfully) obvious.<br /><br />I kept watching the movie to see if it would improve but unfortunately that was not the case.<br /><br />Maybe DreamWorks will just move on to another project.<br /><br />Save your money if you intend to buy.  Better rent and save the rest for a better movie.

B00000JFV9|5.0|This soundtrack remains the jewel in Curtis Mayfield's quite considerable crown of compositions. The soulful songs, the propulsive instrumentals; it all flowed seamlessly and brillliantly. An intoxicating musical mix. You didn't have to be a soul or jazz or funk fan to admire and love this music ... but it sure helped! Truly, this is a flawless recording that has held its own over the years ... and decades. Thank you Curtis Mayfield for making so much brilliant music, including this classic soundtrack.
0345803485|1.0|What can I say about this book?  As I was reading it, I kept thinking to myself \\"this is like reading \\"Twilight,\\" except without Edward \\"Tinkerbell\\" Cullen and the rest of the sparkly vampires.\\"  Anastasia Steele is just another Mary Sue, just like Bella Swan; she has no depth, no character development, she's a blank slate, a cipher for the reader to project herself onto.  This series is basically \\"Twilight\\" for older girls (I won't say \\"women\\").  The one positive thing I can say about it (and this is really damning it with faint praise) is it's not quite as poorly written as \\"Twilight.\\"  However, that being said, I found it exceedingly irritating that, throughout the book, the author kept using words that were almost but not quite the word she wanted.  It was like (as Mark Twain so brilliantly put it in his \\"Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses\\" essay) a sort of literary flatting and sharping by an author with a poor ear for words (\\"Use the right word, not its second cousin.\\" ~Twain).<br /><br />So why the extreme popularity of these books then?  I can tell you in one word... SEX.  Seriously, after the perfunctory introductory twaddle, the bulk of the rest of the book is graphic and *lengthy* and super-detailed depictions of sex, with occasional Bella-Swan-ish angsty wafflings tossed in to break up the monotony a bit.  I'm not a prude, and I enjoy a well-written piece of erotica as much as the next red-blooded woman.  However, (a) this is not well-written, and (b) this is not \\"erotica\\" (it's rather the giant super jumbo deluxe scaled-up Costco-sized version otherwise known as \\"pornography\\").  \\"Erotica\\" to my way of thinking about it, should be a few delightful sips, not a 64-ounce Double Big Gulp from 7-11.  Can you see the distinction there?  It's something extraordinary to be savored in small amounts -- any more and it quickly palls and becomes banal and monotonous and uninteresting and mere pornography (ergo, the kinkiness is introduced to try to keep it fresh and interesting -- it doesn't).<br /><br />Do you get that I did not like this book?  Am I making that clear?  However [giant sigh], it's quite likely that I'll read the other two.  I read the entire Twilight series due to its train wreck fascination and I'm feeling a similar fascination for this ineffable twaddle.  For one thing, I can't quite believe that this level of pornographic dreck can be sustained through two more novels.  For another, some little tiny part of my psyche clings to the faint hope that the writing may improve and the characters grow into people instead of cardboard cutouts.  I certainly won't *pay* for the two subsequent books tho!  LIBRARY!!!d interesting -- it doesn't).<br /><br />Do you get that I did not like this book?  Am I making that clear?

1619691825|4.0|I love Nelson DeMille's writing.  I very much enjoyed the Panther, especial towards the end.  I did find The Lion was much more interesting and had more action.  If the true culture of Yemen is as described, I found this very interesting.<br /><br />I would avoid the unabridged version of the Panther as it was a little to long and got to be boring.  I just kept anticipating more....<br /><br />I can't wait for the next Nelson DeMille book!
B004XKVPG6|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband who loves this movie.  We use to have this on DVD but it stopped working because he's watched it so many times.  It's a very suspensful movie about the seven deadly sins.  It's got Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey in it.  I have to say, this is one of my favorite Kevin Spacey movies.  He really does an excellent job in this movie.  If you like suspense movies, than I would recommend it but I will admit it's gorey so be aware of that.
B008QLXSG8|1.0|I am afraid that, as much as I love the book, I do not appreciate the limitations put upon this particular edition (Kindle) by way of DRM. How much of a problem DRM is, may vary from user to user, but I would have appreciated it if Amazon had informed me about it in advance of my purchase, as I would then have chosen a different edition (hardcover) where I OWN the book and not merely LEASE it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This was an excellent book that carried on from volume without reliving half of the first book.  You quickly are led into the characters and their place in the pace of the book.  There is never a dull moment as each character goes through their delights and burdens.  This, like vol. one, is a MUST read!<br />George Miller
B008O69SZ0|4.0|I'm at a loss for words at describing how impressed I am with Ian Hunter and this fine new album. I almost gave it 5 stars --- I'd give it 4.5 without any qualms --- but I still thought \\"Man Overboard\\" was a notch better so I'm tempering my enthusiasm. That said, I'm still quite excited about this CD; this is a very good, and very moving album, full of passionate rock songs. If you know Ian Hunter's work, you know what to expect, and this doesn't disappoint in the slightest. It boggles my mind that Ian Hunter is now 73 years old and putting out albums as strong as this one ... and still sounding as strong and resolute as he did 30 or 40 years ago. And that's not just flattery, but the honest truth. This guy is an inspiration! I want to follow the Ian Hunter anti-aging plan! If you've enjoyed any of Ian Hunter's solo albums, or even the Mott period, you need to hear this one too (not to mention the other excellent solo albums he's recorded in the last decade). What an amazing streak this man is on. Keep it up, Ian!

0385535147|4.0|I have been looking forward to receiving Grisham's latest since it was offered for pre-order earlier this past summer. When I received it just two days ago, I was ready and hopeful, and read it with few interruptions.<br /><br />The story is entertaining and moves along quickly. The basic plot concerns an attorney, Malcolm Bannister, who is (according to him) unfairly incarcerated simply because he happened to pick the wrong client to represent, and in so doing he becomes swept up in a larger federal crackdown of his clients network of crimes.<br /><br />Halfway through a ten-year stretch in a low-security prison, he is passing the time by taking care of the prison library and acting as an unofficial advocate for his fellow inmates, helping them where he can in filing appeals and providing other legal advice. While he is in prison, a federal judge is killed. Soon thereafter, Bannister contacts the FBI and tells them that he knows where they can find the judge's killer. He'll give them the information, for a price, of course - his freedom.<br /><br />There is more to this than simply trading turning over a killer in order to obtain his own freedom. Bannister is also intent upon avenging his own wrongful conviction and making the FBI and the feds pay (so to speak) for the wrong that they had committed to him.<br /><br />Well crafted and with a few good surprises and twists and turns, it has the trademark Grisham cleverness with Bannister's irreverence contrasting nicely with the seriousness and lack of ingenuity on the part of the feds. In fact, the law enforcement types who are present in this story are barely flushed out and play minimal roles. The story is all focused on Bannister and his scheme to gain his freedom as well as secure his future (the ill-gotten gains that had motivated the judges death eventually clarify what Bannisters real motivation has been). And Bannister flying back and forth from the Carribean reminds me of [[ASIN:0440245923 The Firm]], where Mitch (and later his wife) travel to the Cayman Islands to copy the documents that they hope will save them from the crooks of Bendini, Lambert & Locke.<br /><br />Still, the Racketeer lacks the tension and suspense of The Firm, and it also does not have the surprise ending of [[ASIN:0345531981 The Summons]]. Grisham's best novels have had complicated and interesting plots that involved rich characters who were stunning in their brazen disregard for the law and their ability to skim off vast sums of money in doing so - remember Max Pace in [[ASIN:034553199X The King of Torts]]? At this point is it unrealistic to expect each new Grisham novel to reach such a high bar?<br /><br />Here, the story works well and it is an entertaining read. I suppose I consider it to be a 3 1/2 star overall, because it is enjoyable and well crafted. Not his best, just above average for John Grisham, but still better than most other writers these days.Mitch (and later his wife) travel to the Cayman Islands to copy the documents that they hope will save them from the crooks of Bendini, Lambert & Locke.<br /><br />Still, the Racketeer lacks the tension and suspense of The Firm, and it also does not have the surprise ending of [[ASIN:0345531981 The Summons]].

The Litigators is as good as anything Grisham has penned, with an ease of flow to the story telling that draws you into the life's of the many characters. Can't wait to get hold of Grisha ms next novel. Do yourself a favor and read this book, you won't be disappointed.

B009WJX10G|4.0|I've never actually written a review for anything before. After watching this episode then reading all the mostly lousy reviews for it I was compelled to write my own.<br /><br />Most of the bad reviews are because Sam & Dean do not play heavily in this episode. And I get it. I get why people don't like that. But I don't agree with them. Supernatural is in its 8th season and I think the show has earned the right to be a little creative and do something a bit different than the norm. Yes, what makes Supernatural great is the Winchesters and I wouldn't want to have them as \\"secondary\\" characters all the time. But having an episode like this one was a nice departure for them (and even could set up a later episode or two by bringing Kate back if she \\"falls off the wagon\\", so to speak). Also, it was nice to see Dean agree that she didn't need to be hunted down and killed because she was now a \\"monster\\". (Especially, since he formerly betrayed Sam over this same issue when he killed Sam's childhood girlfriend for being a monster). That gave Dean a nice moment to contrast with the new \\"warrior\\" Dean that came back from purgatory.<br /><br />All I'm saying is that after 8 seasons, all of which in my humblest opinion have been good solid stories, the creative minds behind Supernatural should be handed some slack. They've pretty much given fans what they've wanted out of this show and they should be able to pursue some creative license every now and again. I personally think the episode was solid and interesting. Don't let the bad reviews deter you from watching it and take it for what it is: one episode in a show that tells the story of the Winchesters and their hunts. In that respect, it does what it sets out to do. And I think it does it in a clever and creative way.

It has great survival skills in it in case anything were to happen. There are very detailed descriptions on what you need and why you need it. It even goes into telling you items that you may think would be a good idea to have may not be the best. On top of that, it's an entertaining read if zombies amuse you. Anyone interested in zombies/survival/camping should get this!
B004CD7OCI|2.0|I love zombie stories. Unfortunately, this series is just a soap opera with a few languid individuals walking around eating people. The characters NEVER do things real people would do. They do stupid things. They spend most of their time talking about their personal problems instead of focusing on survival and there are too many \\"gimme a break\\" moments. There are moments of brilliance and real terror, and some things are shown that are great. But really -- does ANYONE think that in Georgia it would be difficult for people to find an unlimited supply of guns and ammo? There are scenes of abandoned military vehicles and zombie soldiers everywhere yet all of their guns, ammo, grenades and so on somehow have vanished. Not a single survivor seems to have a military weapon. In addition, in a world where there a billions of dead people, the best these morons can do is continue to drive around in an ancient RV that conveniently breaks down at the most inopportune moments? Gimme a break. This goes on and on and on. The survivors struggle more over their pitiful bed-wetting problems than about the seemingly unlimited number of zombies who only seem to show up at the perfect moments to send the little survivor-ants scurrying around. Seriously. The writers do not give the viewer any credit for intelligence or imagination. If you're going to have a zombie series, at least have the characters do what REAL people would do, not what some writer who needs to move the plot has to FORCE them to do.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|The casting for thisw entertaining and touching story was fantastic.<br />Makes one wonder about his or her own life as we each move towards those Exotic Years.<br />Folks under 50 probably won't enjoy it as much as those of us who are more closely aligned with the characters themselves.<br />Highly recommend this movie.<br />RH

B006DHAT5K|4.0|In What's Your Number?, the very funny Anna Faris plays Ally, a woman who comes across a magazine article saying that those who have had more than 20 lovers have a significantly lower chance of ever marrying. Ally is precariously close to this number and sets off on a quest to see if any of her past boyfriends have evolved into someone worthy marrying. Her neighbor, Colin (played by the gorgeous Chris Evans), helps her seek out her exes, and along the way becomes a closer friend to Ally.<br /><br />Anna Faris is hilarious and I particularly enjoyed her antics throughout this movie. Her past boyfriends are also incredibly funny to watch (including a particularly creepy puppeteer played by Andy Samberg). I thought the chemistry between Ally and Colin was sizzling. As with most romantic comedies, it was clear how they movie was going to end within the first ten minutes of watching. However, I enjoyed it all the same!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I remember spending hours and lots of quarters on the arcade version.

B007OWRBJK|4.0|Pete's memoir is well written and insightful. It is as much more about the music and the times than wild antics of an iconic rock and roll band. Pete seems to be woking hard to position The Who among the great rock and roll bands of the 60s and 70s, while carving out a place for himself as one of the top song writers of the era. Both of these positions are well deserved.<br /><br />More than other books of this nature, this one has caused me to go online to seek out old videos of the band's live performances, and to listen to the recordings with a fresh ear. They are amazing. Tommy is a masterpiece. And, this band was like no other live. As a guitar player, I have also been prompted to explore some of Pete's songs and have gained a greater appreciation for him as a song writer and a musician.<br /><br />This is an interesting book by an interesting character in the rock and roll story, but expect it to be just the beginning of a journey leading to a greater appreciation for the entire body of work that is Pete Townshend and The Who.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|La Futura was a long time coming; nine years from 2003's Mescalero to the 2012 release of this latest disc. They had released some box sets and at least one very good must-see DVD in \\"Live from Texas\\", but the new disc was nearly unexpected. I think that many of us had given up; we hadn't even checked up on 'Top after a few years of airplay silence. It was also not without much trepidation that I purchased the disc (yes; I do hard copies, only) after only hearing one tune on Leno. All too often I have gotten excited about an old-school rocker only to get the disc and get downright depressed; their energy had gone, they were picking at a set of bones so bereft of fresh ideas as to present me with a fairly high-dollar coaster (or BB target, depends upon how bad...) in a nice jewel case with some photo-shopped artwork. Very happily not so with ZZ Top's La Futura. Most of the tunes ooze with the boogie-based gritty and gutsy experiential, no-nonsense energy that Top fixed us up with from the beginning. Not as thick and heavy as Rhythmeen and not as synthesizer stuffed as Eliminator, La Futura has its own energy and mood, as do most ZZ Top discs. There are a couple of surprises in slower, sweeter ballad-like tunes that I didn't think I'd like, until I found them stuck in my head! The bulk is that raunchy boogie that I have come to crave, and this fix was long overdue!

0307960471|4.0|For someone who thought of Norway as deep fjords and Olympic ski jumps, Jo Nesbo's latest Harry Hole \\"Phantom\\" is a jarring crash into a brutal Scandinavian reality.<br /><br />A scarred Harry Hole returns from Hong Kong to help his ex-girlfriend's drug-addicted son Oleg, who has been arrested for the murder of his junkie friend. Hole scratches at the dirty surface of what should have been a simple police case and finds that it is much more than that: Ex-Soviet gangsters, a powerful new drug flooding Oslo's streets, police and municipal corruption linking back to the drug trade. But as an ex-cop, he must now tread much more lightly as he rebuilds burned bridges with antagonistic cops and tries to stay well ahead of an enemy who knows he is in town and is a serious threat.<br /><br />\\"Phantom\\" starts off slow but once the characters and story is in place Nesbo takes off and the reader is taken on a twisting ride of action and intrigue. It doesn't take long. Once Harry gets really involved in the case his foot is slammed onto the story's gas pedal and it gets really hard to look up before the book is done.<br /><br />Jo Nesbo writes a great story. He also serves to open a window into contemporary Norway, exposing a rough side of Northern Europe that many readers outside of Scandinavia may not have been expecting.

B009AMAM9S|3.0|The past, present, and future all intertwine to tell one incredible and ambitious story in \\"Cloud Atlas.\\" Six different time periods and settings (The Pacific Ocean in 1850, Cambridge in 1936, London in 2012, Neo Seoul in 2144, and Big Isle 106 winters after the fall) and cast members portraying multiple roles, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is ridiculously complex and quite possibly the most fantastic event to happen to cinema in quite some time.<br /><br />The individuals who have read or are at least familiar with the source material seem to be at an advantage. Speaking as someone who didn't read the book, certain things didn't add up or make a whole lot of sense. During the entire Big Isle setting, everyone has this strange dialect that is difficult to comprehend at times. David Gyasi mumbles through why he dreams of proving himself as a first class seaman as Autua, a self-freed slave, in 1850. You miss a lot of the more important background information regarding his character because of it.<br /><br />Given the length of the film (it clocks in at 172 minutes), you may find yourself dreading another visit to the film unless you were one of the people who absolutely adored it. On the bright side, a film with this much material is bound to have secrets and hidden gems tucked away in every corner that you were bound to miss the first time through.<br /><br />Some of the settings and characters are much more enjoyable than others. The Big Isle setting at least plays a big role in the long run, but the London setting starts off really strong and then turns into the weakest offering of the film. Tom Hanks as Dermot Hoggins is easily the highlight as his English accent and over the top actions are the first thing to really catch your eye at the start of the film, but his character isn't used again after the opening sequence. It revolves around Jim Broadbent's Timothy Cavendish being sent to a retirement home and him trying to escape the clutches of dominant Nurse Noakes (portrayed by Hugo Weaving). It's the one setting of the film that offers this weird slapstick sense of humor that just doesn't seem to mesh well with everything else going on. Maybe it's something that was just more enjoyable in the book.<br /><br />While most of the actors portray a wide spectrum of characters (Tom Hanks plays a doctor who's poisoning a man just to get to his valuables, a doctor who falls for a journalist, a greasy hotel manager, and a violent English author; as an example), Hugo Weaving is basically the same character in every setting. The most vile and unlikeable character is always him throughout the film. Nurse Noakes is scary though and it's not because of the way she's written. It's because of her appearance and the way your brain stumbles to comprehend just what the hell that thing is the first time you look at it.<br /><br />While \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is visually impressive in a massive way, the stories are expertly and flawlessly woven together, and it's a sci-fi film that's magnificently bold and breaks boundaries, its nearly three hour duration is daunting. There certainly may be a cult classic buried deep within this cinematic version of 7 layer dip, but repeat viewings may be difficult for the average viewer. Lana and Andy Wachowski and Tom Tykwer have something incredibly unique and stupendous on their hands, but whether or not the average theater-goer will have any interest sitting through a three hour epic that spans six different timelines let alone paying ten dollars to see it remains to be seen.ugo Weaving).

B009CCBCU4|5.0|Review of The Highlander by Zoe Saadia<br />Rise of the Aztecs Book 1<br /><br />If you've read any of Author Zoe Saadia's \\"Pre-Aztec Series,\\" you know to expect a combination of historical education with a smoothly-written, exciting story involving empathetic characters who maintain the reader's interest throughout. The first of this new series, \\"The Highlander,\\" proves to be no exception. Immediately we get involved with the story of two boys (and one half-sister), one a Highlander, one a Lowlander, as they follow the dictates of their families, disparaging each other's ethnicity, yet learn to value their growing friendship. It is no coincidence, perhaps, that these two will prove to play pivotal roles in the changes to come for their societies and the empire across the lake.<br />Suffused with thrills and adventure and romance as well as character development, this novel paints a vivid illustration of a society long lost to us, but yet in many ways so like our own, with characters who could be us or our friends or neighbors. The human condition does not change much despite technology and the Industrial Revolution. My recommendation: read and enjoy!<br /><br />I reviewed an e-book copy provided by the author in return for my fair and impartial review.

I was smitten with both immediately. Loved the entire cast and the directing was superb. Mind you it's not your typical Hollywood movie. It's way too creative! I like movies that sweep you away and make you forget everything else while watching them. This is one of those movies. You will laugh out loud, feel sad for parts of it, and you will get attached to the characters. What creative minds to put such a movie together. Keep in mind that you can't miss even a minute of it- to keep up with the plot and the characters. You haven't seen a movie like this before. Two thumbs up and a wink!!!

They are not they are the original ones we saw the very first  time it aired..which is the ones that made us love Friends in the first place.

But at least we are getting Friends with a much needed blu-ray upgrade(the first few seasons on dvd look horrible.) the way we first saw them. NOT THE EDITED SYNDICATED VERSIONS.
B000W4D94I|5.0|This is a pretty good movie as far as Disaster type movies go. The Blu-Ray is quite nice I think. Better than a lot of movies I've seen. The special effects were pretty good too. I can't really comment on the audio too much as I listen with external speakers hooked up to my tuner. Nothing fancy, but the sound is fine with me. Another good thing is the aspect ratio of 2:40:1 which lets you see the entire movie from side to side on your tv screen. People are always complaining about the black bars on the top & bottom of the film in this type aspect ratio. I want to see the whole film if I can & if you're into the movie you shouldn't notice the black bars, especially against the black tv frame. Overall I would say go ahead & get this if you're thinking about it. The price was right & the quality was really good too.
1451695195|1.0|The bait is the promise of a book on the \\"Afterlife\\".  The switch is a book about how smart the author is and how great his family lineage, and not much else.<br /><br />For example, he makes some extraordinary claims: \\"I saw the abundance of life throughout the countless universes, some whose intelligence was far advanced beyond that of humanity.  I saw that there are countless higher dimensions.\\"<br /><br />So where are the details of what he saw?  Not in this book. Those sentences are pretty much all you get.<br /><br />The author then gets defensive and writes a disclaimer that, while the knowledge the author gained in the heavens is massive and sound, he cannot access this knowledge.  Huh?  Perhaps the author is saving the details for the sequel in the upcoming \\"Proof\\" trilogy.<br /><br />Check out Brinkley's \\"Saved by the Light\\" instead, which is far more interesting and better written.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|It was exactly what I expected no more no less. The Romans were the ruthless and so was a gladiators. I don't know how true the history is about this but expected to be somewhat accurate the Romans was and where the Nazis of that century and the gladiators were the freedom fighters. I what I did not expect was all the open sex scenes. There in the series quite dismissive. Sometimes it boggles imagination, but overall good entertainment be it fiction or actual it looks me the history never seems to disappoint me seems to repeat itself over and over again. I guess that's because were all human and man is one of the ruthless creatures out there. We are war own worst enemy. That's only way I can look at this and say that God have mercy upon our souls.<br /><br />Sincerely<br />Carol D Akers
B0083V2W6I|5.0|I originally saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out.  As an avid Who fan, I still consider Quadrophenia their greatest accomplishment, and as I am about to see them perform it live, I thought I'd see the movie again after all these years.<br /><br />It's a terrific movie, very well done, and it stands on its own even if the music did not also tell the story.  However, I have to say I was disappointed with the ending, which was changed from the original ending on the Quadrophenia album, which is more powerful and compelling.<br /><br />In the movie, Jimmy, who has been tipped over the edge, rides his scooter along a high cliff while the hard driving music and lyrics reflect his state of mind.  The director does a good job making you nervous, wondering if he's going to speed that bike right off the cliff.  And he does, but the way it's shot, you don't know if he jumped off before the bike went flying.  The bike smashes to the ground, and the credits start rolling.  The song used for this ending is not the same as the finale on the album, and it is one about Jimmy's angst.<br /><br />Now, this is true to the original Who ending in one aspect -- the audience doesn't know if Jimmy lives or dies.  But on the album, Jimmy, tipped over the edge, grabs a boat and rows out to sea in the rain.  He gets out on a rock, thunder and lightning and rain reflecting his turmoil as the music calms down.  Then we have Jimmy standing alone on the rock in the middle of the sea, the boat has drifted off, and the song, \\"Love Reign O'er Me\\" sung by Daltry at his most passionate, reflects his inner self as the 4 sides of his personality are integrated.  The very last word sung is Daltry, right on pitch, shrieking at the top of his lungs, \\"Lu-u-u-u-u--u-u-u-v...\\" -- the music becoming discordant with crashing cymbals and other dissonance as he holds that last note.  Then it all calms down, and we don't know if Jimmy lives or dies.<br /><br />I guess the director thought that wasn't dramatic enough for film as the drama is in the music, but it is far more poignant and moving, and to my mind, there is much more drama in a storm and that music with an isolated lost soul screeching to the heavens and the sea for love than in the way the movie actually ends.  I feel cheated that I didn't get to see the original ending dramatized in this way.<br /><br />Otherwise, great movie.<br /><br />All in all, I prefer the Quadrophenia album with the accompanying short story. Pete Townshend really didn't need a movie to tell his story -- Quadrophenia as rock opera is really that good.

B0041G67VU|5.0|I waited a while for this to come down to an affordable price. I had not seen it in many years, & I saw it on VHS tape. Wow, does the Blu-Ray look nice. The best way to watch this movie I think. It's a pretty good Disaster movie, if you like this sort of film. I'm glad they had the brains to put it in a 2:35:1 aspect ratio & not a 1:85:1, which would have cut off the sides of the movie. These movies with a lot of outdoor scenes really need to be in the 2:35:1 or 2:40:1 aspect ratio to really get the sense of the surroundings. I don't believe there were any extras for this film. It would have been ok to have but I mainly wanted the movie. I enjoyed it & don't get tired of re-watching it at all.
1932100385|5.0|This is hands down the most comprehensive and compelling book on nutrition that I've ever read.  I enjoyed it so much, I read it twice - back to back.  It has provided great insights into the typical American diet (what's wrong with it and how it has come to be).  I've already enthusiastically recommended this book to many in my family and have significantly changed the way I approach my own nutrition.  Note: I listened to the audio book version, which lacks the charts and figures that are helpful.  However, I think the information is easier grasped by listening.

1469984202|4.0|I saw the similarity between the two authors a few chapters into Wool: namely, that they're storytellers first and writers second. Howey's prose, every once in a while, gets away from him and in front of the story. The world he creates and the story he has chosen are well crafted enough that this is forgivable. I cared about the characters, who were fully realized and believable, and I always believed the plot machinations, although I had to stop to convince myself a few times.<br /><br />It kept me turning pages, I enjoyed it, yada yada. Definitely a very good book, just not a great one. It misses any kind of transcendence...prose, insight into to the human condition, technical perfection, whatever...to make it truly great.<br /><br />And it'll make a fun movie, which I'll see as soon as it comes out.

B0058YPGVQ|5.0|If you've gotten the best deal in entertainment, that is Netflix, and have watched the first three seasons of SOA, then you must have Season 4. If you are debating with yourself whether or not it's worth shelling out the $30 to get season four, let this be a conclusive answer that you have to watch it. In my opinion, it has been the best season to date, with the right combination of suspense, action, and drama--even more exciting than the current season. I will tell you that I took me about 3 weeks to get through the first three seasons, it took me about 2 and a half days to get through season 4. If this doesn't convince you that you need to watch season 4, then I don't know what will.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is very addicting. I have to play it everyday and once I start I can't quit. well worth the download. I would recommend it for all ages
1401322786|5.0|I really enjoyed Mitch Albom's \\"The Time Keeper\\". This well written fable takes the reader on a journey through time from beginning to end that is at times beautiful and sad. It keeps the reader engaged, is thought provoking and left me with tears of joy in the final pages. I highly recommend this book.
0399157565|1.0|Cornwell's Scarpetta books have always had their flaws, like Kay's enemies never getting their comeuppance, and Kay's addiction to being betrayed and the world champion victim even as she is supposed to be so awesome smart and powerful. Other annoyances are continual buildups to climaxes that never happen, for example Marino threatening to stroke out over every little thing, and Lucy's non-stop drama over nothing (geez Lucy is obnoxious), and characters and subplots that get introduced, are a big deal, and then are dropped and never resolved. But the complex plots, good action, and complex trails of clues were enjoyable and interesting. Then along about \\"Point of Origin\\" the Scarpetta series slid off the rails and never made it back. Benton Wesley died, but then miraculously came back in \\"Blow Fly.\\" But in the interim anything that was halfway interesting about him was lost, and he became a stiff wooden bore.<br /><br />In \\"Blow Fly\\" Cornwell changed from writing in the first-person from Scarpetta's viewpoint to a weird present-tense third person. It's a rambling shapeless stream-of-consciousness, and \\"Blow Fly\\" is the last Scarpetta book I read to the end. I've tried every one since, and they all lose me in the first few chapters.<br /><br />\\"Bone Bed\\" is billed as a comeback, a return to the old Scarpetta, Cornwell getting back on track. Nah. Don't think so. It's back to first-person Kay, but it's still rambling stream-of-consciousness. It starts out with Kay working alone in her sleek new office, and she's all agitated and freaked out because it sounds like someone is prowling in the building, and nobody else is supposed to be there. So does she get up and look? No, she just sits and frets. Then Lucy comes in, and Kay freaks out some more. Then Lucy is just as unpleasant as in all the other books. Why is a major character so unlikable? She overcame considerable obstacles to become a success, and is brilliant and beautiful and can buy cool toys like hot cars and helicopters. She should be a fun character we can root for. But no. She's just plain awful.<br /><br />I wish a strong editor would rein in the worst of Cornwell's ramblings, bring some focus, and get this series back on track, because it's obvious she is talented and highly imaginative. I miss the old Scarpetta.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|I found this thoroughly enjoyable and informative. While the second half of the book struggles a little to keep the research as conversational sounding as the first half (a huge and probably impossible feat anyway), overall the book manages to pack a lot of well-researched, non-biased information that is relatively easy to read. Excellent and a breathe of fresh air amidst all the typical ballsy rubbish there is out there that extols the virtues of being an extrovert to the detriment of everyone and everything else.
1451695195|5.0|My grandmother past away four weeks ago. I ordered this book because I wanted to hear a scientific version about what could have happened to her.<br />I really hope that this is what happens to all of us because it's a very beautiful story.
B0073XV2W2|4.0|Technically brilliant once again.  Mr. Suarez takes us on another tech journey that makes you think.  Pacing was very good.  My desire to keep reading was good.  Always a good book when you want to read it instead of doing just about anything else.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|It took me a while to get into all the characters but once I sorted all the family's out I couldn't wait to find out what happens to them all A really good read
0316212377|2.0|I have been a big fan of the Culture series but this book left me cold. The principal (humanoid) character was boring. Banks seems to have some sort of fetish about her four arms, which were a modification to allow her to play a very difficult atonal composition for a weird musical instrument requiring four arms to play it. He reminds the reader about her arms all the time, but never really gets into her head. Why she was so obsessed with playing it is never really explained. Her species, the Gzilt, are in the process of Subliming, removing themselves to another awesome dimension, or set of dimensions. Or something.  Their motivation in doing so is not explained very well, either. Lots of evil intrigues accompany this process, none of which make any sense. The Culture Minds play a big role in the book but after reading another review favorably (!) comparing Banks to Douglas Adams, they just seemed too precious for words. The usual awesome tech and space opera themes are in here but they don't impress this time. Maybe twelve books is enough for the Culture series and Banks should turn his impressive talents to something new. Unfortunately, since he is guaranteed to make money with any Culture book, he will most likely take the line of least resistance and grind out another one, which is undoubtedly in the works.  Better luck next time, Mr. Banks.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This was a surprisingly great movie. The picture quality was amazing, too. I love that I rented this movie without leaving the couch! You can't beat that!!
034580404X|4.0|I really enjoyed the characters in this book besides the wild chemistry they had between themselves. I like the suspense that was thrown in for good measure as well. All in all, a great book in my opinion :-)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|how can I possibly get past solid walls all along the bottom? nothing destroys them. I'm upset I cant finish the game after playing so long & I really love the game. I don't want to start over. HELP!!!  Never mind. I figured it out! The pieces can fall off the 2 end columns. I changed my rating to 5 stars because I LOVE this game!
B004G8QTS4|4.0|I am new to the Don Winslow world of SoCal and this is only my second book (the first being The Kings of Cool).  In no time at all, he has become my favorite author.  The stories are just a bit edgy with very likable, well developed, characters. The pace moves well and I found myself staying up way past bedtime to get another (couple of) chapters in. I'm really looking forward to his other works as well.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I have to be in the mood to listen to Josh Groban. Once that mood strikes, it's very hard to remove me from it. I find myself having to listen to him over and over again.<br />This young man has the voice of Angels. He touches the very depths of souls with this CD.  I call him the male version of Barbara Streisand. Such quality is a rare gift.<br />Anyone owning his previous endeavors will not be disappointed with his new works.<br />He leaves me time and time again longing for more.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I wasn't sure if this could match the last one but it did. It was well paced and the characters all got to have good piece of the action. The only negative is that now I have to wait for what will seem like forever to read the next one!
030758836X|5.0|I read a lot of mysteries, but \\"Gone Girl\\" took a new twist.  It told the story from both protagonist's view, allowing you to get into the minds of both the husband and the wife.  The author put a lot of time into delving into the two personalities. By the end of the story though impressive layout, I was a little frightened of the mind of the author. It was a slow start, but it quickened in the middle, and at the end, I could not put it down until finished.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I got this app because another app I have says if I get to level four it will give me twenty free big win bucks

B0097EWK3A|5.0|Awesome I love to play mystery finds! More games should be like this game. The storyline was full of mystery and made me want more.
B0093URN4E|5.0|This album blew me away. There is not one Converge album that sucks they are all amazing and so emotional! ALL WE LOVE WE LEAVE BEHIND is so powerful it packs all the punches and then some. I just saw them live recently and they played songs off this new album and it was amazing even better live. These guys have heart a lot of HEART and one of the best Hardcore bands to this day!<br /><br />Keep up the good work boys! XX
1574214276|5.0|I have several Zentangle books and thus far this is my favorite. What I like about this one is the number of step by step instructions for creating different tangles. If you are an experienced tangler and already know how to do them all then this might not help you but if you are a beginner or intermediate tangler this is a very instructive book. I also like the inspiration piece included with each tangle of someone else's experience. A very nice introduction to the why's and background of Zentangle. Good explaination of tools, supplies and shading tips. Well worth getting
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is the best game ever I wish I could play it all night but I cant .it is a big bummer.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I love this movie. I own it on VHS, but alas, no longer have a working VCR. I am so glad I was able to find it on Amazon on DVD. I bought the ultimate edition which included a \\"graphic novel\\" of the movie. It is a terrific edition to purchase...especially for only $10.
0316228532|4.0|If you were expecting something light or fanciful, you will indeed be disappointed.<br /><br />This is \\"Angela's Ashes\\" ala England - a raw, gritty, look at the folks who people a small English village.  The characters are developed with her usual thoroughness, then slowly stripped down to their base selves.  The range is wide, from doctors and civic leaders to junkies and reprobates; from the well-off to those barely getting by.  One has the feeling that Rowling rejects John Donne's pronouncement that \\"no man is an island,\\" in favor of Thoreau's \\"the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\\"  So many of these folks are islands unto themselves, not really known or understood by their spouses or friends.  Even without knowing Rowling's charitable interests, it is obvious that her sympathies are with the children.  By the end of the book yours will probably be there too.
B007X4ECMI|5.0|good B movie.  I read the other simi-negative comments, but, it turned out to be quite good, entertaining.  I think I have more B movies that didnt make a big splash that I like more than some of the headliners.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|First, let me say that I am a huge fan of \\"Castle\\", so I just love the idea that actual books by the fictional Richard Castle are being published!  Just too fun - art imitating life and life imitating art :)  The book was well-paced - kept me coming back for more.  The storyline was complex enough to keep me interested, but not so complex as to become convoluted.  I liked the fact that he actually has a relationship with Nikki Heat in the books - even if it is somewhat on and off.  Waiting to start Heat Rises when I finish the book I am now reading!  Keep them coming!  I want to find out who the real author is!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the clean, attractive and responsive interface. the radar loads quickly and I like the forecast options. definitely recommended.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I am not a math person ! I use this simple calculator to add up numbers and to keep track of my banking deposits\ debits. It beats looking for scrape paper and pens to add a few quick numbers.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this app is awesome. the game is much more challenging than other mahjong games i have played in the past. all in all extremely entertaining app.
B003U80I5G|4.0|This version of Jane Eyre is my most favorite movie of all time.  George C. Scott plays Rochester like no other actor ever could...he is absolutely magnificent and it's easy to understand why he was nominated for an Emmy for his portrayal of the tormented, haunted Rochester.  And, while Susannah York is older than Jane in Bronte's book, she is wonderful in the role as Jane.  Together, the chemistry between Scott and York is wondrous to behold.  Now combine the musical score with great acting, and watching this movie becomes an event, not just a viewing.<br /><br />I agree with others that the quality of this DVD is not the best.  However, I have this movie on VHS and the DVD quality compared to VHS is far superior.  I do hope at some point the movie is remastered again and the quality improved.  However, until then, I shall continue to be enthralled with this movie, this music, this marvelous combination of talented actors and the amazing love story they weave.  This movie captured my heart decades ago and the love spell continues.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case works well to protect my kindle. I like the strap and the way it perfectly fits my Kindle Fire HD. I haven't used the stand part of it much- I'll have to try it.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|i really like this app. I have a place in Florida as well as Indiana. I also have kids in different states. I can quickly put in their zip codes and see what the weather is like there.It is quick and simple to set up and use.
B008220CHO|2.0|This movie is not scary. The opening is the only scary moment with the old lady. I had high hopes after watching that then it went downhill. Basically nothing happens for the first half and once the \\"scares\\" start occurring they are nothing to be scared about as they are old and cliche. Sure it has the typical suspense moments leading up to the moment of terror, but the payoffs are not there! Skip it, nothing special or scary here. If people were terrified from this movie, they must have pissed their pants and wept like infants watching the Paranormal Activity movies...
B008M87GJK|5.0|I have a couple of different news apps on my Iphone, but the BBC app on the Kindle is the best, most accurate and easiest to navigate. I love it!!!!!
B007L6VR6M|5.0|I usually only review older films (especially Criterion re-releases), owing a lot to the banality of Hollywood blockbusters.  So for me to pen a review of a recent film is rare.  But I think that is owing to the quality of this film, and to add one more positive note to the other mostly positive reviews.<br /><br />This is terrific, vintage Anderson.  I wasn't crazy about Life Aquatic, though I can't really put my finger on why.  But Moonrise Kingdom was an enjoyable and lighthearted storybook style tale about two odd youths.  The first thing I want to point out is that the acting is terrific.  Anderson does seem to go for a campy style of film, and the actors all seem to be cast very well.  Edward Norton was my personal favorite in this film as the straight arrow scout leader.  I also enjoyed Bill Murray in his wonderful, yet small role.  And Bruce Willis has been hit or miss for me lately, but he was great in this film.  Folks might forget that he had a great early career with more comedic roles (Moonlighting for example).  And I can't forget to mention a wonderful Frances McDormand as well as a quirky and enjoyable Harvey Keitel in a rather fun role for him.<br /><br />Wes Anderson creates films that seem to be the film equivalent of a modern children's tall tale (at least his last two).  I would imagine that Anderson has a tiny little 6 year old tucked in his mind somewhere that he taps for storytelling.  Or he might just talk to kids a lot, who knows!  But what I know is that these films are grown up, but not in an adult way.  They are a bit more complex than a kids film, and with adult situations (though this one is more lighthearted than Royal Tenenbaums of course).  But I compare this a bit to Fantastic Mr. Fox (amazing film!) and Life Aquatic as well.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer is very clean.  This set has the DVD version as well.  Just be aware that the Ultraviolet copy has several issues.  But any digital media is going to have issues with multiple devices.  And I understand that eventually the digital copy goes away (according to previous Ultraviolet releases).  My question is, why isn't Criterion marketing this?  I thought he had some kind of arrangement with them.  But regardless, the hardware is worthy.  Just don't count on the digital copy as being perfect.<br /><br />I don't think this film is going to appeal to everyone.  But those viewers who want a fun trip through childhood nostalgia will enjoy it.  The acting and direction are spot on.  There are a few slow moments to the film, but there is quite enough humor and just plain silliness to keep the viewer riveted.  I highly encourage purchasing a copy because it makes a great film to watch with friends and family.  Even for those folks who have not seen an Anderson flick, this would make a great introduction to his work.  One of the better, ultimately feel good films of 2012.  Perhaps a couple of Oscar nominations will be had.  Though the film will probably follow the typical Wes Anderson Oscar story: nominated, losing to a film less deserving (Royal Tenenbaums was better original screenplay than Gosford Park - which ripped off 'Rules of the Game' - in my humble opinion).  Is it the best Wes Anderson film?  Perhaps.  But it all depends on your preference.  Lets just agree that it is equally as good as anything he has created.evices.

B0053O89KG|5.0|If you like the television program Castle, you'll love Castle: The Complete Fourth Season.  It is the best yet.  Lots of warm and challenging moments betweem the two stars plus lots and lots of over the wall crime.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|This movie was pretty good, if you like musicals then this was worthwhile for a view. The music is fun and well done, the acting is good and Tom Cruise really does play himself well (lol).<br /><br />That being said, there are some strange things about this movie. First off its conflicting themes. It's glorifying rock, which isn't bad except it's somewhat humorous when they mock boybands and pop yet use such heavy AutoTune for their music. It would be kind of like Glee mocking highschool musical. I just found it somewhat ironic.<br /><br />Their message about fame is actually great. However the weird feel good ending doesn't fit at all with the message that this film was actually developing. They had something good going about fame, and what society does to the famous and then they just kind of threw it out.<br /><br />A few other annoying things: the fundies. C'mon guys this is just so played out. The hypocritical Christians trying to put a stop to things, then surprise surprise surprise they end up with some humiliating event in their past they're angry about. It's just unoriginal. I feel like writers have completely ran out of ideas for bad guys. This film didn't NEED bad guys. If you can't write something original don't write at all.<br /><br />I would have enjoyed this movie more without the autotune (like I said before). This style of music caters more to the mainstream (which... again goes against their theme, but ok). Other than the autotune though they didn't take extensive liberties with the songs, which was nice, there were some really great arrangements in this movie. It was entertaining, somewhat humorous, and only had a few unpleasant scenes.<br /><br />It definitely stretches the limit of PG-13 so keep that in mind with younger audiences.

030758836X|3.0|This book has a good plot and keeps the interest, but why do some authors have to use the \\"f\\" word SO MUCH.  It probably appears on almost every page.  I know that is a popular word nowadays, and maybe I'm just getting old, but I always thought authors had a good command of the English language and creative ways to express their thoughts without resorting to using such words over and over and over.

0618918248|5.0|With The God Delusion, Richard Dawkins, apparent high priest of a new scientific priesthood, takes hold of the reins of intellectual persuasion and power and preaches a gospel utterly free of useless ancient rituals, rivalries, beliefs, and superstitions.  He builds a concrete edifice with bricks and mortar drawn from the plenum of a transcendent nothingness that preexisted the big bang.  As in The Selfish Gene he unintentionally sets the stage for thoughtful inquiry into that transcendent foundational plenum which spawned our cosmos, stars, habitats, life, and human consciousness.<br /><br />Put aside notions of spirit, soul, God as useful but unprovable, unreal. Put aside religious dogmas, theologies, philosophies, metaphysics, history, and everyday experience. Even under sensory deprivation conditions what remains is the sensation and immediacy of consciousness. Patently, consciousness exists, because we experience it.  The recently-published book My Universe - A Transcendent Reality explores human consciousness with the presumption that it is more than  mere self-awareness and that it transcends its physical-neurological manifestation.<br /><br />Dawkins defiantly and brilliantly clears the arena of religious trash but needs being cautioned lest he toss out the baby with the bath water as he espouses Einsteinian religion over supernatural religion.  Einstein's atheism and impersonal God of Nature did after all allow for the ambiguity of a transcendent reality while repudiating a supernatural machinery, a deus ex machina.  The baby that needs to be nurtured and allowed to mature dwells in the notion that human consciousness transcends its material embodiment.  This transcendence of consciousness is currently a subject of scientific study totally and correctly devoid of religious trappings or supernatural connotations.<br /><br />I assume that Dawkins would with humility allow that our imperfect human capabilities permit only a vague glimpse of what Einstein called the magnificent structure of Nature. That structure surely extends beyond the material, the tangible, the measurable  ‒  according to the thesis given in My Universe - A Transcendent Reality.  That transcendent reality is represented in part by the hyperspace manifolds and  mathematical objects conjured by theorists in their attempts to explain the origin and nature of subatomic entities and quantum interactions.  No supernaturally-based belief system sustains this and it putatively persists unaccompanied by religious fervor or dogma.<br /><br />[...]ure of Nature.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is a great book I honestly thought I would hate it (and up to page 80 I did) but after that the book really got quite interesting and I would highly recommend it. If you can burn through those first 80 pages it is worth it. It is exciting, emotional, and suspenseful along with some drama here and there. Great book.
B001P06GX4|5.0|We bought this game last year as a Christmas gift for our 5 year old Daughter. She has problems with staying focused and playing board games helps her focusing and paying attention. We like playing board games as they provide us with fun time as a family. As a plus, It keeps us all entertained and away from the silly TV. It also helps our Daughter developing her thinking and concentration skills. When we bought it, it was much cheaper at Amazon than any other retailer in town. I highly recommend the game!

030758836X|5.0|A great read. If you love a riveting thriller/mystery and superb storytelling---here we are. At last. All the elements are in 4th gear and or overdrive. I read the entire novel flying across country and by the time I landed in NYC I was depressed that the flight and novel had ended. This is the book to read if you have a quiet weekend planned or are going on a trip.

0440246024|2.0|This was a first. I enjoy Grisham's books. But this one fell off hard. Perhaps at 1/3 its length it probably would have held together. It's stretched way too far. I finally quite halfway. Not unpleasant. Just mind-boggingly slow. He's not a deep writer. If he doesn't keep it moving everybody's in trouble. Way slow. Only have so much time in this world.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|I loved the dialogue in this book, especially between Atticus and Oberon.  The action is fast paced, and the story pretty good too.  Overall, very good start to a series, with enough to make you want to read more about the characters!
B006C3Q6GG|3.0|Having enjoyed the movie from which parts of this book were utilized I was interested in learning the backstory of the two main characters.  Overall the book was a good read but there were several glaring faults with it.  My main criticism of the book is that it reads like it was written in a stream of consciousness manner where the author assumes that the reader has a clear understanding of events he has not yet detailed.  Imagine watching a movie on DVD and skipping over chapters and then trying to follow the story line and you will have an appreciation for how this book flows.  It is especially frustrating when the author goes into painstaking detail on events leading up to an engagement only for the chapter to end abruptly.  The story will then continue long after the engagement has concluded.  It leaves the reader unsatisfied and wanting more.  The main skeleton of the story is good, but as for the author's overall ability to tell a concise and enjoyable narrative I felt somewhat disappointed.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. It gives accurate measures on how much time you have on many things. It automatically pops when you plug in the charger and unplug your device. May get a little bit annoying, but I always find myself looking at the other measures. The app looks great, and you can customize the colour of your battery. Thankfully, the app doesn't interrupt what your checking and ask to leave a positive review. Its just a little flashing lightbulb in the corner that I hardly noticed. 5 stars, and keep up the good work smallte!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I thought the premise was good and would make a great movie. The premise was good but the movie took a strange direction. It ended ok but could have been so much better.
1476712042|1.0|If you like reading about a cashmere clad, pearl clutching virgin meeting MMA tatted, muscle bound MENSA brain trust, then this book is for you.***SPOILER*** Good manners require mentioning a fair amount of goodbye sex, makeup sex, reunion sex, good old drunken sex... and some narcissistic hookups.  Sadly, more thought may have been given to descriptive bloodletting fight scenes rather than \\"making the beast with two backs.\\"
B0084IG8TM|3.0|I just completed watching the Hunger Games to see what all the hoopla was about. To be honest, I thought it was ok but it kind of reminded me of a novel and movie years back, by Stephen King called The Running Man only only this movie was on a grander scale.It did keep my interest and I thought Stanley Tucci was outrageously good, However for the most part ,I think it failed to wow me.
B00004R9A4|5.0|I'm not sure what the negative reviews about this DVD version are about--mine was 1.66:1 widescreen, 140 minutes-long-version, fantastic colours, sound synched perfectly, excellent restoration, subtitles, and extras.  A perfect DVD for a quite good film.  What are the naysayers talking about?
B004VMUS9G|5.0|the best part about this app is being able to wake up to my music and start my day with some good tunes...volume crescendo is nifty as well
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a very well written book, thus the four stars. However, the content was disturbing. It had a \\"War of the Roses\\" feel, especially in the last half of the book, a movie which I loved. I think my reaction to the book shows a different place in MY life rather than an ineptitude of the author.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I adored the characters in this story. They were fresh and exciting! Sophia's mom was alive in spirit in her own way. I like a book that can even characterize the dead. I don't just mean vampires either. Hamilton did a great job with delivering information in the story without the use of information dumps. Her dialogue was natural. Everything set up little mysteries and the reveal toward the end was a real shocker! I quite enjoyed the scenes with Thalia and Circe and the scenes at the end with Calista and Marcus. The way the elements and immortals came together in this story was inventive and enjoyable. The backstory on Hamilton's world was intriguing to learn about. The twists at times left me breathless and stirred emotions when normally books don't affect me like that. This isn't a book that will make you cry or scare you but it will make you anxious and make you laugh. It was a nice change from fiction that has been rehashed so many times. If you are looking for something new and writing that won't disappoint then you want to try this book.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|As for Amazon, they rock.  Ordering is easy, item arrives quickly and always in great condition.  As for this product, I've heard so many great things about this series and have wanted to see it for a long time.  It was worth the wait!  The characters are interesting, the plot is attention grabbing and I can't wait for season 2 to come out on Blue Ray.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Whether it's their best, worst or in-between I could care less...I enjoy it!  It's great to hear the current line up putting out some new songs.  At this point people either love KISS or hate them...or maybe they like this era or that album...so it's pointless to argue over who is right and who is wrong.  The bottom line is that KISS has produced a full-throttle and unapologetic album, and I hate to use a cliche but, that's all killer and no filler.  Tommy Thayer really steps up with simple, direct yet catchy solos that embody the classic KISS/ACE sound while still being all his own.  Both he and Eric Singer are assests to the band.  The band sounds great, the only complaints I can voice are that the overall sound quality, while clean, is too LOUD.  (And no, I'm not too old...don't think so anyway...)  Everything sounds overmodulated, which seems to be the norm these days.  The cover art is a cool photo, especially the 3D version at Best Buy (which also gets you some free swag from kissonline,) but it's a major step down from Sonic Boom's excellent, retro-cool artwork.  I think Sonic Boom is the superior album between the two, but this one is getting plenty of airtime in and around my home!
193609648X|4.0|I've crocheted for many more years than I've knitted. I've also found Noro yarns to be incredibly beautiful. In theory, \\"Crochet Noro\\" should be a dream come true.<br /><br />Well, dreams rarely do come true. \\"Crochet Noro\\" clocks in at 144 pages, including the index. As the title states, it contains 30 patterns. The issue comes is with the subtitle of \\"Dazzling Designs.\\" The designs for the most aren't dazzling; they're fairly average. The 2 tunics might look OK on a rail-thin model, but they probably won't look so good on the rest of humanity. Same for the miniskirt. And, really, how many fingerless gloves/\\"wristers\\" do you need? Two sets. Scarves, cowls, capelets and shawls? Um, twelve. Hats? Four.<br /><br />The hats are the one area where the designs look appealing. In fact, they're downright cute. The nesting bowl set is clever. The Granny Square Purse is pretty. Not *original* - you could find a similar pattern in any granny square book - but pretty because of the yarns used. The motif idea (e.g. the cover image) is used often, and not in any way that would be \\"dazzling\\" to anyone who has made a motif or ten. The Felted Tote is, well, a felted tote. The V-neck Pullover is an incentive to improve my knitting (and to try a Noro knitted pullover instead). The Flower Blossom Purse is retro and cute. And if you'd like to try a pattern with beads there are 2 to chose from.<br /><br />I love Noro, and I crochet well, so the book was obligatory for me. The designs aren't \\"dazzling\\" by any means, and apart from a scarf, some hats, a purse and the nesting bowls there isn't much that appeals to me. The hats take best advantage of Noro's yarns and are quite attractive. The scarves are OK. The designs in the book are not complicated, and many of the items would be fairly unremarkable in a blander yarn. Overall a decent effort, but not dazzling. I don't regret buying it, but I'd hoped to be able to give it 5 stars.
B006TLFPKO|4.0|I have loved all the films in the 'Twilight' series. This one is amazing!! I am excited for the final film in the series....
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|It was as great as all the others. It was exciting, but at the same time there were lulls in the perfect places so that I was able to put the book down and go to work or run errands without feeling anxious to rush home and jump back in, but when I decided to jump in I was excited. This book ended a little abruptly (in such a way that this gets 4 and not 5 starts :) ), to call it a cliff hanger might be speaking to literally (har har) but all in all I am still very much looking forwards to the next one!
B004SBQGHS|3.0|Missing latest updates. Keep this app up to date with the latest Play Store version and it will get my 5 stars.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This battery app is a nice little addition to my other apps. I shows the level of life left on your divice. Gives you settings ability and suggestions on how to make your battery last longer. I'm happy I purchased this and recommend it. Chuck TX

B009NQKPUW|3.0|Just another basic Hollywood movie Hyped up as usual. It was good,but not a..l..l..t..h..a..t. Some good affects,but drawn out too long.Worth the watch,but not purchasing the disc.
B004NBY242|5.0|This was one of the funniest movies I have seen in a LONG !! time I highly recommend for anyone in need of a good laugh
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a great game but twice I have purchased diamonds and haven't received them.  I love hidden object games like this.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I have enjoyed 3D films since 1953 . I find several of the new titles extremely entertaining as well as The Avengers , a  very well produced movie . Particularly well done are Prometheus , Puss in Boots , Hugo , Captain America and Abraham Lincoln -Vampire Hunter . Despite not being quite as visually  sharp , Hitchcock's Dial M For Murder , from almost 60 years ago , shows great artfulness in its use of 3D , and unlike so many films today it is very well acted . Almost all of the titles I have seen which are clearly designed for children are good .
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is a game to keep you in a constant play. Once you start all you want to do is get a little faster each time a new game comes up. All ages can enjoy this game. It's great fun for all!
B009WJX10G|5.0|I'm surprised at the bad reviews! Supernatural at its best is a daring show, pushing its characters beyond their and the fandom's comfort zones to tell exciting tales with wit, charm, and AWESOME flair. Throughout history creative minds have found new ways to dress up the same basic ideas -- the animal portion of humanity gone wild, for example -- and this particular episode succeeded in so many ways while including the cheeky cultural references we've all come to love: Hyper self-examination/Blair Witch Trial trope, An American Werewolf in <Location>, (skewering) Lord of the Flies, et cetera. I thought the revelation at the end to be poignant considering everything that's happened in the show's past seven years. If I want to watch Sam, Dean, and Castiel chump about revisiting old times I'll pop in one of my DVDs.<br /><br />AWESOME.<br /><br />Thank you.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this game is very in depth for being an app driven hidden object title. i would recommend it to anyone that likes those hidden object games...and a good story.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I had a hard time getting into the book. I found the up front diary entries of the female character incredibly annoying.  However, I decided to power through given the good reviews of this book.  What a story!  I enjoyed it.  I will admit that towards the end, once the excitement wore off about \\"what's next,\\" the book was just OK.  Either way, it is a good read.
1451620829|2.0|As a KISS fan I have read all the KISS biographies. This is the worst by far. Peter really had a chance to tell his side of the KISS story, and while there were some interesting stories, it failed to live up to the hype. It really just confirmed all the rumors I've heard over the years about him being very hard to work with. It seems that everyone is out to get him. Gene and Paul knew he was the best singer, so they wouldn't let him sing.... He was the most musically talented of the band.... They screwed him over on his pay...His lawyer signed him a bad deal... He does years of drinking and drug abuse, but Paul is out of control, for taking painkillers, before his hip replacement. How dare Ace make more then him. Ect..... This book is one excuse after another, on how the world apparently is trying to screw over Peter Criss.<br /><br />Here's my quick summery, so don't read ahead if you don't like mild spoilers. The first few chapters were interesting, they talked about his early childhood years, which I enjoyed, but thought he kind of just glazed over. Some of the accusations he made, against Ace mainly, were entertaining but considering he admits to being on drugs during them, he may have selective memory at best. He basically goes out of his way throughout the book, to say Paul is gay, but offers no proof. Gene is a money grubbing man whore, who's mother was possibly racist towards Peter. How his first wife was amazing to him, and supported him for years, but divorces her for not being good enough in bed; but is outraged that she used pictures of him 30 years later in a book.<br /><br />I just got sick of reading page after page of this whiny old man. If your songs during KISS were so great, then why have we never heard them? Why has every solo record you've made been terrible and sold little to nothing! You agreed to get paid what you got during the reunion tour, and following tours; No one forced you too sign on. You became a millionaire again and can retire comfortably now, thanks to that tour, but no, you should have gotten more why? Your great positive attitude?. And how Dare Ace get paid 10K more then me? Ace is a drug addict, I only whine and complain about everything, and drink and smoke pot everyday. I know, I'm going to get a gun and shoot those guys in the head, cause i'm a tough 60 year old man, who thinks he was in gangs as a kid.<br /><br />Peter stop complaining, and maybe if you would stop, you could just enjoy your life, instead of coming across as a angry old man, out to hurt people. I really wanted to like this book. But the more I read it, the more disappointing I became. What could have been a great book, and tell a new perspective of the KISS story, became the, Everyone in the world is out to get me, poor me story. Too bad...fortably now, thanks to that tour, but no, you should have gotten more why? Your great positive attitude?. And how Dare Ace get paid 10K more then me?

B006OCM0G0|4.0|I honestly have to say, I miss the old restuarnt story. my kindle said that I needed to update this app, so I did. This new update is horrible!!!! Every time I come on, I get 3 messages. One of these was to rate &quot;5&quot; stars, but I don't see it going to happen. I really want to delete this game, but I love the concept soooooo much<br /> :). I only gave it four stars, because the update just bombarded me with messages. About the part where kids spend things, yes I do understand. But you need to monitor it, and make sure they don't spend anything. BUTTTTT there are thousands of apps out there where kids can buy things, so just don't hats on this game. This was written on the presprective of a 12 yr old. Think<br />Than Comment.

B000002LHX|4.0|According to many interviews the first song Prince learned to play on the piano was the theme to the original TV series of [[ASIN:B005I5C654 Batman]]. So when director Tim Burton approached Prince with the idea of recording the soundtrack to his theatrical version staring Michael Keaton,Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger,he of course jumped at the chance. It's also been discussed that this soundtrack was intended to be recorded half by Prince and Michael Jackson to reflect the Bruce Wayne character's duel nature. Of course knowing Prince and Mikes sometimes aggressively competitive relationship musically,that idea didn't last long. In many ways this film,whose concept very much dealt with something similar to Prince's astrological duality,was a movie soundtrack he might's very well been born to write. The results are quite interesting.<br /><br />  &#34;The Future&#34; is one of Prince's strongest numbers of the era,with a strong house/funk hybrid mixed with a brooding melody and weary lyrics. &#34;Electric Chair&#34;,&#34;Trust&#34; and &#34;Lemon Crush&#34; are very hard edged dance/rock numbers with a lot of intensity,full of loud and often cinematic synthesizers and heavy guitar riffing. The closer &#34;Batdance&#34; throws all this together with it's blend of sampling,house,hard funk and some bone crunchingly loud heavy metal guitar solos. My personal favorite here is the funkiest number &#34;Partyman&#34;,an older Time outtake that Prince sings here in his high pitched &#34;Camille&#34; voice. I've also come to enjoy the mildly psychedelic funk/pop groove of &#34;Vicki Waiting&#34; which reflects the movie plot heavier than a lot of the other songs here.<br /><br />If the two ballads &#34;The Arms Of Orion&#34; is the poppiest and more influenced by the sound of duet partner Sheena Easton's style of slower songs while &#34;Scandalous&#34; is more reflective of the funkier side of Prince's slow jams where he wants to get right to the sexual point with a thrusting beat behind him. From what I've heard about this album it has a rather mixed reception from critics and Prince fans-ranging from it being excellent,mediocre to terrible. Without any particular bias on my part this is one of those Prince albums for those people who gravitate towards the more pop oriented side of his talent. Any musical experimentation here is confined to the context of the songs having catchy and/or memorable tunes to go with them. In a way,it closes out Prince's creatively and commercially red letter decade with the possibility (correct as it turned out) that his next musical project would be another soundtrack but this time to a film of his own directionm what I've heard about this album it has a rather mixed reception from critics and Prince fans-ranging from it being excellent,mediocre to terrible.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Sometimes John Grisham gets it exactly right. The Racketeer joins the list of [[ASIN:B003B02O0A A Time to Kill: A Novel]], [[ASIN:B003B02O3C The Rainmaker]], and [[ASIN:B003B02PFY The Appeal]] of lawyers' lawyer books that delight with every page.<br /><br />Meet Malcolm Bannister, age 43, African-American, and an inmate at a federal work camp in Frostburg Maryland. Five years ago, he was a lawyer in the town of Winchester Virginia, making somewhat of living along with two partners. Overzealous federal prosecutors indicted him for violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, otherwise known as RICO, and when the dust had settled Bannister found himself on the wrong end of a ten year sentence. That Bannister's \\"crimes\\" were essentially illusory is beside the point. A jury, under the gun of the so-called \\"shotgun charge\\" read to deadlocked panels, convicted him and his appeals have run their course. Malcolm is gonna finish out his time, and then return to a world without his profession, wife and kid.<br /><br />There are only two things for an inmate with the skills of Bannister to do-practice a little jailhouse law and scheme to get out.<br /><br />The opportunity for the second comes with the murder of a United States District Judge in Roanoke. Killing a federal judge is a very serious offense. In fact only four sitting federal judges have been killed in our nation's history-all within the last thirty years. I actually appeared before one of those judges Robert Vance of the Eleventh Circuit. A classmate of mine from law school was appointed to represent his assassin and I followed his trial and conviction closely. So when I say as a trial lawyer in the federal courts for thirty seven years that this book is incredibly authentic, I have a substantial basis for that opinion. Lawyers reading this book will recognize the cast of characters from lawyers, inmates, U.S. Marshals, FBI agents, judges and corrections officers. It is absolutely spot on.<br/><br />It is also incredibly imaginative. Grisham always tells a good story, but this one is quite special. Pick it up today.
B00000K3UU|4.0|Purchased this as a gift for my in-laws. Thought it would make a good addition to their at home collection for children/grandchildren to view while there to visit.

B006VGGAC4|3.0|This is a well written historical biography that only minimally addresses recent news of personal matters.  It is respectful in tone but shows significant self-absorption with little self-awareness on the part of the author.  I just kept reading and reading, waiting for some moments of genuine self-reflection and revelation.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was interesting because of the layers of discovery the reader encounters.  This feature made the book a real page turner!

B0083EY9EI|5.0|Amazon suggested this artist to me based on my other purchases and at $5.00 for 15 songs I decided to roll the dice...man am I glad I did.  Emeli is a great artist and after two days, I already have three favorites (Suitcase, Clown, & River).  She's got a (little less jazzy) Chrissette Michelle thing going on and a sound similar to Tamia.  Her CD was a GREAT find for me and I am glad to support an artist like Emeli!
B0031R5K72|5.0|The book has been recommended by a collegue, I bought it before our holiday in Greece.<br />Could not put it down - on the beach in the bed in the evening and so on. Really interesting description of the german kids and generally life in Germany during WW2. Will look forward to read some other books of the author.
055357342X|5.0|Read the first two books, and loved them! I was not expecting the plot twists that came with the third! I actually had to stop at one point in the story, yelled \\"WHAT THE HELL!!\\" And had to re-read the chapter again to make sure I didn't miss something. This had me staying up WAY past my bedtime, but it was worth it!

B00908DDZM|5.0|It's late in 2012, and everyone is gawking over one album that just came out...Kendrick Lamar.  That was a fantastic effort from the West Coaster, but it seems like this little wonder, The Heist, is getting overshadowed by the good kid from the maad city.<br /><br />Some call Macklemore 'nerd rap', but it's really just good music.  It's slickly produced and unlike a lot of artists out there these days, he actually has things to say in his music besides money, clothes and hoes.  Macklemore seems like he's having a good time when he raps, and it shows on wax.<br /><br />Give this one a spin.  If I'm picking standout tracks, Thrift Store and Same Love would be up there.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I recommend this case to anyone reading this.  The synthetic leather feels soft and almost real.  The color is slightly darker than it looks in the picture, but I was hoping that was the case anyway.  It is put together very well, and holds my Kindle Fire perfectly.  It adds little bulk to the size of the Kindle, so it's still quite easy to carry around in a backpack or purse.  The elastic band that holds it closed is attached well and does its job perfectly.  I do wish there was a way to stand this case up in portrait orientation, but I knew when I bought it that this feature was unavailable.  Still works very well.<br /><br />Update 4/23/2014<br /><br />A year and a half later, and I am still using this Kindle cover. I carry my Kindle with me nearly everywhere I go.  It and this cover get heavy use.  I drop it, I spill things on it, let's just say I am not the most graceful person.  The cover is still in great shape.  No stains, no rips, no stitching coming loose, the elastic band has not stretched or come off.  It is just a great cover for a Kindle and I absolutely recommend it to anyone who is looking.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|If you enjoyed book 1, you will probably also like book 2, but the quality has gone a bit downhill. There is a lot more \\"adult content,\\" and a lot less storyline. I'm not saying it is bad, its not. I rather enjoyed it, but it is not the same caliber as the first book. I grow tired of reading the words, \\"fifty shades of...\\" I am also sure that in real life people don't \\"murmur\\" everything that they say, and I would appreciate it if they did not do it in my literature either. That said, I still read every page start to finish in record time. It kept my interest and I couldn't help but to purchase book 3 as well. Though not a literary classic, this book was worth my time and money.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book after the movie because I wanted a better understanding of what was going on, it is SOOO much better than the movie. Way better descriptions and explanations... The movie was okay but I guess i didn't really get it. I didn't think I would be that into this whole trilogy, but I read all 3 Books back to back they were so good. I reccommend reading it! :) Someday it may very well be banned... Ha read it you will understand what I mean.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was awesome!!! I was not very impressed with the first book, but I read it because I was having withdrawal symptoms from 50 Shades. This book was way better. The love story, the characters and the ending was really good. I can't wait for the third book to come out!!!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Three movies rolled into one. Who wants it? Or should I say who has the stomach for it? Unfortunately, not too many. I am surprised at how many people hate this movie simply because its story line is weak. Yeah...true, there isn't any real story. But then, there doesn't have to be any. This is a motion picture - a product designed to SHOW you an idea (that idea could also be a biography of a real or imaginary character, as is often the case) by running across your eyes a series of pictures. So, why do you need a story? Can't you appreciate the beauty of the flashing pictures, a visual extravaganza thrown at you by a director who simply wants to show-off his talent. Well, if you appreciate movies for what they are, you will like this movie. If not, you would do better buying Jeffery Archer's Twelve Red Herrings and eating it along with your nails. Btw, ever wonder why the Academy never gives away awards for plots and stories?<br /><br />Anyhow...the movie is one of Snyder's most creative yet. He displays astounding camera techniques and pastes his imagination on the film canvas in vivid colors. The movie is about a captured soul and her inner struggle to stabilize herself and accept her fate, since she is not blessed with the strength to fight her enemies. What ensues is a portrayal of her inner struggle to understand her situation, fight however she can, and then surrender to her fate. But it's not what you're being shown, but how it is shown to you. And what better way to experience it than on a Blu-Ray!<br /><br />This package contains the entire movie in Blu-Ray (Extended Cut), DVD (Theatrical Version), and Digital Copy (Theatrical Version). I was able to activate the digital copy even after the printed expiry date. The digital copy will play only on WMP or WMC. The audio-video on BD is astounding, and  is the deserved format for this movie, given its graphical intensity.
B000002ITW|5.0|The \\"Four Way Street\\" of course are the four members of this group, David Crosby, Steven Stills, Graham Nash and Neil Young, all of which were and are tremendous musical talents, with accompanying egos, which sometimes clashed or diverted in different directions, like, say, four streets. Those talents all converged together for this release to make a terrific album.<br /><br />There are few records that so crystallize the hopes, aspirations and ethos of a generation. Surrealistic Pillow is one example, which addressed those ideals of the so-called \\"Summer of 67\\" generation. Sgt. Pepper further exemplified that generation. Four Way Street perfectly addressed the concerns and ideals of the early 70s generation. The so-called \\"Hippies\\" had grown older and had different priorities. For starters, that generation was more political, and so were the songs in this collection. \\"Ohio,\\" and \\"Chicago\\" were very political, the first dealing with the Kent State shootings and the second with the 1968 Democratic Convention. The songs are concerned with substance abuse. That is why Neil Young's song, \\"The Needle and the Damage Done\\" is included. Mostly, the songs dealt with issues in interpersonal relationships and lifestyle, the songs like, \\"Triad,\\" \\"Leeshore,\\" \\"Cowgirl in the Sand,\\"  and \\"Teach Your Children.\\"<br /><br />Its hard to believe that at one time a songwriter could come up with a song about serious issues and still have the song make the charts, but its true. The songs concern serious issues and are still good music. How great is that?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I just really enjoyed the entire trilogy. This book is great. There were parts that were suspenseful, and you just had to see what happened. The ending of it all ways very pleasing!! :) I really loved catnis'' character and she does the right thing for everyone. So great, but is still relatable because she has faults and makes human like errors...

B000MQC9H4|2.0|'Tara Road' was released one year before both 'The Holiday' and Debbie Macomber's 'Trading Christmas.' In all three, the main story lines are too similar (even down to the brother showing up unannounced at the house/condo).<br /><br />While 'The Holiday' is too cute and too predictable, I liked Eli Wallach's (RIP 6/24/2014) character so it made the movie watchable but still forgettable.
0525953728|5.0|Terrific book, very well written. I am not someone that reads alot so it takes some doing to keep me reading. This book hooked me from the very beginning an I could not put it down. I was sad to get to the end but very thankful I had the opportunity to read it. Great story (truthful version) of these amazing men and their commitment to our country.[[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so amazing ... at first i didnt even consider reading it because of all the public hype about it but after giving in and just reading the first chapter to see how it was i couldnt put it down and strait read through it... great book!!!!
0307341550|3.0|Below is my original review if the book, which is still valid; however, today I would give the book 3.5 stars. Ms. Flynn's works, like Scotch whiskey, is somewhat of an acquired taste. Upon reflection, I find the book innovative and out of the box. I was a little harsh on my first rush to judgment.<br /><br />Full disclosure - my \\"reading\\" of this book was from an audio version that I listened to on my mp3 player at the gym.<br /><br />I wont go into the plot as, this has been done by other reviewers. I will just give my reasons for disliking the book.<br /><br />First I have to give the author credit for developing real characters. These were fully developed and kept honest to their inception. The one character that varied from scene to scene was probably intentional.<br /><br />The bad part is that all of the characters were miserable people. The narrator of the book is a mediocre reporter, semi-alcoholic and self loathing individual. Also not a very nice person, but then neither is anyone else in the book. Even the murdered children were not entirely sympathetic. It was impossible for me to find anyone in the book to care about.<br /><br />The narrator suffered great trauma caused by a dysfunctional family and the death of a beloved sister. I get it, but I still did not like her.<br /><br />The mystery itself takes a back seat to the narrator's continued problems, and is not really much of a mystery. Anyone that is surprised at the revelation of the murders, just wasn't paying attention. Again, probably the author's intention.<br /><br />For me the ending was overlong, and was in three parts. The arrest, the aftermath when crucial evidence was finally discovered and the epilog. All of which were true to the flow of the novel, but were unfulfilling to me.
034580404X|1.0|Im giving this one star because of the price for the kindle edition. No I haven't read it but the price alone warrants the one star review.<br />I would like to read this but not for the kindle price. why is it more than the actual paper book that has to go to a printer and be taken to stores and all that? Makes no sense to me at all. If all kindle books were half what the paper books or less were then Id be buying a heck of a lot more. I get quite a few free ones right now because I just hate to pay as much for a kindle book as a actual paper book.  lets face it they have no overhead in selling the kindles.. its set it up one time and thats it. I understand they cant just give them all away but like I said half price is fair to me. but more that the actual books are? explain why? you wont see me buying this book(s)<br />Id also like to know if this is or was originally a fanfic of the twilight series? its what I have heard.
B008Y5OW20|4.0|If you got \\"Armchair Theatre\\" 20 years ago, and you liked \\"September Song,\\" you'll like this. It's an album's worth of the same. I don't know why Jeff Lynne has said he used to hate some of this music, when he's clearly been drawn to it for 20+ years. If you liked \\"Don't Let Go,\\" you'll also like this album, which features another rockabilly remake in the same vein. So it kind of straddles genres, but it's mostly rooted in pre-rock and roll standards. He's even managed to bring some charm to some songs I've ALWAYS disliked (\\"Love is a Many Splendored Piece of Sap\\" and \\"Smile--As Though You Haven't Heard This Song a Zillion and Six Times.\\" Of course the whole affair is filtered through the inimitable Jeff Lynne/ELO \\"sound,\\" so if you don't like THAT, stay away. It runs a bit short, so he certainly could have tossed a few more on here (and I'm SURE he recorded a few more). Be on the lookout for bonus tracks.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|I found the book so far (read about a third of it) to be extemely rich in motivation-spawning statements. And I apply this to my main profession (being a PhD student in marine robotics) primarily: Arnold turns out to be a very disciplined person with a great vision, who exactly knows how to turn this vision into reality.<br /><br />Honestly, after a couple of years in grad school, I sometimes feel my personal vision and ambition to pursue a PhD slipping away from me, but reading this book made me wanting to approach my professional life in a similarly determined way as Arnold does. Really, this guy is my role model now, and many of his statements help me now to stay focused in research, stay concentrated when practicing the trumpet, and be ambitious in natural bodybuilding.<br /><br />Thumbs up! Can't wait to finish the book.
0446580848|5.0|I don't read thrillers for the humor, but wise cracking John Corey had me laughing out loud. In addition to the humor, it was the best John Corey novel yet, and they've all been great.  The character development was interesting, believable, and well done. The plot was well crafted and the  ending was superb  You couldn't find a better book in this genre.
B007SGM084|4.0|loved all three books!loved watching the transformation of a man who didnt know how to trust or love change. was an interesting read.
B008OJ291W|3.0|I know Jeff Lynne has always said he wished the strings on \\"Showdown\\" could have been beefier, and here he's accomplished that. In fact, the tracks that benefit the most are the oldest ones, before E.L.O. had fully mastered (or had the budget for?) the full potential of the studio. Another plus: his voice is in top form; he hasn't lost it at all in that department. Oddly, some songs sound richer and \\"fuller,\\" while some others sound more compressed, particularly individual instruments (cowbells!). So it's very much a trade-off here. The one new track, \\"Point of No Return,\\" is about five years old, and stacked up against the others...it doesn't really. It's solid filler, but it ain't no \\"Sweet Talkin' Woman\\" (which is curiously absent here--guess that one has always been perfect, Jeff?). I don't know if he REALLY did this to \\"right the wrongs\\" he always heard in these songs, or if it's a matter of licensing and control (as it was with Squeeze's recent superfluous re-recorded Greatest Hits--also a note-for-note recreation with nothing gained), but one thing HAS been accomplished: it's gotten people to notice and listen to these songs again, which is always a good thing. Pick your favorite version, but at least acknowledge this man's/band's genius. I've heard he's got an album of original material due next year, and this project (and LongWave) will definitely garner that one more attention when the time comes.
0307895475|5.0|This book has more than you will possibly end up reading. It is almost 1000 pages! It is a definite help and if you are trying to get the most of the the game it is a must buy.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I must say I downloaded this game for my kids to use because they have it for the Xbox and PC and I thought it might come in handy on long car rides, long lines, etc.  I have 3 kids ages 16, 10, and 7-2 boys and a girl- and all 3 are very happy with it and enjoy the 'creative mode' and all the options included.  I do know all 3 were pleasantly surprised by all the options in the game and I think they expected it to be some minimized version of the Xbox and PC editions, though thrilled to find out it was indeed full content.<br /><br />From interviewing the children I believe Minecraft Pocket Edition has exceeded expectations!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Its my favorite movie of.all time with the.all.star.cast playing some of my favorite heros that I wish I.could be thats hot and I cant say that there was one favorite part.through the.movie because all of.it was awesome
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Look, I like Tim Burton movies (for the most part) and I like vampire movies (the vicious kind, not the Twilight kind). However, this movie was awful. It was so slow and so ridiculous that I had to turn it off. The acting and all the CGI were really bad. I found myself not caring much about the movie or the characters. Speaking as a person who has seen 30 days of night three times, that' saying a lot. I finally abandoned the movie after Abe's son was in bed with bite marks. Don't waste your money.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The acting and writing are simply amazing.  I'm a huge fan of British detective and mystery series and this ranks up there with the best of them.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was really good! I took me a few days to read and was pretty easy language. This does get a little descriptive in some areas that I really don't want to know about. Definately not for younger readers probably age 16+
0385535147|2.0|I happened to catch Grisham appearing on the Today Show and thought it might be nice to read one of his books again.  In some respects the story felt like a rerun of The Firm and not that original.  The plot and twists were pretty good, but I still figured out what was going to happen, just didn't figure out every detail.  Some elements did not seem very believable in regards to witness protection.<br /><br />The story took FOREVER to get going and in many ways it seemed like 90% was about the past and how the main character had been falsely convicted by an inept FBI.  The overall theme seemed to be don't trust the government or law enforcement; hasn't this been done a million times?  It was interesting about Rule 35 and how Max manipulates everyone for his freedom from prison.<br /><br />What should have been exciting with the revealing of all the secrets it just wasn't that interesting or satisfying.  Perhaps it would help if there was a likeable character in the story.  The climax was awkward and tried to be intelligently complicated, but ended up feeling incomplete.<br /><br /> What really did it was the conclusion.  I started reading what I thought was the last chapter and then realized it was the author's notes.  The final page of the story was so nondescript that I didn't even realize that it was the end!  So that really left me beyond disappointed and wondering why I spent the money.<br /><br />Sure there some interesting parts of the book.  But overall just not one of John Grisham's best.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read all of the Reacher books in order, since it seemed pretty obvious in the last one that he died it seems that the author just drug out one of his old ones that he didn't publish and put it out there. It wasn't quite as good as any of his others, so I came away with the feeling that it may  actually have been one of the first
B004I744AS|5.0|The opening page is always informative and fun! And the options for the letters are great.  There are so many ways to use this product.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I must admit that that I was a little skeptical about the 3D animation until the movie started to play.  It completely exceeded my expectations, my 3 year old son and 5 year old daughter were glued to the tv from start to finish.  The 3D animation had them reaching out towards the tv during several scenes in an attempt to grab realistic objects being projected towards them. I even had to take a double take at times to make sure the items were just animated.  Great story line and the children can learn several science concepts during the movie. I highly recommend this movie to any with kids.
B009GEA41G|1.0|I cut the cable a few months ago and have been doing well with Hulu.  However, CBS shows remain unavailable, so I bought the first episode of How I Met Your Mother from Amazon Video.  The video was of high quality and it was delivered flawlessly.  I have no complaints about the service itself.  The show, however, passed its expiration date 2 seasons ago and it seems as if the writers & cast have just given up.  For the first few seasons, I really cared about the characters and about what would finally become of Ted.  Now I want to punch Ted in the neck.  They've all become such gross caricatures of the original characters that even Alyson Hannigan has become unattractive.  Do we want to continue living in a world where Alyson Hannigan is unattractive?  I think not.  End our misery, CBS.  Cancel How I Met Your Mother.  You don't even have to finish the story.  Nobody cares anymore.  I hope Ted dies alone.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I am a fan of JK Rowling but this book is dull, uninteresting and frankly boring.When you read you want to learn. The subject matter of the \\"Casual Vacancy\\" and the characters can be found in most of our daily newspapers. Why on earth JKR thought that a death of a parish councillor and the subsequent battle for the vacant seat would be interesting is beyond comprehension. The characters are stereo types of people we all come across during our daily lives.What a shame. I was hoping for fun and laughter, excitement and tension and instead the story was dull and boring. I had difficulty finishing it!

0385535147|3.0|This book was not nearly as good as Rainbow 6.  That book had everything, and this book does not even come close to even The Sum of All Fears.  Tom Clancy is really starting to lose it.  I don't like it when Tom Clancy writes about lawyers because he is not as good at it as he is at his other work.  The Racketeer by Tom Clancy did not have the exciting tactical suspense of his earlier books.  Some lawyer was complaining about something, and had an ethical conflict.  The main character, Malcolm, has people above him after him because he has information.  It was a rather medicore effort.  I'd prefer to have Tom Clancy write about spies and planes instead of the courtroom/legal things.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|Product packages well and arrived 2 days early.  Movie plays well except there were three places on disc that hessitated, like a freeze frame, almost undetectable but there.

B002BI6SMI|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and knew immediately that I was going to own it. Good acting, great gritty dialogue and excellent casting made this exciting to watch and see Liam kick some bad guy butt!<br /><br />The BD quality is great, sound is crisp and visuals are stunnning as you would expect. I waited for this to go on sale and it arrived promptly 2 days later thanks to Amazon Prime.
0316228532|5.0|I think it has been a long time since I have read a book that is as honest and raw as this. She unabashedly shows the lives of all kinds of characters in such a masterful way - people complain that she shows so much negative, but I think she shows the positive just as well. I would even venture to say that I haven't seen a social commentary this well written since Jane Austen.<br />Loved it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|you should really play this game because if you like temple run or brave run you will like this game if you buy this have fun
B004JVXTL8|4.0|This is the first 'Paranormal Activity' movie I've seen and I've just finished watching it for the second time.  At first I just didnt get it.  It was far too choppy and seemed to leave out big chunks of the story.  I watched it a second time to see if it was just me.<br />On the second watching I saw several things I didnt the first time and I now like this movie.  Im a fan of soft, understated horror...Like when things are moving and theres no one there.  you know theres something there but you cant see it.<br />Overall, I really enjoyed the creepiness factor and after watching twice, I now understand the story.  Maybe the demon didn't like them trying to pass the buck.
B00138F080|5.0|I am finding it more and more difficult to find new music and musicians that can produce a good album. This is a great album for a Friday commute home with its upbeat but not in your face tempo and surreal lyrics.

B006VGGAC4|5.0|Arnold goes into more detail this time, and the view is not limited to training (as in The Education of a Bodybuilder) but is insightful into his childhood, young bodybuilding career, immigration, college career, working student life, initial business and self promotion, movie career, marriage and family including extended family and formative and meaningful relationships and friends. The view is pan and a lot more detail could have been elaborated on, but the rhythm of a forward progression defines this man's life. It is a misnomer, in that not all is recalled (he is not vulgar) and we can pick any decision point in his career, expound on it twenty-fold and it would serve as a basis for insight into sound judgement (for the most part) or a well-formed intuition. I almost could not put it down, but I had to, as I lead a busy professional and personal life myself. I could not kill it in one reading like I did all his other books (I did not read the Encyclopedia). It is long, satisfying, and 'not finished'. He is back !!!
B00006FDCD|1.0|This was the dumbest movie ever. It was not scary at all, it didn't even scare a two year old, I wanted to just throw it in the trash. I would send it back but it would cost me more for shipping & handling than it was for the movie so I have to just take this as a lost.
1423140605|5.0|Another great story in the Heroes of Olympus series. I adore Percy Jackson and Annabeth and enjoy anytime I get to spend reading about their adventures. This story was by far one of my favorites so far and I loved getting a better understanding of the characters. To see how all of their lives are intertwined is incredible and you can't help but root for them.<br /><br />Thanks Rick for another amazing book. I can't wait for the next book in the series to see how everything transpires. :)

1451695195|4.0|(I have added an EDIT comment to this review below - please look for EDIT in the review text.)<br /><br />Let me start off this review by giving you a view of my perspective on this subject. I'm a Christian and so I believe in God and Heaven, but I'm kind of on the agnostic side, since I feel that we know much less about God than many people seem to claim. I think that God is, in many ways, still a mystery to us. I have my beliefs, but they seem to be quite different from so many of today's Christians that want to make pronouncements, legislate their beliefs onto society as a whole, and use their religion to attack others. But all Christians believe in an afterlife with God, so I do believe Dr. Alexander could very well have taken a 7 day round trip to Heaven. That belief didn't prevent me from reading this book with a skeptical eye, however.<br /><br />(There are some spoilers here)<br /><br />Proof of Heaven is an interesting read, but I can't say I wasn't disappointed. Let's start with the title. You can't really offer proof and I knew that going in. What he does is look at all the scientific explanations for what he experienced and rules them out (though he doesn't spend a lot of time on this, so it's not like you're reading an academic paper). Perhaps they all can be ruled out, but that's not proof, since there just could be some other explanation that he did not consider or is unaware of that rules out an actual near death experience (NDE).<br /><br />So maybe the title overpromised, but there were other issues, also. He claimed he got a three part message that went like this:<br /><br />1) \\"You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever.\\" Ok, no problem there.<br /><br />2) \\"You have nothing to fear.\\" I'd agree with that for the most part, though some would say you'll burn in Hell if you don't accept Jesus as your savior and that generally makes people fearful. This is kind of a tough one. It's nuanced. Lots of things to think about here.<br /><br />3) \\"There is nothing you can do wrong.\\" What!? Let's look at some extreme examples here: Hitler? Stalin? They didn't do anything wrong? Even your average murder or rapist. That person didn't do something wrong? I think that's going to leave most readers scratching their head. And nowhere in the book is that idea fleshed out. And that's a big one. Perhaps the biggest. So we're left with a pretty amazing statement with no explanation, no supporting statements, nothing, nada, zip. Should I just go out and start robbing banks and living a selfish life because nothing I can do is wrong? To just put this out there with no real explanation or discussion is, to my mind, doing a disservice to the reader and leaving us hanging on a very key point. This is probably my biggest problem with the book.<br /><br />EDIT: In a comment from Dr. Alexander on my review, he says these \\"rules\\" applied in that Heavenly realm. I pointed out to him that maybe that wasn't too clear and he agreed and said he understood why I had interpreted it like did. Read the comments on my review and you will see our conversation. I have chosen to leave the review as I orginally posted it since that is needed to understand the comments. Please read his comments where he addresses some of the points in my review.<br /><br />There are other issues, too. He speaks of a friend of his wife's who is an \\"intuitive\\" and a \\"channel\\" and she contacts coma patients while they are in the coma to help them heal. Sorry, but this is an area where I'm highly skeptical. Supposedly this friend contacted him, but he's kind of short on details. I won't say I completely rule out this type of thing, but it's just way too easy for these types of people to take advantage of the gullible. There's no way to prove anything about what they do and if the person does recover, they can just take credit.<br /><br />He also talks about seeing faces while he was \\"out beyond\\" and later identifying them (he claimed he did not recognize them while having his NDE). My question is did he just merely want them to be the faces of his friends and family and so that's what they became in his mind after his recovery? Similarly, he spoke of a female companion that helped him during his experience. He felt an immense platonic love from this being, but could not identify her. Later he determined this was the sister he did not know from his birth family (he was adopted and met his birth family later in life after one of his biological sisters had died). Again, was this just who he wanted that being to be? Was it just the convenient explanation?<br /><br />Another thing that's not dealt with is the purpose and meaning of our Earthly, bodily life. I was hoping for a little insight there, but found none.<br /><br />Also, he sometimes calls God \\"Om\\". That seemed kind of weird as I was reading the book, given that it's a Hindu thing, but I did find this on Wikipedia: \\"Hindus believe that as creation began, the divine, all-encompassing consciousness took the form of the first and original vibration manifesting as sound 'OM'.\\" Actually, that does fit in pretty well with his discussion of consciousness in the book, so maybe that's not so odd. And I suppose it should remind us that God is the God of all people, not just Christians, Jews, and Muslims.<br /><br />I did like a quote from Descartes that he used. I found it to be highly accurate.<br /><br />Let me end on a positive note and mention the part in the book that appealed to me the most. His first words after waking up (as he recounts it in the book, at least) were \\"thank you\\" because they removed his ventilator tube (it's always good to remember your manners, even after a coma!). The second words he spoke were \\"All is well.\\" He mentions in this part of the book how his sister, Phyllis, took that as him \\"imparting a crucial message from the beyond, that the world is as it should be, that we have nothing to fear.\\" This parallels a story my father (a retired Methodist minister) tells about what he experienced when his beloved Grandmother died. Standing in front of her casket, looking at her body, he heard in his great grief \\"All is well\\" in his mind as clearly as someone had spoken the words in his ear. He felt it was a message from God or his grandmother letting him know that she was still alive and living in a better place, a place of joy and love. He uses this story at funerals to help comfort the grieving.<br /><br />Though I had some issues with the book, its message is still a good one and it's probably going to be an interesting read for most people with an interest in these matters.  I guess we always want more answers, don't we? This book does not provide them, but its message that God is there, God is real, He loves us, and we have a lot to look forward to is an important one.

0316228532|4.0|Thought I'd get my two cents in along with the others. Last week I attended the play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. Along the second intermission I asked myself why I was  paying good money to see people be mean to each other. The same thought occurred toward the end of The Casual Vacancy, although the price was a lot lower. It did seem as if there was a lot of nastiness between the book's characters. But, all in all, that excess only caused me to deduct one star, because the writing is excellent and the characters certainly colorful, if not always endearing. I realized that I had been caught up in the life of Pagford, the English village where the action is centered. I can't say that it is a microcosm for our world, but two things have reminded me lately of the need for us to be nicer to others: Virginia Woolf and Krystal Weedon.

1423165691|5.0|I love this book!  The pencil sketches are gorgeous, and have a \\"life of their own\\", often more so than the images that end up on screen. If you consider yourself an \\"historian\\" and want a detailed analysis of the art in the book, you will be disappointed. If, however, you want a beautiful book of art that is EXACTLY what the publisher describes, then this is for you!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Addictive game and had lot's of fun playing. The most FRUSTRATING part is the level 5 clock. My husband finally helped me figure this one out. I got it to open @ 5:40 but the one thing he pointed out is that on a regular clock with hands, if it's 5:40 the little hand is not directly on the 5, it's about 2/3's of the way between the 5 &amp; 6. As soon as I thought about it that way and adjusted the little hand for the different times accordingly, the clock opened right up. So don't b dumb like me &amp; play thru twice before u realize what ur doing wrong :)  Other than this the game is awesome, the graphics are great and I had no issues playing on my Galaxy Tab 2. Hope this helps some of u out. :~)
B009KHCT94|2.0|I was looking forward to this movie when it was originally released in theaters but the release was so limited and lasted not that long at all that I never got to see it  I knew it was going to be a spoof type sci fi flick but...the story line sucked, the dialogue dragged and while I'll freely admit I enjoyed the lead actresses performance somewhat...if only because of my weakness for blondes..by and large I just got to say this one left a bit to be desired. I don't know...maybe it'll grow on me later

B007Z9QWVK|5.0|This movie had me visually captivated. I saw it months ago, and I STILL see scenes flash in my mind. It was beautifully shot, moving art. A really simple story brought into beautifully sharp focus with magical images. I have it on my Christmas list and it will sit next to Il Postino and Life is Beautiful as movie art. I treasure the memories this movie gives me and I love talking about it to my friends.
0061122416|5.0|October 26, 2012<br />A review of the Alchemist by Paulo Coelho<br /><br />This review is written by Anthony T. Riggio.  After reading the above book, given to me by my youngest sister, as a gift, during a recent visit, I promised her I would read it.  My sister, who suffers from a mental illness, said the book had impacted her and thought it a spiritual work.  Mental illness is certainly a stigma in our society but I have come to see it as a blessing by God to allow my sister to see things in an unvarnished way.  She has lost everything and lives a most simple life in a therapeutic family care environment.  She lives there because neither of her siblings are ill prepared to handle things when the chemical unbalance occurs, which it inevitably happens at the unscheduled moments.<br /><br />Even in her limited world, she has been able to see the spiritual where most of us cannot.  That she spent the full publisher's price infuriated me but then I stopped to think about the genuineness of her generosity and love she has for her older brother, I decided to graciously accept her gift.<br />The Alchemist is a simple story which some might refer to as a fable.  It is however the story of a boy, Santiago, who search for the meaning of a dream which hopes to lead him to a treasure. It is the story of one finding his/her Personal Legend (roughly destiny and/or meaning for life).<br /><br />The book emphasizes the reason for each living in the now as opposed to one's past or future. This is often a difficult task but a profound spiritual experience when fully accomplished because in that now moment we experience ourselves and get a glimpse of God.  This book however is not a religious book because as the author advised religion provides the discipline for the community experience in its devotion to God.<br /><br />I had to look up exactly what an alchemist was, as I was always informed he was a pseudo-chemist who always tried to turn lead into gold, but this is a rather shallow definition and one that will be better defined by reading this exquisite book.<br />The alchemist in this book is more like the \\"Desert Fathers\\" who fled to the desert in search of God and the meaning of life.  It is most interesting how three of the world's largest religions have their roots in the desert.  What is it about the desert and communion it allows with our maker?<br /><br />This book is a delight to read and very quick, though I have found myself reviewing past pages to understand fully the very simple message the author is conveying.  This book can be read in one sitting very easily but I advise against it because it has a lingering flavor you want to savor.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for those that enjoy a compelling simple story and for those caught in the niche of other genres; I recommend it as a book to pull you back to your center.<br /><br />Writing a review for book's that someday will be the tool for future study and analysis is an intimidating undertaking and I hope that I have not misinterpreted or offended the author who will be / is, one of the great authors of our time.<br /><br />This book was given five stars and is available on Amazon Kindle for a most reasonable price.ow definition and one that will be better defined by reading this exquisite book.<br />The alchemist in this book is more like the \\"Desert Fathers\\" who fled to the desert in search of God and the meaning of life.

B0057GYO9K|2.0|Don't bother buying the Remaster! Stick with the original release.<br /><br />The only reason i didn't give this one star is because of all of the bonus material it comes with.<br />I am sick and tired of the loudness war. Louder is not better!! This album when listened to in it's entirety fatigues your ears. Instead of having the dynamic range that Kurt originally intended for all of the songs on the album to have. It just drones on as one constant loud mess and instead of getting lost in the music, you get lost in daydreaming and forget to listen to the music.<br /><br />I just hope they don't ruin In Utero on it's 20th anniversary if they decide to remaster and re-release it. Hopefully they hand that job over to Steve Albini to remaster. I'd be more upset if they ruined In Utero.

0786891416|4.0|since i don't watch the tv show, the book is being valued on its merits alone.  there is a lot to like here.  the prime motivator is the relationship between detective Nikki Heat and her tag along writer, Rook. In this first book he is tagging along to write about the murder squad she leads. he is a big name journalist with a mother who was a Broadway theater grand diva. He is very cute and easy to like. Heat is the stronger personality. She takes her job very seriously and went into this work because of her own mother's murder. The two of them together remind me of Bones and Booth in the BONES tv show.<br /><br />the mystery itself is good.  it about a real estate developer gone bust who is killed by being pushed off his sixth floor apartment to the street below.  there are a lot of suspects and i figured out who was the culprit not too far along.<br /><br />so it is Rook and Heat who set this book apart from the avalanche of detective fiction now available. these are not great mysteries but they do make for nice escapist reading.  I am now reading book two in the series for that escapism factor.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B007ZMAL32|5.0|I've searched for English language books on Charles XII here on Amazon, but have found none that can compensate for what this album does.  Every song basically tells a story from different eras in the history of the Swedish empire, and I have found myself learning more about the subject just by listening to the tracks (but also rockin' out to some great metal)!  Sabaton has shown once again that they really can't fail at making awesome tributes to legendary times in the military history of the world.  Can't wait for more in the future! But buy this album first of course!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite books I have read. The story and book are easy enough to read, which I first read when I was in high school. I have since gone back and read the book another 2 or 3 more times. Each time the book is just as good as the first time I read it. It explores a space faring human race which is at war with an alien race. And it follows the main character's journey, problems, friendships, and enemies as he goes through military academy. As the book progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to put the book down. For people who enjoy syfy human future/space-type books, I highly suggest this one.
B009WJWE7W|5.0|there is an absolutely cracker jack exorcism in this episode.  it is right up there with the scenes from the film THE EXORCIST. in this one there is no head turning all the way around but short of that, there is everything any horror fan could want in a horror tv episode. this does not involve a continuous character as the character is brought in by his parents to the asylum for the first time in this episode and his story ends there. best of all, we get to see Jessica Lange get into it with the subject of the exorcism when she is left alone with him.<br /><br />i did not previously know that electroshock was used to \\"cure\\" lesbians back in the sixties.  this also occurs in this episode.  i checked online to see how true this was.  it is true and apparently some fundamentalist christian groups in the usa still espouse it as part of conversion therapy to turn gays into straights. actually the most shocking part of this is discovering that it is not fiction for the show!<br /><br />lots more going on as well but the above serves as an appetizer if you are considering buying this episode.  go for it!
1597801585|2.0|I read this book for a book club, I even voted for it for the selection - note to self, don't vote again!<br /><br />This book is set in the future, in Malaya(Malaysia I think). Food it modified, people aren't valued, it's similar to now. Imagine that!<br /><br />The government is corrupt.  They take bribes, the kill people.  They spy on each other, the dislike each other, the frame each other.  The government is just crap.<br /><br />Anderson Lake is a company yes man. He's wormed his way into a spring factory and is trying to get his hold on the seed bank. Then he meets Emiko, who is a windup girl. She is not human, she is a lab creation. A toy or a novelty to him. She has feelings for him, he uses her. He uses everyone, but in the end he gets his.<br /><br />This book was long and drawn out over insignificant things. Like the ngaw, I'm pretty sure its a kiwi and yes it was genetically modified too. We didn't need three chapters on it.<br /><br />Emiko is hardly mentioned, she has little pieces here or there and what she does have are brutal parts that make you cringe. And to be honest I'm not even sure what the point of it was.  To show that she obeys?  To show that she is weak?  To show?????  Yeah I'm not sure.

B000TEUCFA|5.0|Stacey Kent was quoted by writer of Liner Notes, Robert G. Kaiser, saying: \\"I wanted to reveal more of myself on this album in a way that I hadn't fully before.\\" He ended his Liner Notes with these words: \\"Did she succeed? I think so. Now you decide.\\"<br /><br />Yes, I guess she succeeded in revealing that she could also record non-standards and French songs as she never done before since most of her albums are standards-oriented in which she excels because she is one of the very best interpreters of The Great American Songbook. I have enjoyed her  albums in my collection and they get a fair share of playtime in my listening adventure.<br /><br />\\"Breakfast On The Morning Tram\\" was recorded in England in 2007 and released on the same year under Blue Note. It is Ms. Kent's first project with the prestigious recording company known for its high-quality jazz albums. It presents Stacey Kent in her most relaxed renditions of a plateful of contemporary songs, a spoonful of standards, and a scoop of French chansons. She is backed by her regular, ever reliable, uber talented bandmates: Jim Tomlinson (sax/flute), John Parricelli (guitar), Graham Harvey (piano), Dave Chamberlain (double bass) and Matt Skelton (drums/percussions). Jim Tomlinson wrote the striking arrangements on the entire tracks and the band's interplay is simply splendid.<br /><br />The repertoire starts off with \\"The Ice Hotel,\\" an original song with lyrics written by Kazuo Ishiguro set to glowing, well-composed music by Jim Tomlinson, a superb saxophonist whose technique has the same quality and finesse with that of Stan Getz.<br /><br />Ray Evans and Jay Livingston's \\"Never Let Me Go\\" is the theme song from the 1956 movie \\"The Scarlet Hour.\\" It was performed by Nat King Cole in that movie. The songwriting pair was also known for their many famous songs most notably \\"Mona Lisa\\" and \\"Dear Heart.\\" She renders it immaculately with utmost respect to the real essence of the song--no frills and extra toppings--just the perfect way the songwriters expected it to be sung. Simple yet full of charms.<br /><br />The French songs are very special treats for my ears. The rhythms of \\"Samba Saravah\\" and \\"Ces Petits Riens\\" are engagingly enchanting. \\"La Saison Des Pluies\\" is very delicately delivered with only a gentle guitar accompaniment by John Parricelli. It is a soothing serenade.<br /><br />Sergio Mendes, Alan and Marilyn Bergman's \\"So Many Stars\\" is the peach of my ear. It is one of the most beautiful renditions ever recorded. Other noteworthy versions of this lovely song in my music collection include that of Natalie Cole ([[ASIN:B0000646GK Ask a Woman Who Knows]] ), Jane Monheit ([[ASIN:B000N0U2UA Surrender]] and [[ASIN:B00005AWDF Come Dream With Me]] ), Sarah Vaughan ([[ASIN:B000G7PNJU Jazz Signatures - Send in the Clowns: Very Best Of]] ), Barbra Streisand ([[ASIN:B0058A11AK What Matters Most - Barbra Streisand Sings The Lyrics of Alan And Marilyn Bergman]]) and of course the original recording of Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66 ([[ASIN:B000002GCB Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66 - Greatest Hits]]).<br /><br />She ends this pleasing presentation with a sempiternal standard made popular by the legendary Louis Armstrong, \\"What A Wonderful World,\\" which highlights John Parricelli's attention-grabbing guitar riffs.<br /><br />I'm a staunch appreciator of Stacey Kent and Jim Tomlinson music and have collected more than a dozen of their remarkable CDs to enjoy forever. I always look forward to their new albums.<br /><br />I graciously recommend this album. You'll enjoy it as much as I do!ust the perfect way the songwriters expected it to be sung.

B009KUANWG|5.0|Finally, we have a James Bond title song that sounds like a James Bond title song. It has been several years since we had a befitting James Bond title song. I was actually amazed by the depth and richness of this song and just surprised just how good Adele's voice is on it. Definitely, James Bond is back.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that Adele's title song is not included on Thomas Newman's SKYFALL soundtrack. Thomas Newman's score to SKYFALL definitely needs it!<br /><br />Adele's SKYFALL title song will undoubtedly earn its place along side the other classic Bond songs that have become part of that cinematic art form through the last 50 years.

140132634X|3.0|How often have you heard yourself say \\" I wish there was more time in the day. I just need more time. Where does the time go?\\"<br /><br />Our days and lives are measured against time - calendars and clocks. But what about the first person to measure time?<br /><br />Albom spins a fable about Dor - the first man to map the passage of the moon and sun, to track the minutes, hours, days and years. And how angry he made God with his measuring. For that,  Dor is imprisoned in a cave for thousands of years. His chance at redemption lies with the fate of two very disparate people. Sarah - a teenager determined to end her time on earth. And Victor - a terminally ill senior who desperately wants to prolong his time.<br /><br />I chose to listen to The Time Keeper. Dan Stevens was the reader. He has a British accent, but is easily understood. He has a very versatile voice, conjuring up three very different voices for the characters. Albom's prose are quite spare and Steven's interpretation of the book really suited. In retrospect, I was glad I chose to listen rather than read. Listening was more like being told a story.<br /><br />The book is quite short and easily read in one sitting. Albom has written a book that is sure to make you stop and re-evaluate the passage of time in your own life. And to appreciate what we have and how precious it is.....
B000MM079U|5.0|William Holden may be the star of the film but Alec Guinness leaves an indelible image as the inimitable British Colonel Nicholson and Sessue Hayakawa as the powerfully weak Colonel Saito. William Holden's character and predicament almost seem secondary to the central plot. The true substance of the story lies in the conflict and irony between Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa and the morality of British soldiers building a bridge for the enemy to the best of their abilities. The bridge is central to the plot and it takes on symbolic meaning as both a monument to British ingenuity and the inept weakness of their Japanese captors.<br /><br />Malcolm Arnold's score is most memorable for his use of Kenneth Alford's \\"Colonel Bogey March.\\" This full is full of indelible sights and sounds. The unique look of the bridge structure over the River Kwai, the \\"Colonel Bogey March\\" and the scene where Alec Guinness falls on the plunger of the detonator box rigged to blow up the bridge have lived with me ever since I saw this film as a kid. That was a longtime ago, a time well remembered that only exists in my memory now. Adapted from Pierre Boulle's novel the screenplay (credited to Boulle) was written by the blacklisted Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, who received their Academy Awards, posthumously, in 1985.

That opinion changed as got more than halfway through and reached the end.  There is no resolution.  It leaves you hanging, and not in a good, suspenseful way.  I feel like it started strong and just went south. It had so much more potential than it actually ended up giving.  This could have been a much stronger novel.  I feel disappointed in this book overall.

B0034G4P94|2.0|Hollywood made many boxing-themed movies, from \\"The Champ\\", \\"Rocky\\", \\"Raging Bull\\" to \\"The Fighter\\", all excellent.  There's only one about Wrestling-\\"The Wrestler\\", also good.  Now comes the Mixed Martial Art/UFC-themed \\"Warrior\\".<br /><br />After 2 hr 20 min rollacoaster ride of Ultimate Melodrama on films in recent years, I have the feeling that this writer/director seems to have cooked up this unbelievably contrived human story first then tag on this MMA/UFC as an afterthought.<br /><br />\\"Spoiler Alert\\"<br /><br />2 estranged brothers, both former highschool wrestling champs, 1 a highschool physics teacher facing imminent house foreclosure and 1 an AWOL from Iraq, a substance abuser, who was so devastated as the sole survivor while his close comrade killed by friendly fire.  Both hate their father whom they blamed for their deceased long suffering mother.  Both decided to enter the MMA/UFC fight in Vegas for the $5 million purse with merely a crash course in training.<br />1 asked his old trainer friend and 1 asked his father(a MMA/UFC trainer?) to get them ready and the 2 brothers ended up facing-off in the octagon(the cage).<br /><br />Anyone who has seen UFC fights on TV will know those fighters are a dedicated bunch who live and breath for their moments in<br />the octagon.  This film's fatal flaw is that there is not a moment that is believable about those 2 brothers ended up as the finalists in<br />the championship fight.  Why would the highschool teacher risk his life and family entering into this extreme sport instead of<br />downsizing his dwelling?  Why would the AWOL brother be not arrested and instead cheered upon by his platoon(where did they<br />come from?) and wanted to win the $5million to be given to his comrade's widow?  For counter balance, the highschool teacher was cheered upon by his students!  Even the reactions of the highschool teacher's wife was confusing.  First, she wouldn't dare to<br />answer her phone about the news of her husband's fight.  Next moment, she's at the ring side cheering him on.  The first hour of<br />the film, the filmmaker used unnecessary cross editing and multi-screen format to enliven the film tempo.  The gym trainer showed<br />up at the father's doorstep was shown twice for no reason whatsoever.<br /><br />The acting of the 3 leading actors was servicable, considering the script and the direction.  Joel Edgerton gave a more heart-felt<br />performance.  Again, the much lauded Tom Hardy did not have much to do other than showing his anger and pain.  As for Nick<br />Nolte who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, he seemed to be under-directed most of the time and looked like he'd down<br />a bottle of scotch in the first secene in the hotel room while in the immediate next shot he seemed to have slept off.<br />Finally for the most important part, the fights, were choreographed and filmed with little excitment.<br /><br />Why would anyone give this film 5 star is beyond me.nd's fight.

It sounded unfocused and had no special qualities to it.  But after maybe 10 listens, it grew on me.  I started to hear the music in my head, and there is a depth to it that I began to understand.<br /><br />I guess I needed to adjust to it, but i've got to say now, that it is really good.  I'm really enjoying this album.<br /><br />I'm glad I took the risk.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|The color is great and the price was reasonable.  My only gripe about this case is if I have my Kindle in landscape view and proped up, my Kindle tends to slide down and I have to move it back. I wished it had groves so that it would stay up.
0385535147|5.0|Reading most of his books there was a familiar slide, as with many authors, in the quality of the stories.  This, for me, has been the trend with Mr. Grisham.<br /><br />But with this book he is back on top.  I found it fast paced and with a great storyline and characters......couldn't put it down.  Now stop reading reviews and go get the book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My son told me about how much fun this game is. Once I loaded it on my Kindle and played it I could not put it down. Before I knew it I was already finished with the first round.  This is a great game.
B0091REZMW|3.0|this game is fun but if you don't want to purchase gems its tricky to play.<br /> very good at telling you what to do but I still don't understand everything.
0307960471|3.0|After enjoying \\"The Snowman\\" I had anticipated liking \\"Phantom\\" at least as much; unfortunately that was not the case.  I found the book to be like being caught in rush hour traffic with someone constantly changing the radio station just as you get in synch with what's playing.  The book was very slow in some parts and then there would be a flurry of engaging action and then a return to the tedium.  Adding to the frustration with the book was that the story shifted forwards and back in time, and the frequent, unannounced changes in whose voice the story was being told.  It just was not possible to get comfortable with the pace of the story.  Finally, there were too many graphic scenes of drug usage as well as dealing for my taste.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was amazing! kept me entertained the entire time!:) if you think this was good try maximum ride! it was great also.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Where the heck is the next book!<br />Leaving my daughter and me hanging for a year!<br />Really?<br />(Great book)<br />Thanks
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A Clash of Kings is a better book then the Game of Thrones, partially because you are familiar with all the characters.  It's a good read with many.. many story lines to keep track of and lots of excitement!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I downloaded this game after I had beaten all the levels of the original angry birds. I was happy to find that I liked this version even better! It's definitely challenging and I love the seasonal themes and scenery. However, Rovio has released 30 new levels called \\"Haunted Hogs\\", and those of us who have the app through Amazon have yet to receive our update. I give the game 5 stars, but I give Amazon 1 star for being slow to update.<br /><br />---------------------<br /><br />I wrote that last review over a year ago, and I am now changing my review from four stars to five stars. Amazon is now up-to-speed on updating all the levels of Angry Birds for Kindle. This includes Angry Birds Rio, Angry Birds Star Wars/Star Wars II, Seasons, etc. I play on my Kindle Fire HDX and the quality of the game is just fantastic.
B004H1V5RU|1.0|This was given to my son as a gift.  He had the original perplexus and was very intrigued by this one.  Unfortunately he hardly got to play with it because it broke soon after he received it.  The plastic dented (with no rough play) and it no longer worked.  I contacted customer service (for the perplexus company not Amazon!) and initially was told they would replace it once I submitted some information (picture, code on the ball, etc).  Well, once I submitted this info, they said they would not replace it. The customer service person was very unhelpful and even gave me silly advice telling me that I should massage the plastic and perhaps that would get out the dent!  Anyway, I thought this was a great gift to give for birthday presents, etc but will no longer buy.  Back to Legos!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I come up with the best ideas and shopping list every night but by morning I am lucky if I remember half of what I needed. no more. I speak my list to my kindle which is by my bed anyway. and tomorrow it is waiting for me on my phone. love it!!!  great for business  and family activity ideas too!
B001QOGYFO|5.0|Greetings.<br />  This film (I think) is much maligned because many elements have been used in other popular films.  I do think they have made a very competent and watchable film, and I was struck by the following:<br />1. very excellent support role elements/acting.<br />2. a real question of where the story was going.<br />3. a wonderfully handled (and beautiful) environment.<br />4. genuine tension and dread.<br />All, IMHO.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|We absolutely love this album! I listen to it as I drive around town. The other day, my child was pouting in the backseat. I put on his two favorite songs (Peponi and Cello Wars) and he cheered right up.<br />The price for the album is very reasonable.<br />Shipping was lightning fast (I think we received it on the day it was released).
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I liked the movie, but I had to wait until the next day to watch it because it kept freezing and starting.  I thought it was my connection, but I was able to watch Netflix with no problems after logging off Amazon.  I will not use this service again.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book. Gideon and Eva are a good couple each with their own secrets. I wanted to keep reading to see what happened next. Am dying because now I have to wait till May for the final book.
B008J34466|5.0|Congratulations to P!nk!!!! This is one of the best CDs of recent times. I like every song in it. I can't stop listening to it over and over. Whatever inspired her to write those lyrics, I hope it keeps inspiring her her to keep writing more. Great Job!!!
B0007MWZEK|4.0|the first one i ordered broke while assembling. i was pretty irritated, BUT i got a replacement and i love the swivel sweeper. it's got good suction and it maneuvers well. i have had one of these before and it lasted a while. it's worth $25 when other sweepers similar to this one are $50!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I absolutely love this series. Season 2 was great and I am loving season 3 on tv now. This is a must have for any fan.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I wasnt sure about this book but once i got into the series I couldn't put it down.  I haven't been able to read but listened to it as an audio book and it was amazing.  Loved it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is the best. I love everything about it, especially the Dictionary feature on my Motorola Driod2. I have no complaints. I love it.

B0098VXE50|3.0|The basic problem with \\"Snow white and the Huntsman\\" is the casting of the title character.  Charlize Theron is terrific and terriclly beautiful as the wicked queen.  Unfortunately not only is K Stew not terrifically beautiful but she is an inadequate actress.  The rest of the cast is outstanding as are the costumes, sets and locations.  It is a beautiful film somewhat marred by the casting of the lead character.  Too bad.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|What a great book. Anastasia is one lucky girl. It was funny, witty, and the writer E.L. James did a fabulous job. I laughed, cried, and found this book not only sexy, but touching as well. The story line was well put togeather and was not the usual cheesy romance novel. It has substance and flair. It was hot and steamy, but had some serious LOL moments. My only complaint is that how will my poor husband ever live up to the Grey standard of romance????
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book is a far cry from the Harry Potter series.  I understand that she was trying to move away from that phase but this book so far is not anything out of the ordinary.  I'm about 25% through it so maybe something unpredicable will happen but so far...ho hum...
0425263916|5.0|loved..it...its a must read..couldn\\"t put the book down, i can\\"t wait for the 3rd book to come out in may 2013
B0086700CM|5.0|it is a very fun game I am so addicted to it! in it you can buy all kinds of power ups
B000I186FW|5.0|This is a terrific adaptation of the Comic series to a movie and a story line. One would think it was developed from a famous novel on the peer level of 1984, Fahrenheit 451, or Lord of the Flies. This movie makes one think past the wonderful story to the mirror being held to the face of the USA today. We are only one election away from creating a government similar to one depicted in this film. Witty lines and a great but horrifying story keeps one entertained from start to finish. It leaves you with hope that humans will make the correct choice in times of need and not be sheep to fear of a make believe superstition and made up holy books.  Remember, Remember the 5th of November.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The first few levels are simple enough for my five year old to play, but the later levels can be a good challenge. I thoroughly enjoyed this app and after completing all the levels, the only down side are there aren't more.
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|Terrific way to improve your presentations, especially when you watch Jobs on YouTube at various times while enjoying the book. But don't expect to become like Jobs by just reading the book. Jobs was like Fred Astaire and Michael Jackson; they knew that mastery came from grueling practice--hours and hours of it. Enjoy, but work hard at it too. Well worth the price.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Just finished this Book. . . I don't know what all of the hype was about on this book. It was almost like a scientific project for this neurologist to write.  The entire last 1/3 of the book was nothing but his index and thanking and acknowledgements to his friends, family and colleages. . . . page after page after page!!!  I would not recommend this book after reading it. . . I am so sorry I was so excited about it.  I am looking for really good books on NDE (near death experiences) and books about heaven.  I read one a few years ago by a Betty Eadie, which was much better than this one \\"Proof of Heaven\\".  It proves that Dr. Alexander can waste more pages in a book with his thank yous and index pages than of actual content of his \\"journey\\". I think the author missed a really good chance to give us all a better insight of details and what the hereafter was like for him.  Too much \\"big bang theory\\" and too little feeling for what lies ahead for us all.  A lot of scientific repetition and nothing for the reader to look forward to after the first half of the book.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|The work was well written.  A bit slow but a full narrative of a society much different from ours.  The book was very much a discussion with our neighbor who lived in the life described by the author.  It is a story that should be read by all that have concerns with a society that puts women into second positions in all things.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It's not as good as the first book. But, I had to read it! I would recommend it! It is a good read.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is an amazing purchase. The music is beautiful. You can tell by listening how much they love what they do. In my opinion it is a wonderful gift for anyone.
B000W07EKW|5.0|the product was as listed and the movies are the bizzel bomb , ya can't beat the monkey , dude!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Still an awsome book. It will cure your crave for another fifty shades of grey. Can't wait for book number three. If you need some spice this is the book to read.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|This is a fine cd and shows another positive step towards greater maturity. A more refined \\"Save Me, San Francisco.\\" So if you like this particular cd you'll also appreciate \\"CA 37\\".<br />  I'm sure the younger folks may pull off of this one a bit, but I don't see why. The musical production is top notch and is a dominating factor in the quality of this cd. The tinge of rap (well lets call it less talk and more musical walk) comes off nicely. I don't much care for rap as is, but this has been done so well it just seems to fit. Again it's only a tinge of rap and certainly could be done with or without and still be quite good.<br />  Essentially the production could be called genius in the fact that a broader scoped audience may appreciate the crossover. However, I don't look at it as a marketing ploy, simply because Train's music is reaching new levels and will sell itself if enough people get a listen.<br /><br />  This is a clean, pure, and polished representation of Train's music. Easily the best they have put out to date.

B007TKT2SK|5.0|ive always had a tough time doing fraction problems,. now that I have gone back to school, I use this to check my work as well as cooking and knitting projects. when used in conjunction with this developer's other calculator apps, it has become indespensable.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I truly love this game. I dropped my first kindel and it was replaced by the insurance I bought. All of my apps and books transferred but the app advancments did not. Had to start from square one. The upgrades that have been made to the game since i last played are great. The glu games are great quality in general. It is hard to advance without buying a few upgrade packages. No worries tho, I'm willing to pay a few bucks for highly entertaining games. Blood and Glory is also a favorite of mine by Glu!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an excellent calculator app. it's easy to use, with no complicated anything.  I use it at the supermarket. large numbers and buttons make it easy to read and to use quickly.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved this book, but I really wish the ending was better.  It was a quick read and I enjoyed it, but again (and my friends who've read it, agree), the ending was not good at all.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After years and years of reading, it takes a lot to really captivate me.  Wool has me hooked.  Awesome writing, attention to detail and a wonderful story.  I can't wait to move on to number 6 and see what's next!  Wool is a classic!
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I guess I am just not a good shot.  Maybe that is the premis of this game or why they are so angry, because I seem to not be able to hit much.  Maybe there is a trick to it, I dunno.
1574214276|4.0|if you have Sandy Steen Bartholomew's and Suzanne McNeill's books you already have most of the material included in this book.  I liked the introduction, which gave an expanded explanation about Zentangle and the blurbs salted throughout the text on why various people tangle, but there is little that's new.

0634089358|5.0|Blues Bass - A Guide to the Essential Styles and Techniques: Hal Leonard Bass...<br /> by Ed Friedland<br /><br />This is a great book for the bassist wanting to move into blues song. This is not a beginner book. There is 2 lines consisting of top staff is written note and below that is bass tab. There's not fingering written, but in the beginning it's pretty easy,but advances nicely. I've played keyboards for 40 years and started trying to play bass over 2 years. I finally have a book & cd that is fun and has songs that I know. I highly recommend this book and other books by Ed Friedland.<br />Thanks, \\"Doc\\"Erwin

B000YABS8E|5.0|The movie is hilarious! I had to get it for my Eng 101 class and thought it was going to be boring, but it's actually very funny and has a ton of biblical allusions! Had to pay near 3X the cost of the movie too get it by the next day so I could watch it in time which was a bummer :p

1439152802|5.0|When Laurel Nicholson is sixteen she witnesses a shocking event during a family birthday party which disturbs not just her comfortable existence, but also her belief in what is right and proper in her world. Fifty years later, Laurel returns to her childhood home to be with her dying mother, and the appearance of a long forgotten photograph unleashes memories of a hidden family secret.<br /><br />What then follows is a cleverly narrated dual time story which explores the ravages of war time London and combines a passionate love story alongside a mystery of epic proportions. The gradual layering of the narrative is skilfully manipulated and because the writing is so good, it is very easy to lose yourself in the story. The characters are all believable and whilst there are some who are not particularly likeable, they all add richness to the story. The dual time element is achieved quite seamlessly, and as the gradual revealing of the secret is exposed there is a real sense of completion. Very cleverly, Kate Morton has taken all the missing pieces of the puzzle links them together to form an unforgettable story of love, desire, deceit and greed.<br /><br />Kate Morton seems to go from strength to strength; I think that The Secret Keeper is my favourite book so far.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This book was recommended by an author friend, and it did not disappoint. Stephen King does a brilliant job combining instruction with examples and some humor thrown in. Telling his own backstory and his struggles helped the reader identify with him. How do you not respect what he has been through? Getting published did not come easy for him, as it rarely does for anyone, and he tells of his struggles, frustrations, along with the joyous triumphs.<br /><br />The first part of of the book was mainly his story about how he grew up, started writing, got published, and little personal bits. The second half was examples in writing such as where his inspiration has come from, how he writes, do's and don'ts, and written examples of edits. As an editor myself, I learned a few things!<br /><br />The very last part was his story about his accident in 1999. His recounting of this horrific event read like a book, very visual and detail oriented, to the best of his memory. It was riveting and emotional.<br /><br />5 Stars to the master, Stephen King!
B0043XUXS4|5.0|This album is the bomb!  I can never get enough Peter Gabriel!  This is a must-buy for any of his fans.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I rated the first one in the series much lower.  Couldn't believe that the characters could fall in love that fast, but I am enjoying the second one much more! If you were so so about Bared to You, still give this one a try.  I am finding I can't put this one down.
B005PK553C|5.0|Great show, always twisting and turning the story right from the start. Wished only the ending wasn't so.. cheery. *shrugs*

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|In 3D or BlueRay or indeed any digital format this movie is lots of \\"edge of your seat\\" fun.  Typically a \\"guys\\" movie but the ladies should enjoy the plot as well.

Ladies, watch it with your man and then you get to choose the next video.  Have fun!

B009IKPOUO|4.0|After attending one of the concerts at the new Barclays Center in Brooklyn, I wanted to see what Barbra's been up to.  Now to be honest, I'm only a casual fan who couldn't tell you anything she's done since teaming up with Donna Summer in the 80s.  With that in mind I must say her voice sounded pretty good to me on the newer recordings, and the lady can still hold a note.  It was nice hearing her perform jazz standards like How Are Things In Glocca Morra and Willow Weep For Me.<br /><br />Being Good Isn't Good Enough is a good way to start things off.  Orchestra sound good and she nailed the song, embellished with her own style, of course.<br /><br />Try To Win A Friend has a definite country styling to it- no surprise since it was written by Larry Gatling.  I was intrigued to learn it had been performed by the Carpenters back in the 70s, but as it was new to me it sounded fine.<br /><br />Lost in Wonderland literally sounds canned, like they just found it lying around somewhere and included it.  Nice to have, I guess, but should've been left for something else- like a deluxe boxed set or something.<br /><br />The medley of How Are Things In Glocca Morra/Heather On The Hill is simply beautiful.  'Nuff said.<br /><br />Mother and Child is fantastic when it overlays her voice singing both parts.  I love stuff like that.<br /><br />Album wraps up with Home- from The Wiz just before Dorothy makes it back.  If you don't remember Stephanie Mills' performance from the play or Diana Ross' from the movie, this'll do for ya.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good listening album.  And I don't say that often.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I had to reload my Kindle to remove it. I think the gold should be a limitless easier to earn.
B009WJX10G|2.0|I must side with the majority of the reviews here. Maybe I've seen a worst episode in the past 7 seasons but none come to mind. The new director and writer put too much effort into what is an apparent goal of keeping the show fresh by tackling the storyline through a different angle, or maybe they just wanted to give the stars of the show most of the week off when making this episode. It is a shame because this season started off with one of the best episodes and perhaps set the bar too high. Keep with what works, and definately don't put less of the stars in the episodes, put more (hint, it is time for Castiel to come back and revive this season).
B009B2GT44|5.0|Best show Ever,they don't hold back anything!The episode about the money \\"wad\\" is hilarious.Not sure what episode number it is but I couldn't stop laughing.
B0064W652A|5.0|The story incorporates many major characters in an interesting way. And Jim Lee's art is just amazing. Definitely one of the best Batman trades.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have enjoyed their performances on Youtube for years- and love having the music blasting from my car speakers. If you must choose between their two albums- pick this one. It has a few of their songs from the previous CD, mixed with their latest hits (y'know- Peponi {such a mighty cover of Coldplay's 'Paradise'} and 'What makes you Beautiful' by One Direction. Happy Listening!
B0057OORGC|5.0|With Eric Clapton having just left the band, John Mayall brought in a young, unknown guitarist, Peter Green, as a replacement.  Deram Records released one album \\"A Hard Road,\\" an EP \\"John Mayall's Bluesbreakers with Paul Butterfield, and five singles from this incarnation of Mayall's band.  In 2003, Universal Records released a 2-CD expanded version of \\"A Hard Road\\" which included the album in its stereo mix, the EP, all the single sides, four outtakes from the album sessions and one track which later appeared on Mayall's \\"Blues From Laurel Canyon\\" LP.  A great package, but lacking one essential element.  In 2008, Universal Records' Decca imprint reissued \\"Bluesbreakers:  John Mayall with Eric Clapton in a 2-CD Deluxe Edition.  This set included the album in both its mono and stereo mixes, supplemented by BBC radio sessions, four single sides, six live tracks, and one outtake from the sessions.  The obvious omission of the \\"A Hard Road\\" set was the mono mix of the LP.  Now, thanks to Bob Irwin and the fine folks at Sundazed Records this essential element has been added to the Mayall catalog.  The mono mixes of the album tracks differ greatly from the stereo version.  In 1966, the year \\"A Hard Road\\" was recorded, artists were much more concerned with and spent much more time compiling the mono mixes as FM radio and its stereo capacity had yet to arrive, and AM radio was strictly a mono vehicle.  Oftentimes, the artists were not even involved in the stereo mixes, leaving that project to the producers and label sound engineers.  The release dates were often far apart, the Eric Clapton Bluesbreakers' LP was released in mono in April 1966 and the stereo version not appearing until November 1969.  Point being the mono mixes were the medium of the day and in the case of these Mayall albums, the band was heavily involved in mixing and preparing the mono versions for release.  The difference between the two mixes is quite apparent in many of the 14 tracks included on \\"A HardRoad,\\" to whit especially the two Peter Green compositions \\"The Same Way\\" and \\"The Supernatural,\\" the latter one of the album's standout recordings.  The difference is also quite apparent on the band's covers of the Freddie King/Sonny Thompson chestnuts \\"The Stumble\\" and \\"Someday After Awhile (You'll Be Sorry).  The mono mixes sound much cleaner and bring to mind the days of cruising around town with the radio cranked, a ritual of the times much missed by this listener.  Removing the cd from its digipack, placing it in the cd player and hitting the \\"play\\" button takes me back in time, 45 years in this case, and I swear I can feel the wind blowing through my long (then) hair, while I sing (at least try to) along with Mayall and my head goes into \\"autosway\\" gear in synch with Green's incredible guitar work.  God bless Bob Irwin and the good folks at Sundazed Records for releasing this Mayall masterpiece in, as Green's composition puts it, its \\"Supernatural\\" format.  If you're a Mayall fan or want to get a sense of where the sound of Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac Chicago Blues Band (later shortened to the much more recognizable moniker \\"Fleetwood Mac\\") arose, this LP/CD release is the place to start.  Absolutely essential for blues fans regardless.  Five stars and then some!

B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app. I was so excited to see it available on the kindle fire. But it runs slow. It sticks and most of the time it has a hard time even opening.  Please fix.
0374214913|3.0|The author is a fabulous writer, and the story was not bad.  I was expecting a more spectacular ending, though.  The conclusion was kind of timid, and may not have been  worth the effort. For those that like a book that combines love of literature and high tech, this book might fit the bill.  For me, however, the reward wasn't really worth the journey.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app works great both wifi local and over the Internet. I love it!  Leave your computers on at home and never leave them.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|When I first started this book i thought \\"oh no, what did I just waste 10 bucks on?\\" but I decided to keep reading and I'm glad I did. The overall thesis of the book is that Charlie, not really anti or shy just socially inexperienced, is writing a series of letters to an unknown about his high school experience. Although to whom he is writing is never revealed, it is clear that he may have a \\"six-degree\\" connection because he is purposeful in not disclosing too much information about himself or his location.<br /><br />The story is well organized but I thought the language was a little too formal, especially for a 15 year old boy. In the beginning it felt like I was reading the thoughts of an 8yr old but as the story progressed the better the writing got. Overall it was a good book but I wont classify it as being profound-Charlie is a stereotypical teen, he smokes, gets excited about girls, driving,he experiments with drugs and develops a sense of sexuality. He's trying to find his place in the world not really \\"special\\". Although, it was odd that a 15 year old boy would pickup on so many details; may that's why he was \\"special\\". He's not a savant that's for sure.<br /><br />The title doesn't really go either. I didn't see any benefit from his perspective or my own that made being a wallflower a perk.It was a good read but the at the end we are not given clear insight to what his Aunt Helen really did and why it was only an issue at the end of the book. We are not given any clarity on what his relationship with his Aunt Helen was really like. Honestly, I'm confused even after reading the ending 3 times. Give it a try and decide for your self. I am giving this review 3 stars.<br /><br />**oh yeah, this is listed as a youth fiction but I think the book is way too mature for anyone under 17; that's my opinion.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|This is a seminal SF movie -- the first one to have starships, to talk about faster than light travel, and one of those movies that everyone reacted to for 50 (yes 50!) years.  Some of it looks a little cheesy now (but then look at Star Trek TOS) and anyone under about 30 will probably need to ask parents or grandparents why Ann Francis's costumes and behavior were just this side of scandalous.  But it stands up reasonably well, with a literate script stolen, er, drawn from Shakespeare's Tempest.  Worth watching.
B008OJ291W|4.0|This has most of ELO's most popular and is a wonderful introduction to the band and the extremely talented Jeff Lynne.<br /><br />The newly done tracks are interesting but I didn't think they were different enough to justify purchasing this CD if you already have them from previous releases.<br /><br />\\"Point of No Return\\" is terrific.  If you are a fan save your money, download it and skip the rest of this release.<br /><br />If you enjoy this then purchase \\"Eldorado\\".  It's beautifully written and recorded and I believe it is the best ELO release ever.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was hard to put down once started.  I loved the insight into the planning and training of this elite group.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This was a really good read, the characters were interesting and well developed.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that it kind of seemed like, in the teensiest bit towards the end, \\"A Christmas Carol\\", but in a much more interesting setting.
B0099G3I96|3.0|I thought that ROCK STEADY was so rockin' and couldn't be topped.  I was right.  There are a couple songs reminiscent of ROCK STEADY, but, certainly not as rockin' fun, nor worthy of TRAGIC KINGDOM or even earlier stuff.  This was the worst of RETURN TO SATURN mixed with just new bad mojo.  A couple songs will be on their next Greatest Hits, but overall this album is a disappointment.
B009NQCK7I|5.0|I'm biased....the show is one of my favourite ones I've ever watched. Everything about it is great. Stana's great...Nathan's great...the cast is great....the premise is great. This episode was no exception. Start to finish..loads of fun and heart. Now that the fans have CASKETT...it will get better and better!! At the price you pay for the eps...you can buy it along as the season goes and still splurge on the boxset when it comes out. Buy it...then watch it over and over again...<br /><br />WATCH CASTLE ON ABC MONDAYS @ 9pm Central TIME!! Do it...you know you want to!
1401929281|5.0|Just read it.  Theta Healing is not selling anything but common sense.  If you can (on any level) accept that there is something bigger than yourself. That is, consider the possibility that we are all connected to \\"the creator\\" (whatever you conceive that to b) than you have to ability to make choices that will move your life in the direction you manifest.  Simple.
B003I55BIA|4.0|It wasn't hard to guess what was going t happen nc this book. We all knew that they would fall in love. Though it managed to make me smile and take me away into a life that wasn't my own, which is the point of reading a book. The word choice was kind of corny and expected though.
B000001DYY|5.0|Great collection of songs. Most favorite:goodnight song. followed close by about 4 or 5 others. If you like them together, this one ought to be one you'd like also.

B002BI6SMI|4.0|I very much enjoyed this movie but i am one who saw Taken2 first.  Taken 2 is just a tad better so i had to give this 4 stars and 2 5stars.
B005DD7JL2|1.0|Wasn't very entertaining. I thought there could be pretty good fighting scene, but they're lame. Main character cannot act. All the stuff looks fake. Oh well, I should have skipped this movie.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Storyline seems kind of long and drawn out. Was really hanging on every word in the beginning but once you get past the initial shock value with regards to the sex and kinky stuff felt like I was reading the same stuff over and over again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|By the end of book two I was totally consumed by Ana and Christian's relationship and need for each other.  This book is more than erotica.  It's a true love story, and what woman doesn't LOVE a LOVE story?  I finished this book in 3 days and immediately bought book 3 as it leaves you immediately wanting to continue the story!  I will say that I often caught my self skipping over the redundant details in some paragraphs.  It really should've been edited better, but the story itself is addicting if you can ignore the overuse of some details (Ana blushing, her goddess talk, etc.).  You just have to ignore the lack of editing and remember the fact that it is a FICTION novel!  People keep criticizing that he is ONLY 27 and a billionaire, that she is only 22, etc. but it is FICTION.  It's a must-read in my opinion!  :)
B007MU85D0|5.0|I loved every single song on this album. I RARELY buy entire albums but this was brilliant. Of Monsters and Men is such a talented band! You won't be disappointed if you buy this.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Amazing book loved it good storyline that flows well... makes you want to keep on reading it non stop! Thanks
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Really like this game. Doesn't take alot of talent or effort so it's great to unwind with at the end of a long long day. Be warned...you can really lose track of time while playing this game!
B00992CF6W|3.0|I tried minecraft once. My friend has it, but I don't know if I should spend seven dollars on something I'm not sure I like that much. I know a lot of people are crazy about minecraft but I don't think it sounds that great. When I tried it, it got a bit annoying with the controls and such. Can someone tell me if the controls are as bad as some people say? Do u think I should get it, or not
B009JEMF0Q|4.0|I was afraid that Ellie Goulding's second outing might be overproduced and lack the intimacy and striking song-craft of her debut. While \\"Halycon\\" is a bit \\"hyper-produced\\", Goulding's voice and the strength of the songwriting are suitable for level of production used here. This is a nearly-brilliant pop album by one the most beautiful voices to emerge in this decade.
B008J34466|4.0|Excellent!!!  I'm lovin it!!  It's my first time so am feeling so good about my purchase! Can't wait for the next one!!
B007V2UGPE|1.0|Once you get far in the game and really enjoy it sends you back to the beginning. I am really mad and have no intentions of playing again
1401322786|4.0|Just finished this one. It took me a while to get into this one but about half way thru I couldn't put it down
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Amazing movie. Tied all other characters movies in perfectly. Would def recomend renting or buying this movie. Def worth it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its really fun get it lol I like it so u should XD runs fast to and I like details
B0042K4ZZK|1.0|We just watched the pilot and quit about halfway through that. The trick-young-pretty-boys/girls-into-being-assassins premise is stupid, plus the idea of a 90-pound girl twisting/breaking the neck of a 200-pound man is on a likelihood scale of pigs not only flying but doing so backwards. I don't deny there are tough, battle-ready women out there, but why is Hollywood so intent on pretending they're equal to bigger, burlier men? I've read other reviews that this show doesn't get watched much; maybe it's because the suspension of disbelief factor is too heavy on the disbelief. (By the way, for the record, this was K. Jordan, not R. Jordan, who wrote this comment.)
B001RIY4WE|1.0|Not listed on the product page is the requirement for the blu-ray player to have internet connection. I have my router upstairs and my blu-ray player only allows wired connection, so when I tried to play this disc the first thing it does before going to any menus is it tells me it cannot access internet. When I hit cancel, it fades to black and stays there- it even hijacks my player so I can't do anything at all with the remote. I didn't buy this for the junk games and crappy special features and I'm angry to forces me to look at them first. Total junk edition.
B004EPYSN2|5.0|I have previously read this book and loved it.  So much so that I purchased a copy to have on my Kindle so I can read it again and again.
1401233791|5.0|I THROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS BATMAN GRAPHIC NOVEL. I THOUGHT BANE WAS VERY CLEVER IN THE WAY HE DEALT WITH BATMAN. ONE OF THE BEST GRAPHIC NOVELS I'VE READ IN AWHILE.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok guys 3 words, APP IS AWESOME! I have had so much fun on it. I also play the Pc version of minecraft. I was thinking that you guys could add some of the same stuff that the Pc version has. Like levers, red stone, different skins, buckets, pistons, etc. If you guys read this, plz make me happy and other Pc and pe players around the world happy to. ;)
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Beside that, annoying repetitions, everything happens so quickly, control freaks with sick desires, insecure heroine willing to put-up with control freak and be his sex toy, oh wait now he loves her, and there is another man that's obsessed with her, oh and somebody wants him. and then there is a baby, and the whole thing is a rip-off from twilight. And the ending, priceless.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|These Headphones work great. Only problem I have with it is a weird clicking sound pops up for no reason every once in awhile. Besides that its a great product.
B004RKXNDU|2.0|Not what I expected at all. The writing style is hard to follow, the story itself appears to be very compelling but I really got tired of trying to work out what the author was trying to put across, there were just so many names, after half I just gave up.
B003K16P3M|4.0|It's a captivating story with likeable main characters. It's a little slow at times but interesting enough to keep you going until the action starts.
B007SGM084|2.0|But is wasn't. There was an interesting issues brought up in the series, but the story itself, the main characters, those books just didn't do it for me. And the language, most annoying use or profanity.
1423140605|5.0|OMG!!!!! This book was amazing!!!!! i couldnt get enough of it. and the ending is soooo sweet!! tragegic, yes, but sweet. in a ways. percy's all like \\"we'll never b apart again\\" n annabeth is all like \\"as long as we're together\\" man, but i cant believe they actually fell FELL into Tartarus :'(. n nico's rite. percy IS the most powerful demigod, n with annabeth @ his side, they'll make it through Tartarus n find the doors of death. man, i love love love&lt;3 these books!!!! cant wait till the next one. cant believe its sooooo far away though. i mean, c'mon rick!!!! fall 2013!?!?!?!?!!! ur killing me here!!!! but then again, i wanna give u as much time needed so u can make this book even more awsomer.(i kno that not a real word, but i just made it one. lol) but add a little more Percy Perspective chapters. i wasnt really feeling a lot love from percy's thought span throughout the whole book, but wat u had was REALLY GOOD though. its just that im a DIE HARD PERCY FAN. TEAMPERCY all the way. lol;), well thats all i have to say so far. o actually not really.....one more thing, leo needs a girl. n not one thats already taken or weirdly in love with his great-grandfather. an actual, very pretty, girl thats all his and would appreciate his good looks and humor. i would volunteer, but unfortuantly, im not a fictional book character. *sigh* ok, now THAT'S all i havve to say so far. ill probably reread this book like 5 million times before The House of Hades comes out. lol:). anyways.......good job rick. ur like in my top list of favorite authors. (2nd actually, sorry but Diana Wynne Jones will always be top for me, but dont worry, ur up there. lol) im really looking forward to the next book.
B009GEPPYC|5.0|Loved the music and the story line. Tom Cruise did an fantastic job singing Paradise City and Pour Some Sugar On Me! I was very surprised. Not a big fan of Russell Brand but thought he was hilarious. I really enjoyed the commentary at the end by REO Speedwagon and Def Leppard.Definitely worth watching if you love 80's rock and roll.
B005J2V74C|3.0|For $0.99 its not bad but I wouldn't pay more then that.<br /><br />The movie steals from other's such as the Blair Witch.<br />The movie is predictable and more laugh worthy then jump from your seat.
B0011U8NZ2|3.0|not bad, but not great- perfect for doors fanatics, but not a polished performance- i think the studio albums are better and imo there are better live recordings
B008BGNMZU|3.0|Although long a Fourplay fan and while musicianship is superb, this album just doesn't have the memorable melodic content of previous albums. I found it disappointing. Their last one, Let's Touch the Sky, was so much more pure Fourplay. This one leaves me cold.
B007UK83S4|2.0|OK, we get it that Pete has always been difficult, and we always forgive him, because he's a genius. His airs, affections, tantrums, loopy philosophies, even his murky misadventures into porn (and the criminal charges from which he has been cleared and does explain away) when considered in the context of his unassailable brilliance, his creative and intellectual bravery can all easily be dismissed as the chaff of a highly creative mind.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />He is going too far if he is asking his audience to look at these current meanderings as doing for autobiography what \\"Tommy\\" did for music. Maybe it's because he is trying to be intimate with a large group of people, and intimacy - on any level - is clearly not his forte. Sorry, but his literary pretensions have always seemed to be just that, and we wish he would stick to incendiary rock and roll and even grand operatic statements to express himself.<br /><br />Keith Richards and to a lesser extent Eric Clapton have written amazingly engaging autobiographies, and it's understandable that this has encouraged every other bored rocker looking to supplement their bank accounts to do the same. But buyer beware (and at such a hefty price tag, buyer wait until \\"Who I am\\" comes down in price)... it's an OK read by an intelligent man who lived thorough interesting times, but if you're expecting the sort of sparks we've come to associate with Pete Townsend, you'll likely be disappointed.<br /><br />Put another way, if you're expecting Keith Richards and get a modern day Thomas de Quincey, you've been warned...
B003WUYRGI|2.0|This is good for looking up words like for example zebra I didn't know what that meant so I looked it up and it says it is an animal
B009F879HK|5.0|I only bought one copy just to add it to my collection. I do play my records, but on a Pro-Ject turntable and both sides of this 45 sounded awesome. Also, what makes this product great is that not does the mono mix sound awesome, the record itself is of high quality, and the outer sleeve is sturdy although i always put my 45s in sleeves with plastic lining. But this is a must buy for any Beatles fan and is highly recommended.
B0045HAF22|1.0|I watched season 1 and season 2 with such excitement and then the finale of season 2 happened.  It totally and completely killed the series for me.  I was already starting to get irritated that the series went off on a tangent and forgot about the FRZ or whatever it's called.  I tried to like it and then the real Olivia got stuck in the alternate universe.  I cannot watch this anymore.  Things were going fairly well.  Watching this series is way too much work -.-
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This was the last Harry Potter I needed to complete my collection and have them all! I absolutely love all the movies and this one is no exception. Great suspense and just a great series overall!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a nice clean puzzle, just challenging enough to be engaging. i like the minimalist, simple design and primary colors.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Loved it!!! Better than the first and I loved that one 2! My 14 year old is hooked. Playes the whole album on his guitar :)
B004SOR4H6|1.0|the app it self just fails .... the updates don't help. please don't waste your time. unless you just have time to waste
B007QPFGJW|4.0|another fascinating crime novel with the Harry Hole character and his  friends and  enemies; takes you to a dark place in the human psyche and the struggles of the characters to accept their demons.  Have read all of his novels and definitely be waiting to see what tortuous personalities will come next.
B008XG1X18|1.0|This app is such a waste of time. If you want an app like instagram, this is not the one.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this primarily while traveling I enjoy it quite a bit msny of the common bugs seem to be resolved. I would recommend it highly.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I don't follow modern music very much; I'm a 60's flower girl; so I'm still stuck on that good old rock'n roll from my time...But I love this group; it's peppy, the music is great, very good lyrics, I enjoy it very much! Would highly recommend!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The story grabbed me from the first page and I couldn't put the book down. Jack Reacher is a great character and I highly recommend all of Lee Childs' books!
076790592X|4.0|This book was a great book. I really enjoyed reading it. I believe that this book taught amazing life lessons. One that stood out to me was how Morrie said How you should cherish the moments you have with the ones you love most and making a difference in other peoples life. I believe Morrie changed Mitch's life in a huge way. Mitch started to realize life was not about work and not having fun, it is about Love and making a difference in the world and also living everyday like it was your last. This book really connected to me. It showed me that I do want to live everyday like it was my last with absolutely no regrets while doing so. It also showed me even if life does not go the way you plan it to it does not give you an excuse to be grouchy and fell sorry for yourself, but it gives you a reason to make a difference. I believe that is was Morrie did, he made a difference. Not to just Mitch, but to everyone around him.
1451629184|5.0|I donated this book after i read it. It's almost like reading a horror story. I hope this man rots in jail and hell for ruining this poor girls life and think she is a strong and amazing person for overcoming this.

B001DCZ4IW|4.0|Just a sweet movie. Love the dysfunction that is treated as normal throughout the movie.  Great dialog and an innocence you don't find in movies these days.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|Super excited to get it and when I opened it there was a huge/deep scratch across the screen making my phone look like it had a huge crack in it. Don't know if it is \\"water proof \\" now
B005S9EJ46|3.0|Cinematograpy was excellent, but I found the plot a bit thin, and the acting, whilst of high quality, seemed almost \\"workman-like\\". Perhaps I was expecting too much, but I usually get more enjoyment from British productions.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use this app all the time. It tells me my device's battery health, and even its temperature. I have no problems with it!
B002TZS5GU|4.0|This Outbreak movie falls somewhere between \\"The Walking Dead\\" series & the Ford Brothers' \\"The Dead,\\" only without the zombies. If you liked the slow pace  of \\"The Dead\\" & hated all the quirky BS in \\"Zombieland,\\" this is a good movie for you. I can't really see \\"Zombieland\\" fans enjoying this though.<br /><br />You've got the moderately douchey jock who's as serious as he he is carefree, his irresponsible but not unlikable girlfriend, his emotionally driven younger brother, & the gal pal who manipulates men into letting them think they're calling the shots by directing them & making them do all the work, yet is not particularly dislikable.<br /><br />It's interesting to note that Christopher Meloni of \\"Law & Order SVU\\" is in a good chunk of this movie, because there is another Outbreak movie called \\"Warning Sign\\" staring Sam Waterson of the original \\"Law & Order.<br /><br />Like The Walking Dead, it's a survival movie that reflects on the cold selfish indifference & distrusting nature of mankind against eachother when the s**t hits the fan.<br /><br />Ultimately I felt the movie was too short, but I can say that it paints a more realistic picture of what would go down in a real nationwide crisis. I didn't even have to try to suspend my disbelief.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It was great in the begining, but then got boring after a while but overall, a good game! If you are thinking about getting this game GET IT!!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the first two books more than this one. Its not bad by any means, just not my favorite. It may have something to do with the fact that the main character, Katniss, becomes almost completely unlikable by the third book.
B00322PK2G|4.0|I purchased a Swatch because I have a 28 year old one that still works.  The battery doesn't stay in the back which is the only reason why I am (finally) replacing it. I will only use it occasionally when my tag heuer is getting services - it's a fun, cheap, reliable alternative. My only complaint is that the band is really shiny.  I thought it would be more matte rubbery plastic like the old ones.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app has been very helpful to keep track of how strong or weak my battery is.  I would highly recommend its use.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|It brings back old memories from the original Rayman. Very cute and enjoyable game. Highly recommend to any Rayman fan out there.  :D
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this is a fun game. I like games that are like this. This one is different because it has a story to it.
0525953728|5.0|Having spend 21 years Active Duty in the U. S. NAVY, and another 17 working for the Navy, I really enjoyed reading \\"NO EASY DAY\\".  It is a good book to see how some of our Seals operate and go on missions.
B003WUYP56|4.0|I taught university physics for 36 years and I found this book to be a refreshing analysis of both the history of breakthroughs in physics and the confusion of recent years.  The discussion of the reverberations of successful unification theories was especially enlightening.  In a discipline that right now is rife with tons of speculation, it is not often one finds a practitioner who is willing to acknowledge troubles in the camp.
B00783NWB6|3.0|I saw this movie in a Theater in 3D because I was told the movie was shot in 3D. This was an ok movie with average 3D effects. I saw Avatar in 3D and ths is no Avatar. In Avatar, you felt part on the workd. Here the3D effects seemed forced. The 3D Blu-ray rate the same. A buy for those who need to complete their Underworld collection. I would still purchase the 3D movie because it is rated farely high on a 3D delivery scale
0817439390|4.0|I think Bryan Peterson does a great job here! I took up photography for a hobby a while ago but still got a lot to learn. Bryan makes it the more fun because he knows how to explain and illustrate what he teaches. Everytime I'm immediately challenged to grab my camera and get to work! He is just as driven and enthusiastic as my teacher and that makes every difficult assignment a challence. So if your looking for a real good book on photography, try this and search for Bryan Peterson.

B0084I9QIW|5.0|This DVD of Michael Jackson's BAD tour in London is awesome!  I wish Michael Jackson completed his Dangerous Tour as well.  It sucks because after the BAD tour, Michael Jackson never toured the United States of America.<br /><br />His HIStory tour only had one stop on U.S. soil and that was in Honolulu, Hawaii, which was sold at as well.<br /><br />Even though Michael Jackson is an American, he abandoned the United States of America after 1993.  Guess it makes sense<br />because the media continuosly criticized Michael Jackson.<br /><br />I wonder what it would be like if Michael Jackson never used propofol and completed his This Is It concerts in London.<br /><br />Would the United States of America ever accept Michael Jackson back as a pop singer if he were alive today?
B008EKON56|5.0|Works perfectly, as described. Difference in audio quality is noticeable (I knew what to expect, since I've used direct line out before).<br />Hopefully FiiO will figure out a way to make something similar for new apple lightning connection.
B009FAQ9JW|5.0|one of under rated western classics by Marlon Brando. Great performance with amazing screen play that has been brought to life by amazing actors. A movie ahead of its time in terms of story line.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app. Couldn't pin from the website on my kindle fire before this app came along. It's so easy to use and fun!
B004I744AS|4.0|I haven't needed to use the actual dictionary yet, but I love the daily articles and games it provides. The word match is superfun as is the hangman game. I did not expect to play games with a dictionary app, but as it turns out, I enjoy it. It's also nice to have the sound of the pronunciation.
B0091REZMW|4.0|can get very redundant finding the same items time and time over. however it can get addicting to see what happens next.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really liked the authors way of sudden changes in the story. The closed environment feels dull in the beginning, but as the story proceeds the \\"Silo\\" becomes a living thing.
B009G3T01M|5.0|This is a great album. There isn't a single song I skip over when I listen to it, and you can tell the growth and development that Macklemore & Ryan Lewis have had since the last music they created. Buy it. Only downside is I didn't know that this was the clean version of the album, do yourself a favor, make sure you buy the explicit one. Lyrically, the \\"swears\\" that are censored are usually very important, sounds strange without them in some places.

B005L193RO|5.0|the heading of my review, says it all. Its simply written, smart, funny and explains the concept well with tons of examples. Reallt good read.
B00127RAJY|5.0|There have been plenty of great reviews of this DVD so I won't repeat what they've said. I agree with all of them.  I've owned this DVD for the last 5 years and it's always been my go to DVD and I've never gotten tired of it! I'm 24 and I just got out of college. I've always struggled with my weight but I've never been in better shape then when I've continued using any DVD Jillian makes. She's an inspiration and I owe her for SO MANY pounds I've lost over the years. I've tried so many DVDs including the classic Tae Bo that was basically the original infomercial DVD sold on TV. THIS one is better than any other I've tried and it's easy to go back to.
B008B37C8Q|1.0|This review is about all the new reissues, not just this one. It would be great if Amazon would provide essential info about the source of the music used for these CD reissues. Had I kown, I wouldn't of bothered. You don't find out until they have arrived. Some CDs still use the crappy reduxes from the late '80s, some don't.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|People take this book way too serious, some of them are happy, some of them dissapointed, some of them avoid it because it's too popular and so on. I'll be short, it's perfect easy-to-read chick-lit book. You can read it fast, it's entertaining, interesting, with some spicy details and it's actually hard to stop reading it once it sucks you in. I recommend it to everyone.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! The mystery and storyline are solid and don't get lost in volumes of meaningless rhetoric, as in some of the last Scarpetta novels. It was nice to see all the regulars return to the original characters that made this such a popular series. I'm glad Cornwell shortened the book to under 500 pages, making it more concise and a real page turner. The endearing animal stories are back, along with the amusing way that Kay deals with obnoxious and difficult people. The ending leaves it open for maybe another new character to enter the series, we'll see! I can't wait for the next book. Patricia's got my vote again, good job PC!
B0080CL0HM|5.0|I first read the book and found it interesting, but the character of Georges Duroy was completely unsympathetic. However, the movie is another matter. While the character of Georges is clawing for some sort of success and has a lust for money, Robert Pattinson plays this man with such vulnerability that it gives us reason to like him and even root for him. We see the moments when he is hurt and shamed and can literally watch as his heart hardens and he becomes utterly self-seeking. It is a lovely \\"period\\" piece and all three of the women are so good and the attraction they have for Georges seems so natural and real. Kristen Scott-Thomas is the oldest and yet plays the smitten wife of his boss so well...she seems like a school girl with a crush. Its a wonderfully visual movie. I think Robert Pattinson will prove to be a world-class actor.
0547569653|5.0|I must say that I enjoyed every page and every chapter of this book.  Scott Jurek has been one of my \\"running heroes\\" for quite some time now, (I first became aware of his exploits via Runner's World) so I was quite thrilled when his book was finally published.<br /><br />Being an ex distance runner myself, I found this book to be extremely inspirational.  I say \\"ex\\" because due to medical conditions and simple old age I am unable to run like I did for over 35 years.  This does not matter all that much though as I would not have missed the journey for the world.  Even for someone like me though the book inspired other aspects of my life.  It is one of those books that causes you to want to go out and do \\"stuff,\\" stuff that you may not have been interested in when you were 20 or 30 or what every, but still, if you adjust for our physical condition is still doable, fun and exciting.<br /><br />Now I could never in a million years go the rout of Scott when it comes to diet. I can agree with him all I want, but I simply do not have the will power or, lets face it, the desire to go that route.  I can well see where many could and should take this advice and at the very least, give it a try.<br /><br />The book is well written and Scott's quirky sense of humor and thoughtful insight shines through on every page.  I could most certainly relate to what he was saying.  That being said though, I do not feel you have to be a runner or ex-runner to enjoy this work and to get quite a lot out of it.  It is a good read and an inspirational read.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Okay, I admit it. I am an action movie junkie. And I read all of the action hero comic books growing up. So, I have eagerly awaited each new installment (movie) of my favorite heroes. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America. Marvel has done a \\"marvelous\\" job of putting together a series of movies that culminate in The Avengers.<br /><br />I love the characters in this movie and the dialogue is pithy and funny and entertaining. Plus some of the action takes you by surprise (wait until you see the confrontation between the Hulk and Loki). I saw this in the movie theater with my son and determined right then and there that this movie would be added to my collection at home. And the Blu-ray version is fantastic. The soundtrack and the sound effects are nothing short of amazing and the quality is pristine. It is a real treat to watch and will bring our family great enjoyment again and again.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|Chicago has to be one of the best  musicals of all time, great cast, great music and stunningly produced numbers. Who can ever forget Cell Block Tango or Mr Cellophane?
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|August's character gives voice to all the feelings of insecurity, isolation, and fear most experience at one time or another, both real and imagined, with a unique and heart-felt quality that only comes around once in a rare while.  I saw the world through his eyes very clearly.  Then I was treated to a related view through the eyes of his sister, a devoted girl entering high school.  This compeling novel introduced me to the main charachters that touch August as he navigates through his first year of middle school. I started reading the novel aloud and found myself smiling often, even laughing.  I also found myself sobbing hard over exquisitely written real-life experiences many of us have shared.  The amazing voices make the book a compelling read for young and old alike. We are artfully reminded of what it means to be young and why it's important to treat ourselves and each other well. I would not review a book more highly.

0374275637|5.0|There are already many, many 5 star reviews that have clearly expanded on why this book is well worth both owning and reading.<br /><br />I found Kahnemann's commentary on his life of research, the insights he has gained, and the directions of cognitive science exceptional. I appreciated the personal quality of his writing. Instead of putting a purely theoretical and empirical tome together, Kahnemann allows us a little insight into his life and thinking.<br /><br />I loved reading about the applied quality of the research, particularly as it influences policy. While some have commented that they have concerns over misapplied research in the public policy sphere, I was impressed to see the way this research could inform decisions that make life generally better for others.<br /><br />The research is of the highest quality, which probably goes without saying. The implications are significant. The book is well thought out and flows at a reasonable pace (although it does drag down from time to time - just remember you're reading for learning and not entertainment). I found the idea of the 'water-cooler' conversation a little superfluous and unrealistic so I started ignoring that... but beyond that, I loved the book.<br /><br />Justin Coulson PhD
1469984202|5.0|Un-putdownable! Move over David Weber! What a story!! I thoroughly enjoyed every word. Like nothing I have ever read. I discovered what was going on when the characters did. This book resonated with me long after the last page.<br />Do yourself a favor and buy this one right away. Destined to be a classic.<br /><br />I was searching for a new series after Honor Harrington. This is very fertile ground. I want to know more and more about these people.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Recently I purchased a Sony XBR HX 950 to upgrade from an older Sony model and also have the opportunity to view 3d movies.  To date, I have purchased Kung Fu Panda 2 3d Blu Ray and Avengers 3d Blu Ray while eagerly anticipating this Avatar release.<br /><br />Both of the original purchases are great 3D blu ray movies and I recommend them to anyone that wants 3d enjoyment (plus I am a huge fan of the Avengers movie).  After owning Avatar Blu Ray 3d for over a week now, there is little question to this statement \\"Avatar 3D Blu Ray is the benchmark for 3D home Entertainment.\\"<br /><br />My wife is not a tech person and with 3d, you can be exposed to ghosting or cross talk which may turn someone off prior to engaging in a 3d movie.  Last night she watched Avatar with me and has an entirely new perspective on what 3d can offer.  Avatar is such a brilliant movie experience that you virtually have none of the challenges that plague movies that were not shot originally in 3d.  Additionally, Avatar shows promise of what 3d can be for future releases that come out.<br /><br />I have to say, I actually believe this blu ray experience on my new Sony rivals the Movie Theater experience if not beats it.  The 3d depth and detail is one breathtaking experience after the next.  I am actually surprised at how impressed I am at the visuals.<br /><br />If you own a 3d TV, the answer is simple, treat yourself to the ultimate 3d movie experience to date and hope that the Hobbit and future 3d blu ray movies can rival this masterpiece that James Cameron has given us.<br /><br />This review is all about the 3d.  There are countless scenes in this movie that remind you why you spent a little extra for the prospect of watching 3d.  If you don't yet own this, I hope this review has given you some context to make your decision.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is one great movie! The acting, the music score, everything! Be ready with the tissue box though, because trust me you are going to cry! My dad is a dog lover and he really loved this movie. It's very sad but it's also a happy movie at the same time. What a great story. Great Buy! Highly recommend it!
B005NFW19K|5.0|I am absolutely obsessed with this show!  I love Elena, Damon, Stefan, and all the other main characters!  All I have to say is Elena's a very lucky girl!
1400067820|5.0|I begin for readers who have not read anything else by this author, especially those who are familiar with his ideas only second-hand. His second book, [[ASIN:1400067936 Fooled by Randomness]], is by far the easiest introduction to his ideas. It is relatively short and illustrates his ideas in dramatic and amusing stories. For people with technical backgrounds, the first book, [[ASIN:0471152803 Dynamic Hedging]], makes the points in a much more restricted domain (managing risk of financial options) which allows more precision. [[ASIN:1400069971 The Bed of Procrustes]] is striking and insightful, but as it is a series of loosely connected aphorisms, the reader has to sort out the links for herself.<br /><br />Taleb's third and most commercially successful book, [[ASIN:081297381X The Black Swan]], and this one (which may become his most successful), lay out his ideas in more breadth and depth. The three in the first paragraph are relatively non-controversial. They are critical mainly of people who are safe to ridicule, those who are blind to the uncertainty in the universe in fields that are ruled by randomness, such as finance. The Black Swan and Antifragile attack--in the most intemperate language--people, ideas and professions accustomed to reflexive worship. The attacks are vigorous and directed at the core beliefs that underpin large areas of modern life.<br /><br />These latter two books are more difficult to read. They are long, and their complex ideas are interwoven in overlapping essays rather than dissected in textbook order. Every page contains outrageous contentions that few readers will accept in full. You can skate on the surface taking the books as pure iconoclasm, amusing and provocative but ultimately specious. They're actually valuable taken in that spirit, but they are far deeper and more important than that.<br /><br />The Black Swan concentrates on the case that long-term outcomes are dominated by events that are individually highly improbable, and also that are inherently unpredictable--Black Swans. Many people have interpreted \\"inherently unpredictable\\" as \\"hard to predict,\\" and set to work on techniques to predict Black Swans. That misses the point. The events only have their impact BECAUSE they were not predicted. If someone invented a Black Swan prediction system, all it would do is make different highly improbable events into the Black Swans.<br /><br />A common criticism of The Black Swan is that it tears opposing ideas down without giving any positive advice about what to do. That is, if long-term outcomes are dominated by Black Swans, why do anything at all except wait around and hope the unpredictable, improbable events are good for you rather than bad? In fact, there is quite a bit of sound advice in The Black Swan (see the short review by David Aldous at [...] for the best and most balanced summary of the claims) but the advice is about avoiding predictable disaster caused by unpredictable events, and keeping yourself open to positive outcomes from improbable events.<br /><br />Antifragile complements The Black Swan by celebrating systems that gain from disorder, trading away short-term predictability and micro-rationality for long-term success exploiting macro-unpredictability. It's a bold attitude, amply supported by argument and example from many fields. If anything, it is more outrageous and iconoclastic than The Black Swan. It is Taleb's most important book to date, as it closes the circle. On one level, the universe (at least as perceived by humans) is ruled by disorder, but on another level, the crucial elements are those that gain from disorder as eventually these are fitter for survival than any element, however strong, that requires order.<br /><br />If you have read any of Taleb's other books, I suggest Antifragile is the best next one to read. If you have not read any, I suggest starting with either Fooled by Randomness or if you have a technical background, Dynamic Hedging; then moving on to Antifragile. However, it is certainly possible to read Antifragile with no prior preparation. Eventually, everyone should read all of his books (or all of his thinking, most of which is available free at his website). But if you have to pick only one, Antifragile is the best choice.ossible to read Antifragile with no prior preparation. Eventually, everyone should read all of his books (or all of his thinking, most of which is available free at his website). But if you have to pick only one, Antifragile is the best choice.

1442474440|5.0|This fantastic edition has a velvety-to-the-touch black hardcover with Wyeth's art emblazoned on the front. The illustrations inside have been given new life with vibrant color.

B003EYVXTG|5.0|\\"Winter's bone\\" is one of the best films I saw in a long, long time. I watched it with eyes wide open without ever taking the shortest break and I was speechless for a long moment after the final credits rolled...<br /><br />Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) is 17 years old. She lives in a impoverished area in Ozark mountains. Since her father disappeared and her mother mentally collapsed she was left in sole charge of the family house and her two much younger siblings. Even before her parents became unavailable the family was very poor (as almost all other people living in the area) but now Ree makes her family survive from day to day by all sorts of expedients, more and more desperate. And then suddenly she must face a new, completely unexpected and devastating blow... What follows is an incredible, heartbreaking and nervewrecking fight this seemingly defenseless and helpless girl will wage against all odds, with very little help, to save her family... And as Ulysses had to step down to Hades to find his way to Ithaca, so she will have also at one moment to go into the deep, cold darkness... I am not saying anything more.<br /><br />I was and still am in total awe of Jennifer Lawrence's performance in this film. It is not an accident that this was her big break - and once you watched this film you will realise that she simply HAD TO be chosen to play Katniss Everdeen in \\"Hunger Games\\" - because in this film she already played her, even if character's name was different.<br /><br />I also simply loved the fact, that this film, although definitely not \\"Hollywoodian\\" and very, very grim in its presentation of America's poorest people, contained also lots of very valuable lessons about how to win against even the most unfavorable odds. Ree is not only totally fearless and resolved - she is also clever and always thinks things over before acting. She is not a great speaker but the few words she says are always carefully weighted and measured, to make certain they hit right where she wants them to hit. She never panicks. She always has a plan. And she always, always keeps her calm and preserves her dignity - even when lying in the dirt, coughing blood...<br /><br />This uncorrupted dignity is actually the main source of her power. Unlike many of her teenage friends Ree didn't marry at a young age and she didn't get pregnant either, as so many young girls in the poorest neighborhoods. She NEVER touches to drugs - she even refuses to smoke a joint... She is also probably the only character on the screen who never drinks even one drop of alcohol. Totally focused on the survival of her family she seems to be completely celibate - although she is certainly not indifferent to men, as it is possible to see in scenes when she meets her very, very scary uncle Teardrop... Very ambivalent looks and conversations (and only looks and conversations - nothing more) between Ree and her uncle make some moments of this film more unsettling than most thrillers I saw...<br /><br />The vision of this poor mountainous society living almost totally outside the laws of the rest of the country is another treasure of this film. It is an extraordinary thing, that Ree, who is an extraordinary noble character, shows openly contempt to the policemen - because in this strange world even if you are not a criminal yourself, you simply never talk to cops. Ever.<br /><br />Some \\"progressist\\" critics called this film \\"feminist\\", but I didn't see in this film any feminism at all. It is the story about human strength and dignity facing a world as cold and cruel as possible, with as much resolve and courage as one can imagine. Nothing more - but also nothing less.<br /><br />In conclusion, I will repeat just once more - I LOVED this film and I am going to watch it again soon, because this is one of the best movies to be made in the last years. Enjoy!She never panicks. She always has a plan. And she always, always keeps her calm and preserves her dignity - even when lying in the dirt, coughing blood...

B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book is very boring and while i was looking for a word it takes me forever to find the word in it.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|This is a very, very good SF film, one of the best made in this beginning of XXI century - I watched it with pleasure and I was pretty impressed by it.<br /><br />This is very much a one man show, about a man named Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) who supervises alone a robotic helium3 mine on the hidden face of the Moon. He signed the contract for three years and as the time passes by he starts to wonder if he didn't overestimated his capacity to endure loneliness and isolation. He misses greatly his family as he receives only occasional messages from his wife left on Earth (the communications suck most of the time, no matter how hard he tries to fix them). In fact his only &#34;companion&#34; is central computer GERTY, a very powerful AI communicating with voice of Kevin Spacey. Still, as the end of his contract approaches, Sam soldiers on. Then, one day, something unexpected happens...<br /><br />&#34;Moon&#34; is a slow paced, low drama film - but it is never boring, even for one minute. Sam Bell is a brave fellow with whom it is easy to identify and sympphatize and GERTY is a pretty rare thing in SF films - a really nice and even compassionate artificial intelligence... Their conversations and other interactions are a pleasure to watch. The scenario is strong and quite moving. The ending, always the most difficult point, is also pretty good, although I personally would change the last 15 seconds of the film, to make it even better and even more powerful - but it is a purely personal point of view. Special effects are definitely NOT the center of this film, but they are very honest.<br /><br />So all in all this is, let say it again, a very, very good SF film, in which tension is masterfully created by a smart scenario and smoothly delivered with deceiving calm by the compassionate voice of a very nice computer... I am very happy that I bought and watched this DVD and it is definitely a keeper! See &#34;Moon&#34;, listen to GERTY and enjoy!
B000AJIF4E|1.0|ive had a pair of these headphones for more that 10 years, one pair to rule them all. after dragging them all over the world on tours and in studios and airplanes the headphone jack finally got a short in it, so instead of fixing it i decided to reward myself with a new pair. well, the new edition sucks. the ear pads fall off all the time and its a pain to put them back on just for them to come off again. mine fell off the last time in the airport as i ran for a flight, never to be seen again. sony said they will sell me a new set for 40 bucks, gee thanks sony. its obvious when looking at the old pair and the new pair that the craftsmanship has changed for the worse. yet the price remains the same. good old out-sourcing. i wrote sony about it and even talked to customer service, ha, what a joke, you may as well look up mr.sony in your local phonebook and call him up. i suggest a pair of bose. the have the same great sound and they have great customer service just in case something goes wrong.<br />its all rather sad, a legendary product falls victim to corporate corner cutting. shame on you sony.

I finally gave in last night, though, and figured I could just turn it off if it got to be too much. I ended up watching the whole thing because it was nowhere near as bad as I had it built up in my head to be and was relieved it contains less torture than I was expecting. It's still definitely brutal and cringe worthy to be sure, though. As many other reviewers have noted, the build up is slow, presumably to get you to care about the doomed characters before all the slicing and dicing breaks loose. While that did work for me, I would have preferred a little less of it and a little more focus on the people who were paying big bucks to butcher people in the first place. Other than being obviously soulless, I would have been interested in finding out back stories of more of the sadists and what would compel them to do such horrific acts. But then again, not knowing does make it more disturbing. Although I always feel great glee when those tormented get revenge and it was satisfying to see certain people get their comeuppance here, if Roth had made a complete descent into this nightmare world and not gratified viewers with vengeance, this might have been an unforgettable shocker.
B009B50QOU|1.0|If you like a barrage of cuss words for no reason you will love this, otherwise I wouldn't bother. There are a few songs that I actually started to enjoy but I certainly couldn't play them anywhere in public because sooner or later blatant foul language comes out...and really for no reason. Seriously, foul language usually doesn't bother me but this is too much and it doesn't really seem necessary. Its almost like they threw the language in as an afterthought. Why? I had been looking forward to the next two CD's but after hearing this one, I doubt I will waste my time...or money.

0756405890|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but I have to for this one.  What a great book!<br />I read this book based on a word of mouth recommendation from a guy at a book store who saw that I was purchasing another book, and recommended this one(\\"if you like _______, you should really take a look at The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss\\").  I filed the recommendation away in the back of my mind, not expecting to remember it, let alone read the book.  About a year later, I had some time to kill on vacation and gave it a shot.  I was expecting a cookie-cutter sci-fi/fantasy book.  You know the kind that I am talking about - books that are entertaining reads, but seem to follow a familiar, well-worn pattern, but aren't exceptional and as a result don't stick with you long after you finish reading them.  Upon starting the book, I saw the same old tropes being set up, but somehow, the more I got into the book, the better it got.  Instead of falling into the same old storylines, it seems new.  The author has set up an interesting world, but what I really like about the story is that he captures the emotional impact of the events of the story on Kvothe.  I also like that, similar to George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series (AKA Game of Thrones), I often caught myself being surprised by plot twists, after being sure that I knew what was going to happen.  This is my favorite book in the last several years, and is definitely worth your time.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Long after most of his contemporaries creative juices have dried up, Bob Dylan just keeps turning out brilliant album after brilliant album.  Tempest shows two sides of Dylan's songwriting chops.  The first half of the album is a collection of excellent dirty road house blues which, while not ground breaking by any stretch of the imagination, stand along side the finest of blues classics. The second half of Tempest shows Dylan's penchant for penning great story songs.  Two tracks on the latter half of this record clock in at no less than twelve minutes, unfolding tragic tales of both love and loss which never become boring or distracting in spite of their long running time.<br /><br />There are a select few artists who continue to remain commercially viable year in and year out no matter what the current trends are or what happens to be popular on the radio at the time.  Bob Dylan heads up that exclusive fraternity.  God willing and the creek don't rise, we'll continue to get to enjoy new music from Bob Dylan for many years to come, in spite of the fact that he isn't getting any younger.

B009WJWMNI|5.0|I don't like much in the way of network TV. It seems like all the best shows are coming out of the premium cable channels' studios.<br /><br />This show is the exception that proves the rule. It's not quite a superhero show; the main character doesn't really have any superpowers, just awesome skills. It's not sci-fi, at least not yet, but it's not fantasy either. It is action-packed and promises lots of intrigue and plot twists, sort of like Lost except our hero is Found.<br /><br />One thing it definitely is not is Smallville. I liked Smallville a lot; I watched almost the whole series, even when the writing started falling off. But that show was not as dark as this one; Clark Kent was an angelic alien while Arrow's Oliver Queen is neither alien nor angelic. He even kills when necessary.<br /><br />This show had me from the pilot. There was this scene in which Oliver is in plastic handcuffs and about to die, but he manages to Break Free and totally kicks multiple butts. It is an awesome scene; I especially like the way it's hinted that Oliver's best friend secretly was awake and watching the whole thing although Oliver thinks his friend's been knocked out. Does Oliver's friend know his secret? The scene is such a tease.<br /><br />I hope the show's quality continues at this level because if it does we could have a multi-season winner here. I can't wait for next week's episode (I'm writing this three shows into the series) and have to admit that I stumbled onto this page because I was checking out the Complete Series 1 DVD--which unfortunately isn't available yet but I REALLY want to watch the entire season RIGHT NOW!!! (No I don't want to pre-order; I want it NOW NOW NOW!)

B008FSCNTK|5.0|Diana Krall: Glad Rag Doll<br />By Will Layman 15 October 2012<br /><br />Success is to be devoutly hoped for in life. And if you are a jazz musician, achieving Diana Krall-level success is like winning the lottery or striking gold - a rare coming together of spectacular sales and not a little critical acclaim.<br /><br />But that kind of success in art is going to be a prison more often than not. It certainly was for Krall.<br /><br />Diana Krall is very good at singing jazz standards in a smoky and sexy voice, accompanied by her own deft piano and often a swinging trio or a lush orchestration. Her audience seemed to want more of that, please. She made six such records (as well as a crisp live record of the same standard material) in the decade following her 1993 debut. Then she tried something different: 2004's The Girl in the Other Room, a collection of rock-era songs and original material that sounded only a little like jazz and nothing like her prior work. The market spoke loud and clear. She went back to jazz standards and bossa nova after that for three more discs.<br /><br />Except that Diana Krall turns out to be an interesting and searching artist. Her smoothest material was always rich in rhythm and hip phrasing, and her piano work was confident and melodic - way more than merely competent. And it turns out that she was not content to keep doing the same thing over and over again.<br /><br />Glad Rag Doll is a riveting leap forward and backward at once. It leaps forward because it allows Krall to sound much more contemporary, embracing and owning for the first time a directness of expression that includes distorted rock guitars and thumping drums. But it leaps backward as well to songs from the 1920s and 1930s that include vaudeville, blues, and roots material, as well as jazz era pop songs. Glad Rag Doll is old and new, but mainly it's fresh and bracing. It does not reinvent Diana Krall - she sounds utterly like herself here. But it makes you realize that her talent is broader than you previously realized.<br /><br />Glad Rag Doll was produced by T-Bone Burnett, and it has his distinctive mark, including boasting his house rhythm section of guitarist Mark Ribot, bassist Dennis Crouch, and drummer Jay Bellarose. The groove here swings plenty when it wants to, but it also whumps and rocks and even crackles. This is not \\"Diana Krall Rocks!\\" In fact, most of these songs are decades older than Krall's usual repertoire. But Burnett embraces the roughness and directness of that older music, and so the effect is that of Krall's diamond-like voice being affixed to a craggy setting. And it makes her shine that much brighter.<br /><br />The Betty James rockabilly tune, \\"I'm a Little Mixed Up\\", is a perfect bit of joy. The guitars are distorted and rootsy - twangy and rocking at once - with the rhythm section playing a slap-happy backbeat that inspires Krall to play barrelhouse piano that is as lean and clutch as any Allen Toussaint performance. But there is the smooth alto of Krall's voice, bending the melody and the lyrics too, and sounding great: close to the elemental emotion of the tune.<br /><br />Or check out Doc Pomus's \\"Lonely Avenue\\", which has got to be the grittiest recording in Krall's canon, with a guitar squall that storms behind her pouty voice as if Neil Young had been mischievously let loose in a Manhattan nightclub. Burnett brilliantly mixes Ribot's banjo with feedback and thunderous left hand crashes on piano - with the whole mix getting positively atonal in a collective improvisation that takes place after the second vocal section. It is ripping good fun, but haunting too, with the leader's vocal getting at legit blues feeling.<br /><br />Other tunes branch away from Krall's traditional strengths by treading on folk or \\"Americana\\" territory. \\"Let It Rain\\" is a quiet and simple song featuring acoustic guitars atop a simple rhythm section - plainly sung with no harmony or extra dressing. \\"Prairie Lullaby\\" isa keening waltz that coaxes from Krall a charming and elegant piano solo that has little to do with \\"jazz\\" and is a triumph of avoiding technique. \\"Here Lies Love\\" starts as just piano and vocal, slightly inviting a lounge vibe, but then the rhythm section kicks in with directness. Even though the song's harmonies carry a trace of Tin Pan Alley, the arrangement drips with joy in a slow, back porch style - the kind of music that might be described as \\"pre-rock\\".<br /><br />There is another strain of sound on \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" that will be more familiar for Krall fans - snappy jazz tunes, most certainly, yet ones that clearly come from an earlier era. \\"I Used to Love You But It's All Over Now\\" has a grooving swing driven by acoustic guitar at first, then a loose rhythm section that supports this maximum-relaxation vocal. \\"We Just Can't Say Goodbye\\" chugs along with pre-bop elegance that sets up Krall's vocal tone about perfectly. \\"There Ain't No Sweet Man\\" has a rocking snap to it, but the melody is all jazz. And the title track is a sad ballad that finds Krall accompanied only with guitar, giving her a huge space in which to bend her voice around blue notes.<br /><br />Maybe the best thing on the recording, however, is a more contemporary tune, Julie Miller's \\"Wide River to Cross\\", which is an aching country-folk song that couldn't be more wistful or sad. Here, Krall's husband Elvis Costello makes one of several appearances, in this case providing the slightly strained high harmony that makes the song. This is simply four minutes of bliss, with Krall's piano finding a perfect place in the Burnett arrangement.<br /><br />The only thing here that seems not to work is the final tune, a self-conscious closer (\\"When the Curtain Comes Down\\", natch) that has Costello shouting like a carnival barker. It sounds like the tune farthest from any traditionally black idiom, and it breaks the spell of intimacy and sensuality so carefully built by the rest of the album. My recommendation: just skip this last tune and let \\"Wide River\\" linger in your ear.<br /><br />Let's hope that, having crawled out on this creative and more risky branch, Diana Krall stays out at the edges of her own comfort zone. Glad Rag Doll sounds like a near-ideal blend of jazz chanteuse and roots rock, or tried-and-true and a fresh breeze. What's old is new again, and in this case Diana Krall finds something new in older music - a rejuvenation earned by looking backward in years but forward in daring.<br /><br />Will Layman is a writer, teacher and musician living in the Washington, DC area.

B007MDB6L0|3.0|We bought the regular DVD, not the blueray or combo pack.  There is no Pixie Hollow Games bonus adventure included even though it is advertised as an included bonus feature. The bonus features on the basic DVD are a couple of music videos, that's it.  Buyer beware.  This is misleading.  I would've paid the extra $6 for the 2 disk DVD.
B00689J512|4.0|I did not like this album at first. I had to listen to it a few times to start liking it, but now I love it. It's not her best album, in my opinion. But it has a lot of hit-worthy songs. I felt like a better job could've been choosing singles with this album, as well as the time the songs were released.<br /><br />But any way, here are my top-5 songs<br /><br />1. WE FOUND LOVE - My second favorite Rihanna single (after \\"What's My Name\\"). A great Calvin Harrison production, her 11th #1 hit, and her biggest single to date.<br /><br />2. ROC ME OUT - I really wish this was released. Stargate creates magic for Rihanna, and this is a prime example. This is a rock-infused R&B club banger. Nothing better.<br /><br />3. COCKINESS (I LOVE IT) - I love the beat to this and I love how fast and rhythmic the vocals are (especially in the bridge).<br /><br />4. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN - Another great dance track (courtesy of Dr. Luke and Calvin Harris) that became a huge hit this past summer.<br /><br />5. DRUNK ON LOVE - This samples \\"Intro\\" by the XX. The sample is actually the best thing about the song, but regardless, a good song.<br /><br />Other good songs: TALK THAT TALK, WATCH N' LEARN and DO YA THANG.
B008NR8YTQ|5.0|With Gary on guitar and his band it is a great set of covers of Jimi Hendrix songs. Gary is also joined by Mitch and Billy Cox on couple of songs and also great live.  I was lucky to have seen Jimi in 1967 and 1970 here in Seattle but I never got to see Gary live, but this is super cool and I'm hoping everyone listens to this and enjoys the unreal cover work by the band.
B002UXRH10|5.0|This is by far her most cohesive album.. It's not really a \\"singles\\" album like \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" or \\"Loud\\", but it was a big leap artistically which is not surprising considering the event that preceded this album.<br /><br />My top-5 favorite songs:<br /><br />1. RUDE BOY - The biggest single off of this album and her 6th #1 hit. I'm not surprised. This was meant for the radio, and I had this on repeat in 2010. Grade A quality.<br /><br />2. HARD - The second single. I love the gritty beat and the lyrics. Her attitude is also great.<br /><br />3. STUPID IN LOVE - This is another song that I think could have been a great single. The melody and production are very lush and I like the lyrics.<br /><br />4. RUSSIAN ROULETTE - I don't think people gave this as much of a chance as they should have. This is a very powerful song and the vocals are some of her best.<br /><br />5. TE AMO - I'll never know why this was not a single in North America instead of the less radio-friendly ROCKSTAR 101 (even though I like that song too). This could have been huge. Stargate can do no wrong, as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Other good songs: \\"Firebomb\\" and \\"Wait Your Turn\\".

B0018S6YO4|5.0|Billboard Magazine called this album \\"her now greatest-hits opus\\". Which at the time, it pretty much was, considering all the hits that spun off this from album.<br /><br />I'm not usually a fan of re-releases but because I didn't own the regular version of this album, I didn't feel cheated.<br /><br />My top-5 favorite songs:<br /><br />1. DISTURBIA - I love the funky beat of this and the thriller-movie-esque lyrics.  This was one of the three new songs added to this addition and her 4th #1 hit.<br /><br />2. DON'T STOP THE MUSIC - I didn't realize Stargate even did dance tracks until I heard this, and I was impressed. This opened the door for a lot of the other dance tracks they produced for her as well as other artists.<br /><br />3. UMBRELLA (feat. Jay-Z) - This was huge phenomenon when it first came out and I can see why. This song was always great. I love the chorus.<br /><br />4. TAKE A BOW - The first single added to this re-release and her 3rd #1 hit. It's reminiscent of Beyonce's \\"Irreplaceable\\" with its subject matter and the Stargate production. This is Rihanna's best ballad in my opinion.<br /><br />5. BREAKIN' DISHES - This isat the top of my list of songs that should have been singles. I heard this actually was supposed to be the last single after \\"Rehab\\", but was cancelled due to the Chris Brown incident. Either way, this is such a great song, and I love her attitude on it.<br /><br />Other good songs: REHAB, SELL ME CANDY and SAY IT.

B005CMSDLE|4.0|Hanna is a great revenge thriller that boasts some great fighting scenes and terrific cinematography. The supporting cast, including Bana and Blanchett, are great here but the film is really driven by Ronan. She convincingly portrays a naive girl that truly doesn't anything about the world except for what her father taught her, and pulls of some great stunts. She owns this part and I'm excited to see the path her career takes as she's given more roles.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really loved this book. Couldn't put it down. It is a fantastic sequel to the first book Bared to You. I am on pins and needles waiting for the third book. I highly recommend this series.
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|So glad tv is coming back to the horror genre in a big way<br />Too many reality shows, doctor shows and crime dramas can get boring pretty quickly<br />Looking forward to all the scary stuff going forward
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|This HBO Boardwalk Empire Season One and Season Two kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was gong to happen next. I enjoyed getting to know each of the characters in Season One. I understand now what prohibition involved.<br /><br />Season Two did not end as I expected it to. I was definitely surprised. No wonder the twenties were referred to as the \\"Roaring Twenties\\". I will keep watching to see what is next.<br /><br />JAC
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I like these series of books...if you didn't get enough of Fifty Shades of Grey, these books will keep you going.  The charaters were more indepth.  The only problem is having to wait for the 3rd book to come out in December.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|could play all day love it one of my favs get it and see for yourself you will love it too
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|This is an engaging mystery/romance novel!  The author weaves things into the book that make you feel that you're watching an Episode of Castle and the characters are all there.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|Our daughter loved opening this at Christmas and 1 year later it is still her favorite - it goes everywhere with her, now the 20 month old is feeding her baby doll, putting it to bed, loving and rocking it to sleep.  Great size for a young girl.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Anyone interested in Apoligetics will find this helpful in knowing what Christians other than Catholics are reading. Thank you for this app!
B001HBYHFA|4.0|Plenty of action, acting was excellent as always.  But I thought the movie fell short of the series,  Disappointing, I ordered this DVD and the sound had better be hq or it will go back.  The sound streaming was poorest I have ever encountered.  This is not encoded HD.  I don't think whoever did the encoding had a clue what they were doing, it's that poor.  Loved the series, but didn't think this was a noteworthy end.
B0090NNQX6|4.0|Pop!  The cd as a whole is pretty good.  There are some songs that do not seem that are Mika's but from a teenage pop group.  I think he lost some of his magic when compared with his 2 previous albums.  Still enjoyable though.
0385344228|4.0|I found this book to be well written and very interesting.  I enjoyed reading it, but several members of the book club that I belong to stated that they are \\"tired of dysfunctional family books\\".<br /><br />I found the ending quite surprising, and , as I said I thought the book was well written and I enjoyed it.  I would definitely read another title by the same author.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I read the percy jackson series as they came out years ago. I've read all of Rick Riodan's books and I really enjoy them although I'm older (20). They're just fun stories of these people and I like how he integrates greek/roman mythology into the story lines like he does. I've learned a lot from reading these and I jumped right into the next one after it. I was glad to see percy again and see the other camp.
0761169431|5.0|Gave this as a gift and she loves it. Anyone who loves Star Wars should have this. Fun for kids and adults.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was looking forward to this book. As a reader of the Harry Potter books I had high expectations for The Casual Vacancy. No I was not expecting Harry Potter but as described I was expecting a funny and enjoyable book. What I got instead was a plodding read on subjects that one would hardly call comedic.<br /><br />The book starts off bad. The first 1/4 of the book is a hodge podge of characters thrown together in a form that makes it extremely difficult to keep track of. You're 10 pages on one character and then 15 on another and so on with nothing connecting them making it difficult when they pop up another 50-60 pages later to remember who this was previously. It's just bad writing which makes the whole book more difficult to enjoy. Things do improve about 1/3 of the way through as she begins to mix the characters together but still it's a long slog to get there.<br /><br />In terms of the characters themselves none of them are people you can identify with or even like. Drug users, spousal abusers and teenagers being nasty to each other generally describes the character list. It's really hard to care about any of them... no, make that impossible because they're all just nasty people doing cruel things to each other. Most of the people in the book get simple joy from being cruel to others and that generally seems to be their motivations through the whole thing. The remaining few characters serve simply to be the victims and generally are so weak and pathetic you can't even feel sorry for them.<br /><br />The book itself is described as a dark comedy. Dark is an accurate description but a comedy? This book is about as funny as a tooth ache. If you find nasty people being cruel to each other funny then perhaps you'll find the book humorous but I didn't.<br /><br />I liked Rowling's Harry Potter books and the sense of humor she showed in them so when I heard about this book I was expecting something witty and entertaining which is basically how this book was publicized to be but it's neither. Joan Rowling is a talented writer as she has proven in the past, so to have her come out with something this poor is a major disappointment. I look forward to her next book as I know she's capable of much better than this mess.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this is a great game. if you are looking for something mindless to do, this is the game for you.
B001CTGQBK|2.0|This has to be the worst blue ray dvd I have ever seen. The clarity and sound was bad just ruined a classic film.
B009KZZM8G|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed the ability to buy and download my favorite TV show on my Kindle. This is an equally amazing NCIS story.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I have all 4 seasons of Castle, I love this show! It is the reason I can't wait until Monday!!
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Not so much. Cheesy. Very predictable. I would not watch it again. Close to an 80 movie. Not for me
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This is a great movie for adults , might give the kids nightmares ! It kept me very interested throughout the whole movie .. is a must see.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Took an unexpected turn. Riveting book, lots of unexpected things happen in this book. would definetely recommend this book to a friend
B0095R64AO|2.0|This movie was not that great. I was excited and disapointed. It was just really slow . They could have cut out about an hour of it.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a great read for anyone who fell in love with Christian Grey. Well written, believable story line, good character development. Also, tastefully written love scenes.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Really liked this movie. It held my attention. The story and the character's were good. Much better than I thought!!!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Anthony Ryan is going on my list of Favorite Fantasy authors.  Loved the plot!  Loved how everything was not so predicatable.  I had some issues with his character development of some of the characters, but this is Anthony's story...not mine.  Cannot wait for book 2!  Hopefully I won't have to wait too long.
B007ORVC36|4.0|The Young Turks (Peggy and Pete) are battling against the older guard (Roger and Don) who are no longer pulling their weight. Don comes into work with a post-coital glaze and has no idea what's going on around him. Roger does nothing but pretend to work. Too bad Pete's such a sleazy role model. The little burlesque number from Meghan at his birthday party is delightful, but I can see why Don would be embarrassed.<br /><br />Each new season sometimes seems to be written with no reference to the last one. What's that creepy Charles Addams house that the Draper kids are living in now? Dr. Fay Miller, poof! Gone?
B0091REZMW|5.0|fun and interesting. I really enjoy the graphics. this game keeps me very entertained.  I hope others get to enjoy it.
1442353279|5.0|Even though I already know a lot of this from books and various other sources, it was a very entertaining read/listen (audio book).Really, how many people do you know or have you even heard of have come from such humble roots and have achieved such success? A farm boy, the most famous bodybuilder, the highest paid action star at the time and finally the governor of the sixth largest economy (California), amazing. It should be an inspiration to those of us here who think we are so entitled to success just because we're here. Humbling...
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This fun and fascinating app keeps the player wondering what's just around the bend in new furnishings, decor and menu offerings. Greatly diverse game thanks to Team Lava! Worth the time!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Beat the game kinda quickly, but you can keep playing through again on a harder level. Pretty fun little matching things in a row game.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just could not put it down,everything about it is intriguing. The only problem i have is that it takes too long for the next book to come out...
B007THA4FI|5.0|Fantastic read! I could not put it down. J.K. Rowling's character development is outstanding. Would recommend this to everyone!! I look forward to more books from her.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I'm a Depp fan.  This movie did not disappoint. He looked good in it- sounded good, and that's really why i watch.  I am amused and intrigued by him.  The movie's plot very vaguely took me back to the 'after school' soap.  Under thirteen crowd watched it with me and twice i needed to distract their attention. The first time was upon us quick.
B008NABUU8|5.0|I love this game. I have not had the force closed problems that some have talked about and those complaints about getting tired of watching the cars and truck falling in the water well the point is to keep them out of the water so if you did a better job at building the bridge you would not have to watch them fall.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This case is perfect!  It's very lightweight and has a soft exterior.  The strap is also very useful and it's quite durable.  I did tons of research comparing all of the different options and if you don't want a leather case or a pattern print, this is the way to go!
B008NEMN0K|5.0|This review is for the 3D version of the film \\"I Robot\\". Just got mine,(on its release date),and all I've got to say is, this dvd has got some of THE best 3D I have ever seen. BAR NONE! I understand it wasn't shot in stereo, however, some of the 3D is actually better than some that were. Coulda fooled me. All other studios with your massive catalogues of dvds take notice! This is no joke. I'm thinking with most of the 3D films out there done in post anyway,(not shot with stereo cameras ),this is a no-brainer. \\"I Robot\\" looks as though it was planned shot by shot for 3D, filmed in 3D, and distributed in 3D. As my 24 yr.old son and I watched this dvd on my 65 inch LG 3D set,<br />he said to me, \\"There's no way you could convince me this dvd wasn't originally in 3D if I didn't know it for sure already.\\"<br /> So, all you other studios need to get on board with this. It's gotta be a money maker. I mean, it's not like you don't already have the property. Yes?<br />  Maltz
B008OB1QFK|5.0|This album is GREAT. Chris has a great voice and he know how to write songs. Very rare when all songs on album are good.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Droid X2: After each level the game would quit. It saved progress on the first 4 or so, so I could still keep playing, but on the match-the-object level in the armory it wouldn't save before it crashed, so I was unable to progress any further. Unfortunate, since I like the game.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|well... the money is on the screen no doubt, but like the 30 minutes subplot in the revenge of the fallen with the parents being kidnapped and sam having to haul ass 4 miles to prime on foot.....pointless, boring....in the third movie the whole rescue of sam's girlfriend is idiotic , planes shooting aliens at  point blank distances...like in the second movie, when missiles from planes have 30+ miles range accurate range and they engage point blank, absurd.....well it is just action for the sake of action, the same with the helicopters and the wing suit drops.....totally absurd, if jets cant get close what chance a few heavy transports have?....... , also the huge worm alien eating buildings ......in both the second and third movies there is a half an hour of absurd stuff which ruins the movies...., i dont know whose writers do these movies have  but the middle parts dont make any sense.....<br /><br />also dropping megan fox for an even worse actress just because she said something spielberg didn't like, what an arrogant pair spielberg and May......<br /><br />like the second it should have been much better
B007U8UBGI|5.0|Blunderbuss, in my opinion, is some of Jack White's best work. It's not often I find an entire album of music to listen to (start to finish). Blunderbuss is an exception. The instrumentation is fantastic. The lyrics are thought-provoking. Some of the songs are laid back like Love Interruption....some are in your face like Sixteen Saltines. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this album. In fact....I think I'll listen to it again today!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Amazing book & very interesting plot. i cant wait to read the rest of the addicting book series yay!  ppl
B009JBZH54|5.0|very good movies all have lots of action the villains are very good jokers they are and cats that steal
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Anyone who has read and enjoyed the graphic novel needs to see this movie. It looks just like the comic was drawn and follows the story exceptionally well. A MUST SEE for any batman fans or fans of the graphic novel!
030758836X|4.0|This book was fantastic!  I couldn't put it down.  There are so many twists and turns that I did not see coming!  I love books that I can't predict!  It is a must read!  I highly recommend it!
0525950079|2.0|While this book and its predecessor rate above normal romance fiction, this one in particular lacks any tightness and concise writing.  And it is too much in formula of \\"pillars of the earth\\" to offer any surprises.<br /><br />Once again, there is a \\"McGuffin\\".  In the first book, it was proof that the White Ship was deliberately sunk..  In this one, it's proof that Edward II was not murdered.  There is an inexplicably violent villain, who will no doubt die horribly, and another villain with a mommy problem.  This time it turns out to be the evil monk.  The characters have no depth, or unpredictability, like real people.  Each is either all good, or all bad.  They never fail to act just as we would expect.<br /><br />There is lots of sex (not much foreplay, ever), and bloody violence, and harrowing situations.  There is a huge cast of characters, and whenever it threatens to get out of control, Follet uses the Black Death to thin things out.<br /><br />Toward the end, it's as if he can't figure out how to end it--things just keep happening for no reason, the McGuffin turns out to be irrelevant.  This could have used either more character development, or, if they were going to remain stick figures, it could have been 300 pages shorter.<br /><br />The best thing in both books is the explanations of medieval building techniques, which are actually quite interesting.  They deserved a better fictional context.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book should have probably been marketed to young adults. The characters are very young and somewhat unrealistic. I loved the storyline however. It kept my attention. I found the book hard to put down and it kept a smile on my face. I could not help, but root for them. I am looking forward to the sequel.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie together two weeks ago.  My husband is not a \\"live it out loud\\" kind of believer.  He typically avoids what he deems \\"preachy\\" movies...he loved this!  This movie is everything a good movie should be, by turns hilarious and devastating.  This is the type of movie that will influence those with weak faith to closely examine their lives and those with strong to feel affirmed but challenged.  Although long, I never felt the plot dragging. As soon as it threatens to become maudlin or cliched it moves on, just as life does.  Again, my husband would normally consider this movie a \\"christian chick flick\\" and sit there in a coma watching you tube while I watch my movie, but he actually sat on edge watching the whole thing.  I should mention we have a 17-mo-old child, so maybe it touched the dad in him, but regardless, amazing film!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|love this app. It's so much better then the I heart radio app. will continue useing this in the future.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|It's fun and challenging with a good pace to it. Definitely a good game for free though I doubt I would have played for it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I agree with other reviewers, once diamonds are gone its hard to play - but not horrible. It just takes longer to complete tasks and advance levels.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|Worked like a charm for a few weeks and then eventually, it kept losing connectivity. A few more days later, it wouldn't even charge anymore. Really disappointed with this item. The normal double A batteries would probably give you a better life span that this item.
B007N0REX6|2.0|I thought the album (since it is their latest) would contain more songs like they did at their concert in England, Slash's hometown. It only contained two. I really loved the concert they did at the Guitar Center in LA. That was GREAT!!! As a GNR and Velvet Revolver fan, I guess I was expecting something a little different. Maybe their next album will contain the lost songs like Starlight, etc......
1439153663|5.0|Although I loved The Help, To me this book was much better. I enjoyed reading it and could not put it down. The story line was so interesting and full of events. The characters were well developed and seemed real. I think that it would make a great movie. Highly recommended!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Cut the Rope: Experiments is an excellent sequel. The first box gets you used to playing the game, only mechanics there are ones from the original, so you don't need to play the original to be good at this one. Then, they go on to add new concepts not featured in the original. It is still challenging and fun to me. If you like puzzle games, you will enjoy this. Works well on my Motorola Atrix.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am probably a little older than the usual Science Fiction reader but I have always loved it. I am 64 years old and female and this is probably one of the best science fiction books I have ever read. The thing I really loved is that there is no unnecessary crudeness. Sometimes I feel like books are being written by 6th graders that think they are being naughty but are really just being annoying.This story is completely satisfying and I cannot recommend it enough. Thank you Hugh Howey and now that I have found you I will be reading more.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|im just writing this so it stops asking me to rate it. please leave me alone you stupid app. words words words words words
B0091THDOM|5.0|Arrival was timely and case works perfectly. This is my second Snugg. I also got a Snugg for my iPad. Very high quality and work as advertised.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm very glad that I picked this up as a Kindle Daily Deal, because otherwise, it may have taken longer for me to hear about this great author.  Little did I know when I picked it up that it would be the first book I read by my new favorite author.  It's got a really great story and the world building puts you right in the middle of it.  Looking forward to picking up #6.
B009B2U73I|4.0|Album grows on you with each listen. Didn't really care for it at first and then it suddenly started sounding beter and better.
0316227706|5.0|Brilliant!<br /><br />Photographers everywhere are saying \\"why didn't I think of that\\"? Those with access to swimming pools will no doubt try to imitate Seth's technique (good luck--underwater photography isn't easy). But Seth has nailed it, with a one-of-a-kind art book of dogs like you've never seen them before.<br /><br />As a dog photographer (phoDOGraphy.com), I own every book of dog photos I've ever found that looked the least bit interesting. Until now, my favorites have been by Elliot Erwitt (uncanny, subtle humor) and Rachel Hale (drop dead gorgeous pet photos). But this is the first dog photo book I've seen that is literally one laugh-out-loud (and goreous, too) photo after another. I have a new favorite, and yes, I wish I had thought of it (and that I had a swimming pool).
B0090OW7J4|4.0|Album is up to expected standards for John Hiatt. Good tracks and lyrics. Definitely worth the time to take a good listen.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I have not completely finished the book yet, but I am liking it enough so that I ordered the second book in the trilogy, Winter of the World. The author has done great research in the background of World War I, or as it was known then, the Great War. I did not give the book 5 stars for two reasons.  One because I personally did not enjoy the detailed descriptions of the battles, but I do understand that they are important in the dynamics of the war. Second, the interactions of the four families across the globe are a little far fetched, but it certainly makes good reading. All the characters are very well developed and the reader can't help liking or hating them. I recommend this book and I am already looking forward to the second in the series.
B008LVCKH6|4.0|Loved this booked. It brings elements of Forrest Gump with the twists you would expect in a Swedish story. Very well written and captivating, could not put it down.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Neither the man or the woman main characters were like able.  The book felt like the beginning of a story not finished.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Can't stop playing! Even my 4 year old is attracted tobit. Nice graphics too. Recommend this game as a simple but yet some thought provoking pastime.

B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have to admit at first I was a little leary when I started. It read like a childs book, Or at least to me. However when I got into it, which took about 5 minutes, I didn't want to stop. So many lessons to be learned from such a strange little book. The author is not the most descriptive but I still found myself watching it, feeling the frustration, etc.<br />I know this is not a book for everyone but I personally loved it. I think it has a very strong message and one that we all need to think about sometimes.  Nice for a change to read something other than mindless words. Great book!
B0014JLYS8|5.0|I work 12+ hrs/day and these shoes work great for me. I found that by adding Dr. Schools massaging gel inserts, It takes the shoe to another level. What I really like is the fact that these shoes fit very well, but at the same time they feel very roomy, so adding the inserts doesn't make the shoe feel too tight like it does with other brands. If you're looking for a great non-slip work shoe, I'd say you need not look any farther!
0545265355|5.0|These books were three of the best to be written yet! Loved the movie and I can't wait for the next two to be filmed. The Hunger Games trilogy is just plain AWESOME!!!!! To anyone who has not read them but seen the movie: please read the books because the books have WAY more details that are not shown in the movie. Hope that more people read them 'cause this trilogy's a keeper!
0060873175|3.0|Suffice it to say that the plot was wonderful for light reading, but the story was written so dully, the writing so dry, that it took me forever to force myself to finish this novel.  Richard Preston did a good job of finishing it after the author's death, and there were a few very exciting scenes of human versus bugs, but other than that, it dragged and I found it extremely hard to read and focus on.  But if you're a Crichton fan (I am not much of one), this last novel is worth reading, if for no other reason than that there won't be any more.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this alarm because I can have music as my alarm, and I LOVE MUSIC!!! It also lets you pick out colors!

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|A great book with a twisted ending!! Great story line. I love how the combined the Greek demigods with the Roman demigods
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|listen this is great. addictive and fantastically timed. worth every penny even though its free. coin generation is sometimes annoying but worth it.
B00962341U|5.0|This is in my top 3 best albums of all time,ever! This album cannot really be explained but a word i can use is transcendent! This in my opinion is what every diva in the history of music dreamt of being. Not even Whitney Houston can touch this and i loved her too!Mariah and all the well known divas should learn from Leona and go back to their roots to actually produce something this life changing and soul shattering! Everytime i hear one of her amazing songs and the meaning of it i feel like my very existence is being changed into something more innocent and pure!Just like Michael Jackson changed a generation with thriller, GLASSHEART is the generation changing  album of our time.Leona ,God has truly blessed you with this talent and the time it took you to make this album was worth every second! We all waited and finally the wait is over!
B009CPES4I|5.0|This is a wonderful story. Colorful, heartwarming, humerous and sad! Gives a beautiful birds eye view of India. You won't regret renting or buying it.
B007TK77QE|3.0|I had expected this book to be as brilliant as the first Harry Potter book but it wasn't. Not because there was no magic, not because it was an adult book but because I expected JK Rowling to surprise me and she didn't.<br /><br />It was well-written, it was a good story but it could have been written by anyone who can write.It took a while to get to know the many characters but when I knew them I did want to know what was going to happen to them. I enjoyed the story as it's a good story but I hope her next one has that JK Rowling sparkle that leaves you saying: That was amazing!
1451696191|5.0|I love the book mostly because it reminds me of the 70's and 80's. Supposedly it is set int he 1990's but I recall the Rocky Horror Picture Show was popular in the 80's and many activities that are highlighted were most relevant in high school in the 70s and the 80s. Having said that, it is rather timeless in the themes and concerns it raises: who am I if I don't fit into the crowd? How does the environment shape who we become? Can a strong identity overcome peer pressure? Etc. I am 54 years old and I liked it. I bought it for my 15 year old son who loved it. We went to the movie after reading it. It is sweet and adventurous and a book about coming of age for a shy person.
0395631246|1.0|This book took ten months for me to read. It was dull, boring, insipid, and writting on a level much higher than it needed to be written on. I fully expect that less than 1% of those who bot this book read past the first chapter without falling asleep.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand. I have a PhD and understood the work but it would have been much easier for the millions of people who bot this book to get through if it had been written on a lower level.<br /><br />If you want to know about this book I suggest getting a book summary and think through that.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|This is her best album yet. Her voice has matured and so has her music. I'm glad she's gotten out of the tween population (except for 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together', not my favorite song on the cd, but one's not bad)Definitely the best if you are a Taylor fan.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Loved the movie, loved being able to laugh at a new take on an old story.  This movie is good for all, and I highly recommend it!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I wanted this for my husband & we watched this week and it was fantastic. Amazon were really quick & there was no problems with the product.
030758836X|3.0|This book started out kind of slow but made up for it in some pretty good plot twists. I was so excited to see how this story would end and I was very disappointed.
B000001F7R|5.0|1st heard this in Jr. High and thought it was great; next album better and then Def Lep went limp....too bad.
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|Lots of good effects and action. But like most of the other attempts of this book it falls Well short.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|awesome. I am totally addicted to this game. I play it all day and night. it is a must have.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Wow, I don't even know where to begin. This book is amazing to say the least! It took me a little while to get through the almost 600 pages, but they were needed to unravel the mystery that is Dorothy Nicholson. If this review seems a little vague, it is because I don't want to give away any spoilers; there are just so many events along the way.<br /><br />We start in 1961; Laurel is a 16 year old teenager hiding in the childhood tree house to escape from her sisters. Her Mother, Dorothy comes looking for the cake knife with her baby brother Gerry. Laurel is frozen in shock when she witnesses the most horrific crime. Laurel and her mother are the only people that know what truly happened on that day.<br /><br />Dorothy Nicholson is the best Mother any child could have; she is so creative and full of fun. The children are never without a story. Now in the present and Dorothy is in hospital, she is frail, old and dying. Laurel is visiting with Dorothy and the mystery of the crime is still fresh in her mind. Her Mother is muttering about mistakes and regrets. Laurel cannot forget what happened on that fateful day back in 1961 and decides to find out why it happened and how. Laurel takes it upon herself to investigate her Mother's past. Her brother decides to help and they both go on the hunt.<br /><br />Going back to 1941; WW2 is in full swing and Dorothy has left her parents and brother behind to find her destiny in London. Dorothy has a boyfriend, a job and then meets the Lady across the road, Vivien. Vivien is the friend that can help Dorothy go places in society. Horrible things start to happen to Dorothy, sad news and betrayal. Dorothy seeks revenge. This revenge is a plan; things don't go right and Dorothy has to flee.<br /><br />What happened to Dorothy's boyfriend Jimmy? What is the betrayal that makes Dorothy want revenge? What makes Dorothy commit the crime that ruined Laurel's childhood? Who is Dorothy from 1941? Can Laurel unravel the mystery that is her Mother?<br /><br />The whole story flows along beautifully, travelling from 1941 to 1961 to 2011 finding all the clues to Dorothy's past. This is such a beautiful story and the twists along the way are so shocking you are left speechless. The historical part of the book is amazing and in such detail, right down to the clothes and attitudes of the day. Full of action, suspense, romance, fun and the tissues are needed (well for me anyway). This is the first book I've read by this author and I am stunned. I will certainly be picking up her others.ther?<br /><br />The whole story flows along beautifully, travelling from 1941 to 1961 to 2011 finding all the clues to Dorothy's past.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|This is the strongest knife I have ever owned, it would be nice to have Micarta handles already on it, but I'll have to buy some eventually. I am going to replace the hex key screws and nuts and put stainless steel screws and locking nuts in their place.<br /><br />I am going to buy a tek lok for the sheath to secure it sideways to my belt. The knife is a little hard to pull out of the sheath, but hopefully it breaks in and gets easier over time.<br /><br />The weight I thought was going to be heavier feeling, but it feels much more comfortable and lighter in my hand then expected, which is a good thing.<br /><br />I had to Break the sheath in by hand.<br />To get the knife to come out of the sheath easier, take the knife out and pull the sheath slightly open at its entrance over and over again with both hands until the opening is slightly more flexible, but don't over do it or over bend it. Now the knife should come out much easier.<br /><br />I don't really know what I am going to do with this type of a knife, but I just wanted to own an awesome knife like this in my life time, and if an emergency does arise that I need a knife like this, I've now got one. Also check out the Schrade Extreme Survival Knife.
B003SI5NX0|5.0|My daughter and I love this movie! I will definitely be buying it. A must see for all animal lovers.
B0009MWAVQ|5.0|What an amazing gift Scott Ross has bequeathed the world! That he was soon to die at the age of 38 makes it all the more fortuitous that he did the recording when he did.<br />Listening to his performances is sheer joy.<br /><br />That he recorded all 555 sonatas in just over a year, is nothing short of a miracle.<br />There are no words in our language to describe the thrill and perfection of his playing. Go and buy them and listen for yourself!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|A really great little tool for sharpening knives and other devices needing a fine edge. A must for every glove compartment and/or backpack! Great value!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I'd seen it three times and still purchased it because I loved it so much. I can't wait for more!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|when I first started playing, I though that it was too easy and breezed thru 90 levels and.thenthey started getting more and more challenging to the point where I end up playing for hours at a time. and still have hundreds of levels left to play.
