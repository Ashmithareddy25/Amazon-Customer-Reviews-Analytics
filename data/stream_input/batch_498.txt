B00000JLWW|5.0|I think James Cameron did great job writing Titanic. <br />The first time I saw the movie Titanic I was 7 years old. <br />I thought that the romance between Rose (Kate Winslet)  <br />and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a true story. <br />Because when the old lady was telling about the story that happened on the Titanic it looked like she was telling the truth. But now I'm 14 and I know that it's not true. I have seen the movie 10 times and I don't get bored. I liked how James Cameron made up the story. I really enjoyed it.  I really sob.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet did a good job too. One thing that makes me cry too is that to many people died in real life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />My favorite part was almost at the end. When Jack and Rose went to the front of the Titanic because they didn't want to fall to the water. This story was so romantic. I recommend this movie to teenagers because I liked the movie and I think that they are going to liked it too.  <br />
0385512104|5.0|I disagree with some of the reviewers who stated it was strange to read from the point of view of an autistic teenager. Although it was 'different' I wouldn't necessarily call it strange. I really enjoyed this novel and could barely put it down. It made me laugh and also feel for the character. I like how the book incorporated different situations. I definitely recommend it.
B00000I8BX|4.0|I am not a big fan of metal music in general, but I did like this cd for its extreme bombast and intense power of its messages.  It is very thick and a little repetative, but it is still enjoyable.  Fear Factory is definitely a favorite band of hard core metal fans; whenever I mention the band to people who are fans of metal they seem surprised that I have heard of it.  THis is their best cd and if you are at all curious, you should go get it.  I had the original version of this cd at one point, but I got rid of it because I hadn't  been listening to it for awhile.  Now I kind of wish I had it back.  Of course, now I have an excuse to get these bonus tracks!
0060930187|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite novels. There's just something about it, that even if you're not feeling depressed you could relate to it. Even though it was written so long ago I can still relate to some of the things she says in the novel. I borrowed this book from the library but I'm planning to buy it soon because it's something I would enjoy reading again once in awhile. I definitely recommend it.
0003300099|5.0|C.S. Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.<br /><br />To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.<br /><br />Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...<br /><br />How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.<br /><br />Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.<br /><br />Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading.being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch.

B00097A5I6|5.0|well today on May 31st, 2005 i bought the new OASIS album.<br />Why?<BR>because in 1995 Oasis released a brillant album called &quot;What's the Story? (Morning Glory)&quot; which made Oasis on of the biggest bands around in 1995. Then after that they released three albums along with a b-sides collection from their first two albums (Definitley Maybe / What's The Story) and a live disc and dvd. All of that has failed of the greatness of there 1995 release. but now in 2005 they release &quot;Don't Believe The Truth&quot; and they Ringo Starr's son on drums.<br />this album is amazing! with Zak on the drums they have a much fuller sound and the sound flow is nice, also it's not Noel writting all the sounds anymore, they're more of a band. which was also the case on the previous album &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot;. The sound of the this album reminds of the classics such as The Beatles, and Rolling Stones. But it's also like Spiritualized. <br />check out the songs &quot;Turn Up The Sun&quot;, &quot;Importance of Being Idle&quot;, &quot;Part of the Queue&quot;, &quot;Let There Be Love&quot; and there new single &quot;Lyla&quot;.<br />This album is top shelf.

B000001G53|4.0|PARSIFAL, Richard Wagner's last work, is perhaps the most controversial. It is Wagner's interpretation on the Holy Grail stories, and in it we see Wagner's unique spirituality as well as what appears to be a feeling of contempt of organized religion. He believed in his musical genius in this work, and desired that it never be performed outside of his own theatre at Beyreuth, believing people should make a pilgrimage to be exposed to the music. The pirated copies of the score that eventually made it into the hands of other opera houses, particularly the Metropolitan Opera in New York, is a fascinating footnote in opera history.  Lawrence Gilman, a lover of Wagner's music and the author of a book titled WAGNER'S OPERAS states that PARSIFAL has always had its detractors. Because the music is so beautiful, some untrained listeners admire its beauty which makes musical snobs look askance at it. Some object because a person like Wagner would attempt to tackle religious subjects, and others are opposed to religious themes in the opera period. Today we may not find the same objections, but PARSIFAL recordings and performances can still cause quite a stir. Some may wonder if anyone can truly perform this score.<br /><br />Some may argue that the Deutche Grammophon recording with the Berlin Philharmonic under the direction of Herbert Von Karajan may be the bets available. Karajan, who can at times have a \\"conductor as god\\" approach to music, had been criticized for his large orchestral sound that at times drowns out the nuances of the music. For a score such as PARSIFAL, this would be deadly, yet he has tremendous control of the orchestra and we seem to hear things in his rendition that brings out the majesty of Wagner's music. All of the soloists do an adequate job. The Amfortas of Jose Van Dam and Gurnemanz of Kurt Moll are exceptional. We sense the pain and desperation of these two characters in these powerful voices. The Kundry of Dunja Vejovic can be harsh at times, and Peter Hoffman's portrayal of the title character of Parisfal is inconsistent at times, but neither ruin the recording and it is still an exemplary set. The chorus of the Berlin Opera is magnificent as well, always in control and never bombastic.<br /><br />Since its release in the early 1980's, this recording has an honored place in many music collections. I know I have enjoyed it many times over and seem to discover a new gem or nuance every time I hear it. I hope you do too.nd Peter Hoffman's portrayal of the title character of Parisfal is inconsistent at times, but neither ruin the recording and it is still an exemplary set.

B00000DCH9|5.0|Billy Joel's major label debut album showcased his vocal and songwriting talent and set the stage for what was to come.<br /><br />As we would learn on Behind The Music, part of this album tales came from his time on the West Coast, \\"Piano Man\\" and his trip back home to the East Coast \\"Your My Home\\", and the struggles long the way.<br /><br />\\"Captain Jack\\" long a concert favorite, and in the recent past reserved for tour stops in Philly (thanks to WMMR supporting this track back in the day) has to be the ultimate 70's angst song, with \\"The Ballad of Billy The Kid\\" a tamer alternate.<br /><br />To me the strongest song on this offering is \\"If I Only Had The Words (to tell you)\\". I am so sick of always hearing relationship songs sung by female artists, and in turn always blaming the guy for whats goes wrong.  As an old saying goes It Takes Two to Tango, and with the track Billy spills his heart out yearing for something more meaningful, that clearly has been lost on his girlfriends at that time. Few straight male artists have the guts to sing a track like this.
B00082IJ08|5.0|First of all, let me start by saying that I am a big fan of the first Gorillaz album, the G-Sides and the Space Monkeys' dub mixes. I was very excited for this album to come out and I was not disappointed at all. This album is as good as the first if not better. The band told us this would be a darker album and it is.  <br /> <br />I do want to warn you that if you are hoping for a \\"tight\\" rap CD, you might be disappointed. Gorillaz is not a \\"rap band\\". Rather, they are a band that combines all kinds of genres (including some rap) and have achieved a very unique and original sound. <br /> <br />Some people have complained about D-2's voice, but I think it sounds as good as ever. It does sound a bit like what's-his-name from Blur, but he clearly has his own sound.  <br /> <br />Someone said they were disappointed that Russel wasn't on it, but he is. He is the drummer and there are drums in nearly every song. He used to be possessed by the spirits of his rapping friends who would come out now and then in songs like Clint Eastwood, but he's had the spirits exorcized and the band have invited some real life rappers to fill the void. By the way they do a pretty good job. <br /> <br />Someone complained that All Alone has a Mickey Mouse sing along sound. I guess I can hear a voice that sounds like a cartoon on it, but then again THIS IS A CARTOON BAND! <br /> <br />Awesome album. Buy it. Buy it with the DVD for the packaging alone.   <br /> <br />El Manana, Every Planet We Reach is Dead, DARE, and All Alone are my favorites. <br />
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|this album sucks as far as i'm concerned, i mean they've gone all soft. system of a down is supposed to be heavy just like toxicity but they tried something new and i dont like it. the only good song is byob. in alot of the songs it just seems like they've gone soft. it just sounds like a whole new band, toxicity is my favorite album ,my second favorite is steal this album, but this cd it justs seems like u cant go crazy listening to the songs. They're not the la metal band in this album, they are the la rock sh*t band with this album. they need to go toxicity in their hypnotize album.
B00097A5I6|1.0|The one star is for Liam's hair on the inside cover. At least that still has it's dignity.  <br /> <br />As for the music, I believe they have finally lost their touch.  <br /> <br />The Importance of Being Idle, Part of the Queue, and Let There Be Love are mediocre. Unfortunately, all of the other tracks are completely unlistenable. <br /> <br />It's sad that a band who was once so great are putting out this kind of trash, but luckily for their fans, they let us down slowly with Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants and Heathen Chemistry - so at least it didn't come as a big surprise. <br />
B00003CWRX|5.0|Okay, so I'm trying to be helpful here, and I guess my origional review was not.  I can't help it that to me this movie is just a Russell Crowe showcase, but I guess I should elaborate a little better. <br /> <br />This is my origional review for all of you curious: <br /> <br /> <br />I've been a huge Russell Crowe fan since seeing Gladiator and I've made it a point ot see all of his movies.  I just can't believe I waited this long to see The Insider.  This is easily one of my favorites.  Just wonderfully done, Russell conveys emotion that most actors are unable to do (with the exception of a few)...Russell is very much my favorite actor, and all predudice aside I believe he is the greatest actor of our generation, and I'm sure many to come.  This movie was perfectly put together, every element was perfectly placed.  It is well deserving of praise.  I'm not a big Pucino fan, but he pulled out the stops here.  Awsome performance Al, but the show stealer is once again Mr. Crowe.  Great work Russell...can't wait for your next ride. <br /> <br /> <br />Now THIS is my new review: <br /> <br /> <br />First off, I love movies based on true life stories.  It gives you a chance to see what happens to real people as aposed to fictional charactors.  So our REAL life story here is based on Jeff Wigand (Crowe) who once worked for Bronson & Bronson (If I remember correctly, I may be off a bit) a big tobacco company.  He is wrongfully fired for not seeing eye to eye with the production department.  Upon being fired Wigand is contacted by 60 Minutes (namely by Pucino) who wants him to pretty much rat out big tobacco.  The problem is Wigand sign a confidentiality agreement with his former company and if you renigs they will take away severence package including his health benifits, and he can't lose that for he has an asmatic daughter.  The movie revolves around the struggle of morality.  Do you make the moraly correct choice even if it means you lose everything you have, your home, your job, your family or do you keep quiet and save face?  My wife thought the movie was slow and boring, but not I...I loved the movie and thought it carried an extremly powerful message. <br /> <br />PS>  Russell was amazing as usual!
B00006BTCA|4.0|Looking at the front cover of the album, you see bright lights but they appeared to be dimmed... as if seen in a cold winter night. This is exactly the impression I get listening to this album. The music is lost in a vague arrangements of sounds but the melodies are ever present. While it may seem distant, it bhblends in together superbly and at times it s just too beautiful to describe. There is a sense of continuity in the musical texture as if the instruments were orchestrated. The vocals is superb, very dark with deep lyrics, but never takes over the excellent skills of displayed by the guitars, bass and drums.   While the album is very atmospheric, there is a definite sense of urgency to it, when you hear the guitars, alarm like sounding in Obstacle 1 or burning progressively in \\"untitled\\" or \\"nyc\\", which gives this album an amazing counterbalance between a frozen cold static \\"joy division\\" feel and a warm ever changing energy of the more contemporary prog rock scene.    Actual rankinng is 4.5 stars but that can't be done here so I chose 4.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|First off, amazing, the film is just flawless.  The acting on all parts was a joy to watch.  I feel Paul Bettany was overlooked at the oscars, as was Russell Crowe who deserved that oscar a million times over.  His performance was moving and emotional, a flawless piece of art.  Jennifer Connelly well deserved her oscar.  She was stunning as usual and she was well matched with Russell since the two of them steal every scene they embody.  This is just a great film, period.  The film revolves around the true life story of John Nash, a famous mathmatician who suffered from scizophrenia.  The movie starts while John is in college searching for his origional idea.  He finds it, and ends up working as a teacher/informant kinda sorta for the government, making frequent trips to the pentagon.  He meets and falls in love with a student (Connoly) and they are married and soon she is pregnant.  That's when things get hard.  Nash gets a little paranoid beliveing the Russians are trying to kill him.  Soon he is in the hospital undergoing some primative electric-type therapy to cure him of his mental state.  The balance of the movie shows Nash's road to redemption and that road is long, hard and bumpy, but worth the ride.  Crowe's dedication to his roles is evident in the enjoyment you recieve from watching him on the screen.  Keep it up Russ.  This film ends on a happy note, a note actually so happy and heartwarming it may bring you to tears or at least give you the motivation to get up and clap.  If you want to see a film that will make you think, make you cry and make you smile then this is the film you should see.

B0009QTS1M|5.0|After looking at all my reviews I realized that this review does the film no justice and I just emphasize my fasination with anything Russell Crowe so I've decided to rewrite my review if in hopes to help a few appreciate a great and wonderful film.    My original review:    First of all I decided to write my review for Gladiator today and I pulled it up and now I just have to say I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY ARE RELEASING AN EXTENDED VERSION TO THIS MOVIE!!!  Now that I said all that...This movie introduced me to Russell Crowe.  I've been hooked ever since.  My wife says I'm obsesive, but who can blame me.  In this film Russell glows, he reaks of star, he oozes forward with OSCAR written all over him...Yes, there are other films that Russell owned, like A Beautiful Mind and the recent Cinderella Man, but this is what really got him noticed.  The story here is quite good for an action film, considering most action films lack (there are a few exceptions, like Armegedon & The Matrix for example)  There is pure emotion portrayed here by the entire cast, but notibly moreso in Crowe and Phoenix...The movie is quite gory, but please don't let that hinder you from watching this film...Ridley Scott brilliantly placed this film together and made one of the best films I've ever seen.  The battle's and fights are amazing and very well put together...everything about this film is eye catching.  I would recommend to anyone.  You won't be dissapointed.    And now, my new review:    Maximus (Crowe) is a loyal general of the Roman army, a man devoted to serving his country, a man who left behind his loved ones to serve the Emperor Marcus Arelious (I know I butchered the spelling)...theres just one problem and that problem is the Emperor's some Comodus (Phoenix) who wants rulership after his fathers death, and since his father is unwilling to do so, wanting the Roman empire to fall back to the ways of the Senate, Comodus murders his father in order to attain rule.  After doing so he has Maximus taken out to be exicuted.  Maximus of course escapes and upon returning home finds his wife and son have been murdered.  The week and tired soilder then collapses and is found by traveling merchants as sold as a gladiator to fight in the Roman games Comodus has decided to throw in rememberence of his late father.  Here is Maximus's chance for vengence, and vengence he will have.  The film is spot on with a tight script and impressive acting on all fronts, a film that delivers solid action with an emotinal sucker punch.  Much praise for Crowe who gives us a look at an amazingly strong man, one who can rise above what he's been redused to in order to free himself from the pain.  Amazing and powerful film!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|People are coming back from the dead!  They're killing in the streets, in the alleyways, in the lawns!  But all Shaun cares about his his romance troubles--his girlfriend is breaking up with him.  And when he finally gets attacked by the zombies, he and his slacker roommate decide that they must save her--and Shaun's mother (though they seem delighted at the prospect of killing Shaun's step-father).  What ensues is horrifying, scary, shocking--and absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />This movie is extremely well acted; it's been a long time since I've seen this good of comic-timing in a movie.  And it's also disturbing and even scary; I shivered several times, and was on the edge of my seat the entire 90+ minutes.  And I was laughing the whole time; it's unusual, to be scared and laughing at the same time.<br /><br />There's also a bonus aspect of this movie: it serves as a great social commentary.  Lots can be said about the first fifteen or twenty minutes of the film, as Shaun ambles about the city, oblivious of the world slowly falling apart around him; and then, when he is forced to face the zombies, how he insists upon dealing with mundane things...for example, when he hits a man with his car, he backs up to see if the man is alright.  When the guy turns out to be a zombie, Shaun sighs and says, \\"Well, that's alright then.\\"<br /><br />Hilarious.  \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is one of those flicks you can watch again and again, because it's that good.  Superb acting, clever writing, an intriguing plot, and genuine laughs and thrills...lots of movies aspire to be like this (and lots are accidently), but \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" sets the bar.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|This little horror movie is full of tricks that'll grip you to your sofa. 2 people bound to the wall of a real damp and a corpse... They're the target of a mysterious serial killer. This one's got a real sick imagination. Behind the pictures and the clever-horrible scenes, there is a question about the survival instinct. And an interrogation will occur to you: \\"What would you do if you were the killer's target?\\" <br />\\"Saw\\" is a refreshing change from the classic plot of the white face serial-killer pursuing a naive girl in the woods. It IS scary. And it's smartly directed. <br />And if you're a fan of \\"Usual suspects\\" like ending, you'll get a psychotic one! <br />It's horrible, it's nauseous and it doesn't end well. <br />Want to try?

6304696566|5.0|I first saw this movie a time or two when I was a young man.  I didn't really understand why it was so highly thought of until I had read a biography or two of John Ford.  When I got a chance to see it later, I found myself seeing many subtle facets of what I had previously thought to a slow-moving action Western.  You see, this is NOT an action movie.  The fact that there are some gunfights throughout the movie probably mislead me thinking that it was about action.  It is about obsession instead: the obsession of a man to save his niece from what he felt was a fate worse than death.   <br /> <br />Ethan Edwards comes back from the Civil War and seems to be hiding a dark secret.  He visits his brother's familiy and, while there, they are attacked by Indians.  When Ethan returns to the site of the massacre of his brother's family, he realizes that the two daughters are missing.  They had been captured by the Comanches and Ethan sets out with others to search for them.  Time and distance causes most to drop out of the search and return to their own homes but Ethan continues his search over the course of a couple of years.  He has a couple of young men along to help out but it is Ethan who leads the way doggedly.   <br /> <br />As in most Ford movies, there is a community that is central to the understanding that individuals and actions are best understood in relationship to the society they come from.  Sometimes, we don't share Ford's sense of purpose along these lines because we're more drawn towards Ethan Edwards sense of purpose.  As a result, some scenes slow down the drama (as well as the action).  The film culminates in returning to society.  Edwards hasn't fit into society since he went off to war.  Now that his task is over, society has no use for him and no place for him as well.  In an unforgetable closing scene, Edwards knows that it's time for him to leave.  <br /> <br />There are many unforgetable scenes in \\"The Searchers\\" in addition to the closing one.The scene in which Edwards has to break the truth to Brad Jorgenson is about the best scene John Wayne ever did (and he's had a lot of memorable scenes over his career).  The team of Ford and Wayne has produced some of the best in American cinema over the years.  Other than \\"Donovan's Reef\\" I can't think of a single failure but there are plenty of classic; \\"Stagecoach\\", \\"The Quiet Man\\", \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence\\" to name a few.  These two men, along with Ford's standard stock players, have given us a story of how society needs men of uncommon strength to do the hard work in society's crises.  Yet, when the work is done, society often forgets and looks the other way.  Whether this was an allegory about the returning veterans or just a story about the special breed of man it took to win the West, it is a compelling study of a man with a mission.  Although it suffered from the accepted attitudes towards the Indians in the Western conquest, it is a story that continues to be impressive.  Just don't think of it as an action Western.
B000002LGA|5.0|Lou Reed once said something like (and the expletives have obviously been deleted) \\"Who is (name of a famous music reviewer) to criticize my work?\\" I worked my ... off for a year and he gives me a C+ ... \\" The original quote comes to mind because it is an appropriate response to some of the reviewers posted here.  <br />The naysayers? Well, as Lou's friend Donald might say, \\"Stick a fork in their a** and turn them over. They're done.\\" These might just be the same reviewers who constantly try to foist the Beach Boys are better than the Beatles theory on those of us who know better. All I can say about that insipid theory is, \\"Hey, knucklehead, compare the impact each had on the world.\\" Really, that comparison is paramount to comparing the Carpenters to The Who ... but hey, that's an argument for another time and place. <br />Meanwhile, (and I promise to cease my venting) I would place this album in the rerified company of such outstanding works of musical artistry as: the Kink Chronikles, Forever Changes, Odyssey and Oracle, Sgt. Pepper, and Can't Buy a Thrill. New York, in my opinion, is one of those rare musical treasures that come along all too infrequently. It is an album that you will listen to again and again because it has something to say, and Lou says what he has to say with guts and integrity. Surfs up...? Too many recording are reminders of how vapid and dull the world really is and it's a pity, but those reviewers who castigate Lou Reed for his \\"social commentary JUST DON'T GET IT. Lou ain't the Beach Boys, and if I were a beliver I would know just who to thank, but I'm not so I'll just thank Lou ... Thanks Lou... As for those of you who are just as tired of the critics and naysayers as I am, we can always follow the advice of Lou's friend Donald...    <br /> <br />Paul Merchant <br />
B00080Z53O|5.0|like other reviewers, I was crying hard throughout the entire movie. I don't think it matters if you agree with euthanasia or not, the movie goes much deeper than that. Each character is strong, and absolutely moving. The issues make you think about disabilities, death, life, poverty, love, friendship, family, etc... It's really a beautiful film, despite the final results. One of the best movies I've ever seen.
B0008G2IRO|5.0|This album blowed my mind !!! The groove coming out of every tunes, from start to finish, are very embracing and really take you out of this world.

0312305060|3.0|I have read so many novels lately, secure in the obviously naive notion that they have to be great because they were awarded the Pulizter Prize for fiction.  These include \\"Kavalier & Clay,\\" \\"Breathing Lessons,\\" \\"Empire Falls,\\" \\"Gilead,\\" \\"The Known World,\\" \\"Middlesex,\\" and this novel.  While all of these works are ambitious and at times astonishingly good, they are nevertheless disappointing.  In this novel, the author almost succeeds in weaving together the lives of three characters against the backdrop of Woolf's \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\"  Mr. Cunningham gives us snippets of brilliance, but on the whole his novel is contrived and self-important.

Like Babylon 5 and Angel, Firefly got little respect in its own era. But just you watch: It will grow like a cult, and perhaps better than that, will set a new standard for what mainstream should be. For whatever reason, Firefly was cancelled before it had a chance to grow.<br /><br />But grow it will. To coin a phrase, we will make it so...
B0007Y08IS|4.0|If the sight of marionettes having sex offends you, then Team America: World Police has done its job, and what a job. A silly spectacle from the South Park guys rifling on everything from Jerry Bruckheimer films to world politics, Team America effectively turns every cliche and genre on its termite-infested ear. <br /> <br />You want action? Team America delivers. You want romance. Team America delivers. You want to see Susan Sarandon tossed from a skyscraper? Team America doesn't just deliver, they deliver air mail. Creators Trey Parker, Matt Stone and co-writer Pam Brady don't have any one target on their radar. They toss as many poison pens as possible at the screen. <br /> <br />Team America, with it's gorgeous, detailed miniature sets captured in all their widescreen glory by Bill Pope, is the film equivalent of something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue. Resurrecting the 1960s camp of Gerry Anderson's Super-Marionation series as The Thunderbirds, Stingray and Fireball XL5, Team America adds an exaggerated new spin to the convention. <br /> <br />The filmmakers literally borrow dialogue from other blockbuster films, which in context sounds more authentic coming from a marionette, and then add a blue streak guaranteed to make members of the ratings board swallow their gum. <br /> <br />What emerges is a film that takes itself very seriously, at least in the first half. The filmmakers understand the films they are spoofing are already preposterous and pretentious, so instead of playing into that trap, they work around it. Even at its most outrageous, Team America plays it straight. Even the musical numbers, oh yes, there are musical numbers, are presented with utter conviction. <br /> <br />Like their destructive heroes, the filmmakers take no prisoners. They shamelessly take on everyone and everything, leaving no sacred cow un-tipped in their pursuit for a laugh. Their wood creations aren't just joints and wires, they have emotions andback story. The film's larger-than-life villain ponders his lonely existence, while the film's reluctant recruit, a Broadway actor named Greg Johnston, is still recovering from an unexpected family disaster. <br /> <br />Johnston is brought into the fold of Team America: World Police after their leader is killed by a terrorist in Paris. Team America may have leveled Paris in the process, but at least the charred streets of the City of Lights are safe again. Not so for the rest of the world, when evil despot Kim Jung II advances on his equally evil plans, forcing the Team to recruit Johnston to portray a terrorist and infiltrate the movement. The logic behind this decision is so insane it seems logical. <br /> <br />South Park still remains one of the funniest, bravest and most relevant shows on cable, and creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone continually prove their well is far from dry. Their first feature, Bigger, Longer and Uncut, viciously skewered censorship, effectively arguing through the mouths of foul mouthed fourth graders the people who hand out movie ratings are more concerned with sex than violence. <br /> <br />True to form, Team America, which depicts enough mindless violence and crimson paint to fill several Michael Bay films, ran into trouble because of a simulated sex scene between marionettes. So the lesson we take from this is blowing off a head is okay, but engaging in a sex act using the same word is not. Parker and Stone were tailor made for the ratings board, two overgrown frat boys who not only dare to push the envelope, they shove it into a paper shredder and make up their own rules. The filmmakers may revel in toilet humor, but at least they give us a courtesy flush. <br /> <br />The sex scene aside, Team America is top heavy with naughty bits guaranteed to either tickle your funny bone or snap your spine in half. The filmmakers understand the inherent humor in making a big-budget action film with marionettes, and when faced with the intrinsic limitations of the medium, use them as part of the gag. You can't help but laugh at the absurdity that these slow moving, limited-motion marionettes are the stars of an action film. At least their emotions are in check.

B0007TKNL0|3.0|As a theatrical production, Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera incorporates the audience into the action, forcing them to become witting accomplices to the romance and mayhem that surrounds them. When the Phantom emerges from the dark, wet catacombs of the opera house to haunt the current production, the theater audience, by design, also become his victims, and when that grand, glorious chandelier comes crashing down, they take it personally. <br /> <br />Except for the catalog of popular songs, which blast from the speakers in deafening Dolby, Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera has very little personality. Experiencing the pomp and pageantry is one thing, sitting back and watching it is another. It doesn't take long before you wish a chandelier would crash through the screen. You know a movie is in trouble when you're rooting for the lighting. <br /> <br />Filled with larger-than-life movie moments, what this Phantom lacks is a heart and soul. Those traits are built into the story and songs, but director Joel Schumacher and his cast leave little to be desired. What was once vibrant and stunning has become jarring and garish. As in the case of such great Hollywood musicals as Singing in the Rain and West Side Story, Phantom would have benefitted with the presence of two directors. <br /> <br />That would have allowed this Phantom to have his torte and eat it too. A dramatic director would have been able to bring some level of reason to the romance, helping counterbalance Schumacher's glitter and sequin production design. Phantom is pretty to look at, but that's part of the problem. It's too pretty. There's no nuance or menace in the lighting, robbing this Phantom of any expectation. When the Phantom is lit better than Barbra Streisand, he becomes picture postcard pretty. <br /> <br />That's because he's played by young Gerard Butler, whose jet black hair, chiseled jaw and porcelain doll complexion paint him more as a rock star doing a charityconcert than someone who has been scarred and abandoned by society. Up until now, the Phantom has been depicted as something of a monster, a musical genius forced to hide from life and love. One look at Butler's Phantom and you wonder what all the fuss is about. <br /> <br />It's hard to lurk around in the shadows when the dark corners of the opera house are better lit than most public restrooms. <br /> <br />Indeed, the production design is grand and glorious, every chamber, every street, every rooftop and catacomb a wonder to behold. Designer Anthony Pratt gives Schumacher his money's worth, but at what cost? Schumacher shortchanges the actors by forcing them to compete with the scenery, inflating every emotion to match the wallpaper. His cast is serviceable but not spectacular, something this Phantom deserves. Emmy Rossum is pretty and delicate as Christine Daae, plucked from the chorus line by the Phantom to star in his new opera. When the Phantom speaks, people listen, and when they don't, people die. <br /> <br />So when the man behind the mask falls for Christine, he sets off a romantic tug-of-war with her suitor, Raoul (Patrick Wilson), who vows to keep Christine safe from the music of the night. Webber and Schumacher have refashioned Gaston Leroux's 1911 novel into an amusement park ride that just keeps spinning its wheels. It doesn't take long before the ride becomes tiresome.
B0009I7NOO|4.0|If you are an Oasis fan, you will LOVE this CD! It ranks as my 3rd favorite Oasis album after Definately Maybe and Morning Glory. I only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't have the iTunes bonus track, \\"Pass Me Down the Wine.\\" However, BEWARE of the DualDisc. The CD audio side would not play on my iMac OR my Dell PC!! I had to buy the regular version so I could load it onto my iPod. iMac users BEWARE of the DualDiscs!!!
B00080ZG10|5.0|The Aviator gets it right. That's all there is to it. Masterfully directed, intelligently written, beautifully acted, and always engaging, The Aviator is a true Hollywood movie. It soars, it entertains, it makes you swoon and cringe, and when all is said and done, you leave the theater feeling like you haven't wasted three hours of your life. <br /> <br />I'm not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but damned if he doesn't just rock my socks as a young Howard Hughes, a man so full of spit and vinegar anyone in the first three rows better be wearing a raincoat or tossing a salad. Under Martin Scorsese's affectionate direction (he literally embraces everything on the screen), DiCaprio becomes the maverick entrepreneur turned movie maker turned aviation pioneer, perfecting his every nuance and tick. This isn't a performance or even an impersonation. DiCaprio becomes Hughes. <br /> <br />The life of Howard Hughes was extremely complicated, so Logan and Scorsese wisely concentrate on his early days in Hollywood, his fascination with breaking the air speed record, and finally his desire to take on TWA as the king of the skies. While we aren't treated to the later years where phobias and mental health issues took their toll, Logan's script does examine the events that might have laid the groundwork. DiCaprio is at his best when he begins tackling these demons, real or imagined. <br /> <br />Hughes had plenty of demons in his life, and one great compatriot in actress Katherine Hepburn, radiantly played by Cate Blanchett. A woman of wealth and breeding, Hepburn was also something of a tomboy, and enjoyed the spirited Hughes, even if also meant dealing with his evil spirits. I'm not sure how accurate The Aviator depicts their romance, but on screen, played by these actors, there's a real sense of love and friendship. When Hughes takes Hepburn flying and then allows her to take over the wheel, if there were any more electricity in the air the plane would explode. <br /> <br />TheAviator must have been a dream come true for Scorsese, a movie preservationist whose love of old Hollywood is unabashed. Scorsese's love affair carries over onto the screen. Every frame of The Aviator feels like a Valentine. How marvelous to recreate the classic landmarks, looks, stars, and even tone of the era. The Aviator is a real Hollywood movie, larger-than-life in scale, yet grounded by dynamic performances and meaningful dialogue. <br /> <br />The filmmakers manage to pack quite a punch into three hours, beginning with Hughes' first foray into Hollywood, the expensive, epic Hells Angels, and ending with the only flight of his expensive floating boat eventually nicknamed The Spruce Goose. His pursuit of the skies, air records, actresses, and corrupt government officials fill in the gaps, and not one stop on this journey feels like a pee break. Every conversation, event, specifically chosen and penned by Logan to personify Hughes. Logan idolizes Hughes, but rarely puts him on a pedestal. <br /> <br />Which makes this DiCaprio's bravest performance. With his slicked-back hair and strong jaw, he looks like Hughes, but isn't afraid to show us the ugliness inside. When Hughes suffers a breakdown in a screening room, stripping down to naked flesh, DiCaprio even goes further. He exposes the vulnerable boy hiding inside the body of a man.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|When I first spotted this Cd at my local HMV store, I was exceited. Afterall, Slipknot had gotten my attention with the first two albums (I had purchased all 3 versions of their self-titled album), and I was eager to hear the demonic growling and uptempo thrashing I had enjoyed in the prior albums. <br /> <br />However, I was disappointed when I put in their current release \\"Vol 3: The Subliminal Verses\\" which Im sure I would endure massive flaming from most metal heads who enjoyed this. <br /> <br />First off, there are 9 members, in the first 2 albums you could pretty much hear each individuals contribution to each song, but in this one, it seems to have taken 9 guys to do what most 4 guys in a band can do. <br /> <br />Which brings me to my next complaint, the vocals...has Corey lost the ability to scream and growl like he once did? I thought this was a Slipknot album, not Stone Sour, I bought it because I thought we'd hear some new tracks familliar to tracks such as 'Sic',  'Disasterpiece', 'Diluted', 'Purity'...what has happened? <br /> <br />Aside from their mask schtick and drumming, this album lacks all that had made them fantastic. If you're looking for an album like Iowa and 'Slipknot' stay away from 'Vol 3 Subliminal Verses' because the Subliminal verse in this album sounds like any other band they used to mock in their prior music.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|It's not that flat-mates Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) are clueless. They are. You just can't blame them for not noticing their neighborhood has been overrun with zombies. As Shaun of the Dead begins, it's difficult to tell the living from the living dead. We watch as people trudge through their everyday lives, so systematically beaten down they look and walk like zombies. <br /> <br />Irreverent, sly, and affectionately connected to its source material, Shaun of the Dead is a love story with bite. The gory story is grounded by a good natured sense of humor and a real desire to make a horror film that goes against the grain. Splatter fans will appreciate the rip and shred effects, but at the heart of the film is a love story. <br /> <br />Pegg is the perfect anti-hero, a man child who shares a flat with two school chums, one a responsible albeit anal-retentive gatherer and harvester; and Ed, a slob who plays video games all day. Ed gets by doing miscellaneous jobs, while Shaun feels out of place as the senior sales manager at an electronics store. When they're not getting by, they're getting drunk at the Winchester Pub. <br /> <br />It's there that Shaun decides to move forward on his relationship with Liz (Kate Ashfield), a woman tired of his empty promises. Their future hangs on an important dinner date that Shaun naturally forgets. Shaun is so distracted over the break-up he doesn't realize the severity of another problem: the city is being overrun with the living dead. <br /> <br />Shaun and Ed's clueless behavior is good for several laughs: they mock a zombie on the street, believing he's drunk, and a female zombie who winds up in their backyard. Once Shaun and Ed are up to speed, they become reluctant zombie fighters, roaming the city to save the people they love. That includes Shaun's mother and stepfather, who doesn't believe that a little bite could lead to anything serious. <br /> <br />By design, we're not supposed to take any of Shaun of the Dead seriously. Indeed, characters are put in situations of grave danger, but the set-ups and pay-offs are so rich in black humor that we find ourselves engaged in the film's excesses rather than turning away. <br /> <br />What elevates the film is its sense of purpose. The filmmakers aren't just content with stocking the story with nameless and faceless zombie happy meals, they give the characters and thus the story a support system that can withstand anything they throw at it. Most horror films attempt to break the ice with nervous laughter, but Shaun of the Dead celebrates its silliness. <br /> <br />The film is decidedly British, and American audiences might have difficulty discerning some of the dialects and phraseology. The situations and jokes are universal, especially when the character's survival skills kick in. Shaun and Ed may not be great warriors, but they're great entertainment. <br /> <br />Director/co-writer Edgar Wright and star/co-writer Pegg take their cue from the works of Dario Argento and George Romero, and even Danny Boyle's recent 28 Days Later. The references should delight fans of zombie films, who will immediately recognize the homages. The performances are perfectly suited to the misfit nature of the story, with Pegg and Frost the biggest misfits in the bunch.
B000000WCV|5.0|I bought \\"Homework\\" after getting \\"Discovery\\" (a little over a year now), and was blown away!  This album exceeded my expectations, and this was their first effort?  I didn't believe it!  My fave tracks are \\"Revolution 909\\", \\"Da Funk\\", \\"Around the World\\", and \\"Rollin' and Scratchin'\\".  When someone mentions Daft Punk, especially \\"Homework\\", those are the tracks that come to mind.<br /><br />Because I live in Chicago, I heard \\"Around the World\\" on the radio in a club mix a while ago, when I was in junior high school, and you wouldn't believe the nostalgia that came flooding back to me when I heard the track.  I damn near had a heart attack; then proceeded to dance with my sister, who was in the room with me. My aunt heard it, and told me, \\"This sounds just like the music we used to dance to in high school and college!\\" And for her, that was a good...15-20 years ago!<br /><br />I also listened to \\"Daft Club\\" before listening to \\"Homework\\", and I prefer this one.<br /><br />If you like techno music, get this.  If you like club/dance music, get this.  If you like Daft Punk, get this.  Heck, if you like music, get this.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|my first set is marked out as \\"loaners\\" now and i just bought my second set so i can get my fix of firefly!  <br /> <br />i was lucky enough to get to see Serenity 4 months before it released, at oneof the prescreenings, and even with placeholder music and unfinished editing, the movie was honestly the best i have ever seen.  <br /> <br />would i have liked it so much if i had not seen firefly? probably not. it would have been a great movie, with the perfect mix of humor, romance, drama and action; but there was so much more emotional invesment and closure from having seen Firefly a few times.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended, there is not one person i know who has seen an episode that hasnt liked it.
B00097A5I6|5.0|Wow! This Is an excellent, excellent album!!  What a rewarding achievment for these guys man. From track 1 to 11 its non-stop, play all the way threw enjoyment. I love the heavy side of Oasis just as much as the next guy, but this album really turned that opinion completely around. Beautiful arrangements, catchy melodies, and a fresh new energy not really heard on any other album they have done in a while. What \\"3\\" was to Led Zeppelin, \\"Believe\\" is to Oasis. I don't have a favorite song on this album, they are all that good. All Oasis fans will (& should) appretiate and enjoy this album. Well ANYONE who still respects good music will 'definitely' appretiate this album of sure brilliance!
B00097A5I6|4.0|Oasis are back with a new album.  It is a solid effort that longtime fans will love and non-Oasis fans will dismiss.  There are some really great tracks on Don't Believe the Truth.  The opening track is a standard Oasis arena rocker.  The second song \\"Mucky Fingers\\" has all the markings of a strong protest anthem.  Who said Oasis' music doesn't say anything? In many ways Don't Believe the Truth has the most new Oasis moments since What's the Story Morning Glory.<br /><br />Whatever anyone thinks of Oasis they are one of the most influential guitar bands of the last ten years.  The band proves with this album they are not going away.  While Don't Believe the Truth does not rise to the level of Oasis' first two albums, it's their best effort since What's the Story Morning Glory?
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|The vocal shifting on this disc far tops any stretching Serj or Daron have ever done previously.  For that alone this CD is beautifully worked.  But add those crazy guitars and tempo-shifting traditions of System, and you have an even better Good Thing(r).  I'd thoroughly recommend this over any of their other discs, though their first release reaches pretty close.<br /><br />The trouble with comparing it to the rest of their library is that each album has been an experiment in an idea.  Toxicity was a chart-hopping, pop metal frenzy that garnered them much popularity beyond their start, but it lacked the socio-political edge and some of the crazier musical experimentation.  Steal This Album, on the other hand, is like some headbanger's hippie war protest.  Both of which are cool, but I feel like on this disc (barring the inclusion of whatever \\"Hypnotize\\" turns out like) they've returned to the roots that made us all love SOAD in the first place.  Buy the friggin' thing already.

B00030590I|5.0|This director seems to slip into action like a finely tailored shirt! I had no idea that he was more suited to dramatic movies than action. Jet Li makes the movie and should garner instant respect just for doing this movie. Excellent use of colors and the dialog is beautiful (Watch it in the original language, not english, it doesn't feel the same!) Most directors will die not coming up with something as amazing as this movie. His 2nd attempt at action is not quite as inspiring as this (Hous of Flying Daggers) but that is a review for another day.
B0000TB01Y|2.0|When listening to the music from Wicked, it struck me that most of the songs stink. The only good song is Defying Gravity. Everything else is sub-par. Chenowith gets annoying fast, as does Menzel. There is a reason it didn't win Best Musical and lost to Avenue Q! The music is nearly unlistenable. <br />I would have liked to hear the entire show on CD, not just the songs. And not even all the songs are on this album! Wicked Witch of the East isn't included! A Broadway soundtrack is supposed to be like listening to the show, the ENTIRE show. Shows like Phantom, Sweeney Todd, and Into the Woods come to mind. Listening to those albums is like listening to the complete show. Listening to Wicked is not. Its like listening to a bunch of weak songs surrounded by no plot whatsoever. <br />This is such a disapointment! The book was magnificent, and could have made an amazing broadway musical. Instead it got turned into a teenyboppers wet dream, filled with pop power ballads, bad songs, and bad comedy. The book was serious and would have made a beautiful, haunting show. Instead we got this.  <br />Hopefully they'll come out with a complete cast album someday, instead of this weak \\"spoiler-free\\" version.  <br />
0440224764|5.0|This is the best book by Grisham. I like this better than \\"The Firm\\". A suspenseful, taut thriller, this is a must read.
1400079179|3.0|On a vacation I took last year, I noticed that half the crowd was reading one Dan Brown book or another, so I decided to get on board by reading \\"Angels and Demons\\" followed by the \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" which both chronicle the adventures of Robert Langdon, part Harvard Professor symbologist (with a sub-specialty in secret societies), and part Indiana Jones. The beautiful, lithe and brilliant Vittoria of \\"Angels\\" is now replaced by the equally beautiful, lithe and brilliant Sophie Neveu, top-rate French criminologist. The books both follow the same basic formula: plenty of cliff-hangers, good guys who are really bad, and suspicious ornery guys who are really good.<br /><br />In short, in \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" an albino monk, a member of Opus Dei -- a secret Catholic offshoot where the leaders flog themselves and wear barbed wire anklets (I realize there's more to it than that)-- has been ordered by the \\"Teacher\\" to murder the top members of the Priory of Scion, another secret society, which alone holds the key to the real history of Jesus' life and early Christianity. Its military branch, Knights Templar, now long defunct, has hidden the Holy Grail, which is not a chalice (or cup of any sort) but rather secret documents revealing the importance of Mary Magdalene in the Jesus story. Before he is murdered, The most important member of the Priory, Jacques Sauniere (Sophie's grandfather who raised her after the death of her parents) leaves clues for Sophie and Robert to find the Grail, so that the \\"true\\" story of Jesus might not be lost. Some of these clues are revealed in the greatest works of Leonardo Da Vinci, who himself was once the top dog of the Priory (hence the title of the book). Sophie hasn't spoken to her poor grandfather in years, after she observed him taking part in a Paganistic ritual, symbolically \\"joining\\" Father and Mother Earth. Other, more thinly drawn characters also figure into the plot. As in \\"Angels,\\" the chapters are short, most ending in a cliff-hanger or a surprising revelation. Pages are turned quickly as the reader races to reach a resolution. I guessed the identity of the Teacher early on, not because I'm particularly insightful, but because I think I understand how Brown creates plot (actually, later in the book, I changed my mind about the Teacher's identity, having been misled by the private thoughts of a character who actually knew who he was, which I felt was somewhat dishonest on the author's part).<br /><br />Dan Brown is a fairly proficient thriller writer. What makes him so popular, I believe, is that he tackles big and provocative issues such as the \\"true\\" life and teachings of Jesus, the nature of the Vatican and Catholicism, and world-wide conspiracies led by super secret societies. Just from browsing the other day in a book store, I think it's obvious that other writers will now attempt to copy Brown by dealing with these subjects as well.<br /><br />In conducting some research on some of the claims in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" I learned that Brown often relies on questionable unscholarly sources. For instance, although most scholars agree that the figure to the immediate right of Jesus in Da Vinci's \\"Last Supper\\" is the Apostle John, Brown claims it's definitely Mary Magdalene, relying on sources who come up with their \\"theories\\" largely on pure speculation. It's certainly interesting, but what is it really based on? At one point, the book claims that, in a three hundred year period, the Catholic Church put to death five million women, by burning them at the stake, for being guilty of one kind of heresy or another. Shouldn't a highly disturbing and controversial claim like this be thoroughly documented? It's my understanding that this number is probably wildly inflated (although, for certain, any number is unacceptable).<br /><br />As a non-Christian, I agree with Brown's assessment that there seems to be a profound disconnect between the teachings of Jesus according to the New Testament (i.e.anti-accumulation of wealth, forgive the sinner, turn the other cheek) as compared with the later practices of the Catholic Church, especially during Medieval times. Brown's overall theme seems to be that women were considered far more important in early Christianity (as influence by Paganism) which later developed into a male-dominated religion that subjugated women. However, many cultures and religions throughout history have, unfortunately, subjugated women, including various forms of \\"Paganism.\\"<br /><br />In the end, I appreciate that \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" has made me think about these issues. The problem is the slew of books that have, and will continue to follow by less talented writers who re-interpret some major religion or piece of history without any factual basis, or claim some massive conspiracy by some secret society that has little influence in the real world.ament (i.e. anti-accumulation of wealth, forgive the sinner, turn the other cheek) as compared with the later practices of the Catholic Church, especially during Medieval times.

B00080ZG10|5.0|I love old Hollywood, and I wholeheartedly embrace films that come along tackling that golden time. It just makes it better that this film is about one of the most interesting Americans of the last several decades, made by one of the best, and frustratingly Oscar-less, directors of our time. Of course, I am talking about Howard Hughes and Martin Scorsese. Leonardo DiCaprio, in a deservingly Oscar nominated role, brings to life the enigma that is Houston oil tycoon, Howard Hughes. Taking place over a span of twenty years, from the late 1920's to the late 1940's, DiCaprio brings to fruition every aspect of the twenty year timeframe of this man's life to full bloom realization. Tycoon, Film producer, Aviation pioneer, legendary Hollywood playboy, Hughes lived many lives in his one. Starting off with his prodcution of \\"Hell's Angels\\", to his involvement in Aviation, to his romances with Katherine Hepburn(the fantastic Cate Blanchett), and the beautiful Ava Gardner(played by the equally beuatiful Kate Beckinsale), this film, at nearly 3 hours long, covers a lot of ground. Howard also had OCD(Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), and because it was undiagnosed at the time, had Howard living in his own private oblivion. This didn't stop him from battling Pan Am's Juan Trippe(the engaging Alec Baldwin), or Senator Ralp Brewster(the superb Alan Alda)from Maine. DiCaprio was fantastic in the role. He had the build and speech, and much later in the years, look down. While he sometimes looks like he's still a prepubescent teen, he nailed the part. Blanchett was incredible. While her accent came and went a little here and there, she was nevertheless incredible. She has 'ol Kate down to a tee, and she commandeered every scene she was in. Alda was equally fantastic as the slimey Senator Brewster. His casting was brilliant. Alda has the reputation of being the cleanest, nicest guy, and that is what made the casting all the more brilliant. He is a really nice guy, but he's also a really good actor, and he is fantastic. The movie also includes a number of appearances from other performers including John C. Reilly, Willem Dafoe, Jude Law, Edward Herrmann, The Wainwright's(Loudon, Rufus, Martha), and pop singer Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow. While the movie, which is beautifully constructed and written, doesn't delve into the last several years of Hughes' life as a recluse in a Las Vegas suite, it's almost better that way. The years it covers, which also touches on enough of Hughes' OCD, is what is most interesting. Not seeing the withered old man who blocked himself away from the world. It was better to leave it when it did. The score is beautiful, and the recreations of the times the timespan covers is impecable. Scorsese is one of the greatest directors, and he has delivered a Hollywood masterpiece that deserved the attention it got.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Well, it's taken me awhile to write this review because I really needed time to absorb the new material. SOAD has experimented a bit with their sound for this album, to slightly mixed results. Don't get me wrong, this is good stuff and I have tremendous respect for any band smart enough and brave enough to keep pushing their sound, but a few small points are minor letdowns for me. (Which I will now go to disproportionately great lengths to discuss...) <br /> <br />First, while I think it's great that the guitar player is getting more of a chance to sing and write lyrics, I think it might have been best if he'd been held back just a little. His singing is good, but his lyrics don't really grab me the way Serj's do. With all the serious things happening in the world right now, do we really need two songs in a row about the shallowness of Hollywood? Also, I think they need time to grow into the whole two-singer thing. So much of what Serj does that I love seems to be missing. <br /> <br />Second, in the time since Toxicity came out, my expectations for this cd grew far too large for anyone to live up to. They didn't help much, though, by talking up the whole \\"double album\\" thing, only to put out a scrawny 36 min cd. With their previous cd's clocking in around 45 min, I was looking forward to a 90 min double cd. If part 2 is the same length, then all of it would easily fit onto one cd - not a double album in my book. <br /> <br />Lastly, and this really just relates to the first, I was a little disappointed with the harmonies on this cd. Steal This Album did such a great job of expanding on the use of harmonies, and I was really looking forward to hearing them take off on the whole idea. They do expand on it, but it seems less focused somehow, without as much of a punch as I was hoping for. <br /> <br />OK, moving on to the positive. This is still an amazing cd once it grows on you. At first, there seems to be a lack of crushing musical brutality, but it's there. The album starts off strong and pretty well stays that way up to Violent Pornography, which still hasn't quite won me over yet, with it's rather obvious and repetitive lyrics. The album moves on from there to incorporate a few welcome \\"soft\\" parts and ends strongly with Lost in Hollywood, which could easily make it as a single along with Revenga (best harmonies on the cd), or my personal fave, Statue. <br />
B00097A5I6|5.0|I highly recommend this album. This isn't as good as their first three albums (Definitely Maybe, Morning Glory, Be Here Now), but much better than their last two (SOTSOG, Heathen Chemistry). Oasis fans - this is not another disappointment. You'll love it.
B00097A5I6|4.0|Oasis have come a long way.  <br /> <br />Since 1994, the two Gallagher brothers, Liam and Noel, along with three other members who have been replaced over the past 5 years have gone through instant rise to stardom, a quick blow to a tour that could have cemented their star status in America, inner fueding, at least one lousy album, broken marriages, and children. Despite all this mess, Oasis have never failed of delivering pure rock n roll music in the form of delightfully catchy and tuneful songs.  <br /> <br />Don't Believe The Truth is the band's 6th studio recorded album. Let me just open up by saying it's way better than Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants, their 2000 album that over time has become my, hands down, least favorite Oasis outing. Whether the album re-establishes Oasis as a major player in mainstream rock in America or not, Don't Believe The Truth is a satisfying Oasis release.  <br /> <br />Noel Gallagher, Oasis' typical songwriter, takes passenger seat this time around with the other members taking turns at the wheel. Liam sparks with three above average songs, the first of which is Love Like A Bomb, a Lennon-esque rocker ballad, a quite amazing tune with simple lyrics just like Songbird from 2002's Heathen Chemistry. Guess God Thinks I'm Able is another delicate accoustic Beatles-esque tune with lines like \\"No one can break us, no one can take us\\", a subliminal and blunt message from Liam to brother Noel that their partnership is undisputed. Finally, Liam lets it all hang on The Meaning Of Soul, a song Noel describes as \\"Elvis on Red Bull\\". Whatever, the point is, Soul is an average fast tune that qualifies Liam as an able songwriter. The opening track Turn Up The Sun, a cool ballad written by former Ride guitarist bassist Andy Bell, a member who replaced Paul McGuigan in 1999, is a powerful rocker with a message about loving one another. Gem Archer, rhythm guitarist and replacement of Bonehead since 1999, offers A Bell Will Ring, a feel good rock number that, unfortunately, is at best only filler. Noel's creativity shines on Part Of The Queue, a mellow rock number with a northern feel, a song about life in the city, reminiscing Noel's past b-side contributions from the 90's. Another track worth a brag is the first single Lyla, another Noel song that after repeated listening will become quite catchy. Although very ambitious, Lyla lacks the fever that past songs like Roll With It had. The Importance Of Being Idle, a highly appreciated Noel number, is deliberately filled with some cool surfer rock style guitar hooks. I wouldn't be surprised if Quentin Tarantino borrows a sample from Idle in one of his future films. The highlight of the album, and one of my personal favorites, comes last on the album. Let There Be Love, written by Noel, features the first time both Noel and Liam share lead vocal duty since Acqueisce, a delightful song and I just love the way Noel enters the song with \\"Come on baby blue\\". Priceless!  <br /> <br />Track picks:  <br />  <br />Lyla  <br />Love Like A Bomb  <br />Guess God Thinks I'm Able  <br />Turn Up The Sun  <br />Let There Be Love <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />B+ <br /> <br />
B00005JLEU|5.0|\\"Spirited Away\\" is the film that first turned me on to the work of Hayao Miyazaki.  The first time I saw it was as a weekly arthouse feature at my local cinema, and I was blown away by the beautiful storyline, appealing characters, and sweeping animation and musical score.  At the time, I thought that Pixar had done a fantastic job with the dubbing. <br /> <br />A couple of years afterwards, I bought the DVD and watched the original Japanese version, and have never felt the same about the English dub.  While the vocal performances are quite good, the writing manages to muddle and stink up the original dialogue.  Sometimes the changes are subtle: \\"god\\" in the original becomes \\"spirit\\" in the dub (I admit to knowing no Japanese; perhaps the Japanese word is the same for both?).  Other times, it's more blatant.  Disney seems to have felt the need to dumb this film down (\\"Americanize\\" it, if you will) to the point where they added explanatory dialogue to fill in what in the original were great moments of silence.  Obviously I can't tell you what they are without disclosing spoilers, but some of the mysteries of the film are ruined by this \\"over-dubbing,\\" and more than one transition is destroyed by it. <br /> <br />Fortunately for us, we have DVD technology; and this particular release is excellent, in that it gives us the dubbed version in addition to the original Japanese with its own set of more literal subtitles.  These subtitles sometimes go too quickly, but this film is so beautiful that it bears repeated viewings anyway.  Highly recommended DVD release.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Are you A Coldplay fan? Well this album will not dissapoint! I found myself skeptical of this cd as \\"Parachutes\\" was really an emotinal Joyride for me. \\"A Rush Of Blood\\", although lacking a little, also did the trick for me. When I heard a new album was on the way I worried it would not compare to the first two at all....was I ever wrong. This album is equally addictive to the first two and has songs that will hook you in instantly. I could carry on about the feel good mood some of the more upbeat tracks put me in, or I could go into detail about how the few ballads on this cd pulled on my heart strings....but if you are a Coldplay fan and have experienced such feelings when listening to their previous cd's...do yourself a favor and pick this album up as quickly as possible, you won't be dissapointed!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I wasn't a big fan of the first album.  Actually, all I was familiar with was 'Chop Suey' and 'Toxicity' from the first album.  Since then I had heard cuts from the band that exemplified their politics (Steal this Album) which really turned me off to the band because they sounded like every other young college student who doesn't know a damn thing about society or reality.<br /><br />However, I have had the opportunity to listen to 'Mezmerize' and I find it extremely entertaining and touching a genre I have never known, but knew was out there.  These guys have a pretty friggin' good mixture of metallic riffs and punk energy (think of Slayer/NOFX).  Listen to 'Revenga', 'B.Y.O.B', 'This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm on this Song', actually listen to ALL of the songs.  Put the politics aside.<br /><br />Personally, I am quite conservative politically regardless of my musical taste.  However, who can't help to giggle at the lyrics to 'Cigaro'?  Listen to this album, you won't be disappointed...<br /><br />Great job with this album SOAD...
B00097A5I6|3.0|Oasis are like your long-standing girlfriend. The one whose changed so much since you met her. You still love her, but it's not because of who she is anymore, but who she was. From time to time flashes of the old Her run before your eyes, and you fall in love again, and as soon as they re-appear they are gone again, possibly forever. You may not want to admit it, but you know it's the truth. It's not my fault if you don't believe me.
0380733358|4.0|With the Memorial Day Holiday, I wanted to read a WWII novel, having started this practice with books like Black Cross by Greg Iles and The Unlikely Spy by Daniel Silva.  After reading the reviews I was sure I had made a good choice.  What I found was an above average novel that dragged in spots. <br />Percival Godliman is \\"recruited\\" to work for MI6 with the specific task of finding a German spy who has knowledge of the Allies D-Day plans.  While this is an exciting plot for a story, I found the book to pale in comparison when held up against the aforementioned novels and the author's own WWII book, Jackdaws.
B00003CX95|2.0|Mel Gibson seem to be a mesochist determined to impress the world with his willingness to protray himself suffering with make-believe valiance in some cheezy pretense of historical settings.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Most of the reviewers have covered everything I might have had to say.  This might not be the best SOAD album, but it's SOAD and they RULE.  At a time when Rock/Metal Music is at it's lowest they don't change, commercialize or go with the flow. NO, they're as original as they were 6 years ago.  I have the greatest respect for Bands like SOAD and Slayer and will continue to listen their good music for as long as they don't change.  I would also like to ask pop/rap/techno etc fans to stop downrating this Album.  It's only their fault, if they bought the Album by mistake and they have no right to give them a low rating.  It would be the same if I go and give a low rate to Mariah Carey's album now, just because I don't like her music and I bought the CD because I liked the cover.
B00097A5I6|4.0|Some reasons<br /><br />-the rediscovery of acoustic guitar over electric. Some of the best Oasis songs were their b-sides in the mid 90s which relied on this and this new album abounds with it, done well<br /><br />-the album has an integrity, the songs belong to each other, ie it feels like an album, not a collection of a songs. Heathen Chemistry failed on this count, Don't Believe the Truth succeeds<br /><br />-new things are tried, both new kinds of instrumentation, new ways of using Noel and Liam's voice, different ways of composing songs that don't easily fit into the formula that Oasis has been cast into. And yet the newness doesn't undercut the reasons so many have gotten into the band<br /><br />-As others have noted, Oasis has a history of bad lyrics, even in some of there finest songs (supersonic makes me laugh, gag that way) but this album has some great lines, decent lyrics, even a few insights which is a shock to me.<br /><br />For those who have been waiting for an Oasis album which would not disappoint, would captures something of what makes the group a solid band, this album is worth a buy.
0062502182|5.0|I have to admit that I was not particularly enthused about reading the book at first but the moment I picked it up, I was drawn into the story and I could not help but travel the journey with the main character.  To me, he represents a part of all of us - the part that dreams of pursuing the impossible, the part that gets forgotten and burried away as we get caught up in our daily, more practical routines. <br /> <br />This book does not have twisted plots to hold its reader's attention.  On the contrary, it captivates in its simplicity. It's like revisiting an old tale with new insights that we have gathered from our experiences in life.  It's like a gentle nudge from a friend, a wonderful reminder that if we have a purpose in life, it will make it that much more meaningful and that sometimes, it takes a long journey for us to appreciate what's closest to our hearts. <br />
B00005UQ9F|5.0|Session 9 is one of the most atmospheric horror films i've ever seen.  Having seen every \\"classic\\" horror film ever made, I can say that this film is easily as scary as several of those movies.  Session 9 has the perfect mixture of modern and traditional horror, and it works better than several horror films that are strictly contemporary (the WAY overated The Ring) or old fasioned (Halloween).   <br />The movie is about 5 guys being hired to clear out the Danvers Mental Hospital, an abandoned hospital that really exists and is considered haunted.  The film was shot on location at the asylum.  The workers are supposed to work on site for a week, and then recieve a 10,000 dollar bonus for their quick work (and as a reward for not rushing off in a hurry to leave the hospital).  On the first day of the excavation, one of the workers discovers a box labeled EVIDENCE.  Inside are a set of audio tapes that are audio \\"interviews\\" with an old patient at the hospital.  There are nine tapes, nine sessions.  Throughout the movie, we hear more and more of the tapes, and thus we learn more about the patient, Mary.  We learn she is a multi-personality schitzophrenic (she has 4 personalities), and that she is also violent, when the right personality is revealed.  Every scene with Mary (or Billy, or Princess, or Simon) is through audio, and they create a forboding atmosphere in themselves.  The tapes tie into the rest of the film at the very end, which is violent and unexpected. <br />***** of *****

B0006957SA|5.0|If you get only one Pogues album, let this be it.  I don't give out 5 starts lightly, but over the past couple decades I've come to believe this was one of the best albums of the late 80s.  Following \\"Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash\\", the Pogues took a break as they moved onto a major label.  During this interval, they added several members (including the considerably older Irish folk traditionalist Terry Woods) and grew into an 8-piece band.   <br /> <br />The results were astonishing.  Before, they sounded a bit sloppy--not the happy sort of sloppy that some punk bands embrace, but a work-in-progress sort of sloppy, the sound of a band that hadn't quite gelled yet.  Here, they were suddenly ON, a Irish folk band playing in a full Gaelic roar of sound.  Meanwhile, MacGowan had perfected his snarling brogue, managing to sound both intimidating (\\"Birmingham Six\\") and forelorn (\\"Fairytale of NY\\") as the songs demanded, but generally still intelligible.  The lyrics are sheer poetry and encapsulate the Irish experience as no other modern Irish singer has managed to do.   <br /> <br />Things went downhill from here, as MacGowan's drug and alcohol abuse took its toll.  They had some great songs before this album, and even after (see \\"White City\\"), but all of their other albums have some filler, even \\"Rum, Sodomy and the Lash.\\"  There is none here.  Everyone I have ever loaned this CD to has become a Pogues fan, even if they missed them first time around.  This is a must-have album.

You've made a fool of everyone. <br /> <br />Look What You've Done, by Jet: <br />Look what you've done, you've made a fool of everyone. <br /> <br />Not only does the song sound exactly like late Beatles music in its style and delivery - and Saxy Sadie in particular - it lifts lyrics almost verbatim.

I'm looking forward to the U.S. tour.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This album is great. These guys keep getting better. Buy it now!
B00097A5I6|5.0|I have never been an Oasis fan,sure I've heard their classic radio staples such as \\"Wonderwall\\" and \\"Supernova\\",but overall never really thought of myself as a devout fan of Oasis or any kind of alternative music.Then one day I hear a remake of \\"Street Fighting Man\\" on the radio-or so i thought!Turns out the song is called \\"Lyla\\" by a newly rejuvenated Oasis.I was hooked on the \\"Stones/Who\\" inspired song instantly.I got over the fact that the beginning sounded like the Stones but the song as a whole didn't really sound like a song Oasis would make.(keep in mind again,i'm only familiar with their really known songs)So on the first day I found myself asking someone at Music World where the new Oasis album was.I was really expecting to be dissappointed for some reason since I was only buying the album for one song.But after a day of listening to the album,I am really impressed.Now in terms of how this measures up their previous works,in particular their first 2 albums,many have said it is their best since \\"Morning Glory\\" from '95,but I wouldn't know.But as a new fan only hearing this album in entirety without hearing the others,this is a fantastic rootsy,brit-rock album.In terms of influences,I can defintely hear Beggar's Banquet with a little psychadelia thrown in for good measure.The only songs that take getting used to are probably Noel's songs since Oasis fans are probably more used to his take on the songs.But nevertheless,Noel's songs are just on par with the rest of the album.If I am going to have a complaint,I would have to say that \\"Meaning Of Soul\\" is a fantastic garage rocker,but ITS TOO SHORT!!Other than that,cheers to the Gallagher Bros and Co. on one hell of a rock record!    *Best Songs  Turn Up The Sun  Lyla  A Bell Will Ring  Let There Be Love  Mucky Fingers  Keep The Dream Alive  Love Like A Bomb
B00097DX3U|2.0|I loved their first album and expected great things from them. This album seems rushed. Not even guitarist Tom Morello can save this album. Save your money.
B00005JNTV|4.0|I saw this movie on opening day and was instantly blown away by it.   <br />The graphics in this movie (just like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, both of which being completely filmed against blue screens) make this movie quite fun to watch, and the black and white effect takes you deep into the gritty world of Basin City. Also, I must mention the absolutely brilliant narration. It introduces the characters and their situation very well, and served as a raw opener for each character. Miller has proved his worth writing the original comics, and does so yet again directing this movie. Rodriguez does another fine film, and receives (quite frankly, deserves) respect for sticking to the comics so well. Taratino again proves his curious love for blood in movies. For anyone who hasn't seen it, this movie is three stories. One is that of Marv, a man who falls deeply in love with a woman, only to see her killed on the same night. He goes off in search of the killer, murdering himself on the way. Then there's that of Hartigan, who only has one thing in life that matters, and that's the safety of skinny little Nancy Callahan. He's got to keep her safe; that's all that matters. Dwight, the 2nd to last story in the film, gets to witness the fall of the truce between Whoreland and Copville (those aren't the actual names, but that's pretty much what they are.) The order of these stories are - 1\2 of Hartigan, Marv, Dwight, & other 1\2 of Hartigan. Before I leave off, I'll give you a warning. This movie is incredibly violent, and if you're easily phased by blood and gore, stay away. (For example - a guy gets an axe in the head, another guy gets a swistka-shaped bladeon his eyebrow, another guy gets all four of his limbs cut off, etc., etc...) Like the title of my review suggests, this film is great for any noir fan, but you definately can't be of the faint of heart, or stomach for that matter. Happy viewing, ZM2K

B00097A5I6|4.0|As a great fan of Oasis, I was looking forward to the new Oasis album Don't Believe The Truth. The band, after 10 years since the brilliant What's the Story, Morning Glory have made their new album to share to the world. Now I'll start off by saying it isn't as good as WTSMG, but that's because WTSMG had the one hit wonder, classic \\"Wonderwall.\\" But that doesn't mean it's not worth buying. The band still retains their beautiful guitar riffs, lyrics and singing quality. After more than 10 years in the music business Liam still manages to have a superb singing voice. <br />1) Turn Up The Sun (3.59) - A really mellow, sleepy introduction, then builds up into their customary acoustic rock. A strong, slow but angry song, great for a beginning song. It ends slowly, instrumentally <br />2) Mucky Fingers (3.56) - A personal best, where I think Noel is singing. A friendly fast paced song. Quite simple as chords and music go, but the frantic action of the guitar makes up for it. It's quite a bluesy/country type song <br />3) Lyla (5.10) - Well everyone knows Lyla, which takes some getting used to, but is a really good song. Liam's voice may be a tad whiny in the first voice, but the strumming of the guitar makes up for it. Around the 2.50 mark there is a really expert guitar sound, played very expertly. You can tell a lot of work has gone into this <br />4) Love Like A Bomb (2.52) - A slow song, where a piano is played very beautifully in it. If you want comparisons, then it sound rather like a Travis song <br />5) The Importance of Being Idle (3.39) - Another bluesy type song, where the music gradually builds up starting from the guitar and bass, to the beat. Noel sings in this; in a quite high voice, but really good neverless. An off-beat country song <br />6) The Meaning of Soul (1.42) - WHAT?! ONE MINUTE FOURTY-TWO SECONDS you ask?! Yes, the sorry truth is that this song is very short. Shame on you Oasis! What happened to the usual long songs? It's not such a bad song though, a bit too bluesy in my opinion <br />7) Guess God Think's I'm Abel (3.24) - A very, slow sad song practically like a funeral song. It doesn't really build up, until the very very last 5 seconds, which is a tad pointless. Simplistic strumming of the guitar. More like a filler song <br />8) Part of the Queue (3.48) - Heavy Strumming where Noel sings once again. A loud-ish song all the way through <br />9) Keep the Dream Alive (5.45)- A beautiful, gentler song, one of my favourites, because Liam sings with such passion in the song. One of those beautiful/sad songs, it certainly should be another single. Sounds a lot like an 'original' Oasis song <br />10) A Bell Will Ring (3.07) - A simple yet jolly bluesy song. A bit of a filler track but still pretty good <br />11) Let there be Love (5.31) - Possibly the most dead song in the album, destined to put you to sleep. I do not like this track at all. And it's a whole 5-and-a-half minute song as well! Liam's voice sorts of drone, and the instrument kind of drags on a bit <br />12) I can see it now (4.06) - Another strng guitar introduction, and a great beat through start to finish. Why this is number 12 is beyond me! However you can barely hear the words \\"I can see it now\\" due to the heavy pounding music. The violin is played very well in this, reminding me of The Verve. If you like The Verve, you'll like this song <br />13) Sitting Here In Slience (On My Own)(2.00) - Instead of a nice strong ending, Sitting Here In Silence, is a dying song, that eventually fades out. Instruments include a weak drum beat, and a piano, then bells towards the end. <br />Overall, this album is very good, not the usual Oasis style, because it is almost country. Also Noel sings a lot more than usual. Still a good buy for you fans.
B0008KLVG4|4.0|From the sound of it, the 2 hour \\"making of\\" documentary on this disc is the same as the one included in the 1995 Collector's Edition LaserDisc box set.  The documentary is fantastic and worth every penny on DVD (please don't ask me how much I paid for the LaserDisc box set -- it was horrifically expensive compared to DVD prices).<br /><br />The 25th Anniversary \\"Jaws\\" DVD had about half of that documentary, and I was plenty peeved that they short-changed us.  Finally, we get the whole thing (I'm being led to believe).<br /><br />The 30th Anniversary edition is worth buying for the full-length documentary if you are a fan of filmmaking and a die-hard \\"Jaws\\" fan.  If you are just a casual \\"Jaws\\" fan and already own a DVD copy, then at least consider splurging on the 30th Anniversary edition as a gift to yourself -- you will probably be pleasantly entertained and fascinated by this documentary.
B0007VNGX0|3.0|This 2004 horror/action sequel from Sony is among the first titles to be ported to the PSP UMD video format.  Starring the lovely Milla Jovovich, RE:A is loosely based on the video game series from Capcom.    The Movie <spoiler alert!>    Let's just be honest here: when you're dealing with a movie based on a B-genre video game title you are asking for trouble.  The fact that said movie is a sequel further exacerbates the problem.  Now, the first RE movie was actually a  moderate success.  Beautiful Milla was a likeable heroine and the plot was servicable, if full of blatant rip-offs from a host of better sci-fi/horror flicks.  Still, the movie was well-paced, and had a killer opening sequence.  There was a fair balance of action, horror, and science fiction throughout.    RE:Apocolypse, by contrast, is a more straight forward action film that suffers as a result of it's own failed expectations.  The story basically centers around how the shadowy, uber-corporation, Umbrella, ends up pitting their two greatest genetic warriors, Alice and Nemesis (her now mutated beyond recognition old partner/lover), against each other.  The whole middle of the movie is simply filler to allow a couple of characters from the game series (Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera, played by Sienna Guillory and Oded Fehr respectively) to make an appearance and provide a plot device to segue to a possible third sequel.    Granted you can't expect too much from a movie like this, but my biggest gripe by far is the very lame guy-in-a-rubber suit fight at the end.  Director Alexander Witt tries his best to hide this really really really bad attempt at a \\"Big Boss Battle\\" between Alice and Nemesis with very close-up, choppy camera work, and quick-cut edits, but it's pretty obvious that they needed a budget for digital effects that they did not end up getting.    Overall, this movie is at least half-way entertaining, especially if you're a fan of Milla as she is quite the ass-kicker.  Jovovich is quoted as being a fan of the game, and it's to her credit that she takes this role seriously enough to lend it some credibility despite the tacky premise and uninspired, contrived scripting.    The Video    Pretty close to what you would find on DVD.  There is some bleeding/saturation of dark scenes that you would expect from the LCD screen, but overall it's nothing that only a real videophile would get riled over.    The Sound    Dialog is soft, but the general sound field and effects are well done.  For example, helicopter rotors moving across the screen have the appropriate effect on the headphones.  Nice.    Special Features    There are none.    Summary    Despite it's many flaws, RE:A is really the kind of movie the PSP is going to be concentrating on for now: relatively short, action-oriented films with cheap thrills.  Taken for what it is, it is more of a \\"guilty pleasure\\" than anything else.    I can't really recommend it, but being a Milla softie I enjoyed it.
B00097A5I6|3.0|I probably am not the first to make this analogy in a review of the new Oasis album, but I think it's appropriate:  the new \\"Star Wars\\" movie is getting good reviews not because it's such a wonderful film, but because the last two have sucked so bad that anything better than horrible is enhanced by comparison.  I think that this is exactly how everyone has been psyched down in anticipation of \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\".  The first two Oasis l.p.'s are as great an opening salvo as anyone has come out with in the history of rock.  They are truly awesome.  Their third, \\"Be Here Now\\", was a disappointment at the time it was released, but play it now and see how much better it is than, say, \\"Standing In The Shadow Of Giants\\". . .or, for that matter, \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\".  There are plenty of reviews to read here, so I won't drag on, but be warned:  NONE of the best songs on this record are by Noel Gallagher.  Andy Bell and Gem Archer contributed what are easily the best tracks on here---all three are excellent---and, oddly enough, they sound like the songs where the most effort was put forth as far as \\"production\\" is concerned, as well.  Noel's are average (which means \\"poor\\", by his standards) and Liam's?  Well, his lyrics are still awful and his melodies are not really worthy of comment.  This is not a bad album, but it sure isn't what we've been hoping for.  Honestly.
B00003CXCT|5.0|OK, people who keep whining about the changes made, get over it! These are the films. You complained for years for Star Wars to be released on DVD, you finally got it. Changes were made, accept it. The changes are minor and actually provide better continuity (Boba Fett having the same voice as Jango, Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine). If Goerge added the Biggs, Windy, Fixer scene back in, would you all complain because that's not the \\"original?\\" No, you wouldn't, and you all know it. <br /> <br />5 stars, all the way. Not a flaw to be found (well, OK, Jabba still doesn't look right in A New Hope, but oh well).
B0007GAEW6|5.0|...<BR>Frances the Mute = Wow x 10^Wow<br />Finally, a band that bends the rules for what songs can be. There was no corporate producer telling them how their music had to sound. The band had total freedom to craft their songs, and how refreshing it is to hear it. Make no mistake, this is just good old rock and roll, but not the predictable carbon-copy retread that you hear on the radio - it's music that's been given the freedom to be what it can be - what corporate labels have stiffled - and what your ears are dying to hear.
B00097A5I6|5.0|This is Oasis' best album since Definitely Maybe in 1994, it's just like nothing I've ever heard. I mean, I love every song on this, and that has never been the case with an Oasis album. I love The Importance of Being Idle and Part of the Queue, Noel Gallagher really outdid himself on those. Although, the one's that Liam wrote are good as well. Hell, even the one's Andy Bell and Gem Archer wrote are good. The point is, the entire album is good. Fast-forwarding through tracks isn't an option, because every single one is good. The music is the best it's been in a long while, and the lyrics are more coherent. Musically, this album is simple and very Velvet Underground, but you can also trace some Bob Dylan there, especially on Mucky Fingers. Turn Up the Sun has all the potential to be the next single, and the Meaning of Soul is awesome as well. Let There be Love is the kind of song that would be great to close their set with at some festival, such as Glastonbury, it would set the mood perfectly. Even old Oasis fans won't be dissapointed with this one, it's different, but it's a damn good kind of different.
B00003CXDB|4.0|Oliver Stone has made his second best movie after JFK, in my opinion with this powerful portrait of greeed and power in the middle of the financial capital of the world.<br />Gekko is typical character of those ages. It is not a bad guy, he just follows the rules, bets and wins, so what is the point with that?<br />The newcomer, Charlie Sheen is an idealist young man and his epci consists in twist the fate of this ambitious man who thinks he can move all the chess pieces without any risk.<br />There is just one complaint of my own. Stone seems just to wash the face to the system he attacks, and somehow this restrained gaze weakens the structure of the script. The good customes and the honesty finally win the game but how long can you smile with this bizarre triumph? and even worst are you sure you can talk about ethics in such atmosphere. Wall Street means risk and failure, competence and disloyalty, no rules just basic instinct if you want to survive.<br />There are many common places between this film and Donnie Brasco if you think it carefully. It is the figure of the experience against the youth idealism, but remember Hobbes and forget the innocence in the world. You may become as the central figure of Candide's Voltaire if you think the world is composed bu good and bad boys: the question is survive; no matter how high is the prize you pay by that.<br />Michael Douglas made the best achievement of his career to date. A kinetic script and glorious camera work.
B0009A40ES|3.0|Mainly reflects, in the most satiric way of course, the lifestyle of the cynical and cearless wallstreet businessculture. It brutally critizises materialism in our society. This is a pretty violent film and many people haven`t been able to see throught all the gore in what`s the film really about. It`s not anykind of serialkiller thriller.   It's still not perfectly directed and the kind of novel adaption it most likely could`ve been. Anyway, Christian Bale fits quite perfectly in his role of the superfical caricature of a  businessperson.     -\\"american ding-dong\\"
B000002AP1|5.0|This is the greatest rock n roll album ever made. Period. If you don't own this you don't own anything.    NOTE: I am reviewing the album, not whether the remix is good or bad. Like most people here I prefer the original bad mix to this bad remix. But there's only so much you can do. It is what it is an as artifact, but as a performance it's unbeatable.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|It's nice to have System Of A Down around. Especially now. Amidst all the absymal pop-rap, whiny emo, and boring Creed-like pseudo-grunge dominating the charts, it's a breath of fresh air to have Mezmerize hit the shelves, showing the SOAD boys have not slowed down a bit, still just as crazy and loud as ever! <br /> <br />In their latest installment (a part two is coming out this fall), SOAD tackles politics (B.Y.O.B., Sad Statue), the shallowness of Hollywood (Old School Hollywood, Lost In Hollywood), TV (Violent Pornography), and, oddly enough, male endowment (Cigaro, my personal favorite). My personal favorites are B.Y.O.B, Cigaro, This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song, Violent Pornography, and Lost In Hollywood, but there are no bad songs, and the album has a great flow about it. The songs are often loud, hard, and nuts, or they're actually good ballads. Just like their previous efforts, at times you question Serj Tankian's sanity, but at the same time, the album is full of hooks. <br /> <br />If you aren't into SOAD, this album won't convert you. But this is easily a must-have for SOAD fans. <br /> <br />My name is Eggplant and I approved that review.
1573225517|4.0|One of those Peter Pan tales, the protagonist Rob has just been dumped by his girlfriend Laura, a breakup he considers for his Top Five, but then ultimately rejects. It still hurts plenty, though, which makes for very amusing sulking, chats with his two (very socially retarded) record store employees, lists, and humiliating phone calls and encounters with the New Flame.  <br /> <br />More hilarity comes when he phones the girlfriends from previous breakups and finds that in most cases, they have entirely different memories (or may not remember it much at all.)  <br /> <br />Finally, when Laura's dad dies, Rob is forced to come to terms with his feelings for her. A breezy read, \\"High Fidelity\\" offers plenty of humor for the rock music fanatic (although references are often English) and entertainment for even the non-fanatical reader. <br />
B00097A5I6|5.0|Oasis are not back in form, they never truly lost it.  They have to be seen as an evolving band, with six very unique studio albums, and close to six more albums worth of top notch B-sides.  Simply put, they are THE modern day music machine, and the true reincarnations of guitar rock bands of the past.   <br /> <br />'Don't Believe the Truth' does not necessarily break massive, new ground, but the maturity of the Brothers Gallagher and whoever else is playing music with them show.  Gem and Andy Bell are great musicians and they contribute three tracks between them, as the songwriting duties are now being shared among all members.  Anthems have been replaced by concise music and it's certainly different from the other albums in that sense.  With all that said, I'll cut this review short. Either you will definitely buy this album, or you won't, and that's the beauty of Oasis - the loyalty from the true fans.   <br /> <br />Standout tracks: <br />Lyla (fantastic drums), The Importance of Being Idle (everyone can relate to it), Keep the Dream Alive (highly underrated, written by Andy Bell, best lyrics on the album), and the closer Let There Be Love, which was previously a demo, and has been reworked in the last five years to near perfection. <br /> <br />Note: Definitely purchase the DUAL DISC.  It includes a two-sided CD with the album on one side, and a DVD enhanced album on the other side with a documentary and the Lyla video.  The bonus CD is a live CD from 1995 with five classics on it.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Needless to say, this movie is just what I want.  I just finished watching it on DVD.  I felt that the DVD has given me a clear visual effect of watching it.  Leonardo rocks all the way in this movie, as well as Cate.  Well done!!
B0002OERI0|3.0|it was good.......for a few times through.  this cd and these songs grow old fast. green day's attempt at being political and making a pop/punk opera sucks.  old GD was amazing. singing about drugs, masturbation, and a bunch of crap like that......and now this?! look i understand they no longer smoke and billie joe actually has kids (i think), so they should just quit, or only do live stuff.  theyre still good musicians, they just made a bad decision......a terrible decision.  Green Day- stick to your old stuff, or dont make music at all.
B00097A5I6|5.0|Yeah! The summer can begin!  Great album, not one bad song, great guitar work, Oasis has outdone themselves. Feels like a real band album.  Fans certainly couldn't be dissapointed, and now is the time for anyone who has resisted Oasis to give in. Have listened 3 times all the way through and love it.
B000066NW0|1.0|she should kill herself, or get her boyfriend/girlfriend to kill her. she sucks at acting like she's making music. just a canadian ashlee simpson with a guitar and trying to be punk. <br />oh wait, kurt cobain made good music.....avril didnt/doesnt. <br /> <br />seriously though, i'd be happy if she died (and i know i'm not alone on that).
B0006A9IVQ|5.0|Simply wonderful movie. Together with Marcello Mastroianni she played her role in a great way. Highly suggested if you love Sofia
B00000DHRZ|5.0|This CD is probably one of the best I've heard every song is excellent and is done in a way to really get you excited I highly recommend this to anyone one who are fans of punk rock. If you buy it you'll love it.
B000069AUI|5.0|I have had this CD in my computer at work for three years! Most CDs don't last a week. I get bored of them and take them home again. I love every song on this CD--yes, the singles have been played out. \\"In my Place\\" and \\"Clocks\\" are the most familiar. But the treasures on this album, for me, really are \\"Warning Sign\\", the title song and \\"Amsterdam.\\" Three songs I cannot live without, hence, if I were stuck on a deserted island, this is the CD I would want with me.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I was a stranger to Radiohead when I purchased Ok Computer, and upon playing it the first time I skipped through the songs and put it up for months. Not very impressed. I then learned that it was nominated for a Best Album grammy so I dug it up and gave it another chance. That was the same day I was born. I have always been a huge fan of Indie rock. My musical taste was and is always against the grain somewhat. This album changed the entire was I looked at music. I blossomed into something completely different. These lyrics, these melodies, and these songs do so much for me as a music fan. I have experienced this album so many times, and still it hits me as it did the second time. I feel privledged to be a huge fan of Radiohead now. And never want to think about what my music collection would look like had I never picked this album up. Kudos to Thom and Co. for creating something that can actually change lives.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|The two hour making of documentary is worthy of release on its own.  The previous edition had an hour of it and even though I wish they would have included it all; I'll get this since I would buy the documentary by itself.  Probably the best feature ever on the making of a film.
B00097A5I6|4.0|how do they get that sound of a guitar?  it has to be an SG played through an AC30 or similar <br /> <br />someone give us the dope <br /> <br />great album
6303367518|4.0|Meryl Streep plays a woman who takes her family white water rafting in an attempt to revive their disintegrating relationships .Thr trip goes well at first but events take a darker turn when they encounter armed robbers -played by Kevin Bacon and John C Reilly -who commandeer their raft and seek to make away with their haul ,a substantial  $ 250,000 .As her husband (David Strathairn) wimps out it is Streep who has to step up and lead the battle against the bad guys . <br />This is a terrific white knuckle ride ,the striking rural scenery making a change from the urban mean streets of most thrillers and the action scenes are well executed by director Curtis Hanson .Bacon and Reilly are excellent as is Strathairn but the real revelation is Streep here thoroughly convincing as a strong willed wife and mother fighting physically and emotionally for her family  .She has alsways previously struck me as a technically gifted but rather distant performer but she eschews the usual accents and mannerisms to give a persuasive peformance . <br />While action full the movie is not unduly violent and I recommned it enormously
B000062YAZ|5.0|You should be ashamed if you need to be told how good this album is, it is the most agressive, breakthrough, album ever. Not alot of good metal anymore like this, few true new metal bands left like this one, Majur Bludd has become my recent favorite.
B000002H33|5.0|Most definitive of their catalog by far, they lost alot of writing ability after Cliff died and have never been this good since(live or studio). Not too many true metal bands left, check out Majur Bludd live if you like real metal like this.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|I really don't get the referances to Television or the Velvet Underground, they (Strokes) just sound a bit juvenile to me aiming to appeal to the american eagle crowd. Jet and Franz Ferdinad are a better buy. Most of the album is filler, except the track that sounds like a Cars rip off.
B000007T1M|5.0|this is the best SOAD cd they ever made! if you think different you need to be beaten w/ a shovel.
B00004XOWM|1.0|JESUS CHRIST THIS IS AN AWFULL CD!i give them credit for \\"$3 bill yall\\" it was ok but im still not a huge fan of that cd, i dont even own it. but this is a sad excuse for music, music is suposed to be a form of art but this is just a form of sh*t! even when everyone was listening to them in the '90s i hated them. i dont see how they even got popular! this is unlisten able, i would rather be violently tourtued by a nazi on meth during world war 2 then listening to this cd! its just that awfull. first boy-bands then this load of rat ass, god what is this country coming to.....
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|a great cd dont get me wrong but SOAD could have came up w/ a WAY better cd. it was way to short like 32min. but hey \\"hypnotise\\" is coming out so im looking forward to it. i still suggest this cd its great! but if you want some real awesome SOAD get their self titled 1st cd!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Excellent TV show!  The Eagles are the best!  This was very enjoyable and I look forward to having a copy of the DVD.  They have been my favorite group since the beginning of their career.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I just started learning about greenday now i listen to there whole CD every day!
B00007GZR5|3.0|We owned this movie for a while. It was one of those that had a special meaning for us, so we held on to it, until we decided to watch again. It must have been three or four years since we had last seen it. I was fascinated with the extraordinary art design once more: the concept of immersing yourself in a world painted by you after you die, actually dipping your feet in waters of paint, etc. was breathtaking with all the impressionist-like strokes on the screen.<br /><br />The concept of the script as a whole is also fantastic: the struggle of a husband to recuperate his wife who committed suicide, after he finally \\"runs\\" into his (also) dead children in heaven. But the development of the story gets worse as the movie evolves. Towards the end, I was wondering what was I thinking when I first saw it. It leaves you with a flavor of a movie that could have been so much, yet fell terribly short. I cannot, therefore, give it more than three stars in all fairness.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I was suprised by this album. It was a hell of alot better than toxicity. My Favorite songs on the album is B.Y.O.B, Radio/Video, Revengea, Question!, Old School Hollywood, and Lost In Hollywood. Overall it is an awsome cd. I recommed all of u that hate System Of A Down to go out and purches this CD. <br /> <br />-The Cd/Movie Guy
B0007GAERG|5.0|I have never been a huge fan of MC but this album is off the hook!  All the tracks are lively and will have you clapping your hands and singing along! She is definitely finding her own style and you can feel her emancipation!
B00097A5I6|2.0|The thing I have always loved about Oasis is the big wall of sound evedent in their early albums.  It was raw energy.  Unfortunately they started losing the \\"wall of sound\\" on Heather Chemistry, and it is completely gone on this offering.  This is their weakest, most uninspired album to date.  My copy came with an extra disc that contains live tracks recorded in '95.  Listening to the two, there is no comparison.  The energy has left the band.  Too bad...
0060723513|5.0|Such a good book!  Easy, fast read with lots of great messages to get you thinking and pondering.  I enjoyed this thoroughly.
0714843377|4.0|The bold typeface and tongue-in-cheek title caught my eye when I was in a bookstore, and my curiosity was piqued.  I've had this book for over a year, and it's traveled all over with me.  This book is meant to jumpstart your creativity by getting you to think outside of the box, no matter your field.  Even though I've no footing in the world of advertising, I still find Paul Arden's ideas creative, irrelevant enough so that they just might work, and witty at the same time.  Honestly, I think the fact that his thoughts are set within the world of advertising help in and of themselves; there is already that existing context by which one can compare his or her own personal situation.  Furthermore, I enjoyed the British humor embibed within: self-deprecating and fun, but also serious.  The images are what sold me; they really drive home the point he's trying to make in each of the sections.  I've browsed many inspirational-type books before, and among the things that have always irritated me (as a potential reader) have been their general vagueness and their superfluous religious references (and this is secular literature!).  This book has inspired me to be more assertive with my thoughts and actions, and to consider the positive in every situation.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is hard, heavy progressive metal at its very best lyrically and musically. Dream Theater's heaviest album shows extraordinary musicianship and skill. Of course there are plenty of jaw dropping guitar solos and yes the amazing drumming of Mike Portnoy. John Petrucci, Mike Portnoy, Jordan Rudess, and bassist John Myung effectively peeled back the pretentious excesses of Six Degrees, turned them in on themselves, and came up with a leaner, meaner but no less ambitious outing. An incredible listen all the way through. Best track would be \\"This Dying Soul: IV. Reflections of Reality.\\" A must have for DT fans.
0141301155|5.0|Mr. Dahl had a great imagination, an odd (if somewhat jaundaced) way of looking at things, and a fantastic command of the English language.  I don't know if \\"Charlie\\" or any of his other books have been translated, but I would imagine that it would be difficult to do so. <br /> <br />To the reviewers who were horrified at the fates of the children--that is the point.  They were horrid little brats who got their comeuppances.  In every case they were warned NOT to do something and they did it--and look what happened to them.  Mr. Wonka assures us that they come out OK, although not unchanged. (Violet will probably be blue to the end of her days, for example.) Yet, one is sure that they will have learned from the experience.  Mike surely won't watch nearly so much television, and Veruca certainly won't be nearly so spoilt.  Children aren't nearly as delicate as some parents think they are, and aren't (usually)traumatized by such stories, unless they are unusually sensitive; and in a world that contains things like Abu Ghraib, Kosovo, and the Sudan, the sooner they get toughened up a bit the better. <br /> <br />To the reviewer who didn't like the fact that two of the brats were GIRLS and was afraid that the story would bruise her precious little one's delicate female self-esteem, I'd recommend MATILDA by the same author. (Actually, as a former schoolteacher, my experience with girls is that many of them have too MUCH self-esteem; so many adolescent and pre-adolescent girls seem to think that they rank at least as countesses, and expect to be treated as such.)
B000003TAB|5.0|Before I begin to review this CD, I feel forced to ask a question; why review albums that you hate?  I just spent like 15 minutes reading reviews about how people hate Nirvana and their \\"sloppy music\\" and such...if you don't like something why 1) spend your energy writing about something you hate and 2) cursing the world with your negativity when we certainly neither asked for nor require it.   <br /> <br />For most bands releasing a collection of b-sides and demos on the heels of a ground-breaking album would be a career-ender.  Lucky for us Kurt Cobain didn't care, because this is maybe the best example of what Nirvana was about.  Some are fast (Mexican Seafood) some are slow (Big Long Now) and some are freakishly brilliant (Aneurysm).  I don't know how anyone could be a \\"casual\\" Nirvana fan, so if you like any Nirvana songs get this cause you'll like this too.  And they think this guy killed himself?...HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA good luck picking your nose on that much smack, let alone using a shotgun.  Anyone who has done smack knows its impossible.
0743454537|4.0|I have a bad habit of reading reviews even while reading the book, which I did with this one when I was about 1/3 through.  After reading many reviews about the end of the book I thought of skipping to that and am so glad that I didn't do that.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I felt that the ending really fit the story.  This book was well-written and thought-provoking.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This isn't a documentary. It is just a fat, left wing, welfare loving, Democratic but kissing idiot's \\"OPINIONS\\" about President George W. Bush. I am a Bush supporter, (that isn't to say I haven't had any disagreements with him) but even if I were a Democrat I would find this film unsettling. He mocks the commander in chief, harrasses Republican Senators, Interviews some troops over in Iraq and adds a few news clippings and calls it a documentary. And for what? It didn't change the outcome of the elections. Or did it. It could be Michael Moore's <br />efforts backfired on him. His film may have enraged many Republicans and Moderates and it got them to make sure they went out and voted for Bush on November 2nd. And this time the outcome was clear: BUSH DEFINATLEY WON THIS TIME. And he won with a record amount of votes. John Kerry realized this and conceded, which does give me some respect for the man by NOT being Al Gore: the sequel. I am a film maker (not documentary though) and I think it is a shame that any studio would release this film. But Bush won this time, fair and square, and most Americans, Left wing and Right wing, have accepted it this time around. Except for Jesse Jackson, a real idiot. As for this movie, regardless of your party, if you feel you must see it, fine. But be carefull what you believe, after all, he is a film maker, and they do have tricks up they're sleeves. I should know.
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|Some weeks ago I saw Robert Plant performing live in the show of Jools Holland and I was pleasantly surprised by this giant of rock. OK, he does not have the same voice anymore as in the days of Led Zeppelin, but he (and the band) clearly have found new inspiration to make an original rock album. I love this album, it shows good song writing in rock music asks for more than 3 chord songs. The songs show tension, emotion, explode from time to time, etc. A lot happens here on Mighty Rearranger and it seems that the giant Plant has risen up again.
B00000099Y|5.0|This album is a wet dream for every heavy music fan with a brain. Beautifully layered guitars, a throbbing heart-beat bass line and rock solid drumming, teamed with Maynard's thought provoking and poetic lyrics, make for a near perfect sonic assault that will make you think. Go out and buy all of Tool's albums. WARNING if you have attention deficit disorder, or have trouble understanding any more complex themes than \\"breaking stuff\\" or \\"Daddy didn't love me\\" you may be better off listening to Limp Bizkit or Korn.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|My husband and I cranked the surround sound up and went outside to listen to the concert on NBC last night! AWESOME! It brought back so many memories of my highschool years! The band was better than ever! We enjoyed the new songs and am very anxious to get our DVD when it is released.
B000687M48|4.0|Like most Evanescence fans I bought the \\"Anywhere but home DVD/CD\\" combo. This is great for any Evanescence fan. It shows you them on tour. And on the DVD part you get to watch all there music videos on fallen and you get to see behind the scence stuff. It was pretty cool because you got to see a side of Evanescence that you wouldn't know just by there cds. You got to see them goof off and how they get ready for the big concert that night. <br /> <br /> <br />P.S I believe this DVD/CD was made to keep there Evanescence fans going. Because if you think about it, it has 2 years without a cd. And many bands who don't make a cd in this time many of them end up not making it.
B000001Y5J|4.0|'Broken' was like a follow-up EP to the 'Pretty Hate Machine' CD,as NIN vocalist/frontman/producer Trent Reznor was experiencing some legal hassles regarding putting out new NIN material.I remember playing this six song EP over many times when it first came out.Liked the industrial metal goods,such as \\"Pinion\\",\\"Wish\\" and especially happening \\"Happiness In Slavery\\" as I used to put this song on my home answering machine.Very well done.
B00007E8V4|4.0|I put off buying this 'album' simply because I kept hearing it was throwaways that didn't make it to System Of A Down's other albums. But I finally decided to pick this up a while ago, and was pleasantly surprised at how good and consistent it was. Steal This Album! certainly isn't as prominent as their debut or Toxicity (or the recent Mezmerize), but there a lot of songs on here that NEED to be heard. I see a number of people bothered by the antiwar sentiment used throughout this album and its lyrics, but isn't that what Serj and the guys do best? Well, besides rocking, of course.<br /><br />The first three songs here, I believe, are three of the best. \\"Chic 'N' Stu\\"'s bizarre, pizza-topping lyrics make it kind of funny (and a nice let-go if you truly don't like the antiwar lyrics); \\"Innervision\\" is just classic SOAD, leaving us to wonder why the heck it wasn't on an album; and \\"Bubbles\\" has one of the catchiest heavy metal beats around, backed with scathingly smart lyrics. Those three songs alone are worth the price of this. \\"Boom!\\" is more of a spoken-word track, reminiscent of the way the facts were used in \\"Prison Song\\". And the chorus isn't anything more than shouts of 'boom'. Next, \\"N&uuml;guns\\" should get most of its praise for the Egyptian-like guitar interlude. \\"A.D.D.\\", as you will see, is fittingly titled. \\"Mr. Jack\\", a slow-moving song, seems to've only missed Toxicity's cut because \\"Aerials\\" didn't. \\"I-E-A-I-A-I-O\\" and \\"36\\" are (probably) two of the weaker tracks, mainly because \\"36\\" is only 46 seconds long and you can't understand anything in \\"I-E-A-I-A-I-O\\". \\"Pictures\\" is a nice little ditty that sounds like some of the latter tracks on SOAD's debut. \\"Highway Song\\" is another excellent song that shouldn't be ignored, along with the lyrically straightforward \\"Fxck The System\\". \\"Ego Brain\\" is an average track, while \\"Thetawaves\\" uses more spoken word, although it is a bit more likable than \\"Boom!\\" because Serj actually constructs somewhat of a chorus. And finally, although not exactly saving their best for last, \\"Roulette\\" and \\"Streamline\\" finish of this record perfectly. There are no smashing, frenetic guitars; instead Serj's voice takes center stage, making the tracks two of the better, more original ones on Steal This Album!<br /><br />So of the 16 tracks, which total (a measly) 43 minutes, I'd say about eight songs could've easily made the cuts for either of SOAD's albums, even if having them here is just as good. The opening three songs, which are three of the best--not only here, but of all System Of A Down has done--are especially terrific. There is no question that if you loved their debut and/or Toxicity, that you will love System Of A Down's overlooked Steal This Album! I wouldn't necessarily steal it, but make sure you buy this record.finally, although not exactly saving their best for last, \\"Roulette\\" and \\"Streamline\\" finish of this record perfectly.

I wouldn't necessarily steal it, but make sure you buy this record.
0440237688|3.0|Ididn't really like The Giver becuase it didn't have a nice ending. I would have perfered it to be like Jonas and Gabriel reach Elsewhere and decide to go back and the comity of Elders lets Gabriel stayu and live with Jonas and his family and Gabriel grows up to be the receiver of memories and they all live happly ever after. Then I would rate this book beter. I also think that there should be a sequel becuase this is a book that could easly continue. I think that this book could be beter if tryed.                         leboGDOG
B0001LJC2K|3.0|I don't know why people think they have to stick up for musicians and artists.  Let the music stand on its own, and listen on your own accord.  It's not a damn competition.  Everyone's insecure about music they didn't even create-how silly is that?  Anyway, the effort is a good one and the energy is there..it's enjoyable for sure-so if you can find it in yourself to just accept it for what it is, you'll not likely have qualms.
B00008WT5M|4.0|I'm gonna give you the play by play on each song. It goes as follows:<BR>1.Thunderstruck - Once Angus brings you intricate guitar work this song makes you wanna jump up and go nuts<BR>2.Fire Your Guns - One of ACDC's greatest songs ever. Kick ass rythm and a super high paced song the whole way through.<BR>3.Money Talks - A good song that is familiar with not ACDC listeners. Another classic DC song.<BR>4.The Razors Edge - Starts out slow with the guitar then puttin it into high gear. A super great tune and one of the best on the album.<BR>5.Mistress For Christmas - Not good. Play it loud or not at all.Unless its christmas. Best christmas carol ive ever heard <BR>6.Rock your Heart Out - Awesome track. It gets you pumped up and excited because thats what ACDC does.<BR>7.Are You Ready - Another decent track. It gets into the rythm fairly quick and its definitely not a throwaway track.<BR>8.Got you by the Balls - The title alone lets you know ur in for a ride. Its a good song and gives you a good idea of what ACDC are all about<BR>9.Shot of Love - Good track overall. <BR>10.Lets make It - Good pace and sound. Another sweet tune.<BR>11.Goodbye and Good Riddance to Good Luck - Good song, with a pretty good vibe, but it gets a little annoying at the end. Not a bad song by any means.<BR>12.If you dare - another mediocre song that you can recognize as DC but wouldnt brag about.
B0008ISM40|4.0|I haven't heard this album yet but my brother is a big fan and emailed me his review of the new album. This is what he said: Little dissappointed with the new NIN in places - takes time to get into it. I personally perceived the tunes and song structure to be far more poppy and formulaic this time round. Too little creative spontaneity and too many neat little packaged songs for my liking. None of that moody atmosphere that set 'The Fragile' apart or that unapologetic grating brazeness of 'The Downward Spiral'. I know bands must evolve, but there are many ways to skin a cat. I may be wrong and will have to let it mature with more listens. Can the old dog (Trent Reznor) still teach himself any new tricks? Am holding my thumbs.

B000002H2H|5.0|This is Metallica's second album Ride The Lighting which was released in 1984. Although it's not as good as Master Of Puppets, but it's still a classic gem. Picking up where their debut album Kill'Em ALL left off, Ride The Lightning has better production. The opening track Fight Fire With Fire starts off with a little accoustic intro, and suddenly warps into thrashing speed and will have you headbanging throughout. The title cut is another menacing headbanging track as well. For Whom The Bell Tolls and the awesome thrash ballad Fade To Black are two of the band's most popular songs. Creeping Death is another great song, and of course the closing track The Call Of Ktulu is an epic instrumental. James Hetfield's vocals are good, and his rhythm guitarwork is good as well. Kirk Hammet's lead guitarwork is splendid. Cliff Burton's bass lines are very menacing, and Lars Ulrich's drumming is good as well. Anyways, this is a great album and should be a part of your collection. Buy it now! R.I.P Cliff Burton<br /><br />themetalbeast's ratings:<br /><br />1. Fight Fire With Fire: 5/5<br /><br />2.

B0007XT87G|5.0|Because they are unquestionably one of the finest bands presently inhabiting the universe, it's no surprise that Porcupine Tree have created yet another mind-bogglingly flawless masterpiece here with their eighth official studio album. Deadwing is a delicious, deliriously appealing record, vicious and vulnerable in equal measure. By birthing beauty through brutality, modern-day maestro Steven Wilson has succeeded in creating the finest conceptual album of the last decade or so, of course barring the band's previous (and similarly astounding) effort, 2002's In Absentia. <br /> <br />As one with any familiarity to the band whatsoever might anticipate, Deadwing is no easy listen. The storyline unravels with mysterious fluidity, beginning with the teeth-gnashing thesis statement of the title track and ending with the tender otherworldliness of the closer, \\"Glass Arm Shattering.\\" Shifty, heavy tracks like the spitting-snarling \\"Halo\\" and the bitterly ironic \\"Shallow\\" are balanced by moments of sheer beauty, as evidenced by the lovely \\"Lazarus\\" and the eerily gorgeous minute or two at the end of the multi-layered \\"Mellotron Scratch.\\" \\"Open Car\\" and \\"Start of Something Beautiful\\" are a pair of vexing twists, drawing from both modern and classic progressive rock and combining the dramatic differences of these two eras into an ingenious, formidable force. The finest moment on Deadwing comes in the shape of its monolithic 12-minute centrepiece, \\"Arriving Somewhere (But Not Here).\\" It is a bonafide odyssey and the crowning achievement of this record, strengthening it to legendary extents. <br /> <br />Deadwing may be Porcupine Tree's most commercially viable release to date (\\"Shallow\\" seems to have made its way to some of the more adventurous modern rock stations in America), but this in no way dims its appeal and power. This is a completely indisposable record; it never dulls or falls victim to its own pretense. Unlike most of their chronological contemporaries, PT are a bandthat cannot and will not be forgotten by their fans. They will continue to produce beguiling, expansive, and beautiful albums for the entirety of their careers.
B00097A5I6|4.0|Liked the album, nice & loud, Zak Starkey's drumming is superb (Dad must be proud) but the production and engineering could have been a lot better. Most tracks the bass guitar (if it is there at all) is buried way back in the mix, and as a result makes the CD sound like I'm listening to it through a very tinny transistor radio from long ago. Some of the sound of the vocals is not quite up front as it should be either. But on the whole, a nice effort to annoy the neighbors. BTW I am 49 yrs old, am I too old to be listening to Oasis??? lol :-)
B000929AJQ|5.0|This album is an above average masterpiece that, in my humble opinion, is going over the heads of many listeners who are not giving it the time it needs to grow.  NIN has evolved, how long could Trent stay miserable and on drugs (and if you are a true fan would you really have wanted him to...?)  Yes, this album is much lighter than his previous works, but is that such a bad thing.  Every song is extreemly well crafted, and fit together to form an album that requires no skipping, a feet rarely done these days.  There is a maturity to this album, a light at the end of the tunnel so to speak.  I have loved NIN since Pretty Hate Machine but hadn't listened to them in a while since I had grown out of my angry at the world teenage stage.  This is an album that I can listen to and appreciate as an adult.  Ignore the hate, and give this album a chance, it deserves it.  I just copped Gorillaz and Common's new albums and both of them are excellent, but have yet to take NIN's #1 spot in my CD player.   <br /> <br />Stand Out Tracks: <br />Right Where It Belongs <br />Only <br />The Hand That Feeds <br />Getting Smaller <br />Sun Spots <br />With Teeth <br /> <br />Note:  The 5.1 digital version is DEF worth it, it sounds amazing in full surround and you can find the album notes (as well as an explination as to why they are not in the album) at nin.com
B0007XT87G|5.0|I have the good fortune to live in Europe which allows me to see this band at any time when they tour.  I saw them twice this year as they promoted this album.  I plan another outing in July. What can be said???  Nothing..if you can comprehend the universal role of music...buy this album, now.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I must say that I truly enjoyed this excerpt from the DVD and I will be buying it.  the random schmo they have playing lead guitar is pretty good...but...I just wanna know...WHERE'S Don Felder????   <br /> <br />Joe Walsh is as good and funny as ever.
B0007Y08PQ|4.0|To date: <br /> <br />\\"Generations\\" felt like a looooong TV episode, whose villains were second-rate Klingons and a man we'd rather pity.  Add in another version of the Enterprise, numerous TV show tie-ins, a lame explanation of Guinan's origins that put a huge spanner into many elements of Trek's historical canon, altered motivations (Guinan first says it's impossible to go in but 3 sentences later says if Picard goes in he can't get out... okey dokey, then...), and you've got a mess.  Now it's got its moments, and there is a tremendous intellectual appeal that just about saves it for some (myself included) but it's hardly major movie fare.  \\"All Good Things\\" would have been a better choice... <br /> <br />\\"First Contact\\" is a worthless cameo-ridden farce, jumbling all sorts of fan favorites with very little coherence.  Yes, yes, the feds don't trust Picard to fight the Borg.  Yup, that's why they gave him their new flagship...  Yes, there's time travel.  To a period nobody can relate to.  Threat of destroying the ship too, I mean that's okay as there are plenty of letters left in the alphabet, right?  (how about sacking an inept captain for mindlessly destroying his own ship?!)  And, of course, the Borg themselves...   <br /> <br />But this review shouldn't be about a sloppily-written , over-reaching, made-for-movie TV-episode followed by that total wretch of a farce! <br /> <br />\\"Insurrection\\" dares to be new.  It dares to be different.  It dares to keep TV show references to a minimum; I for one didn't need to know all of the events of Deep Space 9 (aka \\"Deep Sleep 9\\") to know that the feds have been in a bunch of wars.  Not being able to stand DS9, it was nice to see how this in-reference was handled.  Indeed, this movie takes this fact and tries to BUILD on it, saying how the federation is a lame duck and it knows it's about to collapse if they get more involved with more enemies.  Indeed, that's an (unintentional?) in-joke to the Bermantrek franchise as, by1998, things were ALREADY getting beyond trite...  where else could they go except to knock down the foundations of the dilapidated house? <br /> <br />Picard gets so angry at the Federation that he is inclined to resign in a big huff'n'puff scene that's actually very well acted.  If it weren't for the rubbish flick that preceeded \\"Insurrection\\", this scene would be much more powerful.  (it was to me, but many a reviewer said the same thing, albeit more undeservedly kindly...)  Instead, it reminds people unfortunate enough to have seen \\"First Contact\\" that Picard had violated orders before.  And in FC, he does so in a pantomime way that's too typical for that flick.  But, again, I digress.  \\"Insurrection\\" gets it right, without the camp comedy to muck things up. <br /> <br />Speaking of comedy, \\"Insurrection\\" is the first TNG film to keep the humor APPROPRIATE; it's almost in-tune with Trek III (or maybe Trek VI) in terms of keeping things serious with the occasional smooth-flowing joke.  I've said before that \\"First Contact\\"'s excessive use of (often forced) humor makes it a farce.  Many jokes are contrived and not even remotely funny.  \\"Insurrection\\" gets the humor right, in tone, wit, and presentation.  All but one, but I will get to that momentarily. <br /> <br />Characterizations:  All in all, none of them is flawed.  The actors put in great performances and there is a sense of fun present.  But unlike \\"First Contact\\" it's apparent that the fun is meant for all of us.  Not just the actors involved.  There's a great villain in Ru'afo (F Murray Abraham) who also gets some great lines. I haven't felt this hyped about a strong villain since General Chang (Trek VI). <br /> <br />The plot:  Some in the Federation, who are weary of collapse due to losing a lot of recent battles with numerous enemies, want to revitalize and heal their own.  They team up with the So'na to extract a special radiation from a distant planet.  The inhabitants of this planet, the Ba'ku, would be adversely affacted by this change.  Of course, things get squirmy when it turns out that the Son'a and Ba'ku are the same race, but whoever said that sci-fi shouldn't involve two factions of the same race?  Meanwhile, Picard ends up in an unexpected love affair (that's refreshingly G-rated and pure in spirit, how could anyone NOT be drawn into the charm of it all?!) while Data marvels that Riker's shaved face.  Made shaven because kiss'n'tell Troi can't stand the beard.  (more well placed humor.) <br /> <br />Here are my problems with the plot: <br />1.  It is suggested that the entire upper eschelon of the Federation has turned bad.  I liked this.  But at the end?  Berman (long-time prodcuer and intellectually bankrupt) decides to say that it was, as usual, just one or two of the Feds that had gone bad.   <br /> <br />2.  After analyzing the Son'a/Ba'ku subplot (what's up with the silly apostrophe marks anyway?), we should be feeling sorry for the Son'a, as they are the PARENTS of the Ba'ku, who had kicked them out.  Yipes. <br /> <br />3.  Picard summarily kills Ru'afo at the end.  I am tired of this macho Picard killing his own officers or killing baddies whenever it suits him routine.  Heck, even Kirk offered to save Khan at the end of Trek II.  But at least Kirk is a human and we can understand why he's had enough of Kruge or gets the last word against Chang.  Picard, for 7 TV seasons, is portrayed as being uber-moral this and life-that.  So now he's a mass killer in the big-screen movies.  Especially when his own crew saved his bacon in \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\", and 2 movies later he's gunning the lot of them down.  I have a big problem with this!  So did Ruby... whoops, I digressed again! <br /> <br />4.  There's a mini-musical of the HMS Pinaforte.  This is the one part of the movie that's utterly contrived.  Yes, it's funny  to see Worf shake his head in an attempt to not sing along, but... yuck. <br /> <br />5.  Worf seems to get his gortch (pubertyjoke) BEFORE arriving on the planet containing the special age-reversing technobabble radiation.  Now we all know Worf got jiggy in \\"The Emmisary\\" (Season 2 TNG) and 9 months later little Alexander came into trekdom so this gortch must be an effect from the radiation. <br /> <br />6.  Technobabble.  Bermantrek goes out of its way to create more and more technobabble (probably so Paramount can cash in on the patents should humankind create a device that fits Trek's description...)  And in this movie there's no exception.  We are an audience.  Not science majors at University.  While \\"Insurrection\\" usually keeps this in check, metaphasic this and hoobie-doobie that gets annoying after a while - but at least it's not the main focus of the story.  Then add in Data's \\"morality circuits\\" and it's amazing nobody broke out in laughter in the theatre.  That is so contrived.  If anyone is a fan of \\"Red Dwarf\\" by the way, Kryten (a send-up of MANY android-type characters and hardly a ripoff of bermantrek...) often talks of his ____ circuits.  Right down to a \\"good taste chip\\".  Except Trek tries to take the same goofy dialogue and make it serious.  No, Berman, please don't.  Data is a complexly programmed android.  Not a fancy Lego creation where removing one green brick can make a world of difference... <br /> <br />7.  There are but 600 Ba'ku.  SIX HUNDRED.  I know there's a great moral tale here (slavery, relocation, wiping out indiginous population, raping of their land, calling oil barons thugs; there are some GREAT lines in this movie that can't be beat), but for 600 people on one huge honkin' planet?!  Couldn't the Feds and Son'a merely open up a hotel/vac ation resort on one of the other continents and bother anybody?!  The idea is lovely, but the execution has a plot hole too big and too many. <br /> <br />The effects?  No contest.  Trek's first mass-use of CGI is exceptional.  I'm an old-school fan of model work, but the CGI in this movie was exceptionally well done.<br /> <br />Ditto for the sets and locale.  While I hate using the \\"R-word\\", this movie truly is rich in its use of location and architecture.  It accentuates the positive aspects of the story... but also reinforces the negative (the small population thing). <br /> <br />DVD quality?  Well, with each Trek release the quality gets better.  As the original release of Insurrection was horrid (making me hunt high and low for the LASERDISC version!), I'm hoping to see better here.  I very likely will. <br /> <br />The extras?  Well, I'll have to update this when the time comes.   <br /> <br />All in all, this movie is grossly underrated.  It's got its faults (how many movies DON'T have problems?!  it's a matter of tolerating the mistakes), but those are made overblown by the movie's detractors (who'd rather see another Borg film with other bermantrek characters pop in and do a little dance) and other overhyped sequels are totally forgiven for far worse mistakes.
B00006RCOB|3.0|Clint Eastwood has starred in a variety of roles over his career.  The character we are most familiar with is macho and self-assured.  Occasionally Clint has taken on unusual roles, such as disc jockey, singer and photographer.  While this movie would appear to be made for a typical Clint Eastwood role, the conflicted character with mental problems that Clint plays is one of his most unusual roles; a role that Clint struggles to pull off.<br /><br />Clint plays Mitchell Gant, an Air Force pilot who suffered a terrible experience in Viet Nam after his capture by the North Vietnamese.  Visions of that incident continue to haunt Mitchell whenever he is in highly stressful situations.  Mitchell is also the best pilot in the world, and is extremely familiar with Soviet military aircraft and tactics.  Thus, he is a potentially ideal choice to travel to the Soviet Union and steal the super secret Mig-31, also known as Firefox.<br /><br />Mitchell is enticed into taking on this mission by a combination of appealing to his abilities and suggesting that the land he is living on might be made available to him permanently.  Mitchell is quickly placed into training for the mission.  For the next hour and a half you get the impression that Mitchell is not in control of his life, either physically or mentally.  Physically he barely understands what is happening around him as people move him from one place to another.  Mentally he continues to have flashbacks and fugues that distract him.<br /><br />The best part of the movie begins with Mitchell's entry onto the Soviet base where the only two prototype Mig-31's exist.  Clint Eastwood finally gets to play the macho character for which he is known, with the exception of one lapse in the shower.  The best scene in the movie, in my opinion, is when Mitchell steals the Mig-31 from its hangar.  I have never seen anyone start a military aircraft as quickly as Mitchell starts the Mig-31.<br /><br />The final portion of the movie is a cat and mouse game between Mitchell and the Air Force and Navy of the Soviet Union.  Mitchell does his best to trick the Soviets into thinking he is going somewhere other than his intended destination.  He must also use his limited fuel to reach a refueling station.  Otherwise he will run out of fuel and crash into the sea.  To add some spice to the movie is the second Firefox prototype, which is quickly loaded with weapons and sent to chase Mitchell down.<br /><br />This movie suffers from a number of problems.  The most significant problem is that the flashbacks Mitchell has are more distracting than illuminating, and quickly become annoying.  The flashbacks added little to the plot and just as little to our understanding of Clint's character.<br /><br />Another, nearly as serious, problem is the stock footage of aircraft used early in the movie.  We see an aircraft mysteriously change between an F-5, an F-4 Phantom and an F-105 Thunderchief (I think those were the transitions).  Though such transitions are common on television shows, a military advisor should have been available to correct this basic error for a movie.<br /><br />Another problem is the dated special effects.  The Firefox mockup is reasonably good, but once the Firefox is in flight it generally lacks reality.  This movie was made in 1982, after the incredible special effects developed for a famous series of science fantasy movies, and better special effects were possible.<br /><br />Another problem with this movie is the pacing.  For most of the first three-fourths of the movie the movie just plods along, with only brief moments of action.<br /><br />Strangely, with as many problems as this movie has, I like it.  It has enough entertainment value that I keep watching it.  However, I struggle recommending this movie to anyone but a hardcore Clint Eastwood fan or someone who likes cold war spy movies, even mediocre ones.s a cat and mouse game between Mitchell and the Air Force and Navy of the Soviet Union.

0385720920|4.0|This book was very good. I was written like a genius. the book held my attention throughtout the whole expanse of the novel. this is a book that will have you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Chuck has found a way to engage the reader in the plot of the book. Althought the theme and lessons from Choke are that of similarity to Chuck's other books like fight club, this one has more of a personal touch and is more freely wirtten. this book shows the human in a stage of trouble and need, and how one person struggles thought the circumstances. The main character int he book hates himself and everyone around him. Throughtout the whole book you will feel frustrated with him and annoyed, but he does the things he does because of how he was brought up and how he has to deal with money problems and his mother. this book is one that will grasp your attention till you set it down. It's a book that is fun  and interesting to read. i loved it!
B000003TBP|5.0|Countless musicians will release that one awesome record that puts them on the map and/or being a huge critical and fan favorite. Fleetwood Mac has Rumours, Motorhead has Ace of Spades, and Nirvana has Nevermind. Well Beck in 1996 released Odelay!, since became a big favorite and although its merits might be a bit overcooked, no denying there is a great record here. <br /> <br />Devil's Haircut: One of my favorite guitar riffs, even if it's so damn simple. Has his trademark Beck-style rapping and his odd lyrics. A more bluesy-rock number and finishing with him screaming the chorus over guitar feedback. Excellent opener. 10/10 <br /> <br />Hotwax: Best way to describe this is one of those country songs after a big drug binge. Has usual odd guitar noises, slide guitar and a spanish chorus. Lots of stuff going on but weirdly listenable. Favorite sound effect is after the first chorus. 9/10 <br /> <br />Lord Only Knows: Weird screaming starts it before it's a country-esque number with what sounds like a beat up tuba in the background. The chorus is ok and the song as a whole is just simply ok. Neat folk guitar ending though7.5/10 <br /> <br />New Pollution: Here we go, getting to some good stuff. Pretty funny intro until it becomes a funky-style number and a nice catchy chorus and some saxophone thrown in. One of the hits. 9/10 <br /> <br />Derelict: Beck must've visited the Middle East and the Orient because it definately sounds like that. Not much of a song though. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Novacane: Another funky number with heavily distorted guitars, almost sounds like a pre-Limp Bizkit song without the lameness. Probably good live but on stereo it's just ok. Bit too long outro. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Jack-Ass: It's a very slow song yet for some reason I love it. The banjo and that weird echo-y guitar and that melodic-yet-monotone singing that Beck does. Might not last past 10 listens but first couple listens it's nice. That donkey at the end just sucks though. 8/10 <br /> <br />Where It's At: One of the most well-known Beck songs yet I can't stand it for some reason. Good keyboard line but that chorus has a shout-it-out quality yet I don't feel the urge too. Too long also. 7/10 <br /> <br />Minus: Big punk-style song driven largely by the bass and rather fuzzy guitars. It's pretty short and there's nothing a lot to say about it but good guitar work. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Sissyneck: The opening whistle might get stuck in your head. Funky bass(or is it guitar?) song and it's pretty good although it probably won't be a big favorite. 8/10 <br /> <br />Readymade: I like that robotic voice in the beginning. It's a more sonically interesting song than an actual song with saxaphones, echo-y guitars and quick keyboard notes. <br /> <br />High 5(Rock the Catskills): A very strange track with rapping, turntables and bullhorn vocals. I hear even Beck doesn't like this song and it just sounds too cluttered like they went overboard with the sounds. 6/10 <br /> <br />Ramshackle: An effective closer with the acoustic guitar at the forefront. Kind of like a pre-cursor to the Mutations/Sea Change stuff. The chorus is nicely sung. Runs a bit too long though but still good. 9/10 <br /> <br />It's funny reviewing a record that gets several 7's and even a 6 yet it's 5 stars but the sum is more impressive than the parts, which is usually a typical Beck album anyway.
0440237688|4.0|The plot of this book was introduced extremley well. The issues described and used throughout the book are things that surrond us in our ordinary lives. It presents the reader with a different society and explains all the hardships and the blessings of that new society. it also showed how different types of people were brought up, and that their envy and differences lead them to the conflicts they face. i give this book four stars because it demonstrated great writing. \\"The Giver\\" had a great flow to it. The beggining and middle were well written but the ending didn't solve any of the mystery, which led it to be a big cliff-hanger. Other then that the book was a very good book to read, and it was very suspenseful, i would recommened this book to everyone because of the way it represents society and the people around us all.

Dolphys Bass Clarinet is intense and powerful, it is full of fast meoldic clusters that are speeding up and down the low and high registers. Bobby Hutcherson, one of the most complete jazz musicians, takes the piano role. His vibes free you up and inspire the soloists. Freddie Hubbard, a fiery young trumpeter at that time, blows some fire and blends well with Dolphys harsh Bass Clarinet, flute, and Alto Sax. \\"Something Sweet, Something Tender\\" starts out as a duet between Dolphy and Richard Davis who is one of the Greatest Bassists of all time. \\"Gazzelloni\\" Features Dolphy's masterful flute playing. The time signitures on this date, were set but not so that it would manipulate the music of its freedom. Tony Williams, a incredilbe drum virtuoso, is displayed well here. His sense of rhythmn is near that of Elvin Jones and Roy Haynes. The only other recording that rivals this one is Andrew Hills point of Departure (see my review) which insludes Dolphy, Davis, and Williams, as well as Hill, Kenny Dorham, and Joe Henderson. The title track of this set is too good. Eric has his alto doing things I'm sure he never dreamed of and I'm not just coming up with words to make this review sound good. If you want a true musical experience then this is essential.
0312323859|5.0|I was really interested that this novel was based on Darcy Rhone the selfish, self-centered woman we pitied in &quot;Something Borrowed&quot;, but yet Emily Giffin did a wonderful job captivating a confused character into finding her real self (and you grow to love her in the end). I recommend you read &quot;Something Borrowed&quot; first for those who haven't. You will not be disappointed!!!
0385510454|2.0|The plot idea for this story was very interesting.  I expected a thriller where the plot truly moves along.  John Grisham spent more time writing about the culture of Italy instead of the plot.  If you are reading the book for the thrill of the chase, then this is not the book for you.  If you like reading about a country's culture, then you will truly enjoy this book.  Although I was disappointed, I still had to read it to find out what happens to the main character.  John Grisham still has the flair to draw in the reader.
0684833395|5.0|Joseph Heller's elaborate satire of war reveals its absurdity and tragicness through contradiction and quagmire that is unequal in any other piece of literature. Heller creates an extrodinary cast that are at the same time sinful and pious, and this is what makes them so human. From the first sentence the reader is drawn into a universe filled with irreverance that makes complete sense, and through it Heller unveils a grand story chapter by chapter that begins with humour, falls into stoicness, and ends in gaiety. A must read for anyone thats looking for a new world to explore.
038073186X|4.0|In the final analysis this novel was too bleak for me.  (There are some modest spoilers in this review.)  I think in other novels -- Mystic River in particular -- Lehane has done a much better job of ensuring a kind of moral equivalence.  That is, actions have consequence, there is typically balance, and characters (good and bad) seem to get what is due them.  Not so in Shutter Island, where, ultimately, bad things -- horrible things -- happen to good people; or, perhaps, minor flaws lead to catastrophy.  And, as noted, the ending is just too bleak for my tastes.<br /><br />So why four stars?  Well, while I personally/subjectively did not particularly like the novel or its ending, being as objective as I can be, it is still a strong work.  The suspense-building is excellently done.  The setting and scenario are engaging.  The \\"twists\\" are well done.<br /><br />And, on this last point, the novel warrants some additional kudos.  A few other books with \\"twists\\" that I have read lately have suffered from the author's disinterest in setting up the twists honestly.  I'm thinking of books like the DaVinci Code and Matchstick Men -- both of which I actually liked overall.  But in both of these books, the authors had to use unfair manipulation, and at times, borderline dishonesty with the reader to shield the twists and even provide unfair misdirection.  Not so with Lehane.  The twists here are honest, and they are in full view.  (Well, almost -- the main character's name is something of a clue about what's going on, but Lehane points us away by giving him a name that is converted into a much different nickname and using that nickname throughout.  But even then, Lehane gives us a clue by having one of the other characters observe the difference between the names -- Teddy and Edward.)  In any event, I respect that about this book, because writing good, honest, fiction with a twist is hard I imagine, and Lehane does it well.<br /><br />Definitely a page turner, and worthy of the 4 stars, but as mentioned, pretty bleak in the final analysis.y of the 4 stars, but as mentioned, pretty bleak in the final analysis.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I admit, when I first listened to the CD, I thought I had wasted my money. I thought Stephen Schwartz's pop score was terrible, Kristen Chenoweth was annoying, Idinia Menzel was terrible, Norbert Leo Butz was unremarkable, and Joel Grey was unoriginal.<br /><br />However, it was the song \\"Defying Gravity\\" that got me going. The more I listened to it, the more I like it until I began to love it.<br /><br />I love everything about the Stephen Schwartz score. It is so artistically done and his lyrics are satisfying. I definitely think he was robbed of the Tony for this dazzling score.<br /><br />Kristen Chenoweth is amazing! One minute she has a soaring soprano voice, the next she has a cute character voice, and then she has her pop voice. Her talent and acting ability are extraordinary and she plays Glinda to perfection.<br /><br />The recording would not be complete without Norbert Leo Butz's hard rock vocals. He bring such power and force to the role of Fiyero that he's sure to raise the roof.<br /><br />Joel Grey acheives great comic success with his vaudeville-inspired song \\"Wonderful.\\" At first I didn't like this song because I thought it bore too much similarity to Chicago's \\"Mr. Cellophane.\\" However, it slowly grew to be one of my favorites.<br /><br />And then there's Idina Menzel, who undoubtedly desereved the 2004  Leading Actress in a Musical Tony. She dynamically capture's Elphaba's passion, firey attitude, and yearning to be understood.  She nails every song, especiall \\"Defying Gravity.\\" I am know one of her biggest fans.<br /><br />If at first you don't like this recording, try and try again, as it worked wonders for me. It truly is a work of art and no musical theater collection is complete without this brillianty cast recording.
0739313061|2.0|Bobby Dodge is a police sniper who is called to a hostage situation.  From his vantage point he witnesses a husband threatening his wife and small child with a handgun.  When it becomes apparent that the man is about to shoot the woman, Bobby blows him away, and his troubles begin.  The dead man was the only son of an influential judge, who alleges that the dead man's wife, Catherine Gagnon, orchestrated the whole situation.  Soon Bobby is accused of having an affair with the widow, and begins his own investigation while on mandatory leave from the police department.  What he uncovers is chilling and before he knows it he's in over his head.<br /><br />There's little suspense to the story, as the author basically lays everything out, and doesn't bother to try to hide much.  The main character of Officer Dodge is about the least likeable person possible, although Catherine Gagnon is probably worse.  Bobby constantly follows the most illogical course of action in everything he does; repeatedly meeting with Catherine, Judge Gagnon and his private detectives, breaking up with a devoted and wonderful girlfriend, etc.  A bunch of psycological nonsense is thrown in to explain his actions, of course, because he hates his mother.  And, most ridiculous of all, is the *exciting* conclusion, with about the cheesiest writing imaginable - as they're trying to be quiet (lots of people have been killed, some by being punched) the mother-in-law starts into lengthy monologues of what's happened.  And Catherine \\"reeking of gunpowder\\" after having fired several shots (all missing wildly), covered in perspiration, her hair matted to her head, and Bobby's thinking how beautiful she is.  I laughed out loud!  Add to it a dose of disgusting pedophilia and plenty of smut and foul languange, and I honestly can't recommend this book.  I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1 simply because the story was mildly interesting, enough that I actually finished it.
B000002KY8|5.0|Many of the used dealers seem to have only an older version of 1999 on CD, which does not include the track D.M.S.R.  This was the first track on side 2 of the old cassette from the early '80s (and presumably also the LP).      The CD cover says the track was left off due to early CD space constraints.  Anyway, a newer version exists with everything, I now own it.    D.M.S.R. is a very strong dance/funk track on the CD and I would recommend checking with used dealers before buying from them, since at least 2 have had only the incomplete version (several others have not responded, which suggests they too have only the incomplete version).    Probably best to pony up the Amazon full price on this classic baby.    (Later:  I have now heard from a couple used dealers who have the  complete version in stock.)
B00005Y6YB|4.0|Maybe someone can explain why the DVD introduction is in surround and the movie is in mono. Can we get surround someday? I would buy a new copy just to get Lonesome Dove in surround sound and hear that great musical score as it should be heard. <br /> <br />I love the movie!! <br /> <br />
B00092ZMDY|5.0|As a 30+ year fan, I am amazed at how even better they sound now than even on Hell Freezes Over.  They are my all-time favorite band, both as vocalists and songwriters, and this show DOES NOT disappoint.  One loves The Eagles for their exquisite harmony, poetry of their lyrics (especially Henley), and different styles of songs ... AND IT IS ALL HERE. The musicians accompanying them are unbelievable too .. from the power horns, keyboardists, violinist, etc.  I am of the same generation as these guys, and seeing Don Henley sing Desperado at the end gave me chills as well as a few tears.  I cannot wait to see more of his solo work on the DVD.  If you love the Eagles, YOU MUST HAVE THIS DVD.   (By the way, I believe NBC is rebroadcasting it tonight 6/2 on Bravo).   <br />
0060930349|3.0|Paul Johnson's book \\"The History of the American People\\" is quite entertaining and full of dizzying facts and anecdotes from history.  The major problem with his work, though, is how Johnson confuses the presentation of history and fact with his own opinion and, frequently, extreme interpretations.  As the previous reviewer commented (\\"He Should Have Stopped at 1960\\"), something happens in the book as the latter half of the twentieth century is approached.  The earlier history of America he presents with vibrancy and, I suspect, even-handedness.  I did note his celebration of the alleged \\"Robber-Barrons\\" and liberal economics, as well as a conspicuous absence of sympathy for unions and the legitimate concerns over labor abuses.  He appears to subscribe to the \\"Great Man Makes History\\" school - the little man is often overlooked.  It was, however, not until his discussion of the 1960's and beyond that his blaring biases become evident.  According to Johnson, Kennedy and Clinton could do no right, Reagan no wrong, Nixon is a misuderstood hero, the press is the great liberal villain, and all the ills of American society can be traced to misguided liberalism.  He presents the usual smorgasborg of conservative thought as utterly blameless.  He picks and chooses historical facts which confirm, but never challenge, his biases. <br /> <br />The truth is that I did enjoy this book, albiet with growing dissappointment in latter chapters.  While Johnson does descend considerably into strident ideology at the end, nonetheless he is an eloquent and multifaceted writer.  In his defense, he does acknowledge in the preface that he makes no effort to conceal his opinions in this text.  I reccomend this book for two purposes: (1) for those wanting a readable and insightful account of American History prior to the 20th Century; and (2) for those desiring an articulate though unoriginal insight into the commmon conservative dogma that has, for better to worse, come to dominate the beginning of the 21st century.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I just saw the eagles on channel 4 this evening and now i just pre-ordered the dvd. Can't wait to see it again! The Eagles are so great. They are the greatest rock band in the world! I also have the Hell Freezes Over dvd and The Best Of The Eagles cd.  <br />I very much enjoy listening to The Eagles.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Every few years I look forward to a new Rammstein album, and Reise Reise is absolutely incredible. I agree with one reviewer, to pick one song on the album as the best is impossible, like always, Rammstein has hit a home run with every song. As for the review of \\"Rammstein sucks\\" how about you actually give a single reason why you think this album is piss poor, any damn fool can write a one line review. When Ramstein comes near my town, I will pay whatever it takes to see them rock my brains out. <br />
B000023VR6|5.0|Even though is more an Aftermath CD and not a Dr. Dre CD it is still classic. with artists like Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, Xzibit, Kurupt, and Knoc-Turnal adding to the CD. Dre laid down some of his best beats ever on 2001. with so many classics songs i cant name them all but the best, and they are all good, are \\"Still D.R.E.\\", \\"XXplosive\\", \\"Whats the Difference\\", \\"Forgot About Dre\\", \\"Nest Episode\\" and \\"The Message\\". Anyone and everyone should definitley cop this CD.
0920236820|5.0|In a world obsessed with all things Princess this book should be very well received and appreciated by girls everywhere.  A terrific story about the feisty, intelligent Princess Elizabeth who treks to save her prince from the nasty dragon only to be received with no appreciation but judgment, The Paper Bag Princess shows girls that they should be respected and appreciated for their inner beauty and strengths including determination, courage, heart and wit and not solely on their outward appearance. This book should be in every girl's library right in the middle of all her fairytale princess books.  A little dose of reality is good because a girl needs to know early in life that not all relationships are worth staying in. A woman should give and receive love, respect and appreciation in order for a healthy, satisfying relationship to exist.  Remember, as someone once said, \\"You get what you settle for.\\" Bravo, Munsch!<br /><br />Soar!
B00006LWSF|4.0|With Intersope and Eminem at the head of this CD you know its gonna be fire. pretty much very song on this CD is hot. Its got Eminem, 50 Cent, Obie Trice, D12, Xzibit, Rakim, Nas and Gangstarr. With an Allstar cast like that how could u pass on it. The movie was good the CD is good, cop it.
B00005YXZH|2.0|So, everyone's favorite somnambulist grunge muswell hills hero tells us now that he has been addicted to painkillers. I, for one, am not surprised! Summerteeth is the one worthwhile record this band has produced, with sounds from eno, lennon, brian wilson and others blended together in an off-kilter formalism of subverted swagger. But this record? Please! If your in love with the idea of loving Wilco than love this too! Otherwise, steer clear of the pretension and the passionless pedantry. Get Spoon fed or borrow Ian Hunter's lead (as in better dead than read).
B0006A9FKA|4.0|\\"Shaun\\" is a great movie that shows what a zombie attack would be like in real life. Imagine your life going down the drain; girlfriend breaks up with you, your step dad hates you, a pen in your shirt is leaking, and the last thing you need are zombies. At first, Shaun and his friends don't even think they are zombies, but just drunks. They soon discover how wrong they are.<br /><br />At moments, the movie is very touching and at moments very sad, even some scenes that bring you to tears. And at other moments, funny as all get out! This movie is good at being serious when it wants to be and funny when it wants to be.<br /><br />The only disappointment I had with this movie is the ending; a little dumb that kind of killed the entire point of the movie. I know the ending was supposed to be funny/scary, take it anyway you want, but it made you wonder why so many had to die if that's what happened at the end. Watch it find out what I'm talking about.
0316666343|1.0|I completely agree with the reviewers who labeled this book as overly-hyped.  When I expressed concern about the gruesome and morbid topic, friends said, \\"Oh no, not at all. She's already dead when it starts. It's just about her watching her family from heaven.\\" I found this to be completely wrong. <br /> <br />First of all, when is a graphic depiction of a girl lured into a hole in the ground, raped, and murdered (including a \\"delicious death moan\\") not morbid or gruesome? I found it downright macabre.  I felt kicked in the stomach from the time I began reading and the sensation did not leave me for the duration of the book.  The other thing to understand is that one of the main characters is a twisted man who stalks, preys upon, rapes, and murders girls and women. His sickening crimes are threaded throughout the story, though not in the detail of the initial scene. <br /> <br />The characters are poorly developed.  The relationship between the narrator's parents is so sparsely depicted that it is difficult to be sad when the mother walks out on the family. <br /> <br />When the narrator is given a sudden, surprising opportunity to enter the body of a friend on earth, does she lead her beloved father whom she constantly watches from \\"my heaven\\" (a bland existence in no way evocative of any sort of spiritual realm) to the evidence? No.  She has a brief, vividly depicted sexual encounter with a teenaged boyfriend.  Is it just me, or did any other reader find it bizarre that a girl who died during an act of sexual violence would choose to spend her brief reincarnation in this manner? <br /> <br />The pat, trite, and unsatisfying ending is only missing the phrase, \\"And they lived happily ever after.\\" <br /> <br />The inclusion of significant clues (the victim's big blood stain in the garage that is mentioned at least twice) that go nowhere is confusing.  <br /> <br />Here's the bottom line:  Lots of people love this book, and you may very well turn out to be one of them.  If it appeals to you, give it a try. Don't read it due to the hype; read what you love.  If it doesn't grip you in the first chapter or two, put it down, becauae it doesn't improve.  It may appeal strongly to teenagers. I used to have a stronger stomach for this subject matter and the narrator's age would be a draw. It may be that I'm just too old for this book.  <br /> <br />Happy reading!
B0000029DD|5.0|Grace is a rarity in modern recordings.  Influences from Nashville to the Delta echo throughout, while the entire recording is chock-full of gems.  A haunting cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"hallelujah\\" is both powerful and submissive at once.  All the melodies eventually blend into a concise whole, possibly the best road-trip record in history.  References to nightmares that \\"suck me under\\" are eerily prophetic concerning the late Buckley's demise.   <br />Jeff's voice and vocal prowess are astonishing.  It's sad this accomplishment won't be topped, the possibilities certainly seemed endless at the time of its release.
B0007OCG56|4.0|I have to admit I really enjoyed this flick. I thought the casting was first rate. Cloris L was hysterical. Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni  should have gotten much more recognition for their performances and the girl that played their daughter? Priceless. The story starts out really promising; an anxious  type-A woman hires a laid back gorgeous maid who can't speak English (but is more expressive than she'll ever be!). The family reacts in different ways, as does the maid and her daughter. I really wanted more interaction between the two daughters--exploring that aspect would have enriched the storyline quite a bit.  This movie could have gone deeper into each relationship, actually. So much is glossed over in favor of the romance between husband and maid. That said, this movie's script is fine and fun. Uneven at times, yes, but entertaining. Like I said, the performances are awesome..even if you have to believe Sandler is a world class chef!
B0007XT87G|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet. I came across a 10 second snippet of the end of one song on this CD on XM radio and thought, \\"that sounded interesting\\". I looked at my scrolling readout and said, \\"hmmm. Porcupine Tree? Goofy name!\\" But I took a chance and bought this album. I was blown away by some of the best music I have heard in 20 years. <br />Fans of melodic, sometimes simple, yet sometimes complex and always beautiful music will also hopefully enjoy the piledriver sound of amazingly moving music. I swear, I almost wrecked my car I was so fired up! This album both rocks hard AND lulls you with sweet melody, moving lyrics and fantastic musicianship.  <br />A MUST have in any music fan's collection, and that goes for \\"In Absentia\\" too. Also a great, great CD.
0743265289|4.0|Here is my take on this book -<br /><br />This book will benefit you if you are looking for the following(s) -<br /><br />1. To get a good idea of what types of questions are generally asked in each section of GMAT. By \\"types\\" I don't mean level of toughness of the questions, but the variety of question types that are asked. If knowing this helps you build a strategy or know what your strengths/weaknesses are and set goals accordingly, then this book should interest you.<br /><br />2. Read this book earlier on. What I mean is this book discusses strategies on how to handle different question types, so if you are mid-way into you preparation, chances are that you already have a strategy (good or bad) for different questions and are not likely to change everything just because you have got a new book.  Also, it is my opinion that changing strategy mid way can be painful even if marginally beneficial.<br /><br />3. No CD is a big let down. I expected some tests at the end but no so.<br /><br />4. The cover claims there are hundreds of questions... may be only 150-200 max. I won't call it \\"hundreds of questions...\\" !<br /><br />5. Verbal seems stronger that Quants, though this  may be my opinion because I feel much more in control of my Quants than verbal and so see more scope for improvement in verbal.<br /><br />6. Should spend time practicing the strategies you learn her when you work on other books, else the material in this book can be forgotten very fast.<br /><br />Would not be much beneficial if you are -<br /><br />1. Looking for more questions to solve. there are no tests and no CD.<br /><br />2. a couple of weeks away from the test. It will only end up scaring you by its high octane questions! Also, the author's love for talking can be a turn-off when you don't have too much time for chatting! :)<br /><br />3. If you are still going though basic grammar and math skills that are needed for GMAT. This book does not cover the basic study material and makes thatclear to the reader.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br /><br />I am still going through the book though I have spent a few hours skimming through it. I was skeptical earlier on but as I read some sections I did see that the material was useful. But since I am in the middle of my preparations, I am not sure how much it will benefit me. My feelings about the book are mixed.<br /><br />I still give it 4 stars because it is good in what it does though what it does may not match your expectations or needs!  depending  on where you are in you preparation. :)<br /><br />that's all folks!<br /><br />good luck
0425068080|4.0|I haven't read Agatha Christie since junior high or so, and I recall her writing as equal parts frustration -- tying my brain in a knot -- and exhilaration -- even if I didn't scry the mystery, I felt smarter for having read Christie. Not wanting to jump back into her writing with what I was sure was going to be a convoluted, complex, and complicated full-length novel, I wanted to reintroduce myself to the world of Hercule Poirot with some shorter-form fiction. Hence, \\"The Under Dog and Other Stories.\\" <br /> <br />Christie's writing isn't as tangled as I remembered -- and while I still feel smarter having read her, I'm just as frustrated by my inability to be one step ahead of the Belgian detective. There are nine stories here, ranging between 12 and 70 pages in length. And they're all satisfying. My favorites include \\"The Under Dog\\" and \\"The Plymouth Express,\\" but they all have their charm. <br /> <br />One major irritation: In this Berkley paperback edition, the editors opted to insert little text bits before the end of several stories that state something akin to, \\"It is suggested that the reader pause in his perusal of the story at this point, make his own solution of the mystery -- and then see how close he comes to that of the author.\\" <br /> <br />Christie isn't a juvenile writer, and her work deserves less juvenile treatment. Thoughtful readers will take pause regardless of the editors recommendation.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I just saw it on TV and it just made me want more!  Only half the show (if that) was broadcast on tv.  I've heard some of the 2004 Japan shows, but they didn't include the new songs, I also liked the inclusion of the brass and the violin, it sounded really cool.  Can't wait for this, have had it pre-ordered since it went up here :)
B0007TKNIS|3.0|I feel very glad that i had seen Phantom of the Opera on Broadway twice in my lifetime. Seeing Phantom on stage is a wonderful experience: the scenery, the theatrics, the music, the singing, the acting, the emotion, and the heart and character that makes this musical very moving and affective. And yes, the movie does capture the scenery and theatrical aspect of the show very well. But the main problem is the lack of emotion in the music, the singing, the acting, the emotion, and the heart and soul of the play. First of all, the soundtrack for this movie sounds very wooden, and it doesn't make a big bang on songs like \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" and \\"The Music of the Night\\" as it did originally. The acting: so, so. I just thought at times that there was not enough acting involved to actually make you connect with the characters. At times the roles of the main characters (including the Phantom himself) was cringing and dull to the point where i wished that the movie was going to end! The main problem i have about this film is the way the phantom is portrayed: handsome and charming, with porcelain skin, a flawless body, and very nice hair. Now, is this the type of phantom that we are expected to believe is conniving, grotesque, and hideous? I mean seriously, at times i thought he was Zoro or Ben Affleck. Even when the mask is revealed you question what the big fuss is about. What was supposed to be a monster looking creature was instead a suave actor that had a bad hair day and a bad rash and sun burn. One word: LAME. It's just disappointing. Not only was it distracting, but it was simply annoying. At that point you feel less intimidated by the phantom, and feel less and less convinced that this phantom is worth the screams that the characters give in his presence. I can go on and on about the flaws of this film really. The only good qualities about this film is the look of the film, it's well done and doesn't look cheap or overdone. But what it does well on the glammor of the costumes and stage setting is horribly lacking or missing on what should really matter: the emotion.the costumes and stage setting is horribly lacking or missing on what should really matter: the emotion.
B000002IP1|5.0|Following the mediocre, yet extremely sucessful 'No Jacket Required', Phil Collins got two of his previous feats and combine them; take great and varying music and add a lot of commercial success. It is true that four of these songs become GIANT hits and two others were pretty big hits (Top 20). This album is the best of his sucessful period (1981 - 1990).  <br /> <br />Track-by-track Commentary <br /> <br />01 - Hang in long enough <br /> <br />A very good up-beat song that is used frequently on his world tours. One of the singles that maintained Top 20 hit power, but wasn't a huge hit. In this, Phil gives advice to someone who is thinking about making it big. The horns give the song its power. <br /> <br />02 - That's just the way it is <br /> <br />A more quiet song in the form of a typical ballad follows. The other Top 20 song. In this, Phil (and back-up singer David Crosby) discuss the subject of war and conflict that never seem to end. The line 'I don't know why, why do we keep going on, pretending to be oh so strong' illustrates the song well. <br /> <br />03 - Do you remember? <br /> <br />Yet another ballad that would probably be best off someplace else on the album. It is a good ballad that I like, but it is possibly the weakest song on the album. It's about Phil discussing with his past lover (Andrea??) about whether she remember what their relationship was like. A huge hit from the album. <br /> <br />04 - Something happened on the way to heaven <br /> <br />Well, here's some relief from the two ballads. A very uptempo piece similar in terms of themes to 'Do you remember?' but with much better music, but with lacking lyrics. Another giant hit from the album. <br /> <br />05 - Colours <br /> <br />A very, very good piece of music. My favourite off of the album. Could be labeled as progressive-pop, as it is like two songs in one with an incredible middle section weighing in at 8:51. The theme sounds dated now, but it was a messagge to the leader of South Africa of the time. Racial discrimination was a big thing there at the time, but has since been lifted.  <br /> <br />06 - I wish it would rain down <br /> <br />Another love song, another giant hit, but this is with a twist. Bringing Eric Clapton in on guitars and having a large choir come in makes this otherwise ballad-type piece into a very gospel-ish   piece! I like the departure from normal ballads on a love song and if only Phil would do it more often. <br /> <br />07 - Another day in paradise <br /> <br />The last of the huge hits. This won a Grammy in 1990 for 'Best Original Song' and it lives up to that award even to this day, when the homeless are still a big concern, but are greatly ignored by both the media and the everyday folk. This is a great song, and definitely the best of the hits. <br /> <br />08 - Heat on the street <br /> <br />A nice short piece about the social-economic class spread in Britain, and equipped with the horns it makes for a fine listen. Not his best on here, but it is a listenable song. <br /> <br />09 - All of my life <br /> <br />A beautiful ballad unlike the others on here. The saxophone adds a very nice touch onto it. This is Phil talking about his great regrets in life, especially on the last few lines: <br /> <br />'All of my life there have been regrets that I didn't do all I could. Playing records upstairs while he watched TV, I didn't spend the time I should. That's a memory I will live with all of my life.' <br /> <br />10 - Saturday night and Sunday morning <br /> <br />A very short (1:25) instrumental that has two seperate moods to it, thus Saturday Night AND Sunday Morning. It is extremely good, but it makes you want more, and definately not of what follows.  <br /> <br />11 - Father to Son <br /> <br />A gentle ballad of a father giving relationship advice to his son. Not that memorable, as he did a better job with this on 'Come with me' on his Testify album, but its climax really leads into the last song perfectly. <br /> <br />12 - Find a way to my heart <br /> <br />Wow! Now these are the type of songs that I wish Phil would make more of! There is a mixture of a space-age rock beginning, African inspired drums, the Phoenix horns and a Phil Collins power ballad to make perfection. Take me home, one of the best off No Jacket Required could not compare to this finalee. Just simply perfection as a musical piece. <br /> <br />Overall: An incredible CD full of different moods, but like any other, it has its lows (Father to Son, Do you remember?) and peaks (Colours, Find a way to my heart, All of my life, Another day in paradise).  <br /> <br />If you are a passerby Phil Collins fan (who only knows the hits),  I strongly recommend this, you won't be disappointed!
B000002UYZ|2.0|First off,as far as the music is concerned the album deserves a full 5.I don't care if certain songs are in mono or stereo as long as they sound good.<br />Second off,for some reason unbeknownst to me,Capitol Records chose to put \\"1962-1966\\" out as two discs.It could have very easily fit on one disc,thereby slashing some of this re-issue's HUGE overprice.Capitol Records is why I'm only giving this album 2 stars.<br />Third and finally,\\"Revolver\\" was poorly represented.Capitol could have added a couple of tracks from that album as bonus selections.
B00080ZG10|5.0|It's not often that a bio pic comes along that impresses me. BUT, The Aviator did just that. I found the acting, the sets and the costumes visually stunning and the length of this film (near 2 1/2 hours) flew by. I had seen the movie when it first came out and I was surprised to find myself not shifting in my seat and looking at my watch as in most drawn out films of this nature.  <br /> <br />If you know nothing about Howard Hughes, you'll learn a lot. If you know everything about Howard Hughes, you'll enjoy seeing him come back to life thanks to the amazing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. <br /> <br />This is one DVD that I'm proud to own and will repeatedly watch each year. Great film!

006054094X|3.0|I buy into the amount of research that this book seemed to hold. The author spared no expense in his search for the truth. The Chinese did explore the earth. They did send their ships abroad. But ultimately the traditional nature of the Chinese life doomed their exploits from being recognized. Upon returning from the world crossing travels, the Chinese were forced to forget their learnings.  <br /> <br />The author, however isn't that much of a storyteller. The story to be told is missing. Chapter after Chapter passes by filled with fact after fact, but the human interest is lost on the reader. Perhaps this is simply because of the missing records, but 456 pages of these facts, followed by almost 200 pages of notes, appendices, and indexes cannot create a gripping read.  <br /> <br />I am a man of the facts, but there must be a way of telling it with interest. The tale is lost without accesibility.
B00006AW2S|4.0|Though it's a formulaic package of half cover versions/half originals typical of the era, OUT OF OUR HEADS stands as the best of the early Stones albums from the 1964-5 period.  The reason: the Stones start to find their voice, signalled by the legendary song, Satisfaction, which broke them in the U.S. and worldwide.<br />Perhaps spurred by the phenomenal success of Satisfaction, the Stones sound confident on almost every track of this album starting with the cover version of Mercy Mercy.  When I first heard this years ago on the old mono vinyl the Stones sounded like a punk band -- Jagger's aggressive vocals and above all the fuzz-guitars which are mixed to the forefront and leap out of the speakers.  Who ever sounded like this?<br />Though the Otis Redding and Sam Cooke originals are better, That's How Strong My Love Is and Good Times are fine covers by the Stones.  Same goes for the anguished delivery of Cry To Me.  Hitch Hike a decent version of the Marvin Gaye tune (the opening riff was later copped by the Velvet Underground on their first album).<br />Jagger and Richards hit their stride with the above-mentioned Satisfaction, but also The Last Time, Play With Fire and the tongue-in-cheek Spider and The Fly.<br />The only weaknesses are Under Assistant West Coast Promo Man, which is really a rip-off of Fanny Mae (an outtake from this album) and the disposable One More Try.<br />Note that this remaster doesn't sound any different from the original issue of the 80s, and is light years different from the later UK issue, which featured a weaker song list.<br />OUT OF OUR HEADS is no masterpiece, but for sheer pleasure this album won't disappoint.
0802130208|5.0|One of the funniest books ever written. <br /> <br />The author, unfortunately, committed suicide after failing to sell the book. It was sold by his mother, after his death, and won a Pulitzer. The story behind the book is almost as good as the book itself. <br /> <br />In any case, it is a comic masterpiece. It includes some of the most original characters in literature, involved in situations which should (if you posess any sense of humor whatsoever) have you laughing aloud many, many times. <br /> <br />I envy you, if you have not read this book yet, but are about to do so. You are about to discover a tremendous joy.
B000002UAR|5.0|1966 was The Beatles' greatest year.  True, this year they ended touring, almost got killed in the Phillippines, and were denounced in America with record-burnings after Lennon said, &quot;We're bigger than Jesus.&quot;  Yet, out of this chaos rose The Beatles masterpiece, REVOLVER.<br />REVOLVER was considered Just Another Beatles Record when it was released in August 1966 and to some was considered their swan song in the dying days of Beatlemania.  However, REVOLVER has stood the test of time and today outshines SGT. PEPPER.  The reason is that the 1987 CD release ignored the inferior 11-track U.S. version of REVOVLER (omitting John's I'm Only Sleeping, And Your Bird Can Sing, Dr. Robert) and belatedly presented to North Americans the complete British 14-song album.<br />REVOLVER represents The Beatles at the top of their game.  The level of composition is at its highest, outshining PEPPER and everything that followed.  There is not a weak song here, lyrically or musically.  The instrumentation by all four Beatles reaches its peak.  Ringo, especially, earns top marks  songs like She Said She Said and Tomorrow Never Knows.  Lastly, the level of experimentation and breath of style is staggering.  There are so many styles of music on REVOLVER, from classical to Indian raga to ballad to hard rock to soul and sampling (then called &quot;tape loops&quot;) that the album almost bursts at the seams.  Above all, this is a group effort which is lacking in later records such as the The White Album.<br />George takes a quantum leap forward on REVOLVER.  He kicks off an album for the first time with Taxman, which features some of the sharpest lyrics ever to appear in a Beatles' song.  Taxman signals that this is no Beatles album like any other.  The lyrics are not cute, but bitter and biting, backed by one of Paul's best-ever bass lines (copped by Beck in The New Pollution).  George's anger is also heard in the Raga-ish Love You Too, a rocking song that left many fans puzzledin 1966, but which has aged better than Within You Without You.  His I Want To Tell You is a fine contribution to side two.<br />Paul displays his melodic, gentle side with two of his finest love songs, Here There and Everywhere and For No One, which feature exquisite vocals in the former, and a sparse but mournful arrangement in the latter.  Unlike Michelle, Paul here avoids sentimentality and achieves beauty.  Got To Get You Into My Life is a driving number featuring towering horns a la Stax, and actually describes an early pot experience (not acid as widely believed).  Yellow Submarine (sung by Ringo) is a fun children's song, and Good Day Sunshine is also lighthearted and catchy without being shallow.<br />Most of all Eleanor Rigby stands as Paul's masterpiece, more mature in lyric and arrangement than Yesterday and not melodramatic and overproduced like the later She's Leaving Home.  Rigby remains one of the Beatles' best lyrics and perhaps their most haunting tune.  It never ages.<br />John too reaches a peak with REVOLVER.  I'm Only Sleeping is an introspective song featuring backward guitars and confessional lyrics.  She Said She Said recounts an acid trip in L.A. with Peter Fonda, and features some of Lennon's most harrowing imagery and stunning guitars-and-drums.  And Your Bird Can Sing and Dr. Robert are fine rock songs.  <br />Tomorrow Never Knows is the stunning conclusion to the album, full of tape loops, Ringo's hypnotic drumming and otherworldly lyrics inspired by the Tibetan Book of the Dead.  Nothing ever sounded like this before and arguably not since.<br />REVOLVER is the culmination of four talents peaking at the same time.  Others will insist on PEPPER as the definitive Beatles statement, but PEPPER has weaker songs, is self-consciously psychedelic, and is lopsided, favouring McCartney.  REVOLVER sounds as fresh today as in 1966, and stands at the pinnacle of the Beatles' recording career.  This is my favourite Beatles album and I never tire ofplaying it.  Few albums by any band continue to sound fresh.  <br />All Beatles albums have their qualities, but if there is one Beatles record you must pick up, this is the one.
B0007XT7V8|3.0|I think this is a solid rock album, worthy of a good listen.  However, I heard all of these great reviews for this album, and I felt like the album didn't quite live up to the reviews, for me at least.  I've listened to this album several times through and I can say that I like a couple of songs.  They are good musicians, but seem to rarely grab the listener and yank you into the song.  Just some good old fashioned rock and roll.  There are some flourishes of genius though(some really good guitar solos), which makes me curious enough to check out there first album.  I do disagree with some of the reviewers opinion of T.O.A.D.M. being better then Nickelback.  I've thoroughly enjoyed each of Nickelback's albums, and find that they have a little bit of a harder edge then TOADM.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Shame on me.  I had never listened to Alison Krauss before buying this CD, but being a growing fan of soulful female folksy vocalists (Gillian Welch, Indigo Girls, etc.), I got this CD on the strength of its reviews. <br /> <br />I was truly amazed; this CD is astonishing, and exudes such exceptional musicianship, warmth, and emotion that it forces me to sit down and give it my full attention every time I listen to it. <br /> <br />Alison's voice is wonderful, a solid blend of pop and country, always crystal clear, always perfectly pitched.  The blend of songs is extremely compelling too: from playful bluegrassy numbers to spine-chilling love songs (\\"New Favorite\\" - where you can tell it's a Gillian Welch song, but Alison really gives it extra dimension), and some great great great musical pieces.  The blend of guitar, banjo, dobro and bass is so tight and crisp, it's an absolute delight to listen to. <br /> <br />This recording is true musical inspiration at its best.  By all means get it and savor it for years to come.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I can't get these songs out of my head.  I went out and bought the new Audioslave album, but have hardly listened to it, in favor of this album.  At first listen I immediately loved tracks 2-8, with the other tracks seeming more like filler.  But, upon a second listen, I was won over by the remaining songs.  As  other reviewers have stated, this is a great cd from start to finish.  As ridiculous as the lyrics are in alot of these songs, I still find my self belting them out right along with Serj.  Even though comparisions of Serj's vocal style to Jello Biafra's have been made from day one, I could really hear the similarities on this album(which is fine, considering Jello is an awesome vocalist).  Daron's guitar work is amazing on this album.  He has topped himself with each effort to date.  Likewise with John.  I am a drummer, and it is a treat to listen to John's creative rythms and changes.  I appreciate his ability to be able to incorporate alot of drumming without sounding like too much noise, and actually play for the songs.  He is one of the tightest drummers around.  All in all, if you like heavy music and don't already own this album, buy it now!
0679777547|4.0|This is a mind-bending novel about the Devil and the Three Musketeers.  You can look up the plot anywhere you want.  Perez-Reverte crafts a book about a man who hunts down books into a chilling dark exploration of the underworld.  Normally I don't go in for \\"devil\\" books or even horror films, but this one is really unique.  A page-turner.
B000026FOA|5.0|Nearly unknown in his own day, but revered by his contemporaries, Nick Drake has had a bit of a renaissance in the wake of, of all things, the use of one of his songs in a Volkswagon commercial (\\"Pink Moon\\" from the album of the same name).  But this album was his first, and in many ways, his best. <br /> <br />Drake's legacy is sadly pretty small-- three albums during his lifetime and two posthumous collections.  His music is melancholy, in ways no one else's is.  Understated, often punctuated (on this record and its followup \\"Bryter Layter\\") by a mournful arrangement, lightly sung in Drake's smoky tenor, the music is effecting-- I find to this day that when I play this one, when I hear \\"River Man\\", I have a habit of stopping whatever I'm doing, Drake's voice just compels you to listen.  And he so directly expresses loneliness, fear and sorrow through his music that listening to him can sometimes be difficult for me-- indeed, I only rarely play his music, but when I do, I marvel at it. <br /> <br />But to this record, \\"Five Leaves Left\\" is probably my favorite of Drake's catalog-- the songs are consistently inventive and surprising, and with the exception of closer \\"Saturday Sun\\" (which sounds forced), honest, sincere, and brilliant.  Several of the songs have that quality like \\"River Man\\", \\"Way to Blue\\" can grab you the same way with its pained voice-over-strings.  And \\"The Thoughts of Mary Jane\\" is really beyond words, a sort of melancholy love-from-afar stance, Drake almost sounds content in this, as though the alternative would be too much. <br /> <br />Bottom line, this is a masterpiece, essential listening.  Highly recommended.
B000007MVM|5.0|This is an album that I can honestly say, with all sincerity, is not for everyone.  It is an intimate, dark, and intensly personal sound eminating from a tortured soul.  Though the words are not always revealing, Syd Barrett's emotions are thread-bare on this strangely concieved album.<br /><br />Long gone are the glorious days of \\"See Emily Play\\" when Barrett could simply bop on through a brilliantly concieved mini-orchestra of sound.  Now, rellying primarily on the dark canvass of his solo guitar and sparce (but excellently recorded) drums, \\"The Madcap Laughs\\" seems like the perfect introduction to the man.  But, it isn't where you should start.  His madness is at times frighteningly real.<br /><br />Roger Water's has been accused of sabotaging Syd's work by leaving in mistakes and page turning, but recently people have begun speculating that this was Syd's own idea.  The notion that Syd Barrett was deliberately sabotaging his own career was not a new one.  He played with his own image as the \\"Crazy Diamond\\" until he could do nothing with it, so he left music altogether.<br /><br />This is easily one of my favorite records ever.  I love it more than the Floyd stuff.  However, its an aquired taste.  Although people have tried to duplicate this intimate sounding record, no one has succeeded.  Not really.  Only Syd Barrett, with his unique vision could have a achieved something at once so close and yet so far.
B000025H0Q|3.0|The weakest of the three albums released in his lifetime, \\"Bryter Layter\\" suffers in comparison to what came before (the brilliant \\"Five Leaves Yet\\") and what came after (the sparse \\"Pink Moon\\").  Comparison within the catalog of one's own work is largely inevitable, but here, it can be fatal.    (if you're new to Drake, I'd with no modesty recommend both my review of and the album \\"Five Leaves Left\\" as a superb introduction)    Largely eschewing the baroque/folk of his last record, Drake seeks a jazzier sound, a more varied approach, and some material thats upbeat.  The results are mixed-- songs like the horn-driven, upbeat \\"Hazy Jane II\\" suffer from almost kitchy arrangements and \\"Poor Boy\\" may be the only song on record by Nick Drake that I really quite dislike.  The style just doesn't seem to sit with his voice.    On the other hand, in some ways its the pieces without any of his vocals that may excel the most-- the opener and closer (\\"Introduction\\" and \\"Sunday\\") and the title track all combine a sort of baroque string sound with Drake's folky sensibilities and what almost feels like a Pet Soundsish feel.  And certainly the darker (but still jazz influenced) settings of \\"At the Chime of the City Clock\\" (check the strings after the vocal too-- breathtaking), \\"Hazey Jane I\\", the absolutel beautiful \\"Fly\\" and the stunning \\"Northern Sky\\" (the latter two featuring some mesmerizing playing from John Cale, in particular his delicate viola countering Drake's voice on \\"Fly\\") succeed much better.    YOu know, its a great album, but in my mind, its always doomed to be \\"the worst\\" of Nick Drake's catalog, which is to say its still amazing.  Check the other two first, then come back to listen to this one.
B000002UA0|5.0|Warning:  For the casual listener or casual Floyd fan, this album is NOT another typical Floyd record.  If you expect it to be like Dark Side of the Moon or the Wall, you will be not only disappointed, but dismayed.  The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is a frenetic piece of genius that could only arise from a genuine musical movement.  It is pure Summer of Love power-psychedelia.  Insistant in melody and rhythm.<br /><br />Similtaneously all over the world rock music invented itself in the space of a few years.  Its almost impossible to imagine how quickly this development occured.  From the moment The Beatles appeares on Ed Sullivan in February 1964, rock and roll went into overdrive.  By 1967 we arrive at the zenith of its development from white R&B to an actual voice of its own.<br /><br />Enter bands like The Pink Floyd.  Not content with the restrictions of time limits, musical or lyrical conventions, or even a sensible name, Syd Barrett and company redifine music on this strange, sometimes fun, sometimes scarry debut album.  From its insistant opening space opera track \\"Astronomy Domine\\" until its nearly schizophrenic ending track \\"Bike\\", this album is Syd Barrett's testimony.  If you include his two hit singles, \\"Arnold Layne\\" and \\"See Emily Play\\", then will see why Barrett is still talked about to this day.  His subsequent solo albums after he was ejected from the group, though brilliant, are somewhat more difficult to comprehend to the casual listener.
B000025XKM|4.0|The most popular and probably widest revered of his catalog, Nick Drake's \\"Pink Moon\\" is a stripped down guitar-and-voice record, with only occasional overdubbed piano.  In response to this, the production is much drier than on previous albums, lending a natural fragility to the record rather than the warmth on the previous two albums.  The album has a sparseness to it, emphasized further by its short length, but a great power as well.  I don't think its quite the masterpiece its often thought of as (I'd reserve that for Drake's debut, \\"Five Leaves Left\\"), it is a fine album. <br /> <br />What it excels at is being delicate-- check the instrumental \\"Horn\\", a simpel and beautiful guitar line, or the famous \\"Pink Moon\\" (featured in a Volkswagon commercial) and the stunning \\"Things Behind the Sun\\".  The material is brilliant, its just that there's not terribly a lot of it, and some of it would have benefited from a stronger production and arrangement. <br /> <br />Still, its a beautiful album, and well worth investigation.  Recommended.
B0002X314C|5.0|This is possibly the best R&B album in a generation.  It's not the first time someone has fused hip hop with soul, but this is Kanye West hip hop and John Legend soul.  A heavenly match.  Kanye has always been a fan of gospel and soul samples which makes him the perfect hip hop producer to go soul.  Some may accuse Legend of blatantly ripping off classic R&B singers, but what better influences to have.  I can't remember the last time I heard a R&B album I could listen to straight through without hearing some poppy 'n syncish tune or new jack swing track, but this album delivers nothing but soul track after track.  Even Snoop Dogg can't take the soul out of \\"I Can Change\\".  If you're in the market for a R&B CD this is the one the get.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I wasn't going to buy this CD, until I heard Robert plant (and the Strange sensations on a XM radio program) playing the new songs and mixing em with some old Zeppelin, and it all sounded fantastic. In a one line review I would say this is Led Zeppelin meeting world music. To state more what we have hear is some rock and roll mixed with many other styles and genres of music, played with non traditional and traditional instruments. Plant and the Strange sensation produce a cool sound that's like a dream state. Its mystical and hypnotic and a mystery. The sound is driven and has movement to it, which reminds me of the mighty Zep; but it has a dream like eastern feel to it sort of like unleaded, but I think to a greater effect. The songs are utterly contagious and you will listen to this CD over and over again.
B0001AP12G|4.0|TOO MANY SKITS!  The quality of the songs on this album may still make it classic, but the skits are out of control.  At one point a skit is actually followed by another skit.  I hate to complain about any album with so many great songs, but this could have been one of the greatest albums in hip hop history with just a little editing.  Cut about half the skits and \\"Workout Plan\\" and forget the >> button for good.  Kanye's not the greatest lyricist but an original flow and interesting subject matter like having past due bills while working at The Gap to pay his way through college and facing death in a car accident more than supplement that.  As far as production goes Kanye West has already proven he's possibly the best hip hop producer since Dr. Dre.  I have to complain about 1/3rd of the album being skits, but the truth is it probably is still a classic.
B00005ATQD|2.0|For a long time i've always wandered what made Stanely Kubrick tick. Nearly every movie he's made takes sex, rape and extreme violence to the very limit of what the human mind can stomach. And although films such as Full metal Jacket and a Clockwork Orange show us this, at least they were half decent movies. This however, is just one giant orgy...literally! <br /> <br />There is this one scene for instance, which I still find myself watching over and over to try and understand what made Kubrick think this up. It's the scene where a young woman is completely naked wearing high-heels and laying/hanging off a sofa in an upstairs room of a party. She taken too much drugs and overdosed, and so a doctor is called out. Ok, so it's not the rape scene from A Clockwork Orange, yet it's frightfully disturbing to view.  <br /> <br />Sometimes I find myself thinking...this is art. It's Stanley's way and style, let him experiment with ultra-graphic nudity and sex...he's one of the few directors who isn't (wasn't) afraid of showing the viewer things maybe we would never openly discuss or even think about in our normal lives. Yet the other half of me think...what a sicko! <br /> <br />Ultimatley, not a patch on A Clockwork Orange, which is much more extreme then this is. Full Metal Jacket still his greatest movie. The sad thing is, we'll never see a director's cut to see if the movie can be improved.  <br /> <br />Oh well.
B000002LSV|5.0|If you are a committed ZZ Top fan you will either love or hate this album, which is largely a compilation of their later \\"Eliminator\\"-era synthesized weird blues.<br /><br />I happen to love it, though the digitally enhanced hammering of Frank Beard's drums tends to become assaultive on a fourth listening in the car (my favorite place to listen to the Top). See? There is a place for \\"Rough Boy\\" on this album.<br /><br />Besides the ZZ Top trademark double-entendre-laden anatomy rock of (the remix of) \\"Legs,\\" there's \\"Tush,\\" \\"Tube Snake Boogie,\\" and \\"Pearl Necklace.\\" This collection also features their MTV anthems \\"Sharp-Dressed Man\\" and \\"Gimme All Your Lovin'.\\"<br /><br />ZZ Top is at their best when exploring the growly bordello blues of \\"I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide,\\" \\"La Grange\\" their first real hit, and \\"My Head's In Mississippi.\\" If you're a bluesman (or woman) and unfamiliar with the less commercial side of ZZ Top, this album gives you a taste.<br /><br />The blues tunes are also a counterpoint to the pop-fueled graphic novelettes of \\"Doubleback,\\" \\"Give It Up,\\" \\"Cheap Sunglasses,\\" \\"Sleeping Bag,\\" \\"Got Me Under Pressure,\\" and \\"Planet of Women,\\" all of which are paeans to pure nasty fun.<br /><br />The disc is rounded out by a jackhammer rhythm cover of Elvis' \\"Viva Las Vegas.\\"  Not to mince words, it demands cranking to the tenth notch. \\"Gun Love\\" is an entirely new song. At 18 tracks this disc is a bargain.<br /><br />I think Messrs. Gibbons, Hill and Beard have found the secret to life. Live like ZZ Top...sport your Ray-Bans, grow a beard of biblical proportions, drive a chopped car, wail on fuzzy guitars whenever possible, surround yourself with astoundingly beautiful women, and accept it all as your due. Why not? It's worked for them for 36 years with no change of lineup.<br /><br />ZZ Top. A musical rendition of SIN CITY.
B000002BE9|5.0|If you look back on the second page of reviews, you will see my 2004 two star review. Don't read it; it's wrong. I gave this album a few more spins, because I was desperate for thoughtful lyrics by a solo voice. Fiona is the one. Tidal, a calmer cd than When the Pawn..., is one that I listen to repeatedly now. Not only because the lyrics are astounding and can be linked to so many aspects of life... also because her voice is so soulful and at times calm. The music glides over you like a wave. <br /> <br />My favorite songs are \\"Sullen Girl,\\" \\"Criminal,\\" \\"The Child is Gone.\\" These took awhile for me to get into, except Criminal. The Amazon critic says she doesn't write tangible melodies, but he is wrong. With her beautiful voice, the scattered notes stay in a flurry in your head. It isn't conventional pop or rock songwriting so one can't confine her greatness to a genre.. believe me. Just put the cd in loud in your stereo, and you will hear it. Tidal is a classic. <br />
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I first came across The Arcade Fire one afternoon when I was flicking through the music channels and stopped at mtv2. I saw the video to one of their singles, and was just blown away, not only by the music, but by the highly original video. It was just so inventive and unlike anything I'd ever seen before. I made a note of the name, by visualising an arcade in flames in my mind, because I'm so forgetful with words. I did some research, and bought \\"Funeral\\" about a week later.<br /><br />That was about three weeks ago. This is now. And I am ready to say that Funeral is quite possibly one of the greatest albums I've ever had the pleasure to listen to. There's something quite special about the sound of The Arcade Fire, and I can't quite put my finger on it, but I think that it's a combination of the music and the strong lead vocals of Win Butler. The band employs a vast array of instruments - mainly guitar, drums, and bass guitar - but also piano, violin, viola, cello, xylophone, keyboard, accordion, and harp. With several able musicians, The Arcade Fire takes most of its instrumental diversity on tour, with band members switching instrumental duties between songs.<br /><br />The album opens with the atmospheric \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels).\\" An organ hums gently and strings undulate in the listener's mind as a simple piano melody suggest the unfolding of an epic. Butler gradually describes the tragic scene of his neighborhood, through a voice of uncertain adolescence. As his parents weep in the next room, the boy escapes to meet his girlfriend in the town centre where they plan an adult future. This theme is dramatized through the ever-increasing pace of the song, and continued in the next song \\"Neighborhood #2 (Laïka).\\" Singing of inner turmoil and a sense of introverted suicidal desperation, Butler's vocals ascend through the haze of background voices, the orgy of instruments and a harrowing whistle. The song is foreign and unfamiliar, with violins and strange accordions making for a cultural impact of unprecedented proportions. The next song is \\"Une Ann&eacute;e Sans Lumi&egrave;re,\\" which was written as a sort of tribute to the many family members and friends who died in the process of the recording of this album - hence the album name, Funeral.<br /><br />\\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\" is the main single from the album and in my opinion is one of the best songs of the past few years. The fluidity of the song is astounding, the way it all seamlessly connects one section to the next to form the greater picture. Butler's vocals are once desperate, at times heroic, but always sharp and direct, piercing the song canvas over and over. The racing guitars work in perfect harmony with the sprightly glockenspiel, and the traditional pop beat makes for one hell of an anthem in which it would be a crime to keep your hand from pounding the air in salvation. \\"Neighborhood #4 (Kettles)\\" is a wonderfully atmospheric piece, using the actual sounds of old whistling kettles as an instrument. It might sound pretentious, but it really does work creating the feeling of being trapped in an old Victorian cabin as snow gently falls on the windows. \\"Crown Of Love\\" is a highly melodramatic piece of songwriting, which evokes feelings of Sixties Doo-Wop with the 6/8 string arrangement. One could perceive lyrics such as \\"If you still want me, please forgive me!\\" as slightly tongue-in-cheek, but the fact that Butler is completely and utterly sincere dispels these ideas. The last minute transformation into tragic disco is also a complete revelation; one of the album's highlights.<br /><br />\\"Wake Up\\" is just amazing, undeniably one of the best songs I've ever heard in my short life! The verses are quiet mid-paced and this builds up to the fantastic choruses. The song overall is absolutely incredible, the chorus sways with anthemic glee as you become enraptured in the beautiful melodrama of this stunning album. The break section that arrives at 3:21 is amazing. The female vocals almost make me weep with sheer joy for the beauty of music, loud and triumphant and ecstatic. The next song is \\"Haïti\\" and is a lovely upbeat song that has chunks of reggae thrown in for good measure! The combination of musical styles works incredibly well on this song as Butler's wife, and vocal counterpart R&eacute;gine Chassagne, sings lyrics that will shake your hips and move your lips. The song gradually grows to a halt as \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\" weaves itself in. The steady drum beat controls the entire song right from the world go. Almost like a being rotating on its drum-beat axis, this song is special and refreshing. The piano segments are truly inspirational as the backing vocals seem to rise into the heavens, becoming ethereal and angelic. The album closes with the amazing \\"In The Backseat.\\" R&eacute;gine is at the front of this amazing song. Her vocals are sharp and very tonal, which reflects the ominous piano solo. The lyrics are heart-wrenching and the startling drum roll at 2:14 signals the onslaught of drums that pound into an anthemic crescendo at 2:36. R&eacute;gine has total control over the direction of the song, and although it goes on a bit too long, she sounds the closest to the legend that is Bjork more so that anyone I've come across. And that is no easy task.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />This album is quite possibly one of the best albums I've ever heard, and I'd definitely class it as one of the best debuts. It's not every day a band emerges from Montreal in Canada to blow the cobwebs away that have begun to weave their web across your tired and weary perception of the music industry. I hope The Arcade Fire gain more recognition here in the UK because they are more than deserving of it. This isn't just an album full of great songs, it's an album with an incredible theme and concept. And I'm a sucker for those kind...sheer joy for the beauty of music, loud and triumphant and ecstatic.

B00068CVJ4|5.0|to keep this short and sweet, i think this is one of their best albums yet.  the first time i heard this album i was blown away, and since then i still have to say it is one of my favorite cd's in my cd collection, a must buy.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Super crappy film that not only makes you feel stupid once you have seen it but will make you want to have a drink just to forget about it right after its over. Keanu Reeves is miscast in a very very bad way and the story is not very interesting at all. Certain thing that are introduce in terms of narrative in the beginning of the film is thrown out by the end of the second act in order to put on a ridiculous third act that makes everything about the movie into a bad and tasteless joke. Rachel Weisz does do wonders with the script and her role and the universal praise she is getting is well deserved but she gives the only good performance in the entire movie while the rest of the actors in the film can't rise above the bad material they are given.  I did not even know that this was a comic book before but now that I do, I know why it was so bad to begin with.
B000002H97|1.0|I never decided to listen to this CD because the only song I ever like is Enter Sandman, which that maybe the only good song on this album. I'll give this CD 1 star because I love Enter Sandman and it is one of my favorite 1991 songs of all-time behind Gnr's November Rain, and Dire Straits' Heavy Fuel.   <br /> <br />Anyway the whole CD is a waste until the day I listen to more of the CD.
B0008ENHUI|4.0|Papillon is a safecracker wrongly accused and convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison at a Devil's Island in Guiana, South America. He's determined to escape before he even reaches the island hiding a shiv (knife) and money. While on the boat over to the penal colony Papillon offers to protect the mousey Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman)who's carrying money to bribe the guards for various items once he's at the colony. The two strike up a surprising friendship as Papillon plans his eventual escape from prison.<br /><br />A fine film from featuring strong performances from the unlikely duo of Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman, \\"Papillon\\" isn't director Frankl J. Schaffner (\\"Planet of the Apes\\", \\"Patton\\", \\"The War Lord\\")best film but still packs considerable wallop. The film (for its time) was brutal in its depiction of prison life in the French penal colony system. Supposedly writer Henri Charriere based ont he novel on events from his life although I suspect that much of it is fiction. It's nevertheless powerful fiction.<br /><br />The languid pace of the film may not be to everyone's liking; Schaffner shoots for the pacing (in a sense using pacing to recreate the stifling heat and humidity)of films like \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\". Featuring a number of marvelous performances including Anthony Zerbe as Toussaint the Leper Colony chief and Bill Mumy (\\"Lost in Space\\") as Lariot, it clearly was an inspiration for Stephen King's \\"The Shawkshank Redemption\\" (and Frank Darabont's film).<br /><br />The transfer here appears to be the same one that appeared in the 2000. Presented in anamorphic widescreen, the image quality is still exceptionally good although the image is occasionally soft. There's also analog flaws due to the source print (and, in turn, probably due to the original negative). The film comes with a vintage \\"Making of\\" featurette. It's a pity that Hoffman wasn't asked to do a commentary track as I'd be fascinated to find out about the behind-the-scenes shooting from an actor's perspective. The sound while solid suffers from low volume and sometimes the dialog can be a bit indistinct. On the whole, though, the soundtrack has nice detail and comes across with nice clarity for most of the movie. Remastered for 5.1, \\"Papillon\\" the surround speakers don't get the work out one would expect from a brand new film but the film still sounds nice.<br /><br />Featuring a terrific screenplay by Dalton Trumbo (\\"Spartacus\\", \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\", \\"Exodus\\") and Lorenzo Semple Jr. (\\"Three Days of the Condor\\", \\"The Drowning Pool\\", \\"The Parallax View\\") even if the story is primarily fiction (as is now claimed), it's a powerful drama. Keep in mind that the pace for this epic prison drama is quite slow throughout most of the movie. A bit of trivia is that Dustin Hoffman based on performance of Louis on Dalton Trumbo himself after they met to discuss working on the film.<br /><br />This film is also now available as part of Warner Home Video's superb \\"Steve McQueen Collection\\" which also includes a remastered deluxe edition of \\"Bullitt\\", \\"Tom Horn\\" and a couple of other classic McQueen classics. If you have the previous edition of this classic movie I can't see necessarily upgrading unless you want the snapcase to store the movie in.ctor's perspective.

B0000027RL|4.0|thankyou whats your name for writing your Nevermind vs Ten. <br />But remember music is about making good albums, not whos the biggest best and the fastest. <br />And nevermind and ten were just two albums released in the same year. Simple as that.
B000000WA4|4.0|I'm 12, so I didn't get to really see much of the Smashing Pumpkins. They broke up before I really got into them. But I remember my sister coming home with my dad, with this album with a sun on it. I recently started listening to them, and can't get enough. This band may have had thier sucsess shunted by Nirvana, but could still put together a incredible album. This monstrous title features many big hits, such as the radio hits, 1979, Bullet with Butterfly Wings, and Zero. 1979 is a light, happier song, while Bullet with Butterfly Wings is gritty and tough. Zero has one of my favorite guitar riffs in the beginning, and inspired me to play guitar. Some of the less known songs leave thier mark as well. Tales of a Scorched Earth, one of the crunchiest, distortion-ridden songs in thier history, is great. I am also unduly impressed with James Iha's guitar playing. Examples, during Bullet with Butterfly Wings, near the end, a really cool wah-wah pedal effect under the main rythm. <br /> <br /> <br />This was thier biggest sucsess, and really pushed thier name onto the market. It's a dissapointment that so many bad things happened to them at once. <br /> <br />I give this a 4/5, only because some of the songs get repetitive and don't do much for me. But the majority are inspiring and thought provoking. <br /> <br />I reccomend this album to anybody, especially grunge/alt. fans and any 12 year old that dosen't listen to bad music. <br /> <br /> <br />-Ian Mills, 12 year old Critic.
B00097A5I6|1.0|Well thankyou Oasis for all the hype but no thankyou, as far as anyone \\"should\\" be concerned, this is by far the most horrendous and unbearable album to date, and never before have Oasis compeltly lost it, they have now. <br />Every single song on this album is bad, and they are a stupid enough to try and recreate old 1960s rock n roll, instead of creating a revolution or something excting like they used ot do. <br />The production is terrible, sounding like it was forced to sound un polished, not one stand out track, and liams singing is so whiny and awful its unbearable. <br />The biggest dissapointment in the history of music.
B0008ISM40|5.0|If you are a lover of NINs earlier works only this may not be for you. I love the innovation and surprises in this album! Only is one song that I just can't get out of my head!
0618001905|4.0|This book is the story of the conquest and exploitation of what the part of Africa that became known as the Belgian Congo. In the last part of the 19th and the first part of the 20th centuries, it was technically an independant country administered by Belgians, and basically owned by the then-King of the Belgians, Leopold II. He is presented in this book as a ruthless, greedy, essentially heartless individual who exploited Central Africa for his own gain, and ultimately got away with most of the atrocities that were committed in his name. <br /> <br />This book is a recounting of his conquest of the region, and of the international protest movement that it provoked, which ultimately led to the King selling the whole region to the Belgian government in 1908. The principle motive for most of the atrocities was financial gain: the region was a rich source of ivory, and when the European explorers got into the interior they discovered another resource that turned out to be better than gold, because it grew and replenished itself: rubber. This discovery coincided with the explosion of the automobile, the airplane, and other technological innovations that required rubber, large quantities of it, to work properly. The Congo turned out to be one of the principle sources of this. <br /> <br />The author goes over the various methods of extracting this resource from the country (most involved coercion of some sort, because it was cheap) and then spends a great deal of time (perhaps slightly less than half the book) discussing the campaign to stop the killings and the worst of the excesses that were involved in the gathering of the rubber. The movement centered around a former employee of the shipping company that was in charge of shipping cargoes to and from the Congo, who noticed that all that was going to Africa was guns and ammunition, and that a lot of rubber was returning, along with ivory and other items. <br /> <br />This guy's name was E.D.Morel, and he led a movementthat was largely composed of missionaries, though he himself was almost an atheist in beliefs. The missionaries included several black Americans who lived in Africa for a long period of time, and were witnesses to at least some of the atrocities. <br /> <br />This part of the book is interesting, and the author clearly is very interested in what Morel's motivation was. He also brings other characters into the equation, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Roger Casement, and Joseph Conrad. Conrad, of course, wrote Heart of Darkness, apparently wrote the story basing it in part on the Belgian Congo, which Conrad visited once while in the British Merchant Marine in the 1880's. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book a great deal, though the author does have a bias against the perpetrators of the atrocities. This is the sort of thing that is frankly frustrating: how objective do you have to be when writing about Hitler or Stalin. The author makes it clear that the killing wasn't genocidal: the only motive, for the most part, was theft. It was, however, brutal, nasty, and unfair. The author clearly is biased, and this shows a bit in that he actually implies that the German invasion of Belgium during World War I, which caused famine and hardship for much of the country, was at least partially deserved because of the atrocities in Africa. Besides that, though, the point of view is seemingly well-founded. <br /> <br />I couldn't say I enjoyed this book: it's hard to read about a mass-killing and enjoy things. On the other hand, I found the boook to be interesting and informative, and I definitely would recommend it.
B0007OCG4W|2.0|What does this movie have? Great actors who perform their roles to the best of their ability. What does it lack? A compelling script. Therefore, the overall result is not good at all, because no matter how hard Portman, Roberts, Law and Owen try, there is nothing they can do with the dull and overly depressing script they have to work with.<br /><br />The story starts when Dan (Law) meets an extroverted New Yorker in London. Alice (Portman) used to work as a stripper in the Big Apple and ran away looking for a new start. A relationship starts building, but when Anna (Roberts), a professional photographer, crosses their path, things start to get complicated. And when Larry (Owen), a dermatologist, finds Anna as the result of a prank played on him, the four characters get entangled in a web of relationships that gets boring fast and drags the movie into a limbo, in which it remains until the end.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the only aspect of this movie I consider to be praiseworthy is the acting, but for someone that is looking to be entertained for a couple of hours that is not enough. I think Jude Law deserves to be recognized, especially after he was made the target of aggressive jokes at the Oscars, and in this case he shows once more his gifts for acting. It is a shame the script is so bad!
B00000634J|4.0|John Lennon was one of the most innovative rock artists of the era.  No one sounded like him, and no one wrote songs like him.  This album does a great job of capturing Lennon during all phases of his solo career, from the raw therapy of \\"Mother,\\" to the slick sappiness of \\"Woman.\\"  Ironic that the man who mocked McCartney for his \\"silly love songs\\" would one day write the same.  This album has all the hits, including \\"Instant Karma,\\" \\"Give Peace a Chance,\\" \\"Imagine,\\" and \\"Jealous Guy.\\"  The compilation even manages to include three songs from the less accessible \\"Plastic Ono Band\\": \\"Mother,\\" \\"Love,\\" and \\"Working Class Hero.\\"  If you want to hear the raw side of Lennon that separated him from other singer/songwriters, including Dylan, check out \\"Plastic Ono Band.\\"  You'll see where Cobain learned how to channel his rage.  If you're looking for the hits, this compilation will suffice.
0316172324|4.0|Blink kept me engaged in its stories and got me thinking about things I never gave much thought. I also went to a web site that he had mentioned and it actually worked! I recommend it especially to anybody who's job requires them to make split second decisions.
B00097A5I6|4.0|(a) First of all the album has three killer tracks.... Love Like A Bomb.. Bell Will Ring... Importance Of being Idle... I dont dispise any of the songs besides their first single lyla... let there be love is a cool song... a cool video could make it even better... so is mucky fingers (great lyrics).... meaning of soul is cool but short... i really like guess god thinks im abel... but the rainbow lyric is something im not fond of yet... keep the dream alive is cool and a grower... rest of the albums pretty good...     (b) All the songs on the album are strong and well produced... and mostly upbeat...  (c) This is their 3rd best album.... FOR THOSE WHO DONT realize there was an album before whats the story morning glory... maybe you should check out the greatest debut album ever... DEFINATELY MAYBE (raw, aspiring lyrics)    (d) this is their 6th studio album... my ratings for the albums are Definately Maybe (10)... Whats the Story (9).... Be Here Now (6)... Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants (6)... Heathean Chemistry (3)    (e) Ringo Starr's son drum's on the new album    (f) there is much more to oasis then their studio albums... great live show... great b-sides .. especially in the 90's.... check out the lyrics to songs like fade away... and round are way... and... masterplan!!
B000929AJQ|5.0|I bought this on the release date and was not sure what to think. As usual it takes several (as in more than 4 or 5) listens to get a good grip on an album. No doubt, this is no Downward Spiral or even The Fragile. But it is NIN and Trent and that means it is better than 98% of the stuff out there. Be in a strange mood and decide to listen again. That is the test. You'll appreciate what he does to counter the world of mostly crappy music - he gives us something that is definitely above the majority of the rest. Realize that every day is exactly the same.  <br /> <br />Now I'm off to listen to Further Down The Spiral. No other artist inspires me to spend money on a remix. That says it right there.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Great follow up CD to the Fragile. The addition of Dave Grohl on some tracks sounds amazing. Nice job Trent. Next time let's not wait so long between discs.
0375703861|5.0|when she wrote this. amazing. that's all i have to say.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Great follow up to what I feel was one of the best albums top to bottom that has been released in the 90's. More than just a fad, I hope these guys continue to make music together for a long time. Songs on this disc are a little milder and have less of an edge than the debut. They show the progression of a group that has a lot of talent. Chris Cornell continues to reinforce the notion that his name has to be put in to disscussion whenever rocks top vocalists are mentioned. Tom Morello is so easy to identify with just a few notes that I'm surprised he is not copied more. Saw them in concert last month. Great show. Acoustic Black Hole Sun and Spoonman with that Rage guitar were the highlights. Hearing Cornell singing \\"Killing In The Name Of\\" <br />and not Zach is still a little wierd. If Zach was smart he would tell the guys from Limp Bizkit to dump Fred, and they could start their own supergroup.
0060977493|5.0|and being a Keralite myself, i can tell you the characters in this book are my entire extended family. ive never read anything as beautifully written as this novel, and i hope one day Roy will gift us with a second fiction novel.
B000002MTR|5.0|I'm not agree with the guy downstairs.I think this is the last good album made by Rhcp.The most pleasant thing is that the best songs are not strictly commercial.Then Rhcp realized that that kind of stuff they were playing was not enaugh commercial,so they hadn't the balls to go ahead with a more interesting project. <br />By my point of vieuw the best songs are the most noisy-as Warped,One hot minute,One big mob,Coffee Shop,Transcending are really interesting-the worst the sweetest ones,as My Friends,Aeroplane,Tearjerker,etc.- <br />I think also that this is the last pretty songs made by Dave Navarro,who just the year before made his best work at all,Deconstruction.Then he did So What! and Kettle Whistle for the 1997 compilation Kettle Whistle by Jane's Addiction,after these ones definitely he became a cartoon. <br />
B000002UTY|3.0|Well I will go against the current here. I listened and owned the original LP and this CD is missing the all important \\"...take another hit of fresh air\\" which I miss and should have been included in this CD! Who wants to buy a \\"Best of\\" CD, those are just not the same. Too bad as this was one of the best LPs in my former collection.
B000002U82|4.0|Dark Side of the Moon is certainly not Pink Floyd's best album, yet every album is fabulous; I prefer Meddle, Piper At the Gates of Dawn, and Saucerful of Secrets over DSOTM.  Still, I had to write a review to dispell some of the lower ratings this album has recieved.    First off, none of the four members did any drugs outside of alcohol and cigarettes.  Syd Barrett was the only illicit drug addict in the band, and they dumped him years before this album was recorded.  Also, it really shouldn't matter.  Piper At the Gates of Dawn, as well as Barrett's solo work, is fabulous stuff.    Second, every song on this album is great.  It is a concept album, as most of the Floyd albums are.  Actually, Pink Floyd essentially created the concept album, with artists such as The Who and David Bowie following suit.  The music and lyrics are true genius, the performance clean and emotional, and the timing impeccable.    Lastly, the experimentation with electronically produced sounds and music on this album is not only magnificent, but helped pave the way for electronic music of all types, from disco to funk to house to breakbeats etc etc.    Pink Floyd were innovators that are merely misunderstood by many.  Any true music lover will at least recognize the contributions made by this band and their influence on countless bands and producers today.
0385337388|5.0|I read this book while recovering from a spinal fusion several years ago.  I'd had my surgery at a large teaching hospital and read it to pass the time while I was hospitalized.  Every resident, intern, fellow, etc who walked into my room seemed a little un-nerved to see me reading this...but I thought that maybe if I kept them on their toes, the'd keep me on mine. <br />As an MRI/CT Technologist, daughter of an RN, and sister to a pharmacist, I could relate to the experiences in the book.  This should be a must-read for all medical personnel!
0671027344|4.0|This book was simply about a boy too mature for his age, struggling to find his identity in his freshman year of highschool. The book is composed of letters to an anonymous reader, and they contain his innermost struggles and feelings. In getting to know Charlie, we find that he is a very strong character, who only needs someone to listen to him. Throughout his journey, he learns of the hardships of love, the strength of true friendships, the stupidity of drugs and alcohol, the realism of sexual molestation, and the true love that comes with being part of a family. It's a very good book, and I would highly recommend it to anyone of the more mature audience.
6304913176|3.0|Loosely based on the Heinlein novel, \\"Troopers\\" follows the weirdly lucky \\"Rico\\", a soldier in the army of the future.  In the clean world-of-tomorrow, with mankind having extended his reach across the galaxy, his only obstacle are the arachnids, a vicious insect race that seems to act mindlessly yet can travel through space by shooting spores like rockets. Lacking any technology, Arachnids can wipe out armies, bring down the mighty starships of the federation, and even launch huge asteroids at man's most heavily populated worlds. Slowly but surely, the federation realizes that the bugs aren't a mindless infestation that will allow itself to be exterminated, but a calculating enemy that must be wiped out. With their greater numbers and lower regard for any life (including their own) the bugs take the upper hand, and the only extermination that man can now envision is his very own.  <br /> <br />The great thing about \\"Star Ship Troopers\\" is that Director Paul Verhoeven, makes the extinction of man plausible and yet funny.  With his reach approximating an empire maintained by huge starfleets and vast armies, mankind adheres to a philosophy of \\"might-makes-right\\". With Verhoeven's signature multimedia narrative clearly illuminating a society in love with its own power, we may even wonder whether the bugs are fighting in defense against an implacable enemy that simply had it coming.  <br />Early on, we meet Rico in high-school, where he (and us) learns the political realities of our future - in which only a select few have the right of citizenship.  The arachnids are already a threat, but not yet an enemy when Rico graduates high school and volunteers for \\"Mobile Infantry\\".  Soon the situation changes and mankind realizes it's at war against hordes of merciless killing machines.   <br /> <br />\\"Troopers\\" is good, yet never becomes great.  It's fun to see Verhoeven's dark-themed future, in which mankind seems to be skating cheerily on the edge of fascism (the clothing styles, inspired by German WWII militaria, drive the point home), yet it's never quite as biting as the similar \\"RoboCop\\".  The CGI is nice, but never spectacular - the flick seems to have imagined a future looking little different than something from the 80's \\"Buck Rogers\\" show.  None of the characters stand out, and much of the action is episodic.  That said, the flick manages to toss us some surprises - like Clancy Brown as a mechanically homicidal drill instructor, and Michael Ironsides as Rico's no-nonsense boss.
B00082IJ08|4.0|Dub reggae, a form of reggae rich with deep bass and claustrophobic atmosphere, is probably one of the only forms of niche music never to reach a massive popular peak here in the states, so it is no surprise that it has found its way into the mass popular medium anyway through avant bands like the Gorillaz. Demon Days shoulders Dub pretty well, through good mixes with other genres like house electronica, new wave, and hip-hop, and topped with lithium-spiked vocals. All this is done with an almost orchestral flare, and it is no wonder that by the end of this disc, the feel of the music overall changes from a dancable beat to a beautiful piece about a tribe angering a monkey god, or something. That kind of silliness takes away from the beauty of the music, but, oh well.
1576751988|5.0|I love Brian Tracy's straight to the point writing.  This material is not rocket science, and he puts it all out there in front of you in an easy to understand format.  Its such an easy, fast read!  My problem was that I wanted to highlight half of this book!  Get the book, it will really change your thinking, and then DO what he says, it works!
B00005JNTX|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Frank Miller's and I loved this flick. I'm not going to waste time and space ranting about it. However, I will say this: DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! Yup, you heard me. Let me say it again: DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! It's a single disc with no real extras to brag about. Sin City 2 is slated for release in 2006. That's when they'll come out with the new \\"Special Edition\\". They're trying to get your money twice; don't fall for it.
B0000048V8|5.0|I first saw The Snowman twenty years ago, just after I started school. The almost wordless story captivated me and when it snowed a few weeks later I built my first snowman - sadly, it didn't come to life! <br /> <br />The film's shown every Christmas on Channel 4 here in the UK and on watching it as an adult it's almost as much fun as it was back then. The quality of the animation and attention to detail is simply stunning, especially on the flight sequencies - from the middle of the English countryside, flying southwards over the Brighton Palace Pier of all places, then along the Channel, northwards over the North Sea to Scandinavia and up into the high Arctic. <br /> <br />There are lots of small graphical touches as well, such as the \\"Kung Karl Hotell\\" that appears briefly on the way back, not to mention the ever present snow... <br /> <br />And the ending still haunts me to this day - I remember as a child being ever so upset at the end of it all, despite it being the inevitable fate of every British snowman!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|this cd was good, great music, but the lyrics were so weird, lol. expecially in Violent Pornography and Cigaro. None the less this album was good. but common we all know Toxicity was there best album.
B00007KWHN|5.0|Ok, I am listening to \\"The Yes Album\\" for the first time in many years - in digital format, no less - having been on a little bit of a \\"break\\" from certain kinds of music. It's just so long one can go before they start craving music bordering on other- worldly... at least that's how it is for me.    The Yes Album is my favorite Yes album. With the addition of Steve Howe to the line-up, the band seemed to take on a different energy and form. There is no disputing that Howe was an \\"up-grade\\" in the guitar dept. for the band. But, he seemed to bring with him a different direction that the band sorely needed. I did not know this - if not for the liner notes included in this expanded edition - but, the band was on the verge of being dropped by their label. Howe may very well have saved them from such a fate - and all of us from being deprived of Yes music as we all know it today.    The line-up on \\"The Yes Album\\" represents my favorite Yes incarnation. I like the line-up which added Howe, but retained Tony Kaye on keyboards... and with Bill Bruford still on drums. On this album, Yes still has that \\"jazz-folk-rock\\" feel. With the up-coming loss of both the band's more jazzy influences (Kaye and Bruford) within the next 1-2 years, Yes would lose that original flavor in their music and move towards a more \\"classical\\" rock (aka \\"Progressive Rock\\") feel. That's cool... but \\"The Yes Album\\" is THE one and only example of what I view as the definitive Yes sound. Arguable? Of course. But, this is MY review.    \\"Your Is No Disgrace\\" is a heck of a track to kick-off the album with. One of my favorite songs by Yes..... Steve Howe's \\"The Clap\\" was one of those tunes that made me both want to throw my guitar in a dumpster, as well as continue to try to develop my playing further.... \\"Starship Trooper\\" is another of my favorite Yes tracks. Not unlike The Beatles' \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", or the Beach Boys' \\"Good Vibrations\\", \\"Starship Trooper\\" is, at times, not so much a song as adream-like state..... \\"All Good People\\" was one of those tunes that first attracted me to Yes in the first place..... \\"A Venture\\" is a great song with some neat piano work by Tony Kaye, and cool bass runs by Chris Squire.... and \\"Perpetual Change\\" - what can I say about this song other than it is a brilliant piece of music. Everything is going on in that song in just the right amounts.    I've yet to hear the bonus tracks, but they don't appear to be anything to get too excited about. The studio version of \\"The Clap\\" will be cool, for sure.    Yes's finest album recorded by their finest line-up.
B0009I7NOO|3.0|The old Oasis is gone people, lets face it. Their first two albums can never be surpassed. They peaked in 1995 and 1996. Every other album there after has been sub-par at best. I still buy each of their albums but there never as good as the first two.
B000001EGE|5.0|This is my favorite Elton John album. It was also his first U.S. No. 1 album, and the first time he used his touring band of Nigel Olsson (drums), Dee Murray (guitar) and Davey Johnstone (bass) as a recording unit.<br /><br />Along with lyricist Bernie Taupin, Elton presents a joyous--even fun--collection of songs.  Even when the subject is suicide (\\"I Think I'm Going To Kill Myslef\\"), the music is upbeat. You have to love a song with a tap dance solo! [Favorite line:  \\"If you want to save my life/Brigitte Bardot gotta come and see me every night.\\"]<br /><br />Of course there were the hits:  \\"Honky Cat\\" and \\"Rocket Man.\\" But each song bristles with energy, like \\"Hercules,\\" \\"Amy\\" and \\"Susie (Dramas).\\" Of course, there are a handful of ballads, like \\"Salvation\\" and \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\" just to mix things up a bit.<br /><br />In addition, Elton tried some new things on this album.  Electric violinist Jean-Luc Ponty is brought on board for a couple tracks (\\"Mellow\\" and \\"Amy\\"). And in addition to playing guitar, Davey Johnstone plays banjo on \\"Rocket Man\\" as well as mandolin on \\"Mona Lisa and Mad Hatters.\\" And there are no drums on this latter track. The only bonus track is an absurdly fast version of \\"Slave.\\"<br /><br />While Elton would go on to have even bigger hits and better selling albums, this is the one I return to time and again.

0312330529|5.0|Robert's novel, Shantaram, is an exceptional work. It will touch you deeply. This book sparked weeks worth of conversation in my home on subjects as diverse as herion withdraw, cultural diversity, \\"The wrong thing for the right reason,\\" and the strength of the human spirit. It is a must read and I highly recomend the title be first on your summer reading list.

0793518326|2.0|I purchased this book mostly to take advantage of its piano transcriptions.  First, I would like to point out that this is a Hal Leonard publication-- most people that have purchased other Hal Leonard sheet music know its accuracy can range from somewhat decent to downright silly.  Keeping that in mind, this book's results are not surprising; like many Hal Leonard arrangements (key word 'arrangements,' this book did not come from the pen of George Martin, folks), it is riddled with inaccuracies, shortcuts, slurs, fudges, inconsistencies and inattention.  To name two, \\"Lady Madonna\\" is farcical at best, and \\"Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da\\" is written with the wrong chord voicings and the second piano trill at the end is purposefully incorrect.  On the other hand, the intricacies of the harpsichord solo from \\"In My Life\\" are well-captured-- hence the mixed results.    People attempting to read the lyrics from this book on the fly will possibly have trouble with the small, italic-looking font.  The Coda symbols are very small.  Drum notation in the center of the page can appear squashed by the vocal measures that begin the following line (there are two lines of music per page).  There is also some stupid notation for all the instruments where they didn't feel like printing the notes on a measure that are identical to the measure before it-- instead, they slap a funky symbol in the middle of the measure that you're supposed to know implies \\"repeat previous\\" rather than just printing the notes in again-- even if, for piano players, only one of the two hands is identical to the previous measure-- as if it is easy to read unparallel measures.    But here's the good stuff.  First, the sheer number of songs (all Beatles songs ever released, in alphabetical order rather than chronological, which is good) makes it more worthwhile than any other Beatles songbook.  Second, for people that are stuck with piano/vocal/guitar-type books of Beatles music, this will be an improvement, because most other collections are so horribly dumbed down and/or transcribed into incorrect keys that it makes this one look like an authority, but upon very little examination, you will see it is by no means completely accurate.      My opinion is that this book is merely supplemental if you're looking for 100% accuracy.  It is best used to bang out the basic song structure, but if you're looking for perfection, you'll have to figure it out faithfully by ear.  I doubt anyone will ever publish a truly accurate Beatles score book-- it is simply too vast an undertaking-- so your own two ears are ultimately your best resource.  This book is in the stadium, but if you want to get on the playing field, you'll have to do it with plenty of careful listening.
B0009AM5JA|5.0|This much anticipated album does not disapoint.  Coldplay delivers another album with 13 awesome tracks.  With rap music taking over the airwaves, Coldplay reminds us just what real music is with X&Y.  If you liked their first single, Speed of Sound, you'll love evey other song.  White Shadows has a much more upbeat tune, much like Clocks off their second album, A Rush Of Blood To The Head.  Fix You and A Message are very mellow with the use of the accoustic guitar, while Speed Of Sound and The Hardest Part rely on the use of the piano.  With Chris Martin's smooth voice bringing everything together, Coldplay can do no wrong.  Although the piano is not present as much as in previous Coldplay albums, the sound is still overall better than Parachutes or A Rush Of Blood To The Head.  No cd collection or iPod will be complete without this album.

B000000W5L|5.0|If THEIR SATANIC MAJESTIES REQUEST was the Rolling Stones' SGT PEPPER, EXILE ON MAIN STREET is their WHITE ALBUM.  Originally released as a 2-LP set, these 18 songs serve up the Stones' version of the blues.<br /><br />The album kicks of with the one-two punch of \\"Rocks Off\\" and \\"Rip This Joint,\\" before shifting gears with the Slim Harpo song \\"Shake Your Hips.\\" While some double albums would have improved with some pruning, there isn't a weak track here.  Other highlights include the hits \\"Tumbling Dice\\" and the Keith Richards vocal \\"Happy,\\" along with the country blues of \\"Sweet Virginia,\\" the acoustic \\"Sweet Black Angel,\\" the hyperspeed \\"Turd on the Run,\\" and the gospel-tinged \\"Shine a Light.\\" This is the Stones' masterpiece.

Gorillaz must be happy living high on the hog with the money of their fans, at the same time as encouraging them to \\"reject false icons.\\" The hypocrisy of it makes me want to invent my own stupid fad just to make money, but I'd rather be poor than purposely make myself look like a freak. <br /> <br />To conclude, \\"Demon Days\\" is a silly album. That's all. Silly.
B000000OUJ|5.0|One of hip-hop's finest lyrical works, and the beats are dope too. You dont have to like hip-hop to like Liquid Swords. The GZA is called the GZA for a reason, he is a genius. From start to finish this is an amazing album, it has an incredible replay value.

John Lennon is one of the best vocalist,Paul and John could write very intersting lyrics. The Beatles changed rock n roll, and without them you wouldnt have most of the music you have these days.

038572179X|4.0|Until I read Atonement, I thought the critical praise given to Ian McEwan's novels exceeded his actual accomplishments.  Amsterdam, which won the Booker Prize, was cynical and amusing, but slight in its aspirations.  While Enduring Love contained the finely wrought prose for which McEwan is justly praised, the novel itself seemed overdetermined, its ideas about modern relationships force-fed into the hearts and minds of the characters.  McEwan, like his contemporary Martin Amis, seemed to be a fine prose stylist capable of making acute observations about modern life, but only partly successful at grounding those observations in the lives of specific characters.  In Atonement, though, the characters are fully realized, and the work finally lives up to the critical hype.<br /><br />On a beautiful early summer day in 1935, a young English girl on the cusp of womanhood (Briony) lets her imagination overwhelm her judgement.  By the end of that day, close family ties are irreparably severed, and a promising young man (Robbie) has his prospects destroyed.  The rest of the book tracks Robbie's attempts to recapture the grace of his life before the fall, and Briony's attempts to atone for ruining his future.<br /><br />The book starts out with minutely observed tracings of the main characters' thoughts.  We feel plunged into something resembling a Virginia Woolf novel. (Later in the novel, McEwan pays sly homage to Ms Woolf.)  The languid pace picks up in the middle section with powerful scenes of English soldiers in retreat to Dunkirk during the early days of World War II.  The final section occurs almost 50 years later.  We see how Briony, now an old woman, has reconciled herself to the events she set in motion during that fateful summer day.<br /><br />The novel is ultimately about the power of imagination, how it can be used for destructive ends, but also how it can be used to heal and console.  McEwan leads us to consider whether our ability to imagine a better world that the one we actually inhabit makes the pain and turmoil of this one easier to bear.  Briony concludes that positive acts of imagination are great gifts that our writers bestow on us.  The penetrating psychological insights, pitch perfect prose, and magisterial view of human foibles and aspirations on display in Atonement are great gifts from McEwan to his readers.ly inhabit makes the pain and turmoil of this one easier to bear.

B00000612Q|5.0|On NEVER A DULL MOMENT, Rod Stewart did not stray from the formula of the hugely successful EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY.  This is another stunning collection of Faces-style rockers, British folk and soul.<br /><br />The album kicks off with the raucous \\"True Blue,\\" which is the only track to feature all of his his Faces' mates.  The other two Stewart/Ron Wood-penned songs are the folk rock of \\"Lost Paraguayos\\" and the rocker \\"Italian Girls.\\" The final original is \\"You Wear It Well,\\" co-written with guitarist Martin Quittenton, his collaborator on \\"Maggie May.\\"  While \\"You Wear It Well\\" topped the U.K. charts, it only reached No. 13 in the U.S.  The other single (No. 40) was a touching rendition of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Angel.\\"  Other covers include Dylan's \\"Mama, You Been on My Mind,\\" \\"I'd Rather Go Blind\\" and Sam Cooke's \\"Twistin' the Night Away.\\"<br /><br />While Stewart would go on to bigger commercial success and superstar status in the late-Seventies, EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY and NEVER A DULL MOMENT are the twin pillars of his career.  If you ever wondered why the critics were so unmerciful when he recorded songs like \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\\" it's because they remembered what an amazing singer/songwriter/interpreter he could be.

6305090564|1.0|Director:  Stephen Sommers <br />Cast:  Treat Williams, Famke Janssen, Kevin J. O'Connor, Anthony Heald, Wes Studi. <br />Running Time:  106 minutes. <br />Rated R for violence, gore, and language. <br /> <br />A deep-sea crew coincidentally stumbles upon an abandoned underwater vessel and is then ripped from limb to limb by a huge, flesh-eating monster.  Sound familiar?  The original \\"Alien\\" formula has been beaten to death for over twenty-five years, but directors such as Stephen Sommers and screenwriters like...Stephen Sommers (hmmm...) seem to believe that something new can come from the same old outdated, overused, and underperformed formula.  Treat Williams stars as the head of a group of modern day, underwater pirates who accidentally lurch upon a vacant luxury liner in the South Seas while searching for some goods to steal.  What they find instead is much more than what they bargained for. <br /> <br />The sensual Famke Jannsen stars as a thief and con artist also aboard the ship, but even her flare cannot save \\"Deep Rising\\" from sinking.  Director/writer Sommers attempts to add some humor (especially with the highly talented Williams), but this attempt falls overboard.  The special effects are only halfway believable, the acting is atrocious, and the script is laughable, all the while using every clich in the book.  A complete waste of nearly two hours.  If you're a huge fan of fake digital monsters, over-the-hill action stars who think they are funny, and huge explosions--check out \\"Deep Rising\\", but also check into a mental institution. <br />
B000003TAW|5.0|People think Weezer's a bunch of emo kids trying to be rock, but thats not true. Just because the lead singer has glasses doesnt make him emo. I remember when I 1st heard this album from my friend Ashley. She was obessed with Weezer, I only liked a few songs but then again I really wasnt paying very much attetion to it. Then later on as I got older(now 15), I was making a radio station on yahoo, and when I played it Weezer was on. I listened to and loved it right away, then I went out and brought the CD when I was at the races. I loved every song on this album. This would have to be one of the best Weezer albums ever. \\"Buddy Holly\\", \\"The World Has Turned and Left Me Here\\", \\"Sweater Song\\", \\"Surf Wax City\\" are there best songs ever. You should check them out if you havent heard much of this band.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This is a record whose subtle strokes of genius take time to assimilate, but once you're there, you're *there*.  The best comparison is to the Pale Saints' The Comforts of Madness, but even that'd be a strain.  Essentially, Avril Lavigne's Under My Skin is without peer, not only because of its sheer brilliance, but because Avril dares to write the sort of music that was relegated to the bargain bin over a decade ago.  Her innovations are startling, if initially inaccessible: she makes My Bloody Valentine's \\"Glider\\" seem like \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" in the unbelievable \\"Freak Out\\" - a song that can only be properly described as a \\"sea of sound.\\"  In \\"My Happy Ending,\\" she cleverly mixes a Stonesy rhythm with soaring, ethereal harmonies that are truly breathtaking in their stark, naked beauty.  I could rave about this record for hours on end, but the only thing you really need to know is that this is a landmark album.  Unlike so many other artists who plod along merrily, churning out record after record of mediocre material, Avril set out to write something that was truly *great*, and, without question, she did just that.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|I got home late last night, but made it in time to see most of the concert. I thought it was great. All those guys still have their voices although I sensed that Glenn Frey was holding back a bit. There were some really high notes in the originals that he just left out altogether.  Also, a couple songs sounded like they were in lower keys. Being a guitar player, I really missed Don Felder. He was without question the best guitarist in the group. Joe Walsh is great, but seemed to be holding back too. The new guy (Felder's replacement) pretty much just played a Strat all night except for a 12-string double neck on \\"Hotel California\\". He did a great imitation on that song, but the rest of his work was not really remarkable. I also noticed that he didn't sit with the big 4 (Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Joe Walsh & Timothy Schmitt), but was placed way over on the right. He also was not included in the final bow at the closing. Too bad. And I especially missed Don Felder's intro to \\"Hotel California\\" which they did with a trumpet instead of the original acoustic guitars. I also think it's a shame that they did not give credit or include 2 of the founding members, Randy Meisner (\\"Take It To the Limit\\"), and Bernie Leadon who did all the banjo work in the early days. They did a new song, written just for the show, but it left me pretty flat. Completely un-Eagles sounding and I don't think it will ever become the hit that their 1994 reunion song became. (\\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\").     So I had really mixed emotions about it. They're still the best 70's country-rock band alive today (IMHO), but I wish they could put their petty personality differences behind them and do a complete anthology that includes all the former members. I don't know about you, but hearing \\"Take It to the Limit\\" without Randy's voice, sounded dull and lifeless.     6/16/05 -  Ok, so I was wrong about Steuart Smith.  The DVD arrived last night and a got to see the first half of the show that I missed before.  And I have now changed my mind about Don Felder's replacement.  I guess I was just upset because Don wasn't there and annoyed that they had cut the incredible intro to \\"Hotel California\\" that Don wrote.  But I have to admit that Steuart really is a first class guitarist, even if he does spell his name funny.  I was quite amazed, when trying to find the steel guitar in some of their early tunes, to find out that Steuart was doing it on a Strat-like solid body.  Really good stuff.  So please forgive me for reacting so rashly in my first review as I now consider this DVD to be every bit as good as \\"Hell Freezes Over\\".  But I still think that if Randy couldn't do \\"Take It To The Limit\\", then they should have left it out.  Bill
B00097DX3U|5.0|This was the best new cd that I heard all year until I landed a copy of Coldplay's new one which, being just about on par with their first two albums is virtually untouchable.  Sorry about raving about Coldplay in an Audioslave review but they are making the best music out there now and deserve all of accolades that they get.  That said, Out of Exile is probably a more fun record to listen to, doubly if you're a zeppelin fan as Tom Morello's guitar sounds incredible on every song on the record.  Chris Cornell's voice fits in realy well with the musicians fromg from Rage, and if you listened to this album without knowing who made it you might think it came from the golden ages of rock, the early 70's.  A couple of songs on the album sound quite similar, but since they are similar-sounding good songs there is absolutely no need to skip any.  In short, I liked this album even better than the first Audioslave release and, mark my words it will be viewed as a classic rock album in years to come.

B000002JKA|5.0|After hearing many positive things from friends about Dream Theater, I decided to get one of their albums. This is my taste of Dream Theater and I have really enjoyed this cd. Normally, I'm not a big fan of this vocal style but since the songs are so good and the singer does such a good job, I was hooked. This album is rather long but all the songs are really well done so it didn't bother me. Now I am looking forward to Dream Theater's upcoming release and I will be sure to look into some of their other albums. Overall, if your looking for some good prog music then look no further. Amazing melodies, incredible musicianship, and great vocals make this one worth getting.
B00097A5I6|3.0|It took a few listens before I got used to the new Oasis. Oasis has done much better stuff previously to Don't Believe the Truth, but after a few listens, the cd did not seem as badly as it had before. Don't Believe the Truth is very different from Heathen Chemistry (their last album), but much better than Heathen was.

B00003003R|4.0|Guns n' Roses, although disbanded(we all know Chinese Democracy isn't coming out), were still able to release a 2 disc Live album, stretching from concerts from 1987 through to 1993. However, this release does not represent a live musical representation of all of their albums, as it features no music from their final album, The Spaghetti Incident?<br /><br />Beginning with Disc 1, it might be the choice as the heavier album, featuring alot of the metal tracks that made GNR famous found on Appetite For Destruction. Kicking off with the explosiveness of Night Train, it is a consistent disc, with highlights coming from songs like Mr. Brownstone, You Could Be Mine and It's So Easy. Overall we get to hear some nice live cuts, and of course Welcome To The Jungle is a highlight. Most of all, Disc 1 just plain rocks. The real highlight though is maybe Axl Rose's superb rendition of Black Sabbath's It's Alright, playing it on the piano with an excellent interpretation of it. November Rain closes this disc out nicely.<br /><br />Disc 2 starts off on with an ugly, vicious rocker in Out Ta Get Me, beginning with that awesome guitar riff. Pretty Tied Up on here is excellent, and superior to the studio recording. Move To The City is a fairly strong track, and You Could Be Mine is an intense, drum felt rocker with Axl screeching the lyrics into your ears very well. Rocket Queen is a classic, and we get a pretty strong live excerpt of the song. I don't think any of their live performances of that song will ever match the original recording itself though. Sweet Child O' Mine expresses the sensitive side of GNR in live form, with that guitar hook singing into your ears perfectly. Don't Cry is a strong track, and was a highlight performance for GNR on their Illusion World Tour. The outstanding Estranged version can also be found on a GNR DVD, and it is a very heart felt song, and Axl displays his passion for it in the performance. Paradise City closes nicely, always a classic.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty solid 2 disc set featuring some great live excerpts. The only flaw is the price, set so you're paying about a dollar a song(more living in Canada), while you probably already have these songs on a CD in their original form. I would recommend it to GNR fans who aren't careful with their money like myself, and diehards.pretty solid 2 disc set featuring some great live excerpts.

B000006TRV|3.0|I feel that this is the most overrated. The Wall certainly has a lot of fans; many who like to think of the album as a work of art. It certainly wasn't helped by the animated movie \\"the Wall\\" which has had drug crazed teenagers obsessed spannning over the generations since the time of its release. I'll say this much first; to me, the Wall does not sound like Pink Floyd. Floyd reached their pinnacle with Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, and Wish you were Here. Animals was a great release, but it showed a slight deviation from the typical Floyd sound in favor of a heavier rock oriented album. Still, it was very solid, the Wall however, reminds me more of a Roger Waters' solo album. The band as a whole lacks the cohesiveness that was present during such masterpieces as Dark side of the Moon, and Waters is pushed to the forefront, limiting the talents of Gilmour, Mason and Wright to being little more than simply a backing band. Yes, I know that Gilmour contributes vocals and some song writing, but the bands overall chemistry is lacking.  <br /> <br />As far as the songs go, there is far too much filler on this album. The Wall is a perfect example of Roger Waters' ego expanding and culminating in an overproduced, self indulgent \\"magnum opus\\". Outside of a few gems, the Wall is very ordinary, and the songs are bland. Comfortably Numb is a great song, and Run like Hell, Young Lust are definately standouts. But a couple of songs do not make an album, much less when its a double album, there is just too much fluff that is not only unnecesary but completely absurd. I'd prefer not to spend 30 bucks listening to Roger Waters rant and complain about the isolation faced being an nihilist rock star. Maybe I am not smart enough to comprehend the \\"art\\" behind this album. It certainly lacks the subtlety of DSOTM or WYWH, I'd give it 3.5 stars at best.
B00000634J|5.0|John Lennon was a genius not only for his songwriting but for what he done in the 70s-80s. All John wanted was peace and he got it, he didnt want fights or wars or anything like that. John Lennon was a pure genius at the things he done before his death in 1980. John Lennon is one of the world's best singer or person in that fact. If you liked The Beatles, you will love John Lennon at his finest works.
B00000JCB2|5.0|This album has it all. Angry blaring songs like \\"Break Stuff\\" to the cooler , more mellow ones such as \\"Re-arranged\\".  I love this album.  I still play it all the time.  I've loved Limp Bizkit when they were real popular back in the day and I still do.  I don't care if people think im uncool because of the music i listen to.   <br /> <br />Overall I recomend buying this album.  You will not regret it.
0767840135|5.0|After my parents having gone to Treasure Island to see Mystere, I knew I would really enjoy a Cirque performance, based on their reactions to the show.  I ordered a package through Columbia House, with Quidam and Dralion both.  Quidam has a storyline that is more elaborate, and developed (in my opinion) than Dralion.  After watching it repeatidly, I am still amazed at how many nuances I can pick out that I had never noticed before.  Without going into specifics I would say that the theatrics and acts are coordinated beautifully, juxtaposed to the weaker story of Dralion, which seems to focus mainly on the acts.  Surely Quidam is a must-see.
B00001R3GI|5.0|Without getting too wordy in expounding upon the virtues of The Stones' masterpiece known as Exile On Main Street and why it deserves the credit it has been given by rock critics and fans as hands-down being among one of the all-time greatest albums of the rock & roll era as many Amazon reviewers have already done so ad nauseum/ad infinitum --I couldn't possibly put into words any better than so many others previous to me-- I would just like to say that this album is a shining example of what a motley band of tax fugitives can accomplish when they have time to kill and are at the fullest command of their respective talents.  The criteria I employ when rating an album's greatness relies not so much upon individual tracks in and of themselves, but rather I prefer to focus my judgement on the cohesiveness of the album as a whole, evaluating the individual tracks that comprise it on their own merits but also in how they interact with and interrelate to the rest and how the subtle --or not so subtle-- interplay in shifting or echoing moods and tones from song to song shape the overall mood and tone of the album.  From start to finish, Exile is a flawless collection of some of the greatest rock & roll songs ever composed without a dud in the bunch to speak of.  A great record when it was released more than 30 yrs. ago, Exile --I, incidentally was born while this albim was in midst of being recorded-- like a fine wine only betters with age - a truly great album, indeed.
0060958324|3.0|In his now classic Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig brings us a literary chautauqua, a novel that is meant to both entertain and edify. It scores high on both counts. <br /> <br />Phaedrus, our narrator, takes a present-tense cross-country motorcycle trip with his son during which the maintenance of the motorcycle becomes an illustration of how we can unify the cold, rational realm of technology with the warm, imaginative realm of artistry. As in Zen, the trick is to become one with the activity, to engage in it fully, to see and appreciate all details--be it hiking in the woods, penning an essay, or tightening the chain on a motorcycle. <br /> <br />In his autobiographical first novel, Pirsig wrestles both with the ghost of his past and with the most important philosophical questions of the 20th century--why has technology alienated us from our world? what are the limits of rational analysis? if we can't define the good, how can we live it? Unfortunately, while exploring the defects of our philosophical heritage from Socrates and the Sophists to Hume and Kant, Pirsig inexplicably stops at the middle of the 19th century. With the exception of Poincar, he ignores the more recent philosophers who have tackled his most urgent questions, thinkers such as Peirce, Nietzsche (to whom Phaedrus bears a passing resemblance), Heidegger, Whitehead, Dewey, Sartre, Wittgenstein, and Kuhn. <br /> <br />In the end, the narrator's claims to originality turn out to be overstated, his reasoning questionable, and his understanding of the history of Western thought sketchy. His solution to a synthesis of the rational and creative by elevating Quality to a metaphysical level simply repeats the mistakes of the premodern philosophers. But in contrast to most other philosophers, Pirsig writes a compelling story. And he is a true innovator in his attempt to popularize a reconciliation of Eastern mindfulness and nonrationalism with Western subject/object dualism. Themagic of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance turns out to lie not in the answers it gives, but in the questions it raises and the way it raises them. Like a cross between The Razor's Edge and Sophie's World, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance takes us into \\"the high country of the mind\\" and opens our eyes to vistas of possibility.
B00002RAOU|3.0|Bay of Blood's not a bad movie, but yeah it does have the same thing as Friday the 13th. But only this movie has more of a real graphic, when the young girl's head is chopped off. It wasnt like most horror movies with blood just going everywhere, or fake bones inside, it looked so real. The movie wasnt so bad, better then most movies.
B00004XOWM|4.0|This was a pretty good album by Limp Bizkit. This album was the peak of limp's success.   <br /> <br />The songs were well writed except there was way too much profanity.  I dont mind hearing \\"F-This\\" or \\"F-That\\" every now and then but Fred over did it a little.  They didn't need to curse so much to be successful because \\"My Way\\" and \\"Boiler\\" are great songs with minimal cursing.  <br /> <br />Every song on this album is worth listening to.  My generation and Rollin are real good hits.  As is \\"Getcha Groove On\\".  I normaly hate it when bands associate with rappers but this is the one case where ill make an exception.  The vocals and beat couldn't be any better. <br /> <br />The only downfall to this album is the overused profanity and they went a little bit on the softside, breaking away with 3 Dollar Bill. <br /> <br />Overall i recomend this to people who dont mind frequent use of profanity and who like good frat-boy rock.
B000055ZB8|4.0|Yes, this is a fine version, but there are obviously serious translation problems with this DVD, some even affecting the narrative Murnau intended.  For example, in the 34th minute, commentator Lokke Heiss tells us that Murnau is playing the text against the visuals by having written \\"Hutter had heard her [Ellen's] call of warning\\" as the text. The intertitles however on this DVD though don't say this at this point; instead we read \\"her soul had heard the call of the deathbird.\\"  So ... which is it?  Heiss was certainly watching a different version from this one when he did his commentary track.<br /><br />Another drawback to this version is that the English text seems almost childish at times - with a language as rich in terror adjectives as English is, couldn't the translator do better than resorting several times to \\"creepy?\\"<br /><br />Nonetheless, Heiss's comments really are expert (but could anyone explain how, if vampires cannot cross moving water, the Count appears as a hyaena to check on Hutter at the inn across the river?).  Perhaps the best component of all in this DVD version is Heiss's tour of the original exteriors used in the film; his showing us what the original \\"Nosferatu\\" sites look like now is a superbly original, considerate feature that any hardcore fan will appreciate.
0452282152|3.0|It was a quick read but kind of ended flat.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|We rate this movie less than 1 star. Don't waste your money or your time on this movie. The movie cover claims to be \\"hilarious\\", yet we're still waiting, no, have given up waiting for the hilarious part, or anything more than a slight chuckle or two. If you must see the movie, rent it from the library where you won't have to spend a cent, because it's not worth the money or the time.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Okay, just relax you Star Wars-movie-viewing cult. You are probably ready to jump down my throat, so just calm down. I am pretty mad right now too. You see, when I was younger I never happened to catch The Star Wars like so many of you did. Sure, I was aware of it quite a bit, and had heard OF it a lot. As a kid there were plenty of times when bullys would punish me whith wiffle-bats that they pretended were light-sabers, and I would always get drafted to play a Speeder-biker or an Ewok when everyone else got to be main-characters. Obviously these things left a bad taste in my mouth about the Star Wars. I started getting my parents to buy me the action-figures and vehicles, and that brought plenty of kids over to my house, and people THOUGHT I had seen it because I had quite a collection.  <br /> <br />So when I finally saw some of the novels at the library, I gave-in and picked up the first in the series. It completely captivated me and made me realize exactly what was going on, and I didn't even HAVE to see the movie. I moved on to the next 2 books shortly after, and now reading them has become a yearly tradition for me. I was enthralled by the Socio-Political struggles and the in-depth character building so much in fact that I began to realize something. That something truly this special would be significantly weakened by condensing them into 3 ridiculously short Hollywood-style movies. The concept of these movies is just laughable to me that they would even TRY something like this. I therefore established \\"The Star Wars Movie Boycott Movement\\".  <br /> <br />You see, when I read the novels I have very vivid pictures of what certain space-ships, monsters or planets look like, and the best part is that I can imagine whatever actors I want playing the main-characters. I obviously imagine myself as Luke because I feel that I really capture the character well (especially in the 3rd book). My best picks for the other characters is how I visualize Han-Solo as being Patrick Swayze. He has that dashing charisma that the character MUST have. I imagine Darth-Vader's voice as this guy Lance I know who is a real bully-type just like the character. Another one I have is harder to explain but I will try. I chose my dog Morris to be Chewbacca, but now he is 8 feet tall and can stand on 2 legs. If an element of the story is too hard to imagine, that is the ONLY time I will accept an out-side influence and refer to my action-figures.  <br /> <br />Do you see what I'm doing here? I am able to personalize the story, whereas you can only imagine it how the movie tells you it is. I can now enjoy the story far more, and on so many more levels than you can. In conclusion, I know that quite a few of you have seen these movies, so I guess it's too late for you to imagine what is actually possible. The people I am trying to get through to are the people that are looking up this DVD because they don't know if they should see it or not. The answer is NO. Buy the books instead, and save yourself a ton of money in the proccess, and imagine it how YOU want to. Not greedy Hollywood movie-makers. Join me in \\"The Star Wars Movie Boycott Movement\\" if you want to realize the true power of the Trilogy. You can show your bravery by actually signing-up for the movement on my web-site.  Later.  <br /> <br />howardtuttleman.com/antiswmovement.htm <br /> <br />
0375704027|5.0|\\"Norwegian Wood\\" is a classic coming of age story occurring in the sixties Japan. The main character, Toru, tries to find righteousness amidst the craziness of the first years of college. His relationships with women will define his character while he strives to make the right decisions.<br /><br />The story is sweet, melancholic, and fairly simple read. You want have any problem following the story through the streets of Tokyo, through student riots, mental institutions, and backpacking trips in rural Japan. More than anything else our Toru is trying to find his place in the world. That's why I don't think anyone will have trouble relating.<br /><br />The language is very pure and simple. Symbolism that satisfies your mind and soul are found from beginning to end. So, if you have never heard \\"Norwegian Wood\\" by the Beatles do it before you read this book. And also buy some old Miles Davis to go as background music. Hell, if you want to go all out you might as well fill your flask with your favorite kind of malt liquor to sip while reading.
B00005JLEU|5.0|If Bilbo had a human cousin, it would be Chihiro, a sullen girl who, a la Bastian in THE NEVERENDING STORY, falls into a dangerous world that reminds one of Jim Henson's \\"Labyrinth.\\"  Like Sarah, Chihiro, initially sullen and refusing to accept change (a move to a new city), must rescue loved ones, in this case her parents, from a mysterious all-powerful magician and shape-shifter, the demon Yubaba (who would get along famously with Aku from \\"Samurai Jack.\\")  Like Jareth in \\"Labyrinth,\\" Yubaba takes the form of a bird and seems obsessed with babies, in this case her own.  Chihiro must find a way to disenchant her parents after they eat the sacred offerings for the spirits and turn into pigs a la THE ODYSSEY.  While Chihiro's parents blithely muck about in the pigpen unaware that they may be turned into bacon, Chihiro gets work at the bathhouse with a boy named Haku and a girl named Lin, who makes Chihiro seem like Little Miss Sunshine.  Clearly, Yubaba's never heard of child labor laws.  She doesn't mind torturing frog- and slug-people who work at her \\"high-class\\" bathhouse for spirits and dmeons.  But Yubaba's own baby...ah, that's a different story.  But Yubaba's baby seems to like Chihiro...<br /><br />Chihiro doesn't know who to trust--the boiler-man Kamaji?  Lin?  Haku, who Lin says is \\"Yubaba's henchman\\"?  Chihiro is forced to confront a world outside her own small existence, and in doing so releases the true beauty of her spirit, particularly when she helps the wounded Haku in dragon form.  \\"What's going on here?\\" Lin asks.  Kamaji replies, \\"Something you wouldn't recognize.  It's called love.\\"  But even Lin begins to come around, scolding a mysterious spirit called No-Face: \\"You lay one finger on that girl, you're in big trouble!\\"<br /><br />The visuals of the bathhouse transport the audience to a truly wondrous world.  Get \\"Spirited Away.\\"
0790729628|3.0|There is one review on this site that says the movie isn't particularly good, and this review received 26 negatives and no positives.  That is the biggest flaw in the Amazon system of rating the reviews.  If you didn't like a film, any film, you are going to get negatives, because the people who are checking out the reviews are people who like the film.<br /><br />I rented the movie because it appeared on Time's top 100 movies of all time.  I thought it was all right, but not great.  It didn't move me the way it moved other reviewers.  I suppose that means that my own review will be slammed.  But I'm just being honest here.  The movie didn't move me much at all.  The only saving grace is that another of the reviewers said you need to see it more than once to get the impact.  The problem is, I don't want to see it again.<br /><br />One point I'm confused about.  Is Deckard a robot?  I'm not sure.  Are they leaving it to us to decide?  I don't like that.  Tell us.  It's your movie, so tell us.<br /><br />The problem goes a bit deeper than that.  I don't really care much if Deckard is a robot.  Deckard didn't involve me enough to care.  The only character I found myself giving a damn about was the robot who didn't know she was one, the one Deckard kissed.<br /><br />I think viewers are looking for different things out of movies.  I want a movie to reach me, to make me feel something.  Harrison Ford was dry as a martini.  The replicant robots that he was hunting were lukewarm as well.<br /><br />If this is your favorite movie, good for you.  The simple fact is that it didn't do much for me.  That's my honest reaction.  The only time you are appreciated for criticizing a movie, any movie, is if you are criticizing the picture quality or something, not the movie itself.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I've been a Mariah fan for quite some time, and while each album has brought its own gems, this is the most solid record she's done.  Despite collaborating with various producers, the overall sound and trackflow is seamless.  Mariah lends her songwriting to several genres, but keeps the sound complimentary to the other tracks on the album.<br /><br />Another impressive aspect is the background vocal arrangement.  They're often so complex that they're like seperate songs in themselves.  Listen closely to \\"Circles.\\"<br /><br />The vocal energy is so high and visceral, that I can't help but groove out everytime I listen, especially to the Ripperton-influenced \\"Stay the Night\\" and \\"I Wish You Knew.\\"<br /><br />This album is great for parties, belting out with, and the songs are going to be incredable live.  Even if this is your first MC album, you'll get into it.

B00097A5I6|1.0|As a dedicated Oasis zealot for 12 years, it brings me great regret to write this review.  I would have gladly paid the $10 I spent on this packaged product to obtain the 5-track 1994 live demo that accompanied it.  As for the 11 track, 43 minute follow-up to \\"Heathen Chemistry\\", I feel that Oasis has sadly failed to produce a product worthy of an opening act to any of the burgeoning calvacade of Manchester acts exploding right now.  It's a piece of poorly produced audible crap, and fails miserably on a variety of scores.  Noel will shoot himself for delegating songwriting duties on this. <br /> <br />I summarily refuse to waste your time with a discrete song by song review.  After reading Stephen Thomas Erlewine's glorious, ill conceived review (probably band-compensated for [...]) of this CD and my best friend's anxious notes of it, I sat anxiously to review it tonight in depth.  To anyone intimately acquainted with Oasis' songwriting style and sound production, this entire CD rates worse as a whole than any of their previous efforts.  Each song is a droll, unproductive drum & guitar strumming accompanient to immature and overly repetitively penned lyrics, no doubt to Noel's mental anguish, by other band members (Liam, stick to the mic & drinking).  \\"The Importance of Being Idle\\" and \\"Let There Be Love\\" were the only two tracks on the entire CD that gave me hope that Oasis had some modicum of creativity left. <br /> <br />Ultimate blame lies primarily with the production team for the porous and extremely bland sound, and the balance with songwriting.  \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" was no masterpiece, but a quick review of it following this sonic cacophony will reveal a time when Oasis actually still had some juice left.  The final liner note photo of the band against the setting sun is terribly fitting since this 11 track soliloquiy should be their epilogue. <br /> <br />As a hardcore Oasis fan, this effort has left me feeling empty & depressed.  Granted, nothing will approach the expertise and mastery of \\"Definitely Maybe\\" and \\"What's The Story, MG\\", but this CD is a palty effort to even put forth an effort more worthy than \\"Be Here Now\\", which at least had two great tracks on it.   Anyone who thinks \\"SOTSOGiant\\" or \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" are lesser than this new album are either neophyte Oasis fans, or severely different in their interpretattion of this once unreal band.  I highly doubt \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\" will pack the punch Oasis badly needs it to in order to stay in league at the Glastonbury Festival.  Let's all pray that they rely heavily on their previously heralded fan favorites for the bulk of the setlist for their impending world tour.  Else they be prepared to reap the painful whirlwind of commercial doom that Oasis has invited with this CD. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor.  Buy \\"Familiar To Millions\\", \\"Be Here Now\\", any other Oasis studio CD or some other worthy Manchester band music to remember the good times.  The golden days of Oasis are dead for now and cast in salty concrete with \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\".
B00007G1ZM|5.0|Personally, I think \\"Mildred Pierce\\" should be shown every Mother's Day on network television as a simple reminder of where mis-placed Mother's love will take you.  Joan Crawford found out the hard way in this 1945 noir-soaper cranked out by Jack Warner under the guidance of Michael \\"Casablanca\\" Curtiz.  Curtiz was a genious to realize that you have something unique when you figure out how magnificent and wide Joan Crawford's heartbreak can be when she gets to suffer in deep-sleeved Sable. And who could suffer in bathing \\"key light and shadow\\" better?  Simply, Curtiz uses his leading lady to perhaps her greatest effect.  Her \\"Mildred\\" is the lumber and nails of this production.  On equal acting footing is hissing Ann Blyth squinting like a dangerous, devouring reptile dressed up like a Madame Alexander doll.  Together they chew some of the greatest dialogue ever afforded any actress.  \\"Mildred Pierce\\" is a cinematic artichoke with witty, biting and clever layers yielding to a diseased heart of unrequited paternal love.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I just watched the concert on NBC using my High Definition TV broadcast, and 5.1 surround sound audio.  It was absolutely terrific.<br /><br />Every member of the group  sounded great.  Don Henley looked a bit heavy, and older, but sounded just fine.<br /><br />If your favorite Eagle is Joe Walsh, this is the concert for you.<br />He sang more on this concert, and was great as always.<br /><br />This concert contained almost every one of their hits, and left out a lot of their lesser known materials.  Don Henley mentioned in some of his commentary that they don't mind at all doing their hits, even though they've performed them hundreds of times, and in fact thinks they've improved the songs and their performances over the years.  I agree.  In my opinion, this is a better concert than Hell Freezes Over, and that was very good.<br /><br />How many bands can you name that have a country sound and are as popular with rockers as well as country, and have been around over 30 years?<br />Update:  Finally on blu ray.  I thought it would be impossible to improve, but here it is.  The blu ray version sounds and looks even better.  I've watched this concert many times.  I never get tired of it!<br /><br />Just great!!!  By the way, the video and sound quality are top notch.<br /><br />Jerry
B00006690G|4.0|Eminem isn't dark like on his last album but he still is amazing on this album. This album is amazing and as good as his last to albums.

0385513755|5.0|This is a great read!  The subject is intriguing, the characters engaging, the action is exciting, the mystery well plotted and fairly laid out...the whole thing is just well written and worthly of all the acclaim it has received.<br /><br />Robert Langdon (ANGELS AND DEMONS) finds himself involved in yet another exciting adventure that puts him at odds with established religion.  He is soon on the trail of a 2000 year old conspiracy that takes him across Europe pursued by the usual bad guys intent on his demise.  What elevates this from the usual thriller type novels that populate airport book kiosks is that Brown has written this one so well.  There's layer upon layer to this mystery, imaginative and well researched which makes this one just fun to read.<br /><br />Much of the controversy surrounding this has centered on its attack on established religion.  This is a work of fiction, a work that does have some basis in fact (the horizon line in the Mona Lisa isn't level) but a work of fiction all the same.  Anyone who's faith is threatened by this book has bigger problems than this book.<br /><br />Read this book and ENJOY!  The illustrated edition saves a lot of time looking things up, and is just great to look at in anycase which adds to the experience.
0385720920|4.0|This novel is very much about alienation... from mainstream economic life, from mainstream relationships, from mainstream thinking. By day, the hero, Victor Mancini, works a minimum wage job at a run-down colonial-style theme park and by night, he runs a complicated scam to get people to donate money to him so he can pay his mother's nursing-home bills. He's a sex addict, quite incapable of seeing women as anything other than sex objects with an attitude. His best friend is a fellow loser at the theme park. <br /> <br />If you've ever felt like a huge loser, if you've ever felt like raging against the endless demands and dullness of economic and social life and felt like you're on the outside of the fishtank looking in - this book is littered with gems of pop philosophy that you can connect to.  <br /> <br />One example of Palahniuk's insights:  <br />\\"Even addiction, she said, was just a way to treat this same problem. Drugs or overeating or alcohol or sex, it was just another way to find peace. To escape what we know. Our education. Our bite of the apple.\\" <br /> <br />Another: <br />\\"The Mommy, she used to tell him she was sorry. People had been working for so many years to make the world a safe, organized place. Nobody realized how boring it would become.\\" <br /> <br />Often, the philosophy is presented in repetitive, mantra-like patterns through the book, giving a poetic flavour. <br /> <br />4 stars from me because it just did not flow very easily somehow. Also, it was too long for the amount of substance it contained. Too many time-killing, meaningless interludes - even if one major theme of the book is meaninglessness.
B000002H97|5.0|No one calls this Metallica's \\"self-titled album\\"...this is the Black Album! There are some albums that simply live on forever and bridge generations of music lovers. \\"The White Album\\"...\\"Pet Sounds\\"...\\"Hotel California\\"...this is another one. There are so many great songs on this CD, songs that even casual Metallica fans can recite on cue: Enter Sandman, Nothing Else Matters, Sad But True, The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam...does it get better? Earlier albums were harder and the later albums were perceived as \\"softer\\", but this was the album where it all came together and took Metallica from underground to full-on mainstream.<br /><br />To those who think Metallica \\"sold out\\" by making videos and cutting their hair: shut up. If you were an artist and had that much cash thrown at you to do videos and huge tours, you'd do it. Get over it.

B0008G2IRO|5.0|This album has so much depth and texture that it seems to get better each time you listen to it. I can't help to compare the feel of this album to Future Sound of London's 'Dead Cities'. It has the same apocalyptical undertones with a dash of odd sensuality here and there. Danger Mouse was the perfect producer for this trip hop driven album. I was slightly dissapointed with the Gorillaz 1st self titled debut but now my faith has been restored. Continue going forward in intelligent music making Gorillaz because compared to all the crap thats out there you are truly the 'last living souls' of music left. I felt that some of the rap could have been lost on \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" which makes a fantastic track just average and banal.With the genius song writing of Damon Albarn and the various collaborations notably DJ Danger Mouse ( WTF is Dennis Hopper doing on this ?!?) this cd is imo the best album of 2005 hands down.
0800196341|5.0|This is a must see for Shakespeare fans and students alike.  Branaugh did an excellent job with this production, and deserves much credit for not diluting the characters through selective deletion of the more lengthy segments.  While his laments are a very little bit overdone on one or two occasions, his portrayal of the anguish of a sensitive prince robbed of his father and his destiny is impeccable.  I've watched it through five times, and appreciate it more with each viewing.  Many people have been waiting for this to appear on DVD for a long time - preferable given the length of the film, and a move that would save it from becoming obscure in the next few years.

B00097A5I6|4.0|With Oasis' new effort I was curious whether they would attempt to keep moving forward with their music, or simply reach back to their roots for prior success.  Well, they did a little of both, and rather well too. <br /> <br />For example, this album, more then any since \\"What's The Story (Morning Glory)\\" seems to return to that love of the Beatles; this is a resounding feeling with Oasis.  However, Oasis realized a little while ago with their decline in popularity (and common sense) that they'd never match the fab four, so they've also added their own to the mix, which is of course necessary, but also quite fine. <br /> <br />`Lyla', their first single, strikes the listener clearly with the hooks and overall melodic feel.  This is a single, so one must not forget that it is meant to be catchy (and succeeds).  However, for songs that might not get as much notice \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel\\" is probably the best.  The song is the epitome of that Oasis-Beatle combination I mentioned, and really a great listen. <br /> <br />So with nice sounds, both instrumental and vocal, I believe that \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\" will be another steady and good album for Oasis.  Unlike Heathen Chemistry this disc has a lot less just `rock'.  However, it also has a lot more classic Oasis, although still not completely progressing (or regressing) to the times of \\"What's The Story (Morning Glory)\\" or \\"Definitely Maybe\\".
B00097A5I6|5.0|I've loved Oasis since the beginning. Who would have thought that British-guitar-pop would have provided a welcome breath of fresh air from the \\"I'm so sad in my gap flannel shirt\\" 90's music.  Matured & assured enough to share the writing credits amongst themselves-it's how this band should sound in 2005.  Theres not a throw-away in the bunch.  If you have not listened to Oasis in awhile, nows the time to get back in.  For the faithfull, you wont be dissapointed.  Even at their weakest musical moments, they still rule over most! Buy it!
B00097A5I6|5.0|I want to make this short and sweet.  This album does not deserve the five-star rating I gave it but it also doesn't deserve anything less than a four-star rating so I gave it a five to make up for those people who are giving it a one-star or two-star rating who probably hate Oasis anyway and haven't even heard the new album yet.  If you like Oasis, buy the album it is not W.T.S.M.G but it is worth getting.
B00080ZG1A|5.0|I watched this last night and loved it, the movie pulls you in and takes you along for the ride. You would think this would be a really long movie by looking at the running time (169 min) but it's not at all, it fits perfectly in place and you never go through a boring moment. Buy the DVD if you haven't, it's definitely worth a watch.

B000009EAD|5.0|Iced Earth is one of the greatest metal bands ever. They are one of the most exciting acts I have ever heard. Something Wicked is their best release, especially since the vocalist is way better than Ripper. Too bad they turned down the Gigantour, I was thinking about going to that. The best songs are 1-5, along with the rest of the album, these tracks just stand out more than the others. For fans of Maiden and such like-minded bands.
031286504X|2.0|This novella is sloppy, vague, and suffers from poor editing. It's unreasonable to call this work a classic of any kind. Matheson is loose with his details: within the first couple of pages, we have a main character in the 'afternoon' sunlight, enjoying his 'mid-morning drink.' Strange duststorms spread vampirism-causing bacteria worldwide. But what exactly does the bacteria do? It kills people; or rather, it turns recently-dead people into vampires; or rather, it kills people and within a few days it turns them into vampires; or exactly what does it do? Matheson never makes it clear. A significant point of the plot is that there are two main categories of vampires: those who were already dead, and turned into vampires by the bacteria, and those who were infected by the bacteria while alive, and turned into 'living vampires;' the two types have different behaviors and weaknesses. But Matheson is inconsistent; some 'living vampires' act like 'dead vampires' and vice-versa. Matheson never clarifies how the vampiric bateria differently affects living and dead people, even though this difference is key to the story. When Matheson tries to give a scientific explanation of how the bacteria works, things get ridiculous. Matheson confuses whether he's talking about a virus or bacteria, and his pseudoscientific description of how the disease works is weak, even for 1950s science. (One way he describes the destructive effect of the bacteria is by saying that the bacteria enter cells, then soak up so much water that the infected cells explode. Huh?) Apparently, as this strange disease swept the globe, no one was clever enough to look at vampire blood under a microscope (until Neville thinks to do it, years later). The vampire/zombies also display an inconsistent intelligence. The female vampires are smart enough to use sex to try to lure Neville to his doom, yet none of the vampires can manage to use a doorknob. About six pages of this book involved Neville trying to make friends with a wandering dog. Neville tries to take care of his health, since there are no more doctors or dentists, but he shatters enough bottles and glasses in his house to coat its floor with two inches of broken glass, quite a health hazard. Early in the book, Neville is ethically torn: is it right for him to go about during the day, killing sleeping vampires? After all, they're somewhat human. But late in the book, Neville blatantly says that he never hesitated to kill any vampire, which both contradicts his behavior early in the book, and removes a layer of his character's depth. What exactly does the vampire bacteria do? How does it differently affect the living and the dead? Why does it affect 99.999% of the population, but not Neville? How does Neville go about his business for three years in Gardena and its environs without noticing a huge 'new society' of hundreds (or thousands) of people in Inglewood? The allegory of a 'normal' man becoming the 'monster' is an effective conceit, as it emphasizes the subjective nature of what is 'normal' in society, but that point is tacked on to the end of the tale. In the course of the story, sometimes paragraphs don't follow each other logically, and it confuses the reader. This story might be significant in its influence and historicity, but it's not written well, and it's barely entertaining.nds with a wandering dog.

0345455681|4.0|Given its length (1000+ pages) and subject matter (history of London), you would think you'd be in for a dry, detailed slog of a read appealing strictly to non-fiction lovers and/or history buffs. <br /> <br />At first, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the telling of history was achieved through light stories using the crafty device of tracing the trees of several families, beginning with the Celtic Duckets at the time Caesar's armies invaded. <br /> <br />By the end, I was longing for more depth to the characters and a little more meaning and substance to the stories.  Only one character could really be considered tragic - a poor girl who lives the hardest life imaginable - and she appears about 3/4 of the way through the book.   <br /> <br />My point is that, on the one hand, the lightness of the stories provides a welcome reprieve from what could be dry and dull history lectures disguised as a novel.  On the other hand, the lightness of the stories, for me, meant that I was craving something more substantial from the book. <br /> <br />Overall, I enjoyed it immensely because I love history and I love London.  After I read the author's credits of the Museum of London, I felt a bit cheated after I then visited the Museum of London and discovered that its exhibits and features mirror almost every chapter in the book - it's as if the author saved himself research work by using the Museum as a crib sheet to frame and fill in the historical details of his story.  Small quibble, but my feelings nevertheless.
B000063DFN|4.0|I too bought the leatherette-textured LP the summer day it came out, so this is part of MY wave as a listener, you pups!    The concept jacket deserves attention - here we get the first Maiden \\"formula\\" record - really contriving Eddie in a different motif for each record ('let's go Egyptian this time'\\"lets time travel this time') and ending the record  la \\"To Tame A Land\\" with a really, really long song. \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" while a cool song does feel much more forced than \\"Hallowed\\" or \\"Tame a Land,\\" songs which epically finished off previous master-works. \\"Alexander The Great\\" on the one to follow SLAVE proves my point - the \\"obligatory long song\\" was no longer an epic wind-up, but just chugged on without a lot of purpose except... being really really long.    So thematically they started operating on formula, and the Maiden Machine was set in motion.    I found POWERSLAVE while not as punky shoot-from-the-hip as BEAST was nonetheless more spontaneous/energetic and \\"live\\" than the heavily contrived (albeit very good) PIECE OF MIND. That's one distinguishing feature of SLAVE. It doesn't sound like the drummer is thinking about every note so carefully, and Nicko is much more free and expressive here than his debut with the band. The rest of the players also seem more comfortable and loose, and I'm hearing less over-layering than on PIECE making SLAVE closer to their live sound.    So it's a looser record in that way and also a less focused record, song-wise. \\"The Duellists\\" sounds like an unfinished song or a re-hash of \\"Where Eagles Dare.\\" \\"Flash of the Blade\\" has a brilliant chorus and break, but the verse section leaves me wanting. The album intro and a few other areas don't totally work, and the perfectionist in me wishes they'd have tweaked some of the tuneage.    I'm nitpicking. This is Maiden 1984, an extremely capable and successful hard rock band, probably still very giddy in their youthful metal-doings. To me a solid focus on songs did not really return until SEVENTH SON, 3 albums later - and THAT record is just downright refined, progressive, mature, ARTY for metal, whereas POWERSLAVE still traces their earlier off-the-cuff style of music - a bit.    Sonically this was at the time the band's cleanest recording yet although many feel the vocals get swallowed in the mix, and Bruce's voice is half the reason to appreciate this band I feel.    So I am/was a little disappointed with SLAVE, only because of my high expectations of the band's vision (they could have been as epic as Rush). SLAVE is still a massive rock milestone with plenty of great material, and it must be heard still today.    So you get what you get with Maiden, they've both evolved and wandered astray, they've had hits and misses but they were always (and still are) a REAL band,  and this is MAN's music, stubble and all.
B0009I7NOO|4.0|This may not be Oasis' best album ever, but definitely better than Heathen Chemistry, and maybe even the best since (What's The Story) Morning Glory! Don't Believe The Truth may not blow you away on the first listen, but give it time. Listen to it some more, and it could easily grow on you! It might be slightly different than what you'd expect from Oasis, but it's still a great album and an improvement for the band!
0393324818|5.0|...we need to find space for Michael Lewis' \\"Moneyball\\" <br /> <br />This deservedly sits on my shelf alongside books by Kahn, Halberstam and Angell. <br /> <br />A brief description would be \\"the story of Billy Beane\\" and his tenure as GM of the Oakland A's. <br />That's selling it short. By a mile.  <br /> <br />This book is educational, informative and inspiring. It is a book that makes you look at baseball with new eyes. It takes you, briefly but lucidly, into the world of the draft, high school sports, minor leagues, retired players, coaches at all levels, computers, the language of statistics...and above all, the inside world of major league baseball. But this time, from a point of view...from a manner of thinking...you have never considerd. <br /> <br />For some strange reason, it now makes me look at my world of medicine in new ways. <br /> <br />Here's the thing: it's more important to not make an out, than it is to get a hit. <br />It took a few minutes for that to really sink in, but that subtle shift in perspective makes an enormous amount of difference. It really does. <br /> <br />Lewis, through the tale of Billy Beane, makes this idea crystalline in clarity with statistics and theory, but not robbing the story of any of its' humanity. <br /> <br />Beane was a high school phenom; Lewis does some of his best work describing what it must be like to be one. He doesn't make it in the bigs, but through some pretty radical decision-making, ends up the GM of the A's. <br /> <br />You will follow a few players from their drafting to singular moments in their careers, and you will cheer. Out loud. <br />I did. <br />I read this entire book on a flight from Detroit to L.A., and many of my fellow passengers thought me daft. A loon. Here's this guy, in his window seat, woo-hooing while reading a hardcover book. Laughing out loud. Saying \\"Yesss!\\" like some bad Marv Albert impersonator. <br /> <br />Scott Hatteberg will stick with me for the rest of my life. I feellike I know the guy. I wanna have him over for dinner. As I do Billy Beane, and Mr. Lewis as well. <br /> <br />There are over a half dozen other people who spring to life, due to some terrific writing, but if you've read this far, I want you to discover them on your own. <br /> <br />How many times in your life will you read a book that changes fundamentally the way you look at something? Something that you have thought pretty much the same about since childhood. <br /> <br />Since Little League and watching my beloved Dodgers back in the 70's, stealing second was \\"good\\", a sacrifice bunt was \\"going by the book\\"...there are whole tenets of baseball wisdom that are challenged here, but challenged for the love of the game, not the contrary.  <br /> <br />His quote from Bill James (a person I now feel I must seek out and buy all his books...) about errors being a statistic of \\"opinion\\" made total sense to me; I almost felt like an idiot that I never thought that way about it myself. <br /> <br />If you love baseball, if you only like baseball, if you like a great story well told, your next purchase NEEDS to be this book. I guarantee...guarantee, mind you...that you will not be disappointed.
B00097A5I6|4.0|This album many not blow you away on the first listen, but it could easily grow on you! It's definitely better than Heathen Chemistry, and may be the band's best album since Morning Glory! It sounds slightly different from any other Oasis albums, but it's still something that Oasis fans should appreciate. If you hate Oasis, then you won't like this album, but if you're an Oasis fan, then I definitely recommend this album for you!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Just viewed on NBC. It was Magnificent. There were many of their famous songs, and the 2001 \\"Hole in the World\\" brought me to tears.
B000929AJQ|4.0|I just bought this CD, after a couple of listens I can say that this CD is just as good as The Fragile. To me, the best track on the CD is the first one. This CD is not as sinister as Trent Reznor's earlier stuff, its more rock-oriented and less electronic than Pretty Hate Machine or Downward Spiral but I give With Teeth an A+ for creative its lyrics and imaginative musical themes. People who like Nine Inch Nails will like this CD.
0441012906|4.0|I grabbed \\"Century Rain\\" with no expectations at all. I got it as a christmas present, and had never read any of the author's work before. I was positively surprised, most of all because the book is such an unusual, creative combination of many familiar things.    There's your regular space opera with a long-gone godlike alien race, alienesque superhumans, Earth devastated due to mankinds' mistakes, spaceships and space battles and all-powerful nanotechnology. Then there's a detective story set in Paris in the 50's, which also picks up a romantic twist as it goes on and gets mixed with the space-opera side, and in between there's a whiff of Stargate - yet it still manages to feel like hard scifi instead of light science-fantasy.    Also, it's one of the shortest 500-page scifi novels I've ever read. Once I got started, I could hardly put it down. What keeps me from calling it a really great book is the fact that I didn't really emotionally connect with any of the characters. The main characters weren't all that deep, and some of the minor ones felt like missed opportunities, interesting persons who should've got more attention. And the end was a bit of an anticlimax after all the amazingly, extremely tough situations before it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Okay, folks. There's a lot of hysteria over this album, as can be seen in  <br />the reviews. Let me start off by saying that my time of music fanaticism was back in the day of the Clash-- the amazing first album, and London Calling. Absolute classics. But, when an album like American Idiot hits the scene, I feel like I have to open my big yap and say something. <br /> <br />Green Day has been around for quite awhile, eh? I have to confess, I don't own a copy of \\"Dookie\\". Amazing, huh? Fact is, I never was much of a fan-- until now. I remember the controversy over Billie Joe's imitated British accent, and reaching the conclusion that if loads of White American singers over many decades have tried desperately to sound Black, then why can't some kid from Cali try to sound Brit?  <br /> <br />So, now we come to American Idiot. I'm not going to be a wuss and say that the title track isn't so good. The title track kicks ass. The last time I was this blown away by a single was \\"Bulls On Parade\\" by Rage Against the Machine (a band that never gets mentioned any more, because they were too contravercial--that was '96).  <br /> <br />From here, it gets even better. \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" is an incredible single. Overplayed, well, maybe, but it deserved to cross over many lines. And \\"Holiday\\"--- even better! The best single of 2005, hands down. Read the lyrics-- every high school and college student would be privileged to read these words, just as I felt blessed to embrace lyrics by Dylan, Lennon, and Strummer. <br /> <br />I have to say, I feel kind of bad for all the people who dis' Green Day for this masterpiece. Quite frankly, you really have to be an American Idiot to not appreciate what they've done here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
1881273156|5.0|I read this book at the suggestion of my counselor.  I can't wait to thank her.  It has really helped me to discover where I contributed to my marriage falling apart.  It was an easy read, but the content just made so much sense right away.  I also got the journal and find that also thought provoking and easy to use.  I feel there is plenty of space so I can continue to add on to each comment.  It is helping me greatly to heal my feelings around divorcing the love of my life.  I'm also hopeful it will help us reconcile and hopefully even re-marry one day and correct a huge mistake that we made.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|More offensive and satirical humor from Trey Parker and Matt Stone, hilarious. If you were offended, well you had it coming.
B00097A5I6|5.0|Ok, I'm constantly reminded by people all around me at my office that Oasis use to be ok but they suck these days.  I of course disagree with this on many levels.  One thing I really like about this album is it feels (at least to me) very different from past albums.  In fact the first time I listened to the album I almost wrote it off.  Upon a second round and watching the DVD included on the DualDisc version I realized this was their intention.  It's also cool to me pretty much everyone contributed to this album in the form of song writing, etc.  Any way, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about but for some reason this album has moved me to come out to Amazon and post my thoughts which I don't believe I've ever done before.   <br /> <br />Just buy this one and I think you'll be very happy with the results.

B0007MVXQG|3.0|This was my first Judas Priest album and I was curious to see what all of the hype is about. After listening to \\"Judas Rising,\\" I could almost feel the rebelliousness that gave Priest such popularity from some and such hatred from others. Rob Halford is amazing on this track as are their two guitarists (I was surprised that Judas Priest's drummer included blast beats in their songs). I wish the liner notes  had included which one of them did the solo(s) in each of the songs; the first solo in \\"Judas\\" is ok, but the second one is fantastic and really fast at the end. The lyrics aren't really about anything, but go great with the music. Sadly, the rest of the album does not live up to the leadoff track. \\"Hellrider\\" is pretty good and \\"Loch Ness\\" has excellent instrumentation; it's a shame that the lyrics suck. Halford sort of quiets down after \\"Judas,\\" but he has his moments. The guitar duo of Glen Tipton and K.K. Downing is the best part of the album; they are probably the most underrated guitar team in mainstream metal (except by Priest fans, who think they are gods). The DVD on the other side is interesting, but with playing surfaces on both sides of the disc, neither the DVD nor the CD plays perfectly because both have scratches on them already. Overall, I guess hardcore fans might enjoy this, but fans looking into Priest for the first time should look elsewhere.
B0002858YS|5.0|I picked this Cd up yesterday, noting the two songs it contained being Mr. Brightside and Somebody told me. But after listening to it there is more gems in this cd than one could expect.<br /><br />Andy Your a Star is one of those, followed closely by Jenny was a friend of mine. All are sung wonderfully by Brendan Flowers who's voice is such a pleasure to listen too.<br /><br />There is also the use of a gospel choir, for example they used it for Andy You're a star, which I think added depth to the chorus by giving it undertones to compliment Brendan's own.<br /><br />If you like the killers, try looking up Duran Duran or coldplay. They should give you a pretty good idea what the Killers are trying to come off from
B00009W0U4|5.0|I just want to say that I love Monica Belluci, and to see her brutalized like that made me feel helpless and angry. I knew that this was a piece of fiction, but nonetheless I still breathed a sigh of relief when I saw the extras featuring the FX director. From the emotions spawned by watching this film I came to realize that a good film doesn't have to be something that makes you FEEL good. A good film should make us realize something about ourselves. And I tell you that I never want to feel the way I felt after watching that rape scene! Because I did get a taste of the type of REGRET and rage that the significant other of a rape victim might feel, I will take precautions to ensure nothing like that happens to my baby. The fact that the rape scene took about 10 minutes is supposed to illustrate just how quickly a person's life can be turned upside down. That was a long ten minutes to the viewer(and the victim), but what is ten minutes to anyone not involved? I hope this film is perceived by others the same way and not just as some cheap thrill.
0670033375|5.0|The human capacity to live our lives without noticing the most significant forces impacting our lives is immense. Maybe that is just our evolutionary advantage and nothing to complain about. It takes however a bright and observant mind like Mr. Diamond's to notice, understand and classify these forces. And then to write that experience down in a way that transcends the time and distance to these mainly forgotten civilizations. Armed with this knowledge we can draw our own conclusions regarding the future of human kind. This is the third book from the same author that had made a major impact on my view of the world and societies in which I live. For that I am very thankful.
B00097A5I6|4.0|Noel Gallagher likes to refer to his band as a \\"60's retro act\\".  I wasn't quite sure what he meant until I heard \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\".  Part Beatles, part Kinks, part Velvet Underground, part Who, Oasis has always worn their influences on their proverbial sleeve. On DBTT they step back in time and deliver a terrific album weaving a raw 60's sounding production with a great batch of songs.  While lacking the straight ahead anthemic rockers (with the exception of the single \\"Lyla\\") that have built them a world wide legion of fans, this album goes start to finish without one clunker.  Liam's \\"Guess God thinks I'm Abel\\" is a revelation and one of the best tracks.  Andy Bell's two tunes, the opener \\"Turn Up the Sun\\" and \\"Keep the Dream Alive\\", are class.  Gem's \\"A Bell will Ring\\" has a great riff and is the best rocker on the record (so was \\"Hung in a Bad Place\\" from the last album).  Noel's songs vary from the pop-ish \\"Lyla\\", to the snappy \\"Part of the Que\\", to the stunning closer \\"Let there be Love\\", which was resurrected from the \\"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants\\" demos.  He wisely lets Liam sing the verses and he adds an absolutely surreal vocal part that makes this maybe the best song they have ever recorded.   This album, while not perfect, is a clear indication that Oasis has something to say again. I only hope that next time they find their amplifiers.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|From start to finish, this DVD is absolutely incredible. Not only is it an amalgamation of most of their best work, but their talent and showmanship can only be truly appreciated when watched. Even with repeated viewings, the sense of awe at the incredible skill of these men is unlikely to leave you. The instrumental sections(in true DT fashion) are exceptional, specifically on Beyond this Life and Instrumedley, and the bonus material is also great. Overall, Live at Budokan is probably the best DVD investment I have ever made, and makes the wait for their next material all the more unbearable.
B00000J7S8|4.0|So she sounds monotonous and ignorant? Maybe. Maybe she just has to articulate the words so coldly and clearly. But I don't think it detracts anything at all from the artistic value of this album. <br /> <br />At points, I would have to admit that her singing is emotionally detached. This is but an element of style, however, as I still find this album very enjoyable.  <br /> <br />NB - Interestingly, I find that each of her subsequent releases seems to overtake the previous in terms of emotional detachment. If you're trying to deciding which of her albums to buy, I would recommend this album instead of the newer ones.
B00097A5I6|4.0|I was actually pleasently surprised with this effort. Its no \\"What's The Story (Morning Glory)\\", but in fairness, that's never going to happen. There's no single that jumps out at you, but the album as a whole is a very good listen. The only problem I have with \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" is that it sounds like one long song. Its a pretty good song though.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I was delighted with Farewell 1 Tour last night that I have pre-ordered the DVD and cannot wait for it to arrive. Even though I did not necessarily grow up listening to The Eagles (born in the early 70's), they have become one of my favorite 70's bands. After the performance was over I had goose-bumps and my eyes were watering from the phenominal feeling I got.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|...don't fix it.  I am that rare Beatles fan who considers the original LET IT BE to be their favorite effort by the Fab Four.  The charm of that album is the relaxed, tossed-off vibe you get by listening to John Lennon making wise-acre remarks after songs and ditties like Maggie Mae and Dig It.  With this album, the Beatles dropped their pretensions, let their guard down and wrote some charming and moving songs.  I would say their most moving songs.  Oddly enough, a lot of the tracks on the original LET IT BE sound more raw and \\"naked\\" than those on this new retread.  I find that rawness to be a nice counterbalance to Spector's elaborate string arrangements.  Anyone expecting LET IT BE...NAKED to sound dramatically different from the original should be forewarned: you're better off with what's been around for thirty five years.
0671015206|5.0|The negative reviews tend to discuss how everything presented in this book is common sense.  However, our society tends to act in exactly the opposite way.  National savings are low, while consumer debt is high.  The ideas may be simple, and may appear to be common sense, but the data indicates that people do not necessarily *USE* common sense when making financial decisions. <br /> <br />The authors present the ideas (yes, they are simple) and show through case studies how these ideas make a difference.  Many of the case studies are similar, but each serves to solidify the overall message of the book.  The purpose of the book is not necessarily to introduce groundbreaking ideas in personal finance, but to convince you to start using the common sense that we've all heard before.  Save more, spend less.  Fewer financial concerns will bring more time to enjoy life.
B00000JNO1|4.0|This may not be the best Skynyrd album, but the songs never get boring, it's almost a side of the band you dont really see. The band took a bold stand against handguns in \\"Saturday Night Special\\", something that is definatley respectable considering the conservative position of most southernors on fire arms. Great albums go ahead, buy it or you'll be missing out.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I too just saw the concert on TV and it is the best they have ever sounded.  The fact that they reunited after the \\"discord\\" years ago makes them even better.  The quality of their voices, the time spent to make each song perfect, shows in their performance.  I can not wait until June 14 to add this to my collection!  Each  <br />classic tune seems like it is brand new and I am still amazed that I know every word to every song.  I love the Eagles! <br />
B00000JNO2|4.0|This clearly is'nt one of Skynyrd's best, and it's kinda one of thier first country sounding efforts. But still I dont see why people dont like it so much, it sounds fine to me
B000002UAU|5.0|This 1967 release is a monumental rock album. Prior to this release rock was considered low brow and not an art form.  However all this changed when The Beatles released this amazing album. With songs like a day in the life, lucy in the sky with diamonds, and I could basically count numerous more. The cover art is a modern day classic and many copied it for several reasons, i.e., the simspons and it is one of the best covers ever created. The beatles also have an awesome collection of muisicians and vocalists. It is not all about Lenon and McCartney.
B00006JDU9|5.0|Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace is how the Star Wars saga began. The way this movie connects to the others is amazing. We see the young Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn. We see the Sith, Darth Sidious and Darth Maul, who revelaed themselve to the Jedi for the first time in a millenia here. We see Palpatine living a double life as the good-hearted Senator from Naboo and as Darth Sidious. We see him manipulate the Senate in order to set his massive plan to take over the Republic into motion. We see the young Anakin Skywalker, who's fate is the evil Darth Vader, but who will eventually bring balance to the Force. <br /> <br />Surely these things are enough to win over the Jar Jar haters. The good things in this movie greatly outweigh the bad. The lightsaber duel is suspensful, the space battle is exciting, the Gungan/Droid battle is amazing, the pod race is suspenseful, the special effects are dazzling, the music is moving and the story is intriguing. <br /> <br />To know the true story of the Star Wars saga as a whole is to accept the Phantom Menace for what the great movie it is.
B000000W5N|5.0|Without a doubt the best Stones album ever. The \\"Out Of Our Heads\\" album is tied for best, but Sticky wins by a nose. This album showed the group's ability to focus on doing fabulous music while the world around them is going askew. Over a year and a half the group recorded this album in 4 places: London, New York, Chicago, and Alabama. They lost Brian Jones to an unsolved murder, Mick got married, and starred in 2 movies, and the dreaded Altamont Speedway concert. This is thier best material starting everything off with the #1 \\"Brown Sugar\\", then it shows an underrated piece of guitar rock with \\"Sway\\", afterwards the other hit \\"Wild Horses\\", the essence of the group \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking?\\" has everything going for it guitars, angry lyrics, and a fabulous 5 minute instrumental piece, \\"You Gotta Move\\" is a rather weak blues number, and so was \\"I Got The Blues\\", but it makes up for it royally with \\"Bitch\\", the ever haunting \\"Sister Morphene\\", \\"Dead Flowers\\" sounds like something you could hear on \\"Hee Haw\\", and a underrated ballad which has new meaning for me these days \\"Moonlight Mile\\". I actually saw the movie \\"Moonlight Mile\\" two months after my wife passed away, and one of these days I'll write a review for it as the movie really got to me, and so did this song. There would never be a true Stones album like this ever again. It didn't, and doesn't get any better than this.
B0008ISM40|5.0|I have been a fan since Pretty Hate Machine and Trent Reznors' progression through time is amazing. His music is well written, catchy and pure. This CD comes at a great time. The rock and pop world are so dull and boring, this CD brings music back to life. I would recommend this CD if you want a kick of hard rock/industrial <br />madness in your butt. NIN puts on a great show as well. Keep em coming Trent, the music world needs you.
B000002H97|3.0|First off, hiring Bob Rock was a huge mistake. that and the fact that the reason Justice was so good was because it was fueled by the anger over Cliff's death. And what made the first three albums so amazing and legendary was a lot due to Cliff Burton. Don't get me wrong, James, Kirk, and Lars all contributed, but Cliff's absence can be felt in this-his influence in their old sound is undeniable. This album has pretty much the same heaviness as Justice but, except for one song, nothing close to the speed and thrash, which is what kind of band Metallica started out as. And I consider And Justice for All to be the third best album by any band after Master of Puppets and Vulgar display of Power, with One  being the best Metallica song after mop. But back to their \\"self-titled\\" album, which I never thought sounded like vintage 'Tallica. Start with the most overrated Metallica song, Enter Sandman. Come on, after the brilliant lyrics of Dyer's Eve and Fade to Black we get \\"dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragon's fire, and of things that will bite\\"? and \\"heavy thoughts tonight and they aren't of snow white.\\" The only songs I listen to are Hollier than thou, Don't Tread on me, Nothing Else Matters, and a few others on the second half. I can't even listen to anything past this album. If you want to see Metallica in their prime being true Metallica, not wearing '50's style shirts and haircuts, sueing their fans for not paying to listen to their new crap, and acting like selfish, stuborn kids on documentary movies, watch Cliff 'em All and head bang.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke is an amazing movie. I've had a love hate relationship with anime over the years. At times I've seen some great ones, like Sprited Away, and then gone out looking for more and been disappointed with a lot of silliness. This film, though, is another great version of Japanese anime for an adultish audience. This is not for small kids. It's complex, at times gruesome, and much of the imagery and lore will be very unfamiliar to Western audiences. But that's what's so wonderful about it for the right audience. It's fantasy from an entirely different perspective, with spirits and talking animals and demons. There's also quite an anti-industrialization and pro-environmentalist message to this. Maybe none of the ingredients by themselves explain why this is so different and unusual. I think, really, it's that in the Western World so much of our reference points for fantasy come from Tolkein, CS Lewis, etc - writers who wrote inspired by an Anglo tradition. So we're use to certain types of wizards, obvious good and bad guys, heroic behaviour of a certain type. But with Japanese anime all bets are off. The reference points are entirely different, based in a different mythology. Viewers need to open their minds and just enjoy the wonder of a different worldview on fantasy. It won't be for everyone, but if this sounds at all interesting to you please check this out.
0375713751|1.0|As a working mother, I find this book terribly offensive.  It is NOT a light-hearted tale of the trials and tribulations we all face, but a devious, insulting insinuation that it is, in fact, impossible to be both a good mother and a successful career woman.   <br /> <br />Don't waste your time.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This movie is a waste of energy on your DVD player. This movie is not funny, I HATED IT! People told me this may be the greatest comedy ever, they LIED! This movie has no real plot, and is extremely unoriginal. Making fun of mexicans named Pedro is not comedy to me. If you want real comedy get \\"Freddy Got FIngered\\" staring Tom Green and Rip Torn. Now thats a movie that will keep you laughing.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|Forget Desperate Housewives or Lost. You are missing some of the best acting in television if you are not watching Veronica Mars. Absolutely the best not watched show around.  I was totally hooked from the first episode.  Kristen Bell should be in line for an emmy.  TV needs more characters like hers and the other well developed characters from Veronica Mars.  Rarely do characters have as much depth as the ones on this show.  Comparing this to Buffy the Vampire Slayer doesn't do this show justice.  The high school setting of Neptune High is authentic and credible.  The ongoing whodunit plot drives you to watch every week while a \\"mystery\\" gets solved every week giving you satisfaction.  And unlike other shows, (i.e., Lost) the finale was extremely satisfying wrapping up the suspense.  This is a sign of great writing that demonstrates a confidence in its characters to carry through to a second season.  Absolutely a must see.  If you're not watching, you're missing the best show on tv.  Next year, it will air opposite of Lost on Wednesdays at 9:00 on UPN.  Take it from me, this is guaranteed to more interesting than Lost, which seems to be taking a turn to the bizarre.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|I have never seen the movie, but I still enjoyed the strange music and musical choices that permeate this cd.  Somehow it sounds disjointed, but it works all the same.  I think it is put together better than the first soundtrack was, it seems more consistently good at least.  I highly enjoyed this strange but delightful soundtrack; it has become a favorite.  Even the dialogue was pretty cool, mainly because it gives me a little hint of what the actual movie is like.  I just wish it had more material...oh well.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Out of Exile <br />        As the final song in Out of Exile marches its way through the speakers, you receive a strong sense of dj vu, almost as though it was the ending song played as the credits of a movie roll across the screen.  It was a movie you have experinced many mixed emotions with, but in the end it was incredibly satisfying. <br /> <br /> Thus is the story so far with Audioslave, the Soundgarden + Rage Against the Machine incarnation, and the trend continues with their sophmore effort, Out of Exile.  After a steller first effort, which has been overly and unfairly critisized, I came into Out of Exile with expectations sky high.  Unlike many fans, I was not around in the hey-day of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine and have since been turned on to their music through Audioslave, and not the reverse.  Therefore, I have the intriuging ability to examin Audioslave based not on what they have done in their segragated pasts, but only against their potiential in the future.   <br /> <br /> With that being said, Out of Exile is good album, no, a great album.  At first I was a little disapointed.  I had dove headlong into their self-titled debut without a single seed of anticipation and loved every minute of it.  This album, however, I had been anticipating for months and was expecting, and demanding, an instant classic.  What I found, at least a first listen, was an unoriginal, strictly formualic, and somewhat disapointing sequal to what was a fantastic first effort.  The songs all seemed to be lacking that certain freshness that the first had so eagerly accepted.  The first single, \\"Be Yourself,\\" was generic, formualic, and about as predictable as any other radio friendly song that dominates the rock charts nowadays.  Many of the songs were also disapointingly simple, a surprising move by Chris Cornell, who has been known for his deep, if inaccessable lyrics.  \\"Doesn't Remind Me,\\" is in a fact nothing more than a list of things Cornell likes because,they don't remind him of anything.  And, at first listen, nearly all the more Rage-esq rockers such as \\"Drown Me Slowly,\\" and \\"Man or Animal,\\" sounded terribly mechanical.  But after being able to listen through the album muliple times, I can safely say that this an exceptional 50 minutes of music. <br /> <br /> Like all good rock and roll, this album requires time to set in.  As the initial disapointment faded to tolerance and then to acceptance, I came to realize just how strong of a set this is.  The most noticable difference from the first was just in it's overaul feel.  Out of Exile has a much tighter structure to it, making for a smooth and beautiful flow.  The band still follows the strict Verse-Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Solo-Conclusion formula, but every song is worked to perfection.  The voice of Chris Cornell is matched only by the outrageous guitar playing of Tom Morrello and there are times when it almost seems as if the two are trying to out-do each other.  It is, however, on the occasions when they truly merge together, that a glimpse of the future is seem, and it is a bright future indeed.  When the complete marriage of Cornell and Morello, Voice and Instrument, is attained the result is an absolutely stunning display of what music should sound like. <br /> <br /> The band's amplified unity and confidence in each other is also readily apparent throughout the album, and every one of the twelve songs could be a new single.  Out of Exile has managed to expose the softer and even blissful nature of the band that was only touched on in their debut.  Songs such as Dandelion, an obvious and inspirational ode to Cornell's newly born daughter convey this newfound sense of peace and optimism.  Not to disapoint fans of their more Rage-esq tunes, this album rocks just as hard as the first.  Highlighted by such headbangers as \\"Your Time has Come,\\" \\"The Worm,\\" and the title track, \\"Out of Exile,\\" Audioslave has still managed to channel their rage, despite its everloosening hold on them.  Cornell's continued dabblings in blues are present as well in the mournful melodies \\"Heavens Dead,\\" and \\"#1 Zero.\\"  The true strengh of the album, however, lies in its almost 80s like power ballads, which are reminisent of the great bands of the past.  Its difficult to put into words the magnificence and power of the tracks \\"Yesterday to Tommorrow,\\" and \\"The Curse,\\" their cool beauty is just something that you'll have to hear for yourself. <br /> <br /> Yet dispite the overall maturity of the band and the undeniable greatness of this album, I still feel like there is so much more to come from Audioslave.  Chris Cornell has been quoted to say that he wants to turn out albums on a rapid yearly basis, like the some of the great bands of old.  But to reach the upper echelon of the immortal bands of the past, Audioslave needs to take that step into the unknown.  The need to break the formula - tried and true though it is - has never been more dire, and to have already been so great, Audioslave has barely begun to tap into their vast potential. <br /> <br /> People complain that Audioslave lacks a certain unplacable something, that they are nothing more than a wild experiment in the soundscape of rock.  The truth is there are times when they sound like Soundgarden, times when they sound like Rage, and even times when they sound like U2 or Zeppelin, but in the their second effort, Audioslave finally just sounds like Audioslave.  Chris Cornell has cemented his status as one rock and roll's great vocalists, and Tom Morello's guitar playing will take you out of this world.  And even if they never break the mold, even if they continue to put out albums like Out of Exile that only touch on greatness, I will thrilled.  For Audioslave has arrived and is hear to stay, this may not be Soundgarden, and this may not be Rage, but this is damn good rock and roll from four of the best in the business. <br />
B0000C9V3T|4.0|I have not seen the movies yet, but I have listened to both soundtracks.  overall, I think the vol 2 soundtrack is better and more consistently good than this one, but this vol 1 soundtrack has several really good songs that are better than anything on vol 2.  For example, both of the songs \\"battle without honor or humanity\\" and \\"don't let me be misunderstood\\" are completely awesome, groovy, and cool songs that I listened to again and again.  Some of the other stuff on  here is pretty good, but inconsistent.  I would think that it would only make sense if you have seen the movie, however.  I recommend you check this out if you liked the movie, or even if you haven't seen it (like me).  There's bound to be at least several songs on here that you will like, even if the others seem a little odd and out of place (such as the rap song).  As I understand it, there is a lot missing.  I wish they didn't put in the random noises at the end, it bugs me a lot.  They could have used that space and more to put in more awesome songs!
B00001R3GF|5.0|Many say that Some Girls was the last great Stones album and the best Stones album of the 70's.  I agree with the latter but not with the former statement.  Some Girls was considered somewhat of a comeback following some \\"disappointing\\" albums.  But with former-Faces guitarist Ron Wood, who had joined them from the previous Black and Blue, the Stones were set, and in response to the changing music scene, i.e. disco and punk, the Stones proved they were still relevant. With its reference to booze and pills, the life on the bars and clubs circuit of \\"Before They Make Me Run\\" eerily reflects the drug problems Keith Richards was having at the time.<br /><br />They still show they have teeth in the rocker \\"When The Whip Comes Down\\" and the angry nastiness \\"Lies\\" is the closest to punk that the Stones ever got, as it's directed to some \\"dirty Jezebel\\" whom he tells to go to, you know where, because \\"lies lies lies lies, that's your rules.\\"  However, the former's take on gay life in the cities isn't exactly flattering.<br /><br />With its insistent funky rock rhythm, \\"Shattered\\" is one of my favourites on this album, and it irks me that it only peaked at #31 on the Hot 100 charts.  The Stones' take on the state of the big city, with its decadent fashions, rising crime rate, and materialism, is a snapshot of the era.<br /><br />For something mid-paced but with more than a hint of their newfound energy, their cover of \\"Just My Imagination,\\" which was a #1 hit for the Temptations in 1971, is just the ticket.  And \\"Beast of Burden,\\" which made it to #8 on the pop charts, is one of the Stones' better ballads.<br /><br />In 1978, the disco craze was in full swing and the Stones caught onto it.  In fact \\"Miss You\\" became their eighth and final #1 hit, combining blues with disco, with a steady paced rhythm not unlike what Heart would do with \\"Straight On.\\"<br /><br />The title track isn't exactly complimentary to women, as Jagger rattles off what some girls do or give:  \\"...give me children that I never ask them for\\", or rather what he uses them for, and then, compares notes on women of different skin colours and nationalities.  English girls he denounces as too prissy,  American girls as being too materialistic, and as for black girls...  But he's most generous on Chinese girls.  In other words, a rock star's view on groupie women and those who have gone beyond.<br /><br />The Stones send up country with some full blown steel guitar and fiddle in a tale about a girl with \\"Faraway Eyes\\" with Mick's tongue-in-cheek monologue  including being so honoured on hearing about \\"the lord being on your side\\" that \\"I ran twenty red lights in his honour.\\"  This is probably the funniest song the Stones ever done, and I get a laugh out of it whenever I hear it.  That being the case, I can't help noticing this parallel, that Rod Stewart also did a disco and country song, \\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy\\" and \\"You're In My Heart\\" respectively.<br /><br />A classic Stones album, not the last great one due to the fact that 1986's Dirty Work introduced me to them and got the ball rolling.  And of course, let's not forget Tattoo You.\\"...give me children that I never ask them for\\", or rather what he uses them for, and then, compares notes on women of different skin colours and nationalities.

B000002BYA|5.0|If you are reading these reviews then you are probably already an SRV fan and if you are an SRV fan than you certainly know what excellence is. For me, the original trio of Shannon, Leighton and SRV is simply and purely the best.  This live version of \\"Cold Shot\\" is fantastic and \\"Testify\\" never fails to deliver. Personally I find the horns add a full, swing-like quality that I dislike, so I skip to the end to catch \\"Rude Mood\\".
B000002INR|4.0|In a magazine interview, when asked about the newer metal groups emerging during the late 80's, Gene Simmons said he liked Skid Row because of their \\"hunger.\\"  Compared to hard metal groups like Warrant, Poison, Europe, and Winger, Skid Row had that certain edge that in terms of hard-driving energy, outdid their aforementioned peers.  Led by Sebastian Bach, Skid Row's career and debut album was also no doubt helped out when they opened for Bon Jovi during their 1989 US stadium tour.<br /><br />Their first three singles hit the Hot 100, although the heaviest of the three, the rebellious and anthemic \\"Youth Gone Wild,\\" insultingly spent only two weeks on the charts, peaking at #99.  Definitely should've been a Top 5 or at least Top 20, for sure.  At an early age or whatever one's age, why sell out with a \\"3 piece Wall Street Smile,\\" to which Bach shoots back with . \\"Hey man, there's something you should know.  Park Avenue leads to Skid Row.<br /><br />The other two, rock ballads, made it to the Top Ten.  The #4 hit, the sobering and wrenching \\"18 And Life\\" tells the story of a mean-spirited loner, a bit of a sociopathic boy who \\"married trouble and had a courtship with a gun.\\"  After shooting a kid with a gun, he got the above prison sentence.  \\"I Remember You\\" made it to #6 and is more a tender power ballad that makes a good companion on the radio with Damn Yankees' \\"High Enough.\\"<br /><br />That hunger, demonstrated by Bach's powerful and rough vocals, is evident in the strong opening track, \\"Big Guns\\" which like some of the songs here, feature women either predatory or who are hot but probably moral garbage, such as \\"Sweet Little Sister.\\"  The tough machismo-on-a-wild-Saturday night \\"Piece Of Me\\" is another fine example of hard-driving rock and some whisky-rough Bach vocals.<br /><br />\\"Here I Am\\" has the energy and rhythm worthy of Motley Crue's \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" while the energy doesn't let up on \\"Makin' A Mess,\\" which is like metalized 50's rock, think Van Halen's \\"Top Jimmy,\\" but with more attitude.  While all members contributed to the songwriting, the majority of the songs were written by guitarist Dave Sabo and bassist Rachel Bolan.

078681859X|5.0|My favorite book is The Aumulet of Samarkand. I like it because its like Harry Potter, They use a lot of magic, But it doesn't get boring or unrealistic. It's about a boy named Nathanial who is trying to get revenge on somone by stealing the aumulet from him. He studies hard and learns the spell he can use to summon a Jeanie called Bartimaes. This is the best book of all time. It wont disipoint you like Harry Potter.   <br />
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I saw the concert on NBC last night and was totally wowed.  I have always enjoyed the Eagles, but this particular performance was incredible!  California, Nevada, and Arizona have a treat in store when the Eagles perform there.  I wish I could manage to go, but I will just have to wait for the DVD to be shipped.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I am a huge fan of Sarah McLachlan and was so excited to get another album of hers. The reason I didn't give it five stars was because I feel like it still can not compare to her old albums with classics such as Sweet Surrender, Building a Mystery, I Will Remember You, etc. However, it is still a very solid album with beautiful songs (my favourites being Fallen, Stupid and Train Wreck). I think at first you feel a little disappointed but as you listen more and more to the album it really grows on you. Afterglow is also one of those albums where you can continue to listen to for a long time without getting bored of it. Fans of McLachlan will not be disappointed and it's clear that she will continue to attract fans both old and new.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie succeeds on all levels (as pointed out in most of the other reviews here).  The only nit to pick is the lack of a commentary track on the dvd.  Wouldn't it be great to have the Coen's thoughts preserved for posterity!  Just the same, this is definitely a movie to own; I watched it twice in as many days and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, and I'll do it again as soon as time allows.

B00097A5I6|4.0|Don't Believe the Truth is a very good album from start to finish.  I have always reserved 5 stars out of 5 for Oasis' first two albums, so I would give Don't Believe the Truth 4 out of 5.  Whereas on the last two CDs (Standing on the Shoulder of Giants & Heathen Chemistry) Oasis didn't really deviate from their typical sounds, this new CD offers some tracks that go against previous offerings from the band.  \\"The Importance of Being Idle,\\" \\"Mucky Fingers,\\" and \\"Part of the Queue\\" can be identified as great non-sounding Oasis tunes.  Is it coincidence maybe that those three were written and sung by Noel Gallagher, who's attempting to broaden his own musical repertoire?  These three tracks contain better lyrics by Noel than some of those since 1997.  Brother Liam however, sticks to what made Oasis great in the 1990's with very good tunes like \\"Love Like A Bomb\\" and \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel.\\"  \\"The Meaning of Soul\\" is an okay song, but I typically have been skipping it, the only one on the CD for that matter.  \\"Love Like a Bomb\\" and guitarist Gem's \\"A Bell Will Ring\\" have a definite mid-60's Beatles feel to them, which is totally fine by me.  Bassist Andy Bell offers the opener \\"Turn up the Sun\\" and \\"Keep the Dream Alive,\\" which are both excellent tracks which should be even better live and in person.  The first single \\"Lyla,\\" is also worth mentioning as a good listen, but definitely not the best on the LP.  I would have to say that my favorite tracks on Don't Believe the Truth are \\"The Importance of Being Idle,\\" \\"Mucky Fingers,\\" \\"Part of the Queue,\\" \\"Love Like a Bomb\\" and \\"Keep the Dream Alive.\\"  Diehard Oasis fans will ultimately love this album, while the average fan will find some attractive tunes on this disc if they take the time to listen.  I for one like the direction that Oasis is going, and I'm already imagining what the next LP will sound like.  All in all, Don't Believe the Truth is a must for your music collection.

Just putting it short, there is no flaw with this cd, it's Metallica in their prime. Master of Puppets (song)is my favorite Metallica song and best on the cd. Lots of awesome solos, really heavy and lots of madness. One of the best cds I've ever bought, definitely best Metallica cd. METALLICA RULES THE WORLD!!!!!!! BUY IT!!!!!!!

Every song is beautiful and I never tire of listening to his sexy voice.  If I had to pick a couple of favorites, they would be \\"So Long, Marianne\\" and \\"One of Us Cannot Be Wrong.\\"  I've outgrown most of the music from those days, but \\"The Songs of Leonard Cohen\\" will be with me always.
0783232039|4.0|I agree saying this is a comedy but it also falls into the horror section with the gore.<br /><br />It stars once again, Chucky, the smart mouthed doll returning to life by his old girlfriend raising him up from the dead once again. Jealous of her attitude toward him, Chucky kills her and trasfers her soul into another doll. Thus begins Chucky and his bride, Tiff's killing rampage. They are trying to get back to Chucky's corpse to collect the amulet that will turn them back into humans.<br /><br />But don't be fooled - as usual they have a half naked chick running around, actually a few of them and doll sex, as well as the disturbing fact that Tiff gives birth to another doll.<br /><br />The great thing is there is a Gay boy in the movie which gives the movie a good sense of reality - that there are Gay Men out there in life. He's cute. But don't get attached - he is killed.<br /><br />I do suggest watching this movie if you enjoyed the others - Chucky is humerous in his smart-mouthed ways. It was alot better then Child's Play.
B00042YC7Q|5.0|You won't be disappointed with this cd.  I've described it as Laura Pausini with an attitude.  The songs (all in Spanish) are excellently crafted, the lyrics are powerful and full of social issues, and Bebe exudes a sensuality that rises above all stereotypes of \\"feminine sexuality\\" that so dominate most US music today. The music is very interesting, with complex rhythms and instruments woven into very groovy tunes. Don't let the CD's \\"faux-Duran Duran\\" cover scare you off...Bebe is definitely an artist of the 21st century, uniquely Spanish, and fun.
B00005JNEW|3.0|\\"Friday Night Lights\\" is a great movie. Not in terms of what happens, or how it happens, but in terms of acting and story line. The movie starts off promisingly enough, and it starts to live up to expectations. Not soon after that, though, the movie starts to drag in parts. Normally this is not problem. All movies do this. From great movies like \\"Garden State\\" (in the scene where they bury the hamster) and terrible movies like \\"I, Robot\\" (the entire first half). But with this movie it doesn't just drag for a minute or two. It drags...and drags...and drags for about ten minutes. There are aspects of the movie that are left unexplained, like that one kid's mother. All throughout the movie, people keep going up to him and asking \\"How's yer mom doing?\\" and he either says fine or she'll be dying soon. For a while in the second half, we are led to believe she has terrets syndrome when she starts shouting and cursing at her TV screen. But that wouldn't cause her to be sick, is the thing. We all have some form of terrets. When we get mad...when Carl's Jr. puts out more of those \\"dumb guy\\" commercials, or when they outlaw those Paris Hilton ones. There are other parts of the movie that are nauseating, in all senses. This could be a perfectly good adult sports drama, but, alas, the movie had to appeal to teenagers by adding constant references to \\"getting laid\\" and doing drugs. Another thing that made me want to vomit was the camera work. It's not that it wasn't good, it was great, it was just a little too pretensious. The handheld camera technique worked in \\"Snatch\\", but not here. The picture comes off herky jerky and a little ugly. But, there are many more great aspects about the movie than there are bad. The acting is great, and some of the football scenes are truly intense, especially the last one, even though we all know what will happen. The end is one thing that brings this movie down from five star level. As we all think the team will win and we get ourselves geared up for it, they end up losing. I guess it is my fault because I didn't know the end already, but it was still a major let down. Director Peter Berg is much better at staging the more subdued scenes, such as two character talking. He falters, however, in scenes of cringe inducing sports violence that just make the movie a little better, yet a little harder to watch. Berg does stage one hilarious scene in a parking lot of the local drug store involving star Billy Bob Thorton, his wife and his daughter. This is not a suprise, since Berg's past credits include \\"The Rundown\\", and action-comedy, and \\"Very Bad Things\\", a very dark comedy. \\"Friday Night Lights\\" is an interesting drama, but there are a few too many scenes that try to be serious but instead are funny. Names of characters, like my good friend Boobie Miles, will cause laughs between pre-teens 10-12, probably. This is not a great movie, or at times even a good one, but it gets the job done in an entertaining, efficient way. It will appeal mostly to sports jocks, and maybe to their unfortunate girlfriends, wives, or significant others that they drag to this movie. I usually like any kind of movie, and I also assumed that I would like this one. I saw the first \\"Bridget Jones\\" the same day as I saw \\"Collateral\\" and loved them both. I thought that I may as well give this a try, even if the previews didn't make it look to great. While this movie is better than something like \\"Hoosiers\\", it's not as good as, say, \\"Million Dollar Baby\\". The ending of this one will leave you in the same, dark place that \\"M$B\\" left you, and it isn't sugar coated and cutsey like \\"Hoosiers\\" was. At times, \\"Friday Night Lights\\" takes itself a little too seriously. Scenes where the team practices feel like comic relief from the serious and stressfull other points of the movie. When a character cries, the acting in that scene is so overdone that one can't help but laugh.  <br /> <br />Thortan plays coach Gary Gaines, who has recently moved toOdessa, Texas to escape his losing streak. He starts the season anew, and he is hopeful with his many new players. Some, like Boobie (Derek Luke), are overly pompus. Others, like Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund), are abuses at home. Don is abused by his father, Charles Billingsley (Tim McGraw), who used to play for the same team as Don is now playing on. Charles wants Don to be what he could never be: great. Don resents him for that, and as a result, Charles gets drunk and yells at and hits him alot. Gaines teaches the kids how to respect their fellow teammates, and the movie follows that same old cliche ridden script. The team plays through the semi-finals, the finals, and finally makes it to the championship. This happens over a two hour five minute time span, and at times the movie feels overlong. It feels about 20 minutes too long. Usually, sports movies use their time wisely, there fore they are never that long. This particular film wastes some time (45 minutes or so) detailing how the players live, yet oddly, the characters are incredibly underdeveloped. <br /> <br />The movie takes a true story and spins it into a slightly fictional tale, one that makes it not more interesting, but more eccentric, in a strange way. The characters are never fully developed, and as the movie progresses we keep thinking that they will be developed more, or at least in fuller detail. Unfortunately, that never happens, and we are left on our own to figure something out about these characters. Not every single one is not developed. Gaines, Boobie, Charles, Don, and Gaines' wife are all fully developed. That will have to do, though, since nothing else in the movie, or anyone else for that matter, is explained that well. This movie is a dissapointment because it could have been so much more. So much more dramtic, so much more funny, so much more game oriented. Oh. Sorry. The movie is game oriented, and fatally so. The film, after a while, begins to feel like a bunch of different games and practices strung together with placement titles on the bottom of the screen. It probably feels like this because the movie really is just a bunch of games and practices after a while. \\"Friday Night Lights\\" shows just how obsessed this town is with its games, and it does it well with montages of stores with signs that read \\"Gone To The Game\\", and how it shows the packed stadiums is truly breathtaking. \\"Friday Night Lights\\" is well done in so many ways. Too many to mention. But it is also fatally flawed in just as many ways. Sad, in a way, since this movie had real potential. Real, genuine, special potential that it squanders mostly in its last half hour. Sorry Billy Bob, you were better in \\"Bad Santa\\". <br /> <br /> <br />
B000001DZQ|5.0|And what a beautiful house it was (sad he didn't get to live in it AFTER it was seriously recognized).  I saw him once in a very small venue in St. Louis in the mid-80's (I was 10 feet away), not too long before he died from an alleged suicide.  He did seem sad in a way and a bit spaced dealing with the crowd energy, but his brilliant soulfull playing knocked me out that night.  He shot right up to the top of my favorite guitar players list for a long while after that, and I have seen many a concert (I often cranked up my guitar to the few albums of his I have).  I got this when it came out to have some cd's of his material and because it is a pretty good overview from what I can tell.  I am still not completely familiar with his whole catalogue of material, but he really shows incredible diversity on these songs.  Recently I took the time to play guitar with the whole deal straight through and at the end I was very satisfied that this guitar man should be played more often (I listen to so much music that it is hard to keep up with everything).  Some of the songs are more straight forward, but many of them are worked up to a psychedelic frenzy that even Hendrix or Beck would take notice.  There are moments (long ones)of sheer brilliance interspersed through many songs, esp. disk 2 (his later albums are the more intense guitar oriented ones I believe).  I didn't take exact notes as to what exact section twisted my noodle, but there were many. There are some songs missing I love from other albums, but there are plenty of others to make up for it!  Anyone who loves smokin' guitar (or just great songs played well) will find this or others of his to be well worth owning - trust me!  Green Onions never tasted so good!
B0007OCG56|4.0|I rented this DVD when nothing else appealed to me and I am glad I did. It shows the clash of cultures, when the Mexican housekeeper and her daughter become part of the wacky Clasky family. The two teenage girls' acting was wonderful.....and then there was Tea Leoni, whose manic depiction of Deborah was exhausting to watch and hit all the right notes.<br /><br />I think that it was a mistake to market this movie as a comedy when it is really a family story with some comedic moments, and touched on some important issues without ever being preachy.<br /><br />Well done.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|The concert was as good as I expected it. All four of the members held up really well. I enjoyed the new Glenn Frey song a lot. There is something about his voice combined with Henley's and Timothy B.'s that elevates solo-Eagle songs to a different level. On the NBC special Henley made the point that all solos songs could have easily been Eagles songs anyway and he is right. <br /> <br />If you like this DVD, go to the music section and look up the listings for Poco. Last year Poco released a CD/DVD package that is only 13.99 on Amazon. The title you need to find is \\"Keeping the Legend Alive\\". You get a great concert DVD as well as a CD for the car. Many of you who like the Eagles will love this combo and you will also be surprised at the number of songs you actually know.  Back in the late sixties and early seventies, when Glenn Frey was fresh off the stagecoach from Detroit, he used to sit at the foot of the stage at the Troubadour in LA and watch Poco perform. Richie Furay, Rusty Young and the others created the template for much of what the Eagles were able to do. Poco didn't rise to the heights that the Eagles did, but they provided a lot of inspiration and are a crucial step in the evolution of country and rock.  Both of the bass players in the Eagles actually came from Poco.  <br /> <br />Since both groups share killer harmonies and great songs, why did the Eagles go on to become such giants and Poco didn't?  Poco lacked Frey's sense of Detroit R&B. That was the key ingredient (IMHO). Well, that and a very, very aggressive management team.
B00005JMJG|1.0|A sleeper in the sense that it made me doze off!!!<br /><br />What a waste of time. I only finished watching it because my son was watching it with me and he actually liked it!<br /><br />I thought it was pretentious, incoherent, and plodding. The so-called plot was ludicrous and contrived. It was way too strange for this viewer.<br /><br />I have taken to calling this movie \\"Eternally Mindless\\", which would seem to be a better title.<br /><br />Skip this stinker!
B0001XAPY2|5.0|I've been a Miyazaki fan since the late 80s, but I just enjoyed Porco Rosso for the first time. As I've only seen it once, I won't say much, but I have to add another 5 stars for this fantasmagoric film. Over the years, many reviews have touted this film as one of his best, if not his best. It could be. And that's saying a lot. The animation is absolutely magical: mesmerizing and exciting. The magical realisn is right on: think Gabriel Garcia Marquez at his best. The plot and characters are compelling. This film delivers everything the often misused animation medium promises: the creation of a reality at once real and fantastic. By the way, I prefer the Japanese voices to the dub, and not for anime purist reasons. It's just that Keaton's voice is too soft and tenor for the character. The Japanese actor's voice is dead on. This is a great movie.
B00003CXXS|2.0|I gave this movie 2 stars only because I love the dinosaurs and the first two movies. I have tried to view JP3 as entertainment and not be cynical, but I have had a hard time because there are so many questions. <br />1.)If this is the same island as \\"The Lost World\\", where did the landing strip come from? <br />2.)Um, was the Spinosaurus hibernating in \\"The Lost World\\"?If he was, that may make sense, but why has he not interacted with the Trex before? <br />3.)After 8 weeks, A teenage boy can defeat raptors AND save Dr. Grant who has survived an island of dinosaurs already? How did the boy get his food? If no one was on that island for 4 years, then the food in that trailer would be old and unedible....even beans. <br />4.)Why didn't Dr. Grant wait for the check to be cleared before he agreed to go to the Island?   <br />5.) I would havebeen satisfied in the end if the families of the three men sue THAT IRRITATING COUPLE for causing the men to lose their lives, even though they agreed to go. The couple was too annoying and stubborn! <br /> <br />I still would go see the fourth installment if there will be one. After all, anything would be better that JP3.
0553573411|4.0|Robin Hobb has created another good installment that grabs ahold of you and keeps you reading.  You feel for the characters, you feel their pain, pleasure, happiness, loneliness, you have sympathy for them.  This isn't to say that the characters are not stretched a little thin sometimes, but you overlook that by how Hobb writes. <br /> <br />One downside to this, and thus four star, is that Hobb seems to have written herself into a corner and had to end the book as best she could.  The ending is a little for wanting because it seems especially far fetched.  She does explain it away, so it does work on a small scale, but I wish it would have ended better (and yet it still evoked emotion). <br /> <br />Despite the disappointing (almost, but not complete disappointment) ending I would still run out and get her final installment.  Her writing draws you in and leaves you wanting more, and you can't ask for anything better than that.
0689835604|5.0|My Daughter recieved this book for her first birthday and she still loves it. It's actually VERY sturdy for being a lift the flap book the flaps are sealed across the entire top or bottom of the page in about a half inch strip and are made out of a heavy cardstock type paper not quite board thick but still rather thick.  <br /> <br />We let her play with all her books whenever she wants even if it means possibly eventually destroying them and this book has stood up very very well. It's over ten months old and has lost only ONE flap and only very recently. She still loves it regardless.  <br /> <br />The drawings are cute the words are big and clear (we're starting to try to get her to follow along with the words we say by pointing them out). It's a bit short, but right now it doesn't seem to matter she'll read it twice through if she wants more and sometimes it's just the right length.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|It is now clearly impossible to me that this album could exist:  The boundaries of the world have never imagined such a thing.   <br />(-P.S. Cedric Bixler-Zavala is the greatest poet of our time.)  <br />(-P.P.S. Omar A. Rodriguez-Lopez is also the greatest poet of our time.)  <br />(-P.P.S. These titles give boundaries to something so ineffable that I disbelieve in its existence, you must forgive my folly.)
B00097A5I6|4.0|First off, if you're a fan of Oasis, you'll like the change.  If you're a fan of good music, you'll like the change.  If you're a fan of good guitar bands, you'll like the change.   <br /> <br />But, if you're hoping this album will indeed resurrect Oasis' popularity in the states to the mid 90's level, then you'll be dissapointed.  <br /> <br />Suffice to say, the Gallagher's have seemingly moved on from trying to make music for the masses, as they stumbled into with 'Whats the Story', and tried to follow up with 'Be Here Now'.  And that allows for a better brand of music to be made, as evident by this newest album.  <br /> <br />Quick rundown on the music ... aside from 'Lyla' (#3), 1-4 are repetitive songs that try to do something different with the sound, but end up mundane and repetitive.  From five on, its brilliant ... thats all you've got to know going in, if you care to know even that.  <br /> <br />The whole album is just a nice, individual change, with more influences taken from the Stones or Sgt. Pepper's than anything else.  It comes out increasingly more unique than past albums, and musically very, very good.  If I wasn't so familiar with Oasis, it could easily pass as an album of a newer band concerned solely with making good guitar music on an indy label, rather than a huge group, playing to the masses.  The biggest surprise, and best song on the album ... the brother's finely crafted duet 'Let There Be Love' (#11).  <br /> <br />I'm quite happy with the new sound.  <br /> <br />
0898705525|5.0|There are very few writers I can remember who have a wit and a mastery of words equal to Chesterton's (Annie Dillard is just about the only one I can think of). For that reason alone, Orthodoxy is worth reading for just about any lover of words, believer of not. He has the most extraordinary way of saying the most absurd things that are also perfectly logical. He says those obvious things that had never struck you before, and it's utter sublimity when you happen upon those moments in this text. Of course, Chesterton's whole goal in writing this book is to provide that sort of insight. Perhaps the most adventuresome, the most true way of looking at the world and of living in this world is the very old way that's been sitting right in front of us all the time, orthodox Christianity. It may sound crazy. Certainly, \\"mystery\\" and \\"adventure\\" aren't words that always spring to mind when one thinks of Christianity, but they should be. Chesterton's the sort of writer that can make Christianity seem like something new. This isn't a perfect book, but it's close. And it should be a must-read for everyone.
B00000JHAU|3.0|Belle and Sebastian (on this album) are very, very, very melancholy. It's as if they're trapped inside \\"Eleanor Rigby\\"...not the song...actually BEING \\"Eleanor\\". I say this because they never step back and become detached from the sadness...they just allow it to swallow them whole and this continual focus on the downside of life tends to be wearing over the course of a whole album. Couple this with the limited range of the lead singer and influences (Smiths,Donovan) worn clearly on their sleeve and it becomes apparent that this is one of those albums people listen to so they can assure themselves of the superiority of \\"indie\\" music rather than out of any basis in the music itself.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />This one is extremely overrated. If you want a better B&S album, try BOY WITH THE ARAB STRAP or DEAR CATASTROPHE WAITRESS first. Those are more musically accessible and don't fall prey as often to flowery pretension.
0767802519|5.0|It was only by accident that I caught this movie showing on television.  If it was released theatrically, I never saw it.  Which is a shame, for this is an excellent movie.  Well written and well acted, this is a must-see film for anyone who likes suspense and adventure. <br /> <br />Natalie Portman plays a young girl who is the only witness to a mass murder.  The killer is a policeman.  Leon, an excellent French actor, plays a professional assassin whose only companions are a green plant and his contact, played by Danny Aiello.  His is a lonely life until the little girl comes to him for safety.  She doesn't give him much choice in the matter. <br /> <br />Grateful to him, and fascinated by his way of life, she begins to learn his trade, with great alacrity.  More than once they are forced by circumstances to move from their apartment, always taking the plant, careful not to damage it.  Always in the back of her mind, though, is the policeman who killed her family.  Her desire for vengeance and the growing love between her and the assassin, complicate their lives, leading to a final, explosive confrontation. <br /> <br />The characters are well-drawn and sympathetic.  The story line is interesting from beginning to end, and very believable. <br /> <br />Viewers who find this movie interesting might also enjoy Gloria with Gena Rowlands.
B000002KJQ|5.0|Yup. Some say it's Fandango or their early 80s crap, but it's not. <br />Fandango is okay but the fact of being half-live, half studio album makes it lose to Tres Hombres. <br /> <br />All songs blend perfectly. My favorites are La Grange, Waitin' for the bus, Jesus just left Chicago, Hot, blue and righteous and Shiek (By the way, somebody explain to me what on earth is that). Not that I dislike the others, of course.  <br /> <br />About the drum sound, I don't remember how the vinyl sounded but I guess people are right when bashing it here. Ro Grande Mud seems to have a more natural drum sound. <br /> <br />The only bad aspect of Tres Hombres is being too short (33 mins). You want to press the repeat button before playing it. <br /> <br />5/5.
B0007GAERG|5.0|MC was never hig on my list of favorite female singers but this album is fantastic.  That annoying falsetto/whisper thing she had going for a while is gone and the powerful full voice is back.  Each song is a hit!  Get it if you don't have it.
B0000029AL|5.0|Aerosmith has always been one of my favorite bands and this CD is one of their best!  I think Aerosmith in their early years captured the essence of what rock and roll is all about!  Every track on this CD is pure rock and roll!  The band just jells!  The chemistry between the group members is pure magic!  It only happens to a few bands and this is one of those times!  These guys are like brothers and when they disbanded briefly in the seventies..even though they tried the fill the holes with other bandmates it just didn't work.. <br /> <br />Steven, Joe, Brad, Tom and Joey will forever be Aerosmith and if you ever want to read a great rock biography check out \\"Walk This Way\\"..it tells a great story about how the guys got together and slaved in clubs perfecting their style before hitting it big..Joey Kramer came up with the name for the group and it fits perfectly!  They are like a fine tuned jet plane!! <br /> <br />One Way Street is probably my favorite track on this CD..it kicks!!  The sound is pure..some of their later eighties stuff kind of left me wishing they would go back to their roots..but this CD and Get Your Wings and Toys in the Attic are their classic masterpieces!  For those of you who only know the later stuff you have to check these CDs out or you will be missing the best part of this legendary band!!
B0006Q1ULQ|2.0|You can tell by this book that Eco really knows his medieval lore, but the long rambling descriptions become tiresome about halfway through. The only other Eco book I have read was \\"The Name of the Rose\\" which I enjoyed immensely. I was hoping that this book would be as gripping but instead I found the plot to be convoluted and occasionally the story veered off into sub plots that seemed to have no bearing on the actual story. I found myself skimming over big sections near the end in an attempt to get to the conclusion. After I finally finished this book, I wished I had put it down a lot sooner and just started on something that was actually worth my time.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Martin Scorsese's wonderfully filmed biopic of Hughes' early years is a wonderfully stylish film which captures the eccentric billionaire as he begins to develop his strangely bizarre behavior..I think Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job of acting in this film and truly captured the essence of Hughes..even down to his mannerisms..he definitely did his homework!  Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Kate Hepburn was brilliant!  It's amazing how Cate captured Hepburn's voice and mannerisms..she surely deserved her Oscar win!  I have read several biographies on Hughes and Scorsese stays pretty close to the truth..The crash of Hughes' experimental plane in the film is amazing!  One wonders how the film makers were able to put this together so realistically!    It's been quite a while since Hollywood has dished out the bucks for such a wonderful looking film and they succeeded on all fronts in my opinion..watch some of the old films from that period and compare it to this film and you can see that detail was very important to Scorcese!  I think Kate Beckinsale's performance as Ava Gardner lacked a certain credibility but it was honest and forthright..This is Leonardo's picture though..    Although the film didn't win many awards it won the critic's praise..Especially Roger Ebert..he gave it 4 stars!  I found his review to be pretty much on target..    It's strange that they ended the film right after Hughes made his test flight of the Spruce Goose..it would have been interesting to see him in his later years..who knows..maybe Scorcese is saving all that for a followup..or maybe not..since the box office wasn't that great from what I heard..    Great film though!  If you enjoy biopics this a sure winner!
B0001WTUH6|5.0|UNDERWORLD, watch this interesting battle between (not humans as one would think) but Vampires versus Lycans (werewolves)<br /><br />Selene (Kate Beckinsale of Pearl Harbor fame) is a Beautiful Vampire Soldier (Death Dealer) whose purpose is to hunt down and kill any Werewolves she comes across, until one day (or night it is always dark it seems) she comes across a human Micheal who the Lycans are trying to capture. Well of course she falls for this guy and the plot gets more intense as it moves along between betrayal, power struggles and internal conflict which brings the film to an interesting (and bloody of course) end.<br /><br />The setting is very dark and \\"gothic\\". It seems like it is always raining and cold looking (which adds to the feeling of this film). Costumes are also the type seen in the usual Gothic Vamp circles. Action scenes are pretty good as well (enter the Matrix).<br /><br />It was a sleeper hit in October 2003 and it continues to draw crowds of viewers. I saw the normal DVD (rented) and liked it so much I picked up the Extended version (2 DVD set unrated) it adds about 20 min more to the film and comes with some interesting extras. I particularly liked the documentary called Fangs or Fiction which touches on the history of Vampire, Werewolf Myths and Legends and even has an interview with a \\"real\\" Werewolf as well as two \\"real\\" Vampires.<br /><br />If you like Vampire movies (or Vampire stuff in general)or are into the Goth scene, this film will satisfy both (or are both the same? hmm...)<br /><br />I give it 5 stars, and look for a sequel in the next year or so.
B0001ZX0OW|3.0|In Boston, we follow three teen boys from adolescence to adulthood when they have families of their own.  Dave had been abducted in front of Jimmy and Sean, to be abused by an authority figure.  This haunted him (and them) as he was considered 'damaged goods.'  He killed a man after seeing him abuse a boy in a car, and almost got falsely accused of another murder.    It was well directed, but too much action took place at night in dark shadows.  They used the F-word too much.  Why do policemen have to use that word at any time -- for intimidation, I guess.  It detracted from the movie, which could have been good.  The acting was superb with Sean Penn taking home the Academy award as best actor and Tim Robbins as best supporting actor.      A lot of emotion and violence culminating with a useless murder of Jimmy's daughter, Kate, and its consequences.  We bury our pasts.  A king knows what to do.  He'd loved his oldest daughter much too much; she was the light in his eyes.  \\"The river has many depths.  Let it wash over you\\" as based on Dennis Lahane's novel.  A parade at the end signified the end of sordidness and misunderstanding and the end to boyhood rivalries.
B00005JNVS|5.0|Coming from horrible films like Cursed and Boogeyman, and incredibly violent features like Sin City, this movie was everything I expected and more. The graphics are amazing, the fight scenes are fun, and the movie itself is hilarious. In fact, there was a scene in the movie that drove me into tears, I was laughing so hard. It doesn't really have a whole lot of violent scenes; the worst part, really, is when one character spills a cup of saki (?) and Brother Sum takes his hatchet right across the top part of his head. (And even that scene could have been worse!) But this is still an all-around great movie, and even if you don't like it - you still have to admit the awesomeness the fight scenes.
B0007DAZW8|4.0|Being a huge fan of euro dance music, I fell in love with this cd when I first listened to my friend's copy in her car...I was dancing in my seat from the first track. The whole purpose of Daft Punk is to make you want to get up and dance, and this cd accomplishes that purpose. (Though \\"Make Love\\" is the exception...too slow) This cd is excellent, better than Homework and even Discovery if you ask me. The fact that it's so different from the same boring old pop or hip -hop stuff that's overplayed on the radio ad nausea is specifically what makes this cd pure genius. <br />
B000022TSH|5.0|Sheer cinematic perfection. Roman Polanski's  total mastery of direction and details. Jack Nicholson at his sexiest with an unmatched cool ( a far cry from the scene-stealing ham/clown  since the 80's)and the ultra divine Faye Dunaway at her most mysterious as the glamorously dangerous  Evelyn Mulwray who is living with a startling secret. The best art direction, cinematography and the higest production. A classic  noir experience filled with intrigue and a solid plot.
1400034779|5.0|I absoutely loved this book.  The Lady Detective (Precious Ramotswe) is one of  the most charming, smart and savvy characters to grace the pages of a novel in a long while.  The writing is so colorful that you can imagine that you are riding along with Precious in her \\"little white van\\" across Botswana or wherever her detective adventures take her.  Out of a need for work, Precious opens a detective agency.  He clients run the gamet from those who don't have a lot of money to those who live behind gated walls and own several businesses.  She takes on all clients-as long as they don't want her to do anything illegal.  She solves the cases with determination, grit and yes, a little luck.  Precious is a very strong, yet kind and compassionate person.  There are so many mean and unkind characters in novels now, it is refreshing  to see someone writing a  novel with such a nice central character.  I have already bought the next three novels in No.1 Ladies series and am looking forward to reading them as well.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Farewell I - Live From Melbourne is a classic in the making.  It features the Eagles (Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Joe Walsh and Timothy B. Schmit), filmed live in Melbourne, Australia in November 2004.  The energy of the group live today actually exceeds that of their initial success in the 70's, and they deliver a tight, polished performance that's sure to please everyone from the casual Eagles fan to the die-hard.  All the hits are here: Hotel California, Take It Easy, The Long Run, Desperado, One Of These Nights, and many more.  Also featured are two new Eagles tracks, Glenn Frey's beautiful ballad \\"No More Cloudy Days,\\" and Joe Walsh's very personal and moving \\"One Day At A Time.\\"  The DVD also is set to include rare backstage footage, interview segments, and commentary from the band members themselves on the various songs.  I've been lucky enough to see the Eagles play live 10 times, and this captures them like nothing else that's commercially available.  If you liked Hell Freezes Over, you'll be blown away by Melbourne.  This is a must-have DVD.
0440237688|4.0|I loved this book in the begining and in the middle. The way the society is described is amazing and well written. I expected the end to be great and clear up some of the mystery. BUT I never would have guessed such a cliff-hanger! It didn't tell you anything at all. Cliff-hangers are good in a series, or at the end of a chapter. NOT at the end of the book! It leaves too much to guess. I hated the ending but the rest of the book was good. I definently recommend it.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|After viewing the program on TV, I have to say it was the best concert I've seen the Eagles perform.  It was great to re-live their best hits and hear the newer ones... this is a MUST HAVE!
B00097DX3U|2.0|If you're a fan of Chris Cornell and Soundgarden, I can imagine you'll love Audioslave's newest CD \\"Out of Exile\\".   <br />If you were a huge fan of the hip-hop meets hard-rock band Rage Against the Machine, you may not really like this album.   <br /> <br />I was sort of so-so on this new Audioslave cd.  Nothing really stood out and struck me aside the head and made me take attention.  It's good straight ahead rock, but it left me wanting something more. <br /> <br />Also, Tom Morello sounds horribly out of place solo'ing on a lot of the songs.  This album now sounds like it is truly Chris Cornell's band, not really Rage meets Chris Cornell.   <br /> <br />Many people may like Audioslave and I can understand why, but for me, this was just alright.  2.5 stars.
0385720920|5.0|First book I read by Chuck.  Best book I read by Chuck.  I've read all of his books (currently 1/2 through Haunted) if I was to re-read a book it would be Choke then Survivor. <br /> <br />I don't normally read much, and most books i find myself reading cause i'm bored or something, this was one of the few books i told my friends i was busy so i could finish the book.  Have let 3 friends borrow it, they all have loved it to; its a chick magnet (ok maybe not). <br /> <br />Can learn alot about human nature, and about how everbody has to have a hobby. <br />See also.  Collecting Rocks <br />See also.  Masturbation <br />See also.  Reading Chuck
B00080ZG10|4.0|I went into this thinking a 170 minute film about Howard Hughes couldn't be that interesting.  Boy, was I wrong!  This film is another masterpiece by Scorsese - not only does he break out of his main genre (gangsters/mafia/crime dramas), but the film also has next to no violence (his trademark), and STILL he delivers the goods.    The film does a wonderful job of bringing us back to the times.  Cameos and supporting performances by the likes of Willem Dafoe, Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, and Cate Blanchett (who plays Katherine Hepburn) are outstanding (Alda and Blanchett were nominated for Oscars; Baldwin - whose character is quite sinister and intense - easily could've been as well).      Everything lends to a complex, interesting, and entertaining story.  However, honorable mention MUST go to Leonardo DiCaprio.    Playing a larger-than-life character like Howard Hughes is a difficult challenge and a film like this either sinks or swims on the performance of the lead actor.  However, DiCapprio MORE than treads water.     I have never been a DiCapprio fan.  But his performance in this movie is undeniably powerful.  It is emotionally-draining and quite sad to watch DiCaprio, who \\"becomes\\" Hughes in this picture; capable of such great, wonderful things - a genius in every right - yet ultimately torn apart by his inner demons and mental illness.  What a life Hughes led.  What an incredible story!    If this film has a weak spot, it would be the length - but still, I have to admire Scorsese for not compromising on his vision (he was urged to cut the film down, but refused).      In short, a damn good picture, well worthy of the 11 Oscar nominations it received.  That is was beat out by that dull Eastwood boxing flick for Best Picture is a travesty.
0345440900|1.0|I borrowed this book from a friend, and I found it to be just rediculous!  My biggest gripe with this book is that the author calls herself a lactation consultant, then seems to ignore many scientific facts about breastfeeding.   <br /> <br />First she seems to discount all of the differences between breastfeeding and formula feeding.  I dont fault women who choose to formula feed because that is their choice, but lets not kid ourselves here.  breast milk is best, and there is no way around that.  The author never seems to explain the good things about breastfeeding, only the difficult aspects of it.  This part of the book acutally made me feel angry, because I felt she was almost discouraging women from doing it.  Sure its difficult at first, but most things worth doing in life are.  I also found some points very deceptive.  At one point she says that while breastfeeding helps a woman get back to her pre-baby weight, she has to keep on 5-10 pounds to ensure the baby is getting enough nutrition.  That is crazy!!  No doctor or lactation consultant I have seen has told me to keep on extra wieght; just to take in more calories.  In fact, I was back to my original weight after 6 weeks (thanks to breastfeeidng alone, i made no other effort whatsoever), and my baby is in the 95th percentile for her weight.   <br /> <br />Another aspect of this book that I found silly was that the author tells us to \\"Envision yourself drawing a circle around your baby...his personal space...Never enter your baby's circle of respect without asking permission, tellling him why you want to come in and what you're doing.\\"  I think that pretty much sums up how silly and rediculous this book is.  I would probably use the word \\"new-age\\" to describe some of these teachings.  Im glad I just borrowed it and didnt pay for it myself.
B00000JZC4|5.0|This album is amazing actually. I listen to some really heavy music(check my other reviews to understand) and I really love how this album settles me. Synth textures make this band awesome. The strict producing of the album makes it so incredibly streamlined. The track Cancer is one of my absolute favorite songs. This cd is wonderful, you will be pleased.
0780619951|4.0|Ever wonder where Col. Kurtz would've ended up had he survived the end of &#34;Apocalypse Now&#34;? Well, now we know: He exiled himself to a deserted island to create humanimals -- the horror, the horror.<br /><br />The 1996 version of &#34;The Island of Dr. Moreau&#34; was such a troubled production that articles, books and documentaries have been made about it, like the 2014 documentary &#34;Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau.&#34; Stanley championed the project and wrote the screenplay, but was fired after a few days of filming due to conflicts with Val Kilmer, who wasn't in the best of moods due to being served divorce papers while on set. The production was so bad that Fairuza Balk (the cat-lady, Aissa) literally tried to escape the set, but was caught at the airport in the nick of time. Add to this Brando's well-known eccentricities - not helped by the recent suicide of his daughter, Cheyenne (!) - and constant rewrites and you have a formula for cinematic chaos!<br /><br />In light of the horrible production and the ensuing bad press you would think this would be a lousy movie, but it's actually not that bad. I can see WHY some people don't like it because parts of the third act are pretty insane and don't flow very well, but if you're a sucker for lost-on-an-island type yarns and appreciate the mood & insanity of films like &#34;Apocalypse Now&#34; and the original &#34;Planet of the Apes&#34; (&#34;It's a madhouse, a MADHOUSE!&#34;) you'll probably appreciate it. Don't get me wrong, it's nowhere near the caliber of either of those films, but comparisons are inevitable and it IS entertaining despite its flaws.<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The flow of the movie seems off and, as such, the story isn't that compelling, which is mostly apparent in the mounting craziness of the third act, which tempts the viewer to tune out. However, it's not THAT bad.<br /><br />WHAT WORKS: The title sequence is kinetic and dazzling, perhaps one of the best in the history of cinema; the score by Gary Chang is varied and all-around phenomenal ('nuff said); the plot is intriguing; the humanimal make-up and actors are quite good with Daniel Rigney's 'Hyena-Swine' standing out (Rigney would be dead a mere year after the film's release); the movie possesses an undeniable creative pizazz; Marlon Brando's 35-minute stint is as captivating as always; the inclusion of Dr. Moreau's &#34;Mini-Me&#34; is hilarious in hindsight of the Austin Powers trilogy; and there are definite flashes of greatness, like Edward's revelatory talk with Aissa in the third act.<br /><br />Marlon's Dr. Moreau is a variation of Kurtz (i.e. nutjob in the jungle), albeit twenty years later. For Brando fans it's enjoyable seeing him in his old age. This was one of his final films and it shows that he had his magnetic charm until the end.<br /><br />Furthermore, there are some interesting themes if you look closely: The humanimals who get to live in Dr. Moreau's abode are more human-like in appearance than the animals living in the smelly humanimal 'village' in the forest; the most human-like one, Aissa, he even refers to as his daughter. Wouldn't this lead to tensions between the factions? While Moreau is a benevolent dictator he's still a dictator and dictator's are rarely good. When Hyena-Swine usurps the crown he immediately becomes a malevolent dictator.<br /><br />The original version runs 96 minutes and the DC 99 minutes. The film was shot in Cairns, Queensland, Australia.<br /><br />GRADE: B-nema; the score by Gary Chang is varied and all-around phenomenal ('nuff said); the plot is intriguing; the humanimal make-up and actors are quite good with Daniel Rigney's 'Hyena-Swine' standing out (Rigney would be dead a mere year after the film's release); the movie possesses an undeniable creative pizazz; Marlon Brando's 35-minute stint is as captivating as always; the inclusion of Dr. Moreau's &#34;Mini-Me&#34; is hilarious in hindsight of the Austin Powers trilogy; and there are definite flashes of greatness, like Edward's revelatory talk with Aissa in the third act.

B00097DX3U|3.0|Depending on who you are or what components of Audioslave you like will determine if you like \\"Out of Exile\\".  I like to call the first album Soundgarden Against the Machine, while this album is Rage Against the Soundgarden.  On this album, the Rage Against The Machine sound takes center stage with bland single note \\"hooks\\" that rarely impress or grab your attention.  Gone are Chris Cornell's anthemic rock chops...in it's place is sparse sounding Rage Rock.  If you like Rage more than Soundgarden, this will surely be something you'll like.   <br /> <br />Each song, except for the two singles \\"Be Yourself\\" and \\"Your Time Has Come\\" plods along with little excitement and then peaks with a Tom Morello sonic explosion.  It's a great formula, but it was far better executed on the debut album.  I miss Chris Cornells frothy growl on this album.  I believe he's had some vocal strain issues in the past, so maybe he couldn't do so much screaming on this album. <br /> <br />The album opens strong with \\"Your Time Has Come\\", very similar riffs musically to Cochise on the first album, both very good songs.  The title track is slow and uninspired followed by \\"Be Yourself\\", the true standout single of the album. <br /> <br />The rest of the tracks are well, good, but not great.  I won't call this a sophomore flop because there's plenty of decent music here, but you won't find 5-6 singles like the first album.   Hopefully next time (if there is a next time) they'll come back out with another rocking album that fuses the two bands more fluently.  It was a decent effort and I'm glad I bought it.
B000268QB2|5.0|The Amazon Editorial review stated \\"they manage to squeeze an epic-sounding poignancy from their stripped-down sound (a lot of this is due to the album's superb production)\\"<br /><br />I'll completely agree with the first part of that statement - they do produce an incredibly \\"big\\" sound for being a 3-piece band. However, I just saw them live at a small venue, and Keane sounds as good live as they do on the CD.
B000929AJQ|5.0|(...)    From raging Industrial to sexy gospel to Pink Floydian piano balladry to quirky spoken word,With Teeth is a diverse bag of tricks.All tied together by Mr Reznor's brutal honesty.    The album opens with a haunting ode to loneliness over a sticky drum and bass line.As an isolated person observes how \\"all the insects march along/seem to know just right where they belong\\".But the song grows more intense with every line.Once the keyboards come in,the song turns into a gospel.With Trent seemingly asking God himself why does he get \\"All the Love in  the World ?\\".Only shallow simpletons wouldnt see how deep and profound Mr Reznor's question is.Some people are unable to comprehend deep thought so they label anything this dark \\"teen angst\\".I'm sure some fools called Ludwig Van Beethoven the same when his symphonies became darker.    Then,the brutal industrial sludge kicks in for \\"You Know What You Are ?\\".NIN at their angriest.The song reminds me very much of Broken.But instead of Trent venting against his reord label,now its his manager.Same honesty.    \\"The Collector\\" is covered in the smoothest and funkiest bassline.The lyrics seem to be about the part  in us that cleans up after our mistakes.Another great song.    other highlights include the sexy  \\"Sunspots\\",the darkly comical retro talky \\"Only\\",the haunted and haunting \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" and the anthemic ode to a routine life \\"Everyday Is Exactly The Same\\".    The title track is also great.Like in the best songs off The Downward Spiral,Trent uses sex as a metaphor for addiction.The song is creepy and memorable at the same time.    to the foolish individuals who seem to suggest that  the Reznorman sold out-you are Incorrect!Yes,Trent is playing it a bit safer then on the Fragile.But he also doesnt want NIN to end up on J Records with Pearl Jam.    Reznor's tormented soul hasnt gotten a happy age facelift for the mainstream on With Teeth.Its still the words of an angry introvert mocking all the insects marching along.Still singing in disgust \\"There is so many of them it gets hard to breath\\" on the \\"Collector\\". Still feeling like \\"an animal in his cage\\" on \\"Right Where It Belongs\\".    Like The Cure and Depeche Mode,NIN is still a dark soundscape with moments of light.And for that I'm glad.Because not all of us want to hear about peace and love and faith after the age of 30.Some of us finding that \\"Love Is Not Enough\\".

B00005ATQ9|4.0|If you enjoy immersion, then BL is the movie for you. Unfortunately, many people with postmodern sensibilities won't \\"get\\" it: it is slow paced, pensive, and nearly three hours in length. Despite the fame of the director, this gem of a movie remains relatively unknown and very underrated. Its most striking aspect is the cinematography - at times BL feels like a Renaissance painting in motion; but, make no mistake about it, BL is truly remarkable on all levels.

B0000X61UU|5.0|I love this video and Cindy's first video (in spite of the safety criticisms) because they are more geared towards the types of workouts you would participate in as an athlete.  I've never enjoyed aerobics (okay, I actually hate them!), but these exercises remind me of the sorts of conditioning exercises we'd do in basketball, softball, and volleyball practices growing up.  If you were someone who enjoyed those types of workouts, I'd recommend this video.
B00097A5I6|5.0|I'm a real Oasis fan so I don't really think they even make a bad song; I like all of their music.  A really different sound for Oasis and a really solid showing.  The world of music has never been as bad as it is now.  Rock isn't very fashionable.  Instead we have to put up with boy bands, hot chicks who can't sing, half naked women in videos(which isn't too bad), rap isn't what it used to be and I don't even listen to the radio anymore.  MTV practically helped kill good music lately.  It's rare a good cd comes out anymore and this is a great one.  And non Oasis fans need to quite writing reviews on here; you don't have taste in music and you don't listen to them anyways so quite writing about them.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Being on the road all the time I never caught much of the series when it was on the History Channel.  After seing the last two chapters though I had to buy the set and see what the entire story was about.  I can honestly say I more than got my money's worth on this set. <br /> <br />I could go on and rave about all the fine merits of the series, but apparently there's been so many great reviews that any more would most likely get lost in the shuffle.  So I'll just say this to anyone who might be sitting on the fence about buying the set....It's so real and so rich in acting and script that you get many more times the bang for your bucks....
B000929AJQ|1.0|I eagerly awaited this album.  I loved Pretty Hate Machine.  I loved The Fragile.  Even the half of The Downward Spiral that I hated, I still appreciated because of the inventiveness and general feeling of Trent pushing the envelope.  I have tried and tried to like this new album, but it just bores me and Trent's lyrics are the worst of his career.  I am curious if all the people that have given this album great reviews are still wild about the album now that it has been out for awhile.  The only good thing that I can say is that most of the songs remind me of better NIN songs from the past.  I've listened to the older songs again.  They are much better.  Trent has spent his career redefining himself right up until this album.  I hope he goes back to his daring ways.

0141439831|4.0|This book is intriguing, despite its flaws.  It's entertaining, thought-provoking and if it were more believable, it might be a bit didactic.   <br /> <br />My problem is that I couldn't find a character that I could relate to in even the slightest way.  Becky is evil.  George is a jerk.  Rawdon has no personality at all, nor does Dobbins (who could be the hero if he had a personality).  I tried to like Amelia, but despite her integrity and her good heart, she is just too dumb.  The rest of the characters are too quirky and transient to even consider.   <br /> <br />I think Thackeray wrote with a lot of insight into human nature, but the characters were not drawn very well and they do things that they wouldn't really do.  To contrast, Jane Austen's Emma, though filled with faults, is entirely likable because her thoughts and actions are human and easy to relate to.  Reading \\"Vanity Fair\\", I was constantly saying to myself, \\"Why did she do this?\\" and \\"Why didn't he do that?\\"  But maybe that's what Thackeray intended.   <br /> <br />One thing I liked about it was what I take to be the theme: that sometimes, the thing you think you want more than anything else in the world turns out to be \\"not worth having\\".  Indeed, every character in this novel learns that lesson and we all learn it sooner or later in life.  If you look at the parallels drawn between characters, this shines through and, although the characters don't seem to learn much from it, the reader does.   <br /> <br />I was captivated throughout the 700+ pages and that is another redeeming factor.  I learned a little about Waterloo and the Napoleon years, and about London and Paris society during that time.  It is worth reading and that's why I give it 4 stars, but it's not in my top 10 Victorian novels.

He makes the exotic and runway looks so accessible to everyone. Some good brushes, a perfectly matched foundation and your face becomes a palette.

All my girlfriends have borrowed it already and we look more fabulous than ever!
B0006VIE4C|2.0|Apparently not.  First of all it was called Star Wars.  Isn't Mr. Lucas rich enough?  I have not been able to find the original version from 1977 on dvd, you know what that mean Mr. Lucas, it means you don't get my money. I don't want the new edition of a classic film.  Time to get a life and move on George.  It is a shame that such a talented director got stuck for so long on the same theme.  So many from Hollywood have opinions about corporate greed, well they should know.  New versions of old movies, new scenes, changed scenes, basically a different film.   Spielberg has the same problem.  Making new movies is great but changing past movies and ensuring that you can't get the original reminds me of what George Orwell said about controlling the future by rewriting the past.  Lucas should know better.  Some day they will be doing this with history if they aren't already.   That's why we are moving to a paperless society.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Although I have a couple of major complaints (more of that below) about SMALLVILLE, there is no question that the producers have framed the show with a fascinating premise. I grew up reading the Superman comics, but try as I might, I could never get excited about the Superboy stories. Little Clark Kent was basically the adult Superman in a smaller body with a flying dog. SMALLVILLE, however, features Clark Kent as Superman-in-progress, in possession of some of his powers, lacking in others, and developing as a person. This not-quite version of Superman is a great variation on the Superman legend. Even better is the show's take on Lex Luthor, changing him from a James Bond-like super villain into a complex, conflicted, troubled young man attempting to escape the influence of his ruthless entrepreneur father Lionel Luthor. In Season One, Lex is someone who is largely trying to be a better person than he has been, someone trying to escape his familial destiny, and striving to be a good friend to the slightly younger Clark Kent, who he meets when Clark saves him from drowning after his car crashes into a river. Both in the producers' conception of Lex and in the exceptional performance by Michael Rosenbaum, Lex Luthor develops into the most interesting character on the show.<br /><br />In fact, the entire regular cast of SMALLVILLE adds a great deal to the show as a whole, with the exception of the thankless job assigned to Eric Johnson of playing the \\"fifth wheel\\" (i.e., Lana Lang's boyfriend Whitney Fordman) in the series. Kristin Kreuk, who is an absolutely impossibly cute young woman, is beyond perfect as Lana Lang, the object of Clark's affection. The former Bo Duke, John Schneider, is convincing as Clark's dad, and Annette O'Toole is just as fine as his mother. Allison Mack is a great addition to the Superman back-story as Clark's close friend Chloe. And in the most crucial role, Tom Welling, though tending a bit to woodenness in his acting at times, is pretty much everything you could hope for as Clark.<br /><br />Despite all this, the show isn't nearly as good as it ought to be, and the fault of that lies in two definite tendencies. First, Season One is largely marred by an over reliance by an unfortunate gimmick: the almost weekly appearance of villains made so by their encounters with \\"meteor rocks\\" (i.e., kryptonite), always resulting in the acquisition of some ability that creates a tendency to perform evil deeds. The second is a general weakness in the writing on the show, especially touching the \\"freak of the week\\" stories. The writing on the season long story arc, on the other hand, is much, much stronger, and usually sustains the interest of the viewer over the relatively flat stories. The stand-alone plots are sometimes excruciatingly weak, coming across like bad imitations of some of the weaker X-FILES episodes. The X-FILES connection is, by the way, fairly strong, with many actors who appeared in that show also appearing in SMALLVILLE, perhaps because both shows were filmed in Vancouver (though THE X-FILES moved to L.A. after Season Five). For instance, Chloe's father is played by Robert Wisden, who guest starred in two exceptionally fine X-FILES episodes as \\"the pusher\\" Robert Patrick Modell, a man who can take over the will of other people. The first episode was directed by David Nutter, a veteran X-FILES director, and the original music on the show is provided by the great Mark Snow. A large number of key production people also have ties with THE X-FILES, including Matt Beck, in charge of visual effects for both shows. In Season Two we find Krista Allen, who guest starred in the notoriously awful \\"First Person Shooter\\" (widely considered one of the four or five worst X-FILES episodes), briefly becomes Lex Luthor's wife in Season Two, and the part of the mayor of Smallville is noneother than the Cigarette Smoking Man himself, William B. Davis. The connection between the two shows was made even more explicit inSeason Three, when Michael McKean (who made appearances on both shows) played Perry White, who at the time was working not for the Daily Planet but \\"The X-Styles.\\"<br /><br />I haven't seen Seasons Two through Four yet, but my hope is that the producers realized that the \\"freak of the week\\" storylines hampered the show as a whole, that the true interest in the series is the interrelations between Clark and Lex and Lana and Chloe and the rest. I kept having the sensation that there was a potentially great show trapped inside one that wasn't nearly as interesting.<br /><br />The show is a lot of fun for anyone familiar with the Superman story. Almost every episode features multiple jokes at the expense of the Superman legend, like an air force recruiting officer coming up to Clark and asking, \\"Don't you wish you could fly?\\" or Clark at an art museum looking at a breast plate that contains a figure that looks conspicuously like an \\"S\\" and insisting that he would never wear such an outfit.

It should have been better, and I have my hopes that the writing improved in subsequent seasons.cit in Season Three, when Michael McKean (who made appearances on both shows) played Perry White, who at the time was working not for the Daily Planet but \\"The X-Styles.\\"  <br /> <br />I haven't seen Seasons Two through Four yet, but my hope is that the producers realized that the \\"freak of the week\\" storylines hampered the show as a whole, that the true interest in the series is the interrelations between Clark and Lex and Lana and Chloe and the rest. I kept having the sensation that there was a potentially great show trapped inside one that wasn't nearly as interesting.  <br /> <br />The show is a lot of fun for anyone familiar with the Superman story. Almost every episode features multiple jokes at the expense of the Superman legend, like an air force recruiting officer coming up to Clark and asking, \\"Don't you wish you could fly?\\" or Clark at an art museum looking at a breast plate that contains a figure that looks conspicuously like an \\"S\\" and insisting that he would never wear such an outfit. Clark is almost always wearing some combination of blue, red, and yellow, the colors, of course, in the Superman uniform.  <br /> <br />All in all, this is a good show, much better, I will admit, than I was expecting. It should have been better, and I have my hopes that the writing improved in subsequent seasons.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|Frank Bullit is McQueen's performance masterpiece. It is here that his acting style comes to complete maturity and we see the man whose body language was so evocative become a true protagonist. Frank Bullit doesn't have to talk, he simply acts and in so doing, claims his place in our folklore. In a society that loves the individualist, the man of action unfettered by compromise and regulation, Frank Bullit is all of the these things. He seemingly answers to no one and gets the job done. He is \\"good copy\\" in the newspapers, making him \\"cop of choice\\" for aspiring local politicos like San Francisco D.A. Walter Chalmers, played so well by Robert Vaughan. He drives a Ford Mustang with a manual (not automatic!) transmission. He wears turtleneck sweaters under tweed coats with elbow patches, a detective with flair in a city whose style (especially then) was/is like no other. In other words, this man plays by his own rules. He runs his own investigations. He has Jacqueline Bisset for his live-in girlfriend! What more do you need?    But why is this McQueen at the top of his game? Because he oozes professionality, never hesitates, carries himself with a confidence never betraying that he is an actor portraying a detective. The role and the actor become one. There is never a touch of irony in his delivery of lines. He says very little and can communicate a wide range of feelings with his eyes or the trace of a smile. He never loses his temper but lets Walter Chalmers know the depth of his disdain. His loudest moment is behind the wheel of his sports car. All of this is delivered with an authenticity that is complete integrity. I wonder if McQueen took any direction at all while making this film. In The Great Escape or The Cincinnati Kid (both movies of superior quality) we see a McQueen who is confident and assured but somehow restrained, not in complete command of his surroundings. Not here. In Bullit McQueen owns every inch of the picture. Every scene is his and he knows it. No wonder he doesn't have to speak. I wonder if McQueen knew that speech is a traitor not an ally.    Five stars. You'll wish you were Frank Bullit/Steve McQueen.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Here's a recipe for a bad career move if you're Roman General Maximus:<br /><br />1)Start off your morning by opening up a can of old-fashioned Imperial Roman whup-a** on some barbarian hordes;<br /><br />2)Top off your understandably impressive win with a victory dance around the battlefield on your warhorse(accompanied by war-dogs, no less), culminating in a little tete-a-tete in the tent of the Big Enchilada himself, Emperor Marcus Aurelius (a dying man played, appropriately, by another dying man, Richard Harris);<br /><br />3) Get outmaneuvered by scheming daddy's boy and heir to the Empire Commodus (the mostly insufferably smarmy Joaquin Phoenix), who does a little downsizing: throttling the Emperor and demoting you from General of the Roman Legions to, ah, Dead Guy. You and your family too.<br /><br />So that's pretty much \\"Gladiator\\": equal parts saucy historical epic and revenge flick, \\"Kill Bill\\" with a toga and a gladius instead of shades and a katana.<br /><br />It's the sort of soaring, riveting, exotic concoction Hollywood was born to do: use classical history as grandpa's attic, ransack it, gussy it up, inject gobbets of gore and glory and a huge dose of trashiness into it, and in the end just dump the entire audience down the chute into the steaming, sandy vortex of a Roman gladiatorial pit. We who are about to die, Salute You!<br /><br />\\"Gladiator\\" is basically just 1964's epic \\"Fall of the Roman Empire\\" with a fresh coat of paint and some nifty CGI-tigers, and with all the eye-glazingly dull diplomatic blather cut out (because let's face it: who in their right mind goes to these things to watch old dudes in skirts babble on about how they'll take over Lutullus? Not *this* centurion!).<br /><br />Come to think of it, that flick featured the same characters (Marcus Aurelius, love-interest Lucilla, a wicked Commodus, even a disgraced general Livius) agonizing over the same conflict: Emperor kicks off, bad boy Commodus takes over, hero and villain go mano a mano in the arena at the end. Hmmm---maybe somebody should call their lawyers...<br /><br />At any rate, this version looks gorgeous, and is there anything---anything, I ask you?---that is as glorious as pumping up the volume on the big arena fight until you can rock the rafters of the house two counties over?<br /><br />Everything is quick, deadly, stylish, and tantalizingly rustic: all the high style (courtesy of Ridley Scott and cinematographer John Mathiesen, with a martial, exotic score mustered up by Hans Zimmer) cloaks the fact that \\"Gladiator\\" pretty much boils down to two brilliantly-staged fight scenes strung together by about 100 minutes of tedium.<br /><br />Russell Crow broods and glowers, and the flick is ninety shades of electric when he's at the center of it. Richard Harris does his patented \\"Old King in Winter\\" thing charmingly for his five minutes of screen time; Phoenix spins his sword and appears, mostly, painfully constipated; veteran character actor David Hemmings scarifies with his eyebrows; Oliver Reed works it as Proximo; Connie Nielsen (Lucilla, and yep, that was the Sophia Loren's name in \\"Fall of the Roman Empire\\"...hmmm) manages to be shockingly, mouth-wateringly beautiful in a scant role.<br /><br />But \\"Gladiator\\" isn't about that. It's about the spectacle at the dark, rotten heart of the Ancient World: about the Colosseum filled with the bellowing of ten thousand throats, filled to bursting with bloodlust and giddiness, about blood and sweat and steel and fear on the sand-covered surface of an arena of death two thousand years ago. In that regard, \\"Gladiator\\" succeeds wildly.<br /><br />Are you not entertained?<br /><br />JSGhero and villain go mano a mano in the arena at the end.

B0009I7NOO|5.0|If you are a fan of the this Supergroup buy this duel disc. Awesome! Great tunes and a great DVD. Turn Up the Sun, Guess God Thinks I'm Abel and Let There Be Love are the standout tracks. You'll love it so Buy IT!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This performance was simply the best.  I saw this on NBC with my wife and daughter.  I told them that I saw the Eagles in concert just after Joe Walsh joined them when Bernie Leadon left.  Randy Meisner was still on bass.  Don Felder was also with them.  The concert on TV brought back wonderful memories of that evening so long ago and many more as I relished the rich harmonies on those classic songs.  Glenn Frey did an excellent job on \\"Take it to the Limit\\" but it will alwys be Randy Meisner's song with those superb high notes Randy sang at the end.  I will own this DVD!
B00097A5I6|3.0|Rather than tear apart the latest effort by Oasis, I'd like to begin by pointing out several strong points on this album. <br /> <br />1. Lyla, the first single from this album, is a well-written, catchy song with some great vocals. <br />2. Let There Be Love is a beautiful song, and quite possibly one of Oasis's strongest ballads. Multiple listens and it gets even better. <br />3. Importance of Being Idle is a great song, and Noel does a great job on vocals. This tongue-in-cheek song about laziness is quite entertaining and a lot of fun to listen to. This track harkens back to some older Oasis... <br /> <br />Now for the weak points.  <br /> <br />1. The first thing that ran through my head after listening through the album once was, \\"Who the heck is playing drums?\\" One of the weakest points of the album is the repetative, often dull drum beats. Two songs in particular come to mind: Mucky Fingers and Meaning of Soul. I don't know if they were trying for a \\"heavier\\" sound, but it came across as rather... well... \\"garage\\" sounding. I had no idea that Ringo's son drummed on this album until I read some of these reviews, but I have to say, I'm not impressed so far. <br />2. Unfortunately, many of these songs lack good hooks/climaxes. They start, but never go anywhere. The best way I can describe it is thus: when you have this CD playing in the background, nothing is so good that it comes OUT of the background and grabs your attention. This album lacks some of the indescribable \\"magic\\" one comes to expect from Oasis. <br />3. Finally, I have to agree with what many reviewers have said: the mixing on this album was terrible. I have a great stereo system in my car which does a great job of playing well-balanced music... you can hear everything, even over the noise of the road. However, when playing this in my car, it lacked depth and clarity, and came across like a wash of noise.  <br /> <br />IN CLOSING: Is this album good? YES. Is it great? NO. However, it's worth a listen for the devoted Oasis fan. There are several songs on this album that take some getting used to, and require several listens before they begin to grow on you. \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" is definately an \\"acquired\\" taste, but give it a chance... there ARE shining moments on this record.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|All I can say is WOW. Just watched the broadcast of the show and it was all others have said and then some; amazement, laughter, tears, awe. <br /> <br />I have to agree with CW, it felt like they were holding back in some places, but hey, aren't we all slowing down a little? And like CW, I missed Felder - the new guy, Stueart Smith, while he has the chops, just isn't as tight with the rest of the group's phrasings. Hopefully by the time I see them in October that will have changed. <br /> <br />It was the first time I can recall hearing \\"Hole in the World,\\" and it is really a powerful song. Don Henley is a true poet as well as a great vocalist. <br /> <br />
B0007GADZO|5.0|Steve Vai has created a masterpiece with this album. I think, in my humble opinion, that this is his best album. \\"Passion and Warfare\\" or \\"Fire Garden\\" may have been fine at the times of their release, but this album trenscends anything he's done. All the compositions are well-thought out, well played, and very well recorded. There isn't a bad song on the album. Something that I can't say about \\"Passion...\\" or \\"Fire Garden.\\" I've read reviews that have said this album is \\"too far out there\\" or \\"too weird\\" and all I have to say is that's Steve Vai for you. That's the way all of his albums are. You're going to find a strangeness and he is going to play melodies that are far out there. That's just the way he's always played. That's the Frank Zappa side of him, which was one of his biggest influences. You can't hide your influences and Steve never has.<br /><br />Anyway, this album is really fantastic, not just on a highly technical level, but on an emotional level too. I've never heard metal-rock fusion played with such devotion and honesty. Fans of Steve Vai may be disappointed, others may praise this album, but the end result is an album that I'm glad I got a chance to listen to and talk about. \\"Real Illusions: Reflections\\" is bound to be a success, perhaps not commercially, but in terms of musical artistry, this is a highly ambitious and creative album that'll make you laugh, cry, and hopefully inspire you to do great things.
0316172324|3.0|This book is full of many little stories that augment the author's point that many judgements are made as split second decisions.  When I first started it, I was hoping that it would have more of a scientific understanding of how any why this works.  After reading it, it seems as though all I've seen is a large collection of examples that support the point that decisions and judgements are made quickly, and that with practice this can be somewhat controlled. <br /> <br />Overall, I don't think that it was a bad book; It just feels like there are a lot of examples that work to lead you to your own conclusions.  To borrow a theme from the book, \\"something just didn't seem that exciting about it, but it is difficult to put it into words.\\"

1591396190|5.0|I was anxiously waiting for this book to be published. Why? Together with my collegues we have run first workshops in Value Innovation in Poland in 2004. VI constitutes cornerstone of Blue Ocean Strategy and I could see it work in real life business context. No wonder I wanted to gain some more inspiration of how it worked elswhere. Authors were also very good at selecting business cases they present. The book is a great read because it has three qualities indispensable to business publication: <br /> <br />Firstly it inspires. Many examples create an intriguing story how you can turn around your business. The book has not-only-American examples appealing to readers both in Europe and Asia. For readers in Central Europe definitely example of NABI comes as most interesting. <br /> <br />Secondly it is up to date. It goes without saying that the profitable business growth became burning business issue for all management boards across the world. <br /> <br />Finally the methodology is research based, coherent and when applied delivers results surpassing traditional strategy formulation. It is simple but not simplistic, and authors maintain tricky equilibrium between simplicity of use and in-depth approach.  <br /> <br />I was also surprised that this book was real page turner even though I read it in English which is not my native language (as you can see anyways:-). <br /> <br />The Blue ocean strategy\\" by W. Chan Kim and Rene Mauborgne really gives a refreshing view on the modern business. No fancy wordings, no colorful pictures, no buzz words that do not mean much just simplicity at its best - the future of business will boil down to smart strategic moves. <br />  <br />After workshops in Poland where we actually applied Value Innovation I can say the method is a beauty, though requires quite an intellectual effort. Especially to overcome the we-want-to-be-the-best-anywhere-possible attitude.  <br /> <br />I wish more companie dare follow the Blue ocean path, it is not easy but surprisingly rewarding over short span of time. <br /> <br />Lukasz Dabrowski <br />consultant with House of Skills company in Warsaw, Poland. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000003N8R|5.0|Crescent is a masterpiece. plain and simple. The playing of the Coltrane Classic Quartet during this period that included this recording and A LOVE SUPREME is some of the best jazz ever recorded. The selections on Crescent are stunningly beautiful and Coltrane's sound is fully developed and distinctive. These were recorded in '64 just before Coltrane embraced the free-jazz movement. The music here is haunting, experimental and yet rooted in a lyrical sense that is not true of some of his later more experimental work. If I had to recommend one Coltrane CD to a curious friend who was unfamiliar with his work this would be the one. It's more challenging than the wall of sound -Giant Steps era stuff but still highly accessable to even a jazz novice. Yet this is no simple music. It is really one of the few CDs I couldn't live without.
0375405380|2.0|Don Winslow seems to write in two completely different voices, voices so different that it is hard to believe these books are by the same person.  If you liked \\"California Fire and Life,\\" you will be very disappointed in \\"Power of the Dog.\\" If you liked \\"The Death and Life of Bobby Z,\\" then you may enjoy \\"The Dog.\\"    Unfortunately, the voice I liked was the original, snappy one that gave \\"California Fire and Life\\" one of the sparkiest openings I've ever read. \\"Bobby Z\\" seemed standard and disappointing-albeit busy and bloody-and I didn't finish it. \\"Power of the Dog\\" covers twenty-five years of battling Mexican drug cartels, including the death-by-torture of DEA agent Enrique Camarena in the 1980s. Ambitious, but ultimately pretty standard. If you want a really, really scary look at the Mexican cartels, read Arturo Perez-Reverte's \\"Queen of the South.\\"
B000055Y0X|3.0|I am sorry, but unlike a great deal of the reviewers, I do not believe this is the greatest comedy every made and certainly not the best film ever made.  Not even close.  I'll admit, the film was amusing at times, but I think it's overrated at best.  I like satires, but this just didn't catch my interest.  Sometimes I had no idea what was going on during this film.  I kept looking at the clock on the wall, desperately hoping it would end.  I REALLY wanted to like this movie.  When I saw it at the video rental store, I was really excited, because I kept meaning to watch it and I thought I was going to love it.  But I really didn't.  I wouldn't watch it again.  However, if it was just rated on acting, I would give it five stars because the actors were phenomenal in their parts.  Peter Sellers did a superb job. <br /> <br />This movie is just not what I thought it would be.  It just struck me as bizarre, confusing, and only slightly funny.  I enjoyed the scenes of the hotline and the fluoridation discussion. <br /> <br />To the reviewer who compared this film to \\"Gone with the Wind\\" I can only say that you're insane.  \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is a touching, if not a bit biased, portrayal of life in the old south, filled with wonderful music, beautiful scenery, outstanding acting, and a heart-wrenching plot.  \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" was amusing at times, but never even came CLOSE to \\"Gone With the Wind\\".  There is a reason that \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is #4 on the AFI's Greatest Movies of All-Time while \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" is #26.  I personally don't believe it deserves even that ranking.   <br /> <br />This movie wasn't bad, but I didn't really think it was good either.  Honestly, I wouldn't watch it again.  It just wasn't worth the 93 minutes of my life.  Basically, this is somewhat of a cult-classic.  Some people will love it, some won't.  It takes a certain sense of humor to enjoy it.  My father enjoyed it tremendously.  Just don't think it's a rip-roaring comedy when it really isnot.  It's an eccentric kind of humor that not all will enjoy.  Fluoridation or not.
B0001L3MI0|1.0|This is on my top 10 list \\"All time worst movies\\"!  I can't understand how anyone can compare this movie to Star Wars.  Star Wars took some imagination.  George Lucas paid attention to details and he cared about his story.  You get none of that with Independence Day.  There is no attention to detail, logic, facts or reality in this film.  I could go on all day with the problems with this film.  The casting, acting, story are horrible.  What was the point of making a \\"Sci-Fi\\" movie ultra-politically correct?  Does anybody actually care that tokens for each \\"minority\\" group are represented in this film?  After the first 20 minutes only morbid curiosity kept me watching.  When I saw the surface of the moon vibrating from the approaching alien ship, I knew I was in trouble.  I guess the genius writers couldn't figure out that vibrations don't travel through space.  I guess I shouldn't be too hard on them, since they were probably still in elementary school when they wrote the script for it.  I kept wondering how much worse can it get.  If I had seen this in a theatre, I would have walked out.
0441172717|3.0|It took me nearly a week to read the first hundred and fifty pages.  Perhaps it was not the story itself that made me stop every   twenty pages  or so, but the characters.  Character development could be much better executed.  Overall each character repeats a saying about ten  times through each book  or takes the same actions over and over again.  Herbert was most definitely a pioneer in the genre of sci-fi, but since his time there have been many novels of greater quality.  <br />  <br />    The story becomes very emmersive after the overthrow of the Atreides.  Paul coming of age and becoming Muad'dib is very entertaining and it is impossible but to hope that he wins every battle and becomes the most powerful person in the galaxy.  <br /> <br />    Ive seen reviewers complain about the ending.  I thought this was the best part of the novel and I'll tell you why.  It was the   first real part of the novel involving political intrigue.  In the beginning of the  novel we all knew the Atreides were doomed...the Reverend Mother told us so in the first few chapters.  At the final battle we knew that the Fremen  would win. People not familiar with Dune would think that Paul would  marry Chani.  However, instead he marries the Emperor's daughter  in order to secure a tie to the throne and future dominance of the Atreides line.   <br /> <br />     In the movie(6 hour version)the storyline holds quite true to the book.  However; instead of dragging you through five or six hours reading the boring setup of the plot, it provides you with the exact same information in an hour and a half.  It even includes more detail, such as tone of voice and facial expressions that make the whole experience seem more real.   <br /> <br />     This book  will remain a classic for die-hard genre fans and is worth the read for anyone who enjoys action-adventure stories.     As for myself, I enjoyed the book but feel that there are better books out there to take the time to read.
B00005JMAH|4.0|The Prisoner of Azkaban is the continuing story of Harry Potter and his friends at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardy.  The films recreate the books by J.K. Rowling.  In this film, Harry is being pursued by murderous Sirius Black, who has escaped from Azkaban, the terrifying prison for wizards.  He is also having premonitions of a legendary black dog called \\"the Grim,\\" which brings death to all who see it.  Hogwart's is being guarded by menacing creatures called Dementors, black spectres who are prison guards at Azkaban.<br /><br />This film has a new director, Spanish director Alonzo Cuaron, who took over from Chris Columbus.  Columbus remains involved in the Potter movies as a producer.  Cuaron's style is very different from Columbus.  For example, the trio of Ron, Hermione, and Harry are rarely seen in their Hogwart's uniforms, but mostly in street clothes.  Personally, I preferred Columbus' directing.  The film also has a new Albus Dumbledore, after the passing of Richard Harris.  The new Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, does an excellent job and is virtually indestinguishable from Harris' Dumbledore, which adds seamless continuity.<br /><br />A new teacher for the Defense of the Dark Arts is one of the best characters in this movie and indeed in the series.  Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) is a kindly father figure to Harry, helping Harry overcome his paralyzing fear of the Dementors.  But Lupin has a terrible secret.<br /><br />There is a werewolf in this movie.  I must say I think this werewolf is the most authentic ones ever depicted on screen.  A werewolf is a wretched creature doomed to a life of violence and painful transformations.  Unlike the werewolf with the twelve-pack and glorious mane in Van Helsing, the werewolf in \\"Prisoner\\" is truly terrifying.<br /><br />The second DVD is packed with extras that take almost as long as the movie to enjoy.

B0007Y4TVU|2.0|Not mezmerized at all with this album. Besides the standout single, BYOB, and a few other tracks, namely, Cigaro, Radio/Video, Question & Sad Statue, the rest of the songs are throw-aways. That's 5/11 tracks, people, not even half the album is worth the price of admission!!  <br />It makes me sick to listen to what people have to say about this very bland album and I can't believe that people are actually dishing out between $12-$15 to buy this thing when it's only 32 minutes long. This album is ZERO compared to Toxicity and old System songs which have stood the true test of time. Don't waste your time buying this album for a few songs just to make SOAD richer than they already are!!
B0009I7NOO|1.0|Bought the dualdisc version and while the album is really great, actually the best Oasis album since 'Morning Glory', this version won't work with MP3 players, since it won't load on the computer. Only the DVD side, which won't allow you to transfer the tracks to your player.
0671027387|5.0|This is the first novel of Dan Brown that I've read, and I consider it to be an excellent read. It's generally fast-paced, has some nice suprises, and raises interesting political issues. I heartily recommend it.
B00005JMEW|1.0|This film proves to me the metal attitude of americans.  If anyone thinks that this is a good film you must not have a very high moral standing.  We are becoming an ever more and more violent country and these films really help that cause.  This film should not be viewed by anyone who is mentally disturbed.  It will just add another nail in someones coffin.  Tarantino should be ashamed to make films like this.
B00082IJ08|4.0|This is an unapolagetically militant endorsement of the man behind the Gorillaz project, Damon Albarn. Justified because one can only understand the baffling beauty of Demon Days through a closer look at this hidden genius. Of course this is the work of more than one - DJ Danjermouse taking Dan the Automators place from the first album - but Albarn has always picked his collaborators well. See the excellent Mali Music where he gives local African musicians a beautiful warm space to delight us. Blur, his main band, was often credited to guitarist Graham Coxon. However Coxon left the band before their last album and Think Tank was, frankly, the better for it. Listening to Coxon's retro solo efforts one realises Albarn was the one responsible for the restless innovation and melodic instinct behind the band. Similarly he was the real architect of Mali Music's charm. Blur, Gorillaz and Mali music are utterly different but all have his distinctive stamp - lo-fi, lolloping, nihilistic, beautiful and utterly new. A chameleon of pop over the past 15 years but, unlike Bowie, one whose personality doesn't take centre stage, only his musical quest. It is because of this that he has been largely un-noticed. This modesty is perfectly exemplified in Gorillaz where he hides behind invented cartoon characters. Enough on his history, what about Demon Days? <br />A good album, addictive - i found myself listening it back to back three times, furious there wasn't more of it. Smothered in production it ought to fail as style over substance usually does but Albarn's genius for melody lifts triumph from the trap of cool. Underneath there hides the archetypical verse-chorus verse structure. <br />But how well he treats it. Take Kids with Guns - the bassline doesn't change throughout but each verse sounds totally new, approached from a different angle or instrument. And the choruses, as ever, shine. Lyrically and melodically his trick is to create a lost, sad, cool verse then break into themost beautiful, lazy and plaintive vocal for the chorus. Take Feel good inc with its featherweight bass breaking down in the echoing chorus. The lyrics make less sense than George Bush on acid - singing about 'windmills hand in hand' - but he deliberately abandoned his trademark narrative songs after the fourth Blur album, about the time he abandoned the guitar quartet stereotype. Cut loose he manages to evoke a familiar modern nihilism and abandonment of any conviction. 13, the Blur album recorded just after his breakup with Elastica singer Justine Frischman, should be listened to as the pinnacle of this senseless sense. Every song echoes with shattered love while he rambles  <br />'Shooting stars in my left arm <br />It's an alcohol low <br />Giving away time to Casio <br />The sun is slow <br />and I've got soul. <br />Is this where I'm going to <br />we'll see, we see, we see'. <br />Songs like 'Every planet we reach is dead' and 'Don't get lost in Heaven' lead you through similar lost sadnesses, dragged like a monkey in a space suit.  <br />This album might make you cry or dance or quietly think afresh. Buy it but, as you've probably guessed, buy any stuff this man produces. Albarn is the single living musical genius of my collection and I am grateful for every new thing he does. Hopefully you will find the same.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|The guys are getting a bit older, but they still got the Funkin energy! The show at Slane Castle catches the band on a night that they really are in a groove. The sound is tight and it is just enjoyable to watch. The list of tracks covers a lot of the band's hits although the focus is on the last two discs. Breaking the Girl and Soul To Squeeze are among the few missing hits. Its really nice to see John Frusciante really come into his own as a great guiter player. The current lineup of the band may be it's best ever and this is a DVD that every fan should own.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Rammstein is renouned for their controversial music but Reise, Reise takes the cake. The best tracks (I believe) are:Moskau, Amerika, Mein Teil, and Reise, Reise. Moskau is great with Victoria Fersh in the back ground. Did you Know that Rammstein originally wanted t.A.T.u. to do it? Any ways buy it its worth every penny!
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|Very short, whiney, gay-rock at its worst! Lyrics are a bunch of meaningless crap, NOTHING compared to older thought-provoking material of theirs. Two thums down! Can't believe people are recommending this album- there's something wrong with y'all! System could have done much better than this after 3 years!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie rocked!!!! I had heared that it was a funny movie and it was. I was laughing through the whole thing practically. But its not for everyone, as you can tell. It has no plot;you just basically come in on Nepoleans day of school and you kinda gotta go from there. Different events happen in the movie, such as the dance and the presidential election that are all kinda separate. But its still probably one of the funniest movies EVER. You just gotta watch it with an open mind.
B000002JPA|5.0|When Dream Theater's 1992 album/cd Images And Words came out, it set the standard for any and all heavy-progressive-technical music that followed. Any band that released a similar style cd would almost always get the \\"..just like Dream theater..\\" or \\"..just like Images And Words..\\" comparison. Dont take my word for it, browse thru the massive catalog here at Amazon for similar groups and read the reviews. Or get a back issue of any guitar magazine with a \\"100 greatest guitar albums of all time\\" list (or some such) and Dream Theater's Images And Words will be on it. Gauranteed. <br /> <br /> In short, this album defines the genre, making it an all-time rock classic, on par with say, Led Zeppelin II, Metallica's Master Of Puppets, AC/DC's Back In Black, Rush's Moving Pictures, Yes' Fragile..... you get the picture. All-time classic= 5 stars <br /> <br /> If you are new to Dream Theater, Images And Words is the 1st one you should purchase.
B000001FG5|4.0|SPIRITS HAVING FLOWN IS A GOOD ALBUM BUT THERE IS TOO MUCH FALSETTO ON IT BARRY SCREAMS TOO MUCH ON IT MY FAVORITE SONGS ON THERE ARE TRAGEDY TOO MUCH HEAVEN I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THE OTHER SONGS ON THERE!<br /><br />FROM A BIG BEE GEES FAN FOR 15 YEARS NOW KIRSTEN
B00008PX8P|3.0|Yes, many of the performances on this DVD set are simply phenomenal. Yes the sound, even for the older performances, is outstanding. But why did Jimmy Page find it necessary to muck up the footage with cheesy \\"effects\\" that do nothing but detract from the performances and irritate the viewer?  <br /> <br />The jumpy quick cuts that have been added in the production of this DVD are I suppose an attempt to make the footage more up to date, or-dare I say it-\\"hip\\". But even jump cuts are now about 10 years out of date, mainly because they distract from the performances and irritate the viewer (imagine that). The only performers who insist on using this techniques are dinosaurs like Paul McCartney and, unfortunately, Led Zeppelin in this DVD. <br /> <br />I can only hope it was Jimmy Page who visited this mutilation on the original Zep footage. If it was some technical hack trying to make his mark I can only say-butt out! The performances stand on their own as rock masterpieces. We Zep fans don't need your \\"genius\\" screwing things up. For crying out loud I thought everyone learned that after Ted Turner's attempts to \\"update\\" classic films by defacing them with colorization.
0553573403|5.0|Before reading \\"A Game of Thrones\\" I no idea of what I was in for. The book begins with a few confusing chapters concerning some things that have no real importance until you get further into the series.<br /><br />Once you get about 100 pages into the book you will find yourself hooked to certain characters and yern to read more about them. Don't be surprised to find that what you expect to happen DOESN'T happen. Martin does a great job of keeping the plot a secret and to some that may be annoying, I find it enhances my experience. Thats what this series really is, an experience. By reading the chapters focused on a few characters from all sides of the story you will see how they work and why they do the things they do.<br /><br />I would like to warn you about the end. A lot of loveable characters die. Have no fear, it helps thicken the plot throughout the next 6 books in the series.<br /><br />When all is said and done, this series will be close to 8,000 pages. It's well worth it. The characters are deeply developed and you will share their emotions, good or bad.
B000002BPS|4.0|This album is good album to follow Smash. I'll agree with people who say that their sound changed with Americana, then Conspiracy and Splinter. I like Americana thru Splinter, but I love the sound of Offspring, Ignition, Smash, and Ixnay better. Although I dont think this was better than Smash, it's still a kick*ss album!
B00008EY9G|4.0|Cool, Awesome, Engrossing...I guess that there is much to say about this movie!!  Again, I did not expect much from this film, but I found totally the opposite in return!!  A great story..weird, but it was GREAT!!! :) Action, murder, lots of murder!!!  GREAT!!!  :) Do not miss this one!!! :):):):):):):):):) <br />Christopher Berry
B000096I9G|5.0|I live in a rather crap town 8 hours from Winnipeg. And a lot of bands either only hit Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver and nothing else or they do hit Winnipeg. 8 hours to see one damn band for less than 2 hours! So that's where concert DVD's come in handy. On this, you get 3 albums performed in their entirety but therein may lay a problem. <br /> <br />The Pornography set to be quite honest didn't really catch my full attention. Either it's because the songs hadn't quite caught on with me yet or it's just not good. So either it's a set/record that you have to re-listen to to \\"get it\\" or it just plain sucks no matter how many times, beats me. Next up is the Disintegration and probably my favorite set since it contains stuff like Pieces of You, Closedown, Fascination Street and Love Song. <br /> <br />The Bloodflowers set is just mildly ok, there's a couple good songs like opener Out of This World but as a whole it's like Pornography, may require repeated listens/watches. Disappointly the encores are just weak in terms of quantity: you get If Only Tonight I Could Sleep and The Kiss, 2 admittedly great cuts from Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me but where's Letter to Elise? Just Like Heaven? Killing an Arab? Forest? Hell I'd even take the cutesy-but-catchy-as-hell Friday I'm in Love.  <br /> <br />As for the sound/picture quality, it's nice and sharp and the instruments ring clear although sometimes if you have Robert playing an instrument(which is kinda often), one instrument might get drowned out. Also Robert's vocals are a little off sometimes. It's kinda depressing in a way to not hear his clear perfect \\"if only I thought of the right words\\" bridge from Pictures of You here but oh well. <br /> <br />The bonus features are nice if maybe a tad short but they're just bonus to having 3 whole albums performed live with great sound. Now bring on a traditional live release and perform in Winnipeg for once damnit
0375713751|4.0|This is a lighthearted novel, not a platform for expressing feminist issues.  I thoroughly enjoyed the tale, and each day found myself looking forward to reading a bit more about the characters. The daughter is especially cute and tends to bring about the \\"awww\\" moments.  Take this with you to the beach, or read it when you feel like things are over your head.
0486408434|5.0|This is without a doubt the best introduction on card magic on planet earth. Period. The only one that might rank close is the Card College by swiss card conjurer Roberto Giobbi, which is however somewhat a dry read. And much too expensive since he takes the material of \\"A royal road to Card magic\\" and \\"Expert Card Techniques\\" and turns it into five volumes which are selling at 35 bucks each (I am not accusing him of a rehash but he also didnt re-invent card magic) . These ones have been written in the fourties...and have an incredible charm to them. I wouldnt even call the writing dated, I am from Germany and my English is pretty good, but not perfect, but I find it extremely easy to follow the instructions.  <br /> <br />What I love about the book. I have been interested in card magic since I was a boy and have only recently picked up this  hobby  again, and even though I am probably already familiar with every slight dealt with in this book, it kind of fills in the gaps. For example, even though I know of course how to control a card using a simple overhand shuffle, I was never really able - or even aware of - a false overhand shuffle. I mean a shuffle that looks genuine (not just \\"running\\" the cards one by one) and 100 percent deceptive. I am kind of an indermediate, you see. And then this book made me think: well, maybe not even just yet. <br /> <br />Didactically the book is brilliant. For starters, it does not torture you with slights only, but every chapter will already introduce three or four tricks that go with the slight in question, and Hugard and Braue have made sure that they are worth -while. I have found some real gems here. Which really surprised me. I mean, the more one deals with the subject, the more one tends to me focusing on real crazy stuff, like card so saltshaker, tear and restore a card....routines like that, which make you forget there are \\"normal\\" tricks out there. DVDs on the subject are floading the market and there is some great stuff. Here, however, a solid foundation is laid, that you will benefit from for the rest of your life. I could write on forever. I think this is just IT. Some teaching DVDs are great, but NONE offer the array of slights and the encouraging style and tone of this book (Except maybe for \\"Daryls Encyclopedia of Card slights\\", which will however confuse the beginner). \\"Some of the finest tricks\\", as they say, will be at your fingertips soon. They keep it as simple as possible. One more thing, there are no knuckle busters here. Just the basics. But ALL of them. <br /> <br />1. The Overhand Shuffle <br />2. The Riffle Shuffle <br />3. Flourishes <br />4. The Glide <br />5. The Glimpse <br />6. The key card <br />7. The palm <br />8. The back slip <br />9. Overhand Shuffle Part Two <br />10. False Shuffles and Cuts <br />11. Double Lift and Turnover <br />12. The Pass <br />13. Miscalleneous Flourishes <br />14. The Reverses <br />15. Hindu Shuffles and other Controls <br />16. The classic Force <br />17. Top and bottom changes <br />18. Arrangements <br />19. Routines <br />20. Platform Tricks <br /> <br />Again, the introduce the slights in an order that makes sense and in each chapter there are already tricks that go with the slight. You will be performing magic within...well, day one, lets say. Buy this if you love card magic and wish to go beyond the proverbial Uncle Charlie Card trick (\\"in which row is your card\\"), for this is superbe.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Wow!  I have bought every System of a Down CD to date, and have always really liked about 25 to 50 percent of each and didn't really care for the rest.  This CD is totally different!  After one listen-through I fell in love.  I was totally skeptical when I bought it (primarily because I loved their 1st single B.Y.O.B.) that it would be more of the same.  Three or four \\"good\\" songs and rest being just plain weird.  Not here. <br /> <br />Every song is good - catchy, tight, and well-produced - yet still VERY System of a Down.  If you like the B.Y.O.B. single, you'll love this CD - ironically to me, BYOB is one of the weirder songs...  Just goes to show what a great producer can do with a great band!  Only issue is it is only 38 minutes long, but I'd rather have 38 quality minutes than 70 minutes with only 20 that I actually like!  I totally recommend this CD and can't wait for the 2nd part later this year!
B0009I7NOO|4.0|After slipping into near-obscurity with their lamentable \\"Heathen Chemistry\\", it's good to have Oasis back on the much-improved \\"Don't Believe the Truth.\\" <br /> <br />Is it as good as their earlier, triumphant works such as \\"Definitely Maybe\\", \\"Be Here Now\\", or even \\"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants\\" ? No.   <br /> <br />But, unlike some of their works, it is *consistent*. <br /> <br />The album, as I've listened to it, has neither highs nor lows, rather it is chock-filled with above average songs from the opening, enjoyable \\"Turn Up the Sun\\" to the closing (not-quite eternally memorable, standard Oasis ballad) \\"Let there be Love.\\" <br /> <br />Will this CD be dulled by consistent play, as was \\"Definitely Maybe\\"  ?  NO, I don't think so.  But it will be listened to, and not immediately be relegated to the dust-bin (as was \\"Heathen Chemistry\\").    <br /> <br />Bottom line:  Oasis fans, gobble it up.  It's worth a listen.  It will, at the least, rekindle your love of their best works.  And that's more than most bands can claim.
1932907009|5.0|Blake Snyder's SAVE THE CAT! Could also be called SAVE THE SCREENWRITER!, because that's exactly what it will do: Save the screenwriter time, save the screenwriter frustration, and save the screenwriter's sanity. Blake takes you behind-the-scenes and into the decision-makers' offices as he explains how the Hollywood system works and what writers should expect as they journey through the perilous maze of Hollywood.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|There is something for everyone here.  This is one of the best family drama series to hit TV for a long time.  I am so glad to know that it can be purchased on DVD for those who have missed out on this quality drama.  I intend to give it for gifts.<br /><br />Another plus is that you don't have to send your kids out of the room to watch it.  There is no bad language, or risque scenes, but normal every day topics such as sex and teen pregnancies are handled in good taste, and bring up points to discuss with your own family after the show.<br /><br />The acting is top rate - all the characters in this fictional town are believable and likeable.  Can't wait to see what next season brings, and we hope the WB continues with it.  \\"Everwood\\" makes you want to live there!
B000092ZYX|4.0|I like this album, but I do begrudge is lack of momentum.  Its a very good album if you're already in the mood of it, but when I just want to listen to music for the sake of music, rather than mood, this is not the album.  However, if you are in the dreary, hopeless mood and just want to soak it up, its great, and comes with plenty of neat sounds and ideas as well, even if I don't feel they're integrated in the most careful or refined manner.  Personally, I think I prefer Amnesiac for dreary though, and find that album, potentially because of its thinner textures, more regularly listenable.
B0009KA7BS|2.0|I thought the movie was ok and had some cool moments.  I didn't like the deamons/devils; they looked terrible.  They needed a better artist or vision/concept.  The movie had so much potential.  Hollywood has not produced a good Heaven/Hell, Angel/Devil movie.  Hopefully something of worth will be produced in the near future.
B0008G2IRO|5.0|hey this cd is something you should get right now while it's in stock cause finding it is a pain in the ass!!! this cd sold out fast from where i am so just getting it would be a god send plus the extras are great to get it at this price is a good idea right now it will go up later on in the year plus go to independent record stores for the copy and order if not there plus put a pay down on it so you won't pay full price later on
B00006RCSU|2.0|What appears to be the setting of L.A. might be the worse place to do a remake of Romeo and Juliet. I like Leonardo Decaprio, he was not so good in this. Since when did people start talking like Romeo and Juliet in L.A.? THE STORY IS SET IN VERONA, ITALY. It is COMPLETELY different compared to the original. There are fireworks, a pool, electricity, guys dressing up like homos, and a whole bunch of crap that has absolutely NOTHING to do whatsoever with what should be associated with the  deserved setting of movie. In the story, there is a prince and in the movie, HE'S A COP!! The producers just probably wanted to screw everything about Romeo and Juliet and add this century to the story's. Everyone has cars, they carry guns instead of swords, the characters aren't very recognizable, and more isn't needed in this bad remake of what might be a classic in Shakespeare's stuff. Who knew stories like this could have such bad remakes of their adaptions?? It also seemed like a documentary.....    BOTTOM LINE:      Leo's cool, this movie really isn't.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|The movie should be seperated into 2 parts, the actual movie and the historical car chase scene.  This movie (with the exception of James Bond) redefined what a car chase scene should be all about.  The fastback Mustang it worth watching the movie for, but when you sit down and watch it you also have to gasp at how good the story and the performance of the actors.  Would recommend this movie for anyone and a must for any DVD collection.  Long live the Mustang.
B000031EGV|3.0|Jumanji isn't bad as far as board game movie adaptations go. Not quite as transcendent as Clue but much better than the overwrought Scrabble: The Movie. Director Joe Johnston (The Rocketeer) does a nice job intertwining the non-stop action of, say, Hungry Hungry Hippos or Candyland, with the riveting suspense of Uno, humor of Pictionary, and the tales of love and betrayel of Sorry. Now, if only they'd adapt Guess Who, my world would be complete. Three billion thumbs up.
0306812835|2.0|I'M PROBABLY THE ODD MAN OUT ON THIS ONE BUT I HAD TROUBLE WADING THROUGH THIS BOOK..IN FACT I THOUGHT THE WRITING STYLE WAS GROPING AND STUMBLING AT BEST. WRITING ABOUT STRUCTURES IN SIMLPE TERMS IS A TOUGH TASK INDEED AND I'M NOT SURE GORDON HAS SUCEEDED HERE. I FOUND THE BOOK TO BE A REAL \\"YAWNER\\".<br /><br />FOR MY MONEY I WOULD BUY SALVADORI'S BOOKS OVER THIS. SALVADORI HAS A KNACK FOR MAKING THE SUBJECT TRULY GRIPPING READING.  HIS BOOKS HAVE A MUCH MORE PRACTICAL BENT, AND IMHO THEY ARE WRITTEN MUCH BETTER, NOT TO MENTION THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE TOP GRADE. TRY STRUCTURE IN ARCHITECTURE OR WHY BUILDINGS STAND UP.<br /><br />THE 2 STARS ARE FOR GORDON'S DISCUSSION OF STRESS AND STRAIN, THE BEST PART OF THE BOOK FOR ME.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Its not Toxicity but ok.  I dont get Daron singing all the time though.  Hes not a good singer.  He sounds like a whiney bitch!
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer: An album that seems to either earn five stars or one star when reviewed by the laiety. So which is it?<br /><br />Q: Is OK Computer a deep, complex, ponderous, subtle, unintelligible-yet-prophetic tour-de-force, or is it simplistic, obvious, straightforward, vanilla-flavored, a recycling bin full of yesterday's newspapers and 24-pack beer boxes?<br /><br />A: Both, as is so often the case. There is a kind of genius (always has been) in being able to state what should have been obvious to everyone all along, but was only obvious to those who didn't ever think to mention it because it was so obvious to them. Think William Carlos Williams:<br /><br />\\"so much depends<br />upon<br /><br />a red wheel<br />barrow<br /><br />glazed with rain<br />water<br /><br />beside the white<br />chickens\\"<br /><br />OK Computer is precisely the same color:<br /><br />\\"God loves his children, yeah.\\"<br /><br />The undeniably deadpan-yet-sardonic line is an encapsulation of the work. It's cynical and would be adolescently so if only for the fact that you never first thought to say it yourself. It's dark but but in its indignation is also as hopeful as anything else yet said. It's banal, but perish the thought that nobody should be inclined to continue to re-visit it. It's simplistic to a fault, unless you don't understand it, in which case the text required to explain it in every nuance is voluminous indeed.<br /><br />Five stars. Even if you think it's obvious and simple, you can't deny that it's right or believably suggest that it's not sincere. And for that reason, those who give it only one star are not themselves reviewing in good faith.
B0007TKNL0|1.0|I have seen the play in New York and the movies is just as perfect and even more than the play the voices are awesome but the subtitles in spanish are INSULTS not only for me that thank God I'm billingual, but for Mr Andrew Lloyd. <br />The subtitles are poetic, sound good but are not related at all with the play in english, i know a piece like this is hard to turn into spanish making it sound as beautiful as in the original language but that is something that  MUST be respect. <br />The person who translated the play should write his own musical in spanish call Triangle or something but NEVER The Phantom of the Opera. <br />I would sell it! It might sound crazy but I am not letting the play take a new idea!!! <br />SHAME ON YOU MR TRANSLATOR, and in the company for allowing that Crime
B0009NSE1K|5.0|These guys are probably the most underrated band around.  This album is a little heavier than the last few but at the same time also more technical.  The keyboards are very prominent now, and I think they bring that extra element to the sound.  I highly recommend this album. <br /> <br />One of the great things about Clutch is that they work harder than any other band I can thnk of.  They seem to put out a new album every 18 months or so despite the fact that they are touring like 250 days a year.  And they are all quality albums.
B0009AM5JA|5.0|Absolutely amazing. Coldplay has made an amazing cd which mixes it's beautiful acoustic sound of Parachutes, and there paino smashing hits off a Rush of Blood to the Head to make one amazing cd. It's some what more \\"rockish\\" then the previous two albums, but still stays true to Coldplay's amazing song writing formula. Even if you aren't a Coldplay fan, you need to check this cd out. It will definatly be one of this years best.<br />Some of the highlights of this album are: What If, Fix You, Talk, X & Y, Swallowed by the Sea, and Twisted Logic.
B000002UAX|3.0|They really really really were losing there craft by the time they came out with this self-indulgent excuse for a album.<br /><br />This should have been a single album rather then a double album, Want a good Beatles album. Pick up Rubber Soul or Magical Mystery Tour.  I think the Digimon movie soundtrack is better. Becuse digimon is cool
B00097DX3U|3.0|To all Audioslave fans: 'Out of Exile,'is a decent cd, I just expected better from this band.  On their debut album, every song seemed to be a hit, this new cd does not deliver as well.  I love Audioslave, they have an original sound and all, but they just didn't deliver with this sophomore album.  When I heard their first album, I was like, \\"Wow, this is an awesome cd.\\"  When I heard this cd i just shrugged my shoulders.  It's decent at best.  'Be Yourself' is the best song on this cd and it is already overplayed on the radio. If you are thinking of buying this cd, I would advise you to find someone to burn it for you. <br /> <br />-Airman First Class Bobby Bunch <br /> 379th ESFS
B000002UB3|5.0|Reading some of the revues for this album make me think just how many people are there out there that have never heard the beatles ???? the first time I heard that I remember hearing the beatles I was in short pants at the tender age of 5 and was instantly hooked and have been ever since and yes this was their finest hour albeit there last hour. god what a band they where and how sorely I miss them they laid the foundations for all the rock bands to come and I still judge all others against them long live the beatles they last and last thank god for the memories I have of listening to their music as it came out. I feel so fortunate to have been there when it occured.
B0000CFW87|1.0|Someone played me this cd in their car. For openers, I was not enthralled with the voice quality. Secondly, the very syrupy, sicky-sweet style throughout the cd is constant and can truly get on one's nerves after a few minutes. Yes, some of the tracks are written in foreign tongues. However, the music is always annoying, regardless of whether it is in English, French, Italian, Malaysian, or Swahili. I dislike Josh Groban's music. Perhaps that means I'm not a sensitive person. Oh, well.
B000021YQV|5.0|It may have taken them 4 years, but System of a Down have returned with a very worthy follow up. \\"Toxicity\\" is much more mature and heavier than their debut. Some songs (i.e. \\"Prison Song\\") have bobbing riffs, some songs (i.e. \\"Deer Dance\\") have machine gun riffs, other songs (i.e. \\"Jet Pilot\\") have guitar work that is very fast throughout, there are still more songs (i.e. \\"Chop Suey\\") that begin slowly and build to a faster pace. But this isn't a complete guitar maelstrom. The drums (which often hit simultaneously with the guitars) are also very good (the title track has the best drum work). Frontman Serj Tankien's often soulful vocals and lyrics help make this album heavy in both meanings of the word. Some people hate SOAD simply because their a political band. That's too bad, and it's their loss. Some songs (i.e. \\"Prison Song\\") have lyrical content that does deal with politics and politically related issues (\\"Jet Pilot\\" is about war, and \\"Deer Dance\\" is about police brutality.) But, for the most part, this is a \\"socially aware\\" band, not a political one. (Elsewhere, there are lyrics about over population, drugies, groupies, science \\"failing mother earth,\\" religion/spirituality, pollution, and suicide.) Sure, there are some songs (\\"Bounce\\") that were made just to get mosh pits swirling, but this is a very deep and thought provoking album and there are many lessons to be learned from the lyrics. If you learn nothing else from this review, know that this album is a masterpiece.
0802130208|5.0|In a sentence, this novel BLEW me away! I thought that a Prize winning novel would be stogy and intellectually stimulating or code for a (snooze fest). I love Ignatius and his quirky character. Think of this novel as a George Castanza meets Frankenstein. The characters are quirky and Hilarious. J.KT creates long passages of dialogue between Ignatius (the pigheaded fool) and his neighbors, mother, bosses, co-workers, strippers, police and girlfriend, all with hilarious outcome.  <br />Ignatius just has to open his mouth even when you know he should keep quite. He is Fat, Lazy, cheap, arrogant  and a genius with Diction. I had to use a dictionary in some instances just to follow his words. But this is a novel where his miserable behavior doesn't go unpunished. For the life of me I can't understand why this was never made into a movie, play and even a musical. The Misadventures of Ignatius Reilly. This is one of my favorite novels I have ever READ PERIOD!!! <br />
B000092Q4U|5.0|Even though they weren't signed to a major label, Lamb of God made a major jump in popularity with this album. And there's a reason for that. Lamb of God is probably the best (and most promising) New Wave of American Heavy Metal band, and \\"As the Palaces Burn\\" is one of the most brutal and contagious albums of the year. Everything is here for a great metalcore album: fiery guitar riffs (which echo Pantera and Testament), very talented drum work (much of which is a persistent and fast double bass), Cookie Monster vocals, tempo/beat changes, a few ripping guitar solos, heavy breakdowns, and an overall wall of sound that is downright brutal and almost impenetrable. Highlights include the concert favorite \\"Ruin\\" (which is probably the album's best track and has a great breakdown), \\"Purified\\" (featuring a guest appearance by ex-Megadeth ace Chris Poland), \\"11th Hour\\" (which might be the album's most catchy and well known cut), \\"A Devil in God's Country\\" (which has an almost mind-boggling guitar and drum give-and-take), and \\"Blood Junkie\\" (which has numerous beat changes and more insane drum work). The brutality of this album takes the listener a while to get used to, but once you warm up to it, you'll realize \\"As the Palaces Burn\\" is one hell of an album.
B00000JHAU|5.0|This is truly one of the great albums of recent years.  One of the reviews said that they \\"disagreed that this is a rainy day album, but that rather it was a sunny road trip record.\\"  Personally, I believe that it is both.  It is a beautifully done record that can be scene as a sunny road trip record, or as a record to reflect to while sitting inside watching the rain spatter against the windows.  With a single listen you don't realize all the nuances of this CD and just how great it is. <br /> <br />This was the soundtrack to my spring break in New York City and will forever bring me back to NYC whenever I here any of these songs.  Belle and Sebastian incorporate a number of sounds to make their own distinct sound.  If you like the Shins or Tegan and Sara, I believe that you will enjoy this CD. <br /> <br />Ratings of songs (Every song got an A, simply one of my all time favorite CDs): <br />1. The Stars of Track and Field - \\"A\\" This moody song has a number of different levels to it and is simply beautifully done. <br /> <br />2. Seeing Other People - \\"A\\" This is a light hearted song, a nice pick-me-up after the previous track.  Once again beautifully done.   <br /> <br />3. Me and the Major - \\"A\\" Yet another great song.  Combination of the harmonica and piano sound great in the fast paced song.  Nice lyrics. <br /> <br />4. Like Dylan in the Movies - \\"A\\" Continues the fast pace of the previous track but turns its that fast pace into a whole different song.  Becomes wistful (rainy day song perhaps) <br /> <br />5. The Fox in the Snow - \\"A\\" Another \\"rainy day\\" song.  Beautiful and fragile.  Piano and guitar are great together. <br /> <br />6. Get Me Away From Here, I'm Dying - \\"A\\" Great song.  Picks up from The Fox in the Snow.   <br /> <br />7.  If You're Feeling Sinister - \\"A\\" Fast guitar with a nice piano part.  Kids playing in the background is a nice touch.  Makes you reminisce about childhood. <br /> <br />8. Mayfly - \\"A\\" Different sound to the guitar as withthe previous tracks.  Awesome organ in the background.  Female vocal backing up main male vocal is great. <br /> <br />9.  The Boy Done Wrong Again - \\"A\\" Sad song.  Rainy day song.  Beautiful. <br /> <br />10.  Judy and the Dream of Horses - \\"A\\"  Nice cheery song that starts off sounding sad.  Great closing track. <br /> <br />EVERY SONG IS GREAT!
B00006AW2M|2.0|1967 was not the Stones' best year.  Mick and Keith were busted for trumped-up drugs charges which threatened to bury the band for good.  Meanwhile their Souse rivals, The Beatles, released the most celebrated album of the era, SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND.  Out of this chaos emerged The Stones' misguided response, SATANIC MAJESTIES.<br />For a brief time, MAJESTIES broke the momentum the band had built with their previous two (and excellent) albums -- AFTERMATH and BETWEEN THE BUTTONS.  MAJESTIES may not be the worst Stones' album of this era, but it's easily their most embarassing.  This is self-conscious psychedlia and doesn't sound convincing at all.  Doens't even sound like the Stones.<br />Only She's A Rainbow and 2000 Light Years From Home are memorable.  I own every Stones' album and I don't recall the other song titles.  This is how highly I regard this album.  When I do play it I soon reach for the superior REVOLVER and PEPPER.<br />Jagger's former paramour, Marianne Faithfull, hit it on the nose: The Beatles made psychedelic music far better than the Stones.  The Stones needed to stay rooted to the blues, which is sadly lacking from this poor collection of songs.
0790742780|5.0|I loved this movie.  Michael Douglas is masterful and plays one of the best anti-hero characters since DeNiro's Taxi Driver.  If you love dark comedies this movie is for you. <br /> <br />Michael Douglas plays a man (with a temper) who becomes overwhelmed with the \\"BS\\" of the world and finally fights back.  He proceeds to go on a rampage and act out against all the things he finds to be wrong in the world.   <br /> <br />This movie is great and is worth owning in one's DVD collection. <br /> <br />Movies I recommend in addition to this one OR movies that, if you liked them, I think you will like this: <br />-Welcome to the Dollhouse (Solondz) <br />-Any Quentin Tarantino <br />-Big Lebowski <br />-Taxi Driver
B00006EXCC|5.0|I'll go out on a limb and propose that the Golden Age of the Stones did not start with 1968's BEGGARS BANQUET, but with 1966's AFTERMATH (UK edition).  Apart from the regrettable &quot;Pepper&quot; rip-off, SATANIC MAJESTIES, the Stones recorded an amazing run of music from 1966 through EXILE in 1972.<br />AFTERMATH is the first album to feature entirely original songs.  No blues or soul covers, but all Jagger-Richards compositions.  In other words, the Stones find their voice -- a voice ringing with cynicism, tenderness, anger, frustration and yes, misogyny, but a voice that is uniquely their own.<br />AFTERMATH is teeming with great songs, starting with Mother's Little Helper, which broke taboos in the mid-60s by talking about over-the-counter drug addiction among American housewives.  Brian Jones puts the sitar to sinister effect.  Under My Thumb remains one of the Stones' best songs, though its anti-women lyrics continue to rankle many.  Out Of Time is one of the bands most haunting songs.  Like Under My Thumb, Out of Time uses a new instrument, the marimba, to maximum effect.  I Am Waiting and Lady Jane are two the Stones' most gentle yet bittersweet tunes, highlighted by thoughtful lyrics.  Overall, Jagger and Richards' songwriting shines.<br />Late 1965 and early 1966 was a fertile period for the Rolling Stones, who were The Beatles closest rivals.  Consider that 19th Nervous Breakdown and Paint It Black (which kicks off the US version of AFTERMATH) were recorded at this time.  Had these great singles and their B-sides replaced weaker songs (What To Do, the 11-minute Goin' Home), then AFTERMATH may have attained the mythic status that BEGGARS enjoyed.  (Hence, my 4.5-star reating instead of a full five.)<br />Ignore the bastardized U.S. version and pick up this far superior version of AFTERMATH.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|As you may have thought when seeing the ads for this movie, \\"not another Kung Pow: Enter the Fist movie...\\"  But this movie actually ended up being really great.  It is Stephen Chow's follow up to \\"Shaolin Soccer\\" and is really funny while having from seriously cool action scenes.  The subtitles may be somewhat distracting at times but don't let that stop you from going out and renting/buying this movie.  You will be pleasantly surprised.  If you enjoyed the action from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and enjoy silly comedy from slapstick movies, you will like this movie.
B000696PWC|4.0|It seems like Kylie Minogue has been with me all my life. Well, in actual fact, she has, since I was born in 1987. However, for a pop star to remain ever-present for 18 years is no mean feat, and something reserved for the true stars such as Madonna. Kylie has had limited success in America, but worldwide she is the closest thing to Madonna. Okay, on a global level, Britney Spears has surpassed Kylie in sales already, but Kylie has had longevity in Europe and Australia since the Eighties. She is a national treasure for Australia, and in England we also take her into our hearts: sometimes I forget that she is Australian, because she spends so much time in the UK. There is definitely a personal connection at work, because Kylie is totally true to herself and the nation loves her for it.<br /><br />\\"Ultimate Kylie\\" was released in late 2004 as a culmination of 17 years' hard work. This is the only comprehensive collection of Kylie Minogue's work as a solo artist, from pop princess, to difficult, indie darling, and back to true disco diva pop icon.<br /><br />The first CD contains all the single releases from Kylie that she released during her time with Stock, Aitken and Waterman. This was arguably the most successful era of her career, as she had 13 Top 10 UK hit singles right off the bat, which is the most successful start to a career for any female artist in the history of the British charts. She achieved this success over three years from early 1988 to mid-1991. This disc opens with the ever-popular \\"I Should Be So Lucky.\\" This is a pop classic and should not be dismissed as cheesy rubbish! It launched the career of an icon! From here on the hits keep flowing, from \\"Got To Be Certain,\\" \\"The Loco-Motion\\" and \\"Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi,\\" and onto massive UK No.1 hits such as \\"Especially For You\\" and \\"Hand On Your Heart.\\" These songs aren't particular favourites of mine. I'm sure this would be an entirely different story if I was listening to these pop hits five or six years ago, but I'm much happier listening to more mature music. This is pop music, nothing more and nothing less; it does its job in making people happy and that's fine. I'm not really familiar with hits such as \\"Wouldn't Change A Thing,\\" \\"Never Too Late\\" and \\"Tears On My Pillow,\\" but then there are some really good song that I love such as \\"Better The Devil You Know\\" and my personal early-Kylie favourites \\"Step Back In Time\\" and \\"What Do I Have To Do.\\" Songs such as \\"Shocked,\\" \\"Give Me Just A Little More Time\\" and \\"Celebration\\" round out this first disc, signal Kylie's decline from the charts in the early Nineties, but also herald the comeback that would storm the world later on.<br /><br />The second disc is my personal favourite, and it begins wonderfully with the amazing \\"Confide In Me.\\" Released in late 1994, this song saw indie Kylie launch herself upon us. This was a big hit in the UK peaking at No.2. This is followed by four songs which are probably the least memorable of Kylie's entire career; \\"Put Yourself In My Place,\\" \\"Where The Wild Roses Grow,\\" \\"Did It Again\\" and \\"Breathe.\\" Kylie took a break and returned two years later in 2000 with \\"Spinning Around,\\" which was a massive UK No.1 and her first for more than ten years. She followed this up with the incredible \\"On A Night Like This\\" and \\"Kids,\\" which both hit No.2 in the UK in 2000. \\"Please Stay\\" hit the Top 10 and rounded out her return. Kylie was back right, she couldn't get any bigger? Wrong. On rolled 2001 where she released \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head,\\" which stormed the charts worldwide, was No.1 in the UK for 4 weeks, and spent a total of 25 weeks on the chart. This came from the album \\"Fever,\\" which also spawned massive hits throughout 2002 such as \\"In Your Eyes,\\" \\"Love At First Sight\\" and \\"Come Into My World,\\" which are all present here in their glory. Kylie's 2003 album \\"Body Language\\" is the last album to feature heavily on this collection of hits, and from it we have three smash hits. The first is \\"Slow,\\" massive UK No.1 hit single from late 2003, followed by \\"Red Blooded Woman\\" and \\"Chocolate,\\" both of which made the UK Top 10 in 2004. This disc is rounded out by two brand new songs which were recorded especially for this album. \\"I Believe In You\\" hit No.2 in late 2004, and is one of Kylie's best songs ever in my opinion! \\"Giving It Up\\" was also another big UK Top 10 smash in 2005, and rounds out this collection in fine style.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />Kylie Minogue was diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2005, and is currently on the road to what I'm sure will be a full recover. The overwhelming sense of support Kylie received from her millions of devoted fans through this hard time has been very positive, and I believe Kylie will bounce back later in the year to complete The Showgirl Tour. In the meantime, we can bask in the glory that is Ultimate Kylie. This is the only album you'll need if you're a first-time Kylie listener, or simply a casual fan that is not willing to buy her studio albums.K No.1 hit single from late 2003, followed by \\"Red Blooded Woman\\" and \\"Chocolate,\\" both of which made the UK Top 10 in 2004.

B00007ELEL|5.0|I have seen nearly all the Coen brothers movies and this easily is the top one.  The plot is not so much the center of this movie.  What the Coen brothers focus on is character development and dialogue of which they have created a masterpiece.  Any Big Lebowski fan can quote you a large number of lines from the film and are all diehard. Of course it does take a certain type of person to like this film.  If you like... Pulp Fiction (Tarantino), Happiness (Solondz), and Falling Down (Schumacher), I believe you will also like this film.
B0009KQOLU|5.0|This movie is great and now you can watch it anywhere you go  <br />and trust me it's worth buying for your psp.
B000021YQV|5.0|I don't listen to much rock lately because I'm a fossil (Jimmy Page is a god to me) but I did like this album. It's different enough from all the other cookie-cutter mass consumption music that has been produced lately - any comments Himo?

B000002BQK|5.0|Mariah's metamorphosis album, Butterfly, was the start of phase two of Mariah's music career.  Mariah was divorcing Tommy Mottola, she changed her look, and this album was the first of future albums to feature hip-hop collaborations.  But one thing that definitely has not changed:  THE VOICE!!!  Mariah's beautiful, powerful, soaringly 7 octave voice is as prominent as ever!!  And I love phase two of Mariah as much as phase one because even with the more hip-hop and R&B sound, Mariah's voice truly shines so I love it all!!<br /><br />The first single, Honey, was Mariah's 3rd #1 single to debut on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 1!  At this point, 3 of Mariah's singles debuted at #1 with Fantasy and One Sweet Day.  I love Honey, it's a really cool upbeat song.  I actually like the Bad Boy Remix best because it just sounds cooler.  Butterfly is my all time favorite ballad from this album and Mariah's voice is amazing!  I love the lyrics \\"Spread Your Wings And Prepare To Fly, For You Have Become A Butterfly.\\"<br /><br />My All became another #1 on Billboard.  This ballad is my 2nd favorite ballad on this album.  It's such a wonderful, romantic ballad with Spanish guitar.  I love it!!  The Roof is a really cool R&B song and I really like the music itself as well, it's really unique.  The song Fourth Of July is said to be the sister song to Underneath The Stars and I can see why since they do sound alike in some ways but I can notice a difference.  It's a wonderful slow ballad with the sound of birds and Mariah's high notes.  Breakdown is a mix of R&B and Hip-Hop featuring Krayzie Bone and Wish Bone from Bone Thugs & Harmony and more birds if you really listen.  It's a cool song, not one of my all time favorites but I still like it a lot.  Babydoll is a cool R&B song that I really like.  I love the music that goes along with it.<br /><br />Close My Eyes is a really cool mid-tempo song with this melody with the piano that I also love!  The song Whenever You Call is another favorite and and I love the lyric \\"And You, Have Opened My Heart, And Lifted Me Inside, By Showing Me Yourself Undisguised.\\"  There is another version with Brian McKnight but I love the version with just Mariah more!!  Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise) is a cool short version of the whole Fly Away Club Mix and I love it.  You can get up and dance for a few minutes!!  The remake that Mariah chose for this album is The Beautiful Ones which is originally by Prince.  Mariah sings this ballad with Dru Hill and it's an amazing cover.  I totally love the way Mariah sings in this song, I totally love it!!  Outside is the album closer and it's cool how the tempo changes from slow in the beginning to mid-tempo in the middle.  It's a great album closer and a very personal message about how Mariah feels like she's on the outside.<br /><br />Butterfly may be more R&B and Hip-Hop flavored but any TRUE Mariah Carey fan will accept and embrace it like all her other albums.  I have, I love it, as I am a TRUE Mariah fan who has always stood by her and her music and always will until the end of time!!nother favorite and and I love the lyric \\"And You, Have Opened My Heart, And Lifted Me Inside, By Showing Me Yourself Undisguised.\\"  There is another version with Brian McKnight but I love the version with just Mariah more!!

B0007LXPBI|5.0|At a summer camp in Maine, 11-year-old Hallie Parker (Lindsay Lohan) meets Annie James (also Lindsay Lohan). Despite a curious resemblance, Hallie develops an immediate dislike for Annie, and the feeling is mutual. However, the two eventually discover they are twin sisters separated not long after they were born. Their parents, Elizabeth (Natasha Richardson) and Nick (Dennis Quaid), had met on the Queen Elizabeth 2 and married on that same voyage. After a divorce, Nick brought up Hallie at his Napa Valley vineyard, while Annie lived with wedding-gown designer Elizabeth in London. Neither twin was aware she had a sister, until their summer-camp meeting. To learn more about their parents, they switch places and maintain the deception until Nick states he will remarry. The twins then try to engineer a renewed romance between Nick and Elizabeth, but Nick's annoying but attractive fiancee Meredith (Elaine Hendrix) presents a major problem in reaching their happy-ending goal. <br /> <br />The picture quality   is razor sharp  that if you were to touch  the screen with  your finger, you would get cut!!!  Thats how super  sharp this movie is on this DVD!!     <br /> <br />The extras are great.  Theres an original   making of piece which  has Lindsay talking on the set of how fun it is making the movie and theres also  comments from  some of the others who are in the movie.   <br /> <br />Theres a neat  special  on how they   did the split screen  process to make it seem as if Lindsay is  interacting with her twin sister!!  Its amazing how good this process is!! <br /> <br />In watching this movie, you really   feel as if  it really is  twin girls. Lindsay did a super job  in playing her 2 roles!!! <br /> <br />The one thing that is missing from this special edition DVD is the trailer to this movie which was included on the original release DVD from a few years ago.   <br /> <br />Most of the extras on  this special  edition DVD came off of the laserdisc version  and one thing  they did not  put on this special  edition DVD that is on the laserdisc version is, Lindsay's screen  tests. They should have put this on the DVD but, for some unknown reason  they  did not.   <br /> <br />You may ask: \\"is this DVD worth getting since I allready have the DVD version that came out a few years ago?\\", The answer is YES!Reason is, of course the extras that are on  this and also because the picture quality is much better then the original DVD version,as they did remaster it!!    <br /> <br />This is a true winning  and wonderful  DVD!!   <br /> <br />
B00005JNTX|5.0|Going to the movies can be so incredibly dissapinting these days. It seems like almost every movie that seems to have any sort of promise or tries something different falls flat on it's face in the process. Enter Sin City. Dont bother with the back story just sit down and watch. You can't help but be glued to the screen, all the characters are amazing. Marv is easy the tour de force of the movie, but there are also nice little surprises, for example the two thugs that speak to each other using elegant prose. I cannot recommend this movie enough. If you are a person who can't watch violence skip this one. Keep watching the boring predictable trash hollywood throws your way.
B0007OCG56|3.0|This movie is worthwhile for the opportunity to watch the Spanish actress Paz Vega as Flor.  She is beautiful, and charming, although her character in this movie is a bit predictable.  The other main characters I found offensive, but perhaps that is part of the plot.    Sandler has a problem completing a sentence.  He plays a wimpish character who, as Flor said, acts like a old Mexican housewife.  And Leoni's character was too abrasive, abusive, stupid and self-preoccupied to be believed.  That she and Sandler and their two children were part of the same family just did not make any sense, either in real life or in fiction.    The movie barely had a story line, so without interesting characters there is nothing there.  But watch it just to see Paz Vega.
B0002I831S|5.0|Nominated for four Emmys, including Outstanding Dramatic Series two times in its short three-year stint, Star Trek is a true legend of television history. The brainchild of former L.A. policeman Gene Roddenberry, the show premiered in Fall 1966 only to be cancelled after three seasons due to lackluster ratings. But it may well have been NBC's network executives who were the cause of the low ratings as they allotted a less than desirable time slot for the show. When Star Trek moved into syndication, its reruns captured the science-fiction imagination of an entirely new audience, catapulting the Star Trek franchise to new heights.

0316172324|2.0|I think this book would be a pleasurable and interesting read for those of you who have never taken a psychology or biology course in college (or even high school). I am very interested in the human mind and have taken a few psychology courses in college, and I thought that this book would enhance my knowledge. Unfortunately, there was absolutely nothing new that I took away from this book. It was basically an over-simplified repition of things taught on the very first day of an introductory psychology class. If your time is valuable to you and you really want to learn something substantial on the subject, don't bother with this book.

B0007TKNL0|3.0|First off, I have never seen the stage production, never read the book, never knew nothing about this movie untill I rented it. I dont really like musicals but this I kind of liked. I never heard the original singers or anything so I didnt find anything wrong with the singing other than some of the style is not really my type.  <br /> <br />Anyway, lets start off with what I do like. The movie is visually stunning. I love the sets and stuff. The beginning I thought was great! It draws you in nice and easy building mystery around the opera house and the Phantom. The music is nice, the story is building. What I really like is when Christine is in her room and the candles blow out and you hear the booming voice of the Phantom in the shadows and finally appears in the mirror and leads Christine down a secret passage down into depths of the opera house. The song here is great, the visuals are stunning, you can feel that the Phantom and Christine have this romantic vibe going on. I loved the movie at this point.  <br /> <br />UNFORTUNATLY... <br /> <br />After this Christine removes the Phantoms mask and he flips out. Christine leaves and then SUDDENLY falls for a childhood friend. Well the love between them doesnt feel very real nor is there any fire going on that you feel when she was with the Phantom earlier. This is where things start to slide I think. The music becomes redundant and none of the songs after the main theme song, \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" which was sung during the desent to the Phantoms lair, are as good or feel as awesome. Christine and the Phantoms romance is never there again after she takes off the mask. The Phantom feels more like a creepy stalker than a sympathetic person. The movie drags on for too long and the mystery and intreague that was there in the beginning is completely gone. The ending is not tragic at all because you feel nothing for the Phantom like you are supposed to. Had there still felt like a romantic connection was still there between Christine and the Phantom, the ending would have felt alot more tragic and you would feel a little more for the Phantom as he wouldnt seen as just an evil obsessed stalker. <br /> <br />Anyway, I recommend the film cause I think you should watch it at least once. I hear the problems that I have with the movie are not there in the stage version as there is more mystery throught the story and you feel more of a connection between the Phantom and Christine. I dont know what the core problem of WHY the movie didnt work out as well as the stage play but I can deffenatly feel something is missing and left me disappointed in the end. I was also hoping for something a little darker but thats just a personal prefrence =P
B00000J2PH|5.0|I'll always remember 1971 so well even though I was just 10 years old. It was the year my family moved from Boston to Alexandria, Egypt. A 10 year old really has no firm comprehension of what kind of cultural change they will experience by moving from the familiar surroundings of home in a city like Boston to a radically different setting like Alexandria. <br /> <br />This album was almost a soundtrack to that time for me. I was top 40 fan since I got my first AM radio for Christmas in 1968. I grew a real fondness for killer pop songs. This album is full of them. I can remember having so many of the songs on this album stuck in my head as I was on the long flight to Egypt. In particular, to this day, I have mental and visual imagery of the song \\"So Far Away\\" running in an almost endless loop as we flew further and further away. <br /> <br />Flash forward 34 years... Here I am at a restaraunt with my daughters last night and I hear them singing along to a remake of \\"I Feel The Earth Move\\" by a contemporary artist Martika. <br /> <br />After dinner we we out shopping so I stopped into a music store and picked up a copy of Tapestry. I popped the disc into the CD player for the ride home and immediately got the \\"eeeeewwws!\\" from my daughters when they heard this \\"old and slow\\" version of the song! I ignored them and let it play on. <br /> <br />The soungs sounded really great to me after all of these years. I couldn't believe how many memories it brought back. I also had a much improved appreciation for the music given the tremendous miles my ears have covered since 1971! <br /> <br />One last uncanny point. I couldn't get over how much \\"It's too Late\\" sounds like Todd Rundgren! That song could easily have been on his album of the same era, \\"Something/Anything\\".
B0002858YS|1.0|alright, so if i could give this crap ZERO stars i would.  true, true, i haven't heard the whole album, but what i have heard makes my teeth hurt.  for the sake of my future children, the only song i've heard on what i'm sure is an otherwise unremarkable album is the train wreck known as \\"mr. brightside.\\"  this song is a BLATANT RIP-OFF OF UNDERWORLD!!!  i'm not the biggest underworld fan to have walked the face of the earth, and i probably wouldn't have ever heard of / cared about the killers otherwise, but it's still wrong to COPY / MIMIC / STEAL another band's sound just because you're too lame to think of anything on your own and you know it will get some quick attention.  shame, shame, killers... i've already forgotten your name.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Don't give up on Out of Exile.  With tracks like Drown Me Slowly, #1 Zero, and Worm just to name a few, the CD undoubtedly will grow on you after about 3 or 4 listens.  After the first two listens, I was not overly impressed due to the fact that this album is a little softer than their debut.  That being said, I have come to really enjoy this one (even Doesn't Remind Me...which I thought was really cheesy at first) and have had it in my car CD player for a week now.  Solid.
B0001CNRB6|5.0|Doris Day is the greatest of all living movie stars and it is an unbelievable oversight that she has not been awarded an honorary Oscar for her lifetime achievement.<br /><br />Here in LOVER COME BACK she plays Carol Templeton, an advertising executive who learns what it's like to have to play the sleazy way.  It's the kind of part that Ida Lupino had played in a previous generation of tough-talking actresses, but the script has Doris playing it light, though as all her fans know, when she gets mad, it's even funnier.  She stops still, juts out her lower lip, and shoots a jet of breath up her face to tousle her bangs.  Here she's upset with Rock Hudson's character, the louche playboy Jerry Templeton, and his cut-throat ways and me-first philosophy; but as usual she doesn't know it's him when she meets Rock, who lets her think he's a client instead of a competitor who despises her.<br /><br />Yes, as other reviewers have noted, this is a film with a lot of hard edges, it's brittle and even bitter, like THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS.  The Madison Avenue background was so popular in studio films of the early 60s--was it that Hollywood screenwriters had at last found a job description even more venal and phoney than their own, and thus could deliver venom on target?  Edie Adams plays \\"Rebel\\" as though she were the star of the movie, daring the camera to move away from her body; she's very funny in what might be her most convincing part.  Rock is great, but you can't help feeling that the movie is tilted towards Doris; Rock's a good sport who let Doris run away with the acting honors in all of their films together.  It's not that he couldn't act, or that he was too far down on the food chain of stardom to have his part re-written to make it larger (or more sympathetic).  He chose not to, making him the most chivalrous actor in Hollywood and the perfect complement to Doris' often abused persona.  Finally, a guy who didn't walk all over her.  We'd love him for that alone, even if he didn't appear nude but for a fur coat in this delightful Universal romp.even if he didn't appear nude but for a fur coat in this delightful Universal romp.
B00005AQF7|5.0|And this cd hands down is still one of the best. This is a must have, even if you rarely like rap, like I do. Most of the songs I knew of snoop dogg were the ones he released as singles, but after buying this cd, there are also others songs just as good if not better than those. Highly recommended.
B0000000LI|5.0|Yanni's music has always been full of emotion, which is why I really like his music. I love music that speaks to the listener, especially instrumentals. The notes, and melodies take me away. Only 3 artists do this-Yanni, Ryan Farish, and Enya. There is a passion felt in their music. Yanni is so talented, and this classic album is him and his band at their finest.
B000002GQE|5.0|It's remarkable to consider how different this music must have sounded to anyone listening to it at the time.  As a member of a much younger generation I can't possibly grasp how this album affected music at the time, but I will say that it, like all of The Moody Blues' classic seven albums, it one of the most smoothly produced recordings I have listened to.  I've had the good fortune to listen to it while out for a walk as the sun was setting, and one of the great things is that the music actually does flow with the progression of time, which makes it a great listen while enjoying the solitude of the moment. <br /> <br />While the two hit singles \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" and \\"Nights and White Satin\\" do stand out, I would consider it an injustice to this album to look at these two tracks as the pillars of the album in any way, shape or form.  At the same time, it is wise to consider the album by its A and B sides.  The beginning of the album is much happier, with traditional sixties flair and perk.  The really progressive material, and my favourite part, starts with the B side, but is explored equally well through all three (five) songs with each leading into the next. <br /> <br />In conclusion, pick this album up if you're the kind of person who likes to sit and just think or look at the world around you, as it's certainly reflective music, not intrusive if you don't want it to be, but certainly not musak by any stretch of the imagination.  It's a study in well-made and well-produced music, and while I can see why some will find it prententious or too laid-back, I'll happily give it five stars and listen to it regularly.
B00001OH7X|4.0|...makes this release all the more interesting.    David Bowie was coming to a crossroad w/ Brian Eno. Bowie felt he had to take some control back of his own work which starts to show as Eno's presence isn't that predominant as on the past 2 releases prior. Gone from the album are ambient workouts like \\"Moss Garden\\" and \\"Art Decade\\". Instead the work showed a greater interest in twisting strange atmospheres into pop songs which would foreshadow the best parts of New Wave, as well as touching upon the post-punk movement that was running along the side of it at the same time.      The opener \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" is excellent, almost an overture to the rest of the LP, acting like an updated song from \\"Three Penny Opera\\". A cousin to \\"5 Years\\". \\"African Night Flight\\" has often been sited as bizarre but its one of the best tracks on Lodger (if not in his career) that puts an agressive view to world music, just like the Talking Heads would do in Remain In Light a year later. The rest of the songs travel in and out foreign lands, haphazzard fashions, regret and sexual politics (of being a boy and abuse). \\"Repetition\\" is one of the most point blank views on marital abuse ever (which was later cover by the feminist punkers The Au Pairs). The voyage ends on a sour prediction about the decade greed that was to come our way in the 1980s (\\"Red Money\\").    Of course, the record company robs us of \\"I Pray, Ole\\" in this remastered reissue. But noticing the current rate of the anniversary packaged albums being produced maybe we'll see something (however I wouldn't hold my breath).       I understand why many wouldn't think this is Bowie's best work, especially looking at his whole career. But for some reason every time I listen to it I feel that it is my favorite one.     Definitely overlooked, so please give it a try.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|I must recognize that from those ancient times of The chase, The Day of the Jackal, Midnight express and Marathon Man, I had never seen so spectacular and struggling human chase like in this movie.<br /><br />Jason Borne is an expensive mistake that it must be found and exterminated. He worked out as a failure human experiment but something goy out of control and now the things are getting worse. The whole locations and handle camera are first rate. Joan Allen shines as the implacable hunter, following every little step of Bourne through several cities.<br /><br />The main character leaded by Mark Damon I found excessively overacted. But the kinetic script makes you forget this little comment.<br /><br />Somehow this is one the few sequels that overcame the first part. The car chase in the coda of the movie is a real visual tour de force, extraordinary well made.<br /><br />Recommended without reserves.
B0002NRQTS|5.0|I admit it, the synth era of Rush is my favorite, but the musical excellence of Presto simply cannot be ignored.  Fans either hate this album, saying 'Show Don't Tell and The Pass are the only decent tracks,' or they love the album.  I used to ignore this album from the catolog, but after one day deciding to give the entire record a spin, it completely changed my opinion. <br /> <br />1. Show Don't Tell 5/5 - Simply put: fantastic. <br />2. Chain Lightning 3/5 - A pretty good song; a bit more synth than others. <br />3. The Pass 5/5 - One of Rush's favorites. The lyrics are outstanding. <br />4. War Paint 5/5 - I gotta say, this track is very overlooked. It's now one I listen to frequently. <br />5. Scars 5/5 - Very catchy song; it's not rock, but you'll love it. <br />6. Presto 4/5 - Starts out a bit suger-coated (sparkle sounds), like something Sammy from Van Halen would do, but the song as a whole is very well done. <br />7. Superconductor 4/5 - Could have easily been a North American smash. <br />8. Anagram 3/5 - I guess you could call this a 'track-filler' but similarly to 'Emotion Detector' on Power Windows, Rush makes it unforgetable. <br />9. Red Tide 5/5 - One of the best on the album. All-around great track. <br />10. Hand Over Fist 5/5 - Anyone who can make a song out of 'Rock-Paper-Scissors', and well, deserves a lot of praise. <br />11. Available Light 5/5 - Great closer. You'll likely listen to this one frequently. <br /> <br />I know, my judging is very bias but it really is a great album, leading up to an even better one, Roll the Bones. Just listen to it as a whole and you'll see why this album deserves so much recognition.

077106506X|4.0|RUNAWAY is one fantastic collection, the same way McCraes CHILDRENS CORNER is and the way HAUNTED is.  All are stellar short stories and thank goodness that these authors are still plowing the fertile ground of this genre.  The story whose impact lingers longest is &quot;Powers&quot; which is too big in all ways to try and summarize. Read it, and be moved by writing that seems beyond storytelling, that feels like Truth Itself. Reading Munro at the height of her art is like listening to John Coltrane play the saxophone - there's a point where analysis breaks down and all you can do is pay homage to genius.  I highly recommend that you check out this wonderful collection today.
B00002ZMNV|4.0|for the dvd s&m live honestley it was a great kick butt dvd.And the features how you can hear the band or mixed with composer Micheal Kaman was cool. But during the dvd i noticed that the heaviest song they played at the end was Battery which was cool all together the dvd was great good job Metallica. Only one flaw though was the setlist they could have adjusted it a little bit but it was good. If it was my show though i would set it up like this: <br />1. The Ecstacy Of Gold <br />2. Call Of Kutlu <br />3. Master Of Puppets <br />4. Fade To Black <br />5. Memory Remains <br />6. No Leaf Clover <br />7. For Whom The Bell Tolls <br />8. Battery <br />9. Nothing Else Matters <br />10. Enter Sandman <br />11. One <br />12. Fuel <br />13. Wherever I May Roam <br />14. Sad But True <br />15. Damage Inc. <br />16. D****S Dance <br />17. The Unforgiven <br />18. The Thing That Shouldnt <br />19. I Dissapear <br />20. Harvester Of Sorrows <br />21. Sanitarium Welcome Home <br />this would be list great dvd guys kicks but great set list <br />METALLICA ROCKS
B00005OAIE|1.0|dear lord, please make untalented people stop getting record deals.  i beg of thee...
B000002BMV|5.0|I was 14 when who's crying now came across the radio , first time ever heard it, couldn't believe the power in this song, listened all night to hear it again and again ,it was the perfect song, vocals, music. from that day on every hit song on the album and on the other albums was such a big part of my teenage life. Journey of the 80s could very well be the peak of all great  music in history. This is what the pioneers of music had invisioned some day in doing so much to capture our hearts and spirits.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I really love this album. I got into the Clash because a former friend of mine is a Clash fan. Strummer and Jones are amazing, gifted and talented. RIP Joe Strummer. Paul Simonon's Guns of Brixton was stuck in my head for days. I am truly a Clash fan now. I got the album for Christmas and I've been listening to it since. I heard that their other albums weren't as good. Eventually I will get some more Clash albums.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|I have been an Eagles fan since their first album in 1972.  I was just learning to play guitar then and I learned every song on that album.  Unlike a lot of people, I consider their high point as a band to be \\"On the Border\\".  It was still true to their roots, but showed they had some influences beyond Graham Parsons, Poco, and the Byrds. <br /> <br />The performance in this concert is excellent for the aging hit-machine that the Eagles are.  The songs have stood up well over time and the new songs show they've still got it in the songwriting department.  As a showman, Joe Walsh is a treat to watch, as always.  The rest of the band is fantastic, as usual, but, like others, I miss Don Felder.  The \\"random schmo\\" on guitar referred to in another review is Steuart Smith, one of the finest session guitarists in all of music.  He has played extensively in Nashville, as well as for Don Henley's solo projects.  His playing is impeccable. <br /> <br />Since the Eagles have always been known for their remarkable ability to duplicate their studio sound in concert, there were very few new things brought to the songs in this concert, but, as most fans would agree, that's not why we watched.  We watched to see a great band perform songs that are timeless and that take us back to a time when we had fewer cares and worries.  In this, they succeeded.
0671027387|4.0|Dan Brown's \\"Deception Point\\", a fascinating mix of science and politics to create a fast moving thriller, ultimately bogs down as the book nears its conclusion.  What was a marginally believeable premise degenerates into an all too handy ending.<br /><br />The plot commences in the political arena of Washington D.C.  Delaware Senator Sedgewick Sexton's presidential aspirations are picking up momentum as he continues a policy of bashing NASA, as synthesized by his youthful, ambitious assistant Gabrielle Ashe.  The self centered, womanizing and loathesome Sexton has harped on the overspending agency which has recently met with a series of technological mishaps and failures at an enormous expense to taxpayers.  Incumbent president Zachary Hearney, basically a moral and righteous man, for a politician is rapidly losing his political base as a result of the scathing NASA attacks.  He refuses to fight back much to the dismay of his staff.<br /><br />Rachel Sexton, daughter of the widowed senator, is a high ranking analyst in the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), a covert government espionage organization.  Rachel, estranged from her father, is summoned to NRO director William Pickering's office.  She learns that President Hearney desires her participation in a clandestine mission.  She is skeptical, as is Pickering, that she will be used as a political pawn in the re-election fight.<br /><br />Hearney would like Rachel to be part of a civilian contingent to corroborate an utterly fantastic scientific discovery which will shake the foundations of the world.  A recently enabled NASA device called PODS has made an improbable find in the Milne Ice Shelf in the North Pole.  PODS, sort of a satellite based ground piercing radar, is able to detect variations in ice density to check for evidence of global warming.  The device inadvertantly picked up a solid mass entombed in the ice which was discovered to be a huge meteorite.  When samples were taken, fossils contained within the meteorite were found.  Due to the extraterrestrial nature of meteorites, this proved the existence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe,  Such a revelation would bolster NASA's image as well as its staunchest supporter President Hearney.<br /><br />Along with Rachel Sexton, celebrated oceanographer Michael Tolland, a contemporary and matinee idol version of Jacques Cousteau and other scientists were entrenched in a polar habitat involved with analysis and retrieval of the meteorite.  Little did they know, they were all being observed by 3 covert Delta force operatives bivouaced nearby.<br /><br />The president chose to keep the discovery secret, opportunistically waiting for the precise moment to reveal the find and dash the ambitions of Senator Sexton.  His senior advisor the gaunt and chain smoking Marjorie Trench, was working on the inside, trying to reign in Sexton's attacks by blackmailing his assistant Gabrielle Ashe.<br /><br />As the investigation of the meteorite moved forward, inquiries conducted by eminent glaciologist Norah Mangor brought up perplexing questions.  The scientists were beginning to have doubts about it's authenticity.  Was this a hoax orchestrated by head of NASA, Lawrence Ekstrom?  If so, by whose backing?  Scientists at the habitat began getting murdered adding fuel to the already rapidly paced plot.<br /><br />The story proceeds bouncing back and forth between Washington and the Arctic.  The plot, while intriguing, stalls noticeably, once the controller behind the whole adventure is revealed.  Brown endeavors to find a soft landing spot for his conclusion buts ends the novel with a ridiculous set of circumstances which are too convenient to be fathomable.within the meteorite were found.

B0007OCG4W|1.0|It took me awhile to see this movie, but I recently caught it on Pay-per-View. I have heard all the hype, but I just don't get it. I was not appalled by the foul language or the adulterous storyline. It was just the movie in general that I did not like. It seemed so pointless. I mean, I thought that it would be very in-depth, thought provoking. I did not feel that it lived up to all the publicity. Also, as a former Julia Roberts fan, I never thought I'd say this, but I am getting sooo tired of her. If you are looking for a more intimate film of the same genre, try \\"We Don't Live Here Anymore\\".
B000099T2L|3.0|Beyonce has an AMAZING voice but this album wasn't great. I liked only the singles on the album, \\"Signs\\", and \\"Yes\\". I don't know why, but I prefer her work with DC. I mean she's talented, but the songs just weren't that great. I think she had way too many collaborations. She could do a lot better without all of the collaborations.
B000002UJQ|5.0|first of all, anyone who talks about radiohead stating they are an overated useless band has never listened to them. because im sure if they ever listened to them, their opinions would change instantly, and by that i mean really listen. This is such an amazing album it makes me wonder if there could be a better album ever.<br /><br />I bought this album as my first Radiohead album. i first listened to the opening track, and im thinkin, i can handle this. I listened to it in my room, alone, with headphones. and it intranced me, how genious this band is. Sure some people might think its experimental no talent crap... But they dont look past the true beauty of it, because they arent mature enough to appreciate good music. they are too busy listening to their meaningless britney and fitty cent, and are too worried about whats on TRL.... I say if want to apprecaite radiohead, you need to apprecaite music...<br /><br />This album is a classic, maybe even more then a classic...
B0002X314C|1.0|I've just heard a few tracks from this CD and I must say...if I never hear it again that will be to soon. Recommended by some people (who I used to consider my friends). I'm open to all sorts of music, but this completely boring egotrip was just plain irritating. It made me want to get up and throw out the CD, and I don't usually react to music like that, even the sort I don't like. Somebody should have told Mr. Legend (not) to try another profession.
B0000VCZKW|1.0|This is a wonderful film, but I saw it in the theatre and am outraged that it is being realeased yet again in the pan and SCAM format.  This film is so wide that you lose more than half the picture!!!  This is a joke of a special edition.  Audiences are fed up with getting cropped images on their DVDs.  Every time you buy a so called \\"fullscreen\\" (euphemism for cropped) disc, the terrorists win.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I keep reading reviews on all the films I have any interest in and I can't believe I've seen the same movie as the critic many times.  Achilles, Hector, their fight scene in this film is an absolute masterpiece especially when you realize they actually took lessons and performed their fighting scenes themselves.  I think you will find that all fhe fight scenes in this film are absolutely spectacular.  Pitt's portrayal of Achilles is extremely well done.  I thought it was very interesting the way they came up with a fighting style to be used by Achilles and how great the fight scenes look.  Bana as Hector is perfect for this part and perfect in this part.  It's wonderful to have all the bonus material available so you can learn details with regard to the background of these films.    Bloom's character, Paris, is an absolute wimp in this film and he looks like he is about 15 yrs old to Helen's (Kruger's)30+ yrs.  I really have trouble with these two characters because they gave so little consideration to the consequence of their actions.  It's no surprise that Paris learned to use a bow and arrow so he could be at a nice, safe distance while killing the soldiers who were fighting in hand to hand combat.  I think this may be the reason you see such rage in Achilles' face in the last scene with Paris. Evidently, there was a code about fights and who could do what to whom and when they could do it.  Paris did not follow the rules.  I have to admit that Bloom playing this part was very good because he really made me angry at his absurd behavior and his lack of character.  Give me Achilles and/or Hector any day    There is so much covered in this film. You really need to see it.  The biggest discrepancy is that this war seems to cover about a 3 week period when in fact it lasted 10 years.  This aside however you find the love story with regard to Achilles and Briseis very appealing.  The musical score is beautiful and adds a great deal to the film.  The performances are very unique and extremely well done.  You'll love it.
B0000025K9|5.0|i am a girl, and it pains me to see 2 girls below me who can't decipher sarcasm when it slaps them across the face. beethoven a crappy piano player? ashlee simpson punk rock genius? ozzy a metal poser? c'mon girls obviously MTV Rocks is just kidding. that said, this album is probably the best thing ozzy did since paranoid w/ black sabbath. (or has done since.) if you have to own ONE ozzy record, this is it. (and don't get that crappy 'remix' version with the extra songs, get this used or the one with the little album cover in the middle of the swirly background.)
B00097A5I6|4.0|Well, the truth is, and you can believe it, that this albu, is better than heathen chemistry and standing on the shoulders of giants, is a great album, and I really like some song from those albums, such as Sunda Morning Call, Where did it all go wrong, Songbird and Stop Crying Your Heart Out, but this album, is REALLY great, from my opinion is wade better than X&Y from coldplay, you don't get tired of listening Don't believe the truth, every song is different, is my song by song review: <br /> <br />1.Turn Up The Sun - This and Lyla are the most classic Oasis song of the album, it starts with an intro keyboard who sound like the intro of City Of Blinding Lights From U2, and then the guitars get in, is a cool song to hear, 8/10 <br /> <br />2.Mucky Fingers - It's a really grower, the first time I heard it I said, horrible!! but after a few hearings you change your mind, is not one of the best of the album but it doesn't bother you to listen to it, the armonica solo is great but it could be better, and Liam could sang it too. 7/10 <br /> <br />3.Lyla - The first single, well, if you are an Oasis fan, you should like this song, the verse is the same tone of Street Fighting Man from the Rolling Stones, is a good song, it's very Oasis, I like the drums of this song, and specially those guitar and drums changes of the prechorus. 8/10 <br /> <br />4.Love Like A Bomb - Made by Liam, When i rode about this song, they've said, one for the ladies, Songbird 2, well, I prefer Songbird, and I expected more from this song, but it stills a great song, I like the percussions arrengements. 8/10 <br /> <br />5.The Importance Of Being Idle - One of my favourites, I never expected Noel to do a song like this, is great!! totally retro, it blows you away from the very first listening, Noel's voice sound great, the guitar solos are amazing, the chorus keyboard is too, is one of my favorite Oasis songs ever. 10/10 <br /> <br />6.The Meaning Of Soul - Noel: \\"Elvis On Redbull\\", is the perfect compliment for the importance of being idle, is really elvis, but I've got boried of this song, the first time I heard it I was shocked of it's sound, but you kinda get boried of this song, advice: Don't hear it a lot and you will enjoy it more. 8/10 <br /> <br />7.Guess God Thinks I'm Abel: A grower, Excelent to relax yourself, Liam sings great. 8/10 <br /> <br />8.Part Of The Queue: Another grower, and one of my favorites on the album, it's just great, those percussions of Lenny Castro, that outro piano is amazing, Noel sings great, I like it a lot. 9/10 <br /> <br />9.Keep The Dream Alive: My second favorite on the album, I love this song, the melodies and the lyrics are great, the part of \\"every night I hear you scream\\" is awesome, so is the guitar and the chorus, \\"I'm no stranger to this place\\", I love this song too. 10/10 <br /> <br />10.A Bell Will Ring: Is good, it has good lyrics and guitars, but nothing else, I like it anyway. 8/10 <br /> <br />11.Let There Be Love: I don't like it as much as the rest of the people, is not bad, but it could be better, the lyrics are great, but there's something missing about the music, I hope this song could be a grower so I could like it more in the future. 8/10  <br /> <br />OASIS IS BACK!!!!
1587880784|5.0|This timeless, archetypal tale of mankind's deepest unspoken questions becomes even more powerful when read aloud.  Clarke's words sear into your brain, sometimes spellbinding you, sometimes terrifying you.  The narrator's vocal pitch and pace neatly embellish the story's ever-rising emotions.<br /><br />A great bonus:  Almost the entire first disk is filled with Arthur C. Clarke himself discussing the composition of 2001, his collaboration with Stanley Kubrick, and the parallels between fact and fiction he has witnessed in the years since 1968.<br /><br />I unreservedly recommend this audio CD (6 discs).
0783233477|5.0|This film was out for awhile before I had the opportunity to see it.  I immediately watched it a second time, knowing I had missed important dialogue, etc. and needed to go over it again.  Brad Pitt is phenomenal in his dual role as perspective boyfriend and Death.  The whole cast is perfect for their parts.  What a wonderful yet heartbreaking yet uplifting yet lovable yet sad (and I could go on) film.  Yes, this film completely engrosses you in so many feelings all at the same time that it is hard to explain just how it does make you feel.  I do know you want Death to be a winner and what does that mean????  At the same time, you can't stand to think that the boyfriend may not get his chance at life and love if Death does win.  I watch this film frequently and am never bored with it.  I LOVE IT!!!   I read some other reviews here that found no merit in this film whatsoever.  I can't remotely relate to this particular type of opinion.  Where has the romance gone for some people?  Actually, they don't know what they are missing, do they?     <br />
1577311523|5.0|This book has it all.  Finally the end of the search for enlightenment.  After 30 years of meditation, diets, asanas, pranayama, etc etc this book allows me to see that what I have been searching for all my life, I already have.  I kept looking for an acid trip or something to let me know I had arrived, but that is NOT what it is.  I could have saved thousands of dollars.  I am no longer a seeker, but a finder.  YEA!!!!   <br /> <br />Now I reread this book just to get a smile.  Brilliant work.
B0008ISM40|4.0|Love Trent. Own almost all the halos, including With Teeth dvd dual disc and the single The Hand That Feeds. It took me a few good listens before I could appreciate With Teeth, and now it has a permanent place in my cd player. Not the best NiN record, but very worthy to mention. Fo anyone who doesn't know Nine Inch Nails, this, The Downward Spiral, Pretty Hate Machine, Broken and the Fragile are pretty much the best things to come out. The other 13 halos are irrelevant unless you are hardcore, comme moi.<br />But please be warned, the dvd-dual disc comes with anti-piracy warnings and you will not be able to copy it onto your computer. I have all my music on my computer, so to not have this awesome cd is really annoying. I realize this is to protect the artist, but it really blows not to be able to add my favorite tracks to my mp3 player.
B0009IOR6Q|2.0|This film pails in comparison to the greats like Polyester, Desperate Living and Female Trouble. Classic example of Waters playing to the mainstream and losing his fans in the process.<br /><br />Still, the film does have some good merits like Rikki Lake and the ugly girl, and is definitely a million times better than Cecil B. Demented.
B000000OAN|5.0|As Roger Taylor says, Queen were heavily on the rise when their breakthrough sensation A Night At The Opera was released. They had already scored a fairly big hit with the song Killer Queen on the Sheer Heart Attack album, and were quickly garnishing attention. This achievement, not only features arguably the greatest operatic composition ever recorded, but also displays exceptional musicality, witty sing-a-long songs, art rock, smashing guitar riffs, and pop beauty.<br /><br />The album begins with easily one of Queen's hardest rocking songs of all time, Death On Two Legs pounds vicious chords on you, and then Mercury shouts bloody lyrics into our ears, with the song compiled with some extraordinary metal rock. The album then takes a lighter approach with Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon, offering a calm, almost laughable lyrical delivery, with a smooth finishing guitar solo. Roger Taylor finds his best rock composition up to this point with I'm In Love With My Car, a lyrically strong, well composed hard rocker. The pop beauty I mentioned in the first paragraph comes with You're My Best Friend, a pop ballad with a smooth intro, and a catchy chorus, all in all a very pleasant song. 39' is very much so folk oriented, with a smooth guitar strum, and Brian May providing the lyrics. Sweet Lady is a much different approach to rock n' roll than Queen's typical rock compositions. It has strong riffs, with a good lyrical delivery from Freddie. However, it isn't a very well written composition. Seaside Rendezvous has a very flamboyant feel to it, obviously influenced by Mercury's homosexuality. This in no way takes away from the brilliance of the song, with great piano rolls, and enjoyable overdubs and background harmonies. An operatic powerhouse comes next with Prophet's Song, an 8 minute extraordinaire, with sensational crescendos and it's many different rock phases. Love Of My Life is very much so a live track, with fulfilled beauty coming from the original recording as well. A very passionate recording with Mercury delivering maybe one of his greatest lyrics of any Queen recording. The guitar strum is simple, but nice. Good Company may be the weakest recording on the track list, with a lack in melody. Bohemian Rhapsody then comes on. A highly definitive recording, I find the most impressive component to this song are the different phases it runs through. Lyrically, it is outstanding, and few recordings ever matched the true magnificence it possessed, incorporating overdubs into the song with perfection. The piano melody is sensational and catchy. The song is highly driven by Mercury's lyrical delivery though, passionately singing \\"Mama just killed a man...\\". The rock section of this song is extraordinary, and a classic guitar solo, actually thought up by Mercury could not be without. Of course the operatic section is a force, with the overdubs and back and forth lyrics simply exceptional. The song ends on a soothing return to the core of the song, and Mercury singing in a poetic tone. To follow, a nice rendition of God Save The Queen, almost a bow for the album accomplishment. Possibly in buying the remastered version of this album with two useless remixes in some ways takes away from listening to the album as a whole closing with God Save The Queen.<br /><br />A Night At The Opera highly expresses in many ways why Queen's true decade was the 70s, in which they explored many different fields of music with artistic experimentation. It is in many ways a disgrace to the achievements of Queen to read Rolling Stone's thoughts on this band, giving it no respect, and not even placing this work of art on their list of 500 greatest albums of all time. Quite possibly the most misunderstood group of all time, Queen's A Night At The Opera one of a few of their rock masterpieces that is more than essential for a Queen fan, and should be looked into for all music listeners. Other Queen selections I recommend include A Day At The Races, Sheer Heart Attack, Queen I, Queen II, Greatest Hits albums, The Game and News Of The World.Queen II, Greatest Hits albums, The Game and News Of The World.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|i  love the music style of radiohead, but their songs for me always sounded too incoherent and formless, theres wasnt a spicific song i could nail as a favorite and their lyrics seemed to be made exclusively for their lead singer to understand, the music muse dishes out in this album sound more alive (even though similar to the style of radiohead, and a touch of queen) and captivating then radiohead ever did.....now many of you can beg to differ as much as you please, you can write 400 pages essays about why you hate muse and why radiohead is the real deal, you can spend as many hrs tring to explain yourself as you want, but in the end result it basically all comes down to this........i like their music, and i like their music  more then radioheads.....and i believe there are many others that feel the same way too, radiohead had a great sound, and muse made better use of it.....
B00005JNTZ|5.0|Incredibly intricate plotting, witty, original writing, and unbelieveably talented acting....just a few reasons why this show is so great. Kristin Bell is absolutely incandescent as a teenage girl who, in the course of a year, is dumped by her first love w/ no explanation, loses a best friend (murdered), her sheriff father is removed from office, shunned by her peers, and is abandoned by her alcoholic mother. Oh, and she woke up one morning after a party, having lost her virginity and no memory of how it occurred. Revenge, finding out the truth, and reuniting her family are her new priorities. Rather different from most teenage girls. The story is told from her perspective and follows her search for the truth and the growth that occurs along the way. Not to mention when she finally finds it and deals with it. <br /> <br />The characters are given depth and layers to their personality. Gradually, some are peeled back so we the audience begin to understand their motivations and actions. No one is quite what they seem. The writers and actors are to be commended on their creation of original, fascinating, yet believeable, characters. Jason Dohring's portrayal of Logan, in particular, has progressed through the transformation from an \\"obligatory psychotic jackass\\" to a troubled, but ultimately decent person. One whose motivations we can understand and sympathize with. <br /> <br />The pacing of the mystery is outstanding. This is not one of those shows that leaves you frustrated b/c it drags out the mystery and tension so thin, you're feel cheated, or worse, bored by the time the final reveal happens. No, Veronica Mars (S1) gives you a tantalizing glimpse of the truth in each episode, before revealing all in the thrilling final two episodes. Although the season does end on a mini-cliffhanger, I was more than satisfied with the resolution of the major mysteries presented by the pilot episode.  <br /> <br />So if you like film noir, or good teenage dramas, or sharp, wittydialogue, or good mysteries where things are unexpected yet ring true, or amazing acting, or just good story-telling, Veronica Mars delivers. A truly excellent show.
4789009637|5.0|Though I cannot confirm whether this is the workbook or textbook, I can still give my opinion. This is the exact same series used in my Japanese classes. It is easy to understand, gives ample explanation and example, and follows a logical course. My Japanese teacher, who happens to be Japanese herself, likes this book far better than the other ones she has tried. This is a book for anyone who is interested in the Japanese language or just beginning to learn.
B000078DOI|4.0|Along with the Beastie Boys and Anthrax, this west coast quartet --the original line-up comprised of the two permanent members Anthony Kiedis (vox.) and Michael Balzary/Flea (bass) as well as lead guitarist the late Hillel Slovak and Jack Irons on drums who were replaced by John Frusciante and Chad Smith respectively which, except for a brief dalliance with Jane's Addiction lead guitarist, Dave Navarro, while Frusciante was detoxing from heroin dependence is the line-up at present-- deserves credit for the willful cross-pollenating of previously rigidly defined and hyper-compartmentalized musical styles that which in the mid-'80's was a no-no bordering on sacrilidge.  For those like myself whose middle and high school years straddled this period, rock, pop, punk. rap/hip-hop, funk reggae/ska and jazz devotees were in clearly defined sub-cultures that segregated themselves from one another, creating a climate which had little tolleration for those free radicals in the system who saw the merits in Led Zeppelin, George Clinton/Parliament-Funkadelic, Black Flag, Run-D.M.C., Metallica, The Cure, Sly & the Family Stone and Miles Davis simulaneously.  Emerging in the early-'80's while the mainstream music culture was still in the grips of the hyper-compartmentalization that I previously mentioned, The Red Hot Chili Peppers took the bold step of combining the various musical styles they loved with equal zeal with a damn-the-torpedoes attitude as to whether or not the public would embrace them and their then-unique sound.  They were indeed helped by the now-legendary stage gimmick of playing clad only in kneehigh tube socks worn over their respective genitals.  Their sense of humor showed they didn't take themselvews seriosly and this contributed to their growing popularity.  Their first album was actually recorded with different personnel on guitar and drums when Hillel and Jack decided they wanted to explore another group but returned for the tour when those plans didnt work out.  Freakey-Styley, their 2nd album and a better one, followed their self-titled debut, but they hit their full stride upon the relaese of their 3rd one, Uplift Mofo party Plan, the last one Hillel would contribute to due to a heroin overdose, a death which had a profound effect on the psyches of the remaining members, ultimately leading to Jack Irons exit from the band.  Kiedis --who, in spite of the loss of his close friend, was in the grips of his own back and forth battle with heroin addiction-- and Flea decided to soldier on and, with the addition of John and Chad, commenced recording their next record, 1989's Mother's Milk featuring a cover of Stevie Wonder's funk classic, Higher Ground, and a tribute to Hillel Slovak, Knock Me Down.  Most bands don't do well after the loss of one or more crucial members, but RHCP replaced one amazingly talented guitarist with another who was arguably better where most bands are lucky to find merely competent substitues; however, they were able to retain and even expand that magic chemistry they had had with the original guitarist and drummer when Frusciante and Smith came on board.  Their 5th album and sophmore effort with the new line-up, Blood-Sugar-Sex-Magic saw the Peps at the height of their talents, but Milk was a good preview of what was to come.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|thius album is crazy its really diffrent than there other albums but its great the song styles really change troughout the whole album and the lyrics are weirb but its an amazing album and when i first heard i thought it was really diffrent and weird and i kinda liked it but after listening to the songs more and more its amazing and i recommend that anyone who likes system of a down go out and get this album
068987474X|1.0|A friend of mine raved about this book, so in spite of the put-down title (which I think generalizes men, and women), I picked up a copy.  And yes, was disappointed. The book focuses on excuses women make to convince themselves that men are \\"into them\\" when they're \\"not.\\" First, I thought the points were obvious - for example, a man who doesn't call when he says he would. According to the book, if he doesn't, he's not into you.  There could be a multitude of reasons why that aren't related to how into you he is or isn't. But that being said, the reasons may not matter. For the more appropriate question in my view is \\"How do you want to be treated in a relationship?\\"  To instead ask whether or not \\"he's into you\\" is to assume that he's finding you lacking in some way. Yes, the book says you're great, pretty, etc. but if the authors really believe that, then why all the repetition of the only reason a guy isn't acting like Prince Charming is that you don't interest him enough (with the token positive comment added on after all the negativity)?    I don't think many women would want to be involved with or marry a man who treated them well only because he was \\"into her\\" and had treated other women poorly because he wasn't into them. Not me anyway - only a man who treats all women and men well is worth it, in my book.    Second, this book doesn't match my personal experience either - of a couple of men who'd told me they'd been too nervous to ask me out for a very long time, of the male friends who'd told me they'd been so broken by their previous relationships that they feared getting into another one (and I witnessed their hesitation for years - and yes - the women they married did a lot of the work in the beginning), of the  men I know who have told me that they often \\"reject before being rejected\\" etc.    So what's of value here? Deciding what kind of relationship you want and seeking someone who treats you well (and hopefully because of who he is as a person, not his evaluation of you).    But there are plenty of books out there written by people who possess and offer much deeper knowledge of relationships than the writers of this book, and who offer it in a way that is affirming, rather than negative. One title that goes to the heart of relationships in a positive and clear way is \\"The New Couple,\\" by Maurice Taylor and Seana McGee. A book written for men by a psychologist (also a man) but that I think many women would find very helpful is \\"When Good Men Behave Badly\\" by David Wexler (yes, another cliche title - and possibly one that's off-putting to men[!] - but the content of the book is solid, deep and respectful of people. I've found it countless times more helpful than this one). On a more general level, Don Miguel Ruiz's books - \\"The Four Agreements,\\" \\"The Mastery of Love\\" and \\"The Voice of Knowledge\\" are helpful reminders of all the \\"stories\\" that are told in our culture (like those in this book) - and how they distort reality and how damaging they can be to our healthy and happy functioning.     In questions of relationship, I think it's good to turn towards people who have knowledge (psychologists for example) and write with maturity in this area. The content of this particular book stays on the surface of the things, and I think is presented in a unnecessarily negative manner. Not something I'd recommend to anyone, and I'm concerned about all the hype over this one - for I think it can steer we women in an unhealthy direction, where we ask the wrong question -   \\"Is he into me?\\"  - rather than \\"What do I want in my relationship?\\"
B0001NBMBC|3.0|The album isn't as good as the the first album and 2nd one IOWA.....they didn't had barely any swearing in it.....it looks like that band is running out of ideas as far as lyrics is concern but the melody is good although.....but it isn't bad for a main stream band although, I'm not really into bands that's play on the radio that you hear every where you go. <br /> <br /> Only some main stream bands I like besides slipknot...is system of a down, mariyan manson, nine inch nails, ozzy osburne, black sabbath....that's it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Godsmack is hard rock not metal.
B0002858YS|4.0|now i bought this album because... well i dont know i did and i hated it the first time i listened to it and wanted to trade it to my friend for a danzig album but after listening to it is was  really good i was surprised and yes mr.brightside and somebody told me are overplayed and probeley the worset songs on the album but its good and the best song in my opinion is \\"midnight show\\" and what you have to listen to in the album is the music because the lyrics are wierd and unusual but its really a good album and you should buy it
B00005QDW5|5.0|This echoes, double cd is worth the money, but if you already own almost all pink floyd CD's then don't bother with this. <br /> <br /> <br /> The only down fall with this is that there's 2 good songs they didn't put on either of those CD's which is DOGS OF WAR and ONE SLIP. But other than that I have nothing to complain bout it.
B0006213WG|4.0|now iv'e been listening to sum-41 for a while now and though there first two albums Half Hour Of Power and All Killer No Filler were alternative and Does This Look Infected was leaning twords harder rock and Chuck obviosley was metal with the exception of some songs Chuck is still a good album and would recommend it to sum-41 fans but the olny thing that bothers me is the looping of the high hats in the chours of \\"open your eyes\\"
0385335482|4.0|I just finished reading Confessions of a Shopaholic by Sophie Kinsella.  I absolutely loved it.  While I will admit that it did start off rather slow, it definitely picks up in the middle-->end.  I saw so much of myself in the main character, Becky Bloomwood, and would highly reccommend this book to any of my girlfriends, or to fellow shopaholics.  I was able to relate to her character as she endured one financial woe after another.  I too have a weakness for shopping!  Overall I really enjoyed this book and reccommend it for others.
B000002UAU|5.0|I love this album but...i think Abbey Road,White album and Revolver is even better.  <br /> <br />The guitarr solo on the first song...is made by Mccartney. He are also doing the guitar solo on Good Morning Good Morning and Fixing a Hole.
B0000019PA|3.0|I bought this on the strength of other reviewers' hyperbole. And while I won't say that it was money entirely wasted - on the contrary, it is a quirky and likeable concoction, sort of Richard & Linda Thompson (circa 'I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight') spliced with mid-period Mercury Rev; an unusual pop experience - nevertheless, my universe is emphatically NOT turned on its head. Buy and enjoy...but let's keep things in perspective.
B000929AJQ|2.0|I am a huge fan of NIN and always will be.  I have to admit that i am very disappointed in this album, no matter what.  They are all weak songs, nothing new. I can even say that there are no favourite tracks in this album.  Most of them was constructed from the old materials.  As i said i will always be NIN fan so i will look for the next album. I am sure they will come back in top form with the album more creative, more structure and hope that trent will co-produce with Flood again !!
B000002UZ4|5.0|i made a bet with someone who didn't believe me that the pet shop boys did a cover of \\"where the streets have no name.\\"  i won, of course, and now the guy owes me a beer.  i give this album five stars for the free beer it won me.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is one of the best, if not the best album have ever bought. Packed full of emotion and originality it is definately an essential album of the 90's, and an essential album to brit pop. Highlights include: Paranoid Android, Exit Music, Let Down, Karma Police, Climbing up the walls and No Surprises. In my opinion it is the best Radiohead album in existence, and probably nothing they release in the future will live up to it.
038533348X|3.0|This book wasn't bad, but it seemed a bit lacking. I don't know. Call me a Philistine, but it didn't really have much in the neighborhood of character development. Or conflict. Or most of the elements of a story, for that matter.  <br /> <br />Granted, it was an entertaining read, and I can see a smile on Vonnegut's face upon reading this. He would probably look at me and say, \\"Cat's Cradle.\\" Was that the point? Was I supposed to come out of it with a nihilistic outlook? The story was short, simple, and it lacked depth. I found it lacking.  <br /> <br />Read it if you like, or don't. I don't see anything particularly compelling about it, and I am enjoying my new book much more. <br />Harkius
B000002H97|5.0|As soon as I popped this cd in and heard the intro for Enter Sandman I knew I loved this cd. As I continued to listen I realized this wasn't even the best song on the album. The best song, in my opinion is Wherever I may Roam, because of the cool intro, where it steadily gets heavier and faster, and the 2 minute solo at the end. Of Wolf and Man is another great one. Basically it's a song about a werewolf. You can understand why it's heavy? I don't normally rate each song seperately, but for this album i've got to make an exception.    First I have to add, all the songs have amazing intros    1) Enter Sandman- Great lyrics, I like the riff a lot 9/10  2) Sad But True- One of best intros all time, heavy till the end 8/10  3) Holier Than Thou- Not a good follow up to Sad But True (You have to listen to it to know what i mean), it's not as heavy and sounds quieter, probably my least favorite song on the cd 5/10  4) The Unforgiven- A good change of pace from the previous three songs it fits perfectly in it's place on the cd, though the lyrics are...different you could say 9/10  5) Wherever I May Roam- My favorite song on the cd, though Of Wolf and Man and The God That Failed both come close, best intro to any Metallica song, lyrics fit well with the music, this is a totally kick @$$ song 10/10  6) Don't Tread On Me- Very different sounding compared to the rest of the cd but not in a bad way, a good follow up to Roam. 8/10  7) Through The Never- The only song besides Holier Than Thou I didn't like much, I'm not sure why 6/10  8) Nothing Else Matters- This shows how Metallica can make a slow song that still thrashes, great solo towards the end 9/10  9) Of Wolf and Man- Great song, fast and heavy, sweet intro, I don't see why Metallica needed to write about werewolves, but then why the hell not? 10/10  10) The God That Failed- About James' mother dying, that explains why it's heavy, this one is 5 minutes 18 seconds of pure madness 10/10  11) My Friend of Misery- This one isgood but I feel like they made it too long, it's got a good solo 7.5/10  12) The Struggle Within- Nice short thrashing closer, cool intro awesome drums 8/10    I have to give Lars some credit, his drums rock hard in this one, James' vocals are great, the guitars are better than some of their other albums, but the bass is missing something RIP Clif, well...all I can say is this album kicks @$$!!!!!
0143034901|5.0|For the first time ever, I have discovered a book that impacted me in a new way. I have read plenty of books good enough that I couldn't put them down. Eyes of the Dragon immediately leaps to mind, which is why I no longer start it on a weeknight.<br /><br />But, until now, I have never read a novel so good that I periodically had to close the book, put it down, and walk away. I can see the reason for the complaints by some of the reviewers. At times, yes, it is a bit melodramatic. However, the entire piece has a feeling of hyperreality. So real that it FEELS artificial. This is a feeling only a few books have given me, and none of them were the hack-and-slash neo-modern kitsch that goes by the term \\"cyberpunk.\\" Bear v. Shark was the other truly appropriate example.<br /><br />This book had everything that Cat's Cradle (another I read recently) did not. Adequate character development, a compelling storyline, dramatic conflict, etc. Y'know...the elements of fiction. This was a tremendously good book, and I can see why it is on the Spanish bestseller list, and why it has been for three years.<br /><br />A great book. Read it, share it, pass it on. Put it down and walk away, though, because sometimes...it seems like the author is sitting in a chair, whispering in your ear. And that, my friend, is not a terribly good feeling late at night when you expect to be all alone. Loved it!<br /><br />Harkius
0440241413|5.0|Confessions of a Shopaholic is such a funny book!  I was sucked into this book because I love to shop and the more expensive and rare an item is the more I love it...so I loved the shopping references, the romance, and the pure sense that she is human in her feelings and actions.  I was soaked in this book and laughed out loud at many parts, most of the time being so entranced in the book, that I didn't realize I was laughing until someone kindly let me know.  I can't wait to start the second book and see where Becky ends up in her shopping travels.  If you are looking for a fun and lighthearted book this book is an excellent read!  I recommend it purely for the way you will be able to become Becky as you read.  Check this book out!
B00097A5I6|4.0|Big Oasis fans want another Morning Glory or Definitely Maybe. We want Oasis to pull an American Idiot. That's not going to happen. Was Noel's sublime talent fried on coke in 1995? Can a great band keep its spark while flicking away founding members like fingernail clippings? Who knows? But everyone should know that Don't Believe the Truth is first Oasis studio album worth the money in a long time. <br />The first five tracks are all good. Turn Up the Sun and Love Like a Bomb are solid songs with Liam sneering in sincerity. They feature gorgeous piano and guitar interludes that will be missed on most sample sound clips. The growing strength of Noel Gallagher's voice is perhaps the best reason for sticking with Oasis after their peak. His singing, in The Importance of Being Idle and especially Part of the Queue, has a clarity and a lovely high range that is completely different but sometimes rivaling his brother's. The guitars on the album show that Noel can still write rock songs. And it seems Liam and bass player Andy Bell can too; it's difficult sometimes to tell which are Noel's.   The guitar solos don't have the audacity of Champagne Supernova, but the stripped down Meaning of Soul is infectious while Noel's solos in Keep the Dream Alive are as soaring and epic as anything from the band's peak years. <br />Don't Believe the Truth is a very good album, perhaps because its ambitions are not bloated with the sorts of excess a band as big as Oasis (I know, I know, and I meant in Britain and much of the rest of the world, not the U.S.) could easily indulge in. There's a reason Coldplay and the Killers love this band: Ten years ago they were the best and they're still important today.  This album was made by men in their thirties who own their tremendous pasts. With Don't Believe the Truth, Oasis's future looks good too.  <br />
B000002UAU|5.0|This album really does sound overrated. I thought that before I heard it. I am a 15 year old male that has discovered old music. It is WAY better. There are two bands that have stuck out for me as the best bands of all time. The first is Led Zeppelin. The second is..... <br /> <br />THE BEATLES! <br /> <br />This is their first concept album and MAYBE the first concept album. (I can't remember). Either way it's a true work of art. It's also the first Beatles album I got. (I got the compilation \\"1\\" first). I am going to \\"grade\\",if you may, each song out of ten. It will mainly be based of relativity to the rest of the album. Most of the songs would get tens otherwise. <br /> <br />\\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" <br />7/10 This song is very cool. Especially the solo at the beginning. That George is a VERY careful, gentle soloer and it makes him amazing. <br /> <br />\\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" <br />9/10 This song is very pretty. Ringo's voice makes it softer. <br /> <br />\\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" <br />10/10 Very pretty and poetic. Then a rockin anthem.... <br /> <br />\\"Getting Better\\" <br />8/10 Very pretty chorus. The rest isnt so pretty. Paul song. (Most of Paul's are pretty, like Blackbird) <br /> <br />\\"Fixing A Hole\\" <br />6/10 This song is very cool and fun to sing along with. <br /> <br />\\"She's Leaving Home\\" <br />8/10 This song is like a ballad. It is very pretty. It makes you feel out of this world. Quite distant. I think the harp causes that. <br /> <br />\\"Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" <br />9/10 This is like a fun circus song. Very experimental. <br /> <br />\\"Within You Without You\\" <br />5/10 George's only song on the album. It's Indian. My only complaint is it's to long for only one chord (you heard me, one chord). <br /> <br />\\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" <br />8/10 The sing-along song of the album. <br /> <br />\\"Lovely Rita\\" <br />9/10 It's a really cool song. I can't describe it. Your just gonna have to listen. <br /> <br />\\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" <br />4/10 The least memorable song on the album features Pet Sounds! (haha a rock music pun). <br /> <br />\\"Sgt. Pepper's... (Reprise)\\" <br />9/10 Better thanb the first version. More upbeat. Gets you singing. <br /> <br />\\"A Day In The Life\\" <br />10/10 Not only the best song on the album, possibly the Beatles' best song. <br /> <br />All in all, quite an amazing album. I think everyone should buy this, but not before RUBBER SOUL and REVOLVER, because they lead from beatlemania to this.
B00002Z88D|5.0|How did Metallica sell out when this concert took place. This was one of those shows that was destined to take place. The band never sounded better and with symphony it just added to the songs. I love the intro to Master of Puppets. The only complaint i have about the cd is the fact that Unforgiven, Fade to Black, and Sanitarium are not here. If you are a true Metallica fan or want something brand new that will blow you away, pick up this cd. It is one of my top favorite albums of all time.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Oner of the better adaptations of a play I can recall with outstanding dialogue great acting and the intrigue of who's next?  Will we stay together? Does she really love him?  Can I trust her/him?  My take on the film is that we adults in Western society seem persistently uncertain about whether we are happy or not, whether the other guy is happier, whether I might be happier with another woman: in short,  how can I have my pussy and eat it too.  Into London flys Natalie Portman, something of a free spirit, something of an innocent in so far as she loves and when loves goes she walks, or flys, to some, a rather infantile notion as \\"romantic love\\" may have been transformed iknto something else, something deeper. She brings a certain dynamic into the lives of three locals - a photographer, a writer and a doctor., and at the end she returns to the States. Two characters have found a deeper meaning to their relationship and one is left staring at a wall on his way to work to write obituaries. Pretty much rivetting from beginning to end.  I loved it.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Some have said the 30th anniversary edition of Jaws is a waste of money, especially if you purchased the 25th anniversary volume.  Well, I did buy the 25th anniversary edition, but I'll gladly shell out more money for more special features on a DVD of a movie I love.  It's a matter of personal choice.  Debate the value of the film itself if you will, but it seems pointless to mention that the studios might be picking our pockets.  We can all decide that for ourselves.
0784011176|3.0|This movie may has absolutely not any problems. actings are brilliant, directing is brilliant, but I didn't like the scenario at all, first half of the movie was terribly boring and the second half was better but still boring. this movie was not based on a true story so Jane Campion could wrote a much more exciting scenario. even some heavy nudity scenes couldn't help it! I can't say this was a bad movie. but I didn't like it. It's only worth to buy for an  oscar or any prize winner movies collector and worth to rent for a critic but, for ordinary costumers, I suggest to wait and watch it from TV, cause it's rather an old movie and some channels may show it occasionally!
0783225881|5.0|You may not feel it as you read this review.  You may not believe it when you hear someone tell this story.  But watch this film.  All of it, beginning to end.  This is the greatest film ever made. <br /> <br />Not for special effects.  Not for production values.  Heart.  Imagination.  Emotions stirred that transcend this world.  If you've seen Field of Dreams, you know exactly what I'm talking about. <br /> <br />This is the greatest motion picture of all time.  It won't be recognized as such.  And that doesn't matter.   <br /> <br />Do one thing.  Show this to your grandchildren.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|It's diffinately one of the best tom cruise performances I've ever seen. also not forget about jamie foxx as a cab driver. and the atmosphere of the movie, city at night. It was wonderful and it's one of the movies that I can occasionally watch several times without getting bored. let's forget about some scenario problems, but yes, I'm agree with that there were some problems! falling the first victim on the roof of the cab was not a possitive point for a professional assasin. also leaving that imoprtant bag in the cab and getting it back by killing the thievs was rather qustionable! and several same problems... but I can close my eyese to them and say that it was a brilliant movie. <br />Let's have some words about DVD release too. I think they could release it as a single disc special edition DVD cause it has not that much special features for a two disc edition. but release it as a two disc special edition and with a good price & DTS audio track, tantalizing every person not only collector's to buy it! everybody knows that a two disc special edition is more exciting than a single disc even if there is not much on disc 2. thanks to the studio for a good DVD release!
B00097A5I6|4.0|There's been a lot of talk that this is the third best Oasis album (after DM and WTSMG, of course). I know what they mean; none of the songs on this album approach the headiness of \\"Live Forever\\", \\"Supersonic\\", \\"Don't Look Back...\\", or any of the other standouts from their first two albums, so it's hard for this album to measure up. <br />I do believe that this is the most even Oasis album from start to finish, however. There aren't any obvious thowaways/clunkers and I've found myself wanting to go back and listen to the ENTIRE album over and over. It's hard to name a favorite track or weakest track right now. Overall solid album.
B0001CNRB6|5.0|it was diffinately one of the best romace comedy movies I've ever seen. It grabbed me from the beginning and many many funny scenes came ahead. I watched it first time alone and several times with others. It's a big deal of fun and a great timeless movie that suitable to watch with your fiance or girl friend. Althogh it's a single layer simple DVD, it's worth at any price. But if you decided to buy it let me inform you that, there is a boxed set named \\"ROCK HUDSON & DORIS DAY ROMANCE COLLECTION\\". It's consist of 3 Romance comedy movies starring Rock Hudson and Doris Day togheter and this movie is one of them. this pack is available in Amazon.com in a great price of approx 20 dollars. I strongly suggest you to buy it cause you can watch it a lifetime!
B00097A5I6|4.0|Everyone always says \\"there's no Live Forever or Wonderwall\\" on this ablum when talking about any album that came after Definitely Maybe and What's the Story (Morning Glory)?  The 'new-ness' of Oasis is gone.  No matter how good of a song they cmoe out with, it will never be as big because they've been around for a decade, so just sit back and enjoy the music.  Stop praying to god for that next Supersonic.<br /><br />The album starts off with Turn Up the Sun.  Turn Up the Sun starts off with a melancholy guitar melody which leads up to that Oasis swagger that we all know.  Liam's delivery on this is as confident and in-your-face as Liam gets.  The hook is very catchy as well.  If you're not tapping your foot or bobbing your head to this song, check your pulse because you're dead.<br /><br />The second song is Mucky Finger, which is sung by Noel.  It has a driving drum beat, which you'll either love or hate.  This little song is fun.  Sounds influenced by Bob Dylan.  The harmonica solo is smoking!<br /><br />Lyla is the third track and the first single off of the album.  Turn Up the Sun was supposed to be, but Sony wouldnt allow it because Noel didnt write it.  Part of the Queue was thought of as a first single, but Noel sings that and Liam didn't want people to think he left the band.  Anyways, the first listen to Lyla, you'll probably think to yourself \\"meh.\\"  But let me tell you, it grows on you.  It grows A LOT and you'll find yourself repeating the track over and over.  The verses are almost hypnotizing.  If you're not singing along, check your pulse again.  You just might be dead.<br /><br />Love like a Bomb is the Songbird on this album.  Its Liam singing with an acoustic and minimal percussion.  Its catchy and sincere.  There's a really cool breakdown in the middle of the song that leads back into the regular song again with a nice little piano solo(ish thing) and then back into the chorus.  Its a pretty song.<br /><br />The Importance of Being Idle starts off with some march-like drums.  Noel sings and his voice all over the place.  Its not exactly a happy song, but if you're feeling a little down, this thing is great to sing along with.  It gives the message that even if everything seems to be going wrong, there's always something positive, even if its just the stars at night.<br /><br />The Meaning of Soul is a fast-pace, two chord song.  Its boisterous and full of confidence.  The chorus is very catchy.  The song is short and sweet.  Its a great song for when you just get off of a long day's worth of work and you want to rock out in your car on the way home.  The harmonica solo in here almost sounds like a guitar solo; Gem did a great job on that.<br /><br />Guess God Thinks I'm Abel slowly builds from minimal and soft to very moving and loud (even if its only for a few seconds).  Its a nice relaxing, sincere song.<br /><br />Part of the Queue is another song sung by Noel.  Everything about this song is great.  His delivery is very very strong.  The guitars are catchy and the bass moves around making the harmonies great.  Zak's drumming is spot on, which is true for this whole album.  This is definitely one of the best on the album.<br /><br />Keep the Dream Alive a very optimistic song (as you can tell by the title).  It builds slowly from beginning to end.  The chorus is very anthemic.  This is lovely song.<br /><br />A Bell Will Ring is many people's (including Ringo Starr) favorite song on the CD.  It starts of with Gem doing a nice guitar riff, then Liam comes in doing what he does best.  It then starts that oh-so familiar Oasis swagger that we're so used and have only heard for the third time on the album (which isn't bad or good, i'm just stating).  This song is a feel good rocker.  gotta love it!<br /><br />Let There Be Love is a song that most people love and not know why.  It's Gem's favorite on the album, and he has no clue why.  Noel didn't even want it on the album.  I find it be somewhat a mixture of Idler's Dream and Stop Crying Your Heart Out.  Its a lovely ballad (which is why Noel didn't want it on the CD).  It starts off with just a piano and guitar, then Liam starts singing very sincerely.  Its very pretty.  Then it picks up a little bit with strings, drums, and bass and Noel takes over with the song changing a bit.  It goes from a maudlin tone to more of a completely optimistic feel, then it breaks back down into what it was in the beginning: just a piano, acoustic guitar, and Liam singing the first verses again.  This time the strings et al join in with Liam as he sings the chorus one last time, then breaks down at the end and has a little electric piano solo(ish) thing.  I must admit that it may be my song on this album.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: I love this album, and i'm not saying it because its still rather new.  When I got Heathen Chemistry, I said to myself \\"wow, this has about 5 or 6 great tunes, 3 decent ones and the rest is crap.\\"  This album, on the other hand, is what i think to be Oasis' Rubber Soul Album.  There aren't any huge songs on here, but thats not to say that there aren't great songs that just wont happen to become huge.  I think this is Oasis' most solid album.  I loved Definitely Maybe, but there were some songs that I just didn't listen to (although its still my favorite Oasis album).  Opposed to what everyone else liked, I didn't care too much for Morning Glory.  I thought half of it was good and the other half was okay.  Be Here Now was solid.  A couple great songs, a lot of okay songs, and a little bit of crap.  Standing on the shoulder of Giants was very good, I thought.  As I said before, HC was good, but had a lot of filler.  Don't Believe the Truth honestly doesnt have a bad song.  Just like all cds it does have songs that are better than others, but that's not to say any of them are bad.  It may not have your beloved Live Forever, but I promise you that it doesn't have that All Around the World (Reprise).omewhat a mixture of Idler's Dream and Stop Crying Your Heart Out.

B000957O82|5.0|Hitch is a great movie, hands down.  Will Smith was born to play Hitch.  This movie is very funny and uplifting, you wont be disapointed.  I highly recommend Hitch!!!
B000001G16|5.0|I'm not sure how I ever founf this album, Guess it was dumbluck but thank god I did. It is truely amazing. his talent is a huge reason for the huge sucess of bon jovi. The best tracks are \\"Father time\\" witch you can feel the emotion in his voice and \\"the answer\\" is another amasing track that realy makes you think. you just can't go wroug with this one.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Absolutely one of the best death bands out here today people, make an effort to buy this album after you've read this, just totally brutal, head busting, kick-u-in-the-balls-and-die metal, can't get any better. <br />I recomend this album to any fan of authentic death metal! <br /> <br />BUY IT TODAY, I GUARANTEE YOU NO DISAPOINTMENTS!
0792840461|1.0|The Thomas Crown Affair exhibits all the worst excesses of late '60s filmmaking.  From the annoying, omnipresent theme (\\"Windmills of Your Mind\\") to Faye Dunaway's bizarre hairdos, Barbie doll wardrobe, white eyeshadow and false eyelashes, to the pointlessly \\"mod\\" directorial quirks of Norman Jewison (multiple scenes onscreen simultaneously, quick cuts, diffusion, etc.), this is one bad acid trip of a movie.  The plot is slim, and the characters are all remarkably unintelligent for a caper film.  Usually, such films hinge on their characters' extraordinary expertise and/or analytical ability, but that certainly isn't the case here.  For instance, Faye Dunaway's character, a supposedly brilliant insurance investigator, takes one look at a picture of Steve McQueen and announces, \\"That's it!  He's our man!\\"   <br /> <br />Within minutes, Faye and Steve are falling in love.  We know they're falling in love because the film skids to a halt in order to treat us to endless scenes of the two of them playing chess, riding in a dune buggy, haggling over melons in an outdoor market, and sharing the newspaper at breakfast as Michel LeGrand's overheated piano compositions thunder over the soundtrack.  The chess scene in particular is a dilly, close-up after close-up of Faye's shoulder undulating, Steve's eyelids flickering, Faye's finger stroking the oh-so-phallic bishop, Steve's lips quivering, etc. This all takes place over a period of YEARS before somebody finally kisses somebody, at which point the camera - you guessed it! - does not one, not two, but several dizzying 360 sweeps around the osculating couple. <br /> <br />Finally, Faye asks Steve why he robs banks when he is, after all, a zillionaire.  Steve clenches his jaw, then smiles that brief, weary, cynical smile of his and says with a straight face, \\"It's not about the money.  It's the system.  It's me against the system.\\"  Apparently, you could actually say this in 1968 without people exploding into gales of laughter.  Unfortunately for this film, the same cannot be said in 2005.
B000002H33|5.0|this is my second favorite cd of mine from my favorite band (my first being ride the lightning). no weak spots on this one, solid all the way through. great cd, great band, ENOUGH SAID <br /> <br />REST IN PEACE CLIFF
B0007OCG4W|1.0|This film is, quite possibly, the worst film ever. The characters drone about in their own self pity. The film drips of Caucasian sense-of-entitlement. The characters talk because they are all too self-absorbed to act. This film lacks action.
B000002H6C|5.0|first off let me say this is a great cd. this is some really heavy stuff that we're dealing with. its got one of the best metallica songs on it (one). they played this song when i saw them live and the intro was amazing. there were big explosions on stage and they played the battle sounds. it was sooo cool. blinding and deafining but cool. there are no bad songs on this cd. the production is a little weird though so it doesnt sound as smooth as usual but that really doesnt make any difference. this is also the first cd the band made without cliff burton and it is the last cd before metallica went through their big change. (which really isnt wasnt that bad... in my opinion)
B00004THAY|5.0|The CD is just too good.  I end up not listening to other great music.  BB and E.C. together on this album are just addicting!
B000002H2H|5.0|this is the best cd ever by the best band ever. it includes one of my favorite songs of all time in for whom the bell tolls. great classic thrash here. solid all the way through. pretty amazing considering how young they were when they wrote this stuff.  <br />PS  rest in peace cliff <br />
B00079018K|5.0|This is the first album in a long time that I want to buy for all my friends. It hasn't left my car CD player since it was purchased a month or so ago, that is very rare for me...I get bored really easily.
B0007GAERG|5.0|People all I can say is that you need to go ahead a get this album, it's that good..Vocally Mariah outsings most in her sleep, and such heartfelt ballads such as We Belong Together, Joyride, and Mine Again will leave you speechless and begging for more..Get Your Number is a perfect upbeat summer song..But basically the entire album is good and Mariah will have many choices for future singles..Mariah is poised to have the #1 album and #1 song on the charts next week, so she is truly on fire..ps..the review calling Mariah a one hit wonder was simply ignorant.
6304288433|4.0|This  is  the  1981  follow  up  to  the  original  1978  classic .  John  Carpenter  Co  -  writes  ,  Co  -  produces  but  doesn't  direct .  This  film  could  have  been  a  little  better  if  Carpenter  had  decided  to  direct  it .  There  were  rumors  that  Carpenter  did  direct  a  few  scenes  but  Carpenter  has  regularly  denied  the  rumors . Rick  Rosenthal  takes  over  the  reigns  for  this  polished  sequel  and  actually  does  a  pretty  decent  job.  The  film  begins  exactly  where  the  original  ended .  Laurie  (Jamie  Lee  Curtis )  is  rushed  to  the  local  nearby  hospital  for  treament  on  her  wounds  from  the  attack .  Dr.  Loomis  ( Donald  Pleasence ) returns  as  the  psychiatrist  of  the  deranged  killer .  Michael  Myers  is  played  by  ( Dick  Warlock ).  Warlock  follows  Curtis  and  begins  stalking  her  at  the  small  local  hospital  which  is  only  occupied  by  one  security  gaurd  ,  one  doctor  ,  a  few  nurses  including  , Nurse  Jill  ( Tawny  Moyer )  ,  Nurse  Karen  ( Pamela  Susan  Shoop ) and  Nurse  Janet  ( Ana  Alicia ).  There  are  also  a  couple  of  ambulance  workers  Bud  ( Leo  Rossi )  and  Jimmy  ( Lance  Guest ) .  The  atmosphere  of  the  film  is  very  spooky  with  Warlock  roaming  the  halls  of  the  nearly  empty  hospital . Warlock's  first  victim  is  actually  before  his  arrival  at  the  hospital  when  he  Kills  a  teenage  girl    who  lives  close  by  to  the  house  where  Michael  Myers  terrorized  Curtis .  But  at  the  hospital  ,  Warlock  first  knocks  off  the  security  guard . Then   (  Pamela  Susan  Shoop )  is  brutally  drowned  in  the  famous  hot  tub  scene  which  was  rumored  to  have  been  directed  by  John  Carpenter .  Ana  Alicia  while  searching  for  the  only  doctor  available  is  viciously  murdered  by  Warlock  who  is  hiding  in  the  doctor's  office .  Tawny  Moyer  is  murdered  in  another  famous  scene  whereshe  is  lifted  up  off  the  ground  by  Warlock  using  a  scalpel  with  only  one  hand .  The  suspense  really  picks  when  Warlock  and  Curtis  meet  up  towards  the  end  of  the  film .  Dick  Warlock  gives  an  standout  performance .  His  creepy  slow  walk  around  the  hospital  is  eerie .  And  the  song  \\"Mr.  Sandman\\"  sung  by  \\"The  Chordettes\\"  at  the  start  and  end  of  the  film  does  happen  to  fit  very  well  here ! Halloween  II \\"  is  not  as  good  as  the  original  but  how  many  sequels  ever  are  ?  \\" Halloween  II \\"  is  good  and  it's  the  only  sequel  worth  watching  at  all  !!
B000002A46|5.0|Others have tried, but honestly none have ever nailed a holiday album like Mariah...Her version of O Holy Night alone is worth all the money for this album...However Mariah also wrote the hit All I Want For Christmas Is You, which is an all-time classic..Jesus would want it done this way.
1932907009|5.0|At times the universe seems divided into two groups:  those who want to write a movie script, and those who write books and articles telling how. <br />  <br />Blake Snyder, the experienced author of SAVE THE CAT!, falls into both groups -- he's a produced screenwriter, and he's written a nothing-held-back, insider's point-of-view, fabulously funny book about screenwriting. <br />  <br />Using examples of popular movies, Snyder offers sensible advice about creativity, story development using your brain and index cards, how to make the characters do their jobs, and -- best of all, what screenwriters want to know before they even write their screenplays -- how to market your masterpiece. <br />  <br />Every screenwriting instructor (and I don't play one on TV, I am one) should add SAVE THE CAT! to the students' required reading list, without hesitation.  This will be the book they actually read and follow.   <br />  <br />Snyder's writing style is smoother than the sprint to the stage to accept the Academy Award for best original screenplay.  Buy this book.
B0007YMUZW|2.0|One of the songs on the new Ryan Adams CD is called \\"Easy Plateau.\\" It's an especially poignant title in that it's a polite way of summing up the feel of the whole darn album. Filled with mid-tempo drivel and buffed to a high production sheen, there's absolutely nothing here to grab onto - no pathos, no ebb-and-flow, no peaks and valleys. It's like someone sucked all the spooky ethos out of Chris Isaac and shoved a lap steel player into the studio with him. <br /> <br />This is the genius behind Whiskeytown?
B00006BTCA|5.0|Sure, the connections to Joy Division and others are there, but to me they sound a whole lot like the \\"today forever\\" release by Ride from the mid 90's. This is a good thing. For some of us over thirty types, it's strangely comforting to hear these chords and soundscapes again, strange because they seem to celebrate impermanance. Newer listeners will enjoy being propelled along by the architecture of the songs. Overall, a great effort.
B000002UZ1|5.0|This second collection 1967-1970 is so much better then their early music with better written lyrics, more mature subjects and better vocals. It is like they took a gigantic leap between their first tenous steps and then finally realized their potential and started making some of the best rock music ever.  The book-let is very nice and the lyrics are typed in an easy to read font. They look dreadfull though and those haircuts make them look like hobos. Apart from this is a work of true genius and they set a standard for rock muisicans that have been met by very few artists indeed, roling stones being one of them. This collection has some of their best tracks ever written and I could go on and on about it but if I had to pick a few then it is strawberry fields forever, across the universe and here comes the sun. This is a stupendous compilation for one of the best rock bands ever.
B0007OCG56|1.0|Who keeps hiring Adam Sandler and why?  He plays the same, unappealing, barely dimensional dolt who's no more appealing than lint and even less functional.  The film is rumored to run for 130 minutes but it seemed like days before my daze won out and the off button took the lead role.  Tea Leoni was obnoxiously and annoyingly good in her role as the neurotic, insecure wife.  I couldn't stand her.  Cloris Leachman was the only real talent so naturally, her screen time was limited.  Paz Vega shows potential but in this vehicle, I can only imagine that she jumped before it ever stopped moving.  She did in fact, attempt such a move.  How symbolic that was!  Do not pay to see this movie.  Instead, buy a pack of cigarettes.  The effects will be preferrable to sitting thru this farse.
B000002UYZ|5.0|This is a collection of early Beatles and whilst the music is awesome the lyrics are a bit basic compared to their later releases. To many of them have a bit to sweet sacharine air to them and they deal with love in a very juvenile manner. However, one also has to appreciate their innocent attitude towards love and the lyrics are infectious and even if you find them a bit trite you still sing along. It is also nice to see their lyrics mature with time and the later songs on this album show awesome potential. The book-let is well done but their clothes and haircuts are truly atrocious. Then again it was not like they ever dress particularly well and the 1960's was a decade when people created tacky art, dressed in the dark and the hairstyle was even worst. Even so the beatles have created som gems like eleanor rigby, I wan to hold your hand and many others.
B0007OCG56|1.0|while i found the movie enjoyable, i find it embarrassing and slightly insulting that no spanish language track or subtitles are included in this dvd. not even spanglish ones.
B00003CXA2|5.0|<br />I know Pulp Fiction is brilliant, but Forrest Gump deserve the oscar.I can watch this movie everyday, anyday.
B00005OWEG|2.0|This is an interesting film for its portrayal of the \\"insanity\\" of GIs in Vietnam in the late 60s. Do not however consider it to be an accurate depiction of what Vietnam was actually like, although there are some scenes that include a gritty element of reality. That being said, in a nutshell it is the tale of a special forces captain charged with hunting down a renegade army colonel who has taken up residence in the Cambodian jungle. The captain (Sheen) is accompanied by a small group of sailors who convey him up river. Along the way (the meat of the story) they encounter all sorts of strange characters and unlikely predicaments. <br />   Perhaps the best scenes in the film (and why I bothered to watch it) are the air cav scenes, where Robert Duvall delivers his famous napalm line, although the activities of the air cavalry are a bit far-fetched (as far as I'm aware). Other excellent, and mostly realistic scenes, are when Sheen's boat takes shore fire and when his boat encounters a Viet sampan and \\"inspects\\" it. Both scenes accurately show the chaos and fear GIs experienced in Vietnam. <br />   The good being said, the Redux version has its problems. Included are many scenes that stretch the movie to the limits of boredom (the French plantation in particular). Pertinent to both versions of the film, the constant barrage of unlikely situations the soldiers find themselves in is absurd. The film should be considered avant garde, or anything but a war film. At times, its just weird. And the extra length of Redux makes it difficult to stay awake to see the Brando scenes, where the real acting is. <br />   It might be worth your time, especially the Duvall scenes. You might want to fast forward through some of the recently included junk. If you can only see one post Vietnam film about the war, instead invest your time in Platoon!, with the younger Sheen in the lead role.
0790729628|5.0|Directors cut or not directors cut...this movie is brilliant! This movie makes me feel like home.....(whatever home means)I hope this is the first movie i've watched, and surely the last movie i want to watch before i die.  <br />I know harrison Ford hate this movie but that is his problem . Ridley Scott is genious! and so's Vangelist.  <br />
B00005Y6YB|5.0|A mini-series strong and powerful on all fronts. The quality of this film far surpasses most Hollywood Westerns to have come out on the big screen - to pull this gem off on network tv was next to unimaginable. <br />The acting is of the highest caliber. Duvall is amazing, and after seeing the conclusion, you will wish he had made another 4 episodes for the series. Jones and Glover, two actors I've never been particular fond of, also put in top-notch performances, as do the whole cast of characters, big names and unknowns. <br />The storyline is well composed, warm and funny and heartbreakingly tragic. Beautiful orchestral music complements the storyline. <br />The only negative thing I can say is that the original film could stand a retouch, and as someone said, the sound could tolerate some digitizing to make it dolby. The mini-series however is so awesome, I do not think this can detract from its overall rating.
B000001DTM|5.0|With its original sound, straightforward lyrics and  social message, the band U2 has been a worldwide critical and commercial success for more than two decades now. The album \\"Achtung Baby,\\" released in 1991, is one of their boldest enterprises and remains my favorite CD by the group... actually, it's one of best CDs ever released by anyone! I think it's a musical masterpiece!<br /><br />In November, 1989, the Berlin Wall came tumbling down. U2 finished their \\"Joshua Tree\\" tour in 1990 and flew to Berlin to begin a new album. The group was on the last commercial flight to land in Berlin before the unification of East and West Germany. It was an extraordinary time in world history. The track \\"Zoo Station\\" was inspired by a train station called \\"Zoo Bahnhof,\\" which had been the gateway to the East, when the world was divided by Cold War. And as the destruction of the Wall  represented a changing world, \\"Achtung Baby\\" signals \\"Attention\\"  - U2 is changing again too. Here they introduce industrial guitars, altered vocals, and electronic dance beats into the experimental mix. Rather than addressing world problems and politics, song lyrics convey a more intimate, introspective message of love, loneliness and heartbreak.<br /><br />Produced by Steve Lillywhite, \\"Achtung Baby\\" has twelve tracks and its run time is about an hour. I love the wildly romantic cut \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses.\\" The music caught my attention from the first, and the lyrics are phenomenal, \\"You're an accident waiting to happen / You're a piece of glass left there on the beach.\\" \\"Even Better Than The Real Thing,\\" is another I listen to over and over again. And \\"One\\" simply blows me away. It is so beautiful - a soulful and emotional ballad. Another heavy on the emotions track is \\"So Cruel,\\" with its painfully cutting lyrics and its simple piano sound: \\"You say in love there are no rules / Sweetheart / You're so cruel.\\" Bono's voice is intense here and the song comes to a stunning, shattering conclusion. \\"The Fly\\" showcases The Edge and  simply Wows!  \\"Until the End of the World\\" throbs with an energetic, almost tribal music, a great rock song and vastly underrated, to my mind.<br /><br />I can't recommend this brilliant, formidable U2 classic highly enough. Quite simply, it's great!!<br />JANAe Fly\\" showcases The Edge and  simply Wows!  \\"Until the End of the World\\" throbs with an energetic, almost tribal music, a great rock song and vastly underrated, to my mind.

0930289234|5.0|Written by Alan Moore, writer of [[ASIN:B000ICLRHU The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B000JSI7B2 From Hell [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B000FS9FCQ V for Vendetta (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]<br /><br />October 12, 1986, New York City. A man has just been murdered. Someone broke into his apartment while he was home and after a struggle the man was thrown through his window many floors above the street. The evidence points to a burglary gone wrong and even though the investigators aren't so sure they want to keep the case low profile so as not to draw the attention of any Masked Avengers (Vigilantes who used to patrol the city). Even though most of them have retired or been forced into retirement by the government, Rorschach is still active and has already taken note of the murder and become interested in the victim's identity.<br /><br />Rorschach's discovery of the victim's identity leads him to making contact with his old teammates from the Minutemen as Rorschach fears that someone is gunning for masked adventurers. Both past and present adventure ensues.<br /><br />This story was excellent and was probably one of the best written comic book/graphic novels I have read. This was originally released around 1986/87 as 12 separate comic books. I can't imagine having read this one chapter at a time then having to wait a month for the next installment. Luckily it has been collected in graphic novel form. The story revolves around the retired members of the old Minutemen group. Each member is visited by Rorschach as he attempts to warn them that someone may be gunning for them. In turn each character is reminded of their time in the group and begins to remember and reflect on the past and were are party to these reflections. The reward is characters with great depth coupled with an enjoyable and complex story (for a comic book) with a bonus. One of the fill in characters is reading a comic book in the story and we get to read along with this as well and the story in the story actually becomes pretty interesting as well.<br /><br />The Good: Great writing overall. The characters are all well drawn as we see them first in the present and are then given depth by seeing what happened to them in the past. The story is well thought out and has numerous twists and turns both in the present and in the telling of the past.<br /><br />The Bad: I was slightly disappointed with the ending but not so much as to sour the ride there on the way.<br /><br />Overall: Whether or not you are a comic book fan I highly recommend that you pick this up and give it a try.he story in the story actually becomes pretty interesting as well.<br /><br />The Good: Great writing overall.

B00097DX3U|3.0|usually its hard to make a follow up cd to any cd that a band makes - and in this case its true .. their 2nd cd is a nice cd but i think that its a cd that with time im gonna get into for now i like it but it didnt do what the 1st cd did to me when i 1st played it ..
6305014140|4.0|This was one of the first anime's I watched and I loved it. Extremely violent, very cool fight scenes. Action packed. The end of this wasnt as good as the ride getting there but it was still great as a whole.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The last time we saw a new release of the Star Wars trilogy were the infamous Special Edition VHS tapes, now they bring it to DVD, it is fantastic! I got out the original Star Wars out from a video store ages ago and the video was sooooooooooooo old! It had all its original VHS artwork which was cool, but the way it looked on TV was terrifying! It was crinkly and old, I wanted to watch it on DVD pretty badly, anyway it is out on DVD and a lot of people are comlaining about all these new changes! Its obvious its the best George Lucas could do for them, if you watch all the original movies in sequence it would look very silly when you get to episode IV,V and VI. Now that these alterations have been made it all pans out to one big great piece of work, after all those special effects on Episode III , anyone would laugh at the puppetry in Episode VI, though lots of people dont agree with me, I actually think the puppetry looks more convincing than computer generated things, but who wants to stay in the past?<br /><br />Basically this box set comes with all episodes 4-6 and a bonus material disc which , dissapointed me kind of, I wish it had more stuff! They couldve put so much stuff on here, the bonus disc is pretty much dominated by Empire of dreams. It was a great disc though, the movies are still fantastic, my favourites which many will disagree with are<br /><br />Return Of The Jedi<br /><br />The Empire Strikes Back<br /><br />Star Wars (AKA A New Hope)<br /><br />Lol, all those haters of these DVDs should come to terms that these movies needed a change! A BIG CHANGE to fit in with I , II, and III, atleast George hasnt gone and replaced all the original movies with new actors and made even bigger changes, we are fortunate enough to have these DVDs alone!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0000041BX|3.0|I am surprised that Alan Lekan (\\"Legendary Italians\\" 5/31/05) is the only reviewer to comment on the \\"booming\\" or thumping sound that appears throughout quartet number 14 regardless of the quality of playback equipment. Although the performances are outstanding Philips should never have released this recording, or at least not without a warning. Recommended purchase only to those who have other versions of #14.
0767847431|5.0|Golden Voyage of Sinbad was a landmark movie for reasons not known to many movie buffs. It was the first time a major studio--Columbia--decided to advertise a movie on television, saturating local and network stations with :30 second spots. It was a trial run to see whether expensive advertising on TV would pay off--and it did. Movies do not benefit so much these days from TV ads, but Golden Voyage opened the gates back in 1973.<br /><br />Now to the movie itself--a masterpiece of modest budgeted economy. A great cast, including the incomparable Martin Shaw as Sinbad's right-hand man, and Tom Baker making one of the most memorable (and sympathetic) villains in the history of cinema. John Phillip Law gets Sinbad just right--meaning he exudes confidence, doesn't overdo the accent, and has the right amount of humor to go along with his character.<br /><br />While Harryhausen's griffin and centaur have not aged well, the homunuculus remains a masterful creation of his stop-motion animation technique. Cameo appearance by Robert Shaw as the mysterious oracle rounds off this excellent movie--great for all ages.
0385336810|5.0|After having read the Shopaholic Series, I anxiously awaited \\"Can You Keep a Secret.\\" I was rewarding with this charming and funny tale which follow Emma Corrigan, my new favorite literature heroine. The book is filled with class and wit. You will not be able to put it down. Sophie Kinsella delivers yet again!!!!
0060594888|3.0|I read somewhere someone says that this book is the modern version of \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" I can't really agree with it becuase I have not read \\"Think and Grow Rich\\"<br /><br />I stopped by at the local library one day checking out Chicken Soup books and saw this new book and borrowed it. Read through it and like very small section of it. Yes from the title you can tell section 49 is my favorite and it is about Heart Talk. Much similar to what Paul and Layne Cutright taught in their training for couples or anyone who is in relationship.<br /><br />I dont really care for the rest of the book. It's very generic information like setting goals and etc.<br /><br />If you get only 1 idea out of any book it's worth the reading. I got mine from this book !!!<br /><br />One other thing I recommend before I let you go:<br /><br />Get the Audio book of the Chicken Soups, much better than the book, you can play it at the bed time ~
B00082IJ08|4.0|Of course it's different! They changed producers. But that doesn't make it bad - it just means that they're shifting gears. Of course, the addition of a new producer often does that. <br />Chances are slim that you don't have some background knowledge about Gorillaz or Blur if you bought this. It's not really geared towards the casual listener.  <br />If you own Demon Days, you're either a fan of Damon Albarn's original band, Blur, or you liked \\"Clint Eastwood\\", the much-lauded first single off of the debut Gorillaz album.  <br />If you're in the first group, you'll be happy! Demon Days is a great album that does much to revitalize Albarn's somewhat stale vision. Mixing Dub Reggae, techno, some of that Gorillaz kookiness, and even some gospel-tinged soul, it makes for a worthwhile listen, and is well worth your money.  <br />However, I belong to the second group. We loved that cymbal-splashed, bass-heavy groove on Clint Eastwood, with Del's signature drawl and Dan the Automator's signature sound. This collaboration is what made the debut a success. <br />While I respect Damon's attempts to experiment, and while I do love Demon Days, I can't understand for the life of me why he would oust Dan and Del. Damon has only had sparing success in the States, the only other popular stateside song of his being with Blur (\\"Whoo-Hoo!\\" That one); I don't see why he would do away with a possible chance for a wider audience, which he could later lure into a Blur concert or two, if they're still together (I've heard rumors...). <br />Still, you gotta love the guy for giving Danger Mouse a chance. As the editorial review says, DM's the guy who made the Grey Album, which mixed Jay-Z's Black Album with the Beatles' White Album. The album was a classic, and would've been internationally embraced if not for the legal problems that came with the work.  <br />I'm torn - I'll admit. <br />I loved Demon Days, but it wasn't what I expected (that seems like a common thread running through these reviews). <br />Every song on this album (except \\"Bright Light\\" and \\"DARE\\", which, while good, I found a bit repetitive) are great, and they boast a sound that's all their own. <br />Yet on the other hand, they don't have that standout single, and the music doesn't have that blip-heavy, Beck-ish groove it had on the debut. <br />So, I have a solution for group one (Blur heads) and group two (Del and Dan fans), as well as the casual listener who wants to do a little research. <br />First, get Demon Days. It's a great, cohesive album, which boasts an original sound. Nearly every song is a winner. <br />Personal Faves: <br />Last Living Souls <br />Kids With Guns <br />Dirty Harry <br />Feel Good Inc. <br />November Has Come <br />Fire Coming Out Of A Monkey's Head <br />Demon Days <br />Also, I recommend two other excellent albums alongside this; they'll allow you to figure out where Damon's coming from, and maybe even get a taste of what you're missing due to the line-up changes.  <br />The first is Parklife, the breakout album of Blur, Damon's band. <br />The second is Deltron 3030, a collaborative effort of Dan the Automator and Del.  <br />I won't delve too deeply into the albums - both can be looked up on Amazon, if you're interested, but these two will fill in the gaps that Demon Days left out. Buy all three! You won't regret it!

0226039331|5.0|This lexicon is 'indispensable' for New Testament exegesis. I could not have written my book without it. The pagination and font selection in this new, third edition have been improved over the second edition. Eye strain has been reduced with the word and definition entries being made more 'visually accessible'--pertinent data \\"pops-out\\" as you scan down the listings. It is no secret that the scholarship is probably the best available. I haven't seen the CD-ROM yet, it may be the answer for those who are tired of 'lifting and flipping.'
B0000QX0WE|5.0|this is an awesome album, if you consider yourself a true Leppard fan, this is a must have!!! <br /> <br />i just wanted to see if anyone knew the difference between this import cd and the original (american) cd.  im a big fan but i dont want to get ripped of just for some japanese characters on the cover.... anyone got any advice?
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|This is by far the WORST album I have ever heard by SOAD. Skip this mockery of an album and buy the older SOAD stuff! Very annoying to hear Daron's voice & influence all over this album. What a waste of time!!!!!!!
B00080Z53O|5.0|This was an outstanding movie on so many levels. It thoughtfully examines life and death and love ---- and the convergence of all three. The acting was outstanding, all of it, especially Javier Bardem as Ramon Sampedro. I am always struck, when I watch sub-titled films, at how much more attention I pay to facial expressions and how much this adds to my enjoyment and appreciation  of the film. Expressions are a large part of the acting in \\"The Sea Inside\\".<br /><br />This was a movie that will leave its viewers pondering and thinking about so many things and examining one's beliefs. One of the things that Ramon wrote:  \\"I think that living is a right, not an obligation. Nevertheless, I have been obligated to tolerate this pitiful situation...\\" are haunting words that will stay with me for a long time.
B000244EMO|5.0|This movie is a classic, from every perspective. It is action packed with amazing special effects and much more... I don't understand why AVP was so dumb as this movie had set a standard for it. The Behind scenes features were awesome, take you through almost every single element of making this movie, it's like you were at the set yourself. <br /> <br />The sequel sucked and the AVP sucked, if you like predator, this is your only choice, and yet your best choice.
B00082IJ08|4.0|First of all, looking over the reviews here I see...well, no reviews! It seems the fans of Gorillaz are virtual fans, not real fans at all (and they don't seem to know their music history!) Gorillaz is a side project predominantly, but not entirely, by Blur's Damon Albarn. As with their first cd, \\"Demon Days\\" is a mixture of trip-hop, hip-hop, rap, funk, and now add in children's choir vocals on \\"Dirty Harry\\" (perhaps a sequel to \\"Clint Eastwood\\"?), and the London Gospel Choir on songs \\"Don't Get Lost In Heaven\\" and \\"Demon Days\\". Being 15 songs in length, and running nearly 50 minutes, \\"Demon Days\\" has a wide array of musical styles all tied into one album. It's somewhat uneven, just like their first, but I think this is slightly better than their debut. I enjoyed some of the darker songs like \\"Last Living Souls\\", \\"Kids With Guns\\" and the Dennis Hopper spoken word \\"Fire Coming Out Of The Monkey's Head\\".<br /><br />The first single \\"Feel Good, Inc.\\" has a great rap from De La Soul, and \\"Kids With Guns\\" utilizes a sample of Salt 'N' Pepa's \\"Push It\\" along with the vocal talents of Neneh Cherry. I found \\"Dirty Harry\\" to be one of the best songs on the cd though, and it should be the next single if the band is wise. This is one strange disc due to the swing in emotional content from the darkness of the aformentioned songs to the bright ending of \\"Don't Get Lost In Heaven\\" and \\"Demon Days\\", and you could add \\"Dare\\" to the list as well.<br /><br />There were several songs that could have been left off such as the mostly instrumental \\"O Green World\\", \\"Every Planet We Reach Is Dead\\", \\"November Has Come\\" and \\"White Light\\"--which seems to use some sample from a horror movie as it's chorus. Taken all together, this is one of the more eclectic cds released this year, maybe alongside Beck's \\"Guero\\". \\"Demon Days\\" entered the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart at number 6, selling 107,000 copies in its first week of release, so there must be many more fans that obviously haven't written their reviews here yet!ritten their reviews here yet!
0316168815|2.0|I should have liked this book, I keep telling myself now, not only because my half of my family read this and thought it was brillant.  But I did not like it. <br /> <br />The whole concept and plot to this book is outstanding: the idea of following a murdered child, and how she looks and observes her family coping is an excellent, if not totally new, idea that certainly did it for me.  But after the first 100 pages, it just turns out to be another red-herring. <br /> <br />The whole idea that Susie was really in heaven made me wonder.  It seemed more appropriate to call it a hell rather than a heaven.  Just think: she watches her family mourn her from above for a period of over 8 years, and she never really has any chance to enjoy the real heaven because she indebted to her time on Earth. <br /> <br />Of course, this is what the author drew upon: Susie's unbiased view from heaven.  But, the author could have done without this; but then why?  Because if she had, then the book would be just like any other loss story.  So she decided to add in the dead girl.  The idea was good, but the author went about it wrong. <br /> <br />Half-way through the book, I was actually hoping that it would end.  I grew tired of reading through the linear characters and their nothing in teh form of progress throughout the book.  Even Susie (the dead girl) lacked any development whatsoever. <br /> <br />Susie's relationship with her parents while she was living was never really adequately addressed, save for a scene about making boats in glasses with her father.  Aside the fact that they were her parents, a better explanation and a more concrete portrayel would better explain certain things that happened later in the book.  Such as Susie's mother getting up and leaving. <br /> <br />Another thing (I know many found this disturbing): Why is it, that finally when Susie was able to come down from heaven and able to inhibit a real human, that she chose to engage in the very act that her killer used before he'd killed her?  If I were her, it would make more sense to go screaming to everyone who had killed me, where my body was, how many others he had killed, but have sex?  Too weird. <br /> <br />I really try not to limit a review to the bad portions, but there are really no other good things I can say about this book except that it read well. <br /> <br />It was also too long.
B0002X314C|5.0|well, this album is amazing, for a very long time I haven't enjoied from an RnB album, like I enjoy this one... <br />first and formost, john legend's voice is amazing, not powerfull like other RnB singers, but very unique. <br />all the songs on the album  makes you feel like you listen to soul/RnB from the 60's-70's mixed up with the RnB sound of today... <br /> <br />I believe that if you wanna try somthing new in the RnB, and even if you don't like kanye west productions (kanye produced some of the songs on the cd), you will like this cd, because it's diffrent and excellent...

0060763280|1.0|I stumble on this book at the book store and and I spent 20 minutes skimming this book.  I was disappointed.  The book has nothing new to share.  Don't get me wrong. I like books that can educate you and prepare you to how to be rich.  However, I think most \\"how to get rich books\\" such as this one are overrated.  They are pretty much same, saying the same thing over and over again such as focus on opportunities, stay positive, and stay out of debt. I don't understand why people in general can't seem to live within their means, educate them self about how to make money in the stock markets, real estates, or any ventures that will make them money.  To me most people are just follower, eating up any mumbo jumbo \\"how to get rich books\\".  Please don't buy this buy.  Thank you.

B000286S8S|2.0|Two words for you, \\"cash grab\\".  How hard should it be to come up with a greatest hits compilation for one of the all time great American rock bands.  I guess pretty difficult.  The new songs are average at best, the running order is idiotic, and whoever came up with the genius idea of putting live Roth era songs sung by Sammy Hagar on the disc should be slowly tortured.  This is a good intro for the casual fan, but for die-hards how about releasing something that we don't already have three times over?  All of us die-hards know that Van Halen has a vault full of unreleased finished studio songs as well as a large amnount of professional shot live video that have never been released.  Why not release some of that?  But what do we get?  Between LP, cassette, CD, Right Here Right Now, Greatest Hits Volume 1 and this release we have our seventh release of Ain't Talkin' Bout Love.  Great, thanks a bunch guys. <br /> <br />Finally, not having any pictures of Dave or Gary Cherone and not including at least one Van Halen III song is a slap in the face to your former band memebers, and I am almost 100% positive that it wasn't unintentional.
B000002H97|5.0|the self titled album was the last great album from this great heavy metal band.this ranks amongst my favourites due to the presence of excellent songs like UNFORGIVEN and NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.hugely recommended along with RIDE THE LIGHTNING album from the same band.

I (personally) like the high-low-high-low.

B00003CXCW|5.0|Re-watching this 1950 classic recently, the phrase \\"Hollywood Gothic\\" popped into mind.  It was one of those phrases that seemed so apt at the time, that I had to wonder if I hadn't read it somewhere else before.  You know, sometimes you come up with a phrase so good, you figure it can't be original. Anyway, whether it's my own phrase or an unconscious steal, I was thinking of a transplanted kind of \\"Southern Gothic\\" feel. Locale a little creepy, peopled by characters way beyond merely eccentric.    If \\"Hollywood Gothic\\" is a legitimate sub-genre, it would have at least one other classic among its ranks, namely, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?--but SUNSET BOULEVARD was the original, and the best.  When it comes to portraying batty older actresses, Gloria Swanson is without peer--or peeress.  She conveys a level of insanity and depravity that Bette and Joan together only begin to suggest.      Despite its setting in America's Dream Factory, this Billy Wilder classic has an oddly European feel to it.  Maybe it's Erich von Stroheim's presence as the ever-lurking butler Max.  Or maybe it's Wilder's own German expat sensibility.  Or maybe it's the film's worldweary thematic focus on the ravages of time.  Indeed this 1950 film's implicit nostalgia for the Hollywood of the 20s and 30s seems especially ironic--one could say \\"doubly nostalgic\\" and therefore \\"doubly ironic\\"--some fifty-five years on.  What would a Norma Desmond have to say about today's effects-ridden flicks?   Did they get \\"small\\" or \\"bigger\\" in loud and virtually unrecognizable way?    Or would Cecil B. DeMille be right at home in the current climate?  He (and presumably Norma too) were purveyors of spectacle after all.  It's just that in today's spectacles, the entity \\"ready\\" for its close-up is more likely to be a starship, a \\"perfect storm\\" or an explosion and conflagration than a beautiful actress.
B000068PQ0|5.0|At this point in their career it wouldn't be fair to demand from the Lips a stylistic shift in every album but they still somehow manage to surprise and startle upon the release of their recordings.Yoshimi is a departure in the same way \\"Cluds Taste Metallic\\"'s psychedelia surprised after \\"Transmission from the Satellite Heart\\"'s bubblegum pop or the way \\"The Soft Bulletin\\"'s orchestral and baroque pop came as a surprise after the previous freaked experiments.<br /><br />Yoshimi is more of an electronically based and bass heavy album than any they had ever done but what doesn't falter is the essential trait in their last few albums-the resplendescent songwriting they have achieved while still seeming bent on bettering it.<br /><br />Psy pop rock doesn't get any better than this.
B000069AUI|2.0|Unimaginative songs, delivered with repetitive and monotonous,  completely dull vocals. I just do not understand the hype nor the interest unless ofcourse, it is more about the lead singers relationship with his famous, and equally dull, wife and his tendancy to name children while visiting the greengrocers.<br /><br /> Every generation gets saddled with a dull band most people don't appreciate and who end having no real talent and longevity much beyond their media hype, witness Oasis. Not worth listening to and I guarantee you will tire of it and find it irritating eventually.
B00097A5I6|1.0|I know there are a lot of major Oasis fans out there and the last thing I would want to do is anger all of you. To see these suspiciously-aged men jump about on their videos like children was truly hilarious. Music-wise, it is difficult to find the words to describe quite how dreadful this KIDDIE-BAND is. Another appalling corporate band that gives children more useless heroes and floods the charts of good music. Any adult that finds this 'uplifting' is small-minded to the point of disfunction. Save your money on this trash <br /> <br />Oasis are very cutsey-poo. Their songs sound like little girl songs that I would of liked when I was maybe 5! They have no real music talent. You can't go through life as a singer just because you have a cute, pretty voice. You have to learn how to use it right. Does the word harmony ring a bell? Okay, Okay, they have some, but not enough, and not good ones. My school chorus has better ones than their's. Some peope like that type of music, but I know REAL music when I hear it, and this is not real music!  <br /> <br />My young grandson bought this album when it was first released,don't ask me why?.Oaiss are,high pitched,squeaky and annoying.The four of them must take a dose of helium before they sing a song.It is unfair to other bands out there who are trying to scrape a recording deal and can't,and these bands are so much better and more experienced than be-witched ever will be! In today's world it is typical for bands such as Coldplay,Five,Elton John and the Spice Girls to get a recording deal so quickly.This is un-deserved.Bands like Steps ripping of songs such as \\"Tragedy\\" and making some serious cash!Is there anyone in their right mind who thinks this is fair? But Oasis really do display undeserved success.The sad thing is,is that there is actually a market for these kind of artists,that's the sad part.A band that display terrible vocals and cannot dance for peanuts.Keep your money in your pocket,until you come across somethingwhich you can listen to without cringing. <br />COME ON LADS, ENOUGH OF THE PREPPY MUSIC! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B00025ETIW|5.0|The first MCR song I heard was I'm Not Okay (I Promise) and I thought it was really poppy but I still thought it was a good song.I went and got their CD and after i listened to it for the first time I was in love with them.The rest of the record is really different from I'm Not Okay.I heard them play Helena live at Taste of Chaos and it sounds just as good live as it does on the record. The whole album is full of really amazing songs and it's just as great as the first album. It's different from the first album because this record was a concept album but I think people should listen to the album before they label it as just another emo record.
B00008EY7H|5.0|Incredible acrobatics, wonderful music, dazzling artistry...this description doesn't even come close to describing what you'll experience watching Alegra, one of Cirque's oldest (and best) shows. Very revamped from its first years, the show's fresher than ever, and this recording shows it. <br />Spanish for \\"happiness\\", Alegra's quite a moody show; don't let that turn you off though, it's not a depressing show, but rather one that can spark your innermost feelings. You'll know what I mean when you see one particular act: the clown's \\"Snowstorm\\" act. Cirque's creativity is really displayed here, since it's not your traditional \\"goofy\\" clown; this clown can draw tears from your eyes, it's the most expressive clown act I've seen, and it's woth a look by anyone. Every other act is equally wonderful, including a syncro trapeze, fire-knife dance and Russian bars. The music is a delightful mix of mellow and joyful tunes sung in Spanish, Italian, French, English, and \\"Cirque-ish\\", all beautifully performed by Francesca Gagnon and Eve Montpetit. The DVD's extras include the very interesting \\"Meet the Artists\\" feature, a making of featurette, an Australian-produced documentary recorded during the show's stay there, and a multi-angle feature for 2 of the acts. <br />The show's slightly sad feel may not appeal to the very young in the family, but it will be tons of fun for everyone else; buy it now if you don't have it (or if your budget doesn't allow you to watch it live).
B0006J28KU|4.0|Heat has been talked up for not only being a great crime drama but also because Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino are finally together in the same film.  This is a great crime film but as far as the other piece of hype let me just inform you that DeNiro and Pacino are only in two scenes together and those 2 scenes are very short.  If you watch this movie expecting anything more concerning the pairing of these two giants of the film world then you'll be deeply disappointed.  If you can around that fact then you'll enjoy Heat.<br /><br />Pound for pound I have to say that DeNiro is the better actor.  Pacino has a tendency to yell and scream his lines in hopes of being more intense and dramatic.  DeNiro doesn't have to do that.<br /><br />Heat contains one of the best shootouts I've ever seen on film.  The street scene with everyone shooting at everyone else is realistic and some may think over the top but I say it's on target (no pun intended).  While the main focus is on the good guy trying to catch the bad guy, the other view is of these two men and their external relationships with others outside of what they do.  Note also that they secretly admire each other.  So much so in fact, that they agree to meet each other and state that they will do what they have to do to come out on top.  I've often wondered if they could really have been brothers and therefore, hesitant to kill one another.  Hence the meeting to warn the other man what might happen.<br /><br />Although there is plenty of action here, it's the story that drives the film.  It's not just a shoot 'em up.  I enjoyed seeing Dennis Haysbert (played the president on 24) here.  His role isn't that big but at least he gets to go out in a blaze of glory.  Somebody give this guy more films to do!!!<br /><br />As usual with these kind of films one tends to root for the bad guy.  Pacino's character, for me a least, evokes no sympathy.  He ignores his wife and stepdaughter for the sake of the job and his wife cheats on him because he won't talk to her.  You just don't feel sorry for him.  DeNiro's character on the other hand is a guy that never allowed himself to have all the trappings of a normal life.  He never wanted to feel tied down.  He wanted to be able to  pick up and take off at a moments notice.  That changes though and you want him to get away with this last crime and then settle down to be \\"normal\\".<br /><br />Val Kilmer is excellent as the cumpulsive career criminal/gambler that just can't let go of his life of crime no matter how much his wife (Ashely Judd) begs him.<br /><br />The final scene is wonderful.  Cinematography, scenery, characters and music all fit together so well that you can't take your eyes off the screen.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the genre then you must have this film in your collection.
2266144340|3.0|What is the hype and hysteria all about?  It is just an ordinary thriller.  The characters are shallow and the plot has several inconsistencies. If you put all the mysticism aside, it is all about \\"good guys\\" who look for clues to solve riddles while being chased by the \\"bad guys\\".  It is just like a computer game or any other thriller for that matter.<br /><br />Dan Brown has managed to fool many readers that his fiction is based on real people, real facts, and real historic events.  Unfortunately, both history and science facts were highly inaccurate.  Either Mr. Brown did a sloppy research or he deliberately twisted the facts to fit his story.  He even starts the book by claiming that the Priory of Sion and the list of Grand Masters are FACTS.<br /><br />There really was a catholic order called the Order of Sion.  It was dissolved in the 17the century and its members became Jesuit monks.  There is nothing interesting about it.  The so called List of the Grand Masters however is not a fact but a hoax invented by a right wing French political organization known as the Priory of Sion.  They were hoping to obtain credibility by associating themselves with famous men.  The Priory was not a clandestine organization and had nothing to do with the medieval order.  They published a newspaper and constantly sought the spot light.  They were mostly ridiculed by the French society.<br /><br />Many other \\"facts\\" in this book are also twisted to give them a mysterious angle.  Besides, Dan Brown is relaying too much on biast feminist interpretations of the Bible.<br /><br />I have to admit that I enjoyed reading the book.  I was hooked by the story until the last chapters when the plot started to fall apart.  The ending of a thriller makes it or breaks it.  This one didn't make it.
0786915749|3.0|Let me note that I got dragged kicking and screaming to this novel.  I recently read the War of Souls trilogy and loved it. I had been putting off reading any Dragonlance novels for years as I assumed they were all schlock.  Well, the War of Souls proved that these novels were interesting, well-written, and fun.  Based upon my good experience in reading that triology I decided to start at the beginning and see what came before the War of Souls. I just finished DoAT and while i enjoyed it, parts were incredibly slow and I struggled to push myself through it.  While I still plan to read the next 2 books in this trilogy I've switched gears for a bit and I've just started Raymond Feist's newest triology, Talon of a Silver Hawk.  I think I'll finish that series before heading back to Ansalon.   <br />

Anyway, the story was well written, but if you are not a fan of reading, you may find it hard to get into or not like it at all. I would suggest watching the movie (musical, Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum) first, since you will be pleasantly surprised (and not so pleasantly) of the extra details in the book. I highly suggest this book and movie.
B00005JKDR|5.0|\\"Monsters Inc\\" is an incredibly refreshing and halarious animated film which blends original plotlines, beautiful colours, a haralious screenplay and important messages together. Personally, \\"Monsters Inc\\" is my favourite Pixar movie yet, simply because of its wittyness and ability to engrip the audience into the world behind the bedroom closet. <br /> <br />Monstropolis is the city of Monsters, concealed from the human world by the cupboards of children's bedrooms. Their way of life is dependant on the use of children's screams, to which provides electricity and power. The corperation, Monsters Incorperated is responsible for gathering these screams from these \\"highly toxic\\" children - \\"a single touch from a human child could kill you!\\" - by scaring them wittless. It is here where we meet Sully (voice of John Goodman), a teddy-bear like monster who is the most successful \\"scarer\\" in the company. Ironically, when a human girl crawls into his world, he develops an attatchment to her. Sully, along with his halarious one-eyed pal Mike (voice of Billy Crystal), embark on a race against time to return \\"Boo\\" (as she is nicknamed) back to her rightful human world before the evil monsters get her instead. <br /> <br />It is a truly delightful film. Here, Pixar has moulded their Monsters of all different shapes, colours, skin types, and sizes to have human-like qualities; imagine the human world and its ways of working, except the humans are played by monsters! It is this irony that gives \\"Monsters Inc\\" its originality. <br /> <br />The famous 3D animation of Pixar is always absolutely brilliant. Each monster is unique, and the settings are simply devine. A particular mind-boggling scene is when the main characters Sully, Mike and Boo are on a roller-coaster like journey in the place where all the children's doors of the world are stored. It is an absolutely riveting scene! How the animators managed it is beyond me! The animation of Boo is also delightful, in that she is represented to convey the utmost innoncence and cuteness of a 2-year-old toddler. <br /> <br />The screenplay, in typical Pixar fashion is halarious and enjoyable, offering puns for both its childhood and adult demographs. Almost every scene has a joke and adds extra strength to the overall film. Billy Crystal's character Mike is a wonderful, funny character, who lights up every scene. A film that can appeal equally to all ages is an excellent one, and \\"Monsters Inc\\" certainly successes here. <br /> <br />And finally, as well as being undeniably funny, it also has, as all children's films should, powerful messages which are portrayed subtly in the film. The film teaches us to look beyond appearances and see the inner beauty of something. You shouldn't follow what other people say, because more than likely it's not true. And finally, and more importantly, it teaches us not to bully people, because it's going to come back to haunt you. Live life positively, seeing the quality in the poeple around you, and yourself. <br /> <br />So in conclusion, \\"Monsters Inc\\" is my favourite Pixar animation because it is such a wonderful breath of fresh air. By mixing exquisite animation, appealing comedy for all ages and possessing important messages, this is a simply stunning film. It opens to the door to a new centurt of animation.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Have you heard the story of \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\"? A long time ago, there lived an Emperor who was very rich and arrogant. He pampered himself and he loved expensive clothes. One day he ordered 2 tailors to sew him new attire to show off to the whole kingdom, and if he is unhappy with the clothes, he will execute them. Running out of time, the 2 tailors became scared and when the Emperor summoned them, they came and showed the Emperor \\"air\\" and claimed it was a special robe which only intelligent people can see. Of course, no one could see anything there but they didn't want to be labelled as stupid. So, everyone from the Emperor to his ministers said that they could see it and mentioned how beautiful it was. At last, the Emperor marched naked across his kingdom. <br /> <br />The reason I told that story is because I feel this movie is something like the clothes. There's nothing there, but people are making a big hoo-ha about it. Bare in mind though, it is not a particularly bad movie, but it isn't good either. <br /> <br />The story is set in Tokyo, a city bustling with life and color. Bob Harris is a Hollywood has-been who is in Tokyo filming some commercials. During his stay, he is in frequent contact with his wife who seems to rely on him to make petty decisions like picking the correct marble color etc. Meanwhile, young \\"just married\\" Charlotte is also in Tokyo with her husband, John. John is a photographer and is rarely in the hotel. That leaves Charlotte feeling lonely. She does however notice Bob in the hotel many times, and so does Bob. A friendship is formed between the both of them as they share some weird moments together. And so the story progresses... <br /> <br />I don't know, I tried to like this movie. I even watched it 3 times because I thought I missed something the first time I watched it. But it's just mediocre. I could barely sustain my interest in the movie. If it were half an hour longer, honestly I would've switched off my TV. I am someone very open-minded about movies and I even love artsy movies, but this movie does not offer anything special. The concept of the movie was interesting enough and as the movie was building up, I was waiting for something intelligent, something quirky, something different but unfortunately, it never came. <br /> <br />Bill Murray was basically playing himself in this movie, though not at his best. He basically sulks around looking pathetic. Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte did a good job, she's a talented actress and I have much respect for her but unfortunately, she can just do as much as the script allows her to. The screenplay which was written by Sofia Coppola, seemed too dry for my taste. I love intelligent dialogue, witty humour and sometimes just plain facts presented in an entertaining way, none of which I felt present in this movie. It really was  a surprise for me when she took home the Oscar for this category. <br /> <br />Well, as I said...this isn't a bad movie, but considering the attention and hype it got, suffice to say I was disappointed with it. In my opinion, it's an okay movie but just don't have high expectations of it. I wouldn't buy it, and to be honest I wouldn't even rent it. Good thing I have HBO.
B0007Y08PQ|4.0|To non-fans of Star Trek,there is the\\"odd numbered film curse\\",which odd numbered Trek film come off as disappointing (finally broken with Star Trek Nemesis).  <br />Usually the problem is the filmakers second guessing fan expectation after the sucess of an even numbered film, injecting a bigger budget  <br />The budget was more than the average box office take of the other films.Overall Insurrection was a better movie than most of the Oddies(except 3).It had some very funny moments,and Patrick Stewart seemed to be having fun as Picard.But one can't help but feel the story would've been better suited on TV.And considering the great quality of DS9 episodes with the Dominion War,you also feel the writers should've strived for more on the big screen.  <br />As expected the Box office tally was lower than expected.But in the end,it was a very entertaining film but you feel it could've been better.  <br />
B000001GOZ|4.0|Boulez gives a top-notch reading of the Mahler 6th, and it's true that his tempi are near-perfect and the playing of the VPO astonishingly good.  The only thing lacking is any real fire.  The interpretations seems pretty tepid, and there isn't much excitement in the enormous finale, a movement that demands hieghtened emotions.  That's probably why the hammer blows are so \\"wimpy,\\" as one reviewer said.  Had they been the big booms which most conductors favor, they would have been jarringly out of place in Boulez' reading.  There's no way they would have been convincing.  Essentially, I found this to be a very French rendering of a Germanic score.  There are astonishing moments of clarity and beauty--revelatory, in fact.  Boulez brings out lines in the music that never were apparent to me before.  But still, when all is said and done, the performance intrigued me, but did not get me emotionally involved.  I could keep a cool distance to the performance that I never can with Barbirolli, Bernstein or Szell.
B00005B36H|5.0|I have never heard music so beautiful and meaningful in my life.  After four years of owning this album, I still listen to it as if I had just bought it yesterday.  Aside from brilliant instrument work, Maynards vocals is what gives this album the uplifting emotional depth that it has.  Maynards lyrics of hope and redemption are a great escape from all the angry styles of music today.  My favorite aspect of this album is how you can get lost in the music itself.  Even though the shortest song on the album is just over five minutes, you get so absorbed into what you are listening to that the song ends leaving you wanting more.  To really appreciate this albums potential, you must find time to actually sit down and listen to it closely.  Tool is without a doubt the most talented group of musicians in the music industry today and even the past thirteen years.  If you dont like this album or this band in general, you dont know what music is or you are probably just stupid.
B000006TRV|4.0|\\"The Wall\\" should have been a better album. <br /> <br />Before you click angrily on the \\"Disagree\\" button, let me explain my logic.  Despite \\"The Wall\\"'s depth, unity of vision and interesting plot and Freudian subtext, there is something missing in the majority of the songs.  That something is musicality. <br /> <br />Much of Disc 1 (Side 1 and 2 for the original record) is tough to listen to.  The melodies are sparse, the atmosphere thick, and much of it frequently grating.  Try listening to \\"Don't Leave Me Now\\" more than once in a row without going ballistic.  It's as if, when the teacher in \\"Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2\\" is shouting \\"How can you have your pudding if you don't eat your meat?!\\" Roger Waters is yelling at us to choke down the meat of these tough songs to get to the pudding later to be had.  Waters even had something of a captive audience when the album was originally released, as there was no 'Skip' button on record players.  Listeners were forced to wade through the discordance to find the melodies. <br /> <br />Those melodies have a tendency to show up much more frequently in the second disc, when we get songs like \\"Comfortably Numb\\", with its soaring guitar solos and vibrant chorus.  The album becomes much more interesting in general after Pink's Wall has been built, if not because of the greater musicality shown in the song I just mentioned, as well as \\"Hey You\\", \\"Nobody Home\\", and \\"Run Like Hell\\", then in terms of story. <br /> <br />It is worthwhile to note here that \\"The Wall\\" is an extraordinarily depressing and pessimistic work.  Even on songs that sound somewhat upbeat (\\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"Mother\\"), the schizophrenia of the lyrics ensures that this is not the case.  The \\"Pink Floyd\\" that is the main character of this rock opera suffers long and hard at the hands of - well, everyone in his life, especially himself.  The paranoia, anger and insanity that makes up this album's core is strong and pronounced in every piece of the album, which accounts for another reason it is so difficult to listen to. <br /> <br />The last reason is the sheer cheesiness of some of the songs.  There's pretentiousness bleeding out of the album's climax, \\"The Trial\\", which isn't helped by the fact that it has the pomposity of real (not rock) opera.  Some of this music is some of the most pretentious this side of heavy metal, and you can practically hear \\"Spinal Tap\\" knocking. <br /> <br />What saves this is the story, the same story that I previously mentioned as being depressing and pessimistic.  It is, but it's also well-thought out and very interesting, albeit unclear without additional information (such as liner notes, or the movie adaptation). <br /> <br />Overall, the \\"Wall\\" is a stunning work, but not quite the magnum opus \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" was.  It's still worth listening to for those with patience and an ability to see past musical shortcomings to the lyrics and meaning underneath.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Hey, am I supposed to be one upped by a kid? hahaha-get a job buddy, and a taste for true prog music- then we'll talk.
B000002U82|5.0|Well, my review would be true to its title if this album's depth had not already been lauded by several million fans.  Still, I will persist in saying that the songs on this album are much more than just music.  The lyrics attain a depth and meaning here that is seen frequently in Floyd, but much less frequently in other bands. <br /> <br />Frustratingly, several of the songs on the album are more mood pieces than anything else, \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\", \\"Any Color You Like\\" and especially the infuriatingly dull \\"On The Run\\". <br /> <br />The good outweights the bad, however.  Songs like \\"Breathe\\", \\"Time\\", \\"Us and Them\\" and \\"Brain Damage\\" are thoughtful, important pieces that deal with real issues beyond the realm of sex and drugs that most pop/rock is limited to.  Most of this album is about everyday life, but it's delivered so convincingly that it becomes epic, in a manner similar to the Beatles' \\"Day in the Life\\". <br /> <br />\\"Dark Side\\"'s themes are important, but what's more important is that its music is both enjoyable and fitting with the lyrics, unlike the band's later work \\"The Wall\\".  The dreamy pitch-bending of \\"Breathe\\"; the clanging of bells which slowly evolves into a psychedelic trip then breaks out into hard rock in \\"Time\\"; the way \\"Us and Them\\" begins quietly but crescendos into a Big Statement that is meaningful enough to deserve that title. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"Dark Side\\" is deservedly a classic album, and will continue to be for years to come.
B00022M518|5.0|After  his stint with Roxy Music Brian Eno broke out  with his first album \\"Here Come the Warm Jets\\". It is a strange wonderful brew of hard rock, punk, sweet ballads, electronic music and of course glam rock. But all of those elements add up to something truly unique and outrageous.    Imagine if you would a cross between the darkness of the Beatle's White Album and David Bowie's \\"Hunky Dory\\" laced with Eno's synthesizer and Fripp's piecing guitar and you might come close to the sound of this  CD.    The lyrics, all written by Eno,  vary in quality from song to song    but some of them show a true genius with words. Some of the songs are also very funny.    The song titles also reflect the craft of a gifted wordsmith and  mostly have a threatening quality. But Eno is playing a hide and seek game with the  listener as  part toughian part effeminate aesthete.     The musicians  on the album are first rate comprised of  members of Roxie Music and Robert Fripp. Fripp, former King Crimson member and practicing Sufi, is a real stand out in this album.    I have included in this review the songs which I believe contain the strongestlyrics.     The album starts of with driving guitars in the first song    \\"Needle in the Camel's Eye\\". Musically it is somewhat akin  to standard early glam rock. Through it  Eno's  voice  goes up and down in almost a yodel.          The second  song \\"Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch\\" is another quirky song featuring squeaky electronic music and in parts featuring a hard driving guitar.       \\"Baby's on Fire\\" is probably the most memorable song on the album. It  mostly features percussive music  interspersed with  electronic  music that weaves in and out of it. But in the middle of the song Robert Fripp wails in a guitar solo that really shows off his virtuosity. Fripp makes the guitar sing in a way only Fripp can.      \\"Baby's on fire  Better throw her in the water  Look at her laughing  Like a heifer to the slaughter    Baby's on fire  And all the laughing boys are bitching  Waiting for photos  Oh the plot is so bewitching    Rescuers row row  Do your best to change the subject  Blow the wind blow blow  Lend some assistance to the object    Photographers snip snap  Take your time she's only burning  This kind of experience  Is necessary for her learning    If you'll be my flotsam  I could be half the man I used to  They said you were hot stuff  And that's what baby's been reduced to    Juanita and Juan  Very clever with maracas  Making their fortunes  Selling secondhand tobaccoes    Juan dances at Chico's  And when the clients are evicted  He empties the ashtrays  And pockets all that he's collected    But baby's on fire  And all the instruments agree that  Her temperature's rising  But any idiot would know that\\"       \\"Cindy Tells Me\\" has Eno again backed up with a soft chorus  that almost reminds one of the Beach Boys  but then begins to rock. A shimmering  electronic  sound produced by synthesizer soon joins in. All in all it comes off  as a type of anthem.    \\"Cindy tells me, the rich girls are weeping  Cindy tells me, they've given up sleeping alone  And now they're so confused by their new freedoms  And she tells me they're selling up their maisonettes  Left the hotpoints to rust in the kitchenettes  And they're saving their labour for insane reading.  Some of them lose - and some of them lose  But that's what they want - and that's what they choose  It's a burden - such a burden  Oh what a burden to be so relied on.  Cindy tell me, what will they do with their lives  Living quietly like labourer's wives  Perhaps they'll re-acquire those things they've all disposed of.\\"       \\"Driving Me Backwards\\" starts with a slow driving  and dark piano music. The whole song is actually fairly dark. Eno's voice is modified  to create a number of effects  including  echo and over laying.        \\"On Some Faraway Beach\\" is a somewhat sweet featuring light drumming and  piano accompanying a choir. The lyrics show great originality as well as a morbid sentimentality.      \\"Given the chance  I'll die like a baby  On some far away beach  When the season's over.  Unlikely  I'll be remembered  As the tide brushes sand in my eyes  I'll drift away.  Cast up on a plateau  With only one memory  A single syllable  Oh lie low lie low.\\"        \\"Blank Frank\\" is fairly acerbic musically (a friend of mine compared it to the sound of having your teeth drilled by a dentist) but it is nevertheless an inventive sound and the lyrics are very clever.    \\"Blank frank is the messenger of your doom and your destruction  Yes, he is the one who will set you up as nothing  And he is one who will look at you sideways  His particular skill is leaving bombs in people's driveways.  Blank frank has a memory that's as cold as an iceberg  The only time he speaks is in incomprehensible proverbs  Blank frank is the siren, he's the air-raid, he's the crater  He's on the menu, on the table, he's the knife and he's the waiter\\"        \\"Dead Finks Don't Talk\\" is a song  that is not really as threatening as the title. It is rumored that the song is directed at Roxy Music's Brian Ferry. It starts out with a drumming akin to martial parade music. It combines a number of musical and  vocal styles in its short 4 minutes twenty seconds. Musically in ends somewhat dissonantly.           \\"Some of Them Are Old\\" has somewhat of a Victorianesque and  is sung  by Eno  with an intonation reminiscent of the Beatles. He is accompanied by a choir in the background.The song then goes into an instrumental featuring a steel guitar which  melodically squeals  back and forth.  The guitar is joined with the swell of organ music and a return of the  lyrics sung now more strongly  vaguely reminiscent of church  music.           The album concludes with the song \\"Here Come the Warm Jets\\" and is mostly an instrumental of lightly  high  buzzing guitars that give somewhat of a humming sound. Near the end of it we can here Eno in the background faintlysinging.Some of the lyrics of this  song have actually been forgotten by Eno himself!        For some reason although the movie \\"Velvet Goldmine\\" was based loosely on the  early career on David Bowie many of the songs from that movie were from this album.    A very strange and beautiful rock album.    Jim Connell  \\"Hallstatt Prince\\"
0316168815|4.0|I was told to read this book by many. It did keep me interested but was somewhat dissapointed in the ending. I felt as though the reader is left hanging for a point but I guess we are supposed to reflect on this. Also was somewhat of a downer.Coming out as a movie next year- so should be interesting to see how they tell the story on screen.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Considering the fact that I've never been enthralled with the enigmatic Howard Hughes and the fact that Leonardo diCaprio is not one of my favorite actors, I was pleasantly surprised with Martin Scorcese's THE AVIATOR.  It's a big, epic, sumptuously filmed spectacle that maintained my interest.  Scorcese smartly focuses on a definite time period in Hughes' life, and although the movie's ending seems empty and unfulfilled, the nearly three hour film is still packed with enough pathos and style to earn its critical kudos and its five Oscars.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett who won a supporting actress Oscar wisely chooses not to \\"imitate\\" the legendary Katherine Hepburn, but using mannerisms and voice inflections, she brings us a startingly realistic portrait of this venerated star.  Leo does incredibly well overall, but there were times when I found him to be posturing rather than acting, and while impressed with his performance, a stronger actor may have made Howard a little more empathic.  A little more understanding of how he developed his obsessive-compulsive behavior may have benefitted the film as well.  The rest of the cast is excellent:  Alan Alda in his Oscar nominated role as Senator Bennett is brilliant; John C. Reilly as Hughes' financial manager is also very good as always.  Jude Law shows up as Errol Flynn, but isn't a major part of the film; I was disappointed in Kate Beckinsale's turn as Ava Gardner.  Beckinsale certainly has the physical voluptuousness of Gardne, but her performance was merely eye candy with little depth.  Gwen Stefani's brief appearance as Jean Harlow was better than Beckinsale's.<br /><br />Overall, though, this movie is a fine example of quality film-making including its soaring score by Oscar winner Howard Shore, the cinematography, sets, and costumes.  THE AVIATOR is a good representation of both Scorcese's prowess and epic Hollywood film making.
B0007XT87G|5.0|I picked this album up with some others- and well, I listen to this one the most BY FAR- in fact, This CD might be the best prog rock I have ever heard!!!!! Simply Astonishing, Beautiful music. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!
B00097A5I6|2.0|I'm one of the biggest Oasis fans out there.  I own all the albums, all the singles, and all the DVDs.  I can play all their popular songs on guitar.  I've even got tickets for their tour this fall.  <br /> <br />BUT, this new CD does not do it for me.  Call me old school, but I'm not liking this new Oasis.  I think the druming is simplistic... same repetitive beat beat beat in Lyla and Mucky Fingers.  The only good song is Let There Be Love.  I certainly hope the new B-sides of this album sound like the old Oasis. <br /> <br />Now, I'm kinda disappointed in their fall concert.  Because I know the majority of the songs will probably be from this new album.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|This is a terrific film. The art work is much better than the original which I also admired. The story isn't much but the story of Ghost 1 is really a \\"borrowed\\" version of Neuromancer with some Blade Runner and Brazil thrown in--which is fine. I use it for class for that reason. Just don't underestimate this film.
0385512058|4.0|This book is a refreshing view of networking and is filled with innovative techniques that Ferrazzi has proven successful. However, it is much like reading a repair manual. To get the most out of this book I had to employ Ferazzi's excruciating practice of making endless notes and lists to keep my thoughts straight. Iview it as a manual rather than a novel. Either way, its content is sure to pay dividends.
B00000JCOV|5.0|i quit listening to metal the year 1993 in 11th grade, like early Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Rollins Band, Pantera. Then in 1999 i heard a Slipknot video and it rekindled my love of metal instantly. Although NOT DEATH METAL, the influence is evident, however it is mixed with trible style drums and an \\"urban\\" sensibility, the results of the which give a distinct style of brutally hard-rocking and hard-driving aural assault; it's unique and can't be pigeonholed. Some criticize the guitarists for not being virtuosos, but they miss the point with Slipknot music.
B0007PAMEM|5.0|Combining live performances from Tina's solo years is a brilliant idea because Tina is at her best when she is performing live.  She is definitely a great video star but her live performances are excellent both visually and musically.   <br /> <br />Most of these performances are selected from a 15 year period from 1985 to 2000.  However, they come together seamlessly as if it's one performance.  Never throughout the video do you see Tina's energy weaken.  In fact, you will notice that by 2000, Tina's show is bigger and better than ever.   <br /> <br />This is a modestly-priced collection and worth every penny!
B00080ZG10|5.0|Portraying the life of a man larger than life is indeed a daunting task, but in this movie Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio succeed admirably.  Many people today are unaware of the details of Howard Hughes' life and this movie brings a new generation up to speed on the highs and lows of this brilliant man.  At first I thought that DiCaprio was an odd choice to portray the eccentric millionaire, but as the movie progresses, DiCaprio seems to grow into the role.  Hughes was a man who admitted to no impossibilities once he made up his mind to do something.  Whether it was producing a ridiculously over-budget movie or designing a plane that seemed doomed to failure, he never gave up in the face of overwhelming odds.  He seemed fascinated with Hollywood movie stars and the depiction of his relationship with Katherine Hepburn (played with uncanny accuracy by Cate Blanchett)is a high point in the film.  Unfortunately the demons of obsessive-compulsive disorder ultimately overcame his brilliance, and the movie accurately depicts his descent into madness.  This is a fascinating and well-made biopic.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|When I first saw the previews for this on the television, I honestly did not know what to expect, was not too sure whether the movie would even be close to good. After the first night I saw it, I came out of the movie theater with shock, speechless almost to not even know what to say. Whether you wonder if it is a scary movie, you might say it can and it can't. It is scary in the sense that it could be something that could actually occur in life, so that's a scary way to look at it. But if you think that there might be some psycho killer out on the loose killing people, complete opposite. <br /> <br />A movie about two men trapped inside what appears to be a bathroom/cell, chained to pipes with nothing but clues and messages about how their lives and the lives of their loved ones being endangered. As the movie plays out, the story unfolds, while an obsessed ex-detective searches for the \\"Jigsaw killer\\"... The movie is intense and the suspense drives the movie until the very end. A very good movie if you want to be on the edge of your seat.
B00097A5I6|1.0|Shocking. How shocking? Imagine you are reading AA Milne out loud to your youngster and the text has Christopher Robin ask Piglet where Winnie the Pooh is, and Piglet yanks down Christopher's shorts and says: \\"Well, he's not here!\\" That kind of shocking. I can't believe this band dusted down the hoariest of blues riffs for Lyla. David Bowie ripped that one off thirty years ago for 'Jean Genie'. And as for Let There Be Love, why not go the whole hog and call it Let It Be Love. Or better still, Let It Be Love Which As You Know, Is All You Need. <br /> <br />Oasis showcased these songs on the telly the other night. Noel was pretentiously slouching in a chair. But he betrayed his true feelings when he was at the mike. Couldn't raise his eyes from the floor. The word I'm searching for is furtive. Makes me think of rabbits, that word. You know, FURtive. Speaking of bunnies, this is like a magician reaching for one in his hat only to come out clutching a wet turd that says to him: \\"Let me go. You ain't got the magic anymore and you stink!\\" Or to put it another way, Christopher Robin is walking with Eeyore in the Hundred Acre Wood and asks him what he thinks of the latest Oasis album. \\"EeyAWFUL! EeyAWFUL!\\" Bleats the stuffed donkey jumping up and down. Pooh bear would probably like it because he's easily led.
B000060OFT|1.0|This rendition of Shakespear's masterpiece is a bitter failure. The dialogue was awkwardly American. De Caprio has no business as Romeo. He has the look but not the artistic elegance. Danes is simply not attractive, but at least some of her lines were done with style and emotion. So, what's the bottom line? This remake was a mistake. The 1968 version is pure magic. I know the film was catering to the MTV generation, but it simply did not work. In fact, it failed miserably.

B0007M22TI|3.0|I saw this on PBS and was unfortunately struck by the \\"theatrical\\" performances of the women.  Particularly annoying was the blond fiddler, who seemed to strut, overact with her body, and look directly into the camera saying \\"Yes, I'm beautiful, and I know you want me, so by this DVD\\".  Cloying is the word I'd use. <br /> <br />Some of the other performers seemed slightly smug, or overly coached on how to emote their songs.  Probably the best of the lot was the blond singer who sang \\"She moved through the Fair\\". <br /> <br />I just listened to the cd online, and, had I only heard it, without the \\"performances\\", I'd likely have bought it. <br /> <br />But now, I don't care to join the rush to the new celtic Spice Girls ensemble.  The performance I saw felt totally contrived, packaged, and marketed.

014028009X|5.0|In one of those coincidence thingies, both this book and the movie landed on my desk at the same time.  Recognizing a sign when I saw one, I started with the book, seeing that it was written before the movie, and things should, after all, go in their natural order.<br /><br />The first thing I had to do was go back in time a bit and try to remember my tables, when I realized that the little notations like 8st 11 were references to weight.  After spending a few moments contemplating the complexity of 14 times tables, I took out my calculator to work out that Bridget weighed 129 lbs at the first chapter.  This I thought was perfectly normal for a healthy young woman, and tried to remember if I had weighed that little at birth.<br /><br />Fast forwarding to the summary of this outrageously funny book, I can tell you that it is about the hilarious episodes that led to Bridget Jones drinking 3,836 units of alcohol, smoking 5,277 cigarettes, eating 11,090,265 calories, gaining 72 lbs and losing 73 within a calendar year.<br /><br />Laid out in the format of entries in a diary (hence the title - duh), we get the privilege of following every calamity and crisis of her romantic life (mostly pitiful), her weight swings (ongoing), her mother's midlife crisis (v.g.), her neurotic friends and their problems (numerous), her job exploits (unimpressive), her weakness for gambling on scratch cards (improvement required) and her cooking skills (non existent)<br /><br />Once you pick it up you'll want to finish it in one sitting, and I was laughing out loud without even caring that people were beginning to edge away from me. (not so good).  Just when you think you have the measure of the book, it picks up the pace in the last chapters, and turns into a madcap romp of pure reading pleasure.<br /><br />Highly recommended for everyone except males with commitment problems, those dreadful people who can eat all they want without gaining weight, and European con men.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, June 4, 2005> <br />Amanda Richards, June 4, 2005 <br />
B0002X314C|1.0|I think this is a waste of money and music what are the producer doing these days and the radio plays the song like it is a hit I wonder is the radio station getting \\"PAID\\" to play another weak and lame song.  And I heard a interview with john legend and he is talking about doing acting and I'am like why is he going to mess up a movie like that. I wonder what is a real producer these days and where is the music because this is a perfect reason why the industry is all sold out with some lame hook or song. This was the gayest CD I ever heard I do not recommend only body to buy this crap. You will be sorry.
B000001FSP|4.0|I had forgotten all about this album until recently when a leading US business magazine recommended Marianne Faithfull's newest CD, Before the Poison, as a worthwhile listen. When I ordered that, I ordered Broken English as well. <br />The first time I heard Broken English years ago I liked it, but had in the back of my mind the idea it might be the last gasp of a wallowed-out, washed-up one hit wonder who is but one musical footnote to the many musical footnotes to the sixties. But now that Faithfull is back with an acclaimed release, her back catalogue deserves another listen. <br />One run through this CD, and you will hear that Marianne Faithfull is indeed a woman with attitude, the PJ Harvey of her generation. While not every song on Broken English is anywhere near a masterpiece, it is a CD that is sure to grow on you. My favorites are the title cut, The Ballad of Lucy Jordan, a sneering, mocking rendition of John Lennon's sardonic Working Class Hero, and the album's tour-de-force, Why D'Ya Do It? That last song is a woman's graphic expression of anger at being cheated on. Faithfull's snarling delivery makes me glad I'm not her target. <br />Forget about her version of the Stone's hit As Tears Go By. Listen to this, Faithfull will surprise you. And if you like your favorite female singers earthy and gritty, you are bound to like this. Check it out!
B00005JNDZ|2.0|The Edge of Reason was painful to watch for me, as I enjoyed the first Bridget Jones film quite a bit. But here there were so many requirements lacking that I nearly nodded off. A plot would've been nice (instead of wandering around from a skydiving incident to a jail in Thailand); I don't consider a \\"misunderstanding\\" about a woman a viable plot device. Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth, whom I thought had a sparky relationship in the first film, have been turned into screenplay robots, reading their lines as if directly from the page.<br /><br />The only saving grace in the story was Hugh Grant (and believe me, I'm not a huge Hugh Grant fan). When he finally showed up in the picture he immediately added some much needed dialogue-infused comedy to the story. And he delivered his lines as if he MEANT them.<br /><br />The sad part for me, too, is that I really like Mrs. Zellweger and Mr. Firth as actors. Renee was excellent in the musical \\"Chicago\\"; and Mr. Firth's crowning achievement (\\"Pride and Prejudice\\") has yet to be rivaled for a period piece in my humble opinion.<br /><br />I feel that this film was simply a money-grab by the movie studio, trying to benefit off of the success of its predecessor ...and failing miserably.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I have recently been introduced to this terrific band by a friend who wisely had me listen to their albums in chronological order. I liked Pablo Honey. I loved The Bends and every subsequent effort. This band is a rarity--each album gets not only better but progressively complex and meaningful. This album is a work of art, a masterpiece, the culmination so far of some great work!
B00008OLIO|5.0|The time:1982. What was up in the music industry lately? Disco was dead,hard rock groups from the 70's such as KISS,Aerosmith,Van Halen,among others,were still popular;however,people were wanting a new genre of music. So,in the early 80's,even though hair metal bands like Ratt and Dokken were showing up and giving people a good time,one of the first(and definitely one of the best)hair metal groups that would give people a good time during that decade was Motley Crue. This album,for some reason,is controversial among several Crue fans,but it is one heck of a debut album-especially for a hair metal band. Read on for my review of this:    This album gave Motley Crue a really good introduction. When they started out,they all proved to be talented-the only problem was that they wore makeup,and it seemed like they were trying to hard to be like KISS(the makeup Tommy Lee was wearing at that point was similiar to Peter Criss'\\"Catman\\" makeup in KISS). Other than that,everything here was really in top form. The album opens with \\"Live Wire\\",which is an awesome way to open an album,and the other highlights to be found here are the title track,\\"Piece Of Your Action\\",\\"Take Me To The Top\\"...there are so many great tracks here,it is hard to pick favorite songs off of this record after You've picked \\"Live Wire\\"and \\"Piece Of Your Action\\" as your first two favorites! The songwriting here is really good..the only Crue members who co-wrote the songs on this record are Vince Neil and Nikki Sixx,although Sixx wrote most of the material on here by himself(Neil and Sixx wrote only two songs on here together;the rest of the songs here were wither written by either just Sixx or a guy who is credited in the liner notes as \\"L. Grey\\"). The performances here are really good,Vince Neil(in my opinion)is one of the greatest rock and roll frontmen of all time,and this album gave him the opportunity to show off his singing talents professionally for the first time. Nikki Sixx proved to be a talented songwriter with this record and a talented bassist(his bass work on \\"Live Wire\\" shreds!!!!)and Tommy Lee and Mick Mars,while they had the least amount of contributions to this record,did a really good job with showing off their talents for the first time like Vince Neil and Nikki Sixx did here.Also,the production here sounds really good;Michael Wagner,who worked with some German bands(as both a songwriter and a band member)who would later go on to produce Warrant's third album,1992's \\"Dog Eat Dog\\"(which was a little bit of a hair metal album and an album that was both hard and dark)helped produce this album.I've only heard two albums that Wagner worked on(this and \\"Dog Eat Dog\\")but I must say,he sure does have talent as a producer.    As a bonus for this album,it has been re-issued and re-released with expanded liner notes,an enhanced CD that includes the music video for \\"Live Wire\\",and four bonus tracks were included here:two previously unreleased demos(an original song called \\"Toast Of The Town\\" and a cover of The Raspberries' \\"Tonight\\",an alternate intro for the title track off of this album,and the live version of \\"Merry Go-Round\\"(another song that appeared on this album)that Motley Crue recorded live in San Antonio,Texas sometime either before or after this album came out,as well as another song that did not make it's way on this album;\\"Stick To Your Guns\\".    A classic album,and an album that deserves to be heard by all fans of both Motley Crue and hair metal music.
0316776963|4.0|I read one of Sedaris' short stories in my freshman english class and I couldnt wait to read the rest of the book, but I didnt get to it until two years later and I think that turned out to be a good thing. Sedaris' type of humor is one that takes a certain amount of maturity and wit to understand. \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" was the best story to me just because I could completely relate to his experiences in his French class. For a book to make me laugh out loud in a public place is enough for me to recommend it to everyone. Not all of the stories were as funny as others but I still appreciated them.
B00097A5I6|1.0|Definitely Maybe and What's the Story(Morning Glory) were classics! This one really sounds like horrible old car! <br /> Don't believe that Oasis is good anymore!
B000002NIW|3.0|My introduction to the Deftones was back in 97 when this album came out. They had this whole thing about them on MTV and i was intrigued by their heavy and obnoxious sound.  <br /> <br />All this band does is scream and moan. But that's what's great. If you don't like stuff that's pretty obnoxious, you won't like this. But once you get passed the teenage angst sound coming from the room upstairs, then you can get into the sheer beauty. <br /> <br />Chino is a great singer and sounds genderless, if that doesn't sound too strange. But sometimes he just sings much too sensually for his own good, which makes the music come off as too indulgant in...heck, I don't know, but I don't feel like a man listening to it. <br /> <br />It's a short album and the recording is a little bit annoying, but it pays off.  <br /> <br />I could say so much about this album and I'm afraid I'll forget something, but I hate writing long reviews.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, if you like heavy music with amazing melody, rap-metal, stuff like that, basically all the stuff that's out now that sucks, only these guys can actually pull it off.  <br />And even if you don't like this album, check out their new stuff. SOMETHING of these guys has got to give! <br />They're one of my favorite bands just because of how consistent they've remained over the years and how they're not afraid to do what they really want to do and don't appeal to the masses. <br /> <br />P.S. don't listen to the Finnish guy with the one star review. If you look at all the reviews he's given, he has like ten full pages of things that he gave a one star review. The only thing that he gave a five star review was a hammer. He loved the hammer.
B0002MPQ32|5.0|This L.P and \\"Letter from home\\" and \\"We live here\\" Are my Fav. P.M. Recordings to be sure. They have the classic P.M. Jazz Signature yet they are somehow more emotionally uplifting in an intelectual and international sense. This albums cuts will rise and surges then gently concide revealing a smart melodic jazzy melody. It's P.M. Clean, with moving in rhythms and voicing. The First cut (of this L.P.) is also to be found on an excellent concert DVD \\"We Live here\\" which I own as well as the Dvd \\"Speaking of Now\\" Which are both very good.  Life Talking is like a collection of musical conversations that are so clean as to reflect a high-brow effect yet still remaining cozy and warm without being at all sappy or soft.  There's 7 Cuts as outlined;<br /><br />Minuano: is a dreamy tune at first that livens up in the middle.<br /><br />So it May secretly begin: is the essence of smooth modern cocktail jazz.<br /><br />Last train Home: has an americana feel to it.<br /><br />It's Just Talk: has a carefree but sofistcated brazillian flair and voice that meet new york.<br /><br />Third wind: hits the ground running with P.M. pick'in and grin'in like...California goes south of the border.<br /><br />Distance: I'm drifting in a fusion jungle<br /><br />In Her Family: Is like a meloncholly bed time story that pulls at your heart... like peter pan feeling depressed.<br /><br />These are great smooth jazz cuts with definite moods attached to them, no questionable feelings here.
068484267X|5.0|I figured I would pick this book up since I will be living in Ireland for one year. Of course, this book is a very different Ireland from today, but I figured it would answer question's about this generation, and that time. <br /> <br />It's told from the perspective of Frank McCourt. The book stretches from the time he's three, to the time he's 16. They move back to Ireland when he's 4 years of age and into even worse poverty than they were in when they lived in New York. <br /> <br />The book is not as bleak and awful as I thought it would be. Maybe it's pretty bad and i'm a moron, but I imagined a pretty dark book. <br /> <br />Even through the darkness of the book, McCourts humor rings through it in how he perceived things as a child. The dialogue is wonderful. If not made up, it's very captivating. <br /> <br />The people that come into little Frank's life are just one jerk or old witchy broad after another, or one Pious schoolmaster or Priest after another. The place he lives is very religious and traditional to the point where McCourt is led to beleive he's doomed to hell for his petty little sins. <br /> <br />HIs alcoholic father is portrayed in such a way that I felt awfully sorry for him and actually sort of liked him! THis is despite the fact that he sells the remains of their dead son so he can have money for beer, and despite the fact that he works day in and day out only to spend everything on alchohol till they have absolutely no food, and even despite the fact that he goes to England to find a good paying job, but never sends them back any money! Despite all of this, I REALLY wanted to see his father pull through because he's such a warm and loving character even if he's off his rocker and a total loser. <br /> <br />There are so many bad echoes of Frank's past in this book, but i was so intrueged by his style of telling it, as though you know something better is coming.  <br /> <br />The title, I imagine, probably refers to all the children their family loses throughout the corse of the book; another devestating aspect of the family life. <br /> <br />I'm reading \\"T'is\\" right now, which is the sequel to this book, and I love it even better than this book! I can't wait to finish it and I can't wait till \\"The Teacher Man\\" comes out in November.
B000021YQV|5.0|When comparing this to their new album Mesmerize, I realize that Toxicity blows it away.  It was no wonder why this album sold millions of copies worldwide.  All four members of the band are at the top of their game in this album.  Going from the very political Prison Song to the melodic hit Aerials, the album is very varied and shows how SOAD is not consistent.  It's a good thing that the guitarist, Daron Malakian, didn't sing on this one leaving Serj to be in all of his glory.  However, his guitar playing on this one is quite good.  The bass just chugs the songs along and the drumming is amazing and crazy.  There a couple of weaker spots on this album I have to admit like X, Jet Pilot, and Shimmy, however the highlights, including the melodic climax and my favorite SOAD song Chop Suey, the amazing title track, Forest, and the ender, Aerials clearly make up for that.  If you want to get into System of A Down, this should undoubtedly be your first album to get.
0694003611|2.0|I bought this because it was so highly recommended here and by some other parents, but I am disappointed.  We've had it for two years now, my son is now 2 1/2.  I've tried to follow the cadence, which is awkwardly combined with the flow of page turning. The illustrations are amateurish and boring.  (Who leaves a bowl full of mush to sit in the bedroom overnight?)  Sorry, This book just doesn't click for us.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Let me start of by saying that almost all of my favorite songs did not hit me with much impact upon the first listening. I think most can agree that it takes time to pick up on and gain a sense of an overall composition especially music with a broad melodic canvas. That being said, I find 4-5 listens as a good guide for me to gain an overall sense of a song or album - that was of course until I heard THE WAY UP. This ONE song runs 68 minutes. Needless to say after repeated listens, I was still a little lost. I can't emphasize enough, there's a lot to take in here. I bought the album when it first came out and had tickets to see PMG for the second show of their current tour in Toronto. Two weeks before the show, I buckled down and listed to The Way Up the entire time. The timing was perfect because it hit me about a day before the show and then to see them play it live just added and expanded the whole experience. Truly, one of the best and most ambitious PMG albums to date, but bear in mind, this album is not for the impatient. I think that was one of the themes of this album (judging from what I've read from the web site) - a protest against the 'sound bite'. This song is like a great book... with every listen you pick up something new or gain a new understanding and appreciation that underlines what you knew before.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Don't hesitate to have a copy of this album. It's the best in the market right now. Great album, Mariah. Keep going!!
B00097A5I6|2.0|If you are looking for an album as good as Definately Maybe then you should look elsewhere.  This album, though it took so long, sounds rushed, half hearted and very patchy.  Listening to it as a whole album it sounds like a bad compilation of outtakes, and when listening to the songs individually to pull out good points, it is a difficult task.  It has a couple of singles on it but nothing more.  Lyla is classic Oasis and made me rush to the shops to buy this album, but have decided to go back to The first 3 to try and reconvince myself how good this band actually are.
B00062J00S|5.0|George Bailey (James Stewart) gives up his dreams of world travel to run the family business, a little bank that just manages to survive by making home loans to the poor.  When catastrophe strikes and it seems that he will lose everything, he despairs, only to have divine providence step in to show him how valuable his life and struggle has been for so many people.      This film has an innocence and exuberance that transcends any charges of schmaltz, sentimentality, or cheesiness that may understandably be leveled against it.  We follow the trajectory of George's life through his youth, his marriage to his high school sweetheart (Donna Reed), and his position as a community leader who is the only buffer between the people and the rapacious Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the richest man in town.  James Stewart gives a truly great performance, believably portraying George Bailey both as a man who inspires the affection of his community and one whose disillusionment and fear drive him into a personal hell from which suicide seems the only escape.  The term \\"heart-warming\\" was probably coined just to describe the finale of this film./
0385510454|3.0|This page turner mystery kept my interest, but was much slower than a typical John Grisham book.  The focus on one main character and one primary location was different from the usual fast pace of names and locations in other Grisham mysteries.  Still, it was full of intrigue and was not overly predictable.  The main character was very likeable under pressure and the scenary was fantastic.
B0007GAEW6|1.0|well, i don't know what exactly to say about this album. it's just bad, and not just mediocore it's really bad. i can barely get through this grotesque monster of an album. i guess if you throw a bunch of wierd noises and half baked ideas together into really long songs you are instantly a genius. i have no problem with wierd music but this just isnt music, it's a crappy jam band dumped into a vat of toxic waste. If you want to listen to some good, wierd music listen to bands like can, captain beefheart, the fiery furnaces, or just about anything else.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|My step-dad said I had to watch this \\"f***ing\\" hilarious movie...well, I did, and I could not stomach anymore of it after about 30 minutes of aggonizing terror!!  Terrible...stupid...not funny at all....sorry!! <br /> <br />Christopher Berry
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|There are a few minor problems with Mezmerize, as with most CDs. The lyrics, which were often deep, poetic, and thoughtful on Toxicity, and now more silly and crazy than anything else. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's too bad that Serj or Daron didn't write anything as eloquent and moving as Aerials or Atwa for Mezmerize. The disc is too short, as many have noted, clocking in at under 40 minutes. Yeah, yeah, I know it's only Part 1 of a double album, but that doesn't mean it has to be this quick. And to conclude my nitpicks, Serj doesn't get to sing nearly enough. He really is a better, more interesting vocalist than Daron, as anyone can hear by popping in Toxicity. Judging by the fact that Daron is now listed first in the band credits (Serj was first in the Toxicity booklet), maybe he's just on a bit of an ego trip. We'll see if Serj takes back the mic in November when Hypnotize comes out. <br /> <br />But those small problems aside, Mezmerize is awesome. When you listen to rock radio today, you hear dreary sludge. You hear corporate, lifeless, Viacom-owned stations relentlessly playing 15-year-old songs into the ground (New rock! Welcome to the Jungle! New rock! Come As You Are! New Rock! Big Empty!). Or, on the rare occasion they play rock that really is new, it is completely bland, generic, ball-less crap like Shinedown or Three Days Grace or Linkin Park. But then you listen to System of a Down and they blow you away with their creativity and goofiness and sheer intensity. Mezmerize is what modern rock should be but barely ever is - bold, daring, fast, interesting, and really fun to listen to. <br /> <br />Whether spitting out ferocious metal riffs in the lead single BYOB or harmonizing on the polka-like Radio/Video, System of a Down almost always succeed in whatever they attempt. They can kick up a frenzied headbanging storm and sing catchy melodies on the same record. They are a fresh, invigorating, versatile band, and they're not afraid to push ahead, take risks, and try new things. As stagnant as \\"rock\\" has become these days, SOAD has found ingenious ways to breathe some much-needed life back into the music industry. Top tracks are B.Y.O.B., Revenga, This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song (great title), Violent Pornography, Question!, and Old School Hollywood. <br /> <br />All in all, an excellent record. Hats off to System of a Down for making some \\"new rock\\" that's worth listening to.
B00009RDG9|3.0|I have been on an action kick lately and I cant get enough of them...came across this little piece of work while at work at the local video store... <br />All other reviews have pretty much nailed this one on the head.  Lots of action, but some of the acting is kinda lame.  Be prepared to watch lots of blood flow in this one!! With the material that both actors had to work with, I think that this was a good attempt on all accounts!  <br /> <br />Christopher Berry
B00021TLDO|1.0|That other guy doesn't know what he is talking about.  This is not the REAL Star Wars.  I mistakenly purchased these videos and found out that they have all the horrible added scenes and Lucas \\"special touches\\".  Do not buy this if you are looking for the untouched version of Star Wars!
B00000I14Z|5.0|I think this is my favorite Mingus album. It's got it all - wonderful tunes and virtuoso performances. But where do you go from here? Mingus put out a lot of amazing music. Some of it is rather challenging and not for the timid, but I recommend the following without hesitation, especially if you're a fan of Mingus Ah Um. <br /> <br />Blues and Roots, Mingus Dynasty - both also from 1959, one of his greatest years, Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus - just spectacular, Tijuana Moods - one his most emotional and swinging albums, Black Saint and the Sinner Lady - one of the most daring (yet swinging) jazz concept albums, Let My Children Hear Music - a true masterpiece of composition and performance, and Live in Antibes - one of his best live albums featuring Eric Dolphy.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Toxicity deserves 5 stars for it is a flawless album. SOAD's latest Mezmerize is a strong follow-up to Steal this Album but there is one glaring fault: Daron Malakian's \\"vocals\\". Why couldn't they have just left well enough alone. Serj Tankian's vocals command the listeners attention and truly mezmerize the listener. The addition of Malakian's screams simply make Mezmerize less of an accomplishment than it should have been. It's like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa, it's just unnecessary. The album as a whole is musically strong enough to survive Malakian's butchering of the vox. His guitar playing more than compensates for his lack of talent on the mic. Songs like Sad Statue, B.Y.O.B, Revenga, Question and This Cocaine are what SOAD fans have waited with baited breath for and these tracks deliver the goods. However, songs like Radio/Video, Violent Pornography and Lost in Hollywood are truly ruined by their inane lyrics and almost annoying stanzas. Old School Hollywood is hilarious, taking swipes at Tony Danza, the American Pastime and Frankie Avalon. I mean how many people would have ever thought that Frankie Avalon's name would ever be uttered by Serj much less part of a song chorus. But that's what makes Mezmerize a success, the appearance of the unexpected. Musically SOAD has continued to grow and expand their sound. I just hope they don't become softer and more palatable for mainstream America. Lyrically, I get the innuendos and sarcasm but still there's some room for growth. Overall, a must-own for the serious metal or SOAD fan but PLEASE DARON...NO MORE VOCALS!!! Recommended.
B000002AGN|5.0|Of course this is one of the greatest jazz albums of all time. What's sad to me is that people stop here. They get Time Out and Kind of Blue by Miles Davis and don't pick up another jazz CD. But there are dozens of amazing albums by both these artists, not to mention several hundred truly great jazz albums by other artists if you take the time to explore.  <br /> <br />But if you like Time Out you might also enjoy these others by Brubeck: <br /> <br />The Great Concerts - A high-energy live collection, Time Further Out - expanding on the time theme, Jazz Impressions of Eurasia and Jazz Impressions of Japan - both classics with wonderful tunes, Brubeck Time - Dave's first studio album with Columbia and, believe it or not, Dave Digs Disney - just marvelous, and So What's New - all new compositions from 1997. You can't go wrong with any of these. In fact Dave is still going strong at age 85. He's also amazing in concert.  <br /> <br />Even though Time Out, recorded in 1959 (possibley the gratest year for recorded Jazz), is one of the truly great jazz albums, don't stop there. Make it your starting point for a lifetime adventure of listenting to jazz.
0671015206|5.0|Recently, my financial advisor gave me THE MILLIONAIRE NEXT DOOR to read when I started expressing serious concerns about not being able to sustain myself financially (I'm young and just became self-employed).  I just finished reading it, and thought it was not only inspiring (on an emotional level), but fascinating as well.  I think everyone in my family became sick from me quoting this book every five seconds.  I couldn't help it; there were some interesting tidbits about accumulating financial independence that I hadn't thought about.  I'd always known a car or clothes don't equal a person's financial status, but this book help cement the reality of it.  What I thought even more interesting were the chapters on adult children who are always getting cash gifts from parents (there is nothing to be jealous about!).   <br /> <br />Regarding those same children, I loved this quote in the book: \\"Consider for a moment that you are a typical affluent parent.  You noted that your oldest son or daughter even at an early age was extremely independent, achievement-oriented, and well-disciplined.  Your instinct is to nurture these traits by not trying to control his or her decisions.  Instead, you spend more time helping your less resourceful child make decisions, or you actually make decisions for him.  With what result?  You strengthen the strong child and weaken the weak.\\"  That is so true of my family!  And it goes beyond financial support to emotional and mental as well!   <br /> <br />Anyway, I felt this book was eye-opening - as well as a good choice on my financial advisor's part in perking me up and letting me see that I'm on the \\"right\\" track.  It also gave me some options I hadn't thought of before.  I think I'm going to buy my siblings their own copies ofthis book for Christmas.   <br />
B0002EXH54|5.0|This album came out in 1986 and is truely one of the greatest as far as thrash metal goes.  Its somewhat political and has strange lyrics.  Anyone who likes metal and/or likes metal from the 80s should pick this up.  The songs are as follows:  Wake Up Dead is a great song.  The video is great also.  The guitars are heavy and at the end of the song, the sorta slow riff is awesome, and a guitar with a sweet solo comes in.  The Conjouring is pure madness.  Peace Sells is easily the best song on the album.  Great opening bass.  Guitars are great.  Awesome lyrics.  Next is Devils Island.  This song is weird because the chorus is consisted on only 2 words repeated.  Still a great song and helps the album remain fast and heavy.  Good Mourning/Black Friday I think adds the rawness to the album.  A lot of people like this one.  Bad Omen is what you listen to when you want to listen to sweet guitars.  Easily the worst song on the album.  I Ain't Superstitious is a great song.  Love to opener.  Last is My Last Words.  Great closer.  I listen to this almost daily.  Truely great overall song.  So overall, this is a great album and highly recommended.  Worth some space on your shelf.
B0007XT87G|2.0|I own every CD of this band (if you want to call it a real band, more like Steven Wilson with blind followers) oh yes, I own every CD since \\"Signify.\\" That's quite a few. I enjoyed \\"Stupid Dream\\" & \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" for what they were worth...somewhat experimental rock (though I am not a big Pink Floyd fan, in fact I think Floyd sucks). Then Pork Tree made the leap to a major subsidized label. Congratuations! <br /> <br />It seems somewhat coincidental that they cut a heavier album and got the openning slot for the Dream Theater tour (sound accidental, not really). I liked \\"In Absentia\\", I even bought it in 5.1 also!  <br /> <br />\\"Deadwing\\" - first it is allegedly related to some horror story nobody has ever heard of - there's the first sighting of a comprimised album of songs. The CD also is enchanced and claims to have stuff on it \\"only available on the CD\\" which is bulls**t because its nothing more than B-roll from the studio also available on their website, which sort of gives you an example of how casually aimless they can be.  <br /> <br />Finally, they took it back down a notch as they are never going to be U.S. headliners (they can pull that off in very gay Europe) and gave us a very \\"comprimised\\" CD. It seems like they are trying too hard to keep fans in both camps (that being the the 3 CD's before In Absentia as well as In Absentia itself).  <br /> <br />Short cruchy songs don't make you metal and long song passages that seem to go nowhere don't make you ambient and experimental. Instead of taking another step foward (any direction would be nice) these foolios decided to take 1 & 1/2 steps backwards.  <br /> <br />If you must have some Pork Tree, simply download songs # 2, 3 & 4 (unless you can find a copy in the 99 cent bin, which should happen rather quickly). Those are the only cuts worth the crap on this CD. The rest is just basically jerking away in the studio. The nerve, expect more line up changes and poor sales = being dropped from their major label...which they will \\"play off\\" as \\"their wanting their freedom to create music they really want.\\" Yeah, that's what they all say.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This album is the heaviest of the three.  This is when they were more for the \\"heavy heavy metal' fans.  The best thing about this album is the fact that he sreams and sings.  He is truely a great singer.  I'm a metal person all the way, but some of the stuff thats out now is pure crap.  Back when this came out is when some other good stuff came out.  Bands like Strapping Young Lad is just plain out trash.  Other then the singer being half bald, the music sucks.  I dont see why people like that band.  Slipknot is for sure a different story.  I highly recommend this album to any hardcore fan.  I noticed that on my other Slipknot review, I got no good review remarks, so i'll talk more about that now.  I know that because Slipknot and Iowa was so heavy, it made Vol. 3 a dissapointment to many.  I'm more into the harder Slipknot.  It just had a lot more emotion.  As you may know the Stonesour thing is what messed up album as far as heaviness goes.  I still think Vol. 3 is a great album.  You should pick that one up to.  Now back to Slipknot.  The songs are great and worth every penny.  The enhanced version has 2 extra songs so check that out.  Heres what i did. I'm cheap so i just downloaded those 2 songs and added them to a burnt copy of \\"slipknot\\".  Hey, thats using your brain.
0596007124|5.0|I learned of this book through Erich Gamma's mention in an interview.  I figured if Erich (father of design patterns) liked it, it was worth looking at.  What I found was at a totally new approach to not only design patterns, but technical writing.  Gone are page after page of straight text and dry diagrams.  In their place are useful and fun diagrams, storylines, interesting examples and even some dry humor (which I rather enjoyed). <br /> <br />I'm not a stranger to design patterns, but reading this book was both entertaining and informative (I learned a thing or two).  It would make a wonderful introductory text on design patterns, or even for seasoned professionals it is a fun way to spend a couple evenings.
B000002UDD|5.0|This album came out in the same year as ...And Justice For All.  Its pretty hard to determine which one is better.  I may say ...And Justice For All in that other review but it really just depends on the mood.  But if anything, this album kicks ass.  I first listened to this with a family member and I noticed the cursing so of course I took out my portable CD player.  It was in the middle of Into The Lungs Of Hell and I cant say that I listened to it much after that one time.  Set The World Afire is track 2.  I really love the raw sense in it.  Truely all metal in 80s' was raw.  Arnarchy in the U.K. is there sorta tribute to punk.  The only thing I dont get about this song is that it says U.K. but its really U.S.A. in the song.  Well we know which is better anyway. \m/ (*^*) \m/  Mary Jane is a cool song.  Not many people like it.  I dont see how.  Cool sound.  502 is a road song.  When a car tries to pass me on the road, I always speed up hoping another car will come. lol.  This song encourages me to do it over and over again.  In My Darkest Hour is the highlight of the album.  A sorta ballad you might say.  Dave at his best in writing lyrics.  Ellefson helped though.  Liar is one of my favorites in Megadeth song history.  Its great.  The ending is great with all the cursing and solo.  Hook in Mouth is great also.  Song about the P.M.R.C.  I dont undertand why dave would write a song about it but its a classic.  I would give this album 10/10.  I really enjoyed it and its good to have on the shelf.  I bet it would look great on yours too.  Highly recommended.
B000002I25|3.0|This is one of the first rock records I really got into and it has always stuck with me.  In some sense this record doesn't stand up well against time, but still has some incredible songs and is a great sampler of the Doors. <br /> <br />The strengths of this record are some of the obvious picks, with \\"Break On Through\\" and \\"Light My Fire\\" standing out as giants in modern music.  \\"The Crystal Ship\\" has always been a lesser known gem, showing Jim Morrison's range has a vocalist.   <br />The haunting organ of Ray Manzarek in \\"Back Door Man\\" proves the blues weren't dead in that time period. <br /> <br />By the end of the record, one leaves wanting more as some of the back end tracks start to sound the sound the same.  I highly recommend \\"Strange Days\\" or \\"Morrison Hotel\\" after this record.  Still this record rocks and shows the greatness of this band.
B000002UUX|5.0|ah. Its the beginning of October and you just picked up Megadeth's Rust In Peace.  You hear the opening of Holy Wars and just wonder,'how could any band be this good'.  And it will always be that.  The music might change over the years but you grow to appreciate it. Rust In Peace is truely the album of 1990.  If comparing to Metallica, you would choose the black album because it is closer to RIP's release date.  Its a no decision.  This album is flawless. Holy Wars is the best on the album mostly because of the outgoing guitars and power chords. I noticed not many people thought too much of Hangar 18.  I dont see how.  This song can single handily blow out any guitar solos by slash and to some degree hendrix.  The only thing we casual guitar players with skill greater than most is just dream we're playing that song.  Next is Take No Prisoners.  This song is my third favorite.  Its madness to an extreme.  The lyrics are to some degree set to a war tone.  If you know your world history, you know what i'm talking about. Five Magics is sorta a solo song.  There's quite a few.  I think the way the 'singing' and the guitars flow is pure metal.  Maybe not heavy heavy metal, but hard enough.  Poison Was The Cure has a slow opener and stays sorta low until 55 seconds.  The fast drums come in then.  Its a great song.  Lucretia is exactly one minute longer than PWTC.  The opener is strange but cool.  Probably the worst song on the album, but still not sorry.  Tornado of Souls is priceless.  Cool opener and lyrics, and one of the best Megadeth solos in there song history.  Dawn Patrol is really good to me.  I like the tone of it.  Its the music you like to listen to when you wanna sneak on someone.  The name of the device that turns his voice like that has escaped my mind, but you probably know what it is.  Rust in Peace...Polaris has probably the best drums on the album.  I like the way dave's voice sounds in this one.  I noticed some other dude said that his voice is bad except for Holy Wars.  Thats truely wrong.  His voice is more metal then that crap today.  60% of metal to me is defined to lyrics wise.  When you cant even understand what they're saying, it overshadows the music.  I think Slipknot is the only exception to that.  You can clearly understand Dave.  Peace Sells...But Who's Buying is the only exception.  Some songs on there are pretty fast.  So overall, this album is great and one of the few albums that are flawless and have a great album cover so 10/10 for this album.  Pick it up.  Hope this helped.
B000000H3Z|5.0|Not only are Sepultura as equally as responsible as Slayer for spearheading extreme/thrash/death metal, but Sepultura are also responsible for making \\"Beneath the Remains,\\" a landmark metal album. Sepultura's first album drew numerous comparisons to Slayer, but Sepultura definitely came into their own with this album. They still play at the speed of Slayer, but with the heaviness of Morbid Angel (a band that came after Sepultura). Scorching solos, awesome riffs, pounding drums, \\"boom boom\\" beats...these songs have everything you could as for in album from this genre. This C.D. may pick up where \\"Schizophrenia\\" left off (and is sort of like  \\"Schizophrenia, Part 2\\"), but who can complain? From the first track to the last, there isn't a single song that is filler. The aforementioned first song (the title track, which opens with an acoustic intro, ala Metallica's \\"Battery,\\" then changes gears and rockets into hyper speed) and \\"Sarcastic Existence\\" (which has a drum intro, furious double bass work, and two scorching solos from Andreas Kisser) are two of the best songs and best representations of this album. Also, make sure you get the remastered version of this album, not the original that came out in 1989. Not only is the sound quality a lot better, but the remastered version also has two extra tracks (\\"Inner Self\\" and \\"Mass Hypnosis\\") at the end, which are brilliant instrumentals.
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is a wonderful book, highly recommended.  I don't want to spend to much space here saying how great it is - you can find plenty of that anywhere you want.  Rather, I'm compelled to respond to - nay, to defend - the negative things that I've heard said about this book (which all happen to revolve around whether or not the story is believable). <br /> <br />A fellow Amazon reviewer as well as others have taken pot shots at Life of Pi's credibility, as if that were the point of the story.  But it's not just that credibility is not the point - it's that this is an issue so well explored and answered for by the author that there is nothing left to defend.  Belief, whether as an aspect of faith or an aspect of storytelling, is thoroughly accounted for throughout the novel and especially in its last pages, where a more \\"believable\\" version of the story, \\"without the animals\\" is offered to non-believers.  (My money says that it is the non-believers making their way to fill kitchen sinks to perform the banana-floatation experiments, while the believers  savor the art that Martel has created).  \\"I'm not sure a tiger would behave that way\\" and other such comments betray a tragic missing of the whole point.  In the end, there are two ways to rebuff the non-believers: you can point out to them that they are no more experts in tiger behavior than the well-researched Martel, and that, while unlikely, this story is possible (one of the reasons that it's so fascinating).  The other option is to tell them to quit quibbling over details and let the author's message speak for itself.  In Life of Pi, the message is there, and it's worth getting.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|Most of the other people supplying comments have hit this one on the head, a very good album, relaxed but not boring by any means.   <br /> <br />The closest to a top forty you are going to see is \\"Boom like that\\" but so what.  Solid album overall.  I have all his solo work and feel this is the most solid effort.  Some other albums had some killer songs but low spots as well.  This is just solid material end-to-end on this one.  <br /> <br />Very nice guitar work, songs flow well.  Knopfler fans will listen to \\"Boom like that\\", and say, \\"Yep, he's still got it\\".  \\"Don't crash the ambulance\\" has a feel of some older Knopfler and Dire Straits music, not a rip-off or copy of older stuff, and that is a good thing.  \\"Sucker Row\\" is just good stuff, nice melody, same for \\"Back to Tupelo\\".  Title song and \\"Postcards from Paraguay\\" stand out also.   <br /> <br />If you like Mark's other stuff, like I do  - - -  <br />If you like talented musicians  - - -  <br />If you like albums produced well, with a lot of nice hooks  - - - <br />- - - - - - - - you will enjoy this album.
B00097A5I6|4.0|This album is a solid effort IMHO. No album will ever replace DM or WTSMG as far as I am concerned and there in lays the problem I believe. It is so easy  to  be judgemental, I  am willing  to  bet that if this  were the first album released alot of people including editorial reviews would be declaring  this the next great band especially  based on, Let There be Love, Lyla, The Importance of Being Idle, Turn Up The Sun and Love Like a Bomb. Growing  old with  something  you  love means you are going  to lose something such as the mysteriousness that can never be regained. That  means stop judging  a person or group on the past and appreciate that life is all about change which means live in the present and appreciate same. Relationships,work and life in general change and won't be the same today as ten years ago and that is life in a nut shell. Actually  I believe Oasis by  declaring  themselve's the greatest band did set themselve's up  for a harsh back lash down the road as the saying  goes. But their music speaks for itself and I respect their attitude actually even if they  are off the cuff sometimes. Confidence is everything  in life and they can't be accused of lacking. There is enough on this album to  satisfy true Oasis fans and hopefully attract new ones. Let There Be Love has to  be one of the greatest songs they  have ever recorded, pure rock/pop bliss and as much as I love WTSMG can match any  ballad on same. To be honest I  have felt let down by some of their previous releases ie: SOTSOG, it is like we want every song  to  be a classic, that  is alot to  live up to. I  will take Oasis music any day over Cold Play. Peace Love and Empathy
1592400876|3.0|I have used that phrase previously to bemoan the lack of verity in the claims made by the TCDSB that they promote such a policy toward violence and bullying in their schools. This time, however, I found the phrase in the sub-title of a book I just finished reading. The little volume titles itself , Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation. It is written by Lynne Truss and includes a foreword by Frank McCourt, of \\"Angela's Ashes\\" fame.       The book jacket makes the somewhat difficult-to-believe claim that the work is \\"The Runaway #1 British Bestseller\\". If it is, indeed, as the jacket claims, then there are far too many Brits who need to broaden their reading horizons. I read the book because someone had loaned it to me, but if I had been expected to pay for it, then I'm afraid I simply would never have encountered its content firsthand.       There are 204 pages for you to make your way through, each one with large margins to left and right, bottom and top of the page. The font is perhaps a little larger than that of many a book, and yet, even with all of the aforementioned, the book is still too long by approximately 154 pages.       Truss does give some humourous real-life examples of the pandemic pandemonium attendant on misuse of punctuation. \\"Dicks in tray\\", for instance, can give you an idea of the mayhem that could result from a misplaced apostrophe. There were other instances, however, where the humour jumped out at me even though I don't think Truss actually intended any. The number one use of the exclamation mark, says she, is in \\"involuntary ejaculations\\". I can just picture it now ... a multitude of the little marks hovering anxiously over a conjugal bed.       Carrying on about such things as whether to place the period inside or outside a bracket, (and even whether or not to call it a bracket), or listing all 17 possible uses of the comma and 6 traditional uses of the exclamation mark just doesn't quite seem to justify thisbook's having 204 pages. Neither does it seem to be the stuff of which runaway bestsellers should be made.       There are one or two interesting little nuggets hidden in Truss' caviling and carping. She points out that punctuation as we know it (or don't know it) today, is a relative newcomer to the world of print. She gives dates and quotes from experts, such as Cassiodorus, who held forth in the 6th century. Referring to punctuation as \\"intensely powerful ju-ju\\", she talks about the earliest copies of scripture being unpunctuated, and how St. Jerome, who translated the Bible in the 4th century, \\"introduced a system of punctuation of religious texts\\". Then she directs the attention of the reader to the scene of the crucifixion, when Jesus turned to the thief at his side and made a promise. The problem is that, with the simple placement of a comma, the meaning of the passage can be dramatically altered. As Truss phrases it, \\"Huge doctrinal differences hang on the placing of this comma\\". The Protestant interpretation of the passage punctuates it thusly: \\"Verily, I say unto thee, This day thous shalt be with me in Paradise.\\" The Catholics justify their concept of Purgatory by punctuating it so: \\"Verily I say unto thee this day, Thou shalt be with me in Paradise.\\" Ju-ju, indeed!       Frank McCourt opens his foreword by saying, \\"If Lynne Truss were Catholic I'd nominate her for sainthood.\\" I don't know about that, but I do know that if you suffer from insomnia, and prefer to find remedies that don't involve pill-popping, Truss' book is the answer for you. Crack open a copy of this one, and its soporific qualities will have you somnolent in no time.    (...)
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Though I have never seen the actual show Wicked (but will be seeing it soon), I still love, love, love the songs on this CD. My favorite songs are:  1. The Wizard and I - this song is beautifully sung by Idina Menzel (Elphaba), and it tells of Elphaba's desire to fit in.  2. What is this Feeling? - this upbeat song tells of Galinda and Elphaba's initial dislike for each other. The lyrics are clever, and Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel sing their parts perfectly. I always smile when I hear Galinda say \\"My Dearest Darlingest Momsy and Popsicle\\" at the beginning of the song.  3. Dancing Through Life - this is a sweet song, and, having never seen the musical live, this was my first introduction to Nessarose, Fiyero, and Boq, and Michelle Federer sings Nessa's part perfectly.  4. Popular - this is a fun song in which Galinda describes how she's going to make Elphaba popular. Kristin Chenoweth has the perfect voice for Galinda.  5. Defying Gravity - this song's lyrics are so powerful, and Idina Menzel's captivating voice can convey so much of that power.  6. As Long as You're Mine - I love the powerful emotion in this love song between Elphaba and Fiyero  7. No Good Deed - a powerful and passionate song sung by Elphaba  8. For Good - this song has such meaningful lyrics, and Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth's voices complement each other perfectly.  The songs I listed above are my very favorites from the CD, though \\"Thank Goodness\\" and the sweet \\"I'm Not That Girl\\" are close seconds. Some of the songs, such as \\"Something Bad\\" and \\"Dear Old Shiz,\\" are songs I tend to skip over, though I do not doubt their importance in the context of the musical as a whole. I would recommend this CD to... well, everyone, especially Broadway fans, though I have friends who don't particularly like Broadway, but love the songs from Wicked. This is a CD you'll listen to over and over.    Update:  Having recently seen the musical Wicked, I found it necessary to add a bit on to this review.Seeing Wicked live is amazing - the CD is spectacular, but there's nothing like seeing the play. My one small problem with the play is that there are a few elements of the story that don't completely go with the plot of The Wizard of Oz, but I won't go into that, since explaining would include a few spoilers. The original Broadway cast is no longer performing, but Megan Hilty (Glinda) and Shoshana Bean (Elphaba) are currently performing on Broadway. Megan and Shoshana are great, even if they can't top Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth. Also, \\"I'm Not That Girl\\" and \\"Thank Goodness\\" have officially moved up onto my list of favorite songs from the musical.

B000000XCK|5.0|I am not from CCR's generation of hippies and Vietnam veterans but a twenty year old in a generation of Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys. What does this have anything to do with CCR? I don't listen to my generation's music hardly ever. I must be a born again dope smoking hippie because all I listen to is classic rock. My dad handed me down this album when I was in junior high in the late 1990s and it was my first awakening to what great music sounds like. I'm very familiar at this point with most of the music of the late 60s and 70s and I will still claim CCR's Pendumlum is one of the greatest albums of its kind from this period of rock and roll. I think what makes CCR so great is their ability to molt jamming rifts in which you can dance up and down to into sweet melodic jams in which you can chill. They do it perfectly with John Fogerty on lead guitar and his brother Tom on rhythm playing together with Stu Cook on bass and Doug Clifford on drums. I can't think of too many bands with a better combination. Pendulum is one of those albums you could probably listen to anytime of day and with any kind of mood. I guess if you're into the way harder material from that time, Pendulum might be a downer but not necessarily. I listen to Deep Purple and Zeppelin to Fleetwood Mac and Jackson Browne. I think CCR is that place in between all of these bands. I'm in love with all the songs on this album so its hard to say exactly which ones to listen to for a first glance. When I first started listening to CCR, I was definitely digging the softer sounds and the melodic tunes in music so I think I will always be more affectionate to \\"(Wish I could) hideaway\\" \\"It's just a thought\\" but jams on \\"Pagan Baby\\" and \\"Hey Tonight\\" are equally as fantastic. I know my perspective on this album compared to other CCR albums may be biased since this album was my first and it has great sentimentality attached. But there is a reason that this album converted me from the 90s back to 1970. I now listen to everything including hip hop and old country but CCR will always have me, especially this album.
B000003C5C|5.0|Finally, Death had somewhat matured since the primitive effort of 'Scream Bloody Gore'. Their second album boosts a lot better production and more skilled musicmanship. This along with Nuclear Assault's \\"Survive\\", Anacrusis' \\"Suffering Hour\\", Coroner's \\"Punishment for Decadence\\" and Testament's \\"New Order\\" are some of the best albums of that great year. <br /> <br />The brand of Thrash/Death metal offered on this release is a little bit darker than some of the other stuff at the time but still remains quite catchy. The opening track display's some of the bands more technical proficiency a la tempo changes and the time signatures the breaks are in.  <br /> <br />The guitars are wild with tons of fast speed riffs, trills and crazy solos. In places it looks like the Rozz/Schuldiner attack doesn't work, but for the most part they are a good duo. (Whatever happened to Rozz? Didn't he have a cable show or something?) The bassist has his instrument heard in the final production, but the pace he plays at always sounds like it is at 1/2 speed. Fingers not quite fast enough? Mr. Butler should've consulted Steve DiGiorgio on fast finger playing. The drums are alright and are pretty original for the time. Bill Andrews plays lots of choke-holds on the high hat which creates an interesting effect. Some of the breaks like on \\"leprosy\\" and \\"open casket\\" sound like shuffles. Definitely different than what other drummers were playing at the time. <br /> <br />Not really any bad songs on here, of course there are some songs that are definitely better than others: \\"Leprosy\\", \\"Forgotten Past\\", \\"Open Casket\\" and \\"Choke on It\\" are the best in opinion. This album also is the first to showcase Death's more progressive tendencies that would be become more pronounced in later years. This along with \\"Individual Thought Patterns\\" are my two favorite Death albums and this albums strong point is that it doesn't overuse the breaks and changeups that were to characterize albums like \\"Symbolic\\". A must have. (Goes without saying: R.I.P. Chuck)      <br /> <br />
B0000TLA9G|2.0|Guns N' Roses were such an original band.  That being said, why does their 14-track Greatest Hits album have 5 cover songs on it?  (Knockin on Heaven's Door, Live & Let Die, Ain't It Fun, Since I Don't Have U, and Sympathy For The Devil)   <br /> <br />If you are going to have 5 covers on GN'R's Greatest Hits Album, you better make it 2-Discs.  And hopefully it would include more GN'R Classics like \\"My Michelle\\", \\"Rocket Queen\\", \\"Night Train\\", \\"Used To Love Her\\" \\"Estranged\\" \\"Dead Horse\\" \\"Mr. Brownstone\\",  \\"Double Talkin' Jive\\", \\"Think About You\\" or \\"Garden Of Eden\\". <br /> <br />Save your cash and just get Appetite For Destruction, GN'R Lies, and the Use Your Illusion albums.  You'll be glad u did.
B00005JNDZ|3.0|Last time we saw her, Bridget Jones (Zellweger) was in love with Mark Darcy (Firth) and they were staying together for the movie's happy ending. Now, we find them again only a few weeks later, exactly one year after they first met in the buffet organized by Bridget's mother. And guess what, they are there again; another year, another buffet, another diary. This is how we jump into the sequel, and as usually happens, it is not as good as the original; but it still provides us with a fun time.<br /><br />Bridget is working in \\"Sit Up Britain\\" and is continuously finding herself in ridiculous situations, which do not portray her in a very flattering light, but boosts rating. As happened in the previous movie, we get to listen to her comments on the events that she is going through; comments that are usually pretty funny, but sometimes turn out to be a bit corny.<br /><br />You probably are asking yourself by now, what about Daniel (Grant)? Well, he has a TV show in the same network as Bridget, and even though she does not even want to hear about him anymore, their paths cross when they have to work together on one of the shows. And this happens right when she is thinking about marriage with Mark, but the encounter situation things a bit. And the fact that Mark is working with a very attractive woman does not help in the least.<br /><br />The movie keeps the main characteristics of the winning formula used for the first one, and yes...you will get to see another fight between Daniel and Mark, so do not worry. But some things are funnier the first time around, and that is true in this case too. The creators did add a little variety though, with a little travel that allows for a change of settings, but it is still not enough to compensate for the repeated humor.<br /><br />The cast does a very good job, especially Zellweger, who is perfect for the role and shows a clear ability for portraying a character that constantly makes a fool of herself. The soundtrack is eclectic and fits the movie well, including songs ranging from Barry White to Madonna. Finally, I need to comment on the option of watching the movie with the quiz option, since it is an annoying feature that keeps stopping the film to ask the questions. And on top of that, it has such silly options as answers that my wife decided to quit it and stick with the \\"normal\\" version of the movie. - 3.5 starsand fits the movie well, including songs ranging from Barry White to Madonna.

B00005JNBQ|3.0|watching the movie..especially if you are by yourself, is not entertaining at all..but later when you think about how silly it was, you will catch yourself laughing! plus everyone is always making refrences to the movie and if you haven't seen it, you won't understand. just watch it once!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|i love,love,love this show. the banter,the wittiness, the quirkiness of the mother and daughter team and the casts perfect for a perfect show. one of the most well written, and acted show at present. depicts the relationship of mother and daughter and the people around them. if you watched the show from 1 until the present you will see how the characters have grown. season one is the best season ever for me ,its where i got hooked and have known the characters. the pop culture references makes it more interesting. buy season one and you won't regret you ever laid eyes on it. see seasons 2 and 3 as well cuz it wouldn't be complete.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Mezmerize is a great album. I'm glad they decided to put this out, and i think it is very successful. The only reason i gave it 4 stars, is because Daron sings too much. I think he is good for back ground vocals when Serj is singing, just not by himself. Here is a song review:    Solider Side-Intro 9/10 - Its a good string way to start off this new release. Its actually part of the full song which is on Hypnotize which is out in November. For gods sake its a minute long!    B.Y.O.B 9/10 - Deserves a ten, but its been overplayed, now it is currently old. Good bouncy parts, then it explodes into a raging explanation of current events, which System is disagreeing about. It has a strong meaning about the war in Iraq. People hate the line \\"Everybody's going to the party have a real good time.\\" If you understand the correct meaning, which is everybody going into political parties and doing whatever the hell they want.    Revenga 9/10 - Tounge twisting lyrics, fast drumming, and a stylish chorus. Don't ask me why they decided to put an a in Revenge, but hey its cooler. I saw an interview with the drummer and it was funny how he had created an intro and nobody liked it. Then he told them a week later and it was the same one and they used it.    Cigaro 10/10 - If you are into funny lyrics and fast beats, this is the song to fit you. Its got cool guitar riffs here and there, and a dirty style. The first time I had ever heard this song, it was on the radio. Suprisingly, this is the song that got me into these guys. I liked this and BYOB, then gave the album a try. Loved it then went on to their other stuff. I heard great stuff about Toxicity when it came out as well.    Radio/Video 9/10 - Love the high guitar to begin the song. Its a really bouncy and happy song. It seems like they are losing they're losing their touch, but the new style is cool. The chorus gets old quickly, but the bouncy circus verses. Danny and Lisa are talked about in the song. They were good friends of Darons in high school. This was the third song on the radio.    This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song 10/10 - My favorite song on the album. It bring back chaotic memories from Self Titled. The title is the funniest thing, because the song is so out there and trippy, that actually sounds like you've just done the white gold. Great chorus with his Serj's high voice. Its fast, stellar, crazy, and stoned. The guitar is what sticks out to me in this song.    Violent Pornography 10/10 - Love it. Its got an awesome twist message. Its got bouncy pop-like verses which explode into a somewhat subliminal meaning. Then the chorus is great. I get the same feeling about Revenga at some parts. Can you say brainwashing? B-b-b-b-brainwasing...    Question! 10/10 - It has an opera like chorus with a after death meaning. It has cool acoustic verses with amazing vocal work from Serj and Daron. Cool drumming too.     Sad Statue 9/10 - The beginning sounds like BYOB. Cool drums that fill the song with its rock feeling. It has a rock filled part, and then a calm meaningful chorus.     Old School Hollywood 10/10 - I love this song now. I was totally wrong about it before. Love the techno style now. Love the lyrics about a baseball game Daron went to. I love the line \\"Jack Giradi's ten feet tall\\" saying that hes on roids. Love the Hollywood rip to, ha. Darons bits are cool too. Its unlike any other song, which gives it good satire.    Lost in Hollywood 10/10 - Great way to end the album. The chorus is funny and true, another Hollywood rip, haha. Its really a song saying whats its Darons time to shine. Its the other way around with Daron lead singing, and Serj backing him up. He does a great job. Its just a song explaining being lost in Hollywood with all the crap there. This closer exceeds.    I revised the review only because I could change some opinions, and have some more thought. A definite purchase and a great addition to the collection. Can't wait for Hypnotize.
B000003C2S|5.0|This was the first Death album to have a professional recording and it featured ultimate session guitarist James Murphy. From the opening track to the end, the listener is treated to a heavy album that has attributes that other releases in the genre didn't have.  The change-ups, highly harmonized solos, and the whirling effects keep things interesting.  <br /> <br />The songs on this album represent a wide array of slow sludgy intros, to mid-paced verses. The first song also has the hilarious line, \\"Born without eyes, hands, and half a brain, be born addicted to cocaine!\\" The lyrics on this album (also look at that really strange cover!) are quite different from any other Death album because they take up social issues. <br /> <br />The guitars are the best part of the album -lots of cool main riffs and solos. The bass is non-existent (its tough to hear at least). The drumming also gets very old after the four song and some songs has Bill Andrews almost staying entirely in the same time signature! A Disappointment over the leprosy drumming... <br /> <br />Unlike later Death albums, this was the one Death album that was hard but still had its awesome progressive side too. Unfortunately the later albums would sacrifice heaviness for progressive showmanship. That makes this album in some ways the best Death album (and one of their most accesible too).  <br />(R.I.P. Chuck) <br /> <br />

0783240236|5.0|The Birds is Hitchcock's masterpiece. It is my official selection for the best Hitchcock movie EVER...It is so much more than just a horror movie  - especillay when you start asking yourself why the birds attack. Could the bird attacks be fueled by female sexual hysteria and competition for the only virile male (Rod Taylor) in the film? Or could it be just mankind's payback for abusing the fowl of the animal kingdom? This film is loaded with haunting images and symbolism which deserves multiple viewings and discussion among serious film buffs. Not only is the film worth 5 stars but there is an impressive flock of  DVD extras. The film itself is a beautiful widescreen presentation with very nice sound; the extras should thrill Hitchophiles with a \\"making of documentary\\", vintage newsreels of the film's theatrical release, a very witty original trailer, deleted scenes, and Tippi Hedren's original screen test. YES!

B0009KA7BS|5.0|first of all, i don't know why people say this movie didn't make sense, i completely understood it. second of all, i don't know why people say they couldn't stay awake, the movie isn't slow at all. the excorscism secne was so different from other films too. i liked this film so much that i went to the cinema twice to watch it. Keanu Reeves was not wrongly cast, his performance IS believable, as is Rachel W's. Lucifer delivers a grea performance also. this is a good film because it's not the typical mainstream, it's dark, different, and intelligent. the effects are beautiful especially on the angels. there is 1 negative thing to say about the effects, there is a scene where Keanu fights with a demon who seems to be in the form of insects, that is the only scene where i thought the effects lacked a realistic quality. i think some people didn't like this film because it was different, which is why i loved it. i advise anyone who like to break away from the mainstream to see it, because it's not a light hearted, happy go lucky movie. there are a few funny parts in this film though, which makes it all the better. <br />  <br />as for sin city, another comic based film, it was terrible, it lacked sunstance and a story, visually beautiful, but everything else was horrible. i only say this becasue in other reviews, constantine has been compared to it. in sin city, it seems all the director wanted to do for 2 and a half hours was to just shoot usually naked or half naked women. this may be why so many males liked it, which is a bit pathetic. there is no plot, it was such a waste of time.  <br />Constantine: great, Sin City: absolutely terrible
B0000025T6|5.0|Being 32 years old currently, the only Bruce I (and anyone else from my generation and younger) had ever heard was on MTV.  So I'll admit to being very prejudice against the man and his music my whole life. I've always been into deep, dark music, and despised anybody with songs like \\"Born in the USA\\" etc.  It's a tragedy that millions of others younger people will never hear the \\"real\\" Bruce and dismissing him as a pop-hero for \\"old\\" people. The only reason I bought this CD was because I'm a big fan of the movies Badlands and The Indian Runner.  Sean Penn wrote The Indian Runner based mostly on one song on this album (Highway Patrol Man).  Every song on this album instantly makes the listener feel like he has lived the life of each song's charactor.  In the 3-4 minutes it takes Bruce to sing his songs, he forces the listener to become the person in the song for those short few minutes.  Each song forces the listener to experience the haunting lives of others, each in it's own unique, very personal way.  Even if you dont personally relate to the exact problems experienced by the charactors in these songs, you will relate to the sorrow/sad times that everyone of us has gone through.  I'll end this with a quote: <br /> <br />\\"If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility.\\" -- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow <br />
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Master and Commander is definately deserving of its Oscar nominations.  The story, excellent special effects, moving score, and stunning acting is what makes this movie great. <br /> <br />    The Story: The HMS SURPRISE, a Brig `O War, has been sent to the region around South America.  Their mission is to destroy the French ship named: The ACHERON, which is, intent on taking the war to those regions.  The story fleshes out as Capt. Jack Abrey must use every trick up his sleeve to win against the bigger, better Acheron.  The story is very good and the writers should be applauded. <br /> <br />    The Special Effects:  The opening scene of the Surprise and Acheron dueling it out is a testament of how great spcial effects can look.  Splinters of wood fly everywhere, and the cannons look realistic.  The scenes of the Surprize sailing are very amazing.  The ship is very detailed and looks like a real ship was used. <br /> <br />    The Score:  The violen music by Yo Yo MA is definately something that added to this movie.  He plays the violen better than anyone I have ever heard.  The music that is done by the orchestra is similarily excellent.  Music ranges from fast-paced battle music, to sad, quiet music.  I highly suggest buying the score along with the movie. <br /> <br />    The Acting:  As always, Russell Crowe, (Jack Aubrey) delivers a stunning performance as a Captain of an English Warship. Paul Bettany, (Stephen Maturin)likewise performs his roll very well as a doctor.  The other actors in this movie do a great job at their parts.   <br /> <br />    Verdict:  Buy this movie along with the soundtrack.  It is not the least bit boring and should be added to your DVD collection.
B00005QEO1|5.0|Pump was a great album from the moment I heard it!  Aerosmith is more rock driven on here than the Desmond Child/Diane Warren like sound of the last album. I like Monkey and some of the other songs just as much as the hits of Love in An Elevator, which I thought would be a hit the first time I heard it!  There are shades of their '70s period sprinkled within many of the songs and the blues rock stomp that they're known for.  This album strongly shows the band at their most creative and the Steven Tyler/Joe Perry songwriting and music making is phenomenal. Tom Hamilton and Brad Whitfield's guitar playing are at their strongest. And Joey Kramer's plays unlike anything I've heard on the drums, as he hits them hard on the snares. I've turned the volume up on the parts where he hits the drums some 8 to 9 times on this album!  It's Aerosmith's most consistent and rocking album in their post sobriety period. None of the albums they've made in the 90s and after 2001 (though they're just as good) come even close to this '89 effort!
B000000JO3|5.0|the great thing about minor threat is that they are more melodic than other hardcore, while still screaming, swearing, and blasting your ears out. Complete dicography is interesting because you can see the band evolve. By the end it is much more melodic, and the begining is insane hardcore. the philosophy is also very interesting, and ian's lyrics are increadible for a 19 year old kid. I dont agree with all of it, but after getting this album i went mildly straight edge. This is the most important hardcore album besides damaged(this might be better).
B00005JLEU|5.0|THIS MOVIE BROUGHT IN $234 MILLION AND WON THE GOLDEN BEAR PRIZE IN BERLIN GERMENY. IT GOT AN OSCAR NOMINATION. I LOVE THAT THE PEOPLE LOOK MORE LIKE ASIANS INSTEAD OF WHITE PEOPLE. THIS GIVE PIXTAR A RUN FOR IT'S MONEY SPIRITED AWAY DOESN'T NEED TO GO 3D IT'S GREAT 2D ANIMATION BEATS SHREK AND FINDING NEMO. I WISH IN THE U.S. THIS MOVIE GOT MORE COMERCIAL ADVERTISED THAT IT WAS COMING TO THEATHERS SO MORE PEOPLE WOULD KNOW ABOUT IT.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|This is one of Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds albums ever. I really can't say much other than that because I'm stoned. <br />Go buy this album and get high. <br />Cheers.
B0006FO8RA|1.0|Last time I wrote this review it got removed from the website so now, I have to waste my time retyping it again. So what can I say, this girl can't sing and she never could, although I have to admit she did sing a lot better when she first came out. One of the worst songs on the CD, no on the planet, is the single \\"Do Somethin'\\", I mean the beat is horrible, the singing is crap and the music video has got to be her worst to date. \\"My Prerogative\\" is also horrible but then again, I'm not surprised at now it turned out. Bobby Brown's version is 100 000 times better and anyone who has a brain would agree with me. The cover version is just a disgrace to him, I bet he felt like throwing the radio at Whitney Houston's head when he heard it cuz it's just that bad. Nowadays, you don't need to have singing capabilities to get a recording contract, I mean Britney Spears got one and so did Avril Lavigne, Ashanti and Ashlee Simpson, and none of them can sing. I just hope the recording industry smartens up and start signing people not for their looks, but for their talent. So, if you are looking for a real greatest hits collection, then I recommend Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Cher or Tina Turner but whatever you do, avoid this album. <br />
B000006V1Y|5.0|Mariah's metamorphosis album, Butterfly, was the start of phase two of Mariah's music career. Mariah was divorcing Tommy Mottola, she changed her look, and this album was the first of future albums to feature hip-hop collaborations. But one thing that definitely has not changed: THE VOICE!!! Mariah's beautiful, powerful, soaringly 7 octave voice is as prominent as ever!! And I love phase two of Mariah as much as phase one because even with the more hip-hop and R&B sound, Mariah's voice truly shines so I love it all!!<br /><br />The first single, Honey, was Mariah's 3rd #1 single to debut on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 1! At this point, 3 of Mariah's singles debuted at #1 with Fantasy and One Sweet Day. I love Honey, it's a really cool upbeat song. I actually like the Bad Boy Remix best because it just sounds cooler. Butterfly is my all time favorite ballad from this album and Mariah's voice is amazing! I love the lyrics \\"Spread Your Wings And Prepare To Fly, For You Have Become A Butterfly.\\"<br /><br />My All became another #1 on Billboard. This ballad is my 2nd favorite ballad on this album. It's such a wonderful, romantic ballad with Spanish guitar. I love it!! The Roof is a really cool R&B song and I really like the music itself as well, it's really unique. The song Fourth Of July is said to be the sister song to Underneath The Stars and I can see why since they do sound alike in some ways but I can notice a difference. It's a wonderful slow ballad with the sound of birds and Mariah's high notes. Breakdown is a mix of R&B and Hip-Hop featuring Krayzie Bone and Wish Bone from Bone Thugs & Harmony and more birds if you really listen. It's a cool song, not one of my all time favorites but I still like it a lot. Babydoll is a cool R&B song that I really like. I love the music that goes along with it.<br /><br />Close My Eyes is a really cool mid-tempo song with this melody with the piano that I also love! The song Whenever You Call is another favorite and and I love the lyric \\"And You, Have Opened My Heart, And Lifted Me Inside, By Showing Me Yourself Undisguised.\\" There is another version with Brian McKnight but I love the version with just Mariah more!! Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise) is a cool short version of the whole Fly Away Club Mix and I love it. You can get up and dance for a few minutes!! The remake that Mariah chose for this album is The Beautiful Ones which is originally by Prince. Mariah sings this ballad with Dru Hill and it's an amazing cover. I totally love the way Mariah sings in this song, I totally love it!! Outside is the album closer and it's cool how the tempo changes from slow in the beginning to mid-tempo in the middle. It's a great album closer and a very personal message about how Mariah feels like she's on the outside. This import version of Butterfly has two bonus tracks which I really love! The first is Honey (So So Def Radio Mix) featuring Da Brat & JD. I love this remix and it's cool how Mariah actually put some different lyrics for this remix. The other bonus track is Honey (Def Club Mix) which, at first, you think it's just a shorter version of the Classic Mix but there are a lot of differences and I totally love how at the end, the uniqueness of the actual music, it's awesome!!! I totally love it!!!<br /><br />Butterfly may be more R&B and Hip-Hop flavored but any TRUE Mariah Carey fan will accept and embrace it like all her other albums. I have, I love it, as I am a TRUE Mariah fan who has always stood by her and her music and always will until the end of time!!d and I love the lyric \\"And You, Have Opened My Heart, And Lifted Me Inside, By Showing Me Yourself Undisguised.\\" There is another version with Brian McKnight but I love the version with just Mariah more!!

B0000WN0ZK|1.0|It's refreshing to find a film that you hate -it cleanses the palate - and I hate this film. Normally I would never write a negative review, but considering the amount of verbiage this 'classic' has inspired, I fel an almost civic duty to try and re-dress the balance. If it was still showing at a local theatre I would be compelled to go along and form a human barricade to stop unwitting would-be viewers. That's how strongly I feel about this tawdry, empty piece of pseudo-art. The plot is thin, the acting (with the exception of the luminous Vanessa Redgrave) barely rises above the level of a 60's UK soap opera, and possibly worst of all the script is so vacuous that the overwhelming feeling is one of crunching boredom. Ironic considering the setting, one of the more 'happening' of recent history. The main character, played by David Hemmings, is the only fully-realised part in the film, a shame considering his is one of the most repellent roles since cinema began -vain, self-regarding, misogynistic, shallow, greedy and omnipotently self-unaware. He's not the kind of character you love to hate, a la Ian McShane in Deadwood or Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast, he's just a black hole of a person, and it's Antonioni's decision to make him the focal point of the film that grates the most when enduring this nonsense-kind of like staring intently at one of those Magic Eye posters for 2 hours, only for the artist to tell you that it's just a bunch of dots after all. It's just that enervating. Hemmings was much better in a similarly-themed film by another Italian director, Argento's Profundo Rosso. It's not the length of this film that bothers me, nor even the silences -so lengthy they conjure Tarkovsky directing Brando doing Pinter (in a sound-proofed room!), it's the insulting heartlessness at its centre, personified by Hemmings's wide-boy photographer. In fact I would happily sit through the world's longest silent movie -weeks long and with no audio track -as long as it consistedsolely of this character being lovingly and inventively tortured. Just as Roger Ebert said that his colonoscopy footage was more enjoyable than The Brown Bunny, that epic piece of snuff would beat the hell out of Blow-up. About the audio: it's not enough that Antonioni should dispense with any kind of sound for long tracts of this guff, he has also chosen to ignore one of the best soundtracks of the '60s, by 'Herbert' Hancock. Some brief footage of the Yardbirds is not enough to make up for this. Also worth pointing out is that this film contains the least sexy threesome ever commited to the screen. Quite a feat! Unless this is all some sort of early post-modern prank on the hapless viewer, I think it's safe to say that Blow-up is entirely without any kind of merit. In short, I cannot dis this film enough.
B0009P42S2|5.0|Thank GOD that this anime movie from Dreamworks will have a english dialouge unlike (Ghost in the Shell 2). From the director of (Akira) brings you this out standing 2D animated movie that takes place in England I think in the 18 hundreads.
0375758992|5.0|I thought this was an awesome book.  It was so unbelievably interesting!! <br />Whether interested in Africa or not, it is amazing how this family lives, how they \\"rough it\\" not because they had to, but because they wanted to.  They live in homes that only have electricity part of the day and never mind indoor plumbing.  The mother is a very likeable character who, it seems, is an alcoholic by default - she lives through the death of two toddlers.  You read about how the mother uses a rifle to shoot a snake in the kitchen and how the narrator and her mother go on a long, hot journey by horseback to round up some wild cattle.   <br /> <br />I know my review is not doing the book justice, but look how many others like it!
B00005JN0T|3.0|If you like sci fi/action movies, this isn't a bad one. If you want depth to your story, try Bladerunner instead. As the credits say, this was only \\"suggested\\" by Isaac Asimov's book. Except the title and the robot laws, it has nothing to do with the collection of stories. Will Smith does his usual \\"action Will\\" job here. Funny at times, heroic at others, 'I'm right and everyone else is wrong' most of the time. The effects and overall look of the movie are well done with one caveat: two of the action scenes are so dependent on effects, and don't blend well with the humans in the scene, that you don't believe for one second that it's actually happening. Overall a good sci fi/action flick if you don't think too hard about the story.
B000068TPN|5.0|I've read the other reviews saying, \\"This movie is boring\\", \\"Too sentimental\\", \\"Not real\\" blah, blah, blah... This movie is true. I reenact Vietnam and have talked to many vets, among them 1st Cav vets (I have met Joe Galloway- the reporter in the movie also) and this movie (along with Hamburger Hill) is always said to be realistic and true. Its unlike Platoon and Full Metal Jacket (thankfully) in that its not all Hollywood bull, but rather portrays the troopers as they really were, and shows the battle how it really was. The lack of self expression is not there because in the real battle it wasn't there (and movies like Platoon and Full Metal Jacket over do it anyway), and yes, Hal Moore really was that good, whether people like it or not.  <br /> <br />I've read the actual book and the movie fits the main story of the battle in nicely, its not all exactly how it was (the third day is a lot of Hollywood for example), but the movie does an amazing job of portraying the battle overall. The absolute confusion and terror of the fight comes out of the screen and draws you in, leaving you gripping your seat. <br /> <br />If you want a great 'Nam flick get this and \\"Hamburger Hill\\" and you'll be good to go. And please avoid Full Metal Jacket and Platoon, because as a historian of the time I have come VERY close to throwing something at the TV because of the pure stupidity of those two movies.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Carole King is one of the great singer/songwriters of the rock era.  She's one of the great songwriters, period.  Prior to this album's release, she had written songs covered by the Shirelles, Aretha Franklin, Bobby Vee, The Monkees, and The Beatles.  When I first heard this album, it was like listening to a greatest hits collection: one fine song after another.  Furthermore, the song lineup is timeless: \\"I Feel The Earth,\\" \\"So Far Away,\\" \\"It's Too Late,\\" and \\"You've Got A Friend.\\"  All of these songs have been covered by other performers, and have the hit potential today that they did back in 1971.  That type of song is nonexistant in today's era.  While Springsteen and Bono and Coldplay fill up the critics' heads, and the covers of the magazines, King's catalog of songs has eased itself into the public consciousness.
B00080ZG10|2.0|Leonardo Dicaprio tries to be serious but I found the movie to be boring and his acting skills aren't that impressive. I love classic movies and epic movies but this one is just terrible in my opinion.  I just think someone else could have done a better job directing the movie as well as acting in it. Leonardo Dicaprio is handsome and I liked him in Titanic, but he isn't great here. This movie isn't for everyone and its three hours long. It was too long in my opinion.
B00097A5I6|5.0|First of all, I should say I'm a huge fan of Oasis and know probably all of their songs, so I bought the CD the day after it was released, and I tell you, it's worth every single penny I paid for it. <br /> <br />I was surprised the first time I listened to the CD, as every single song on the album is excellent, as opposed to their last releases (SOTSOG had quite a few bad songs in it, and HC had \\"Better Man\\" as its weak link). All members look really good in this album, and it's great to see the end of the era when Noel was the only songwriter in the band. Not that I have anything against his songs (I absolutely adore his songs), but it's just great to see a band like Oasis (that's probably one of the best of the century, if not the best) undergoing such profound changes (for the better of course) in its style. The sound and vibration present in the new album is something unseen in any Oasis previous album, even WTSMG or DM. Don't Believe the Truth is a much more polished sound than anything you have ever heard from Oasis before. With a mix of old-fashioned riffs and vocals that send you right back to the 60's and lyrics that convey deeper meanings and make you think, Oasis seems to have found the balance between the explosion of their early years and the need for making more mature music. It's also remarkable that every one of the songs in the album is very easy to be played in a guitar. I mean, a beginner could play all these songs without much practice, there are no difficult solos or complicated intros. Nothing. And yet, it is flawless. I couldn't possibly name one thing that's not good in the whole CD. <br /> <br />All in all, DBTT is a glorious comeback for a glorious band who can't even be compared to The Beatles anymore; Oasis is far far beyond the music they once tried so hard to sound like. I said it once, and I stick to it: Oasis has become better than The Beatles. <br /> <br />Hey, why are you still reading this review?? Get off your buttocks and go buythis CD, NOW! \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" is a must for any rock fan, believe me. You'll never even get close to regret buying this album.
0802130208|5.0|The novel's title is taken from a quote from Jonathan Swift who wrote that \\"when a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.\\" The novel's protagonist Ignatius J. Reilly, a thirty-something \\"genius\\" who lives with his mother and finds work of all kinds repulvise, has a passion for philosophy, bombast, and jelly donuts. His quest is to save mankind from its vulgarity by sharing his wisdom with the masses. Unfortunately, the French Quarter and the world at large is not prepared to appreciate this rotund neurotic's widsom, which he flails at people with great supercilious venom. The plotlines are too many to account here. Told from the point of view of Ignatius and other comic characters, the novel is not so much plot-driven as it is a slice of life capturing the folly of the human race.<br /><br />Ignatius is a comic hero worthy of Don Quixote; only he isn't killing imaginary dragons; he is on a quest to kill popular culture's meretricious debauchery. For example, he is hostile toward Doris Day and all forms of sentimentality.<br /><br />Many subsequent novels have tried to imitate the humor in the Confederacy but most have failed. For a worthy modern comic masterpiece, check out The Lecturer's Tale by James Hynes.

B000007R1M|5.0|Kraftwerk's 1978 album, \\"The Man Machine\\" is art.  The German electronic quartet of Ralf Hutter, Wolfgang Flur, Karl Bartos, and Florian Schneider have impressed me with this six-song piece of pleasure.  It's material like theirs that get me to buy more of their music.  All six tracks are sweet.  Track one is \\"The Robots.\\"  This song includes a singing robot.  Just for having robotic vocals (which I can't get enough of) this automatically becomes an enjoyable tune of mine.  I also like the electric percussion in the song.  \\"Spacelab\\" is track two on the album.  It's very mysterious sounding.  I feel as if I'm in a space station, all alone, lightyears from everything else in the galaxy.  Next, there's track three, \\"Metropolis.\\"  It starts out slow with percussion that sounds like drops of water and long notes.  The bass comes in and the percussion changes after that.  The vocalists sing out \\"Meeeeetroooooopoliiiiiis\\" in the song.  \\"The Model, track four, is my favorite song on the CD.  It's also the shortest of all the six tunes found on this disc at 3:42.  The song's about a supermodel woman whose beauty and charm led her to fame and popularity.  Track five, \\"Neon Lights\\" is nine minutes long.  It's the longest track in the album.  The lyrics for the song are \\"Neon lights, shimmering neon lights, and at the fall of night, the city's made of light.\\"  They're only heard in the first half of the song.  The second half contains psychadelic sounding synthesizers.  The final track is \\"The Man Machine.\\"  This track includes singing robots, different from \\"The Robots.\\"  This is a very nice tune, a good song to finish off the album.  All six tracks are great.  This CD has \\"genius\\" written all over.  I could listen to it the whole way through whenever I'm in the mood, and I get into that mood quite often.  I'm glad there's a music group like this.
B0002O7XVI|5.0|Few years after the painful personal tragedy of this gifted director, he decided to materialize this sad love story with a wonderful photography, an unforgettable soundtrack, an astonishing cast and a slow paced but perfectly articulated script.<br />As all we know the everlasting prejudices and moral conventions do not belong to a specific country, religious beliefs, or citizenship. These rules remain in the unconscious collective, if you just want an supported evidence, go for Effie Briest in Germany and Madame Bovary in France.<br />These portraits are not more than the final result of a consequence of the inability to get the true culmination inside the individual sphere of the triumph of love between the couple, this failure has its more important testimony in the King Artur's legend and this seems a remarkable point because this is simply the most important myth of the Western World.<br />This film meant to the endless beauty Natasha Kinski to be known.<br />Admirable and highly recommended artwork.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Just when I thought Trey and Matt had lost all comedic sensibility, they come out with Team America the funniest f---ing film of 2004. Lets face it people. South Park is lame! And it has been for the past 2 seasons. But I digress...<br /><br />Team America is non-stop raunchy fun. Not only is this movie funny but it's a little true to nature. I can admit it... we're all a bunch of big, fat, arrogant American bastards that love to blow s--t up! F--k yeah! This movie is like looking into a fun house mirror... it's a distorted image BUT IT'S SADLY STILL YOUR REFLECTION! Trey and Matt go all out to make this movie the creme of kitsch and it works! The funniest scene is the puppet sex scene. GET THE UNCENSORED VERSION! IT'S ALOT FUNNIER!<br /><br />Team America is about the \\"World Police\\" and their relentless pursuit of WMD's. Along the way they hire an actor to infilterate the terrorists hiding place and find out who is conducting the terrorist acts. Thats when the s--t hits the fan. Stereotypes run rampant in this film and there is tons of hilarious puppet carnage! If you enjoy movies like Meet the Feebles or South Park The Movie, you'll love Team America.
0312995423|3.0|Dan Brown is good at conveying interesting, cool information to the masses and at creating cinematic action sequences.  He also keeps the action moving at a harrowing clip, to give his books that \\"can't put it down\\" feel.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that once you have read a couple of his books, you know who the bad guy is going to be early on and you know that the action will be contrived to climax in an early-identifiable location and will hinge on one of the seemingly irrelevant bits of background information that he hits you over the head with in the early chapters.  Digital Fortress has some interesting sequences and twists, but ultimately strains credulity too many times, from smart people taking interminably long to figure simple things out to too easily creating isolation of his characters in a facility that would likely have people in abundance even on a supposed non-work day.  This is better than the politically non-credible Deception Point, but not up to the intrigue levels of Angels & Demons or Davinci Code.  Donald J. Bingle, Author of Forced Conversion
B000002NFM|5.0|This has to be one the best albums I have ever listened to, the thing that makes this album stand out from most other dance albums, is that The Prodigy have drawn back on a variety of influences including Hip-Hop, Rock and Punk. Listening to this album just makes you want to get up and move, there is not one weak song on this album, each song has its own unique essence whilst still maintaining the aggressive, upbeat, energy which the album is all about. My personal favorites are Smack my Bitch up, the vocal solo just leads you into a trance, Breathe this is a typical Prodigy song, with heavy beats, aggressive chords and vocals from Keith Flint and Fuel My Fire, which is very different and has a great punk edge to it, I just love the opening drums to this song. I can't speak highly enough of this album, if your looking for an album full of energy and excitement, then I highly recommend this album, even if your a rock fan.
1573223085|1.0|Ugh! Amazing how these people can even begin to believe this stuff. I can practically see the waving of ruffled hands. I don't know where to begin. The premise that we can do the \\"higher\\" kinds of work and let the smokestaff stuff go abroad was articulated by our Sec of Labor Robert Reich in his ca. 1990 book. That was before India emerged as the foremost intellectual property powerhouse. It is #1 in software. You knew that, didn't you? (source Tom Peters, Pat Choate, many others)  Notes added 4 years later: I think I was being too dismissive of his premise, although I think there is some validity in my points. My original point was that he is in a hurry to abandon \\"smokestack\\" industrial thinking in favor of a \\"higher\\" right-brain consciouness. THe best thinkers of the ages counsel a more measured approach.  What they say is that you should be like the two wheels of the cart: one wheel is your skills, experience, education, while the other wheel is your consciousness, inner attainment, empathy. Both are needed.   A breathless new-age movement should pay attention to basics as well. Sure, be touchy-feely, but do you know how to write, how to use a computer well, have marketable skills? Be practical AND a good human being! THe leisure time from your practical skills can be used to develop yourself.  Just some thoughts from a 65-yo man. Life is brief, like a flash of lightning. Use it well.  I would like to suggest what is at the root of our problem. I dont want to be didactic, but listen up. corrupt politicians voted in on ideological, \\"conceptual\\" platforms like Republicam vs. Democrat. A majority take payments from foreign interests and go to work for them afterwords. The outsourcing of jobs, the H1B insourced workers constitutes a danger to the US: the loss of jobs is bad enough, but the loss of the technology base is fatal. Right now, 90% of the Vitamin C is made in China. Why?

B00005JN2Z|4.0|I just read a long review on Amazon by a reviewer who said some pretty intelligent things about Michael Mann's direction.It made for an interestin read really.Sadly,I havent followed his films but he does manage to raise an important point. The Audioslave track does indeed not match the pace of the film and the time it was played.There was substantial few precious seconds devouted to it though.<br /><br />To deny this film from what it deserves would be criminal.I can safely say Tom Cruise proves himself time and again as one of the best actors time has seen.He will be remembered by someone in the 22nd century as a man of great devoution to what he was good at.Jamie Foxx's character on the other hand was what be a mixture of morality and individuality.There wasnt much of a proportion between the two but he turned into a righteous individualist in the film when it mattered.<br /><br />I must add it's not easy to make such precise paced flicks.There's nothing predictable to me.I quite liked the discussion of reality checks between Foxx and Cruise which made one of them go crazy.Also the discussion of Miles Davis in a jazz bar was more interesting than what I can possibly try and comprehend.<br /><br />All in all,this film would go down in my memory lane as one of the best directed action/thriller films I have seen in a long time.It's not easy to make a film about just one night and spread out in a chain of events leading to one another and making it all look terrificly well done.<br /><br />What I disliked about the film was its limited outlook.No,dont get me wrong because even if I try I couldnt find a flaw in the film that would make me stomp my foot hard.It's just that it perfectly fits the four star grade.<br /><br />And oh yes,Tom Cruise's suit fits him like silver skin.He's a bit of a Terminator 2 villain in this film and I'm sure a lot of people would love to watch this side of the man.<br /><br />Jesus,he even buys flowers...
B00022TPSO|5.0|When Black Sabbath unleashed this monster of a debut they also unleased the monster we all love and know as Heavy Metal! Never before were the guitars this heavy/low tuned and distorted, never before did the bass sound so sludgy. Go ahead try and name a heavy metal band that wasnt influenced by Black Sabbath, thats right you cant!<br /><br />The album opens up with one of Black Sabbaths best known songs, 'Black Sabbath' this is the darkest, heaviest, and scariest song you have ever heard in your life. \\"Whats that, oh please God help me!\\" now that is a lyric! The guitar riff at the end of the song is one of the all time greatest. Next is 'Wizard' which has the harmonica if you can bealive it. Its almost bluesy the bass line is killer and the drumming is over the top. Some of Tony Iommi's best guitar playing can be heard on this song. Listen to this track and try and tell me he is not one of the best players ever! 'WASP' is just kind of a intro into 'Behind The Wall Of Sleep' which has an awesome guitar riff and Ozzy's voice sounds almost perfect on this track and the anti-war lyrics are great as well. 'BASSicaly' is vassicaly just a long bass solo by Geezer and its probley the best thing he ever player. I take that back the best thing he ever played was the bass line to 'N.I.B.' after the bass line the drums kick and and Tony enters with another amazing guitar riff as only he could create. 'Whicked World' is my favorite song on the album because it has Bill Wards all time greatest drumming, and Tony Iommi play some of the most amazing guitar of his 30+ year carear. Ozzy almost sounds like Ian Anderson on this one. Next is the Medly 'Bit of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning' Bit of Finger gets its name from the accedent that cut off the tips of Iommis fingers just before the album was recorded. Once again amazing Guitar solos powerful lyrics and Vocals and a rythem section that was never topped.<br /><br />Even though 'Wicked World' is a bonus track on this I like this imported version of the album better because the song layout lets you skip around if you want to even though you wount want to because every song is a classic.<br /><br />Black Sabbath is Black Sabbaths all time best album, yes even better then Paraoid. Do yourself a favor and get this legendary album!this imported version of the album better because the song layout lets you skip around if you want to even though you wount want to because every song is a classic. <br /> <br />Black Sabbath is Black Sabbaths all time best album, yes even better then Paraoid. Do yourself a favor and get this legendary album!
B000000WA4|5.0|ok.....people keep saying this cd sux and there are people that say this cd rocks...  but the thing is    people dont know what they are talkin about     yes this cd is really awesome and it is worth having    but the people that say it really sucks and it needs to be destroyed have never really heard good music    cuz this cd is what changed alternative music forever...... <br /> <br />think about it  if people didnt like the smashing pumpkins MCIS cd   dont you think they would stop making cd's    because   stop and think about    all of the new bands......they suck  they have one cd and they are done     Smashing Pumpkins were the longest lasting alternative band of the 1990's *fact*   and no one understands  they wouldnt be like that if people didnt like them......... <br /> <br />people say billy corgan doesnt know what he is talking about in his music     he opened up his heart to the world to know how he really felt and he even took the risk of adding in synths and strings and even a whole orchestra <br /> <br />Billy, Darcy, Jimmy, and James    were part of the best band in the history of the 1990's   people say Nirvana was the best   Nirvana was actually overrated  very overrated   the Smashing Pumpkins    didnt like all the publicity stuff  they wanted to be real people that made their own kind of music...... <br /> <br />they are not grunge they are alternative which is actually a psychodelic pop feel    where they sound like they are celestial beings and it is coming from outer space and its mystical      they are really great    i hope people give the Smashing Pumpkins a try before they judge <br /> <br />because it sickens me to know that people dont even know them  hate them.........it sucks to know there are people out there like that           this album deserves 5 stars not just for the music   but for the effort and compassion the band put into this record   and how it turned out over all <br /> <br /> <br />-KASEY <br />
B0000C1733|4.0|I recommend this disc to all who're new to Red Hot Chilli Peppers.The others who've been fans need no advice because they know this is a good collection.<br /><br />It starts with a song that has somehow become the universal chant for RHCP. \\"Under The Bridge\\" is something that sets up the disc for a bass adrenaline filled ride.Under The Bridge is one song noone at a RHCP song wants to miss being performed.<br /><br />\\"Give It Away\\" has some catchy melody though not a favourite of mine it always feels good to hear to the song at a gym or on the radio (rare).\\"Californication\\" is just about as perfect an intro to RHCP as can be.\\"Scar Tissue\\" is an okay track but its followed by RHCP's signature ability to surprise song.<br /><br />\\"Otherside\\" has the druggie feel to it that can offset one's mood no matter what.I'm not a fan of \\"By the way\\" but it's a good song to listen to when you're speeding your car.Other tracks I love on the disc are \\"Universally Skipping\\", \\"my friends\\" and \\"road trippin\\"<br /><br />Road Trippin is a personal favourite song of mine.I'm waiting to have someone to sing the song to because it's the ideal song to sing to the one you admire or want to be admired by.Enough said.<br /><br />Why I don't give this album 5 stars is because even though RHCP are a great better than average band they haven't really punched the air with a perfect album. I await that perfect that album in which they win the world over again. \\"By The Way\\" was good,Californication was better for the time it came out. I'm not  a fan of BSSM.<br /><br />Anyhow,to each their own. Hope my review helps some amateur listeners.<br /><br />Some other great songs by this band are - Tear,Pea,Tearjerker,Aeroplane and Transcending.<br /><br />I like Aeroplane because it's almost double as crazy and energetic as some of System Of A Down songs but then only I know it.
6304698526|4.0|The car chase in this movie is the reason I can watch it and still be excited!  To see the drivers going through the gears and hear those powerful engines do their stuff, it's a thing of beauty!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Have been fortunate enough to see The Eagles many times including Farwell I in Atlanta recently.  Needless to say, they are my all-time favorite band!  Their enduring appeal is obvious when you see every age group represented at any show they do.  It is wonderful when your teenage children INSIST on going to any Eagles concert with Mom and Dad.   <br /> <br />My son watched the show on NBC in high def with the surround sound cranked up.  His only comment was \\"awesome.\\"  We will be watching this DVD for years to come. <br /> <br />If you are a baby boomer and haven't seen these guys in a long time, do yourself and your children a big favor and get this DVD.  Maybe they are getting a little slow, but they are still the absolute best!  Rock on, guys!  I hope we see Farewell tours for many years to come!
079073804X|4.0|This is certainly a great made Horror movie, but honestly - It's not THAT scary. It has it's creepy moments but nothing too frightening, really so I don't understand what all the fuss is about. Still, a good, worth watching movie, I love the first scenes and the music at the beginning.
B000005DQR|4.0|It's a nice balance between hip-hop rythms and chill-out melodies. It's funny and introspective at the same time. You can pass from nice and strong rythms like in \\"The Number Song\\" through chilling and deep melodies like in \\"Changeling\\" until you get to dark, groovy and cinematic songs like \\"How Does Your Soul Look Like\\". In my opinion, this album is DJ Shadow's best, this is the one album who asecured him a place between the greatest ambience, chill and trip hop compositors.
B00005RHGK|3.0|...that's for sure! If not the best nor my favorite horror-movie I find it amongst the better ones (it is original as a big plus) -this being said; hm, let's be honest here, most horror-movies (I repeat; Most!) contain some lack of intelligence and fantasy to make the \\"utilmate complete story\\", and scores instead on style and special-effects, it seldom depends too much on the acting, what matters are the fit locations and the sound-effects play a big part too.     There are exeptions of course; We have masterpieces like the classic \\"The Excorsist\\" and \\"The Omen\\" (and many more), and also the more recent \\"The Sixth Sence\\" and \\"The Others\\". Fantastic!    \\"The Ring\\" and \\"The Grudge\\" are perhaps even creepier than them all, but let's face it; Not much story behind the effective camera-work and sound-effects that make the viewers sit tightened to their seats biting their fingernails off. Some stories have more to tell than others.    The best part of \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" is the car, that alone looks scary (\\"Who drives something looking as mean as that!\\"). Bravo!    I thought the first half like many others is the best part, but the second part is anything but boring. Predictable perhaps, not livivng up to its' premise, but indeed entertaining.    I have no problem recommending this movie, very good!
0790731002|1.0|Val Kilmer is a good Batman, but he is not Bruce Wayne. You have to believe he is both (like Michael Keaton) to enjoy this very bad movie. Good story and introduction on ROBIN, but the rest of the movie gets boring. This is unwatchable at times due to corny villains. This movie is only for hardcore BATMAN fans. Stick to BATMAN & BATMAN RETURNS for your DVD Collection.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles are the greatest band ever hands down. Their performances are so perfect and they are true perfectionists. I Have seen The Eagles four times, Dallas in 2003, Boston twice in 2004, and Providence in 2005. They are easily the best concert I have seen and I am only 16 years old. Their music is so pure and great I am sure this DVD will be better then their concerts.
B00080ZG1A|1.0|just about the most boring film i have ever seen thank god i did not waste my money at a theatre.  the only redeeming highlights are the hilarity of kate blanchetts hooty tooty fake new england accent vs. leos sorry attempt at texan. tried to hang in there, turned it off after one hour.
B00097DX3U|3.0|but then very few groups have nearly as good of reviews on their second as their first album.  It took many listens for the first album to grow on me.  Maybe the same will happen with this one.  If you liked the first it's worth putting in your collection.   <br /> <br />The Rage Against the Machine sound comes through on this album.  Great rhythm section.  The lead guitar on some songs just doesn't do it for me.  Others it blazes.  I would like to see another guitarist added to the group.     <br /> <br />Chris' vocals aren't as strong and powerful.  The best screamer in Rock seems to have lost a little of his growl on this recording.  Hopefully it's just temporary.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Star Wars first came out when I was four and I loved it, there was nothing like these movies!  I bought these DVD's since I didn't have any of the movies on VHS or DVD and rec'd them the other day.  I have watched Return of the Jedi, Empire Strikes back, and the extra DVD with all the bonus footage.  I've yet to watch \\"A New Hope\\" since I've seen it so many times so cannot comment on it yet.  First, I feel the bonus DVD was worth the price of admission.  I love to see how things were made and all the artistic background stuff since my B.A. is in retail advertising.  I can see what other people are saying when they speak of the little details that were changed in these DVD's.  Things like skys being much bluer and brighter, or machines and creatures being more detailed, and I was ok with that.  However, when I watched the Return of the Jedi and saw how it had been changed from the original version, to say I was ticked would be the understatement of the year!  How could Lucas take out the original man who played Darth in the last scene, and replace his image with that of Hayden's?  It was like blasphemy to me!  It was totally stupid of him and totally didn't work and messed up the final scenes.  Also, he added some New Years type celebration scenes in the end that seemed totally out of place and really corny.  I just don't understand why Lucas would ruin his perfectly good art like that and with additions that made no sense.  Come on now, we see old Yoda and Ben in the end as they were when they died, so why now are we seeing a young Anakin instead of the older, good version after he died like in the original?  Like I said, the bonus DVD is worth the cost in my opinion, but be warned that the Return of the Jedi ending is not true, not it's original self.  Actually now, I'm afraid to watch \\"A New Hope\\" and see what kind of damage Lucas did to it.  If something's not broke you don't try and fix it!
068483605X|5.0|This book was wonderful. It is a story of working together to achieve a common goal. It shows that you can learn from your adversaries. Also, it shows how human beings can disrespect nature. This book made me care about the rabbits and what happened to them.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My 9 year old received this for Christmas and we haven't stopped playing it since.  We don't even put it away with the rest of our games, it's kept in the kitchen at all times so we can sneak a quick game or two before or after dinner.  We've also had family tournaments that have become quite competitive.  I only wish they made Blokus on a larger board for more players.  It is theraputic after a long day to just relax and play a round or two.  If your family is into game nights, this will surely be a hit for kids and adults alike. We are totally hooked!
B00004ZDVQ|4.0|Orignial Musiquarium I is one of the better compilations of Stevie Wonder's 70s music.  It is a no-nonsense, just the hits compilation with 4 \\"then new\\" tracks.<br /><br />What bothers me is the remastering of this.  I agree with another reviewer stating that the sound is somewhat bad on this. Listening to Superstition is like listening to an old cassette that veers in and out of muffled to a high trebly sound.<br /><br />Too bad because the music is A1 prime!<br /><br />A++ on the music<br /><br />C- for the sound.
B0007TKNI8|5.0|Long time ago, I read Phantom of the Opera and thought a long time about what a beautiful story it was. Sad, but beautiful. And then, last December, I heard that in the orchastra I play in we were gonna play Music of the Night. After listening to the track on the soundtrack, I thought...I have to see this movie. And so I did. <br /> <br />I am impressed by the plot, the costumes, and acting, and most importantly, the singing. I loved all the characters (even the annoying Spanish lady who reminds me of my arch nemesis...) and I almost cried at the end when the Phantom is left broken hearted. <br />It spirals down to this: This is a beautiful musical for those who don't mind when the characters just spontaniously burst into song and don't mind costumes, or catchy tunes. This is an amazing movie and I look forward to (when I scrap up the money) buying it. I highly recommend it to anyone.
B000002HH9|3.0|Since \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" is one of the weaker Cure albums, and inferior to the other three post-\\"Disintegration\\" albums, I hadn't listened to it for quite a while.  I'm glad I did, because it's not bad when you give it a second chance.  I think the problem might be that Robert Smith and Co. try to do too much, sometimes using an excessive amount of horns, other times attempting to create a pseudo Calypso or bluesy feel.  Some tracks, such as \\"The 13th\\" and \\"Treasure\\" sound almost like past songs, just not as good.  \\"Round & Round & Round,\\" and perhaps a couple of other selections, gives one a greater appreciation for the \\"skip\\" button on the c.d. player.  Some of the extraneous sounds made by Smith after the song ends are quite annoying, and I really didn't need to hear his \\"strawberry kiss\\" in \\"Mint Cars.\\"    However, WCM starts and ends off strong with the contemplative \\"Want\\" and \\"Bare.\\"  Along the way, \\"Jupiter Crash\\" is quite good (who besides Robert Smith would memorialize in song this celestial event?), as is \\"Numb,\\" which almost sounds as if it were an extra from \\"Disintegration\\" or \\"Wish.\\"  My favorite song on the album is \\"Trap,\\" an atypically straightward rocker with a memorable hook.    Perhap The Cure overstretched here, trying to be all things to all of their fans.  Nevertheless, \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" is certainly worth it, and, if you're like me, deserves another listen.
B00065GWK6|1.0|I will give Napolean Dynamite this: It IS original. Very original. On the other hand, it is also lame. Disturbingly lame. Before I saw this, my friends constantly raved to me, \\"Oh my god, you have to see Napolean Dynamite!\\" \\"Well why?\\" \\"Becuase it's the funniest movie ever, dude!\\" \\"Funniest movie ever?\\" \\"Funnier than Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\\" And I thought, wow, if it's funnier than Monty Python, it is a must see. Oh, how dissappointed I was...    The story begins with an extremely nerdy kid walking onto a school bus, where he then shuffles wierdly to the back of the bus. A kid waits for him. When he sits down, the kid asks, \\"What are you going to do today, Napolean?\\" to which he replies, \\"Whatever I feel like, god!\\" My friends laughed hysterically at it. I, however, did not.    Now, often, when I told my friends that I really didn't like the movie Napolean Dynamite, they were in shock. They'd ask why? Hmm...Well in all honesty, I don't know. It might be because I could be an old, cruel, mean fart who does not enjoy other people having fun. It might be because...Well, just because. But I honestly don't think that those are the cases. I think it's because I just didn't find this deadpan comedy funny. I'm more into the dark, subtle humor that takes time to appreiciate and recognize.    But alas, it seems to be just me that did not like the movie Napolean Dynamite. I give the creators five stars for truly making an original film, but I give them a very kindly one star for making the original film that sucks on the whole.    All in all: Ya like dead pan comedies with scary nerds and no plots? Hey! Here's Napolean Dynamite. Ya like the more sophisticated movies, then definetly move on, 'cuz you won't find a sophisicated funny movie here.
B000002H6C|4.0|This is arguably Metallica's heaviest cd. It's got powerful guitar and drums, good added sounds (like the battle noises at the beginning of \\"One\\"), but the recording is a little different. Still fairly good sound quality though. I love the song Harvester of Sorrow great lyrics and music, heaviest metallica song ever, almost. Definitely a change of pace from their previous cd Master of Puppets, but in a good way. Overall, I liked it a lot but thought some of the songs were lacking the right ingredients...you've got to listen to it to know what i mean. But its still awesome, great way to tribute Cliff. Amen.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|WOW! WHAT A SCARY MOVIE! I positivly love this movie. Scary as hell and gory as the eye could see. Put 2 and 2 together and you get thrills and chills the whole movie long! Okay I have to admit the acting isn't great but it gets the job done. The acting is better than that Konishi- Waa crap in the Grudge. I know horror movies. I own alot! I mean alot! If you want to see saw, buy it! Don't rent! BUY IT! <br />PLOT: Two men are in a over sized bathroom tied up in chains as they try to figure out where the hell they are, and find the past of each other. All of this leads up to a incredible scary ending with a huge twist. <br /> You just have to ask yourself one question. \\" How much blood would you spill to stay alive!?\\"
B000002V0Q|5.0|This cd is amazing. It has great lyrics that fit perfectly with the title. The guitars sound perfect, and there are multiple solos in almost every song. There isn't anything to say against this album or Dave Mustaine. My least favorite song on here would be Foreclosure of a Dream, but I would still rate it seven out of ten stars. The best songs would be Skin O My Teeth, This Was My Life, Captive Honour, and Ashes in Your Mouth. If you're a metal fan you have to have this cd in your collection. It's a must. Enough said BUY IT!!!!!!!
B0000524CY|5.0|Oh my god. This movie is terrifying... no not just terrifying, its electrifyingly terrifying! The time I saw this never before seen version, I was just watching Minority Report, which is akward because that also has Max Von Shadow in it. Well I suddenly relized that I just rented the movie, THE EXORCIST, and haven't watched it yet. So I put it in the DvD player and it began. What a creepy, eerie, mysterious beginning to a movie it was.  <br />  PLOT: It is about an actress, Chris, who is making a major motion picture as her 12 year old daughter, Regan, is going through some wierd stages. But Chris just thinks its nerves when the night Regan's matress of her bed is bouncing up and down violently. It is then when she goes to a psycoligist and he puts Regan on some medication. But then the way Regan acts is becoming more serious and frighting. All this leads to Chris calling 2 priests, Father Merrin and Father Karras, when they decide to perform... an Exorcism. <br />    This movie is incredible. Heart punding and a script that is written by the writter of the book himself. Watch the movie and enjoy! Just don't play with a ouiji board!
B0000CDLA7|1.0|This is easily the worst DT album to date. The songs are so boreing I couldn't listen to the entire thing. I had to come back to it several times before I heard the entire thing. It's a total waste of time if you own any other 2 DT CDs as every riff and rhythm is on every previous CD. Reminds me of the Who song \\"Same Old Song\\" ....... \\"We write the same old Song with a few new lines and no one seems to hear it\\" It's the same scale contest with a bit more metal influence.

0140277447|4.0|This book has 225 pages of text, 4 pages of acknowledgments, 53 pages of notes, a table of contents, 6 pages of index, two small maps, and 24 pages of photographs. <br /> <br />Chang's very credible story is a well researched account of Japanese atrocities during the World War II capture and occupation of Nanking, then the capital of China. Much of the story focuses on a handful of Westerners who established an International Safety Zone within the city.  An unlikely hero, the leader of this effort, was a Nazi who sought aid for the Chinese from Adolph Hitler. <br /> <br />Japanese atrocities in World War II left 19 million Chinese dead. The Nanking massacre alone accounted for 300,000.  Non-combatants were raped, used for bayonet practice and killing contests, burned and buried alive, hung by their tongues, used for biological experiments, and otherwise tortured and killed, often for shear pleasure. Unborn children were even ripped from the stomachs of pregnant women. <br /> <br />Japan was dominated by a sense of racial superiority, which relegated the Chinese to sub-human status.  The Japanese military was built on a harsh disciplinary system and pecking order that granted little value to its own soldiers.  These men found an outlet for their frustration by abusing enemy non-combatants and POWs. Such actions were condoned and even encouraged by the Japanese government and the Emperor himself. Indeed, much of this behavior was integral to Japan's war strategy. One in three POWs died in the hands of the Japanese compared to one in twenty five in the hands of the Germans. <br />  <br />Unlike Germany, Japan has not fully atoned for World War II atrocities.  A formal apology has never been issued, and reparations have yet to be paid.  Japan remains in denial.  One wonders how to trust such a nation today. <br /> <br />Holocaust museums across America should include an account of this horrible episode.  A feature film should have been made long ago.
076790382X|4.0|This is som efunny stuff, written in short essays so you can read on the pot. Good stuff- funny!
B0009A40ES|5.0|Um, a slasher? A thriller? What are people looking for watching this movie? Its a full on dark comedy, with some social commentary. Yes, its violent. But every circumstance of violence is accompanied by a insanely psychotic act and awkward way of going about life that coulnd't have been done better. The music theme is hilarious. Every bit of writing is executed wonderfully. Take or leave it, but well actually i don't care this is just my oppinion.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller's Sin City is film noir for the 21st century. The type of film noir that movie audiences have never seen. It's Mickey Spillane and Raymond Chandler for a new generation. Unlike the writings of Spillane and Chandler, Miller's world features no heroes. Everyone is a villain in Sin City. As we know, however, villains can be good and heroes can be bad. The thin line between the two is at the heart of Sin City. <br /> <br />Brilliantly written by Frank Miller and brilliantly directed by Miller and Robert Rodriguez, Sin City is simply one of the most exciting, invigorating films I've ever had the pleasure to see. Movies like this are exactly why I love movies. Sin City is the cinematic art form at its peak. It's bold, passionate, imaginative, striking and uncompromising; things that 90 percent of movies today are not. <br /> <br />Squeamish audiences will not be amused, however and that is to be expected. Sin City is quite an extreme film that features tons of extreme violence the likes of which is rarely seen in a Hollywood movie. Because of that, it is sure to be the subject of controversy. However if you can stomach the violence, Sin City will be a unforgettable movie going experience. Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez have created a world never before seen in the movies. A world that exists nowhere in reality except on the page and on the movie screen. The film must be separated from reality.    Sin City is at no time and in no way realistic, nor is it supposed to be. It's a world where the writer's imagination is the only limit. Fans of film in general and film noir in particular, fans of comics, and fans of pulp crime stories will find much to love in Sin City. I, for one, already consider this gruesome little film among my all-time favorites.  <br /> <br />I will not talk about the stories or the actors, save that Mickey Rourke delivers an awesome, Oscar-worthy performance. I will only say two more words: see it.
B0006399FS|5.0|This is just one of those CDs that you can listen to over and over and never get bored with it.  \\"Vertigo\\" \\"All because of You\\" and \\"Original of the species\\" are my three favorites.  U2 still has it, and I think that they always will.  They remain the last hope for modern music.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Hi<br /><br />Was Lucky to see The Eagles \\"Twice\\" when they came to Sydney Australia. They had announced they where recording the Melbourne concert for a DVD. They even gave a free concert to record extra angles etc.<br /><br />A great Concert is all I can say! Joe Walsh was kind enough to acknowledge Glenn Shorrock from the little River band (LRB)  who was in the \\"house\\" the night I went, sounds like they partied well in the 70's!<br /><br />Am looking forward to the DVD arriving to me in Sydney!<br /><br />John  Dearing
B00005JKMQ|3.0|Will Smith sure did try hard but you just can not make a movie about Ali.  It's way to hard.  He's had such a busy and great life that you cannot fit everything into a movie.  But it was a great effort.  I preferred the documentary 'When We Were Kings'.<br /><br />I bought this movie though and it is a excellent dvd.  I recommend buying only if you like boxing movies a whole bunch.
0060930349|5.0|Whenever I have told new acquaintances that I have a degree in history, they have typically groaned.  They all hate history, they tell me, because it is just names and dates.  Besides, the text books in school were extraordinarily dull.      Of course, history is not about names and dates, it is about people and ideas.  It tells us how we came to be who we are.  Paul Johnson has written that kind of history in a style that is informative, lively, and entertaining.  The book is eccentric at times and opinionated -- this is the first book I have ever read that portrayed Harding in a positive light.  The book is never dull.    A number of reviewers have criticized this book because it is conservative.  I suppose that if your perspective on life is that anyone whose political perspective differs from your own could not possibly produce a work worth interacting with or enjoying, this will be a problem.  For those sufficiently confident in their beliefs to engage an informative book and decide what they will agree or disagree with, this is a great read.    One reviewer seemed surprised that a conservative criticized Joe McCarthy:  I suggest he should get out more.    I would also recommend a couple of other Johnson books I have read:  \\"Modern Times\\" -- a world history since World War I -- and \\"Intellectuals\\" -- a saucy look at the lives of several intellectual leaders of the 20th century.
B00005JKL8|5.0|Behind Enemy lines had great sourround sound and :It looks good on the widescreen version.  This movie is sort of between war, action, and drama.  This is Owen Wilson's best movie if you ask me.  Gene Hackman was a perfect captain and still can act very well at his age.  The historic parts in here are in the start of the movie in which it shows Yugosliva soldiers a long time ago. In the middle of te movie Owen Wilson is being chased by the soldiers and fallas into mud with all these dead bodies.  The soldiers see the bodies but do not see him.  when they are looking at the dead bodies the director shows a flashback of when the soldiers killed the muslims a long time ago.  Those were historic scenes.  This movie had wonderful camera angles and great directing.  When Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman are talking on the radio with eachother their expressions on their face are great and the special effects on this film just blew me away.  Wow how blessed we are to have all this new technology so we can make great special effects.  I liked the special feautures on this dvd.  My favorite special feauture was the commentary by the director and the editor.  I went to deleted scences and they talked about why they took some of those scenes out.  Wow the director even said this movie was origanally going to be rated R because of the graphic violence in the scenes that they deleted.  On the special feautures you can go behind the scenes of the movie and watch tthe Minority Report trailer.  The airplanes in this movie were really sweet and when Owen and his buddy are fixing to crash into a bunch of trees it is just so cool.  They pause the movie for like three seconds and then keep on going on with the scene and pause it for like three times.  You better buy this movie because if you don't you are making a mistake.  God bless you and have a great day.
1400043662|3.0|I have read all of Mr. Murakami's books and he is by far my favorite author. The Wind-up Bird Chronicle is my all time favorite book, and this is coming from the son of a librarian that grew up in libraries. I was in Japan when this book came out and it was like Christmas for me. I still have no regrets about buying this book and it was worth the price. I just wish I could meet Mr. Murakami and tell him, please stop with the educating bits. Throughout the book there are long passages where he is trying to teach the reader about literature classical music and jazz. These passages have nothing to do with the plot and are really tiring. I'm sitting on my couch reading and I don't want to put the book down, and suddenly I have to read these inserts where the characters suddenly stop being who they are and turn into Mr. Murakami telling us how good a piece of music is, or something about Greek mythology. I want to know about these incredible characters he has created. I don't need or want these insertions that take away from the flow of the book. That said, keep them coming please sir, and thank you for lighting my world during the dark times.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Blade is a character from Marvel comics who is half vampire and (somewhat ironically) hunts down vampires and kills them.  Blade 2 leaves off where the first movie ends.  Blade is hunting his mentor Whistler who has been captured by vampires.  It is best not to ask why Whistler is still alive when is was obvisously killed in the first movie because questions like this will lead you in dead ends.  I think that the movie was trying to imply that Whistler escaped death because he was bitten by a vampire and that Blade later converted him back to a human.  Anyway, it is best not to worry about this gap in the plot. <br /> <br />Anyway, after saving Whistler, Blade is propositioned by a group of vampires to hunt done and destroy other vampires who feed on vampires and can fully open their jaws like a snake.  Throughout the movie, Blade hunts these \\"super vampires\\" while keeping a close eye on the vampires that he is working with because they are in face a group that has been training to kill him for two years.  Lots of action and a handful of suprizes ensure. <br /> <br />I'd say that the Blade series is of good quality in the recent Marvel superhero movies.  Blade 2 is not as good as Spiderman 2 but much better than the abomination that was The Hulk, and better than the draggy X-Men movies.  Wesley Snipes plays Blade as if the role were written for him.  This movie is a straight-laced action film and does not suffer a convoluted plot like the similar vampire movie Underworld did.  Instead it is just what you would anticipate from an action movie.  The only real problem that I had with the movie was that the romance between Blade and Lisa was so tepid that it did not add much to the movie.  I think that a love scene between the two was much needed.  But still, Blade 2 should be readily enjoyable to fans of the superhero genre.
B000001FOL|5.0|Nico is still mostly remembered for her tambourine-shaking days in the Velvet Underground, though she departed after only one album, and began a long and excellent career as a solo singer. And her first solo album, \\"Chelsea Girl,\\" is a perfect example of Nico's dark, heavy, haunting songs.<br /><br />Don't expect the same stuff as \\"Femme Fatale,\\" though -- the Velvet Underground specialized in fuzzy art-rockers. By herself, Nico favored a more orchestral brand of pop. It kicks off wtith a delicate guitar solo, only to get submerged under a layer of violins. \\"Now that I'm almost not so very far behind/I want to know/do I stay or do I go...\\" she asks mournfully in the soaring opening song.<br /><br />That mellow, classical style carries over the album, with some stately organ in \\"Little Sister\\" and the urgent, flitting flute melody of \\"Winter Song\\" and \\"Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams.\\" The one disappointment is the finale, \\"Eulogy To Lenny Bruce.\\" In itself, it's not a bad song -- but the production is definitely off, making Nico sound like she's singing from inside a metal drum.<br /><br />The late Nico was a love-her-or-hate-her singer, even in her days with the Velvet Underground, where people often demanded her presence after her departure. She was also not one for people who demand  bubblegum-pop lyrics or wide-ranging vocals. Instead, she's for the open-minded, who are willing to check out something -- or someone -- a little different.<br /><br />The voice is the most prominent difference: Nico's voice was deep, deadpan, flat, and had a heavy German accent. In other words, a disaster. Except that she was't -- instead, her voice has a kind of trembly, gothic beauty, and it suits the exceptionally sad songs that she tended to sing. No goofy I-love-him-so ballads here, but meditations on life, death and tragedy.<br /><br />And the music is majestic enough to support those songs and that voice -- lots of flutes and violins, with guitar and piano backing them up. As a result, this brand of pop has aged better than most older music -- with its classical bent and European orchestral flavour, it sounds timeless. It could have as easily been recorded yesterday.<br /><br />\\"Chelsea Girl\\" was the start of a beautiful solo career for Nico, cut short by her untimely death. But she left behind her a legacy of beautiful, mournful music.ter than most older music -- with its classical bent and European orchestral flavour, it sounds timeless.

B000002J1U|4.0|After the knockout punch of Led Zeppelin's first two albums, their third album was seen as a disappointment by some fans.  Split down the middle between steam-shovel rockers and largely acoustic, folkish material, the album presents a rough blueprint for Zeppelin's towering monument.
B0000TLA9G|1.0|This compilation looks like it was put together by a bunch of businessmen in an office somewhere, who probably go home and listen to Engelbert Humperdinck in the evening. This poor attempt at a GN'R compilation DEFINETLY does not consistently represent GN'R's best work. Just look at all the covers: Knockin' On Heaven's Door, Sympathy For The Devil, Live And Let Die, Ain't It Fun, and Since I Don't Have You (that's right kids, these are not original GN'R tunes!). OVER A THIRD OF THE MATERIAL HERE CONSISTS OF OTHER PEOPLES SONGS! There's more than enough awesome original Guns n' Roses material to choose from. Where's Estranged? What about Nightrain, It's So Easy, or Out Ta Get Me? These songs are all awesome and far more appropriate GN'R tunes and they're nowhere to be seen on this shoddy compilation. Yeah, granted, it's a \\"greatest hits\\" album, but as a body of work it just doesn't represent GN'R very well. A \\"Best Of\\" would be much better.  <br /> <br />I cant in good conscience recommend this to anybody. If you are a casual fan and want to get an idea of what GN'R were about, you'd be better off asking a friend to make a mix of some of GN'R's best tunes. <br />

B000000OAN|5.0|Operatic vocals, acapella sections, fantastic and whimsical lyrics, flamboyant vocal melodies, top notch musicianship and even a kazoo solo or two.In the hands of a lesser band, all these factors could combine to make a pretentious mess. But with Queen, these come together to make a  masterpiece, A Night At The Opera.     Queen has left a indelible mark on the rock landscape. The flagship track here, Bohemian Rhapsody is one of the most known and revered tracks in classic rock. Singers and groups as diverse as George Michael and Metallica have expressed their admiration for Queen. And A Night at the Opera is generally considered Queen's masterpiece.     Why is it so good? Variety, quality, uniqueness, unpredictability and the sheer power of these songs. And of course, Freddie Mercury. His vocal performance here is one of the best of all time. Technically spectacular, tasteful, at times heartfelt and simply amazing. Mercury was one of those vocalists who could make a song better and determine the mood just by singing on it. Plus, He's supported by top notch musician, songwriter(every member pens at least one great song here) vocalists in Brian May, John Deacon and Roger Taylor. The guitar work is exciting, innovative and just fun to listen too. The bass and drums are pretty good too and keep up perfectly. Last but not least, is the genius production on this album. Listen to Bohemian Rhapsody or Prophet's Song and you'll see what I mean.     Death On Two Legs: A Night at the Opera starts out on a bitter yet wonderful note with Death on Two Legs. The song is a vicious screed against the band's former manager. The lyrics and delivery are perfect here. From the menacing instrumental sections to the great melodies, this is one of the best songs on A Night At the Opera. A/A+    Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon: What a fruity song. Mercury's vocals are jubilant and flamboyant melodies. They sound like a throwback to the 20s or 30s. Short but pretty sweet. B+    I'm in Love WithMy Car: This majestic motor vehicle tribute was penned by drummer Roger Taylor. The lyrics are just overblown. The melodies are soaring. Not one of my favorites but still good.  B+    You're My Best Friend:It's written by John Deacon, the bassist for his wife. I think I heard this in commericals or the Simpsons or something. Really catchy and Freddie Mercury's vocals are just great here. Not surprise that it was a single.  A-    5. 39': The 39th Queen song. Criminally underrated IMO. One of my favorites here. The lyrics may be about space travel but this song still really moves me. Brian May's voice is great and his melodies are just amazing. Very folksy. Great bassline too. A    6. Sweet Lady: I used to not like this song much but it grows on you. The guitar is pretty good and the melodies have their moments. Not one of the best but its still not bad. Better than a lot of tripe that passes for music these days. B    7. Seaside Rendezvous: Even more flamboyant than Lazing... and even better. The instrumentation here is really fun to observe and try to figure out. A testament to Queen's creative talent and uniqueness. I mean what kind of band has a kazoo solo that enhances the music. Cool track. A-    8. The Prophet's Song: At 8:14 this is the longest song here and perhaps the most extravagant. Another underrated epic masterpiece. Brian May wrote this about a dream he had concerning Moses and the Flood. The song has some cool non western melodies.   The first section is a hard rocking affair that's quite beautiful and heavy. The second section is lengthy voice section. Production genius. It's like 15 Freddies singing various lyrical round. Sounds pretty menacing. The final section is akin to the first and wraps up with some instrumental noodling. A/A+    9. Love of My Life: Beautiful song. The intro has classical piano and a harp. Freddie's vocals here are great and his melodies really make this song. I love the melody when he pleads \\"don't take it away from me\\". The vocal dubs are really effective here: A     10. Good Company: A little bit like Seaside Rendezvous. Written by Brian May, this track is a bouncy little number with more creative instrumentation. Listen to the great guitar rhythms here. Simply splendid. B+    11. Bohemian Rhapsody: Here it is, the masterpiece. Could possibly be interpreted as Freddie's comment on the guilt(\\"pulled MY trigger now he's dead\\")and persecution of homosexuality(\\"can't do this to me baby\\"). Or just a whimsical tale. From the dreamy vocal intro, to the heartfelt ballad, to the wall of voices, to the head bobbing hard rock to the modest conclusion, this is one of the best songs of all time. Just amazing. In terms of emotion, musicianship, production and creativity. One of those songs that   redefines what music can be. A+    12. God Saves the Queen: Could have just ended the album with Bo Rap but this isn't too bad. The guitar arrangements are interesting. B    A Night At the Opera is one of those special albums that entertains again and again. From the vicious hard rock assault of Death on Two Legs to the last guitar chords of God Saves the Queen, this is an essential album that should not be missed. If you want to know what kind of album it takes to change rock music, this is a must listen. Highly highly recommended.
B0006399FS|5.0|When i first heard the album, i thought it was okay but its an ATYCLB side B.    But after listening to it several times the songs start to grow on you. And in true U2 fashion, you begin to appreciate each song on their own. Its like they were designed to become meaningful in a staggered basis. First it was the easy to like \\"Vertigo\\" then moved on to \\"Miracle Drug\\" then it was \\"Waiting for the Crumbs\\". And everytime you get hooked on a song in this album, its like Whoa! why didn't i hear that before. I can't think of any other artist who could consistently do that for me. But U2 has been doing it ever since.     My suggestion to those who can't appreciate this album is to listen to it in different context. While at home, in a park, on bus, with your girlfriend or wife. If it still doesn't catch on then the album was not meant for you.    This album will never have the same impact to me as Joshua Tree but that was in a different time and age. I'm just happy that after 20 yrs a band like U2 could still crank out music with lyrics and tunes that can move me. In this aspect, HTDAAB does not fail.  5 stars.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This is album is different but I still love it. I like it better than Toxicity, but that's just my opinion. I like the fact that Malakian is taking a step up and doing more harmonies with Tankian. I'm satisfied. I also find it funny that the only bad review on here is by a person who can't spell thumb right:P
B00006V9A0|5.0|What can I say about Nirvana that hasn't been said already? Amazing band, very talented. Kurt Cobain had a very emotional voice that got you to feel his pain. They had great songs like; Come as you are, In Bloom, Rape me, ect. But of course they will be remembered by Smells like Teen Spirit. Very sad how the band ended with the death of Cobain. However this will be one of the bands that no matter how old the music is, you'll prolly hear your grandkids singing the songs. Legends.
B0008G2IRO|5.0|This CD is one of the best CD's! i love it! this thing never comes out of my CD player! <br /> <br />Highlights: Kids with guns, Feel Good inc., and Fire Coming Out Of a Monkeys Head. <br /> <br />The DVD has the music vid for \\"Feel Good inc.\\" and a bunch of other cool stuff too. <br /> <br />Just buy it while you can......oh, yeah, comes in a cool case too.
B00006CXXU|2.0|I have mixed feelings about this woman. I don't like her music, it's not really my taste. And I don't like the way she shows off her skinny little body. It sends bad messages to little girls. But I do love her voice. I don't care who you are and what genre of music you are into, Christina Aguilera has an amazingly beautiful voice. She is talented. I have to give her credit for her vocial abilities.
0393035158|5.0|I was introduced to this book by a 90 minute talk Sam Harris gave at a non-denominational church/temple linked with the University of Irvine.  It was broadcast on BookTV.  I was amazed by two things after the program.  First, that he was ever invited to give the talk in the first place.  His indictment of organized religion and faith is very potent and profound.  Second, I was surprised by the response of the audience of religious \\"moderates\\".  He presented a very clear and damming challenge to their core beliefs, but they did not seem to react.  After thinking about it, I realized they proved one his key points.  People just believe without thinking.  Thinking about their beliefs would cause to much mental conflict.  There are too many holes. <br /> <br />I got the book, read it, and found it to be one of the best books I have ever read.  His arguments are solid and well written.  If you are a non-believer, you will find this book validating many of the thoughts you have had in your life.  If you are a believer, I do not see how you can truly read this book without it changing you in some significant way. <br /> <br />The key point I took from the book is that we can no longer continue to quietly accept the religious beliefs of moderates or finatics.  They all must all be challenged. The moderates enable the finatics and the finatics may just get ahold of a WMD someday and they would not hesitate to use it.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Oh goodness. I do not like Britney..um...Federline. I don't like her voice. I don't like her music. And I do not like her...everything. She is pretty but that's mostly because of makeup and touchups here and there. She's Fake. But hey, good for her that she's happy, that she's pregnant, and that she has has some crappy reality show. Just as long as she stops singing for a while...I'm alright.
0380778556|5.0|Rebecca is surely the the quintessential Gothic suspense.  DuMaurier controls and modulates the atmosphere in scene after scene with wonderful descriptive passages.  The characters are simply drawn, but stay true to the tragic story.  Suspense and foreboding build steadily, even though the plot holds no surprises for the modern reader.<br /><br />I am never interested in romance novels, gothic suspense, or mysteries.  Nevertheless, I found Rebecca to be a completely satisfying read.<br /><br />While reading the novel, I felt like I was watching an extended directors' cut of the best Hitchcock movie ever.  So I was not surprised to find that he brought Rebecca to the screen and that it was his breakthrough film.  He obviously learned a great deal from DuMaurier.
B0002XDODU|5.0|I absolutely love Rammstein. Love, love, love them. The reason is this band doesn't sing in English. They sing most (if not all) of their lyrics in German. When I first heard that fact I was very sceptical. I mean you wouldn't know what they are saying...so how can I rock to it. But what I found out is..even if you don't know the language, it still rocks because of how they play. When I heard them I was blown away. They are amazing. And the German language sounds so much more..evil then ours so it's great for metal. It sounds like satan is singing himself. I recomend this band because it showed me that words are just small parts in a song.
1400031087|4.0|This is a masterfully written book.  I agree with some of the other reviewers who argue that the story itself is suspect at points -- though I'm inclined to believe the author, as I've known a few people that border on his type of crazy.  Put aside plausibility of the plot, however, and you'll be rewarded by an audacious and powerful work.  Time will tell if Frey's book falls into the company of Morrison, Faulkner, Joyce, DeLillo, et al.  Until such judgment is passed, however, know that this book is certainly a contender for their company, and should be read by anyone who loves language and loves challenges to rhetorical convention.    2008 - Very Late Addendum:  Obviously, Frey's been debunked as just so much a mythmaker.  Unfortunately, his stupid claim that the story is \\"true\\" has overshadowed what is nonetheless still a great book.  No one will probably ever know what prompted the author to lie as he did.  He can still write, though.  From a literary standpoint, the question is whether this story will pack the punch it once did given the controversy around it.  Truly a shame.
B00005ATQI|5.0|I'm reviewing the VHS edition, but from reading reviews on the excellent DVD extras, I'll probably want that edition as well.<br /><br />THE SHINING is pure and simple HORROR at its creepy best.  We are easily folded into the story from the beginning, and we hang on till the shattering ending.<br /><br />Jack and Wendy Torrance settle in as caretakes at the isolated Overlook Hotel in Colorado over the winter; their son, a kind of spooky fellow with some unearthly abilities himself, spends time riding his bike down the hotel corridors and talking to his imaginary friend, Tony.  He speaks in a different voice at times, and has visions of the young children who were murdered at the Overhook many years ago.<br /><br />Jack is a writer who grows increasingly frustrated with his wife, the claustrophobic nature of the hotel, and the writer's block that has such a strong grip on him that he literally spends hours typing the same sentence maniacally on his old fashioned typewriter.<br /><br />As we learn more about the history of the hotel, and weird visions begin occuring, like Jack having a drink at the bar (which is really compeltely barron of any alcohol) and talking with the barkeep, we begin to see just how deep into dementia this man is spiraling.<br /><br />Stephen King can take any road he wants with horror and still manage to keep the reader gasping for breath by the end.  We never lose sight of Jack's mounting rage, though he appears at time to be mellow and easy-going.  Wendy, though a devoted wife, is cooky and creepy in her own right, and despite rooting for her survival at the end, we almost want to shake some sense into her to leave the hotel way before disaster strikes.<br /><br />Having never read the novel, I cannot compare or critique the similarities or differences, but I truly enjoyed Kubrick's work here and have kept THE SHINING in my video arichive for decades.
B00008MNYS|2.0|I saw this album and I thought cool title,cool cover and it's Robbie Williams,ex Take That member.I bought it and I was like what is this?The lyrics make no sense and the music is so boring.The only good songs Robbie Williams has done are with Take That and \\"Angels\\".
068817776X|5.0|Edith Hahn Beer's story is fascinating!  She survived the Holocaust due to a remarkable combination of brains, good luck, good friends, and courage.  There is not a dull chapter in this book; it is well-written and manages to be both compelling and educational.
B000002V1D|5.0|John Taylor was the bassist not the guitarist. Get it right dummies.  This album was a surprise in 1993 and is now a classic.  I am happy that the original band is back together but Warren Cuccurilo did a great job here- great guitar sounds on Come Undone.  By the way does anyone know who the chick is in the video?  josephmarkdavis@aol.com   I read that the voice belongs to Tessa Niles on back up.
B00097DX3U|5.0|This is the next step for Audioslave and i have to say its just as good as their last step....This band has grown a little soft but they still have some great rocking tunes and this c.d. displays some of Tom Morellos best guitar work to date......and you will agree once you hear his riffs on songs such as \\"Your Time Has Come\\" and \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" and the song everyone has heard \\"Be Yourself\\" another great work is \\"Out Of Exile\\" that is a really good song........anyones Great Album i hope Audioslave continues to battle the crappy bands that are out now
B00097A5I6|4.0|Given all of the hype in the beginning and the delivery of the first two superb works, we were entitled to expect this recording years ago.  Now we have it.  No regrets just back to what we wanted.  Thanks to the brothers O.
038572179X|4.0|The quality of writing is easily worth the read but I didn't find the action of the characters creditable, beilieve the villains to be stock characters (a war profiteer, sneer, sneer) and don't think revenge on another is the way to atone for one's error.
0385336942|5.0|This moving book takes place in majestic Alaska. Louis Belk is assigned to Alaska after completing his bomb recovery training. Not just ordinary bombs, these are \\"loaded\\" air balloons floating in from Japan. Almost as problamatic as the balloons is Louis's commanding officer, a tyranical lunatic who is set on being the one to crack the secrets of the balloon bombs.  <br /> <br />This book is very well written, and exciting enough to keep you reading well into the night. The characters are interesting. Although I gave the book five stars because it is so readable and hard to put down; I did find a few flaws with it. Most notable is that the characters and their motives aren't always fully explained. But despite that, this book is still an excellent read. It reminded me of The Kite Runner; if you liked that book, you'll probably like this one too.
B000002GMT|5.0|Bee Gees and ABBA totaly dominated the airwaves during the 70's and when one listens to their music it is easy to understand why. Both bands were so dominant compared to what all the other bands released at the time. This their second hits album is just as amazing with tracks such as angel eyes, the day before you came, under attcack, summer night cirty and many more. The day before you came is probably one of their strongest tracks they ever wrote and one can definetely sense the 80's synthpop sound that would have been part of their repoitoire if they had not broken up.
0793518326|4.0|I was amazed by the completeness of this book.  All the parts are written out.  I really only use it for piano, but it is great to see what the full arrangement is. <br /> <br />It is true that it is hard to read at times.  The print is small, but sitting at the piano I can read it, even without my glasses. <br /> <br />And every song is here, even some early ones that they didn't write. <br /> <br />Every dedicated Beatles fan, that plays an instrument, should have this book.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Theres 1659 reviews on this album,and Thom, I want u to know that I'm above the rest of them to be your no. 1 fan (even to the guy who claim that Radiohead is his religion ha..ha...nice try,bro)Yes, Yes Mozart is great, Beethoven is genius, Pink Floyd is bla-bla, Beatles is yada-yada, but every generations have their own hero. This is mine. Who wants to be the best on earth if u can aim to the whole universe. <br /> <br />Magic does not just happen in Hogwarth,mind you. it could come from Oxford too. Yes, this is magic.... cause I doubt that Radiohead can make something as beautiful as this anymore. But who cares. Who needs another Ok Computer? One is enough and stick to this album for the rest of your life. <br /> <br />I love every second of this album and yes, even Fitter Happier and yes The Tourist is the best song here and not just Paranoid Android! <br /> <br />If Neil Amstrong made an album right after his trip to the moon, it should sound like this.Glimmering! <br /> <br />And please dont compare Radiohead with Pink Floyd. I dont know why, just dont.....ok :-) <br /> <br />And if u dont like this, I respect that. We're all different people. <br /> <br />I'm an avid fan, yes, and I've done my duty to give it 5 stars tho i know it needs no support anymore. If u dont like this album, call me, I'll give you your money back. Seriously!
0670033693|5.0|This is the best novel that I have read in the past 12 months. James Patterson and the other famous authors should be reading it, to remind them as to what a really great book can be, with three dimensional characters, incredible atmosphere, great intimacy with the location and the characters, and the importance of character development and interaction over (contrived) action in every chapter.
0792838068|5.0|Hey....this is not depressing at all.Its just Nicholas cage at his best. How could it be depressing? Hes funny when he's drunk. Yes its dark but isnt that beautiful? <br /> <br />Forget about the ending, the first 30 minutes is brilliant.but without the music, this would be dull to so kudos to Sting
B000002U82|5.0|The only reason you should not already own this......MASTERPIECE is because you're either really really young (like 12 or so) or you've been in a coma for last 30 some odd years. There is no other excuse. No matter WHAT type of music you like, whetever genre you prefer, this is a must have (MUST HAVE!!) album for any living human creature on this fine, often tumoltuous, planet of ours. This album transcends all differences people may have musically. I cannot reinforce that enough. This is not an album you simply LISTEN to, you EXPERIENCE this album. You live it for its (too short) running time. Pink Floyd were musical geniuses. Nothing else to say. And if you partake in the herb, then you're really in for a fine experience. Many a high school weekends were \\"wasted\\" away by experiencing \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" All the low volume speaking, often nearly jibberish will all suddenly be clear as day. And it will be as if Waters et. al are speaking directly to....YOU!!!! It's strange and I'm not sure how they pulled that off, but WOW, this album is something else. This album is simply the finest piece of musical/sensory work I have ever heard. Please, if you dont alreasy own this....BUY IT NOW. Play it LOUD, live Pink Floyd. The songs on this album almost appear as a vapor, seeping from your speakers, engulfing the listener and absorbing into your pours. It takes on an almost human quality if listened to at exactly the right volume and under exactly the right settings. Lay back, crank it up, and fly away.
B000001E7T|4.0|As if i have nothing else to review....but this is cool. The  lazy strumming guitar, the voice. It makes u feel exactly as the cover suggest:drifting.
B000002UA2|5.0|Pink Floyd must be played as loud as possible so as not to miss one beautiful, soaring note. The music must fill your lungs with every breath and seep into your soul. This album is quite simply....BEAUTIFUL. Its more \\"rock\\" Floyd than alot of their other stuff, but you can hear the trippy, hallucinogenic jam band seeping through on most of the tracks. What a group of fantastically talented musicians. I like to just let this album play and veg out to it. The music encapsulates you, and you become a part of the album. There is no better musical group ever. And there will never be another one that reach the stratosphere of talent that Floyd acheived.  I thoroughly enjoy all the songs on here, not a bad one to be found. My favorite song is 'Wot's....Uh, The Deal' which is actually one of my ALL TIME favorite Floyd songs. \\"Obscured By Clouds\\" is a must have for any Floyd devotee. A must have for any MUSIC fan!!!!!!
B000000W8C|4.0|\\"I'm gonna die alone in bedddddddd! I'm gonna die alone in beddddddddd!\\" sings Richard. And for some, thats what makes this record (see i use the word record instead of album) so essential. <br />and in Bittersweet Symphony video, probably becuz hes so tired in bed, he took a walk on the street and face the urban.  <br /> <br />
B000002KHH|5.0|These guys were the beginning of the metal scene. Although older groups such as Deep Purple gave us the first glimpse at truly \\"heavy\\" music, Sabbath was the first band to really absorb themselves in it full time. This is a fantastic album. Ozzy was such a tremendous front man, and I dont even think he can sing that well. The music Sabbath produced was heavy, overpowering, foreboding, and dark. But to listen to their songs, their lyrics, they're all about social injustices, war, mental disease, personal strife. None of that Satan Worshipping crap that one always hears. The thing you'll notice most when listening to the early Sabbath albums is the production. They intentionally turned up the volume on their bass drums and bass guitar. Thats whe gives Sabbath that heavy, hot, wet towel feel to their music. They were innovators. This is another essential piece of music that should be found in anyones music collection. Their debut, Black Sabbath, is also excellent. I would recommed purchasing any of the albums with Ozzy as their frontman. After that, they get a little shaky because they changed lead singers so many damn times.
B00004XONN|5.0|Minimalist. Sophisticated. Clean sounding. Lack of emotion-the thing of which i love so much about Radiohead.U really have to know the story to know what its all about, to enjoy the album. <br /> <br />Its not easy to listen either but i have to be very optimistic cause all the songs, seems like everything in its right place. takes time for it to grows on you. And now i cant stop playing it. Thom sings as if he wants to be a robot, a machine, a ghost sometimes. Not a fun album.Perhaps radiohead's most serious album.Is this a work of a genius? I dunno. I just cant stop playing it.When i reach home after days job, i think this album first to be played at home and the first one too at the morning bell.W. Axl Rose likes this album so much he danced salsa to the tune of National Anthem in limbo......just kidding, and thats what this album's been missing. humour. But who needs humour when the centre story is about a genetic (?) kid A.I wish i could stop playing this but i just cant make it dissapear completely.But dont be an idiotique,listen to this on headphone if u cant 'get' it.This could be your own soundtrack of your own life's motion picture. <br /> <br />I dont mention the Tressfinger cause i'm not sure if I really like that song.
B000002JS8|5.0|WOW, what a fine piece of work to call your last. Shortly after this album dropped, Ac/Dc lead screamer (and commedian) drank himself to death. What a waste. This album is his last piece of work, and what a fine piece of work it is. The thing that always makes me smile about this album is the front cover. Here are these guys who are suppoosedly SATAN WORSHIPPERS (remember those stupid, bogus stories????? Ridiculous. F*** You P.M.R.C.)and Angus is trying to look all tough with his sneer, but off to the right, with a big silly smile on his face, appearing non too threatenting......is Bon Scott, frontman, comedian extrordinarre. This band was always about GOOD TIMES. Drinkin, smokin, partyin and women. And this album is no different. Every song on here is a great hard rock tune, enjoyable from beginning to end. A must have for any music fan, and especially anyone new to Ac/Dc. RIP Bon!!!!! We love you
B0000931OG|5.0|Before this I thought that people admirer Damon just because his good looking, but after I listen to this album, boy I was wrong. This is beautiful. I cant stop playing this. I hope 13 is as good as this. <br /> <br />This suppose to be one of the best album in 2004, right?
B000002JS6|5.0|With the death of their former screamer, Bon Scott, Ac/Dc could have headed off into oblivion, being remembered for just those orignal 4 CLASSIC albums. However, they must have had someone in the celestials who liked their music, cuz they were provided with a new lead singer who sounded JUST AS GOOD as Scott. Brian Johnson took over the helms of Ac/Dc and never once looked back. Its hard to decide which frontman I like better. And they sound so similar. Back in Black is a classic tribute to Scott. And Johnson does a truly FINE job. I DONT THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO ROCK HARDER THAN THEY DO ON THIS ALBUM. Any harder and one would hurt themselves listening to it. This album is an essential for any music fan, whether or not you like metal/hard rock. This is simply great music. Songs like Hells Bells, Shoot to Thrill, Givin the Dog a Bone, Back in Black, You Shook Me All Night Long.......are classic early metal. It doesnt get better than this album. All the songs on here totally rock and will send you careening around your room/house/car/whatever like a mad person, grinding at the air guitar like Angus Young has temporarily found residence in your soul. If you're new to Ac/Dc, then aquire for youself the older stuff (High Voltage, TNT, For Those About To Rock, Back In Black, Highway to Hell, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap and If you Want Blood). The newer stuff is ok, but its these older masterpieces that really show you what a puch this band can throw. Duck, weave, ROCK
B0000508U6|5.0|Ha ...ha....ha. But seriously, this album was made to be listen alone in the dark ,then you'll know how misearable you are \\"I saw Sparkkkkkk.....I saw Sparkkkkkk\\". And for that, this debut is better than their 2nd album. <br /> <br />Yes,I am over the age of 13.
B000002NHN|5.0|I have to admit, I had really never heard of Loreena McKennitt or any of her songs before. And when I happened on her music here, I listened to the samples and was immediatly hooked! The instruments and beautiful voice are a great escape from what most radio stations are playing now. Listening, I can imagine myself along the Mediterranean or some exotic country, exploring a new place with each song. I will definitely be buying more cds from her soon.  <br />((The only song I sometimes skip over is \\"Highway Man\\", being about 8 min long, it just drags out too long.))
0140131558|4.0|What I like about Paul Auster is just that I think  plot is not really play an important part in his book (am I right?)  ....Most of his works is Just about a confuse guy wondering around in search of something. A cliche theme even for a postmodern work. But Auster is a fun author to read. <br /> <br />My fav. page is 7.And a nice choice of number indeed to start it all.
1881273156|5.0|I can't say enough about the value of this book.  I've been married now for 11-years, and credit many of the lessons in this book for helping us through the tough times.  If you're doing your best at keeping a relationship afloat, but seem to be going nowhere, read this book!  Chances are, you're not speaking the right 'language.'
B00008J4P5|1.0|I have to say this album was absolutely terrible. The drums were more basic than anything I have ever heard, the guitar was fine but not at all good. All in all I dont recomend this extremely bad/basic album.
1400031087|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I read this book in 24 hours.  Excellent.
6300268470|4.0|This was the first of Director Howard Hawks movies of this genre and shows his learning in progress as this movie moves from brilliant to stuttering. <br />John Wayne shows a wonderful character in the town lawman in a wide range of comedy and romance which he seldom got to show in movies. <br />Angie Dickinson surprisingly after a slow start really did a wonderful job in her vixen bad girl gone good. She proved she can really act when given a chance. <br />Ricky Nelson was a bit stiff in his acting delivering his one liners...but he does a nice job of singing. <br />Dean Martin should have won an Oscar for his role in portraying a drunk trying to be sober. His demeanor, his actions showed what a talent he really had if scripts allowed him to act. <br />Walter Brennan was squeeky cute as a sidekick deputy. <br />Claude Akins turned in not much of a role as a bad guy nor does Russell who plays his brother. <br />Rio Lobo is the best of this set in story and acting, but this is a nice change for a movie night sharing popcorn with someone you love. <br />4 stars because the Director and writers could have given a better story for the great acting accomplished by the actors.
B000066NW0|3.0|It was ok. What more did anyone expect? Catchy pop tunes.  <br /> <br />Just wanted more to respond to some of the other reviews. <br /> <br />One review quoted the 'bad' lyrics. Whilst not ground breaking they aren't as bad as made out by the quote because it was taken out of context. Anything can be made to look worst than it is taken out of context. In full, the lyrics don't seem that bad: <br /> <br />I like you the way you are when we're drivin in your car and you're talkin to me one-on-one. But you become somebody else round everyone else. Watchin your back, like you can't relax. You're tryin to be cool. You look like a fool to me. <br /> <br />Maybe the reviewer didn't understand the 'complicated' lyrics. <br /> <br />She should die?  <br />C'mon get a life, there are far more important things in this world than hating a girl who sings pop music for a living. There are plenty of people who deserve to die for things they have done, making teen angst pop rock isn't one of them. <br /> <br />
074322454X|4.0|I read this book after first watching the series.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that the movie was better than the book, but the book is still a worth while read.  The book is written in a very conversational style, with lots of quotes and stories from the men that fought the war, and runs about 340 pages, all of which are fast moving.  It should take about 3-5 hours to get through. <br /> <br />Taking the company thru formation and training in Alabama, through the deployment, its various battles and finally the conquest and occupation of Germany, the book brings to life what life was like for the soldiers there and their relationships between them.  Particularily interesting where the letters and the diary of one of the men, Jackson, a Harvard educated soldier whose accounts and writing really helped make the book as personal as it was.  <br /> <br />The book doesn't devote a lot of time to the nitty and gritty of battle, which I felt would have improved it quite a bit.  It closes with a \\"where did they go\\" segment which I found interesting to see how the men spent the remainder of their lives. <br /> <br />One of the spotlight reviews suggested that the book was really a smear campaign against some of the more senior level officers, and I agree that the ommission of the Battalion Commander was vastly diminishing.  I do not concur that COL Sink was unnecessarily smeared - Ambrose pointed out that the men prefered him to Taylor (The Division Commander) because he shared their dislike for war.  I also didn't see the smears against the commanders that followed Winters in E Co.  1LT Hillenger was only there for a short time.  As for 1LT Dykes, by all accounts from the men there, he was a poor leader.  It isn't Ambrose's fault for printing what the people who were there regarded as fact.  The only other qualifing comments would be those about then 1LT Spears and his alleged slaughtering of several German prisoners.  Since the allegations are so prevelent amongst themen of the company, I don't know how Ambrose could had written a factual or as interesting a history by leaving them out.  Also, it helps to remember that the book is a story as told by a collection of people at ground level of an organization.  Typically these people, as talented and as committed as they may be, do not normally see the entire picture of what is going on, and that is important to remember while reading the accounts. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a very enjoyable read, and will give the reader a great insight to the men who fought the war and what their lives were like.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|Veronica Mars encompasses everything great in television - humour, tragedy, romance and mystery and compresses it into one compelling hour of must-see viewing.  The cast is absolutely amazing and the concept, flawless with our teen heroine, Veronica Mars, employing, not brute force or promiscuity, but quick wit and intelligence to solve the many cases on her agenda - from locating a girl's lost dog to solving who really killed her best friend. <br />For anybody who wants to be genuinely entertained and astounded a the same time, forget about heavyweight shows like LOST or The OC.   Go watch Veronica Mars instead.
6303314015|5.0|I love this movie so much. I remember when it came out when I was just six. A perfectly good timing in my favorite year. That's what I miss about the 90s. I have the Simba plush toy, the Lion King song book with piano, and the umbrella. The movie is very funny especially Scar and the laughing hyenas. The sad part is how that (...) kill Simba's father. I remember being sad and crying in this part. Because it's sad how HIS own uncle would want to kill him and his father. And what's really great about it....is when Simba grows up and he falls in love wih his childhood friend Nala. Simba then returns back to the pridelands and put that (...) back into his place. The movie ends with Simba and Nala adding a special someone to the family... I don't think any other movies could ever take the place of the Lion King...it's just too special that it needs to be cherish forever and forever. I would definately recommend it for those who are not familiar with the movie. IT'S THE BEST!!!!!!!
B000001IQH|5.0|Well i have to agree with another review that any ska fan would like it. I just got into ska last summer, and i love it. and out come the wolves is awesome, and very influential to a musician. My favorite song on the album is Maxwell Murder, Matt Freeman is a lunatic! Thats a good thing though. Lets just say in five years i still wont be able to play bass like that. I just started like a month ago(after playing guitar for a year), and i can play timebomb pretty good, but damn, maxwell murder... I am so jealous. This CD kicks. Buy it...now. Unless, of course, you already have it, in which case you dont need another.
1573226521|5.0|I've read a lot of sci-fi in the past but did not really get pulled into the genre of non-fiction novels until The Beach.  Garland pulls the reader into the \\"club-med\\" experience, and if you've ever enjoyed a joint or two in your life, you'll find yourself reading about true paradise, and wishing you were there.  Unless, of course, it all goes bad.
0140441409|5.0|Most men today have not had the opportunity for a relationship with a mentor, an older, and presumably wiser male, providing the opportunity to learn through cooperative endeavor and non-judgmental advice.  <br /> <br />Marcus Aurelius, in his journal, Meditations, can certainly function as a mentor for its reader. <br />       <br />This translation is a very digestible one and has provided me with good advice and direction for many years.  I heartily recommend this book for men of all ages.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Review of all the songs: <br />1. Soldier Side: 9/10 - pretty good, the ending ties in well with the beginning of B.Y.O.B. <br />2. B.Y.O.B.: 9.5/10 - Awesome guitar riff, Awesome chorus, but I'm kind of getting tired of it from radio play <br />3. Revenga: 8/10 - Good guitar, good lyrics, but nothing special <br />4. Cigaro: 9.5/10 - Fast paced song filled with awesome riffs and runs. It's great <br />5. Radio/Video: 9/10 - A song satirizing the vanity of celebrities, pretty good <br />6. This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song: 9/10 - crazy song, where it's impossible to tell what Serj is saying with out a lyrics booklet <br />7. Violent Pornography: 8.5/10 - I like the intro, but it can get boring after a while <br />8. Question!: 8/10 - Has a pretty awesome guitar riff, but I dont really like the lyrics that much <br />9. Sad Statue: 9/10 - Awesome, nice chorus <br />10. Old School Hollywood: 10/10 - My favorite song on the album, has a robot voice, and some kind of techno beat, and awesome lyrics, just a good song. It's the least like any of their other songs so far. <br />11. Lost In Hollywood:8.5/10 - Completely sung by Daron, it's pretty slow, and can get boring after a while <br /> <br />Total: 98/110 = 89% Almost an A-
B000002L99|4.0|Development...thats what happenes with a band. This album was released with a new singer about 10 years after their first album. Diamond Dave may have been flashy...but he was also a pretty big tool...and please don't try to tell me that he is a better singer that Sammy! <br /> <br />5150 is a great album...take it for what it is though. Don't try to compare it to anything from today. Musically well written...but still characteristic of the time. Eddie continues to lead the field in technically outstanding guitarists and still remain commercially successful.  <br /> <br />And after all of that, when you want to start bashing this album and criticise Sammy, remember that he was with VH for 10 years and 4 albums and this was when VH was at their most successful. This album is a classic and should be in any rock enthusiasts collection
6300146154|1.0|To the above statement I would have to say yes. If I were to go over every film made I'd be hard pressed to find one that's more overrated. Ok, the movie has cool special effects and music. I bought the soundtrack and can get the special effects jolt I need from Lord of the Rings or some other such vehicle. I have no idea why time and time again I see glowing reviews for this very unpleasant movie. There's nothing compelling or likable that I can find in either the characters of the dialogue. Which version would I recommend of the original or the director's? Neither.
B000002KOO|5.0|This was always known as the Golden Horse Album, though the horse on the cover of the album white, and the cover is itself mostly golden. <br /> <br />I bought the album the day it was released, and have listened to it steadily since.  It's strong, soulful, crisp and timely, even today.  It's always been a great make-out album as well (BEG) <br /> <br />Many years ago, circa 1976'ish, there was a day-long concert at Jeppesen Stadium at UofHouston, featuring ZZTopp, CSN&Y, (Of whose twweters I stood up inside of before the festivities began (G) ), Foghat, and other bands.   <br /> <br />...but both sides of \\"Then Play On\\" were played between three acts, and the record got biggest applause of the day, until CSN&Y came on.  Particularly \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\"  <br /> <br />It was lots of fun, but since I'd SEEN the Fleetwood Mac that MADE the album, I was left wanting to see a banc which wasn't there, except for CSN&Y (like, duh) <br /> <br />TIN SOLDIERS AND NIXON COMING
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|So heres the thing, i never was a huge SOAD fan, mostly because i really don't like serj's voice at all. *dodges the bullets* . His voice is just so goofy and...i can't think of the words, i just never liked it. I like that Daron has more mic time, number one because well, i like it better, and number two because he wrote almost all the lyrics. they mean more to him since he knows exactly where they came from, he can sing them like they mean something to him. <br /> <br />The music structurally is very creative, like usual, but really the only one showing full potential on their instrument is John. He is a fantastic drummer. Daron knows how to write a catchy original song, but technically he never really does anything impressive...not necessarily a solo, but just something to show prowess above other guitar players. Shavo and Daron are very intermediate musicians in need of stepping up their game. <br /> <br />Lyrically, and referring to political lyrics, this band has no idea what they are talking about. In BYOB Daron screams 'why do they always send the poor?'...don't know what country hes living in but here in America there is no draft, no one is sent to a war who didnt sign up. they send THE ARMY, not the poor. In Sad Statue the chorus is 'You and me will all go down in history with a sad statue of liberty and a generation that didnt agree'...didnt agree huh? well thats why more than half the country are for the war and bush was re-elected? what do you mean not agree? they really need to do their research. and BTW, and im a very stout liberal completely against the war and bush, but facts are facts and they should learn about the country the are bashing before they start. <br /> <br />so yea, overall thou i find it an enjoyable album, i've listened to it quite a few times. its worth a spin, cuz i have weird tastes, im sure not many agree with my opinions about darons vocals and lyrics and what not...so why even take my word for it? just go hear it yourself.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watch about 10 hours of non NFL TV a month. This was the only show that increased that. I normally only watch the news, call me boring! This show was awesome, and my wife was surprised that something I liked was on TV. Then they cancelled, I went into withdrawal, started watch John Doe, they cancelled it too! :) If you haven't seen it, I HIGHLY recommend you buy it, rent it, steal it from your best friend for a week. Must see.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|After months of dissapointment in new albums, finally, Silent Force! <br /> <br />Within Temptation have been riding the line between metal and opera for years and they have perfected their sound in Silent Force. But don't let the name fool you. There's nothing Silent About it. <br /> <br />There is the perfect blend of metal noise and operatic bliss on this album. Some songs are definately more metal than others, while other songs are more opera in tone, the rest are a perfect balance. The songs on the album are laid out perfectly to give the listener a whole experience from start to finish. There wasn't a dull moment. <br /> <br />This is easily some of Within Temptation's best work. The songs See Who I am, Jillian (I'd Give My Hear), Forsaken, and The Swan Song are among the best they've ever written. <br /> <br />Silent Force has even made a listener of many people I know who'd never bothered with Within Temptation before. And that is what makes a new album great. When you can please the fans of old and attract new fans with the same sound, is there anything more you can want? <br /> <br />I only hope that Silent Force is the jump off point for the next album, and that Within Temptation continues to evolve their sound beyond this point. Though I can't imagine an album better than this. <br /> <br />This is the album of their carreer. It leaves me wanting more while completely satisfying my musical needs. I recommend this album to everyone. Get it. Let the Silent Force consume you.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|This album was obviously her best one IMO. I like every song on the album, except for like three of them (#6,10,&12). It's a R&B/Latin CD. I didn't give the album 5 stars though because I really don't think she's a good singer. Her backup singers are awesome and they make the album very listenable. The duet No Me Ames with Marc Anthony was a standout song on the CD, for him. He really outshines J.Lo. This man is truly a gifted singer, she's manufactured. I think this is why she loves Marc, because he has something that she doesn't have...singing talent.
0743454537|4.0|This is the second Jodi Picoult novel I've had the pleasure to read.  She is a master at characterization -- she can make the most unlikely voices seem real and even sympathetic.  She creates wonderful, wonderful complex and deeply nuanced relationships among her characters.  This book captures things like lasting love and sibling relationships and being thirteen and going crazy and losing a loved one (to death or to something else) as well as anyone I have ever read.  I'll agree that the ending seemed contrived and shocking -- in fact, it's a shared flaw with the other Picoult novel I recently read (Plain Truth).  If I read a third Picoult novel with the same flaw, I will be turned off.   I'm not turned off yet -- her characters are so wonderfully drawn that I can forgive a few inconsistencies (Campbell should NOT have been driving,  The only way he could get a license would be to lie about his seizure disorder.  Since he tried to hide the disorder all his life, he might have done so).
B000002MTR|4.0|This is probably the most oddball album the Red Hot Chili Peppers ever done. They were expanding on their musical canvas and even though it did not work as well as it did on 2002's By The Way with John Frusciante, One Hot Minute with Dave Navarro was not all that bad. Tracks such as \\"Aeroplane\\", \\"Shallow Be Thy Game\\", and \\"Walkabout\\" kept to the funk roots however the metal influence Navarro brought showed in the so-so \\"Warped\\", the iffy \\"Deep Kick\\", and the awful \\"Coffee Shop\\". It is interesting though \\"Shallow Be Thy Game\\" actually gave us a taste of what would happen next since it sounds like a cross between \\"Easily\\" and \\"Parallel Universe\\" off of 1999's Californication. I am a die hard Red Hot Chili Peppers fan so I give it 3 stars for the music and 1 more star for the effort that they dished out by trying to make it without Frusciante. However, on this album you can tell that the band chemistry was going to be heading nowhere which pretty much lead to Navarro's departure due to \\"creative differences\\" (as it was put on the band's website) in 1997.
0553573411|5.0|This series will be the death of me.  I cannot stop reading it.  Everything else gets put on hold while I read it.  This is obviously an old series and I picked up all three at once.  I'm a fast reader, but I took my time reading this because it was so well written and I was afraid to miss the least thing mentioned.  It took me a week to read the first and a week to read this one.  I'm not picking up the third one until I get some personal things taken care of first.  You truly fall into the lives of these characters.  I can't tell you how often I shed tears for Fritz.  What a tragic life he leads, and yet he goes on.  He has loyal friends who love him, but it's like everyone's hands are tied. It's either sink or swim, and they are definately swimming with sharks.<br /><br />Fritz does have a little bit of happiness in this novel.  He gets to spend time with Molly, his love. But even that becomes heartache when he realizes Molly is receiving visits from Regal.  I don't want to explain everything that is happening in this series, it is just too numerous to mention.  I can promise that this series is a great adventure, one not to miss.
B00000J7JO|5.0|RHCP's mission for Californication was to bury the so-so One Hot Minute (which is probably the Peppers' most forgotten album). I have to say, they were pretty successful. <br /> <br />Californication might be the Red Hot Chili Peppers most well crafted album. This album has my favorite song by RHCP, the high octane funk-meets-new wave of \\"Parallel Universe\\". The only differences between this and Blood Sugar Sex Magik (as this album is often compared to) is that this album contains a slight bit more pop, Frusciante's guitar is a bit more raw, and Flea's bass has a bit more distortion in the funk sense (which is not bad at all) and if you listen to it carefully it might remind some of how Flea played bass on RHCP's 1985 Freaky Styley, but that's just me.  <br /> <br />Anthony Kiedis's vocals are very impressive, especially on \\"Parallel Universe\\", \\"Emit Remmus\\" (or Summer Time spelt backwards), \\"This Velvet Glove\\", \\"Easily\\", and the singles \\"Otherside\\", \\"Californication\\", \\"Scar Tissue\\", and \\"Road Trippin'\\". Chad Smith's drum work is very nifty and over all the band chemistry is great. <br /> <br />Going back to the funk, they are still just as funky as ever, and as I said before the bass reminded me of Freaky Styley, especially on \\"Around The World\\", \\"I Like Dirt\\", and \\"Purple Stain\\". \\"Get On Top\\" slightly takes you back to the days of Mother's Milk from 1989.  <br /> <br />However, there is songs on here that could have used some improvement. \\"Porcelain\\" is just way too slow, though I do admit, the vocals were pretty good. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, the album is spectacular, I love it, it's great, you should get this.
B0006399FS|5.0|I absolutly loved this CD!  I have always been a fan of U2 and contrary to some of the other opinions posted here I don't think they are going downhill at all.  This CD is amazing! Awsome lyrics, themes, guitar background, and of course Bono's great voice.  Just give it a try.  If you like U2's style you will like this.  They are playing half these songs on the radio right now so I'm wondering if its so \\"bad\\"(according to some) why its so popular.  Some of the reviewers with actual good taste know where I'm coming from, as for the rest of them I'm sorry they didn't enjoy it but I have no clue as to why.  Take a chance, its worth it.
B000067CPX|4.0|True, all bands need to evolve, and every once in a while they need to come out with an album that shows a different direction and expand their musical canvas. By The Way is the second album that the Peppers have done that has went in a direction far away from the fast paced rock and high octane funk (the first was 1995' One Hot Minute) which was a staple with their other albums.  <br /> <br />For pedestrian fans of RHCP, By The Way, is very welcoming. For hardcore fans like me, By The Way is a hit or miss. You either like it or you don't. I like it, for that Anthony Kiedis's vocals are better than ever and it shows the real talent of the bands chemistry. By The Way is almost refreshing in a way with relaxing tracks such as \\"The Zephyr Song\\", \\"Venice Queen\\", and \\"I Could Die For You\\". Classic Chili Peppers shows through the Californication-sounding \\"By The Way\\", the anti-drug anthem \\"Can't Stop\\", the Freaky-Styley funk-meets-ska \\"On Mercury\\", the heavily funky bass lines of \\"Throw Away Your Television\\", and the slap bass off of \\"Minor Thing\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Don't Forget Me\\", \\"This Is The Place\\", \\"Midnight\\", \\"Tear\\", \\"Universally Speaking\\", \\"Cabron\\", \\"Warm Tape\\", and \\"Dosed\\"  are probably the most interesting tracks on the album. If you really think about it, it slightly goes back to the experimental vision they had on One Hot Minute. Though it worked better on By The Way, the violins on \\"Midnight\\" sort of kill the song at the begnning (though it recovers with an excellent chorus), \\"Universally Speaking\\" dragged too much (even though it is actually beautiful), and the Latin-flavored \\"Cabron\\" was too iffy on the vocals. \\"Don't Forget Me\\" is the best song on the album and \\"Warm Tape\\" is the worst, it's almost like \\"Porcelain\\" dragged out way too much. <br /> <br />The instruments and the vocals are of high quality, the band actually never sounded better and more cohesive, though at times Chad Smith is almost non-existant. But as many people know Anthony and John Frusciante did steal the show, which kinda made Flea seem dead at times. But that's just me being of the nitpicking nature. The harmonic and the melodical styles they display on here makes this a pretty good album. <br /> <br />However, would I want more albums by the Peppers like this in the future? God no.
B0007OCG4W|2.0|You'll never have wished so much for the straight antiseptic bitterness of a Neil LaBute movie like you will after Mike Nichols' faux-pissy Closer, a movie whose rhythm becomes so familiar so quickly, it feels like a bit of a template.  Take four pretty, fuzzily conflicted upper-crust socialites, separate two of them in a room, engage in an acrimonious Q&A session, and Rotate!  For the most part, the whole mood is so uninvolving and the characters just unconvincing enough to make you feel about as stimulated in this dirty laundry as a bad Us Weekly column.  I say for the most part, because its jumps in time are alluring, and there is one notable exception to the ho-hum characterizations by the A-list cast: Clive Owen.  he is so seething and bilious in every second of the movie, he's impossible to take your eyes off of, and even manages the only interesting moment in the movie for Natalie Portman (Jude Law and Julia Roberts coast for the whole thing): for a minute during that vicious tete-a-tete in the strip club, the movie has some bite.  For the rest of the movie, you may settle for chewing off your leg.
B000002LQR|5.0|Blood Sugar Sex Magik represents the Red Hot Chili Peppers at the top of their game. Masterfully fusing adrennalized funk and textured rock, this album became instantly a classic.  <br /> <br />Energized funk dominates the album as it shown through \\"The Power of Equality\\" (I don't know why that wasn't released as a single), \\"If You Have To Ask\\" (excellent bass by Flea), \\"Suck My Kiss\\" (which has the best bassline ever recorded and is the best song on the album), \\"Mellowship Slinky In B-Major\\" (great guitar riffs), \\"The Righteous & The Wicked\\" (which has the most impressive background vocals ever done by John Frusciante), and the ever-popular \\"Give It Away\\" (you have to hear how Frusicante's funk guitar was fused with the juice harp), and Naked In The Rain (besides Suck My Kiss this is the best work Flea has done on bass). <br /> <br />Most people love the ballads of BSSM, which include \\"Breaking the Girl\\" (where it seems funk rock meets classical music), \\"I Could Have Lied\\" (the saddest song you'll ever hear), and \\"Under The Bridge\\" (with the soulful closing). <br /> <br />Flea's melodical magic is also shown through the melodical/sleazy funk of \\"Funky Monks\\", the title track, \\"Sir Pyscho Sexy\\" (the 2 1/2 minute instrumental at the end is the best that I have ever heard), and the New Orleans-flavored \\"Apache Rose Peacock\\", the fast paced \\"The Greeting Song\\" and the ode to the late Hillel Slovak \\"My Lovely Man\\" (Slovak died three years earlier).  <br /> <br />Pedestrian fans of the band will probably prefer 1999's Californication and 2002's By The Way (and don't get me wrong they are both great), but the real hardcore fans of the band, like me, will uphold this 1991 masterpiece and 1989's masterpiece Mother's Milk as the pinnacle of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay's third studio effort and follow-up to the wildly successful 'A Rush of Blood To The Head', is an album made to sound as epic as its band. From the opening cosmic waves in `Square One', Chris Martin and the group are unmistakable in generating a record far more massive than its predecessors. That isn't to say however, that `X&Y' is too distant from the band fans have come to adore, but everything here is significantly amplified. <br /> <br />Vocals and lyrics alike are soaring to places they've never been. The rocking-ballad `Fix You' grapples with loss, while the first single `Speed of Sound`, proclaims of the everyday miracles in life. All the while, Martin pushes his falsetto higher, lower, and deeper than before like `Swallowed In The Sea', a subtle arrangement that develops into a powerhouse performance. <br /> <br />Guitarist Jonny Buckland and bassist Guy Berryman have never forged melodies that detract from their front man and this disc is no different. Instead, the two deliver crisp, powerful riffs that assist in crafting an album of ever-increasing ambition. Notably though, Will Champion's mechanized drum patterns are skillfully in line with the layers of electronic synths present through most of the LP. <br /> <br />The question on everyone's mind is whether their grandeur exceeds their expectations, and both are towering. As is the trend, Coldplay continue to diversify their palette with 'X&Y', borrowing tricks from Kraftwerk to U2, and still maintaining a dignified style all their own. The raspy, intimate crooning in 'Sparks' is gone, as is the delicate and simplified 'Amsterdam'. But while 'X&Y' may challenge the older fans, that has always been the purpose and is what makes this the quintet's most significant release yet.
0440241413|5.0|The hapless Becky Bloomwood is definitely her own worst enemy, but nevertheless I found her to be such a likable character that I rooted for her throughout all of her self-created agonies.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for well-written light reading.
0780631684|5.0|I enjoy watching Final Destination and Final Destination 2; and I hope that they come up with a Final Destination 3, 4, 5,... that are as entertaining as the first two.   <br /> <br />Final Destinations are unique among slasher films.  There is no scary monster going to jump out and get you.  It is Death that sets off chains of events that lead to death.  (I wondered how Death could be the means and the end (death)in The Seventh Seal.  How odd that a lark of a slasher film would answer that question.)  Sometimes Death gets no one; and sometimes it gets someone else instead.   <br /> <br />As each domino in an incident falls, you're led to believe that whoever is the current focus will die in a particular way.  For example:  A man shoots at a bird on the wing (Please miss!).  The bullet misses and hits a tree branch instead (Thank heaven!).  The branch falls and breaks a power line that whips back and hits the man, who fries (That was weird!).  That is only a couple of sets of cause and effect.  Insert several sets of cause and effect between a first and last and you have each incident in Final Destinations.   <br /> <br />The fun is in being misled by the clever twists that run through the chains of events that lead to death.  Final Destinations are not serious treatments about cheating death--they're not meant to be.
B0006399FS|3.0|I had great hopes for this album, which had been hailed by advance reviewers as U2's big comeback, their finest album in a long, long time.    Needless to say, I was underwhelmed.  There are a lot of songs on the album that show promise, most notably \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", which builds up a great head of steam but fizzles when it gets down to the chorus.  Many of the other songs are simply dull, taking their time and going nowhere.    The only real standout tracks are \\"All Because of You\\" and \\"Vertigo\\".  Even those two seem to fall short of expectations.  The worst part of this is that U2 is trying so hard on this album to recreate their \\"classic\\" sound.  The glory days of \\"The Joshua Tree\\" are long gone, and it's time to give up the ghost.    \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" is innocuous, but is also just plain boring.  U2 can't count on its fans to shell out every time they release an album, especially not one as tired as this.  3 stars, and I'm sorely tempted to give lower.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Americans these days talk of something they call `a guilty pleasure'. Something they shouldn't enjoy - often due to so-called political correctness - but nonetheless do. When I see Daredevil, I understand the feeling. This film contradicts many values I try to stand for. There is brutal, gratuitous violence - including a murder played for laughs in one scene - a brash, flash superficiality and much else besides, which smacks of what John Paul II called `the culture of death'.<br /><br />Yet I've found the film strangely compelling. At one level, I grew up with American superheroes - and my inner teenager finds something `cool' about a Catholic superhero. Yes, here we have a superhero whose origins are not only explicitly Catholic - but who continues to practice as an adult.  (He goes to confession twice in the film).<br /><br />Moreover, the film is filled with Catholic imagery. The iconography of a neo-Gothic church dominates the movie. A church bell restores the tormented young Daredevil to a sense of peace - and so forth. All of this is perhaps more important than it first appears. As I wander through modern culture, I increasingly feel the poverty of the sacred. There are so few visible reminders of life's mystery and depth. So much of what we see only proclaims a utilitarian efficiency and functionalism. Not to mention, countless exhortations to consume, consume, consume. Here in Daredevil we find a world significantly more replete with the kind of visual and aural reminders of the sacred that has always been distinctive to the Catholic vision.<br /><br />Alone, none of this would suffice to redeem this dark comic-book film, did it not offer something else. That something else - in spite of everything - is heart. On a second viewing, I was surprised by how much human-ness breaks through the admittedly crass modernism and violence. Arguably, the central message of the film turns out to be: mercy. There is also something very touching about Daredevil's commitment to the innocent. And, as opposed to other superhero films, which promote infantile ideas of grandiose power, we have here a human being who visibly suffers. In conscience, psyche and a pain-wracked body. Here, Ben Affleck as Daredevil gives a moving performance.<br /><br />Despite everything, the film has feeling. The film also appears to be less the product of a Hollywood assembly line and more the personal vision of one man: writer-director Mark Steven Johnson. On a second viewing, I couldn't help but think: in many ways, Mark Steven Johnson may have succumbed to the harsh commercial culture of modern Hollywood - yet underneath it all, something breaks forth in his film that is tender, very human and points in surprising ways to the power of the Catholic Mystery.<br /><br />Postscript: I'm going to sit on the fence here. Elsewhere on Amazon, I've provided reviews, which speak to the possibility of a Catholic renaissance addressing the increasingly soulless robot-icisation of our culture. To recommend a brutal and in some ways, vacuous mainstream Hollywood movie in the midst of this, doesn't sit entirely comfortably with me.  I wrote the above review some time ago in another context - never used - a time when I was younger and less serious than I feel today. Looking at it now,  I'm not entirely sure how I'd feel about this film. But I do believe, as Benedict XVI has emphasised, that `the action of Christ and the Spirit outside the Church's visible boundaries must not be excluded' and that testimony to the redemptive power of mercy, humanness and Christ must not be overlooked - even in the most unlikely of places.<br /><br />Also - this review refers to the theatrical version, not the director's cut, which I believe is more brutal and may cut some of the Catholic aspects (at least one of the confession scenes for example).mitment to the innocent.

0380789035|5.0|\\"American Gods\\" is full of paradoxes, as any good novel should be.  It's an epic that's limited in scope, a road trip that isn't linear, a mystery whose principal crime(s) aren't revealed until the ending, a romance between a man and his dead wife.  It is every bit as odd and unique as these quotes suggest.<br /><br />It's also an endlessly imaginative, well-told story, with memorable characters, a surprising amount of depth and a killer twist.  The dark and witty humor is also to be savored.<br /><br />Gaiman excels in this novel, which is far better than his previous ones.  \\"American Gods\\" is predominantly about religion and America, as can be surmised from the title.  But it quietly and eloquently makes its points about these two major topics, which could easily be wielded like a blunderbuss to bash in their message.  Gaiman's superb pacing and lack of pretention also help.  The prose is simple, crisp and clean, easy to breeze through.  But tearing through this novel will likely cause a reader to miss many of its subtleties, no matter how tempting speed-reading it is.<br /><br />I would whole-heartedly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys fantasy, as well as readers of Gaiman's previous work.  This is a great piece of fiction, and an immensely enjoyable read.
B0007DAZW8|4.0|Human After All is a slight return to Daft Punk's sound on Homework, but with a more formulatic approach than their last two albums. The end result is something that is perhaps more enjoyable for a mainstream listener- something simplistic, heavy on the guitars, and very funky. It emphasies the \\"Robot\\" gimic of Daft Punk far more than Discovery did. It also has it's weak points though, the most obvoius being the almost unoticiable (but careful) editing of the Break Water song \\"Release the Beast\\" which was used as the main sample for Robot Rock. Also all of the songs, (as stated above) seem to follow the same formula: Intro, voxed vocal sample, guitar riff, synth line, voxed vocal sample, guitar riff, repeat until bridge, then either end the way the song began or use some bizzare noise outro.<br /><br />This being said, this does not mean HAA is a bad album. It is in fact quite good, and probably more enjoyable than Homework. It seems to fit the needs of a listener looking for something also a little more 'electrified' and less ploddy than Discovery. Be forewarned though: This is definently not the acid-house that old school fans of Daft Punk loved. This is a more mainstream, user friendly Daft Punk.

B0000048CP|5.0|Yes folks, this is pure black metal. Quorthon is a black metal god, and this recording proves it.

You don't know black metal if you don't know Bathory.
B0007GAERG|4.0|After the monumental disaster that was `Glitter,' Mariah Carey had to act fast if she wanted any hope of reviving her career. The comeback disc, `Charmbracelet,' failed to do so. It just barely sold platinum (thanks heavily to Mariah's hardcore fans, who were likely in a state of desperation at the time), but the songs totally flopped on radio and the singles weren't half as successful as Mariah's previous works (Mariah is such an obscenely popular diva, though, anything with her name on it would sell to at least some extent). She was perhaps at her deadliest point by then-a highly publicized breakdown, an attempted comeback album that ended up being just plain vanilla (I personally believe it was one of the worst albums of her career, bettering only its God-awful predecessor), and dangerously dwindling radio success. Mariah was in grave danger of fading out of the music world entirely. Enter `The Emancipation Of Mimi,' her latest effort, which debuted at #1 and scored her the first #1 single she's had in a while (\\"We Belong Together\\"). And justifiably so, as it effortlessly outdoes both `Glitter' and `Charmbracelet.' This release also gifted Mariah a solid spot on R&B and hip-hop radio (which is what the majority of this disc is made up of, recalling her `Butterfly' and `Rainbow' days). The puzzling title hints that Mariah (or `Mimi') is freeing some until-now-unknown facet of herself, but on the cover, she reveals herself to be...well, someone who looks an awful lot like Beyoncé. Whether this is a brilliant commercial move or a simple sellout is arguable (it is a change Mariah was likely in need of). And she certainly does Beyoncé herself up here, shredding almost any and all pretense of sugary adult contemporary in favor of a sexier, slicker R&B ride. The opener and lead single \\"It's Like That\\" is a catchy, mid-tempo hip-hop romp with slick production and fun lyrics. A nice, light, fun song you can bounce to. Most of this record is a sweet fusion of R&B, pop, and light hip-hop. These three genres come together quite nicely in smash follow-up single \\"We Belong Together,\\" in which a mellow, funky, R&B-pop beat creamily moves along sweetly heartfelt lyrics. Mariah sounds like she cares about this song, her vocals are passionate. That combined with the velvety, lush production make this an ultimately irresistible ballad. The percolating \\"Shake It Off\\" is most worthy of being the third single. Its bouncy, hip-hop-lite beat is very reminiscent of \\"It's Like That.\\" The chorus is infectious, and for once Jermaine Dupri doesn't destroy the song (as he does on \\"Get Your Number,\\" likely the worst dance track here, in which he tries embarrassingly hard to be Nelly). Many critics raved over \\"Say Somethin',\\" Carey's duet with Snoop Dogg, calling it the album's `best dance track,' but I disagree. In fact, it's just barely a `dance' track. Snoop Dogg growls over a laid back Neptunes beat, as Mariah lazily coos a chorus which doesn't seem to have a recognizable hook. I'm not saying it's bad-one of the better ones here, in fact. It's a nice slower song to groove to. Aside from Mariah's duets with rappers, the rest of this disc is heavily composed up of `70's/`60's-ish soul, with small fragments of contemporary pop blended in. \\"One And Only\\" and \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" are other sweet, funky ballads. There are more dance tracks than most of Mariah's albums, which is a nice change, but there are still more ballads than necessary. And as for her voice, which seems to be the central debate of these reviewers, no, it isn't quite as marvelous as her early days-there are notable points in which it sounds cracked and damaged, but the girl can still sing better than many of her peers, and none of the vocals are poor enough to truly mar the record (although she hits one noticeably sour note in \\"Your Girl\\"). Her trademark dog-whistle is absent throughout the majority of the record, which isn't necessarily bad-just because you can do it doesn't mean you should overuse it-Justin Timberlake made the fatal error of obscenely overusing his Michael Jackson-esque shrieks in his solo record, but thankfully Mariah only makes that mistake one or two times (and she actually fails in the ending of \\"It's Like That,\\" where she tries to hit an extremely high note but just ends up screaming. It luckily is brief and not enough to damage the delightful dance track). Minimal missteps aside, this is Mariah's best album in years, and it is a sweet, light, fun, uplifting listen. I can finally safely say this: welcome back, Mariah.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|OK, I had a HUGE epiphany while watching this for the fourth or fifth time recently. Not only is it the outstanding, better-than-the-first sequel others have described. Not only is X2 the truer heir (in my humble opinion) to the title of modern-day myth than the one that sold its soul to special effects and \\"enhanced versions\\" (try enhancing Haydn Christiansen's acting! but I digress)  But X2 is also a biting, subversive statement on the present political coup. <br /> <br />I submit in evidence the scene near the beginning, after the attack on the President, when the Professor is discussing damage control:   <br /> <br />Storm: \\"They could reinstate the mandatory registration act.\\" <br />Prof.  \\"Or worse, the President could declare a state of emergency...\\" <br /> <br />Also, the scene between the Senator and Stryker--hell bent on war! Producing \\"evidence\\" of a threat at the school. <br /> <br />And near the end, again in the President's office, when Wolverine says \\"We'll be watching you.\\" Anybody see Whoopie's recent stand-up TV special?   <br /> <br />These are only some examples of what struck me. Look for it next time around and you'll be surprised. The metaphors flying around this movie are like the pinballs of iron in Magneto's scene.  <br /> <br />Great, great cast! And no one could be better cast as Wolverine than Hugh Jackman. Fantastic story-telling: Magneto and Mystique in the gray area between good and evil.  <br /> <br />This is the true lineage of the classic superhero comic, brought to the big screen. Uses the special effects to support the story rather than becoming the story. THIS will be a tough act to follow--but you can already anticipate the confrontation between Pyro and Iceman.  <br />

0743201140|3.0|I anxiously awaited the arrival of \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths,\\" much like waiting for the return of my beloved pet at the end of a day, with great expectations. Irrespective of a general happiness about my life, I harbor a subtle element of discontent. It is a feeling that my life may not be fulfilled, that my career will not provide the greatest satisfaction for me, that I might never find the right one. It is a lack of conviction about my life's mission or purpose. I had always shunned self-help books, because I thought I knew best how to lead my life. But after years of discontent, I figured I could use some help to resolve some uncertainties in my life. Hence, I eagerly waited, and I was disappointed.    Marcus Buckingham & Donald Clifton point out that the mission of organizations and educational institutions should be to enable people to discover their strengths and to perfect them. But in reality, people tend to identify their weaknesses rather than their strengths. People expend great energy to remove such weaknesses, so that they may become well rounded. The authors note that this is completely wrong. Instead, people should learn to focus on their strengths and maximize their potential by winnowing away the weaknesses. Authors call this finding ways \\"around\\" the weaknesses.     Of the three factors that go into building strength: talent, skill and knowledge, talent is paramount and is enduring. The authors define talent as \\"any recurring pattern of thought, feeling, or behavior that can be productively applied.\\" The cornerstone of the authors' argument is that talent is chief over skill and knowledge because of its biological origin. We are good at what we do because of certain synaptic pathways that we developed as adolescents. And because our neural network does not change until advanced age, our talents are enduring. If we do not align our talents with what we do, then we will grow weary (counter-productive). If we find the right talent to develop inour lives, then we will blossom and be fruitful (productive). For instance, the authors cite Warren Buffet, who said, \\"I get up every day and have a chance to do what I love to do, every day. If you want to learn anything from me, this is the best advice I can give you.\\"     This is plausible and sounds like an aphorism to abide by. But is it possible to find and hone one's strengths? I'm not certain; I found the authors' thesis a bit hard to swallow. For example, what should become of those who can never practice the trade that suits their strengths? For every example that the authors cite of people who discover and use their strengths to great effect, even in their old age, there surely exists many more who do not. Must that mean that the mass of mankind must lead unfulfilled lives? For all my skepticism, I would like to close with a great point that the authors make, that \\"talents, like intelligence, are value neutral.\\" Hence, it is up to each one of us, whatever our talents may be, to put it to good use. But, then again, I knew that without reading the book, and so did you.

Collin's six steps for turning a company great are: <br /> <br />1) CEO's who combine personal humility with professional will. <br />2) First Who...Then What: having the right people in the company. Eliminating week employees and hiring intelligent ones with a desire to help the company grow.  <br />3) Confront the Brutal Facts: Have faith that the company will prevail in the end.  But, at the same time, confront the reality of the situation.  <br />4) Hedgehog Concept: Find something you are passionate about, that drives your economic engine and you can be the best at  <br />5) A culture of Discipline: Establish a company of culture not tyranny. Find Self-disciplined people and give them freedom and responsibility.  <br />6) Technology Accelerators: Technology is not the cause of greatness, but it can be used to help a company.   <br /> <br />Reading this book and fallowing these steps will help a manger or executive understand what is needed to turn a company in to a great company. I recommend this book to anyone trying to improve their company.  <br />
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Arcade fire, a band with a reputation of just hype,hype,hype. To give them some credit they do deserve it but not to the point of it being one of the greatest bands. Sure, they're great live and sure they're album is mind-blowing beautiful. Still, the songs isn't exactly original. But still, I'll give them credit so I'll go into greater detail of how great Funeral is.  <br /> <br />It begins with the song Neighborhood#1 a single clear crisp piano blares out and has Win Butler's soar into the song reaching a crecendo of musica.  <br /> <br />2nd song is the Neighborhood#2, the most post punkish (I guess)song on the album. A very good song i might add. <br /> <br />Une Anee... Third song a french uptempo song sung by the french mistress...its cute <br /> <br />Neighborhood#3 Could be the most intense song with Butler's voice filled with passion and emotion of a lost loved one maybe? Who knows, but whatever it is it is pissed. <br /> <br />Neighborhod#4 One of the slower songs, some might say boring (gasps) but whaever I like it for somereason, maybe because i was depressed at that time.... <br /> <br />Crown of Love- Um I hate this song actually, the lyrics are pretty trite and corny.  <br /> <br />Wake up- I also hate this song... <br /> <br />Haiti- It good interesting. <br /> <br />Rebellion- Its there single must be good right? <br /> <br />In the backseat- Chick sings it and she has some power vocals or maybe its computerized? <br /> <br />Overall, it is definitely satisfying to the picky ears or to the non picky ears.
0385512058|5.0|As much as many (competent, but charming challenged) people like to believe it's what you know that counts, it really does turn out that it is who you know that's more important.  Many talented and smart people are shy and either avoid situations or overcompensate for it with bravado or worse, arrogance.  The bottom line is that shyness can be overcome if you had a way to do it.  Ferrazi's book is that way.  It makes sense, it feels right and it's doable.  I wish I had read this book twenty five years ago, but using it now I am hopeful it can still teach an old dog new tricks.  It is something every person graduating from college should read.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I understand how Interpol's music can put people to sleep or how it is unoriginal. But, still their music is pretty damn good esp. Turn On the Bright Lights when the starting track begins it takes people into another place and it journeys into hope. Even though at first naked listen it sounds very moody and meloncholy it actually beams off hope if you listen carefully, its not all in vain. That what makes this album great and Bank's lyrics is an added bonus of course. Its not this straight forward \\"honey, I love you\\" type thing, but it makes you search for meaning making the songs more than a love song but an epic.
B00005U18E|4.0|Graeat comedy with heart. Perfect ending. Renee does a super job with the physical comedy, and being believable as a British \\"singleton\\".
B0001AP12G|5.0|1. Intro - (Skit)      2. We Don't Dare - 5/5 - Great way to start off the album, catchy chorus with pretty hot lyrics.      3. Graduation Day - (Skit)       4. All Falls Down - 5/5 - Really feelin this song too.  I don't like it as much as I used to because all the radio play it got.  I tend to lean away from songs the more I hear them but I still like this one.       5. I'll Fly Away - (Skit)       6. Spaceship - 5/5 - I love the beat on this song.  The chorus is nice and the lyrics are good.  Consequence does a nice job on his verse also.    7. Jesus Walks - 5/5 - Good message, love the beat.  This is the 2nd single, didn't get overplayed so I still like it.     8. Never Let Me Down - 5/5 - Probably one of my favorite tracks on the album.  Kanye and Jay-Z both do nice jobs with their part.  I really like the sort of 'poetic' part at the end of the song, it's hot.    9. Get Em High - 5/5 - Talib Kweli and Common are the guest appearances, they both do a nice job.  Kanye comes hard with his verse and chorus, nice beat also.     10. Workout Plan - (Skit)    11. The New Workout Plan - 4/5 - This track is very catchy.  Nice flow and chorus, could of done without the long outro part though cause that was annoying.     12. Slow Jamz - 4/5 - This song is decent, don't like it as much as I used to though.  Kanye Wests verse is decent, Twista spits fire like usual though.  Jamie Fox brings in a nice mellow chorus also.    13. Breathe in Breathe Out - 5/5 - I really like this track.  When I heard Ludacris was on the track I was like this should be good.  But Luda only does the chorus so I was sort of disappointed.  But Kanye drops 3 nice verses and Luda brings in a nice chorus to cap the song off.      14. School Spirit Skit 1 - (Skit)    15. School Spirit - 3/5 - Wasn't feeling this song very much but it's ok I guess.    16. School Spirit Skit 2 - (Skit)    17. Lil Jimmy Skit - (Skit)    18. Two Words - 5/5 - Love the beat, lyrics, and chorus.  K West and Mos Def drop hots*** on this track.  Freeway sort of ruined it for me though at the end, his part was weak.    19. Through the Wire - 3/5 - I'm not really in to this 'spit it through the wire' thing, he sounds stupid.  He shouldn't of done it but I guess it worked out for him.  I personally don't like it though.    20. Family Business - 5/5 - Amazing song and concept, some will like it and some won't.  I like the chorus.     21. Last Call - 5/5 - Kanye drops a little bit of lyrics for us then takes us on a trip through memory lane.  He takes us back into time and talks about all he did to get to be where he's at now, singed with Rocafella.  It's interesting but at the time filler, I'll let you be the judge on that.    64/70 = 5 Stars    *Final Thoughts*  Hot, hot album but way to many skits, I hope 'Late Registration,' Kanye's new album, doesn't have that many skits.  His content is good but he needs to work on his lyrical ability, I can name tons of rappers that are better than him at this.  This album got 5 stars because he made up for most of the weaknesses with other things.  So all around it was a 5 star album but not 5 stars for every aspect of it.  I can't wait for his new one, I'm looking foward to it.
B000002MY3|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the best album ever made in music history. Every song is good. <br /> <br />All I Really Want- 4.5/5 <br />You Oughta Know- 5/5 <br />Perfect- 5/5 one of my favorites <br />Hand In My Pocket- 5/5 ausome! <br />Right Through You- 4/5 <br />Forgiven- 4/5 <br />You Learn- 5/5 my favorite song in the album <br />Head Over Feet- 5/5 one of the happy songs <br />Mary Jane- 5/5 one of my favorites <br />Ironic- 5/5 arguable the best song in the album <br />Not The Doctor- 5/5 one of my favorites <br />Wake Up- 4/5 not one of my favorites but still good <br />Your House- 5/5 though the lyrics are not original <br /> <br />This is a great album overall! It sold 16 million copies in the US and 30 million copies world wide. And in my opinion, it's the best album ever created in music history. <br /> <br />
0380778556|5.0|When the narrator (Name unknown) overwhelmingly accepts Maxim De Winter's unanticipated marriage preposal, she finds herself in a horrible nightmare as the new \\"Mrs. De Winter\\" of the enchanting home of Manderley.  It is in her new high rank as the head mistress of Manderley that she undergoes the many harships of replacing the notorious, beautiful, and powerful, late wife of Maxim's, Rebecca.  Du Maurier beautifully crafts her heroine, touching on each and every painstaking moment she must endure of being the \\"replacement.\\"  The surrealness of Manderley, the timelessness of the characters, and an unforgettable twisting climax, all contribute to this stories ease of capturing every reader's heart.  The love I have for this story stretches far beyond this simple summary.  Read it; and don't tell me you loved it, because I already know you will.
B00009V7OL|4.0|This film is really good, and the DVD is as comphrehensive and mind-blowing as anything I have ever seen of a 2-disc special edition.  <br /> <br />The film is very good, and the effects are incredible (the pseudopod sequence is one of the best effects Hollywood has ever given us), but the cutting of certain scenes in this film is so bad (because there were many scenes that were cut that had to be in this film, and the film's story does not come together at some points. The 1989 theatrical version was very good though, and the acting, the effects and the connection between the two leads was outstanding. <br />In 1992, James Cameron released The Abyss Special Edition. This version had 28 minutes of new footage (inculding a wave sequence that was too expensive to finish during production) and it also fleshes out the characters much better than the Theatrical Version did. This version is better than the theatrical version, and it is practically James Cameron's definitive version of The Abyss. <br /> <br />Theatrical Version Rating: 7/10 <br />Special Edition Rating: 8.5/10 <br /> <br />The DVD is huge, depending on which one you have (The Single Disc Version, or the far superior 2 disc version (that is the single disc version plus a disc with a lot of special features and hidden easter eggs)  <br /> <br />Disc One Contains the orginial 2 1/2- hour 1989 Theatrical Version and the 3-hour 1992 Special Edition Version, both with 5.1 and 2.0 sound, and a text commentary for both versions. <br /> <br />Disc Two Contains A lot of Special Features, inculding a 60 minute documentary \\"Under Pressure: The Making of the Abyss\\" and SO MUCH MORE..... <br /> <br />DVD: 10/10 <br /> <br />Overall: 8.5/10 <br /> <br />If you only like the theatrical version, buy this DVD. If you only like the special edition, buy this DVD. I highly recommend this DVD.
B00005AFMT|4.0|As of this writing, this album is 24 years old.  My God.  Has it been that long?  This album stands out as unique in my 200+ whatever collection of CDs.  There is just nothing to compare it to.  Is it rock?  I'd say no.  It's not dance music.  But it's very intense electronic guitar oriented music.  Excellent drumming and stick bass.  Sweet vocals.  So unformulaic.  The electronic guitar feedback at the end of Thela Hun Ginjeet is simply orgasmic.
B00008O0WN|3.0|No wonder it's the final journey:  we've conquered the 7 wonders of the technological world, but it's still \\"men\\" who go to battle, send there by that cheese-grater voice of Captain Janeway.  And gender is still a viable construct, with Data, the man-made male machine with no genetalia, going out with a big bang in the end.  Hope it was good for him.  It was just okay for me.
B0007TKNIS|2.0|I seen the orginal cast on broadway and then seen it a few years later, when i saw the movie on dvd. It was great but had no real feeling of the story, When i saw it on broadway, i felt for christine, the phantoms torment.  don't get me wrong the actors, the production was great, but the story is a love story and should have some emotion to it. i am preferenced to the musical
6304779356|5.0|This movie, in my opinion, is the best vampire movie so far. I've never really watched any Vampire movies before this one came out, so I don't know about older films, but as for then until now, its the best. As for it being a horror movie, I don't think so. Its a really good Thriller, like most vampire movies. I think the only vampire movie that would even come close to horror would be Bram Strokers Dracula. Interview with a Vampire is also a really good Vampire movie, but I still love the Lost Boys the best. Maybe because I grew up watching that movie. Anyway,this movie is definitly worth buying.....
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I was introduced to Wicked through one of my teachers and decided to listen to it. I listened to the samples and thought that it sounded good so i decided to buy it. I have to say i've never taken it out of my cd player and I listen to it going to sleep. I kept on telling myself to stop listening to it so much because sometimes it will start to lose its feel after a while , but I simply couldn't and I have to say it hasn't lost its touch. I think all the cast sings wonderfully. Idina and Kristin are awesome and fit their characters perfectly.     My favorites:  No One Mournes the Wicked  The Wizard and I  What is this feeling  Dancing Through Life  Popular  One Short Day  DEFYING GRAVITY  Thank Goodness  As Long as You're Mine  No Good Deed  March of the Witch Hunters  For Good    As you can see pretty much the whole cd.  I HIGHLY recomend buying the CD and seeing the Musical!
B00082IJ08|5.0|I bought Gorllaz, the new White Stripes and Coldplay all the same day.  Guess which has been played the most?  OK, the Stripes got the early nod, but this Gorillaz cd is addicting.  Far better, beginning to end than their first offering.    Poor Coldplay hasn't been able to squeeze into the rotation yet..
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This cd is system of a downs best. They did not sellout when making this album well. It has some funny songs in it as well. the only thing about this cd is system sings a song that makes fun of top 40 bands and how they are on the radio however system of a down is just like that they are overplayed on the radio too even thow it is not their falt
0446677450|5.0|After reading Rich Dad/Poor Dad, a question posed in the book kept echoing in my head: Who is in debt to you? I gave considerable thought to the fact that most people I know are in debt to other people and no one (other than their kids) owe them money. I began to ponder further: Do I know anyone positioned to receive passive (real estate) or portfolio income on a regular basis? The answer was NO. After much discussion, my husband and I decided to purchase investment real estate rather than personal property first.  This was the best investment decision we could have made. Here we are at age 34 with three apartment buildings and finally our own home.  As a teacher, I also encouraged my school to allow me to teach a financial literacy class to interested students.  The students enjoyed the \\"rat race\\" game and key lessons about the distinctions between earned, passive, and portfolio income.  Personally, I cannot thank Robert Kiyosaki enough for opening my eyes to the possibility of financial freedom.  Due to this book, I believe financial freedom will be a reality for us before our retirement years.   <br />   <br />
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Good day/evening , this cd was ok not good dj starstream(sid wilson) did not play in alot of the tracks there new masks suck and not once do they sing about themselves being heretic they sold out on this one. However that is not to say all its songs suck the nameless was pretty cool so was danger. You have to really be in to slipknot to actually buy this cd their best cd was their selftitled
B00001OH7O|5.0|Hunky Dory (1971.), David Bowie's fourth studio album<br /><br />David Bowie is arguably one of the greatest solo artists of all time and his unique alternative style (notice the omission of the word 'pop') is timeless and has deservedly won him loads of fans from generation to generation. Bowie has changed his style from album to album and has produced music in loads of different styles whilst still maintaining his distinctive sound. 'Hunky Dory', Bowie's fourth studio album, released in 1971 is one of the greatest chapters in his career and is definitely one of his most powerful releases.<br /><br />'Hunky Dory' is the second album in what I would describe as Bowie's classic run of five albums from 'Man Who Sold the World' to 'Diamond Dogs' when he was at his very best. 'Hunky Dory' though is one of his most unique releases. Bowie was not yet into his famous Ziggy Stardust glam rock period but neither is this album as strongly guitar based as its predecessor 'Man Who Sold the World'. 'Hunky Dory' instead is much more acoustic based with lots of piano thrown in but most of all is an album of unbelievable songwriting - songs don't come much better than those on this album. The album is really well structured as well - each side of the original LP has happy/upbeat songs for the most part but finishes off with a darker, emotive and more powerful song ('Quicksand' and 'Bewlay Brothers'). Bowie's backing group are also excellent on this album. Rick Wakeman's jazzy piano playing is there practically throughout and really characterises the album. Mick Ronson plays some great guitar solos on the album especially in 'Life on Mars'. Bowie's accomplished and often overlooked saxophone playing is also top notch on this album.<br /><br />David Bowie's album collection has undergone a number of remasters since CD's became commonplace about 20 years ago. Recently an enhanced CD version of 'Hunky Dory' was released. Obviously the sound quality is great but the version lacks any bonus tracks, which incidentally can be found on the 1991 remaster. The latter is the version I would recommend. It still has excellent sound quality and also has demo versions of 'Quicksand' and 'Bewlay Brothers' as well as an album outtake 'Bombers' and an alternative version of 'The Supermen' from 'The Man Who Sold the World' album.<br /><br />Eventhough this masterpiece yielded a fair-share of singles, this album is not pop in my opinion but instead is a great serving of alternative, extremely listenable music. 'Changes', one of Bowie's well known songs starts the album. An excellent song, its got a classic chorus with loads of piano play. 'oh You Pretty Things' is a great follow up - brilliant for a sing along with another catchy chorus. It runs very cleverly into 'Eight Line Poem' which is a more reflective songs with somem rather bluesy guitar playing from Mick Ronson. 'Life On Mars?' is next up and this one truly one of Bowie's great songs. The lyrics are some of the best I've heard and Mick Ronson's closing solo is out of this world - listen out for the phone ringing at the end of the track! 'Kooks' is an upbeat acoustic track which Bowie wrote for his son, Zowy Bowie. Then we come to 'Quicksand', in my opinion the best track on the album. Its got an amazingly calming start before building into a powerful, heartfelt song - the chorus is really moving. A song about losing direction in life, this is one of Bowie's greatest songs.<br /><br />What was side two of the LP kicks off with a happy sing along 'Fill Your Heart', a great track, although it is the weakest track on this great album - ironically Bowie didn't write this one! 'Andy Warhol' follows this; this strong acoustic jam is excellent. The goofing around in the studio at the start is a hillarious, where Bowie keeps correcting the sound engineer's pronunciation of 'Warhol'. 'Song For Bob Dylan' is a tribute to one of Bowie's great influences and is followed by 'Queen Bitch', the most rocking track on thealbum, Ronson's guitar work on this track is first rate. 'The Bewlay Brothers' is an unbelievably potent finish to the album. I'm amazed how many reviewers of this album overlook the greatness of this track. I've never heard a track like it. It's mostly acoustic based and is Bowie's telling story of his own brother's lifelong mental troubles. The warped sounding voice at the end of the album is really freaky and it makes your blood run cold but its a remarkable finish to an amazing album.<br /><br />The 'Hunky Dory' album captures David Bowie on one of the high points of his career. I'm not sure if I'd call it his best album but its up there with his finest efforts and this album is sure to stand the test of time. I'd recommend this album to anyone who likes a unique alternative style of music or to any fan of David Bowie, although there isn't such such a thing as a Bowie fan who doesn't own this masterpiece!ck is first rate.

B00029LNHS|3.0|This cd is all about the sounds........a lot of the songs are good altho some of the words are questionable...for example if you like their song Lets get it started---u will be disapointed to hear the original on their cd which is LETS GET RETARDED........if your not a fan of sound with lyrics that are ok then dont buy the cd......if you love to party, get up and dance, and just have fun to music then this is a great cd for you....
B00097A5I6|4.0|By setting the bars extremely high with 'What's The Story, Morning Glory?', Oasis definitely has to do a lot to surpass their greatest creation. Have they done it yet? Not exactly, but they've come pretty darn close. Prior to Morning Glory was 'Definitely Maybe', which was a really good album. 'The Masterplan' was another gem as well. The newest album, 'Don't Believe The Truth', only recently came out (Memorial Day). Did it live up to Morning Glory? <br /> <br /> <br />Of course not, but it was really good. I'll start with the bad parts, first. <br /> <br />THE BAD <br />_____________ <br />A certain number of the songs are written in a minor key, as if the band is under a lot of pressure and are MAD about it. For example, the song \\"Turn up the Sun\\" written by bassist Andy Bell states: <br />\\"I carry madness...everywhere I go\\" <br />...isn't exactly a happy tune. I guess that all of their songs can't be happy, though. <br /> <br />THE GOOD <br />____________ <br /> <br />The album is reminiscent of bands such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones (\\"Mucky Fingers\\", for example) Plus, the first single, \\"Lyla\\", is a great foot-tapping tune that is a style of its own. Another dancing track on the album is \\"The Meaning of Soul\\", which is a song that you just would like to hop around the house to. A song mentioned before, \\"Mucky Fingers\\", is also a good song. I'm not quite sure who sings that song, but I'm definitely sure it's not Liam. <br /> <br />OVERALL <br />_________ <br /> <br />It's a kind of short review for me, but I'd say that overall Oasis' new album is a must buy. I thought that it was progressive, with minor (a bit too much of it) and major songs. I'd reccomend it to all Beatles (and Oasis, of course) lovers.
B0006399FS|1.0|Embarrassing. This album for me actually earned the dubious distinction of being worse than ATYCLB, which was a distinction not easily earned. <br /> <br />Listen to Achtung Baby or Pop, then listen to this, and you too will feel the pain of disappointment. <br /> <br />U2 play it safe once again, and that's almost completely unrecognizable as one of the most innovative bands in the 90s.  <br /> <br />The whole albums sounds too mechanized. this is simply a weak carbon-copy of ATYCLB that doesn't manage to notch any major hits and ends up sounding completely unexciting and overly commercial. <br /> <br />If you are a casual U2 fan and if you have a brain and you don't run to the nearest music store trying to get every new s*** promoted on MTV or Rolling Stone as \\"masterpiece\\" you will find this an insulting piece of unmemorable iPod crap.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00009W0U4|1.0|Having endured the inanities surrounding the simple plot of this movie, I do ask myself what difference viewing it has made to me. The answer is none.  There is no need to view a rape scene to be led to condemn this despicable act.  It always has been despicable.  There is no need to be introduced to the slimy world of sex clubs, homosexual or otherwise.  An unpolluted mind will do fine, thanks anyway.  I'm glad this shaky hand-held camera circus is fast receding from my mind, possibly helped by the (fortunately) ample shades of darkness inflicting most of the flick, which must have saved saved the director from making much sense. <br />I would advise potential viewers to beware of the movie industry's self-congratulatory movie reviews.  Who wouldn't do likewise?  I can only say, \\"pull the other one!\\"
B000024D4R|5.0|This is the most perectly written, designed, and executed album that humanity has yet to produce. <br /> <br />Yes let me explain.  I listened to it once, than again, and again, each time hearing new harmonies and motifs, both subconcious and superconcious effects.  I feel as if there is a universe in this album, it is so intriguing, almost Mandlebrot-like in its complexity. <br /> <br />The bridge in \\"Dogs\\", three guitar chords, quite simply, is the greatest moment in musical history since Bach's 2nd cello suite.  Those chords and indeed the combinations of notes found in the entire album, they are both terrifying and glorious in their uniqueness. <br /> <br />This is Floyd's best, this is music's best.
140004281X|5.0|This is the first book by Munro I've read, and now I can see what all the fuss is about.  Each story in this collection is a little gem.  Munro is a master of the short story form.  Her plot lines are simple yet unpredictable and gripping; her characters come alive with a few short stokes.  What makes her writing so life-like is that you don't know everything about her characters.  What you learn about them is revealed in a few slices of time or short vignettes.  As in life, you don't always understand what motivates Munro's characters to do what they do.  Munro shows you their actions and describes some of the thoughts they have, but she allows you form your own conclusions.  She never \\"forces\\" anything, which is why her stories seem so naturalistic.<br /><br />Some of these stories are terribly sad, particularly the three stories about a woman named Juliet who runs away from her humdrum life as an academic.  It starts out optimistically enough - a train ride which seems to offer unlimited possibilities for her to re-invent herself.  But the last of these three stories \\"Silence\\", is one of the saddest and most memorable short stories I've ever read.  In it, Juliet experiences what it means to \\"run away\\" from the perspective of the person left behind.<br /><br />Munro is a master of the telling detail.  She is also a master of the unexpected and yet strangely life-like plot twist.  Many of the plots turn on seeming chance happenstance. In this collection she seems almost obsessed with the role chance and caprice play in life.<br /><br />These stories are all highly readable.  Some of them build up a degree of suspense more typical of detective stories.  The language is simple and spare. Even so, Munro is capable of unobtrusively adding highly sophisticated touches - for example, a character that makes an annual pilgrimage to see a Shakespeare play has her own story crucially influenced by a \\"Shakespearean\\" plot device.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys fine writing and beautifully crafted stories, and who isn't looking for happy endings or unambiguous explanations.ection to anyone who enjoys fine writing and beautifully crafted stories, and who isn't looking for happy endings or unambiguous explanations.

B0009KA7BS|1.0|Very bad Keanu Reeves clunker that is hands down his worse movie to date. Keanu literally stinks in this film with a performance that is destine to be the pinnacle of his bad acting career and the screenplay is a joke in so many ways that it has to be seen to believe. The only actor in this mess who stands her ground is Rachel Weisz and she does give way too much class and talent to this movie with a performance that is way too good for it. The praise she is getting is well deserved but other than her sadly, the rest of the cast is pretty bad and they don't even try to give good performances with the roles they have, and some of them even look like they don't even want to be there. The direction by first time director Frances Lawrence is incoherent and some part of the film make no sense what so ever and the special effects are poorly done for a movie of this size.  <br /> <br /> <br />I dare anyone to try to keep a strait face while watching this movie because it's so bad that you will laugh your butt off.    <br />
B00005M91K|5.0|This is maybe one of my best DVDs in the entire collection. I love the images for their beauty. I love the images for their message about \\"civilasation\\" and \\"globalization\\". It has a nice music to run in the backround - i really do recommend this over the kyoqanaixtigrkl-series, which i also bought but really never watch. <br />This DVD, i do watch quite often. The DVD could use some more extras though. Or maybe a documentation on what all those scenes mean, what is happpening in those foreign cultures.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|One of the 5 best horror films I've seen, \\"Saw\\" ranks with such classics as \\"The Exorcist,\\" \\"Jaws,\\" and \\"Alien.\\" Director Wan plunges the audience in \\"medias res,\\" dispensing with amenities or unnecessary introductions to present Whannel's story in a way that is reminiscent of Poe's best horror tales. The technique ensures that the viewer is always part of the action by setting up a tension that continues seamlessly to the final scene. Whannel demonstrates his writing expertise by offering his viewers a story line that carries them on an emotive experience to keep them vacillating between fear and hope.<br /><br />Whannel's writing always maintains the mystery of his plot. His method of guarding his mystery is not obscurantism or over-complication. Instead, he provides an interactive dialog between character and audience that forces the audience to participate in trying to make sense of the central dilemma. Wan supports the story through flashbacks and artful cinematography, making revelations that give the audience hope that they are on the verge of solving this entangled mystery. And at each turn of the plot, Wan jolts the audience back to the fear that the mystery might never be revealed. The soundtrack is unobtrusive, yet it functions as an unconscious energy that keeps the viewer focused.<br /><br />Whannel's choice of the name Adam for his own role evokes the \\"loss of innocence\\" myth from the first Book of the bible, \\"Genesis.\\" And his choice of the name John for the role played by Tobin Bell, evokes the myth from the last Book of the bible, \\"Revelations.\\" Together these two classic myths hint at Whannel's philosophical message about life-and the true meaning of horror.<br /><br />The only minor criticism I can offer is that I would prefer to have seen the role of Dr. Gordon played by an older, darker, and more seasoned actor like Dan Hedaya. But the collaboration of Wan and Whannel produced a 21st century horror classic that offers excellent writing, directing, cinematography, editing, and acting. It is a \\"must experience.\\"directing, cinematography, editing, and acting. It is a \\"must experience.\\"  <br />
B00097A5I6|5.0|Had this less than a week, and rather missed the Gallagher boys.  Almost forgot anything came out of Manchester not related to a disappointing third place football club in the EPL since the Roses called it a day ten years ago.  This restored my faith in the city that brought us everything from Peter Noone to New Order.  This is their most consistently decent album since their first, meaning that I've listened to it repeatedly.  The last one of theirs I did that to was the live CD and studiowise, Masterplan.  Yep, after two misstep studio albums, Liam and Noel have rediscovered the proper mix of Gary Glitter, Slade, the Beatles (Aye, having Ring's kid playing drums don't hurt by half either) and the Stones, slamming it into the back of the net like United haven't been able to since that overrated egomaniac Beckham bolted for Real Madrid.<br /><br />Cheers, boys, we wish you success.  It's good to have the both of ya back.<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />epsteinsmutha
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Other reviews have been so detailed that I can add nothing other than the fact that this movie IS fabulous.<br /><br />My main fear was that watching the movie would ruin my memory of seeing it on Broadway in NYC (one of the highlights of my life!)  Instead I am now kicking myself for not having seen it in the theatre.<br /><br />Michael Crawford has an amazing voice as the Phantom on Broadway but the actor who performs it in the movie does a great job (although NO competition for Michael Crawford who is amazing) STILL it is very good....<br /><br />This is NOT a normal movie though with talking. That is what I expected. It is the next best thing to seeing it on Broadway. Outstanding. I've already seen it 3 times and my daughters love it too. FABULOUS!
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Stupid and very incoherent adaptation of the Hellblazer comic lacks that book's sense of humor and complexity and goes for the gusto in stupidity with a very bad performance by Keanu Reeves, who manages to make his last two matrix films look like masterpieces compared to his work here. He not only sucks the life out of every scene he's in but manages to bring the film down to his level of acting in certain scenes. Director Frances Lawrence tries hard but lacks focus in certain scenes and lacks a sense of continually with his work. He steals from the best but lacks the substance to pull it off. The only redeeming things this movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a strong, complex and moving performance despite the fact that the movie is not worthy of it. I would have liked to have learn more about her character and her relationship with her sister, which would have been a much better movie than this film was if they just could have based the film around her character instead of John Constantine. Djmon Hounsou, who was so great in the film \\" In America\\" only has a bit part here and he does well with it but I would have rather had him play a much bigger role than he was allowed to play in this film. Peter Stormare, who was so great in the movies \\"Birth\\" and \\"Chocolat\\", gives quite an unusual take of the devil. Unfortunately, he's not in the movie very much at all. The special effects are good but the way hell is represented here is more a variation of the sets that was used in the film than something completely original. It's a decent film if you're in the mood for this kind of movie but I you will end up thinking that it could have been better once it's over.
B00006IR5S|5.0|John Williams couldn't have done a better job of building off the Scorcerer's Stone to create one of my favorite soundtracks.  The melodies he creates for certain characters in the story are not only perfect, but beautiful.  Fawkes the Phoenix is, perhaps, one of the most captivating and glorious pieces...while Gilderoy Lockhart sincerely seems to sound like Lockhart would if he were a song!  The soundtrack is packed with beautiful, memorable melodies and will leave you completely satisfied.  Purchase this soundtrack with confidence...it's magnificent!
0345308239|5.0|Barbara Tuchman had great insight in writing this book. She may have really had Vietnam in mind from the beginning, and gone back and selected her examples in order to make the final and for her purpose, major chapter of folly,more convincing- but she hit upon something so true that it almost cries out to heaven at not being mentioned more often. Governments do very often act in total contradiction to their own best interest, and to the best interest of the people they are meant to serve.<br />Tuchman writes of ancient Troy, and the Papal See during the Renaissance, of the British Monarchy in its folly in relation to the Colonies during the American Revolutionary War. She also writes of Vietnam, a chapter I prefer not to comment on, because even after all the years I am still divided on the subject- i.e.<br />What has been in my mind is other instances of governments acting against themselves such as the Israeli Government's folly in bringing its worst enemy into its territory, arming it, and then making it responsible for keeping the peace. The ' terror' that came afterwards and is with us today is a result of that Oslo folly. And now a different Israeli government is thinking of another act of stupidity, a one- sided withdrawal which will give still more power and proximity to its enemies.<br />Tuchman in the studies she does here, uses certain criteria. The folly must be a present policy of a government, that people in that time do understand as folly. There must be alternatives to it. And the folly must be the action not of one eccentric individual but of a government of a counsel of men.<br />One question that might be asked is: Given the fact that human beings have freedom, and power of decision it would seem 'folly' or 'mistaken self- defeating policy' is an inherent option in Governmental policy.<br />It would be interesting to have studies which try to show ' wise government decisions' , studies too which try to see the factors which make for ' wise policy' and those which tend to lead to 'folly'.<br />In the one case I know best that not included in this book, the folly involved in Israel's arming and ceding territory to its enemies it seems to me that there are many factors involved: One central one however is the longing for peace, the tiredness of war on the part of the Israeli people. There is no good option, no real chance for peace, so the Government instead of taking the hard, best option chooses something which seems to give an immediate reward but in fact turns out to be a nightmare.<br />In this the 'opposite of folly' is a kind of courageous confrontation of reality, a kind of strength in will despite promise of further adversity.<br />Let us pray that the democratic countries of the world will have the strength not to be too foolish again. ( At present US folly is in my opinion displayed in its unconditional support of Saudi Arabia as Saudi Arabia sends terrorists into Iraq, funds the worldwide terror network, runs the world's slavetrade, teaches fierce anti- Americanism in its schools, exports this kind of Wahhabism throughout the world, including in thirteen- hundred mosques within the United States.<br />If the enemy is at the gate, there is no reason to open it wide and let him in.tend to lead to 'folly'.

B00000J7RZ|1.0|This is a painful reminder, not mention an insult, of how the talentless and undeserving will get ahead just because of good looks.  That is all J.Lo and people like her are, nothing but very attractive and good-looking chicks that don't have to do anything to succeed just because of a pretty face.  When I first heard that this chick was going into the music industry, I just had to laugh to myself and such disgust and conceit that soneone can have.  J.Lo is neither a \\"singer\\" or a writer, and is far from deserving of the title, \\"artist\\".  It makes me sick that she has been so successful all because of her pretty looks, not mention the all so obvious heavy commercialism and sensationalism of her personal life like all those failed marriages, so-called \\"duets\\" with Ja Rule, Marc Anthony, and any other fool to stupid to see through her charades that she is just desperate to get a name by imploying the hot artists of \\"that time\\".  THe only good song is \\"waiting for tonight\\" and that's only because of the spicy and tight sounding beats. J.Lo and her fellow paraders like britney spears are true insults to those musicians that can truly sing and write. <br /> <br />P.S.: And go ahead and call me jealous and hating all you want.  The truth is the truth.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|I taped the Melbourne concert and have watched it several times. What a great show. Liked the 2 new songs. I've already ordered the DVD. I'm hoping they do like they did with Hell Freezes Over and release this one on CD too.
B0000639FE|5.0|Another one of the best movies of the 90's and of all-time!<br /><br />Tom Cruise in the title role gives the most memorable performance since A Few Good Men.  Cuba Gooding Jr. was just as memorable as Jerry's client, Rod Tidwell.  He was hilarious as he yelled, \\"SHOW ME THE MONEY!\\"  And he was shown the Oscar as he won it for Best Supporting Actor.<br /><br />Among the other great scenes in the movie, Tidwell tried his luck as the wedding singer singing Marvin Gaye's classic, \\"What's Going On\\" at their wedding.  Funny and maybe a little appropriate since Gooding Jr's father, Cuba Gooding Sr. was the lead singer of the '70's soul group The Main Ingredient (Everybody Plays The Fool & Just Don't Want To Be Lonely).<br /><br />Renne Zellweger, Regina King, Kelly Preston and Jonathon Lipnicki also provide great performances in, what is without question, a film classic!<br /><br />So be sure you let Amazon.com SHOW YOU THIS DVD!
B00004T8RK|4.0|I bought this record the day it came out.  I had been looking forward to its release for weeks and drove straight home from the store with it, popped it in, cranked the stereo and had a seat in my living room. <br /> <br />After the first 4 songs or so I found myself surprisingly unenthused.  What the heck?  These songs suck! I said to myself as I ate nachos on my couch.  However things picked up as it went on, and by the end I was pleased with it. I've since listened to it many a time and have chenged my tune about some of the tunes... <br /> <br />Here's the deal:  Breakerfall, Light years, Of A Girl, Insignificance, Rival, Parting ways, Slight of Hand, these are all EXCELLENT songs that stay in my head for days when I hear them.  There are some terrific, abstract but intimate lyrics in these tunes and some wonderful musicianship.  It also sounds terrific, organic, analog, mushy goodness.  Its not the flashy hyper-compressed production that Ten was. <br /> <br />Some songs aren't so hot, God's Dice is a poor effort as is Evacuation IMO.  I also find myself pretty unmoved by Nothing as It Seems, though many people seem to like it a good bit. <br /> <br />Finally we come to Grievance.  This song was nominated for a Grammy that year and with good reason.  IT IS SPECTACULAR.  Though I'm not a huge fan of Matt Cameron's drumming, he is capable of some stunning time changes and this song makes tremendous use of that.  Vedder writes some of the best protest song lyrics anyone has done in recent years here, much better than any of the infantile stuff on Riot Act and the guitars are simply brutal.  This is a truly memorable song and well worth the price of admission alone.

6303522440|4.0|Fellini could do little wrong after \\"8½\\". I saw just about everything he put out between that and \\"Ginger & Fred\\", inclusive. Missed \\"City of Women\\" for some reason, but DID see \\"Satyricon\\", \\"The Clowns\\", \\"Amarcord\\" \\"..And The Ship Sails On\\" and \\"G&F\\".<br /><br />The man was a master...he repeated himself often...for instance, he broke the fourth wall a LOT, and would also smash the illusion of the movie itself, by revealing his crew and soundstage, as in \\"..Sails On\\" and \\"Satyricon\\" and a LOT of his work was autobiographical, but he was STILL a master!<br /><br />He, along with David Lynch, was the master of the dream-like movie...ALL his movies had it, but \\"Juliette and the Spirits\\", \\"Satyricon\\", \\"Sails On\\" and \\"Ginger & Fred\\", were shining examples of the style. Even \\"Amarcord\\" and \\"The Clowns\\" had an ethereal quality to them as well.<br /><br />Fellini's affection for his Italy and his characters is readily apparent in everything he's directed, be it the waif in \\"La Strada\\", played by his wife, Giulia Messiina, or \\"Volpina\\" in \\"Amarcord\\", it's more than obvious that he at one time actually knew people like this, for his scrripts are much too detailed and involved to be casual stories taken off the top of his head. \\"Amarcord\\" makes this quite obvious with the adventures of a family that includes an uncle and a grandfather all living with a core family under one roof. The detail of behavior and conversation could only mean that it's some form of a roman a clef.<br /><br />\\"Amarcord\\" is the observation of life in a small town in Italy circa 1930-35, during the reign of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. It shows teenage boys being mischievious as only teenage boys can be, the vain and woebegone ladies of the town, the working men and oddball teachers of the local school. It observes it all with affection and an eye for comedy that is uniquely Italian.<br /><br />This was perhaps Fellini's most popular film, probably because so much of it rings familiar with American audiences, (the scene in the math class being a case in point!) In fact, more American directors would do well to emulate Fellini when it comes to expositions of small towns, for he was truly the king of collective biography!<br /><br />As well as dreams.r with American audiences, (the scene in the math class being a case in point!)

But they must enter the tornado's dealy path to do it.  Great special effects and a great story line make Twister a must-have for your DVD collection!  You will love it!
B00005V3Z4|4.0|When I first rented this film, as with some I have never heard of, I chose it based on the synopsis on the back.  What I saw was a mix of horror, comedy, drama, and science fiction.  I had to watch it a few times, not just to fully understand what the movie's message was, but because it was just that good.  If you're in the mood for an entertaining film that causes you to think without being pretentious, pick this one up.
0449002632|5.0|This is a truly brilliant book.  Even though it took me a couple of months to read, I felt entirely satisfied by the end.  The research Rutherfurd put into this vast work is mind-boggling.<br />However....<br />Because of the nature of the book, by about halfway through, the characters from each generation of each particular family started to blend together for me and become the same person, so to speak.  True, the family tree chart at the beginning helps, but to look at that at the beginning of each chapter gives away which characters will marry and which ones will live long enough to produce children and continue the family line!  Sort of takes away from some of the suspense.<br />The only other bone I have to pick with the author is this:  what does he have against overweight women?  In various chapters throughout the book, almost like a recurring motif, there appears a &quot;fat girl&quot; or a &quot;fat woman.&quot;  All but one of these women are presented to the reader WITHOUT A NAME and shown to be greedy (constantly eating), stupid, lazy, selfish -- AND WITHOUT ANYTHING TO SAY AT ALL.  I can't understand Rutherfurd's purpose in doing this.  I found it insulting -- and I'm a man of normal weight.  I can only imagine what female readers felt about the presentation of these characters!
B00004YA66|5.0|I enjoy watching this film anytime. I first bought it on VHS and, when I found it on DVD, I grabbed it for the extras. This is currently on my top ten list of favorite films of all time! <br /> <br />It is Science Fiction, Action and Drama all rolled into one. Once it starts, you are pulled in and can't take your eyes off until the credits are rolling! <br /> <br />Jim Caviezel plays a man who while experimenting with his late Dad's Ham radio, actually contacts his Dad (Dennis Quaid), 30 years in the past, because of a Northern Lights phenominon. Together, they change history, while taking viewers on an action filled, emotional ride until the amazing ending! You'll not regret the time or money spent on this film.
B00005QCYD|4.0|As in so many cases, a great movie comes out and the sequel is just mediocre. Then a third sequel comes along and it too is a great movie. This is yet another example of that phenomenon.  JURASSIC PARK III is a good movie. I don't think it is a good as the first but it is certainly better than the second and the dinosaur footage might well be considered the best yet. <br /> <br />This is a straight adventure/rescue story. Sam Neil is hoodwinked into returning to the isle of dinosaurs to act as a \\"tour guide\\". He is only supposed to narrate what is seen from a plane that will never land. As it turns out, the plane does land and the purpose of landing is to search for a lost boy. The good doctor was shanghaied because the parents of the boy wanted someone with experience running from large carnivores. By the end of the film, everyone has plenty of experience. <br /> <br />If I had one real complaint about this one it is the suspiciously good timing of the marines who turn up to save the day. That didn't destroy the story, though. By the time that happens, everything is pretty much over. <br /> <br />As with the second in the series, there are plenty of new dinosaurs at which to marvel. These include some that may pave the way for yet a fourth in the series. <br />
B00005RFVL|5.0|Sadly, I've come to the conclusion that I'm one of a handful of Americans who really listens to Robbie Williams.  I think most of America is seriously missing out.  This album, a departure from his usual pop numbers, is among one of my favorites.  The songs on this album are classic swing, big band numbers.  He hasn't messed with them, he's kept them true to their original form.  The album is fun and very entertaining.  Guest \\"stars\\" like Nicole Kidman and Jon Lovitz help Robbie create a truly memorable album.  My two year old daughter is also a huge fan of Robbie's (I wonder where she got that? Oh, and don't worry...I cough over the curse words!) and was so excited to hear his version of \\"Beyond the Sea\\" on this album.  It is also in the ending credits of her favorite movie, Finding Nemo.  She asks reapeatedly for her \\"Nemo song\\", as well as others.  If you are a Robbie Williams fan, or even just a fan of big band music done really well, you really should look into buying this.  Maybe if we can get our fellow Americans to join in, we won't have to pay import prices anymore!!!
B00004WIDR|3.0|The original JURASSIC PARK was rightly hailed as a masterpiece. It was a winner on several fronts including story, performance and, especially, the special effects that created the dinosaurs that starred in the film. Of these criteria, the only one which THE LOST WORLD can lay claim to is that of the special effects. The dinosaurs are just as stunning in the sequel as they were in the original and there is some additional variety as well. That being said, everything else about this one is weaker. <br /> <br />A few years after the original story, a scientific team heads back to the islands to learn what they can. Included among them is Jeff Goldblum's girlfriend. He has no wish to return but does so in order to protect her. Unknown to him, his daughter stows away. Things are exciting and tense enough with that setup but the board of directors of the company that originally financed the venture sends in a large scale team in order to capture some of them and bring them back to a \\"zoo\\". Inevitably, there is conflict between the capitalist exploiters and the environmental types. They put these differences aside, however, when it looks like all of them are on the menu. Things get even more complicated when it looks like all of San Diego is on the menu as well. It is all very reminiscent of KING KONG. <br /> <br />The film is well done and the acting is credible but it is just not as exciting as the first. It is certainly worth viewing, especially if you like dino flics but save it until after you have seen everything else that is high on your list. <br />
2266144340|5.0|Forget about the hype, will the suspension of your disbelief and enjoy this terrific page turner. Without spoiling the plot or the surprises it's about a Symbiologist (Robert Langdon) who is in France to meet the Curator of The Louvre Art Museum. But the meeting never takes place and there follows in the next few hundred pages an incredible eye-opening journey of discovery. He and a Cryptologist (Sophie Neveau) are on a chase to solve a puzzle left for them by The Curator. They don't know who the good guys/bad guys are, they don't know what's at the end of the puzzle and there are twists and turns all the way through. It reminds me of The Thirty-Nine Steps where you have an ordinary guy (okay, not ordinary but a non-cop/non-crook) just minding his own business and then suddenly caught up in international intrigue and murder and having to stay ahead of both the good guys and bad guys because he doesn't know who's on his side. The beginning, ending, and the ride in between are fantastic. The controversial aspects of the book concern Paganism and Catholicism and I'm sure there are many facts but also fallacies- this is fiction, but terrific fiction. It's nearly six hundred pages long and I read it in a weekend.
B0001O3YCG|3.0|This was the second Riddick movie I've seen. I watched it in the hope that the sequel I saw first would make more sense. No such luck. This one does, however, make more sense by itself.<br /><br />The premise is of a crash landing on a forbidding planet. One of those to survive is an escaped convict with a bounty. The trouble is that the local wildlife is not very friendly and seems to take a positive delight in turning survivors into casualties. They appear to be large creatures, somewhat reminiscent of bats, vampire tendencies and an aversion to light and human beings. That is where Riddick comes in handy since he is decidedly unhealthy to the \\"bats\\".<br /><br />The story was fairly predictable but done well enough. I did not think it was great but it apparently appeals to some. Don't expect it to be a great setup for the sequel, though.
B0000AM6IY|4.0|\\"The Jets\\" (A gang of racist American guys...and a wannabe girl member.) and \\"The Sharks\\" (A group of Puerto Rican men who feel as though they are being treated unfairly in their new American home.) are enemies.  Each group feels as though THEY should be the owner of the city streets, and top dogs in the dog pound.  Whenever possible, the two groups taunt, attack, and insult each other, always with the disapproving police officers getting in the way.  But when former Jets member Tony, who is still loyal to the group, falls in love with the lovely Maria, sister of the leader of the Sharks, it looks like there's going to be more trouble, more lost, and more gained than anyone expected. <br /> <br />This was a good movie!  It was romantic, occasionally funny, sometimes sad, sometimes sort of disturbing, and very musical.  My favorite song would have to be the one where the Jets make fun of authority and why they are gangsters.  People got over losses way too fast, but it's not like viewers are going to want to sit and watch hours of tears and moping, either.  Overall, I recommend this movie to tweens, teens, and adults who want a good, romantic movie (From the days when movie romance was genuine, instead of non-stop making out!).  Parents, it is up to you if you want your kids to watch it.  But be warned that there is some violence, and some slightly adult themes in it.
B00004WIDQ|5.0|Imagine an eccentric coming up with a way to resurrect the dinosaurs and then building a theme park around the idea. Imagine further that a couple of scientists get invited to look over the park before it opens. Imagine as a final step that the visitors, along with some kids, are on a tour of the park when a saboteur brings down the security systems and the giant monsters are let loose. The only thing left is the tremendous technical challenges to make all of these imaginings come to pass. Spielberg pulls it all off. <br /> <br />It is a fight for survival when they are caught in the park when the power goes down. The only thing the people have going for them is their intelligence. Unfortunately, some of the dinosaurs are intelligent themselves. They can learn and they are hungry. They are also hacked off at being cooped up. Everyone has to run for it. <br /> <br />The story presented in this film is interesting and fun to watch. Just as interesting and fascinating in its own right is watching these flights of fancy come to life on the screen. The dinosaur footage is worth the price of admission all by itself. It is truly miraculous. The dinosaurs are the real stars of this show. The excellent performances by all the rest of the cast are just the icing on the cake. <br /> <br />This version of the DVD has a \\"Making Of\\" featurette.  This too is worth the admission. <br />
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|If season 1 didnt get you going, season 2 certainly will.  <br /> <br />The first few episodes carry on in great fashion from the finale of the 1st season and the relationshp between summer and seth is incredibly gripping.  <br /> <br />Watching these episodes over and over again you pick up small things that the directors have cleverly inputted, like duplicate lines being used from the 1st season to produce wit to those who notice it.  <br /> <br />Seth's (adam brody) humour is hilarious and seth's mission to go 'stealth' one night had me in tears. <br /> <br />This season though, is all about its ending. The final episode hits you hard and all of the previous episodes gel together once you watch ep 24. Things that shouldnt happen do, and the kitchen scene with kirsten, seth, sandy, hayley and ryan will make you feel weak at the knees. <br /> <br />As for the final scene, for a supposed 'teenie flick ' it becomes more of a high class drama movie and the acting of all the characters shows us what a great programme The O.C has become. <br /> <br />I am a big big fan, and if you give it a chance, behold the addiction. Enjoy.
B00097A5I6|4.0|Oasis has returned, and added a little more originality to that tried and true formula: when in doubt, ask yourself: What would Lennon do? DON'T BELIEVE THE TRUTH is definitely (maybe ... hehe) the softest of their records, with a lot more acoustic than in previous efforts. The sound has changed, and sometimes not for the better. Many of the beats to these songs sound like the drummer is just hammering away with an acoustic guitar strumming in time. Even the excellent \\"Lyla\\" is obviously lacking in this department. The rythm section on DON'T BELIEVE THE TRUTH should be improved upon next time. The highlights are \\"Lyla,\\" \\"Love Like A Bomb,\\" \\"Keep the Dream Alive,\\" \\"A Bell Will Ring\\" and the best track, \\"Let There Be Love.\\" Another problem is Noel. \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\" and \\"Little By Little\\" are incredible tracks, but \\"Part of the Que\\" and \\"Mucky Fingers\\" are badly recorded, badly sung and the pretty good instrumental pieces on both are not enough to cover it.  <br /> <br />\\"Lyla\\" is the first single, and therefore very catchy and sticks in your head for ages. The lyrics are strong, Noel's guitar solo is excellent, and flows from the second chorus like a stream from a mountain spring, instead of *springing* out of nowhere as he sometimes does. The chorus itself is one of the high points. \\"Keep the Dream Alive\\" is also an excellent song, as good as \\"Lyla.\\" It's an anthem of hope, instead of the usual barrel of angst that you expect of an Oasis record's best song. Second-best, actually. \\"Let There Be Love\\" is one of the best written Oasis songs, and simply brilliant. Well-written, well-sung, and everything just clicks in a best-for-last track that delivers. \\"A Bell Will Ring\\" is vintage Oasis, and you don't find much of that on this record. <br /> <br />The middling songs are good, but unremarkable. \\"Turn Up the Sun\\" lays heavy emphasis on the instruments, even though it's largely acoustic and the long intro is nothing but a dull repetition of a drumbeat and a fewacoustic chords. \\"Mucky Fingers\\" is the weakest song on the album, and anything that might have redeemed it a little is killed off by the dull percussion section. \\"Love Like A Bomb\\" is slow and soft, but very catchy and another one that you'll hum for days on end. \\"Part of the Queue\\" is pretty much a small (very small) improvement on \\"Mucky Fingers.\\" \\"The Importance of Being Idle,\\" \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel\\" and \\"The Meaning of Soul\\" are good songs, especially \\"The Meaning of Soul,\\" but three of the best songs on the record follow these three, and that makes them seem like filler. A pity. DON'T BELIEVE THE TRUTH finishes off with a good instrumental, \\"I Can See It Now.\\" <br /> <br />As good as the album is, it's flawed, but every record is flawed in some way. DON'T BELIEVE THE TRUTH just doesn't have the raw power of previous Oasis songs, or the sincerity, besides a few notable exceptions mentioned above. After listening it through, a couple of times, it got me back into Oasis mood, and I listened to the greats of the '90s, \\"Morning Glory,\\" \\"Acquiesce,\\" \\"Champagne Supernova,\\" \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out,\\" \\"Don't Look Back In Anger,\\" \\"Little By Little,\\" \\"Live Forever,\\" \\"Supersonic,\\" \\"Some Might Say,\\" \\"Stand By Me,\\" the list just KEEPS GOING. And you know, those songs are all MAGICAL. Oasis won't be as good as the glory days, when they were the biggest, the baddest, and most importantly, the best. Still, keep the dream alive, brothers Gallagher.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I had heard all the hype for this movie from family and friends, so  I recently bought the DVD.  I watched it with my wife, who is pretty enlightened.  I was laughing out loud throughout most of the movie, but she was only chuckling at times.  The bedroom scene was absolutely hilarious, but I can see how it wouldn't appeal to everyone.  The South Park boys did a great job with this movie, and poke fun at everyone.  Guys, this DVD is definately worth buying - girls, you may want to pass.
0684800713|1.0|I picked up an old copy of this Hemingway book at an antique mall for $4 or so, and was excited to read my first Hemingway novel. I'm a huge fan of classic literature and have read many books by Steinbeck, Dickens, and Bronte. I read half of this one and then one night threw it across the room, my patience at an end. Here's the first half of the book: \\"We had dinner and a few drinks. We went to a cafe and talked and had some drinks. We ate dinner and had a few drinks. Dinner. Drinks. More dinner. More drinks. We took a cab here (or there) in Paris and had some drinks, and maybe we danced and flirted and talked sh*t about somebody. More dinner. More drinks. I love you, I hate you, maybe you should come up to my room, no you can't.\\" What absolute boring nonesense. I can only pray for those who've stuck it out to the end that something meaningful happens. I flipped through the second half of the book a day or two later and saw the words \\"dinner\\" and \\"drinks\\" on nearly every page and figured it wasn't worth the risk. I really wanted to get into Hemingway, too, so much so that I suffered all the way through the first half before giving up. Perhaps I quit too soon, but there was nothing in the entire first half that made me want to continue reading. Nothing at all.
B0001I55SS|4.0|Good points: <br />Pretty good transfer, lush matte paintings and pretty good miniture work for its time. Incredible soundtrack by Oscar winner John Barry. Some good actors doing a fine job of making space believable. <br /> <br />Weak points: <br />Some dialog that hints at some non-sensical plot twists (i.e. Dr. Reinhardt being afraid of Maximillian). <br /> <br />Cute robots who do nothing but quote proverbs. <br /> <br />Yes, I know, the ending makes NO sense but had I been the writer I wouldnt have known how to end it. <br /> <br />Science that doesnt make sense when your ship is being ripped apart in space....but hey....Kids dont care. <br /> <br />Bad points: <br />The dvd only has ONE documentary presented by one of the SFX crew. Yes, its interesting from a technical side..but..ONE documentary? How hard is it to call up an old actor and get a 5 minute inteview? Sadly Disney is well known for releasing old material with ZERO extras. I guess we should feel lucky that Disney even gave us this much...
B000683VI4|4.0|I usually write long reviews.  This one is going to be brief because I don't see the need to duplicate what many other reviewers already said about this wonderful film.  I absolutely loved it.  My only problem was with the deleted scenes.  After I watched  the movie, I thought I would give it to my 12 1/2 year old daughter to watch, because it looked like something she would like.  It's rated PG-13, and she's almost thirteen, so I thought, \\"no problem.\\"  Then I saw the deleted scenes.  Don't get me wrong.  They were very interesting, and I'm glad to have been able to see them.  But a couple of them would clearly have gotten an \\"R\\" rating, and the commentary over them said just that.  So, I would have preferred that they be given their own separate disc that I could remove before I handed my daughter the movie.   It's a shame that I won't be able to let her watch \\"The Notebook.\\"  She always watches deleted scenes on dvds, and since there are R rated scenes on this PG13 rated disc, she's going to have to miss it.
B000001FK3|5.0|Listen to the music and you can *HEAR* the essense of  a musician who eschewed the crassness of marketing his work.  Marketing stars is shrill-- Cale's music is anything but.    Join us -- experience the ease and joy of discovering such  thoughtful sounds long ago buried by all the hype   for high-profile music which is essentially pushy/shrill.  Non-shrill and \\"laid back\\" does NOT mean 'without content.'  Cale's music is different -- you get drawn into the  music rather than having it pushed in your face.   Experience the feeling of being drawn into the soft textures of Cale's \\"After Midnight\\"   vs the force coming at you from the tempo in Clapton's \\"After Midnight.\\"
B00005V0X5|5.0|This is by far one of the greatest debuts for a band in history.  As production holds it back, the album is still pure thrash.  Any Megadeth fan or any fan of metal would like this.  The highlight of this album would be 'Mechanix'.  This is the first song they 'released'.  But could you believe its not on the Greatest Hits? That sucks and blows and everything else but i'm not getting into that. lol.  It has just so many metal sounds and you can tell from some metal today that this album influenced most of it.  The songs are great and no sense in going through all of them.  The ONLY drawback to this album is the beeped out 'These Boots'.  I haven't received the original yet, but its on the way.  To hold me over, I just burnt a copy of this remastered version and added a downloaded unedited version 'these boots' to it.  Hey, thats using your head.
B00005ATQF|5.0|Unfortunately for Kubrick this film was released in a time when all Vietnam war films were measured against Apocalypse Now. He entered a market that was already glutted. When I first saw it I was disappointed actually. Then I have reseen it, and reseen it, and reseen it. When most other Vietnam war films have dated this one still has freshness and strength. Kunrick manages, as usual, to capture the dreamlike surreal character of the training of the recruits and the war itself, without ever losing the documentary feel of the film. Only a true genius can do that. Private Joker is not really the hero of the film, he is the observer we follow. He tries to observe the war from a distance, through his camera, never really participating, keeping an intellectual distance. It is not until he fires the final fatal shot he truly understands what is going on. Only by becoming a beast does he have any hope of surviving. <br />Another tribute is that everyone can watch it; anti-war protesters and marine veterans alike. <br />There is only one true battle sequence, and that is a kind of inverted siege, instead of the protagonists being botteld up in a house (a safe palce, a Freudian womb) by forces of chaos outside, which is the usual Hollywood fare, the marines need to get into the old factory and get the sniper before they are all picked off. An interesting role reversal, and food for thought.  <br />This film is heavy on symbolism and subtle messages. But they are all timeless, dealing with the nature of war and of humanity, and therefore the film does not age.
B00097A5I6|4.0|Oasis have worked dilligently in the studio the last 18 months trying to come up with a different sound to what was becoming a pretty stale sound. The result is a varied mixed bag of compositions culled from each member of the band. Certainly the addition of bassist Andy Bell and guitarist Gem Archer has added a much needed factor to the equation. Andy has brought a more introspective element and Gem has created a more relaxed and cohesive work environment and is a great backdrop for Liam and Noel to bounce ideas off of. The atmosphere is healthy and the album is product of this metamorphisis.  <br />There is a more versatile Oasis at work here, more at ease and with less pressure to produce the anthemic 90's work they released so often in that era. Oasis are slated for a rebirth. Older wiser and more confident (did i just say that?)Dont Believe The Truth is bound to bring aboard more converts and keep current Oasis fans magnetized (like yours truly). Sometimes bands must endure the valleys to appreciate what it was like to visit the peaks. Oasis know why they are playing and have once again found their muse.
0066620996|4.0|Good to Great identifies what it takes for a company to achieve greatness. Although it sounds vaguely defined, Jim Collins and his team use strict criteria to identify 11 companies that made the transition to great, and stood there for at least 15 years. This book identifies the concepts that are needed to give a company that edge, instead of just remaining at \\"good\\". The importance of executives in a company and how they affect it when they leave is explained. A good executive can be good in his/her own way, however when they leave, he/she never instilled the values in the company so they can continue to thrive. The concept of having level 5 leaders is a balance that takes these companies to the next level.  <br />Also, having the right people on board in a company is very important. If the company has good ideas and the wrong people on board, that idea will never reach the potential if the right people were there in the first place. I like how Jim Collins points out that technology should be used carefully and correctly in order to accelerate momentum, not create it. The end of the book compares how the results from good to great relate to those in his other book, Built to Last. It has little meaning to someone such as me who has not read Built to Last. However, it points out how the concepts in Good to Great should not just be used for established good companies. He sums it up by saying that a starting or early company should use the tools of Good to Great first, become an established great company, and then use the concepts of Built to Last to have an enduring great company. -Rene N. <br />
B0007Y08IS|5.0|After seeing this, you may be somewhat surprised that creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone were able to avoid getting the Salman Rushdie treatment from the forces of international jihad in response to their 90 minutes addressing Islamofacism. The whole thing is a puppetpalooza as the entire film is composed of puppets who are able to do everything that real people do including projectile puking. There's not much of a superficial South Park feel to this film as the plot more closely resembles the old Maxwell Smart vehicle, \\"The Nude Bomb\\" than anything offered weekly on Comedy Central.  The Mission Impossible backdrop goes so far as to even have a even a master computer named \\"I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.\\" and a Mount Rushmore command center for Team America.<br /><br />Yet, the satire will be quite familiar to those who watch South Park and more amazing than anything one can readily imagine.  The war on terror is a great vehicle for these guys to make fun of just about every one on the planet (humanity can be broken down into the simple framework of a--holes, p-ssies, and dicks here).  There are silly songs and killer lines throughout.  Their send up of the play \\"Rent\\" is one early example.  Now it's entitled \\"Lease\\" and the theme song is \\"Everyone has AIDS\\".  We hear such lines as \\"come on everybody we've got quilting to do.\\" More jingles like, \\"America: F--- Yeah!\\", round out the film and it becomes the Team America theme song.<br /><br />Obviously, any story these guys tell is just a surface mechanism for them to ostentatiously display their unworldly wit which is just fine with me. The gratuitious romantic plotline is present; although, the resultant puppet sex is something beyond description and is more like something from a German scat trailer than anything you'd see from Sandra Bullock or Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />Overall, I found Team America/World Police to be masterful. The Screen Actors' Guild is now called the Film Actors Guild which lends itself to the uproarious acronyn of F.A.G.  It is led by the king poseur himself, Alec Baldwin (who, by all rights, should be a Canadain citizen by now).  Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, and Jeanne Garafalo also figure in heavily.  They are all self-righteously opposed to Team America and become the unwitting dupes of the terrorists and the totalitarian dictator of North Korea...much as they have in real life.  F.A.G. is quite similar to the Hollywood organization, \\"Not in Our Name.\\"  Parody becomes dangerously close to reality in this film.<br /><br />My favorite part was the skewering of the fat b-stard, Michael \\"Giant Socialist Weasel\\" Moore.  He turns into a suicide bomber which is something that many of his ideological opponents would have wished upon him years ago.<br /><br />The portrayal of Kim Jong-il is nearly equal to that of Parker and Stone's 1999 efforts with Saddam Hussein. He's a singing, screaming, plotting dictator right out of Austin Powers.  It's great fun and might be the only punch that the world ever lands upon the North Korean menace.  I'm grateful to the makers of Team America and hope that they create a follow up at least half as politically damaging as this one was.e uproarious acronyn of F.A.G.

B000002TPS|5.0|Let me start off by saying 1.09 or whatever it was for used is just wrong.  The album is worth a lot more then that.  I got it brand new and its no longer made in the U.S. so I had to get it imported which caused my price to go up atleast 5 more bucks.  I can tell you now; most Megadeth albums you might have to go to foreign sites to purchase.  Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good!(original) is something i've been looking for over a year now.  I happened to run across a copy here on Amazon and already purchased it so yeh.. only couple videos left and couple remastered cds and i'll have everything Megadeth. <br />Youthanasia is an album from which if you like hard metal, takes a couple of listens to appreciate it.  I wont go track to track because the whole album is good, and probably 50 other people did it.  Its not as heavy as their earlier stuff, but that doesn't mean its not worth the change in your pocket.[I swear man, it might be 1.09 or something but once you add overnight shipping and fast delivery and tax, its the price of a new one] <br />When I first listened to this album I was like, damn it! I wanted another peace sells or holy wars.  You clearly dont get that here.  Maybe its for the better.  I heard somewhere that they change there music to get new fans, but there's more to the story.  You have to consider the fans that are committed to the heavy and when you turn soft.. they leave.  Thats if they're not devoted.  Its a chance that Megadeth took and know Dave knew.  I wouldn't say it backfired, but it sure wasn't a masterpiece album.  I still highly recommend this album to anyone.  Highlights would include the most famous and best on the album A Tout Le Monde, Train Of Consequences, Reckoning Day, Addicted To Chaos, and the song that recalls some of there best songs Victory. <br />
B0000A4GAK|5.0|Like their other cd's there is depth here and sincere solid playing..many styles here, east,blues,cool Jazz,Jamaican as the music moves in a somewhat unique sounding fusion despite the hybrid..these guys cater to unity and it does not hurt qouting The Mysticism Of Sound And Music\\" as they do on the liner notes which fits the groove like the earlier Krishnamurti quote from their Joyful Music cd..these \\"mystics\\" take music sincerely and that is a good thing..The healing that music brings is real and heartfelt...those that missed the 60's and 70's can get a glimpse from a jam band that is professional,respectful and certainly literate.

B0002Y4TOM|2.0|Well, I am a 38 French guy, just for you to know. I had been charmed by season 1. But season 2 gets old pretty fast I think. Overall nothing much happens in season 2. It is mostly a lot of talking to fill out the gaps. The last episode is more exciting to watch but it is no surprise as they just want you to buy season 3 so they make you want more at the end of the last episode. they should have done that with each episode in the season, which they didn't. I was disappointed in not being addicted to it as I had been with THE O.C or ONE TREE HILL.  <br />The other problem I have with this show is the unrealistic way the characters express themselves, you know you can tell someone wrote  every single thing they say. I found it original in season 1 and got tired of it. Buy ONE TREE HILL instead if you haven't done already.
B00080ZG10|1.0|JAMES DEAN as Leo or Leo as James [check 'Giant' - the final scenes and make-up] does not make a movie run .... rather see George Peppard as Howard \\"The Carpetbaggers\\" - a much better and speedier version of the neurotic genius .... the perpetual frown ... thank God for botox .....'an then sum!<br /><br />Bette Davis used to say 'Roll 'em' back on the Warner's lot and Miss Davis said 'Cut\\" when SHE thought appropriate ...{no one dared intefere with la Davis ~ this WAS acting for the lens}.  Unlike this 'applauded' version - pure technique,  However Beckinsale as Ava and the kid as Domerque are worth watching ... the rest?  Whatever happened to those long extended over 10 minute takes/scenes, when the audinece saw real performances, nowadays and especially with this movie - it's just crisp editing.  AND what just was the 'Bergman' \\"Persona\\" pro-and epilogue - the nude teen being washed and dried by mama??<br /><br />Then we had the unrine in the milk-bottle sequence - something perhaps he learned from a female co-star, as well as the brief discussion of Kate's brother's 'suicide' [the 'teen-age' thrill thing - also not quite clarified, the action spoke for itself and was misinterpreted as a suicide in those early days].<br /><br />This one's all noisy Dolby, lots of frowning and male rear views, and FPFX - what happened to good old acting?<br /><br />By the way - Whatever Happened to Terry Moore?????

B00097DX3U|3.0|I, like many people out there, was rather diasppointed in Audioslave's debut upon the first couple listens.  It was just to slow and mellow, no energy, not exciting at all.  But, listening to it again and again it continued to grow on me, and although it's still a bit too slowly paced, and perhaps a bit overlong, it's a great album.  It may be not at all groundbreaking, but virtually all the songs on it fall into the very good to excellent category, which is all it really takes.  With 'Out of Exile' Audioslave pretty much repeat that formula, but it's even more mellowed out this time, virtually devoid of any truly exciting riffwork.  (Though there are still some pretty damn good leads, but, again, not as good as Morello usually makes 'em)  Equally disconcerting, though Cornell's voice still sounds great, the vocal melodies are generally a bit flat.  They sound alright, but nothing here really grabs you the way Cornell can at his best.  So, what we've got here is a talented band pigeonholed into post-grunge, which is just about the dullest rock style around.  And they seem way to damn comfortable here, never rocking with any real conviction and failing to inject all that much emotion into any of the ballads.  Nothing here has the energy and drive of 'Cochise', or the instant memorablility of 'What You Are', or the eerie atmosphere of 'Shadow on the Sun', or the emotion and power of 'Like a Stone' or 'Last Remaining Light'.  That stuff was still fairly conventional, but they've moved even closer to the middle of the road with 'Out of Exile', with the only real new additions to their sound being some happier tunes and some added wussiness.  That's about it, and, frankly, I wasn't looking for either or those things.<br /><br />But, despite the fact that they now use to musical style of the second rate wannabes that were spawned in RATM's and Soundgarden's wake, they still have the talent to rise well above the others.  Cornell may be working at only 60% capacity, but in an absolute sense that's still pretty good.  Same goes with everyone else in the band.  The fact of the matter is, I like every song here, but I don't like any of them very much, and there certainly isn't a single genuinely great song on the album.  Maybe this album will grow on me too, but  I kinda doubt it.  Last time I didn't know what to expect, and was caught of guard.  Not so here.  Anyway, those who enjoyed the first album will probably wanna here this, but this band really needs to kick things up a bit.

Others have done that already. <br />But am I the only one who wonders why they had to make the Box smaller this time? <br />Now it doesn't quite match the other seasons on the shelf. <br />It's also pretty hard to get the inner box into the outer box because it's too tight. <br />And there could have been some more extras. Although \\"All Grown Up\\" was really interesting.
B00000255F|5.0|\\"Born to Run\\" is a timeless album, and definitely one of Bruce's very best! From the message and unforgettable melody of the title track, to revered classics like \\"Thunder Road,\\" this 1975 album is as popular now as it was back when it was first released! On a side note, I find those who review the Boss's political positions rather than his music to be quite annoying! This is a place to review material, and not to critize political beliefs!

B000000WJZ|5.0|This is my favorite CD.  Every song could be a single, yet they combine beautifully to create an experience. <br /> <br />Cherub Rock 10/10 A classic rock song, flows amazingly like all of their songs. <br /> <br />Quiet 9/10 I thought it was too simple at first but now I really like how the vocals mesh with melody. <br /> <br />Today 10/10 One of my first favorite Pumpkins songs, one of the most transcending on the album.  Especially when it explodes into its distortion-laden harmonies. <br /> <br />Hummer 10/10 My favorite song on the album.  Nearly takes my breath away.  It comes out of its scratchy beginning beautifully and carries on. <br /> <br />Rocket 9/10 The guitar effects in this song are really cool.  They make me feel like a little kid. <br /> <br />Disarm 9.5/10 A good song.  A wondrous array of bells and orchestral instruments for a very feely song. <br /> <br />Soma 9/10 Hmm.... I really can't think of anything to say.  Another great song <br /> <br />Geek U.S.A. 10/10 The most old school rocker.  Makes me want to headbang, but not in like a crazy hard-rock kind of way, but in a slower more flowing fashion. <br /> <br />Mayonaise 10/10 Probably my second favorite song on the album.  I'm finding it hard to breathe just thinking about it.  Starts out beautifully and transitions into it's main feel amazingly. <br /> <br />Spaceboy 10/10 The acoustic guitar and strings on this song sound very unique.  I'm running out of words to describe these songs.  I'll call this one great. <br /> <br />Silverf__k 9/10 This song kind of freaks me out a little.  I'll be relaxing to the soft flow of it when suddenly I hear Billy say \\"Bang bang you're dead, hole in your head.\\" I'll call this one wondrous. <br /> <br />Sweet sweet 9/10 This one beautiful. <br /> <br />Luna 10/10 And this one awesome.

073931646X|4.0|I feel sorry for the reviewers who think John Grisham should keep writing the same formula \\"thriller\\" over and over. He's an intelligent man and a good writer. He has lots of stories to tell and not all of them fit in the same box. I'm not reviewing this particular book because I'm still in the middle of it. Since I can't enter this message without rating it, I'll give it 4 stars, for now. I'm enjoying this book immensely, but the reviews on this page really bother me. John Grisham is not a commodity, he's not a 6-pack of Diet Coke. I believe most of these reviews would have been far different (and more favorable) if the readers hadn't known that Grisham was the author. Personally I'm in favor of any great writer taking a chance on something different.

Lewis, Alices Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass and what Alice Found There by Lewis Carroll, and The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury.<br /><br />Each time I have sat down to read The Martian Chronicles I could smell the martian soil, feel the awe and fear of the 'Second Expedition' and experience ancient Martian culture by reaching out and touching their ancient artifacts.  I did not know such writing existed until I read Mr Bradbury's work.  One can easily be spiritually transported to the ancient Martian colonies, bask in the Martian sun and stare down at the newly named ancient Martian lakes to see their reflections peering back at them.  Because that person reading the book -- you and me -- are the \\"New Martians.\\"<br /><br />The bland or overly done writing of today doesn't even compare to the sublte but direct characterization of Mars that Ray Bradbury brings to life.  This should be one of your all time favorites -- it is for me!
0066620996|4.0|<br /> <br />In his book \\"Good to Great,\\" Jim Collins and his research team explore what goes into a good company to make it great. His entire research is based on what goes in the transformation stage of a good company, after which the company not just becomes great but sustains the great results for more than 15 years. The chapters in the book explain all the essential factors that Jim and his crew found while researching on the topic of what it takes to make the company great. Following are the list of the factors which were of great interest to me:  <br />1. Leaders who channel their ego needs away from themselves and into the larger goal of building a great company contribute significantly in the company's success.  <br />2. Further, Jim explains that getting right people in company is as important as getting a right leader. He writes \\"it is important to first get the right people on the bus (and the wrong people off the bus) before you figure out where to drive it.\\" <br />3. Finally, the Hedgehog concept which explains what you can be the best in the world at and what you cannot be the best in the world at and what drives your economic engine.  <br />Apart from all above mentioned factors, I like Jim's way of beginning the book by quoting \\"Good is the Enemy of Great\\" and explaining why some companies are good and some are great. One of the main reasons that contribute to the greatness of this book is its use of simple and clear language that is easy to understand and follow. If you are really interested in knowing what makes a company great, this book is a must reading for you.  <br />
B000003TA4|1.0|Oh my god this is the worst garbage i've ever heard!! Where are the decent hooks? where are the lush backing vocals?? the production is terrible!! the guitarist doesn't even play proper solos! how many notes per second can he manage?? doesn't even compare to the great guitarists of the 80s. maybe if mutt lang produced this album you might get something vaguely listenable, but honestly i don't think even mutt or bob rock could save this album from being complete crap.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Bad bad movie. Really bad movie. A rape of the classic monster characters. Bad movie is also bad entertainment and that`s what this movie really is. Bad bad and once again really bad.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I borrowed this cd from someone and as I listened to it I realized that I HATE anything considered \\"pop-punk\\"...so go ahead and buy this cd...BUT I suggest that yousave your money for a GOOD band,not one that lost all its talent after a few years...(I also didn't like dookie alot but SOME was good)
0316172324|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell's  BLINK:  THE POWER OF THINKING WITHOUT THINKING offers a smorgasbourd of short essays in this extremely short book.  The main premise of the book emphasizes on the power of intuition and snap judgments when making decisions, and especially first impressions which may not always achieve successful results depending on a particular situation and experience one has had in the past.  In two examples, Gladwell uses Warren G. Harding, and the extremely unfortunate case of Amadou Diallo in determining that one cannot be judged by his appearance --race or good looks.  In the end, these two examples led to uncalculated failure as a result of inexperience.<br /><br />Gladwell does not present ground breaking new hypotheses, but rather allows readers to think, \\"what if...\\"  He reevaluates the evidence that each case study has previously concluded with, and shows in a reader friendly analysis that any person, regardless of their educational or social background, will either understand or gain new insight on a particular subject, such as assessing validity and authenticity of an ancient artifact, or picking the next \\"big thing\\" in the music business.  If at all, BLINK may cause readers to reevaluate their own way of thinking.<br /><br />Overall, BLINK will enlighten any reader that attempts to read it.  It's an exceptional book that only takes a couple of hours to complete.  Most likely, the book will allow those who read it to engage in further discussion or to probe each issue with a critical eye.
B00097DX3U|5.0|This is a great album which takes after Soundgarden.  Many of the songs, Man or Animal, The Worm, and Drown Me Slowly all sound like they are form a Soundgarden album.  Overall, this album is solid. <br /> <br />  Your Time has Come - good, great for background music  <br />  Out Of Exile - Great, melodic <br />  Be Yourself - Great, Melodic, Great solo,  <br />  Doesnt Remind - good, great for background music, Great guitar solo <br />  Drown Me Slowly - Just like soundgarden, great, <br />  Heavens Dead - Great, melodic, great vocals <br />  The Worm - like soundgarden, awesome song with great chorus and verse and solo, one of the best songs from the album <br />  Man or Animal - Soundgarden, greta song, greta solo <br />  Yesterday to tomorow - great, very melodic, awesome chorus <br />  Dandelion - good, for background <br />  #1 Zero - Great, Bluesy, amazing verses and chorus,  <br />  The Curse - melodic, great, cool riff, great vocals <br /> <br />All in all this album is very solid, no song is terrible and there are four or five great songs that will be audioslaves most popular.  <br />
B00004ZAV3|5.0|There is not one bad song on this album. It's all the Beatles' number one hits. It has classics like \\"Hey, Jude\\", and \\"Come together\\". All of these songs will grow on you immediately. This is the only Beatles CD you'll ever need. Period.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|You can relieve all the action and adventure with Angus MacGyver again and again. You girls get a hot stud and the guys get lots of action. Aside from the fact that there is no extras on this set, you wont be to disappointed. It was hard enough to get MacGyver released onto DVD. This is also a good show for kids to watch (not very young ones) and may get you to thinking \\"What would MacGyver do in this situation???\\" if your ever in trouble. If your an RDA fan, dont miss getting this set or any of the others as there released. You wont be dissapointed. And just think girls, you can see RDA any time you want :).
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I've had the opportunity to see this show twice (once with Idina Menzel & Kristin Chenoweth, the original witches) and it is truly powerful! The actors, music & sets are all terrific and the audiences are justifiably enthusiastic about this production!    \\"Avenue Q\\" was a fun show, but \\"Wicked\\" should have won the Best Musical Tony! In ten years, \\"Wicked\\" will likely remain on Broadway ... but will many remember \\"Avenue Q\\"?    Mr. Schwartz's score is filled with so many great songs, but standouts include:    The Wizard And I  What Is This Feeling  Popular     [Chenoweth's big song]  I'm Not That Girl  Defying Gravity     [Menzel's powerful end to Act I & the classic of the show]  As Long As You're Mine  For Good    Mr. Schwartz should have won for Best Score as these songs have real staying-power.  At least he got the Grammy for Best Cast Album!    A truly great listen!!!
B000002GJH|5.0|And he formed what could have been THE band to rule the rock world in the 90's, not that Pearl Jam and Soundgarden didn't rule any less, but Cornell is simply to amazing to put into words here, none will do it justice. He flows so amazingly well with with Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament and of course, Matt Cameron on the drums, written without any experimenting and pretty much on a whim, Cornell and the gang turned out one of the best musical treasures i've ever heard, all you have to do is listen to \\"Reach Down\\" and you will understand Temple's greatness, all summed up in an 11 minute oddysey. and of course who could forget the rock majestry that is \\"Hunger Strike\\" in a duet with Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, Cornell and the aforementioned frontman put together an incredible 4 minute duet that is worthy of all classic rock. hell, every song is amazing, Say Hello 2 Heaven, All Night Thing, Times Of Trouble, Wooden Jesus. Enough reading, if you have any musical sense at all, you will buy this record.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I saw the Phantom of the Opera just this weekend, and I thought that the film was a pretty faithful adaptation to the emotion of the story. I think that what people need to remember while watching is that it is and adaption, and in no way should be compared to the stage play. People who do so will be disappointed. There are no theatrical movements like the stage production (on a 30 foot screen, these movements would appear garish anyway). If you can look at it for what it is...  which is an epic, and very emotional film you'll not be disappointed. The sets are amazing, and the production lavish. I recommend it whole-heartedly. <br /> <br />As far as cast goes, I don't think that they could have done better. I love Gerard Butler as the Phantom. He has a huge presence on camera, and a beautiful raw voice. For an actor that remains masked throughout most of the movie, be brings the emotion of the Phantom to life and lets us believe that the character is more than just a monster. Because he's masked, most of his expression is in his eyes, and the emotion conveyed there is amazing and heartrending. Emmy Rossum is amazing as his counterpart with a pristine, and operatic voice. Her preformance  here could really give Sarah Brightman a run for her money. Patrick Wilson was my only real problem with this film. Although he has a beautiful, clear voice he just doesn't carry the same presence as the rest of the characters do. It is in a word, sublime (as the Phantom himself would say I'm sure).
B000669GAI|5.0|Pearl Jam is what it is, and I won't bore anyone with a love letter to them. Suffice it to say that they're among my all-time favorites. What I will do is tell you what makes this collection worth buying even if you're an old fan who owns all their albums individually. <br /> <br />First and foremost are the remixed versions of \\"Once\\", \\"Alive\\" and \\"Black\\". One of the only complaints I had with the Ten album was that it always sounded overproduced, and dampened the strength of the guitar and vocal work with too many studio effects. Listen to the original Ten versions and you'll hear lots of awful reverb and echo. Then listen to the versions on Rearviewmirror...the new mixes do away with all that crap and just allow the songs to shine on the strength of the band's performance. Much, much better. <br /> <br />Another reason is the presence of the \\"re-recorded\\" version of Even Flow, used in the music video. This version, far superior to the album cut, has been favored by radio stations for years, but has only been publicly available on obscure singles. Here it is. <br /> <br />Additionally, this is a great opportunity to get copies of some of their more rare non-album singles, like I Got Id and Man of the Hour. There's also Yellow Ledbetter, which has been a big hit for the band almost from the beginning but has only been previously available in stores on a very old single and on the Lost Dogs rarities set (a great companion to this one). <br /> <br />Even if you own their albums, this is a great \\"car set\\"...the kind you can leave in your car all the time and have a rich trove of music to hear on a short trip. Get it.
B0000001PW|5.0|If you want to hear the Elektric band, this is the album you just have to hear first! This album is the essence of everything Corea's trio was and probaly will be.  <br /> <br />Besides just completely sounding straight out of the 1980's, the possibly worst decade for music; this album, musically is just fantastic. <br /> <br />Obviously the acoustic and straight ahead fans won't like this, and right from the title most of them are turned away. I was one of them. But then I got into this little thing called fusion and found out that over time, that it evolved in such a way to produce great albums like this. <br /> <br />The Chick Corea Elektric Band was one of those colorful jazz groups in the 80's to just turn on nice melodic jazz/rock/pop/fusion music. No matter how the critics and jazz purists try to catogorize this into flimsy worthless jazz idioms, I must say, as a lover of  jazz  of any kind (excluding that awful R&B influenced popular radio deamed as 'smooth jazz') I aboslutely love the music on this disk. <br /> <br />All musicians were top notch at the time, and went on to become great successers. Chick is absolutely spoken for as John Pattitucci and Dave Weckl prove to be two of jazz's greatest rhythm team players. <br /> <br />I own a copy of this band playing a gig around the time this album came out, and the band was absolutely perfect. King Cockroach will always be my favorite. And India Town has one of those distinctive melodies. <br /> <br />Overall, the album is just a nostalgic trip through the 80's, but never-the-less, it's great jazz!
B0001I55OC|2.0|I wish I hadn't read Michael Crichton's Timeline novel so that I could simply say this is another bland action picture  in a period setting from unimaginative storytellers which neither offends nor thrills. Unfortunately, having read the book, I know better. There was a lot of squandered potential which makes this film willfully bland and disappointing rather than accidentally so.<br /><br />The basic story is about a group of archaeologists who travel back in time to the 1400's to rescue a fellow archaeologist who is stranded in time. That much of the story is the same as the novel. The problem is that the movie is poorly paced such that there is little drama and that the characters aren't sufficiently fleshed out to make you care if (or when) they die. The bulk of the story seems geared toward getting the heroes repeatedly captured and having them escape as well as to get to the battle scenes as quickly and as frequently as possible.<br /><br />I'm not one of those people who feel that a novel should be slavishly adhered to at a movie's expense. Books clearly needed to be adapted but they should always lose detail or have the story restructured to the benefit of a movie, not to its detriment as was the case here. For instance, the means by which the characters time travel is altered and greatly simplified compared to the book and that was a good idea.<br /><br />However, some of the best visual scenes in the book are simply not used in the movie for no reason that I can think of rather than being overly cheap. The opening scene is an excellent example. (Spoiler) When a person repeatedly travels in the story, there are alignment errors which creep into their reconstituted form. In the book, this is shown by a man whose face, body, and even clothing appear to be out of alignment. Instead of doing a little makeup and sewing to show this, a fellow is X-rayed and we're shown microscopic details of this misalignment. As an opening scene, the impact of a slightly and weirdly deformed man mysteriously showing up would have made for much better drama and suspense than the opening scene of the movie. (end spoiler)<br /><br />It's disappointing that such an interesting book was made into such a boring movie. I hope Michael Crichton sold as many books for this novel as he'd hoped to already because the fact that the movie is so weak is sure to turn people off to the book.and weirdly deformed man mysteriously showing up would have made for much better drama and suspense than the opening scene of the movie.

B00005K9LK|5.0|If there`s any studio album that showcases Judas Priest at their best, it`s Screaming For Vengeance. This album is not only one of the great albums ever made, but also one of those few albums that`s perfect from start to finish and very addictive to listen to. Rob Halford`s singing on the album is great and Glen Tipton and K.K. Downing`s twin guitar attack is at their best. Favorite songs: The Hellion/Electric Eye, Bloodstone, (Take These) Chains, the title cut, and Fever.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|It wasn't the best decision of my life.  My wife and I were double dating with another couple and trying to determine what movie to watch.  Our choices narrowed down to two: Black Hawk Down, or A Beautiful Mind.  So we voted.  It was two to two, the guys won and we watched Black Hawk Down.  As we left the movie the girls were shell shocked.  Never again, they vowed, would they let the guys choose the movie.  You got to understand why we didn't want to watch A Beautiful Mind.  Get this; it is a movie about a mathematician.  Wow! Didn't that sound exciting?   A couple of years later, we rented the DVD and I was truly amazed that the quality and depth of this movie.  The gals were right, A Beautiful Mind was the better movie.     Ron Howard pulled a sucker punch on me.  He pulled me into this movie and then. . . well, if you haven't see it, I don't want to spoil it for you by giving the plot away.  Trust me on this, this is a great movie.  Careful and deliberate editing, a riveting sound track and top notch performances keep this movie moving.  Far from being a bore, it draws the viewer in and holds our attention.  Kudos for Russell Crowe, despite his Gladiator physic was downright convincing as the nerdy John Nash.  Outstanding performances all the way around.  If you haven't seen this movie, put it on you're A-List.
B00080ZG10|4.0|Howard Hughes was a facinating and complex American icon. The same can be said for screen legend Katherine Hepburn. I was astounded by the depth of portrayal displayed by both Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett in breathing life into these legendary, larger than life personalities. Someone once commented that going into the film, could not imagine DiCaprio playing Howard Hughes but by the end, could not imagine anyone ELSE in that role. I totally agree. DiCaprio was that good. Equally, Blanchett never faultered in her dead on portrayal of Hepburn. Bravo, bravo. The film, a bit longish at 170 minutes focused on the 20 year slice of Hughes' life between 1927 and 1947 and sometimes bogged down unnecessarily, but on the whole was a typically excellent piece of filmmaking by director Martin Scorsese. Buy this one, you'll not be dissappointed.
B00005MAM2|5.0|Akira the animated film is a different animal from it's original comic book/graphic novel series. The printed series is far superior to this animated one and if you just plop in the DVD you're more than likely going to be confused as to what's happening in the end. Tetsuo's power is so overwhelming that he cannot control it thus it manifests itself in the grotesque flesh mutation we see at the end of the movie. In the books this happens over a long period of time so we know exactly what is happening to him. Akira himself appears in the book series as a little boy but in the film we see him in parts contained in jars of liquid. When you know the difference between what we read and what we see in this film then can we only appreciate what Akira is really about. <br /> <br />I would not recommend this DVD to anyone unless you have read through the paper series and can understand what the whole story is about. If you're just a technical junkie then the animation prowess Otomo presents in this film may be enough to get you to like it. <br /> <br />Overall the series is an absolute must read and the film itself is good but is rather condensed which is what is confusing a lot of the reviewers I have read through.
B00078XGRO|5.0|This movie is a big knockout with sourround sound.  I like Star Trek and I like the next generation show the best.  This beats all star trek movies.  Patrick Stewart really did great and so did Data.  The borg queen made Data act very different.  The most famous line in the movie is by Worf which is \\" Perhaps today is a good day today\\".  That is classic.  I love the scfi movies where they go into space life.  Even if you don't care for Star Trek very much this is still a must see film.  This probaly had the most action out of all the star trek movies and also has some comedy relief in it.  There are more dramatic star trek movies than this but that's okay.  The dvd was great and far better than the first dvd of this.  It has a quality picture.  Patrick Stewart was terrible in X-men and he knows that Star Trek was the best thing that he ever acted in and everybody knows that.  So if you like scfi movies then buy it. God bless you and have a great day.
B000002A3T|5.0|...from start to finnish -and probably my favorite Pink Floyd-album. This is referred to as \\"the third Pink Floyd\\", and I agree. First it was under the spell of Syd Barret (The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, also contributed on A Saucerful Of Secrets), then to the magic of Roger Waters (The Wall, The Final Cut and many, many more...) until the time had come for the circus of David Gilmour. No doubt, David Gilmour is the most talented musician of the four. In an interview in some newspaper once Roger Waters actually managed to call him the oposite; \\"David Gilmour never came up with one good idea!\\" was the exact words as I recall, and first then I realized there is something very arrogant and egosentric about Roger Waters -and of course it has become some part of his \\"image\\" as in the fate of \\"his\\" band, but come on; Waters undeniable played a big part in bringing Floyd to fame, but he was not alone -and some of his songs would never have sounded as beautiful as indeed they do if it hadn't been for the inspiring guitar-work and vocal of David Gilmour. I'm a big fan also of Waters' solo-work, but the man can't sing -and that's probably one reason for his change of composing, there are limitations to his genious -this being said; I am a big fan, and please -do not get me wrong now, it's just that I find all this negativity around the \\"new\\" Floyd (post Waters) highly unfair. The Division Bell is a masterpiece, and shows signs of creativity and engagement, a lyrically and poetic wonder, mixed with the beautiful and haunting compositions (Gilmour in the lead) and various sound- effects (\\"earth noises\\" -fantastic) -one of the most inspiring albums ever made by any band ever existed. There are no songs I skip on this album, not one! Therefor a five star-rating. It's a bit \\"unfit\\" to even try to compare it to \\"The Wall\\" nor \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" -but the weaknesses that I have always found with both these releases is some \\"skipability\\" among the highlights, or in other words -some Waters' composotions, however experimental, sound awful. \\"The Wall\\" is complete as a masterpiece as a story behind the music with the music and the lyrics telling it (and a painful and disturbing one as well, though I have no problem understanding its' theme and the depth of it, not at all), but parts of this double-album is seldom played (well, in my apartment that is) and I find it a bit overrated, not just because of the b-sides of the music, but it is not very personal (and, yes, I actually think so!) -in fact it's a bit tricky to explain, I admire Waters in some ways, but also find him as a self-sentered spoiled rock star in others (of course I don't know him personally, but it's just an impression over the years he has given...).    Well, back to \\"The Division Bell\\" -a big improvement after \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\" (the first post-Waters), a good album absolutely -but far from being as complete and as \\"epic\\" as \\"The Division Bell\\" (\\"Learning To Fly\\" and \\"Sorrow\\" sounding so much better live on both \\"A Delicate Sound Of Thunder\\" and \\"Pulse\\"). People describing the post-Waters-album as uninspiring and weak is beyond me. \\"The Division Bell\\" is the best of them all, and I am sure the more opened minded fans agree with me on that. And Waters now being bitter, it was Syd Barret who started the legend -not him. At least I believe that many old fans had doomed this release long before it was even planned, such style and passion should not be ignored. But hey, it's you ears..!    Seriously; One of the best albums ever made -Pink Floyd defienes music! Talented musicians and composers in an impressive \\"comeback\\" (it was then). And I hope you'll discover this too.
B0006284JQ|5.0|We all know who Britney Spears is. Britney has been one of the most successful female recording artists since that of Madonna & Cher. From 1999 to 2003, Britney had released four albums entitled: ...BABY ONE MORE TIME (1999), OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN (2000), BRITNEY (2001), & IN TH ZONE (2003). But in 2004, Britney released her fifth album entitled, GREATEST HITS: MY PREROGATIVE. This album is Britney's first greatest hits compilation that features fourteen of Britney's best songs, along with three new songs.  <br /> <br />MY PREROGATIVE  <br />New song. The first single from the album. Back in 1988, Bobby Brown had recorded this song and it was one Bobby's major hits. Now, I am more than fond of Bobby Brown's version. But when I heard Britney's version, I was more than impressed. So impressed, in fact I thought that Bobby Brown would be happy with this version.  <br /> <br />TOXIC  <br />From the album In The Zone (2003). This was the second single from the fourth album, and another one of Britney's #1 hit singles. This is one hell of a classic song. The sound is just unbelievably ingenious. Gotta love seeing Britney wearing that see-through rhinestone outfit in the song's music video.  <br /> <br />I'M A SLAVE 4 U  <br />From the album Britney (2001). The third album was incredible, just like its first single. The song talks about how Britney feels like a slave to the music she is dancing to. I think that this song's music video was Britney's most sexual yet, where she is dancing with all guys, where she appears to sweating heavily. The dance moves are so risqu, Madonna would have been proud of it.  <br /> <br />OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN  <br />From the album Oops!...I Did It Again (2000). This was yet another #1 hit for Ms. Spears. The whole album was one of Britney's greatest works and it will always be one of my favorite albums. The music video to this song is nothing more than ingenious.  <br /> <br />ME AGAINST THE MUSIC (Duet with Madonna)  <br />From the albumIn The Zone (2003). Madonna has been my biggest idol for the past nine years, and to have Madonna and Britney sing this incredible song together was the one of the best things I had ever heard. When the ladies were rehearsing for their opening number for the 2003 MTV VMAs, Britney had let Madonna hear this song, and that was when Britney had said to Madonna, \\"...You have to be on this song...\\". Madonna thought it a swell idea and recorded her vocals onto the song.  <br /> <br />STRONGER  <br />From the album Oops!...I Did It Again (2000). This is one of my favorite songs from the second album because of incredible sound in music. The video will always be one of Britney's greatest music videos of all time.  <br /> <br />EVERYTIME  <br />From the album In The Zone (2003). When I first heard this song, I fell in love with instantly and hoped that Britney would release it as a single. As it would turn out, Britney did release it as a single. The video was quite disturbing. It shows Britney with actor, Stephen Dorff, who came to act as Britney's boyfriend. The two are rushing through a crowd of papparzzi. As they reach Britney's place, Britney heads off into the bathroom and readies herself for a bath. As she sits in the bath, she slides underneath the water, performing an onscreen suicide, which disturbed many people around the world.  <br /> <br />...BABY ONE MORE TIME  <br />From the album ...Baby One More Time (1999). Britney's first single and first #1 hit. Everytime I hear this song, I always think of the time when this song and album were first released. It was the spring of 1999, I was coming towards the end of my eighth grade year and I remember when I got this album, I listened to it 24/7. This song and album takes me back to my eighth grade year.  <br /> <br />(YOU DRIVE ME) CRAZY (The Stop! Remix)  <br />From the original motion picture & soundtrack Drive Me Crazy (1999). Original version from the album ...Baby One More Time (1999). Now, you will find the original version of this song on Britney's first album. The song was released as a single, but for the video, Britney decided to use this remix, in order to provide the edgy dance moves.  <br /> <br />BOYS (The Co-ed Remix) (Duet with Pharrell Williams of N.E.R.D.)  <br />From the original motion picture soundtrack Austin Powers In Goldmember (2002). Original version from the album Britney (2001). For this song, Britney did the same thing as she did with (You Drive Me) Crazy. The original version of this song, which can be found on Britney's third album, was released as the single, but this remix was used for the video.  <br /> <br />SOMETIMES  <br />From the album ...Baby One More Time (1999). Britney's second single and one of her absolute best. The music video is one my favorites, because it takes place in Malibu, CA. I just thought that the location was perfect.  <br /> <br />OVERPROTECTED (The Darkchild Remix Radio Edit)  <br />Original version from the album Britney (2001). Although, I love the song, this remix is not worth listening to.  <br /> <br />LUCKY  <br />From the album Oops!...I Did It Again (2000). This is a great song with a great story line about an actress named Lucky, who has everything, while being a big celebrity, but she is very unhappy.  <br /> <br />OUTRAGEOUS  <br />From the album In The Zone (2003). Great song, with a great sound.  <br /> <br />I'M NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN  <br />From the album Britney (2001). This is one of the best ballads Britney has every sang, for it talks about seeing her as an adult, instead of an overprotected child.  <br /> <br />I'VE JUST BEGUN (HAVING MY FUN)  <br />New song. Not bad.  <br /> <br />DO SOMETHIN'  <br />New song. The second single from the album. Great song.  <br /> <br />Even though, \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\", \\"Born To Make You Happy\\", & \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\" were not included, this album is still a must-have album. Buy this album and enjoy it. With this album, you get abonus CD with four Britney remixes, and fifth remix, which turns out to be the \\"Chris Cox Megamix\\". The Chris Cox Megamix is actually a medley containing the songs: ...BABY ONE MORE TIME/(YOU DRIVE ME) CRAZY (The Stop! Remix)/I'M A SLAVE 4 U/OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN/STRONGER/EVERYTIME/OVERPROTECTED/TOXIC.
B00009V7T2|5.0|It runs through like one great massive epic of a song. Every second is something new and better than the last. The story line is hard to figure out and takes awhile to get your own interpretation but thats part of the appeal of this record. Awesome guitar parts, excellent vocals, The Mars Volta is the closest to a perfect band we have today.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney became a big star with the incredible debut album ...Baby One More Time (1999). Now, a year after the release of her debut, Britney brings us her second album OOPS!... I DID IT AGAIN. Britney knew what she was doing when she recorded this album. She knew she was going to get a huge response with the release of this album. I bought the album the day it was released. I listened to the entire album the night that I bought it and I was more than impressed.  <br /> <br />OOPS!... I DID IT AGAIN <br />The album's title track and the album's first single. This song was destined to become a hit. In this one, Britney tells her boyfriend that she just played him. She tells him that she's not into him and that she's \\"not that innocent\\". The video takes place on Mars, where Britney takes up a modified VANESSA KENNSINGTON (from AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY) look. Instead of being a brunette, whose hair goes down to the middle of the back, Britney keeps her natural blonde look and adds extensions that go down to the middle of her back. Instead of wearing a black leather jumpsuit with the zipper opened enough to show cleevage, Britney wears a red leather jumpsuit with no openings whatsoever. In September of 2000, Britney was scheduled to perform at the 2000 MTV VMAs. She started her performance by singing a part of (I CAN'T GET NO) SATISFACTION. She was wearing a black suit with silver glittered stripes. She descended down a staircase and broke into the fast part of the song. As she began the song in the second verse, she ripped off the outfit, revealing a sequence bikini top with sequence pants to match. After the quick, but sexy costume change, Britney broke into Oops!. This was the first of many very sexy live performances from Britney.  <br /> <br />STRONGER <br />The album's third single. Out of all the songs on the album, this one is my favorite. In this song, Britney says that her boyfriend treated her like crap and how he always thought that she would never make it on her own. But she tells him that she's a lot stronger than he is and that she too can survive without him. The video is one of Britney's best without a doubt. The music video takes place in a dark, gothic futuristic city and a futuristic club. When the video starts, the song doesn't start right away. The video starts off with Britney in the futuristic club. She is standing front of her boyfriend, who is with another woman. Britney looks at him angrily and says, \\"Whatever\\". That's when the song starts up. For the club scenes and the scenes where Britney is driving, she is wearing this black long-sleeved stitch-like half-top and a black skirt that is short going across her thighs and becomes longer when it goes down her right thigh. For the scenes when Britney is dancing with the chair, she wears a similar black half-top, but with black pants, with pom-pom like bell-bottoms.  <br /> <br />DON'T GO KNOCKIN' ON MY DOOR <br />An okay song.  <br /> <br />(I CAN'T GET NO) SATISFACTION <br />This song was originally made famous by THE ROLLING STONES. But their version, how do I say this, sucks. Britney had enough common sense to make it sound better. This one talks about how her boyfriend gives her everything and she's still not satisfied. It's a remake that no one should ever dare to miss.  <br /> <br />DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW <br />The album's fourth & final single. This song was written by Robert J. Lange, Shania Twain's husband. For this one, Britney decided to take a break from the usual break-up tunes and decided to go with a love song. In this one, she is talking to the guy who is really in love with her and she tells him that if it's all true, she wants him to let her be the first to know, not the last. The video showed Britney in her most sexy image. In the video, she wears a white bikini top and jean shorts that are a lot shorter than we had expected.  <br /> <br />WHAT U SEE (IS WHAT U GET) <br />This is not a break-up song. It's a casual love song, but with the wagging finger. Britney tells her boyfriend that she doesn't care about how he is having a problem with her way of dressing. She tells him that \\"what he sees is what he's getting\\".  <br /> <br />LUCKY <br />The album's second single. A song that totally separates itself from the rest of the album. This one talks about an actress named LUCKY who is indeed very lucky. She has everything: Money, Fans, More Fame than anybody ever bargained for, the whole pack. But she is not happy. How could someone like LUCKY not be happy? It is because she has no life. She has no time for herself or for her family. She has no time to find her true love. In the video, Britney plays a dual role: herself and... LUCKY!  <br /> <br />ONE KISS FROM YOU <br />Great. <br /> <br />WHERE YOU ARE <br />One of the most prettiest ballads I've ever heard.  <br /> <br />I CAN'T MAKE YOU LOVE ME <br />Okay.  <br /> <br />DEAR DIARY <br />This is the first song that Britney had ever written. It talks about Britney, of course, writing in her Diary. In her diary she writes that she saw a particular guy that is definitely attracted to Britney and Britney is in every way attracted to him, but she doesn't know how to approach him.  <br /> <br />This is definitely Britney's best album and as many times as I heard it, I never get tired of it. This album should be owned by every Britney fan around the world. No exceptions.
B00005JKED|5.0|This movie was hands down amazing.  And also, believe it or not, the story line was very believable.  Although Denzel Washingtons character was doing things which, as a cop, seem unbelievable, and things the LAPD would never let slide, events much like this did occur.  David Mack, Rafael Perez, Kevin Gaines.   <br /> <br />Kevin Gaines- Was half gang banger, half cop.  Had been reported on several occasions as commiting fealonies, never convicted in court.  Aimed his gun at an undercover cop, Frank Lyga one day and Lyga shot back, and was convicted of a racist murderer. <br /> <br />Rafael Perez- How much can you say about this man.  I think that Perez could have been the man Denzels' character was based upon.  If you havent heard about the LAPD's CRASH unit, look it up.  They would act as gang bangers to catch gangbangers.  The intimidation factor they called it.  And perez was no exception.  He has been convicted of multiple murders, assaults, and burgulries of drugdealers and gang bangers.  Is now out of jail i believe. <br /> <br />David Mack- Helped out and was friends with Perez, part of LAPD, and robbed a bank.   <br /> <br />These are just some of the many stories about dirty LAPD officers.  If you want to know more, read Labyrinth: A detective inestigates the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G., the implications of Death Row Records' Suge Knight, and the origins of the LAPD scandal by Randall Sullivan <br /> <br />Back to the movie, well acted and directed.  Great movie, watch it.
B00005OM4N|5.0|First, it was 1999's ...BABY ONE MORE TIME. Then, it was 2000's OOPS!... I DID IT AGAIN. But in 2001, Britney had come back with her third album entitled, BRITNEY. The album coincides with the film CROSSROADS, Britney's first major starring role. This album is sort of more on how she is growing up. The album shot straight to the No. 1 spot when it was released.  <br /> <br />I'M A SLAVE 4 U <br />The album's first single. The song talks about how Britney wants to be let go of because she's not a little girl. She's a young woman who \\"really wants to dance tonight with you\\". She says that the music makes her \\"a slave for you\\", so all she wants to do is dance.  <br /> <br />OVERPROTECTED <br />The album's third single. This one is of the theme songs from CROSSROADS. In this one, Britney talks about that she has always been overprotected and she wants everybody to stop because she's no longer a little girl. She's saying that everybody is trying to protect her from making mistakes, but we all know that we make mistakes and when we do, we all learn from them. Britney has to do that, even if she does not want to make any mistakes, she knows that it's gonna happen, but she's not worried because she knows she'll learn from them.  <br /> <br />LONELY <br />Not bad. Just your average break-up song.  <br /> <br />I'M NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN <br />The second single from the album. We all know what Britney means here, so stop with all the \\"What are you? A boy or a man?\\" jokes. Britney is saying that she is no longer a girl. What makes her no longer a girl is that she has grown-up, both physically, mentally, and her age says so. She has learned a lot when she was a girl, but she still has a lot to learn before she becomes a woman. That's what the song is about. This was the second theme song from CROSSROADS.  <br /> <br />BOYS <br />The fourth single from the album. Remember back when Britney did (YOU DRIVE ME) CRAZY? Instead of releasing the album version as the single, she remixed it into (YOU DRIVE ME) CRAZY (The Stop! Remix) and made it the theme to 1999's DRIVE ME CRAZY. She did the same for this song. Instead of releasing this version of BOYS, she remixed it into BOYS (The Co-ed Remix) and she had Pharrell Williams of N.E.R.D. provide his vocals, turning it into a duet. The Co-ed remix was released as a single and made the theme song to AUSTIN POWERS in GOLDMEMBER. Both Britney and Pharrell make their appearances in the video. One more person makes an appearance in the video. Guess who, baby, yeah!  <br /> <br />ANTICIPATING <br />Not a bad song.  <br /> <br />I LOVE ROCK 'N ROLL <br />The fifth and final single from the album. Before Britney could talk, this classic song was originally recorded by the infamous Joan Jett. Evem though Joan Jett's version is much better, because of it's real edged heavy rock sound combined with Joan's rock voice and rock style, Britney re-did this song with the intention of a classic and succeeded.  <br /> <br />CINDERELLA <br />From this album, this song is definitely my favorite. She talks about how her boyfriend always referred to her as \\"Cinderella\\" and she's fed up with his crap. She tells him that she's leaving him for good, in other words \\"Cinderella's got to go\\". My favorite part of the song is the spoken verse which goes like this: I USED TO SAY I WANT YOU. YOU CAST ME IN YOUR SPELL. I DID EVERYTHING YOU WANTED ME TO, BUT NOW I SHALL BREAK FREE FROM ALL YOUR LIES. I WON'T BE BLIND, YOU SEE. MY LOVE, IT CAN'T BE SACRIFICED. I WON'T RETURN TO THEE.  <br /> <br />LET ME BE <br />Not bad.  <br /> <br />BOMBASTIC LOVE <br />Great song!  <br /> <br />THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE ME <br />Okay!  <br /> <br />WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME <br />Everyone thought that this song was a duet between Britney and ex-beau Justin Timberlake. Again, they are wrong. Justin Timberlake and Wade J. Robsin wrote the song and Justin provided the back-ups. That's all. Not a bad song.  <br /> <br />A great album by a great artist. An album that should be owned by every Britney fan.
0140366954|4.0|Since it took me some time to get this book, I was very excited to start reading it. It was indeed fun to return to the world and characters that I have like so much in the first book.<br /><br />I can't say I was disappointed, it was a great, fast and flowing reading. I enjoyed the book very much.<br /><br />However, in my opinion it is not as good as the first book. Perhaps because, like any sequel, it is an extension of a good thing that stands for its own right. Perhaps, because I am still young myself, I was able to connect more to the teenaged heroes than to the adult and married ones.<br /><br />However, it was a great joy to meet them all again, and I think it is a good and worthy sequel, although it can't be compared to the first.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|In 2003, Britney released her fourth album entitled, IN THE ZONE. It was only just a few months after Britney and Christina Aguilera had shared their onscreen kiss with the Queen Diva: Madonna. This album is really good, but it was not as good as her first three. <br /> <br />ME AGAINST THE MUSIC (featuring Madonna)  <br />The first single from the album. Britney had originally recorded this song by herself. When she, Madonna, Christina, and Missy were rehearsing for their MTV performance, Britney let Madonna hear the song. Then Britney told Madonna that Madonna had to be on it, turning the song into a duet. Madonna accepted the offer, of course. In the video, Madonna plays this strange woman who attracts Britney into the club she is in. Britney desperately searches for Madonna because she feels Madonna's spirit luring all over. An awesome Diva Duet. <br /> <br />(I GOT THAT) BOOM BOOM (featuring YING YANG TWINS)  <br />Not a great song.  <br /> <br />SHOWDOWN  <br />An okay song.  <br /> <br />BREATHE ON ME  <br />This is my favorite track off the album. Britney really went over the hill with being sexy. She sings the song in a low sexy voice that no man will ever resist.  <br /> <br />EARLY MORNIN'  <br />Pretty Good.  <br /> <br />TOXIC  <br />The second single from the album. This is a great song, but I am sick and tired of hearing it because Q-102 is constantly play it.  <br /> <br />OUTRAGEOUS  <br />The fourth & final single from the album. Great song.  <br /> <br />TOUCH OF MY HAND  <br />Not bad.  <br /> <br />THE HOOK UP  <br />Great Song.  <br /> <br />SHADOW  <br />Beautiful.  <br /> <br />BRAVE NEW GIRL  <br />I'm hoping she makes this a single. It's a great song. It talks about Britney becoming a brave new girl.  <br /> <br />EVERYTIME  <br />The third single from the album. The is a great ballad. The video caused some controversy due to the fact that Britney went with an on-screen suicide.  <br /> <br />ME AGAINST THE MUSIC (featuring Madonna) (RishiRich's Kulcha Remix) <br />Awesome remix.  <br /> <br />You see, there is no doubt that Britney is one of this world's best DIVAS. I order all of you Britney fans to buy this one if you didn't already.
B00005JNTX|1.0|I have actually read and enjoyed Frank Miller's comics, and really loved the Kill Bill series.   <br /> <br />Once you get over the \\"hey neat\\" factor of the movie's use of color to achieve its comic book style, you are left with a movie that is relentlessly, gruesomely and - for the most part - pointlessly violent.  The characters are all, well, comic book cutouts and some are supposed to be \\"protagonists\\" and some \\"antagonists\\" (there are no good guys or bad guys, they are all bad), but you really don't care what happens to any of them.  This movie was one of the rare occasions when I almost walked out in the middle...
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This Album Is Ten Times Better Than Steal This Album I love The Whole Album But mY Favorite Tracks Are B.Y.O.B. Cigaro Sad Statue And Lost In Holloywood A Great Album  I Recommend It Definnetly
B00003CXXP|2.0|Yes it is a technically well done film, and there is all sorts of neat stuff in it.  But I found myself growing weary of the relentlessness with which the main character is made to suffer.  And the little teddy bear robot is really annoying.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|As a fellow musician, I can really appreciate the Eagles flawless performances. The Eagles are without a doubt, the best live band out there. I can probably count, on one hand, the number of bands, that can pull off the same vocal harmonies, live! Hole in the World, really showcases their harmonies, and when I heard it, live from Melborne, I just watched in awe, and amazement. As a drummer, I panicked when they performed their first song, with Don Henley out front. I thought OH!NO! don't tell me Don has forsaken his drumkit, but, fortunately he performed most of the show behind his kit. Awesome!! I can't wait to get the DVD!! <br />
B000002572|5.0|I`VE BEEN LISTENING TO BOSTON SINCE 1976 WHEN THIS ALBUM CAME OUT. THEREFORE I HAVE THIS RECORDING BOTH IN LP AND CD(GOLD) FORMAT. THE MUSIC IN THIS RECORDING IS TIMELESS. IT WAS AS IF IT WAS JUST RELEASED RECENTLY. EVERY MUSIC LOVER SHOULD HAVE A COPY OF THIS FANTASTIC RECORDING. IT RANKS ON TOP OF MY CD COLLECTIONS WHICH AMOUNTS TO ABOUT 500. UNFORTUNATELY AFTER THE 3RD ALBUM, THEIR MUSIC BEGAN TO DECLINE. THE THREE BAND MEMBERS ESPECIALLY TOM, BRAD & BARRY ARE THE MAIN CONTRIBUTORS TO THE SOUND OF BOSTON. THE FANTASTIC GUITARING BETWEEN TOM & BARRY AND THE SIREN VOCALS OF BRAD DELP ARE UNMATCHED. I HOPE THIS RECORDING WILL BE REPACKED IN DUAL DISC FORMAT. ONE SIDE THEIR REMASTERED RECORDING PLUS THE FLIP SIDE, THE VIDEO OF MORE THAN A FEELING PLUS ADDED LIVE FOOTAGE OF THEIR PERFORMANCES. RUMOURS HAS IT THAT THERE WILL BE AN UPCOMING DVD RELEASE OF THEIR LIFE PEFORMANCES. MEANWHILE JUST GET THIS CD AND ENJOY IT. IT`S DEFINETLY MORE THAT A FEELING JUST LISTENING TO THIS RECORDING.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I first heard for Gavin when I first heard the opening song for the show One Tree Hill. It was a song I Don't Wanna Be and I liked it so much that I got his whole cd. After listening to it for the first time, I was so impressed by this music, that I just couldn't believe my ears. The lyrics of all the songs are about love in one way or another. Chariot is such a great album, where all the songs are so great, that I just can't get used of hearing them over and over again. I Don't Wanna Be is still the best song, and of course my favourite, but there are also some other songs that really deserve mentioning.<br /><br />Follow Through is a great easy song. I really, really like the beginning of song. It's an easy start, which is slowly developing to a slightly more lively song.<br /><br />Chariot is more lively song, probably one of the most lively songs on the cd, with especially good chours. Catchy tune is what makes this song and especially the chours so great.<br /><br />The next song Just Friends is a love ballad with really nice lyrics about a girl who was cheating on his boyfriend but he's willing to forgive her. My favourite part of the song: ''...but you were just friends, at least that's what you said...'' It's so cool.<br /><br />The song Nice Too Meet You Anyway is more optimistic song, with interesting lyrics. He just found someone special. Well, you have to hear it for yourself.<br /><br />More Than Anyone is the nicest ballad. Really good tune and really nice lyrics. He's telling a girl that he'll be by her side and that hell ''...I'm gonna love you more than anyone<br />I'm gonna hold you closer than before...'' I mean just a perfect love ballad.<br /><br />Overrated starts really easy and then turns in a more lively song about how he likes this girl and ''...whatever you want and more<br />what I'm anticipating, everything else will be overrated...''<br /><br />And here's my favourite song I Don't Wanna Be. This song is different than the others. There's more rock in this tune and also the lyrics aren't about love. He says: ''...I dont want to be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately...''<br /><br />The other songs that I haven't yet mentioned (Chemical Party, Belief, Crush and Meaning) are also great songs. They just didn't stuck in my mind as much as others because I didn't listen to them as many times as I did to the others. But after listening to it for a couple more times, you'll find out, that this songs too are really cool song. So I can say, that I was really impressed by Gavin's Chariot.ve. He says: ''...I dont want to be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately...''    The other songs that I haven't yet mentioned (Chemical Party, Belief, Crush and Meaning) are also great songs. They just didn't stuck in my mind as much as others because I didn't listen to them as many times as I did to the others. But after listening to it for a couple more times, you'll find out, that this songs too are really cool song. So I can say, that I was really impressed by Gavin's Chariot.
B00003W8NM|4.0|The accusations that this film romanticizes fascism and violence are a full load of crappy rubbish.     Fight Club is an black comedy about frustration that finally leads into a total anarchy. The world view and the attitudes in this film are absurdly nihilistic and satirically exaggerated.
0316172324|2.0|This book is well-written and engaging, but it only states what most people already know. One of the book's concluding points is that if you are skilled and experienced in your field, then being able to quickly make decisive and correct decisions will come naturally. Nothing new there. Some people would simply say \\"with experience comes intuition.\\" The author further notes that unless one is fully trained, the initial gut reaction can be misleading for a number of reasons, such as subconscious bias or stress. An abundance of stories is presented to support all the points in the book, but most adults will have already come across all the issues through lifelong experience. <br /> <br />One thing for which I was hoping was a discussion on how to hone yourself to make better \\"blink\\" decisions outside your field of expertise. The author does not address this at all except for one small suggestion saying that it's better to reduce the amount of information one has to process in order to make a good decision. This approach is a good idea, but the author delves no further. <br />
0790742780|5.0|I somehow managed to miss this movie when it was new and saw it for the first time a few days ago (circa mid 2005) and have been haunted by it ever since.  Michael Douglas gives a masterful performance, the best I've ever seen him give, as a thoroughly forgettable middle class White Guy facing the same urban pressures many of us (at least here in the good old USA) face daily, and snapping.  After being caught in an L.A. traffic jam with a disfunctional air conditioner he does the thing many of us have thought of doing but somehow never managed to quite do:  He gets out out his car (license plate D-FENS) and walks away.  From there, Douglas' character goes on an orgy of 'doing the things we all have been tempted to do, but somehow don't'.  From trashing a rude, venal convenience store owner's enterprise to offing a homophobic Nazi sympathizer (who makes the mistake of assuming Douglas' character is 'one of us').  Douglas is on a mission and at the point of dispatching (by any means necessary) any and all impediments to that mission.  The mission: to give his little girl a birthday present, ultimately to \\"go home\\" and reestablish his life (somehow) to \\"what it used to be\\" before his ex-wife (understandably) kicked him out.  I won't synopsize the movie any further (except to say that Robert Duvall gives his typical amazing performance, the kind that justifies the art and profession of acting in spite of everybody else out there who call themselves actors), others here have done a fine job at that, so I won't try to repeat them.  I'll just add a reaction that I had that I didn't see in other's reviews.  Somewhere in the middle of the movie I realized that I recognized Douglas' character, that I'd seen this guy somewhere else and couldn't for the life of me quite figure out where.  Now, this character is a pretty unlikely one, a guy whose entire being is focused down to exactly one tiny little, gleaming, diamond hard task that he will let NOTHING interfere with, or evenslow down.  A guy whose goals we tend to sympathize with, but whose methods we can't (quite) bring ourselves to tollerate.  As Daniel Jolley put it in her review above, \\"in a clearly psychotic way, I find this movie somewhat touching,\\" a sentiment apparently shared by almost all the other 'amature reviewers' on Amazon's site (who for the most part did a magnificent job reviewing this movie, by the way).  Touche, Ms. Jolley!  Back to my own point:  After brooding over it for a long time I finally realized where I'd seen this character before; as the hero of almost all of Nikos Kazanzatkas' novels.  In particlar, Douglas' character IS St. Francis of Assisi as portrayed in Kazanzatkas' novel of the same name (published as 'God's Pauper: Saint Francis of Assisi' in England), or, to a somewhat lesser extent, Jesus in 'The Last Temptation of Christ', or Zorba in Kazanzatkas' best known novel.  For anyone who has ever read a Kazanzatkas novel, this should strike a chord.  Kazanzatkas' heros are NEVER 'good guys', their goals are far too big for such trivial classifications to be appropriate, at least in the view of the hero in question, as they are for Douglass' character. They are habitually, and constantly, at odds with society around them, are on missions that (by their lights) are far more important than the few little people who may, regretably, become incidental casualties of their quest.  They are, in a word, psychotic.  I, for one, have found Kazanzatkas' work so magnificently powerful in part because of the way he manages to explore this tension between personal lunacy (his St. Francis would spend his entire life in a straight jacket today) and the quest for higher truths/goals.  Perhaps, if it could have happened, 'Falling Down' would have recieved a far less ambivalent reception oh, say 200 years ago, when people were more used to thinking of the 'big picture', more willing, at least hypothetically, to sacrifice the individual in persuit of the larger truth.  I'm not sure what that reception would have been, but I don't think it would have been ambivalent.  I also believe that the Amazon reviewers of the early 1800's wouldn't mistake this as a movie about 'White Rage', or 'Urban Violence' any more than the story of St. Francis is a story about 'animal rights', or 'The Last Temptation of Christ' is a call for marriage in the priesthood.  Kazanzatkas (and St. Francis, and Jesus, and Douglas' character) had bigger fish to fry.  I won't presume to propose an opinion on the nature of those fish, since that would undermine the entire point of this movie I think, to get YOU to think about the nature of the big fish.  It's had that effect on me at any rate, as a Kazanzatkas novel does. <br />If you've ever read a Kazanzatkas novel (all the way through I mean) then you should own a copy of this movie.  You will look at it periodically, and brood, and think of St. Francis, and big fish, and other psychotics.
B00000099Y|3.0|i think tool fans need to accept that not everyone is gonna go ga-ga for tool.  i've listened to tool and apc they're all right but to me cuz im not a fan it sounds like one long song.  know one can tell me its cuz they're lyrics are to complicated and i have to digest they're songs.  my favorite band is pink floyd(first time i tried to listen to shine on you crazy diamond i thought it sucked now i love it) so i know complicated kick ass lyrics and they really experimented in music like the beatles.  im sure if i listend to this album a couple of times i'd like it cuz i like all types of music, but im pretty sure i'd wouldnt get pissed if someone said they suck.  just cuz ppl dont like tool doesnt make them idiots who only like  stuff like blink 182 and GC.  maybe they were expecting  more like a heavier led zep or pink floyd <br /> <br /> <br />\\"et tu, brute?\\"
B00006LI26|4.0|Twenty years later, and it still becomes more apparent with each listen that this album easily rivaled the best of it's genre - that being early Metallica, Anthrax, etc.  American fans are eternally hung up on the Keepers albums, which in my opinion, have not aged as well as this one, and cannot compare (sorry MK diehards) to the best of the Andi Deris era.

6305313687|2.0|American History X had a ton of potential to be a really great film, with a powerful anti-racism message and a deep look into the heart of white supremacy in America. What it ends up being is a showcase for Ed Norton's BRILLIANT acting and a movie that appeals more to emotion than to logic and reason, an example of Hollywood politicking gone awry.<br /><br />Take the scene at the dinner table for instance, with white supremacist teen Derek Vinyard getting into a debate with his mother's boyfriend, a Jewish teacher played by Eliot Gould. Many of the points Derek makes in this scene, and throughout the movie (once you strip away the racial slurs and Derek's skinhead image) are scarily, devastating LOGICAL, and often factually correct right down to the statistics.<br /><br />This position is never really given any sort of strong debate throughout the movie. Instead, Tony Kaye prefers to equate right-wing/conservative rhetoric with white supremacists, a cheap and logically flawed shot. Norton's character makes clear and rational arguments against affirmative action and the LA riots, but of course since he's the one with swastika tattoos he's not granted one ounce of credibility. We are expected to believe that if one doesn't buy into the Left's viewpoint on race relations they are automatically vile, contemptible racist pigs, capable of beating their own families and killing in cold blood; strawman reasoning at its worst.<br /><br />The movie expects us to connect the dots, rhetoric with acts of violence (ex. Derek gives speech about illegal immigration from Mexico, then along with his cronies attacks a store run by Asian folks). Racism doesn't necessarily lead to violence; it can be (and often is) a more insidious force. Kaye prefers to beat us over the head with melodramatic constant reminders that \\"RACISM IS BAD\\" rather than reach past emotion and present us with a stronger, more considered argument.<br /><br />On top of that, Derek's conversion in prison is way too sudden and poorly thought out to be realistic. No skinhead as adamant as Norton's character will suddenly change his tune after having a good-natured conversation with one black man. If anything, the threat of gang rape by the skinhead prisonmates he was once in league with would force Derek to abandon racism for one utilitarian reason; it failed to protect him from abuse. There is not enough of a moral impetus here to make for Derek's transformation into a Gandhi figure.<br /><br />Still despite all this negative baggage, American History X is not without its powerful moments, as it comes with some of the rawest, most shocking violence in cinema history. The brutal scene where Derek murders two black men after they attempt to steal his truck had me cringing*, as did the other scenes of rape and violence strewn throughout the film. I've seen some pretty gory films, but there are few that have made me this uncomfortable to watch. And the idea that racism is a vicious cycle, as Derek's brother Danny (played by Edward Furlong) inherits his brother's Nazi ideals and his former gang, certainly has merit.

No skinhead as adamant as Norton's character will suddenly change his tune after having a good-natured conversation with one black man. If anything, the threat of gang rape by the skinhead prisonmates he was once in league with would force Derek to abandon racism for one utilitarian reason; it failed to protect him from abuse. There is not enough of a moral impetus here to make for Derek's transformation into a Gandhi figure.     Still despite all this negative baggage, American History X is not without its powerful moments, as it comes with some of the rawest, most shocking violence in cinema history. The brutal scene where Derek murders two black men after they attempt to steal his truck had me cringing*, as did the other scenes of rape and violence strewn throughout the film. I've seen some pretty gory films, but there are few that have made me this uncomfortable to watch.

B0007TKNL0|4.0|I really don't like musicals, so I'm still wondering why I got this DVD (other than the poor selection of movies and the video store).  I watched this movie with a hair trigger finger on the stop button, but I made it through and I'm glad I did. The movie has many hooks, the music and a diverse plot will keep you interested, and almost fascinated that you are enjoying a musical.  The \\"Andrew Lloyd Webber\\" music will seem drab at first, but once you get the hooks, it's like a 80's song that can't get out of your head.  The cinematography is beautiful, it's like watching a weird nightmare on your television, black and white, color, both, I can't stand it any more, this movie is really freaking me out.  Stick with it, there will be times that your attention will wonder, but in the end the movie delivers both a treat for the eye and ear that you will not soon forget.
B00000I8UE|5.0|I am a big fan of Cassandra Wilson's acoustic/folk/blues/jazz hybrid, and this was her first CD I purchased. Cassandra has never been afraid to experiment, adding various influences and touches to her music to set it apart from the regular.<br /><br />It is a tribute to Miles Davis with Cassandra reworking some of his songs, a few originals of hers, and a remake (previously remade by Miles Davis).<br /><br />Cassandra's voice is rich, powerful and deep, and also surprisingly elastic.<br /><br />`Sky and Sea' is as a reviewer put it, simply beautiful! It has to be heard to understand.<br /><br />Most of the album is rather somber; the tender `Some day my prince will come', `Travelling miles', and the remake of Cyndi  Lauper's `Time after time' is so mournful, beautiful and retro, makes  Lauper's version sound like a remake of Cassandra's.<br /><br />Other standouts are `Voodoo reprise' with an African feel to the rhythm and featuring African singer Angelique Kidjo supplying some verses in Yoruba, and the swinging, upbeat, big band style `Seven steps'.<br /><br />Beautifully sung, impeccable musicianship and production. A classy and beautiful addition to any music collection.
B00006JSS8|5.0|There's only thing that I can truly say about this album is that this album is truly a MASTERPIECE!  Worth every penny.  You will enjoy this album from beginning to end.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Awesome!! There are just 8 tracks on this cd but you hardly notice due to the length of the songs, as well as the twists and turns they take (point in case, 'I want you' with it's rock guitar finale).<br /><br />An astonishing album featuring excellent lyrics, vocals and musicianship, every bit as good as her debut `Baduizm'.<br /><br /> Standouts include 'Iwant you', 'Back in the day', 'Love of my life worldwide', 'Bump it', 'The grind', 'Danger', 'Woo', 'Think twice'.. that's the whole cd!<br /><br />Erykah Badu has always been one of my favourite neo Soul singers and I always look forward to a new CD from her with excitement and high expectations which have always been met.<br /><br />Might not be a very commercial cd, but very very good!<br /><br />Did I mention I love the CD cover with some kooky writing somewhere behind her massive 'fro???
B00003CX8V|5.0|Billy Wilder and IAL Daimond have always been known for their cynical touch but The Apartment shows that they had an eye for telling it like it is. <br /> <br />While it was released in 1960, it still applies to corporate America today.  It's not how good you are but the games you play that get you advanced. <br /> <br />Jack Lemmon and Shirley Maclaine became stars from this film.  Jack plays Bud Baxter, an average guy who aspires to more including the hot elevator operator, Miss Kublik (Maclaine). <br /> <br />When Baxter loans his apartment to help out a co worker, company executives quickly jump on the band wagon to host their trysts.  Finally, he makes a deal with the devil (the lecherous head of personnel). <br /> <br />Fred MacMurray played Sheldrake (before he became squeaky clean in a series of Disney films and My Three Sons).  Sheldrake offers Baxter a promotion, for exclusive use of his apartment.  What Baxter doesn't know, is that Sheldrake is seeing Fran Kublik. <br /> <br />All changes on New Years Eve when Sheldrake dumps Fran and she decided to end it all. <br /> <br />Great character actor Jack Kruschen plays the doctor neighbor who thinks all the partying going on in Baxter's apartment is being done by Baxter. <br /> <br />Anyone who works in big business, will still see the similiarity today. <br /> <br />For trivia fans, this is the first Best Picture winner to be converted to a Tony winning Best Musical (Promises, Promises). <br /> <br />And yes Lemmon, Maclaine and Kruchen all received Oscar nominations.
B0000000LI|5.0|Yanni is a genius and this album is his best! Its a compilation from his earlier albums played by Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Acropolis. <br /> <br />Can you go jogging and the blood still rush to your brain? Only when you are listening to Yanni...his music arouses happy emotions. His music has that healing touch! <br /> <br />If you like it, also try his other album \\"If I could tell you\\".
B000002KET|5.0|In the early to mid-1970's, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath were playing a tug of war with the souls of heavy rock fans, a constant case of oneupmanship. Both bands put out album number five in 1973 and whereas Zep had probably a tougher act to follow, the Sabs prevailed on this one. \\"SBS\\" was definitley a step forward for Sabbath as it revealed new complexities in their sound with synthesizers and strings. Did they mellow out? God no! Unless you consider such monoliths as the title track, \\"Killing Yourself to Live\\" \\"A National Acrobat\\" (my personal album fav) and \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\", whimpy. \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" the song could win some arguments as the band's greatest achievement, see the nutty video! Supposedly Iommi felt the need to branch out a little from the doom and gloom as critical response started to become important to him. Whatever his motivations, \\"SBS\\" firmly takes its place in Sabbath's unholy sextet of classic lps. \\"Fluff\\" may be risky dud, but \\"Looking for Today\\" and \\"Spiral Architect\\" succeed with their ambitions. It is ironic that just as the Sabs were trying to distance themselves from supposed \\"demonic\\" influences and produced an album with many upbeat songs, get a load of that album cover!!! Scary!!Both \\"SBS\\" and the film \\"The Exorcist\\" came out around the same time, coincidence? Probably, but who cares. It's the music that matters man and Sabbath continued a historic run, no sign of the burnout that was to come.
B00080ZG10|4.0|It's a long movie. Longer than say, a plane flight from New York to Chicago, and like the TV button on a plane, I had to divert my attention with the 'pause' button every now and then. Howard Hughes is a fascinating character whose legacy as aviation pioneer, Hollywood mogul, and super industrialist, will be sadly overshadowed in history by his overwhelming compulsive disorder, which led to tendacies of schizophrenia. How we laughed at billionaire Hughes in the '70s, believing every dust mite was out to get him, allegedly handing out millions to total strangers, a billionaire crackpot who we liked to believe was merely eccentric. The film reminds us that his psychological troubles were very real and that he became enslaved to them. The Hollywood and military history here is fascinating, the cast is excellent, and while some aviation scenes are heavily pronounced as digitally remastered (Intentional? Do we have Hughes to thank for the digital revolution?), it possesses a cinematic love of aerial camera work. The DVD extra menu is most generous with many segments including a panel discussion with Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese on obsessive compulsive disorder and a History Channel \\"Boys Toys\\" episode on Hughes' contribution to America's technological might.
B000002UJQ|5.0|If you have stumbled to this page, then by all means buy this record. No one comes to Radiohead by happenstance. Much the same way that people become U2heads or Van-atics, Radiohead fans become drawn to the band, no one can force you or convince you of them. If you have an inkling that you may recieve this stuff well, then give it a chance. This is probably not perfect for beginners, the album \\"The Bends\\" would be an easier intro. to Radiohead, then this, followed by the latter works. Also, by all means don't skip to \\"Karma Police\\", you will soon be rewarded for listening from start to finish, preferably with headphones. You'll enjoy this, because you have not been paying attention!
B000002UUX|5.0|Rust in Peace is definitely a \\"buy it\\" cd. Hangar 18 is the best song but God it's close. At the end of Hangar 18 Mustaine and Friedman have a solo battle that just thrashes you. The title track is also very well put together. Tornado of Souls is another great one, mainly because of its lyrics, but the tune is good too. For sound, it's not as smooth as it could be, but it's good enough for me. I would definitely say this is a cd you should buy, one of Megadeth's best works. The end.
0671027344|5.0|I found out about this book when I was 19 and out of high school by a friend, and I was hard pressed to put it down.  The story moves along very well, and at points you can truly see the world through the main character, Charlie's, eyes.  The story is real for many people and it's easy to connect with each character, as we've all met them before, no matter what their name may be. <br /> <br />This is a great book, and definately a beautiful read for anyone still in high school, fresh out of high school, even anyone who has memories of high school.  It's worth picking up, definately.
0066620996|4.0|If you liked Jim Collins' book, \\"Built to Last\\", you will love his follow up called, \\"Good to Great\\". This is one of those rare cases, where the sequel is actually better than the original.  <br />While developing his theory of what makes companies great Collins and his team of researchers reviewed thousands of books, articles, and annual reports; conducted financial analyses on business records. They also interviewed senior executives and board members, scrutinized the personal and professional records of the CEO's. The research team essentially studied every aspect of the business that could be quantified, codified, analyzed, or compared. <br />Collins and his team make some very astute conclusions regarding a business great. These conclusions include moving from good to great starts with leadership, with the will and drive to succeed the leader guides the company's success. Greatness depends on finding the right people to manage and run the business. The company must look at the facts objectively and confront the brutal facts. Great companies discover what they are best at or what they can be the best at and focus all their energy on those activities. Finally the company has to develop a culture of discipline to remain focused on doing things that support success. <br />I enjoyed this book because it is well written.  Collins is able to takes some very complex ideas and explain them in easy to understand terms. All of the conclusions that Collins makes in regards to great companies are supported by research and are intuitively attractive.   <br />The one conclusion that Collins makes that is not supports by any research is that his ideas can be applied to any organization.  While this is a seductive proposition it has no basis in research. When Collins and his team selected the companies they determined as great is was based on these companies stock performance in relationship to comparison companies. By Collins definition of a great company it must be publicly traded.  To think that all of these concepts can be applied to schools or faith-based organizations may be stretching their usefulness. <br />
1565847032|5.0|This is a great book, an ideal entree to Chomsky's thought. Massive respect to the editors for an exemplary job in making these Q & A's unified and gripping. <br /> <br />Completely agree also with the admonishment below of Big Egos who in their faux-sophistication affect to dismiss Chomsky . Noam does seem to bring out the Ass**** in some people, rather like the guy at the bar who decides he doesn't like your face (remember Christopher Hitchens, a former admirer,  taking a swing at Chomsky post 9/11? Sad.). The reviewer who opines that Chomsky is a \\"dilettante and not a serious thinker\\" is either highly satirical or needs gently reminding that Chomsky revolutionised linguistics single-brainedly and is the 9th most quoted person after Jesus, Marx, etc. Get a grip, people, read this guy (or watch the DVDs).
B00097A5I6|4.0|While I'm not the type that would bash the past 2 albums, because I find them to be quite enjoyable, I will say that \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\" is an improvement over the past. The strong points are the improved musicianship and the variety of songwriting styles. Melodically and musically, it's the most interesting thing they've done bar \\"Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants\\". The mixing on this album is great, and it is the most open and organic the band has sounded to date. Liams writing in particular has grown remarkably and he appears to actually be the most versatile of the 4. That said there are a few weak points. For one, the lyrics. Noel needs to stop writing about stars, souls, and more stars shining. It's been the subject of his songs going on 5 years now and always is bound to get into 1 out of every 3 songs he writes. The other weak spot is that you can tell they started to go into a different direction with songs like \\"Mucky Fingers\\", \\"The Importance Of Being Idle\\" and \\"Part Of The Queue\\" and then they kind of take 2 steps backward and put out \\"Lyla\\" and \\"Let There Be Love\\". That's not to take anything away from those 2 songs (although they tend to be the most clichd on the album). Rather, we've had 6 albums (plus b-sides) worth of those types of songs, what's wrong with abandoning that sound already? All in all, great album, step in the right direction. If nothing else it gives you a glimmer of what Oasis could become if they really want to. Here's hoping the next album doesn't take 3 years.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|I love movies that no nobody survive in them! except bad people! I'm seek of watching a hero or a victim survive each time! If you think like me, this is your movie! Everyone would die and psychophat would live! this is not a scary movie, It's a bloody movie! It got me revived, the only better movie I've ever seen is \\"The Texas Chinsaw Massacre (2004)\\"
B0000640VO|5.0|Ok, i'm usually not one to like movies that are described as \\"cute\\" or anything of the sort, I tend to stick to the darker side of film. But in this case, this movie was recommended to me by a couple of people who I deem to have good taste in film and thought to myself \\"what the hell\\". It really took me off guard how much I liked this movie, heartwarming/charming would definately describe the plot. What really got me was the FANTASTIC directing from the director who also made \\"City of Lost Children\\"(Can't remember his name right now...French...that's all I know), I mean it was just incredibly well done. Also a couple parts made me laugh out loud, which is always a nice suprise from a movie where you weren't expecting it. Oh, and heres a thing that struck me as being funny...the whole \\"traveling gnome\\" thing, it seems as if that's where Travelocity got their ideas for their new commercials...ha...copyright...infringement...unless they sold them the idea...anyways, great movie and highly recommended for fans of \\"feel good cinema\\" and fans of great directing/cinemotography. My rating: 9.5/10.
B00006JDU9|4.0|This movie was ok, not what I expected, but I have watched it still quite a few times and own it.  This is one of those movies that is more worth watching on vhs/dvd then the movie theater.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Sounds more like a rhetorical question to me...<br /><br />An energy driven experimental post-hardcore/alternative gem of an album that brings the sweet sting of nostalgia to my nostrils. I love this album and band, enough said.
B0000931OG|3.0|As the obscure scene of two embracing people with diving helmets on the cover might indicate, this C.D. is rather interesting. Think Tank's musical themes include calm ballads, noisy yet likeable hard rock, and blends of peppy lyrics with complex electronic rhythms. By this point in time, Blur's main singer seems to have slightly reduced his British accent, and hardly even sounds like he did in Blur's 1994 album \\"Parklife\\". This factor creates a bit of a different feel for the C.D. One of the more outstanding tunes on Think Tank is \\"Crazy Beat\\", which is understandably a projected hit. This song has what seems to be a computerized duck voice, loud guitars, and energetic singing mixed together. Although I'm not a huge fan of this C.D., I would recommend it to modern rock lovers and/or faithful Blur fans. <br />I recommend: <br />Ambulance <br />Crazy Beat <br />Brothers & Sisters <br />We've Got A File On You <br />Moroccan Peoples' Revolutionary Bowls Club <br />
B00003CXCT|2.0|Look is anyone really gonna care about continuity? We KNOW the originals were made in the 70s/80s, to put Hayden in ROTJ is pathetic! Because we know it's an add-on it takes so much from the realism of the film. <br />The ewoks in the original were singing such a cute song! and the scene felt so intimate because we didn't see how the rest of the galaxy were celebrating- it was our heroes celebrating in a quiet, intimate place! <br />Ugh I despise my new purchase! I can't believe I have to buy another bundle of DVDs when the originals come out.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I was originally introduced to this group when I heard their superb single \\"Clint Eastwood\\" on a different C.D. featuring various hits of the era, and later found that this C.D. of theirs had some really neat music. Sampling, vocals, and music in general are all very well manipulated and entertaining, and each song pretty much has no similarity to the others. This album has a wide variety of tune styles, including instrumentals with incredibly low-tuned guitars, brief hard rock sessions, rhythmically top-notch rap, upbeat remixes and much more. One of the songs that I recommend most on this album is \\"Clint Eastwood\\", which actually does not discuss its title at all but rather wields a series of piano backgrounds with a well-flowing rap dialogue that is easy to enjoy again and again. Another is \\"Left Hand Suzuki Method\\", which features an intriguing blend of an opera singer, vigorous bass, honky-tonk piano, and old violin music that combines to form a catchy melody. This is perhaps my favorite C.D. that I possess, and I would recommend it to rap fans for songs #5 and #10, plus to admirers of all music genres since the C.D. has such a wide variety. <br />I recommend: <br />Re-Hash <br />5/4 <br />Clint Eastwood <br />Punk <br />Sound Check <br />Double Bass <br />19-2000 <br />M1A1 <br />Left Hand Suzuki Method <br />
B0009MDPYM|4.0|Okay, this is for all the fanboys out there:  other than 'Sin City', there is never going to be a comic book movie that will be exactly like the comic book.  It just won't happen.  It gets annoying hearing \\"But in the comic it went like this...\\" over and over again.  Get over it already.  Now, on to the movie...<br /><br />I went into 'Constantine' not expecting a whole lot.  I really don't like Keanu Reeves very much.  I think of him as basically an mannequin who can talk but he's actually fine here as the lead.  But I thought the premise of the film(yes fanboys, based on the comic 'Hellblazer')sounded interesting.  After watching the film, I was pleasantly surprised with it.  There was plenty of stylish action scenes that are very well done.  But the reason to see 'Constantine' is for the special effects.  They are absolutely amazing, some of the best I think I've ever seen, especially the shootout near the end of the film.  They are seamless.  As for the rest of the film: none of the acting was really that great nor was it terrible, but this is a comic book movie so I wasn't really expecting it to be Oscar caliber.  They do a workman-like job and don't drag the movie down at all.  And the script is pretty well done.  There's no real slow points and there's not any cheesy dialogue, which seems to plague comic book adaptions.<br /><br />Overall, 'Constantine' has an interesting little religious plot, good action scenes, some comic relief, and super-fabulous special effects.  This film is not cerebral in any sense of the word, but it is a fun, mindless way to spend a couple hours.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I thought Absolution was a lot better than some of Muse's previous work, mainly because they seemed to have acquired a wiser sense of rock. As is typical of Muse, all of the songs discuss interesting topics and have an overall mystic theme. Singer Matt Bellamy does quite well on the vocals, and gives a good touch to the band when singing with soft or hard rock backgrounds. Although the basic progressions of the music are fairly simple for most of the tracks, the expertly chosen combination of instruments and sounds create very enjoyable music for the listener. One of the songs that I favor most on this C.D. is \\"Hysteria\\", which was probably the most popular projected hit off the album. Hysteria has an almost eerie sense about it at times, with guitars that seem to howl as if a ghoul, fuzzy-sounding progressions, and seemingly triumphant vocals. I would recommend Absolution to all fans of hard rock, ballad-style rock, and of the band in general. <br />I recommend: <br />Apocalypse Please <br />Time is Running Out <br />Stockholm Syndrome <br />Hysteria <br />Blackout <br />Butterflies & Hurricanes <br />The Small Print <br />Thoughts of a Dying Atheist <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|By Abbey Road, the Beatles and George Martin were experts on studio recording. Paul McCartney's wish to make it a pop music medley won over John Lennon's aim to make the Beatles a hard rock/blues band like Led Zeppelin, and the final four songs were written by McCartney. The first half has a few classic songs like &#34;Come Together&#34; and &#34;Something&#34;, but the focus of the album is the medley starting with &#34;Because&#34;.<br /><br />The medley features some of the best Beatles songwriting and playing, and this sequence includes some great vocal harmonies that remind me of their early songs. (You would never guess by listening to it that they were about to breakup the group.) McCartney maybe was inspired by the Moody Blues' Days of Future Passed (1967) and the newly-formed prog groups like King Crimson. Abbey Road has a timeless sound that compares favorably to the album rock of the 70's and beyond.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Ok, so this a controversial dvd set. Lots of people love it, many people want the original movies on DVD. This is my opinion after seeing Revenge of the Sith. Some of the changes made are very nice, others kinda unnecassary. The changes made in Jabba's appearence are nice. He now appears as he did in The Phantom Menace giving a bit more consistancy to the sage. Lightsaber blades look better than ever, especially in A New Hope, Obi-Wan and Luke's sabers are a brilliant blue throughout, not appearing white at points like in the originals. I honest to God dont care if Greedo fires his gun first. It shows Han can stay calm and blast his enemies even when a blast hits inches away from his head. This is a two second scene that to me has no real impact on the saga. A couple other minor tweaks have been made, in the Death Star, words on a control panel no longer read POWER and TRACTOR BEAM, but instead have been changed to some Star Wars dialect, not English for sure, this is acceptable. Ian McDiarmid has replaced the old actor in Empire with slightly altered dialog informing Vader of Luke's true identity, I really like this change. The Jedi Temple and the Senate can be seen on Coruscant in the ending of Jedi and even though it is reletively short, the addition of Naboo to the ending of Jedi is one of my favorite scenes, for continuity purposes. THe addition of Hayden Christinsen is also a favorite of mine, I thought he did a great job in Sith and think he deserves his appearence. Obi-Wan and Yoda both appear as they did when the died, Anakin should too. Because essentially, Anakin died when he became Darth Vader, as Obi Wan says in A New Hope. I am a fan of both the Original trilogy and the Prequel trilogy. I believe the changes made are overall good for the movie's continuity and its fun to see some new stuff, as well as the old stuff digitally remastered, again. The dvd's truely look and sound fantastic. Honestly, I do wish Lucas would release the originals unmodified onDVD so everyone could be happy, but I've got my 1995 VHS tapes still, so I'm holding out fine. I love theses new versions much more personally. Check them out for sure along with Episode I and II on DVD, those are great as well. Revenge of the Sith is slated for DVD release on November 8th, can't wait! Thanks for reading
B000002UAO|4.0|I used to listen to only about 10 albums when I was in college (student budget), and this was one of them. This album is great for those cold fall days when you're studying for an exam wearing an old knit sweater. Okay, maybe that doesn't happen, but there's several Beatles classics here like \\"Norwegian Wood\\", \\"In My Life\\", and \\"Girl\\". It's their most \\"folk\\" album, and classic mid-60s.<br /><br />(And a few other college essentials: Bach-Brandenburg Concertos (on period instruments), Vivaldi -Four Seasons, Herbie Hancock - Maiden Voyage.)
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|After 4 long years, SOAD finally deliver the followup to Toxicity, which in my humble opinion ranks as the greatest album of this decade thus far and one of the top metal CDs of all time (perhaps behind only Master Of Puppets).  So that's where I'm coming from.    First, like evryone has mentioned, 38 minutes is a little short.  I'll take 38 minutes over 79 bloated minutes of half baked nonsense, but it seems like 15 songs and 45 minutes would be a bit more fair.  Especially since some of these songs feel like throw-offs (really, do you think in a year anyone is still going to dig Old School Hollywood?).  The songs that were less serious on Toxicity (say, Bounce or Shimmy) were still musically great and fit in nicely, whereas here you wonder where \\"Don't Eat The Fish\\" fits in to with the grand scheme of the album.    Everyone also has an opinion on is the lyrics.  SOAD are obviously a leftist band, which is another great rock n roll cliche, but that's fine.  The lyrics here are a slight cut above the empty sloganeering of some of the Steal This Album tracks (\\"F- You Pig!\\", \\"F- The System\\", and my favorite \\"We Don't Give A F- About Your War\\", written at a time when there were precisely zero wars occurring that the US was involved in.  You know F- Bomb + USA Sucks = Genuine Rebel - and this is coming from a pretty left-leaning dude by the way).  Luckily here they get away from those sort of Rage Against The Machine-isms and ratchet it up...slightly.    Lastly, as has been mentioned in other reviews, Daron is turning into quite the mic hog (reminds me of Ken Casey from Dropkick Murphys - \\"Hey, if I'm writing all the songs and am capable of carrying a tune then I'm going to sing and if anyone doesn't like it they can quit 'my' band\\").  I have no problem with Daron's vocals, but multitracking all of his own vocal harmonies on Lost In Hollywood is just plain dumb - c'mon, are you too good to harmonize with Serj?    Anyway, all that being said there are some GREAT songs here, namely Cigaro (along with BYOB, the heaviest song on the album), Sad Statute, and probably my favorite, Radio/Video.  If this were put out by some new unknown band it'd get 5 stars, but SOAD have set the bar too high for themselves.  That being said, it's better than 99% of what's on the radio now and any rock fan should pick it up (quick aside - anyone else think Sum 41, whose \\"Does This Look Infected\\" CD comes highly recommended by the way, ripped off \\"Chop Suey\\" for \\"We're All To Blame\\"?).  Anyyway, rest assured I'll buy Hypnotize the day it's released too.
B000002UAX|5.0|The White Album is a classic smorgasbord of music. Most Beatles albums had about 5 great songs, but White Album has over 20 including \\"Dear Prudence\\", \\"Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Helter Skelter\\", and \\"Revolution\\"(acoustic version). The songwriting is great, but what really makes this album is the musicianship on songs like \\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey\\".  Rested and refueled by their 1968 trip to India, the Beatles returned to England to record by far their most experimental and varied album.<br /><br />The only flaws are the two pedestrian rockers that begin each side, \\"Back in the USSR\\" and \\"Birthday\\", \\"Don't Pass Me By\\", and \\"Martha My Dear\\" (only Martha Stewart could like this one). \\"Revolution 9\\", almost 9 minutes of sound effects, is avant-garde progressive \\"music\\" similar to some Roger Waters and Ron Geesin, very experimental.<br /><br />Also, this is the best Beatles album in terms of sound quality. Either studio recording took a great leap forward in 1968, or EMI is issuing substandard recordings of the earlier Beatles albums.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System of a Down, having not released an actual album for four years could have just released crap and everyone would glamorize it because \\"Hey, it's a new SOAD album!\\".  But they didn't.  They released an incredibly stout album with some wonderful tracks (not one bad one in my opinion) <br /> <br />As always, SOAD puts some beautifully crafted political commentary into their music.  And to whoever put that System of a Down doesn't know what their talking about???  F*** off and learn something before you post it.  \\"Why do they always send the poor?\\" is an accurate statement.  During a draft (Like Vietnam say...) the Rich can literally \\"buy\\" their way out of War.  GWB did it, Dick Cheney did it.  So did a majority of politicians nowadays.  If you are rich or your daddy knows somebody then you don't have to join the army.  So pull your head out of your ass. <br /> <br />As I was saying.  Lyrically, Mezmerize is among System's best.  They are a little less crafty than on Toxicity, and the Album doesn't really have that conjoined feeling like Toxicity did, but none-the-less the lyric's are completely amazing.  They combine a blend of the subliminal and the obvious.  Something I haven't seen done so well since Cobain. <br /> <br />Musically, Mezmerize has the best work from all of their albums.  From the layered guitar work to the exceptional dual vocalizing, SOAD delivers on every level.  The drumming isn't as unique as on Toxicity, though still amazingly talented.  Overall, some of the most technical work SOAD has done. <br /> <br />As others have said, the only thing lacking is the length.  But this is to be understood with a second disc coming out soon.  And I personally think that this disc is just the beginning of what is to come.  I think they are going to blow us away with Hypnotize.  On the whole, Mezmerize is worthy of SOAD's reputation and abilities.  Well done, well done.
B00005A46T|5.0|OK, I find you unintelligent for stereotyping that Slipknot fans are dumb. Have you met every one of them? Have you ever stopped to think that they might possibly listen to OTHER bands than Slipknot? Apparently not, you dumb piece of s***. I listen to Cryptopsy, as well as Vital Remains, Kataklysm, Opeth, Nile, Suffocation, I could go on forever. And no, Joey is NOT horrible, but definitely not the best. I have been a maggot for years, and I will be the first to admit that Slipknot are not the best, but definitely not the worst, as you make them out to be. I'm sure you exagerated some in your review to try and get some points across, but you still come off as a worthless loser who has nothing better to do in life than rag on a band because thousands of others do. If I were you, I wouldn't go making comments such as the ones you made, because you too come off as unintelligent.
0143034901|1.0|I hated this novel. I kept reading, not knowing why, except perhaps I was trying to convince myself that no book could be this bad. Well, this one is. The plot is a winding, painful road filled with cliches, predictable situations, and purple metaphors that are painful to read.<br /><br />The characters are pure stereotypes, flat and static. Perhaps the depth was lost in translation, but somehow I doubt it. I cannot for the life of me understand what people see in this book. I, for one, finished it irritated and ready to read anything, and I mean anything, else.
B00005CDNJ|2.0|This album has some pretty good songs, but when I said some I mean four - six and that's not even the half of album's 12 songs. But that's not the big problem. All the bad songs is in the end of the album and all the good one in the begining. That's why I don't like it so much.  <br /> <br />
B00097A5I6|3.0|As an Oasis fan from way back, I eagerly anticipated this new album, especially after hearing \\"Lyla\\", which is, hands-down, a great song. Well, the rest of the CD leaves much to be desired, I am sorry to say. Another reviewer summed it up rather well when he said that they peaked in '95-'96; that sadly seems to be the case. \\"Part of the Queue\\" is also good, but other than that, I wasn't too impressed. A major flaw of the new CD is that it sounds and feels derivative, and often Beatles-esque. I don't like the Beatles and want to hear Oasis sounding like Oasis, not trying to sound like The Beatles. Anyway, there's always hope that their next CD will be better. By the way, if you're looking to buy a great rock CD, check out The Wallflowers' new one, \\"Rebel, Sweetheart\\". It rocks, and does not disappoint!
B000057NVH|4.0|One thing about having the CD of Mike Oldfield's \\"Tubular Bells\\" is that you end up listening to \\"Part Two\\" a lot more often than you ever did when this was a record. I never really thought of this album as having two parts, because they really do not fit together the same way as, say, Jethro Tull's \\"Thick As a Brick\\" or \\"A Passion Play.\\"  I think that most people who remember the radio play edit or the use of the theme in \\"The Exorcist\\" are impressed when they hear all of \\"Part One,\\" where Oldfield adds instrument after instrument to a simple theme until it climaxes with the titular Tubular Bells. There is a sense in which the final section of \\"Part One\\" is sort of the Seventies version of Ravel's \\"Bolero.\\"  It is the same thing over and over again, but it still grows on you.  It is even fun to hear someone naming all of the instruments that Oldfield is playing.  He does not play every instrument on the album, just organ, Hammond organ, Farfisa organ, piano, grand piano, honky tonk piano, keyboards, guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, fuzz guitar, Spanish guitar, Mando-guitar, bass guitar, bass, mandolin, bagpipes, flageolet, glockenspiel, timpani, and tubular bells (I might have missed some).<br /><br />However, on \\"Part Two,\\" by the time we get to the \\"Sailor's Hornpipe\\" bit, you are ready to flip the record over, um, I mean, click on the magic button, and hear \\"Part One\\" again, especially the part with the Nasal Choir.  This is one of those cases where you get a rating of 4 stars by splitting the difference between the 5 stars for \\"Part One\\" and the 3 stars for \\"Part Two.\\"  This album has the distinction of being the first released on Virgin Records, started by Richard Branson when Oldfield could not get any existing label to pick up the album.  \\"Tubular Bells\\" made it to #3 on the Billboard album charts and won a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition (other than Jazz).

B00005B36H|5.0|After listening to the band since their beginnings I say they really developed into a consistant hit-machine. Not that they have gone pop but the music sticks inside your head.They seem to have shed off some of the old influences for prog bands such as King Crimson, and Yes. The opening figure a 5/8 groove with a ascending 3rd motive where each note enters on beat 4 of the groove when finished its statement creates a overall feeling of 4/4. They are a band where the music is built of layers of ideas. Harmonically the are not as adventrous as they are rhythmically; still dealing with the consistant harmonic language almost all heavy bands use. With all that aside the music which is most important sounds great, though I cannot help get the feeling that they have been listening to Tortise an awful lot(not that thats bad). Great music! long live Tool (or until they suck)
6304288433|4.0|This  Is  the  1981  follow  -  up  to  the  1978  original  classic .  John  Carpenter  Co  -  writes  ,  Co  -  produces  but  doesn't  direct .  This  film  could  have  been  a  little  better  if  Carpenter  did  decide  to  direct  it .  There  were  rumors  that  Carpenter  did  direct  a  few  scenes  but  Carpeneter  has  regularly  denied  the  rumors .  Rick  Rosenthal  takes  over  the  reigns  for  this  polished  sequel.  this  film  begins  exactly  where  the  original  ended .  (  Jamie  Lee  Curtis  )  returns  as  Laurie  and  she  is  rushed  to  the  nearby  local  hospital  for  treatment  on  her  wounds  from  the  attack .  (  Donald  Pleasence  )  is  back  as  the  psychiatrist  of  the  deranged  killer .  (  Dick  Warlock  )  plays  Michael  Myers .  Warlock  stalks  Curtis  at  the  small  hosptal  which  is  only  occupied  by  one  security  guard  ,  one  doctor  ,  a  few  nurses  including  (  Tawny  Moyer  )  as  Nurse  Jill  ,  (  Pamela  Susan  Shoop  )  as  Nurse  Karen  and  (  Ana  Alicia  )  as  Nurse  Janet .  There  are  also  a  couple  of  ambulace  workers  (  Leo  Rosi  )  as  Bud  and  (  Lance  Guest  )  as  Jimmy .  Warlock's  first  victim  is  actually  a  teenage  girl  who  lived  close  by  to  the  house  where  Michael  Myers  terrorized  Curtis . The  atmosphere  of  the  film  is  very  spooky  with  Warlock  roaming  the  halls  of  the  nearly  empty  hospital .  Warlock  then  elimenates  the  security  guard .  Then  Pamela  Susan  Shoop  is  drowned  in  the  famous  hot  tub  scene  which  was  rumored  to  have  been  directed  by  John  Carpenter .  Ana  Alicia  is  visciously  murdered  by  Warlock  who  is  hiding  in  a  doctor's  office  where  Alicia  is  searching  for  the  only  doctor  available .  Tawny  Moyer  is  killed  in  another  famous  scsene  when  she  is  lifted  up  off  the  ground  by  Warlock  who  stabs  her  in  the  back  with  a  scalpel  and  lifts  her  up  with  onlyone  hand .  The  suspense  really  picks  up  when  Warlock  and  Curtis  meet  up  towards  the  end  of  film .  Warlock  gives  a  standout  performance  ,  his  slow  creepy   walk  through  the  hospital  is  memorable .  And  the  song  \\"Mr.  Sandman\\"  sung  by  \\"The  Chordettes\\"  at  both  the  start  and  end  of  the  film   does  fit  very  well  here  !  \\"Halloween  II\\"  is  not  as  good  as  the  original  but  how  many  sequels  ever  are  ?  \\"Halloween  II\\"  is  good  and  it's  the  only  sequel  that's  worth  watching  at  all  !!
B000000P17|4.0|It seems like everybody in the world hates this album, and I don't know why. Greatness is in the ear of the listener I suppose, but I like this album very much. Their version of \\"Hair of The Dog\\" turned me onto Nazareth. You certainly can't knock the songs (if you do then you probably don't like or understand Rock n' Roll period), and I think this is a fine and enthusiastic tribute to the music that inspired GN'R, and I can honestly find no fault with it. <br /> <br />And to whoever said GN'R were an average band, I just wanna say where do you hang around? Seriously, I wanna know, because if the average bands in your neck of the woods are as vital and incendiary as GN'R, then I think I want to move there!
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|This was a disappointing film. I did look forward to it so very much. The first few images I saw seemed great. And, true enough, there are some stunning visuals in it. It's for the visual imagery and quality fight scenes that I give this three stars. But I couldn't get beyond the poor writing and the complete disregard for the source material. I know that film adaptions should have their own life. This film didn't need to be the Iliad on the screen. But on the other hand it's frustrating when they take a great story, great drama, classic characters and plot... And then make something so flat and lame. If you really don't know the Iliad you'll probably be a lot happier with this. But I remember it quite well, and I just watched this in awe at all the changes they made and how poorly it effected the finished product. <br /> <br />I keep wanting to see more ancient epics on the screen. I'd love to see GATES OF FIRE or PRIDE OF CARTHAGE in big, fabulous versions, maybe brought to life on the scale of RETURN OF THE KING. But Hollywood seems incapable of making really good historical epics. I guess they cost so much money that they have to make decisions geared at profit instead of quality. But that hasn't work for films like ALEXANDER and KING ARTHUR and TROY. TROY might have made a profit worldwide, but it wasn't exactly the blockbuster the studio wanted. That's clear. <br /> <br />And how about having an actual Greek actor in a Greek-themed movie once in a while? I for one would love to watch a movie where the actors looked authentic to the ethnicity they're trying to portray. It's an unfortunate aspect of our race-biased world that we cast Brad Pitt as Achilles, Russell Crowe as the Gladiator, Colin Farrell as Alexander. It's shameless. Wouldn't it be great to discover some unknown Greek actor who could really inhabit these characters? And when did we decide that Greeks and Romans generally spoke with a British accent? There are so many Brits in this film that it musthave kept most of the Britain's male character actors in work. <br /> <br />It's unfortunate that Hollywood can't let the past live as the past and make something really interesting. Nobody else can do it, really. There are some Japanese, Chinese and Korean epics that have been wonderful, but these filmakers are usually working on their own material/history. That's too bad. How about somebody gets Ang Lee to direct Hannibal's story? That might be something, but I won't hold my breath. I'll just keep reading the books and hoping, hoping for a film to live up with them.
B00004W52U|5.0|so maybe this isnt THE best skunk cd (i think keasbey nights is) but this is still one of the best skunk cds. ATLEAST top 10. <br />i didnt get this version of energy, i got the (better)one that also includes their EPs. <br />so if you're going to buy a version of this cd, buy the one i bought. the only differemce is like 6 songs but those extra songs are just as good as these. <br />so i'm not gonna go in depth with how awesome OP IV was/is but my 2 favorite songs of theirs are- \\"sound system\\" and \\"yelling in my ear\\" <br />listen to OP IV!!!
B000063COX|4.0|This for sure is a excellent debut album, we all know that paul di anno is not bruce dickinson but he still managed to do an excellent job and i really loved his tone of voice who i think fit excellent with the band at this moment in time. They were all melodie and raw. The highlits of the album are in my opinion remember tomorrow(great change of styles in one song), phantom of the opera(killer track, i think the best in the album), sanctuary(kool song), the all classical running free and prowler(great way to start a killer album). It is good to know that this guys where making great music even from their roots. This is a must have for any real iron maiden fan.
B000002ADT|5.0|This simply put is the one of the best most influential jazz albums ever made.  Miles Davis, Coltrane, and Adderly on the same album is any purists perfect lineup.  Any fan of jazz must have this album.  The extra take of \\"Flamenco Sketches\\" is a major bonus.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril shows people how to kill music in three steps.  1. Claim to be punk, even though emo kids are more punk than you  2. Write music that claims to be punk, but is pure pop  3. Sell your soul by being played on MTV  So there, that shows how Avril Lavigne killed music. If anyone comes up to me and says she is punk, I'd call them an MTV poser.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|Is Slane the greatest concert film ever?  Though this is for you and you alone to decide you'll be able to tell two minutes into the show when John Frusciante literally rips the Irish air into shreds. In the concert intro, Frusciante pulls some of the most awesome notes known to man from the strings of his electric guitar.  It is absolutely unreal to watch and listen to what he can do with that guitar, as he takes his trademark sound to new heights and defines guitar heroics for you right in your own home.  From here on in you know that you're in for a special treat.  The Peppers display that even dudes well into their 40's are still capable of creating majik on stage on par with what they do in the studio.  By the Way, which I've never found to be a strong track, gets a new lease on life in Slane as tens of thousands of Irish fans sing along to it.  The segue into Scar Tissue is audio ecstasy, as the band pulls together into a jam based on the song's melody with Frusciante's guitar creating soulful sounds best described as epic.  He harmonizes beautifully with Anthony on the aforementioned greatest comeback song of all time.  Another song that I never liked on record that is given the royal makeover here is Throw Away Your Television.  To my delight I discovered that is actually a great song, augmented by the passionate playing the guys put into it for Slane.  I love the tricked out guitar effects, which sound like they were made by a synthesizer and I love the guitar solo that ends the song.   I could go on and on and write capsule reviews for each and every song performed on this DVD, but that would take up the entire page.  Let's put it this way: Anthony rarely sounds this good on record, Frusciante hasn't played guitar like this since he was eighteen, Chad absolutely wails on the drums, and Flea has taken a necessary supporting role, which only strengthens the band's new, melody-driven sound.  All of the band's greatest \\"new\\" songs are here, including perenialfavorite, the Zephyr Song and of course, Under the Bridge.  The 50's ditty John sings after Scar Tissue and the Fugazi homage are two of the many highlights.  I won't lie, I'm a monsterous John Frusciante fan.  To the person who said he can't play guitar, please go back and give this dvd another go.  If this isn't rock guitar playing at it's finest and most identifiable then I haven't been listening to rock for the past 23 years.   This is essential.
B00097A5I6|4.0|Long time Oasis followers hoping in vain for the return of the days of \\"Definitely Maybe\\" and \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\" may at first be turned off, even shocked by the humble subtlety of \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" but this is a recording worth sticking with. Indeed only the opener, the too-short \\"Turn Up the Sun\\" is the only true rocker- a song that the old Oasis would have kept going for 7 minutes is now stopped dead in its tracks by a band that might be rethinking its own self-perceived greatness.  <br /> <br />Perhaps this is a new Oasis, the clichd older and wiser version. The good news is the songwriting is strong, and in many ways, this may be the bands darkest CD, as evidenced by the alienation of \\"Part of the Queue\\", the repentance of \\"God Thinks I'm Abel\\" and the revengeful \\"Mucky Fingers\\".  There's not one throwaway here, (OK \\"Let There Be Love\\" is a bit silly, but you can't help singing along with it after a while) and even has some tunes that rank with the bands best, including the sweet \\"Love Like a Bomb\\".  <br /> <br />Oasis fans, not all is lost. Some of the lyrics here are marked by Oasis trademark arrogance such as the best track on the CD, \\"Keep the Dream Alive\\" with a truly uplifting chorus; and you all will be happy to learn that Liam Gallagher's ultra-cool snarl is better than ever.  <br /> <br />Critics who delight in the continued artistic and commercial failures of the villainous Brothers Gallagher seem to point out with gleeful wordplay on the title that \\"Truth\\" is not Oasis' \\"comeback\\" album; but if this is the bands new direction, who cares? Let's hope this streak of humility continues for a long time to come. <br />
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Before sitting down to watch NBC's broadcast of the show I was a bit apprehensive.  Having flown out to Colorado to see Crosby, Stills and Nash this past summer and being completely disappointed and disillusioned I was hoping for the best in seeing another of my all time favorites.  I didn't want to have my bubble bursted again by seeing a similar disappointing show of out of key vocals and forgotten lyrics. <br /> <br />Believe me when I say  I was not disappointed, as a matter of fact it was one of the best shows I've seen in years.  Having seen the Eagles 3 times in their hay day and owning all of their albums thats right albums not cd's, it was like a refreshing journey back to my youth. <br /> <br />The harmonies were studio quality, the bridges were right on and the riffs and timing of the songs were exactly as I remembered them.  From Frey and Henley's strong vocals to Walsh's picture perfect licks this is truly one of the all time great performances. You can't help but sing along with every song and let yourself drift back in time. <br /> <br />Two thumbs up!!! A must for any rock music efficianado's collection.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|this movie is hardly a masterpiece. Please don't preach about the directing in this movie, it doesn't take a genius to build up suspense with such a blantantly obvious plot. How could things not go wrong with a group of people all getting mixed up with drugs. This is like a childrens book mixed up with Shakespeare. The only reason it is so popular is because anyone including my 4 year old nephew can piece together the symbolism and themes of this movie. This movie reminds me of Romeo and Juliet, although a thousand times better than this movie, because it is so widely read and hailed only because it is the easiest Shakespeare to identify with and analyze. I feel bad even comparing Romeo and Juliet to this horrible movie because it has that much more meaning and storyline to it than RFAD. Only buy this movie if you are interessted in learning about the falsified drug world pictured here or you want to scare people into not doing drugs.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|Led Zeppelin fans rued the day John Bonham died, leaving no more foot to drive the Jimmy Page/Plant engine of rock and roll. Many thought, as I did, that the sound of the band derived from the licks and riffs that Page and J.P. Jones drew up from their reservoir of black delta blues players. Imagine our surprise upon hearing Robert Plant's first solo album filled with the sounds of Led. Indeed, as it turned out, the creative genesis behind Led Zeppelin may well have been the sultry lead singer, his Mona Lisa smile hiding decades of ideas and alternate musical realities.<br /><br />Mighty Rearranger has played the day through, ever since I unwrapped it from its Amazon box. The ethereal otherworldliness entering my happy ears is what I hope music will be in another 20 years or so. I picture this music being played someday on another planet. Of course, Robert, a svelte octogenarian by then, will be writing music influenced by travels through some other galaxy.<br /><br />Continuing Plant's recent dive into Eastern flavors, the set salutes many of his past influences, especially with the acoustic \\"All the Kings Horses\\" and the more gut-rocking \\"Tin Pan Valley.\\" But mostly, it's deliciously different, yet familiar. Lyrically, it's no Willie Dixon, but the hooks hook, the harmonies and melodies surprise, the rhymes rhyme, and the few lyrics included don't quite match what he sings, which is as it should be.<br /><br />When I first listened to clips of the songs, I thought they sounded a little alike, and that would have been a bad thing. I needn't have worried. Yes, the style flows throughout, but the rhythms, beats, melodies, and layerings (ah the layers and production!) provide a foot-tapping, head-shaking, body-swaying journey for ear and mind.<br /><br />\\"Wash me the blue twin and send her and the wookie woman to my ship.\\"
B00005JMAH|1.0|I am greatly dissapointed. The only time I would even consider recommending this movie to any one would be at a garage sale. I am a huge fan of the books and the 2 previous movies. The real essence of the books were brought to life in the &quot;old&quot; movies, i loved them...<BR>   The Prisoner of Azkaban movie contained the plot and the right scenes, it had a &quot;better&quot; womping willow, and you could see Hogwarts students in modern day muggle clothing,but thats not what I wanted to see. The soul, the magic, where was it?
B000002UD7|5.0|I was so into this album when I was a kid. Everywhere i went I feel like heres a glimpse of Pet Shop Boys music in the air. This is longe before came the depressed period of 90s music such as Grunge, Alternative and all. This music makes me happy. I still love Rent, Shopping, heart and King's Cross tho.
B000002G7G|5.0|I bought the original vinyl when it came out and have been listening to it ever since.  I had no idea until I bought the box set that the \\"closet mix\\" (which is the vinyl mix I have) is rare.  That said, and noting that in any mix this is a great album, there are pros and cons.  IMO, the rockers, like Beginning to See the Light and What Goes On, sound better in this mix (sorry, Lou).  However, some songs are better in the closet mix, which is apparently now available only on the box set Peel Slowly and See.  The most glaring change is Some Kind of Love where they actually used a different take!  The closet mix is far superior, IMO.  See, what happened is that after they laid down the tracks, Lou took the master tape and re-mixed it, bringing the vocals far to the front and keeping the instruments way in the background.  This was the original release.  I don't know when the ehgineer got a hold of it and made more \\"commercial mixes\\" (yeah, right), but that is what is available on CD unless you buy the box set.  You won't do badly.  Even someone like me, who is both a purist and a fan who has been listening to the \\"closet mix\\" for almost forty years, can appreciate it.  But you owe it to yourself to find a way to hear the alternate mix and decide for yourself.
B00000JLWW|5.0|This was a lovely, well acted movie.  I could go on and on about it, but first I would like to addres the issues that some people have with this movie(and one warning) <br /> <br />a.  People are complaining about how this movie did not have as much historical basis as it should have, how it was just a love story, etc. <br /> <br />Well, People must remeber that this is a MOVIE, not a DOCUMENTARY.  It's motive is to entertain, which is were the love story comes in.  One cannot look to it for fact alone.  This is just a movie, so stop over analizying it for goodness sake! <br /> <br />b.  People are complaining about the length. <br /> <br />Hello!!! This movie is so CAPTIVATING that lenght is not a promblem whatsoever!  If you sit down and really enjoy this film, the 3 hours will seem more like 3 min. <br /> <br />c.  People (okay, my parents) are complaining about the neverending Celion Deon (SP please?) song. <br /> <br />She has such a gorgeous voice-and the song was breath-taking.  I loved it.  It really adds an uplifting  feeling to the film. <br /> <br />d.  People are complaining about the actors in this film(mainly Leonardo DiCapreo) <br /> <br />I thought he was brilliant.  He played a funny, mischevious, handsome artist that opened Rose up and gave her a thing that her butthead fiancee couldn't-Hope.  He was perfect for this role.  I loved him in it and I was very proud of him in it-He really was Jack. <br /> <br />e.  It was full of cliches. <br /> <br />Refer to answer a. <br /> <br />WARNING <br />1.  Bring tissues-this is such a sad movie. <br />2.  Don't take young kids.  A lot of my friends were 5 and 6 when they first saw this.  I don't think this movie is appropriate for small children.  It's not even the sex scene or Jack drawing Rose-it's just the whole concept of the movie-small kids won't understand it, and might lose a bit of their innocence from being shown such subjets at such an early age.(I do have to agree with a reader who wanted to known how it did get a PG-13 rating-repeatively I checked to make sure it wasn't really rated R-I've seen R movies with my parents that have much less in them then the Titanic!)
B00005ASGG|5.0|I wish I could be around a hundred years from today to see whether John Wayne or James Stewart will be remembered as the most important actor who ever lived. Whichever one it is, you can be certain that the other will be #2. And this is certainly one of the finest films that either ever appeared in. Lee Marvin, another stellar personality, delivered a most convincing performance as a tough guy, but then he really was a United States Marine, and he was given a hero's burial at Arlington National Cemetery, unlike most of today's generation of thespians, whose only brush with reality was getting their lunch money taken away from them at school. Colonel Jimmy Stewart, Army Air Corps, piloted more than a few bomber sorties in WWII and retired as a Brigadier General in the USAFR.  And although the Duke never served in the military, he still managed to be the real thing, as noble and honorable as a human being can get.  Mourn for America, for their like will never walk among us again.
B000957O82|5.0|I have wanted to see the movie and got to see it this past Memorial Day weekend; Will is just as charming and fine as he can be; Eve Mendes is a great breath of fresh air; Kevin James; well, he played his role to the hilt; Kind of stole the darn show if you asked me; Will is smooth as a date doctor hooking up otherwise average men with the woman of their dreams;And oh, is he good; But when he gets with Eve, oh boy, he forgets the rules, and when somehow, Eve's character finds out that this date doctor had somehow caused her best friend pain, it goes from bad to worse; I plan to get this on DVD no doubt; I love romantic comedies; My favorite part: Will Smith dangling keys at Kevin James for a practice kiss; Classic. Another favorite part, Will taking Eve to Ellis Island and finding out about her relative who first come to America and all; Smooth; real smooth. but when his shirt gets caught in the cab door, another classic moment indeed;
B00079ZACM|5.0|Zoltan Korda's 1939 THE FOUR FEATHERS is one of the greatest action movies ever made.  Based on the 1902 novel of the same name by A.E.W. Mason, it's the tale of young British officer Harry Faversham (John Clements), who resigns his commission on the eve of his unit's departure to the Sudan.  Three of Faversham's comrades, including Capt. John Durrance (Ralph Richardson) send him white feathers attached to their cards in honor of his cowardice.  The fourth white feather comes from fiance Ethne Burroughs (June Duprez). Harry tells himself that duty to home - his father has recently died and the estate is in shambles - prevails over duty to country.  Of course it is never quite so simple in a country with a tradition of military honor, and Harry barely convinces even himself that he resigned because of anything but cowardice.  And so Harry Faversham, civilian, travels to the Sudan with feathers in tow to wipe the stain from his honor.   <br />  THE FOUR FEATHERS has been filmed many times, more than half a dozen at last count, the last one in 2002.  This is the one you want, though.  Made before Great Britain's colonial history was held up to harsh scrutiny, when the sense of military duty and honor were strongly held by a country in the midst of a desperate war, the 1939 film holds to those values without blush or falter.  Bolstered by marvelous performances by Clements, Richardson, and veteran actor C. Aubrey Smith as an old soldier, it's essential viewing for fans of action movies.   <br />
B0001Z52RU|4.0|This movie was a big surprise.  Ashton Kutcher was actually really really good in this movie.  You have to pay attention, and it's a good idea to watch both the director's cut ending and the original ending.  Both are cool.  I would have given this movie 5 stars except for the unnecessary and disturbing nudity/sex scenes.
B000002UY5|5.0|Blind Melons best album yet. No Rain features the best rythem, beat, and lyrics. Sensational
B00024I2Z4|3.0|Disney's Mulan doesn't rank too high on my list, it practically goes on the list of bottom 10.  I recently bought the Special Edition DVD release and did not enjoy the movie, that's why I hardly even took the time to look at the bonus features.  Disney was trying to go beyond their usual and classical formula of weak and lonesome heroines in need to be rescued, and they did a fine job at that, but they also went very, very wrong in other very important parts. <br />In order to make Mulan seem like a real heroine, or just to represent women in a more realistic way, they turned men into complete fools, absolutely brainless and dumb and that is where the film producers went extremely wrong.  Nowadays it seems that in lots of cartoons men are represented this way, as ugly, burping/spiting machines with no brains and shapeless bodies while women are represented as mature, intelligent, beautiful and reliable and this is simply not right.  But are all men in \\"Mulan\\" like that?  No, there's Shang, he seems like a fine representation of intelligence and bravery, until it goes overboard.  At one point, Shang held back his tears at a time in which it was very normal for any man to cry and I didn't like that, it makes you think that men are supposed to never show emotion or pain and that is not true and it really bothered me.  Other flaws in this movie included the very, very annoying voice of Eddie Murphy, although it seems that for once he is able to control his foul-mouth, which is somewhat nice.  Animation is sharp but the art to it is absolutely terrible, with the excuse of wanting to imitate Chinese art, the animators made the characters angular and sort of painful to watch.  It is also hard to care for the characters in this film since each of them seems highly flawed. <br />It is a shame that whenever Disney wants to go to new heights or step out of their classical style, they fail completely.  However, the film still has its high points, as I said, the animation is elaborate and sharp and the music is pretty cool (Except for when Raven sings in some of the bonuses, ugh!).  But even with these few highlights, it is hard for me to recommend the film, buy the soundtrack instead.  <br />
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Great reviews!  Nevertheless, there is a gift in this movie.  This is a beautiful story of a young lady facing the fantasy world that helped her cope with the grief, once too painful to experience without the shadow of darkness, becomes personified in the Phantom.  The phantom reveals himself at the cusp of time when she reunited with her childhood sweetheart.  Of course, she does choose to leave behind the phantom, thanking him as she sees him unveiled.  She is ready to say her last goodbye to her father.  The circle of life is complete as life in its entirety fulfills in death through the memories and grief of those whose lives we touch. <br />
B00005JMUL|5.0|I can't say how much I enjoyed this movie.  It brought back many good memories from my childhood.  The Polar Express was a favorite book of mine to read around the holiday time and I was so excited when I heard it would be a movie.  At first I was curious how they were going to turn a short book into a feature film, I was worried they might ruin the true message of the book and lose sight of the magic of the story, but I was blown away by the film.  The movie not only stayed true to the book, but the things they added just helped the story and the message that it sent out to people.  I cried when I first saw it, not because it was sad or anything, but it brought back such good memories of my childhood and how good it was to Believe and how simple life was when I was a kid and how I wish I could go back to those times.  This is with out a doubt my favorite holiday movie and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD because this is an instant classic.
B000002AS3|5.0|Before 1994, the British music scene was in the dumps, with bands like the Stone Roses no longer in effect.  Then out of nowhere comes the Gallagher brothers, and Oasis to kick the rock n roll scene back into gear. <br /> <br />The quickest selling debut album in history, Definitely Maybe stands as a solid rock at the base of an ever growing British rock mountain.  Not since then has their been a release to compare with this album. <br /> <br />This album contains the ultimate song in my book, Live Forever.  What an anthem.  Noel Gallagher can't deny that this simple song has to rate up there as his best tune to date.  It wasn't just a song, but a way of life.  The video with the pictures on the wall of Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, and John Lennon.. wow, powerful stuff.  I was instantly drawn to this band, and haven't been disappointed since. <br /> <br />There's not a single track one can skip over on this album.  From Rock and Roll Star, thru to Married With Children, this is the pinnacle of rock music.  Supersonic, Slide Away, Up in The Sky, it doesn't get better than this (but is equalled by their Morning Glory follow up).   <br /> <br />Buy this cd if you don't own it.  Own a piece of history!!!  WELL WORTH the 10 or 15 bucks!!!!!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber's music has given me much pleasure over the years. I live in Manhattan, and although I don't usually go to Broadway musicals unless I hear rave reviews, I saw \\"Phantom of the Opera,\\" and loved it. Director Joel Schumacher's film production is simply terrific, although somewhat flawed! I admit it is a bit bombastic at times, but the music is spectacular, as are the sets, cast and acting. I don't want to compare screen versus stage versions.They are totally different mediums and each lends unique and special moments. I have heard some call the film vulgar, and I say \\"Boo\\" on their snobbishness!<br /><br />As most know, this is a bizarre beauty and the beast kind of love story. Set in 1870's Paris, a talented, mysterious genius with a terribly scarred face lives in secret beneath the opera house, haunting the building, and those who spend much time there, with his spectral presence. Frequently heard from but never seen, he composes brilliant music, writes operas, designs sets, etc.. His life of solitude and bitterness have driven him mad. Unbeknownst to any, he has been lovely, young soprano Christine Daae's mentor and voice teacher since her childhood. The young woman believes that he is her beloved deceased father's spirit and calls him her \\"angel of music.\\" He has grown to love the innocent ingenue with the exquisite voice. When the two appear together the ambiance is shadowed and otherworldly, and Christine always seems hypnotized - which is quite credible given the Phantom's sheer force of personality. One night the Prima Donna walks out on a performance and Christine takes her place. When Raoul, a wealthy young nobleman, (Patrick Wilson), sees the extraordinary young singer, he falls in love. The Phantom does not take competition lightly.<br /><br />Schumacher's production is fantastically gothic, as is Gaston Leroux's novel, upon which all opera phantoms are based. Gerard Butler, as the deformed anti-hero, is the epitome of the dominant Gothic Hero. He would be superb as Mr. Rochester or Heathcliff.....but I digress. Let it suffice to say he makes a superior \\"Phantom of the Opera.\\" Although I very much like his voice, some say it does not measure up to the rest of the casts'. Mr. Butler, however, more than makes-up for any lack of vocal power with his charisma, virility and powerful stage presence. He uses eroticism and sensuality to seduce, perfectly, especially when he brings Christine to his lair, deep in the watery depths beneath the opera house, and sings \\"Music of the Night.\\"  \\"Touch me, trust me / savour each sensation!\\" And, \\"Open up your mind / let your fantasies unwind / in this darkness which you know you cannot fight.\\" He smolders in \\"Point of No Return,\\" which is one very steamy number. There are times when I see Butler's Phantom as a vampire-like figure - a dark, deeply handsome, all powerful vampire - not a ghoulish one. With his slicked back dark wig, tux, sensual lips and mask, he looks a forceful figure from the underworld - (which he is) - beckoning Christine to leave the \\"garish light of day,\\" and come, \\"Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before! / Let your soul take you where you long to be! / Only then can you belong to me.\\" In the scene where he spies on Christine and Raoul on the opera roof, hiding amidst the gargoyles, he picks up the rose she has dropped in the snow and holds it to his lips. Almost everything in the shot is black and white except for the red rose at his mouth...like drops of blood. That's vampire-like!! (reminiscent of Frank Langella's 1970's Dracula, not Bela Lugosi's).<br /><br />Eighteen year-old Emmy Rossum is absolutely luminous as Christine. The sound of her spectacular, opera-trained voice is alone worth the price of the DVD. Ms. Rossum is a talented actress, and her innocent fresh look is a perfect compliment to Butler's dark, menacing specter, and Patrick Wilson's handsome swashbuckling viscount. Wilson's romantic handsomeness and fabulous tenorvoice make him an exceptional choice for the hero part. The real taut passion, however, is between Butler and Rossum. This magnetic force between them is one aspect of the movie I prefer over the play. The phantom is cast as a much older man in the stage production, and when he is unmasked one feels totally repulsed, and not very sympathetic. He becomes merely one more aging man lusting after a young woman. Also, Christine knows him so well that perhaps she doesn't see him as quite the monster the audience does. There are qualities she has been drawn to, before she saw his whole face. Her empathy is not totally destroyed by the grotesque image. The younger, handsomer version of the Phantom permits a certain believable ambivalence in her feelings, which makes for more tension in the storyline.<br /><br />Andrew Lloyd Weber collaborated closely with Schumacher throughout the making of the movie. The supporting cast is excellent with Miranda Richardson as Mme. Giry, Ciaran Hinds as Fermin, Simon Callow as Andre, and Minnie Driver as Carlotta, the spoiled diva. Although Ms. Driver is hilarious in her role, she spends too much time, with too many lines, onstage. The campiness works well as comic relief. However, the effect is lost with an overabundance of this and becomes kitsch.<br /><br />Finally, buy the 2-Disc Special, when purchasing the DVD. The second disc, approximately 45 minutes, is entitled \\"Behind the Mask: The Story of The Phantom of the Opera,\\" and documents the journey from Gaston Leroux's novel to the silent film, to Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage version, and finally to Joel Schumacher's feature film. Included in this documentary are interviews with the principals. There are also several wonderful clips from early performances that took place at Andrew Lloyd Webber's estate before the musical was completed. Also included is an excised scene which features Gerard Butler as the Phantom, singing his part in \\"No One Would Listen.\\"<br />JANAional choice for the hero part.

B000002C25|4.0|Oasis had a hard job, in '97 trying to follow up the epic (What's the Story)Morning Glory album.  And all in all, I believe they did it right. <br /> <br />No, this isn't another Definitely Maybe, or Morning Glory, but it's a classic in it's own rite.  It's a louder album, and is meant to kick you in the behind.   <br /> <br />D'Ya Know What I Mean? takes the chord progression of Wonderwall, and turns it up on the volume knob to 11.  \\"Step off the train, all alone at dawn.. back into the hole where I was born, sun in the sky never raised an eye to me..\\"  Wow, Liam has this track down as one of his best vocals. <br /> <br />Follow this up with the rip your face off, \\"My Big Mouth,\\" and you may be wondering, is this Oasis?  These are followed by the 7 minute long, Magic Pie, sung by Noel.  If anything, some may say that this song goes on too long.  I'll give them that.  But it's a beautiful song, none the less. <br /> <br />Stand By Me and I Hope I think I Know are 2 fun, upbeat songs.  The Girl in The Dirty Shirt was a fave of mine from the first time I heard it.  A very fun chord progression and vocals.  Well done! <br /> <br />Track 7, Fade In Out, is unlike anything done by Oasis to this point.  This song has Jonny Depp on the slide guitar, and fits in well with the first couple tracks. <br /> <br />Don't Go Away was supposed to be the next Wonderwall, but it never took off like it should have.  Has a terrific acoustic guitar outro at the end.  Gets me everytime. <br /> <br />Be Here Now.. loud, and in your face like the first few songs. <br /> <br />All Around the World, Oasis' longest track recorded.  A very melodic song, with a definite Beatles feel to it.  And the video is very \\"Yellow Submarine.\\"  Ended with Noel and Liam singing the \\"la la la's\\" you can't help but get goose bumps.  Well done guys! <br /> <br />It's Getting Better Man is simple, down and out rock n roll song.  Very Oasis. <br /> <br />And finished by the All Around the World reprise, a fun finish to this album. <br /> <br />This album was supposed to have made Oasis the kings of rock n roll, and get them over the proverbial hump here in the states, but never did.  It's too bad, cos this is flat out - awesome piece of rock n roll here!!
1400082773|5.0|Barack Obama is just sprouting his wings as a U.S. Senator from Illinois. And with this guy's talent for writing and speaking, as far as I'm concerned, he's probably the shiniest up-and-coming bright star for the Democrat party yet. But Obama need not worry if he chooses to walk away from a political career anytime in the near future, because he's a lawyer. The guy is sharp as a razor, and probably one of the best writers of non-fiction that I've had the pleasure to read, if not the best. Obama took a true story and wrote like it was fiction. Now that takes talent in my book. So if nothing else, he could set his mind to just writing books and make a pretty good living. If he remains on the political scene for very long, no doubt he'll have some great writing material. Unfortunately, I missed Obama's keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. Too bad, too, because after reading his speech at the end of this book, I'd have enjoyed hearing every word of it, I'm sure. The guy is a gifted speaker, has a way with words that's his very own style, and appears to care deeply for his people. Let's hope, as he's said and written, that his deep concern for helping others can, and will, extend to all races...as it should. <br />The reviews that have already been written about Obama's book pretty well explain its content, except for the negative reviews which were only a few. And after reading some of those negative reviews, makes one think they were written by some neo-cons that view Obama as a threat to the present reigning political party. And with good cause, because Obama will go as far as his heart desires no matter what his future endeavors might be. <br />I'm for Barack Obama whether he's writing a book, practicing law, or running for President of the United States.  <br />
B000002BBY|5.0|This is as good as it gets folks.  Who would have thought, that these lads from Manchester could top the phenomenonal debut album, Definitely Maybe?  Well, they did, and it's as good as all these reviews will have you believe. <br /> <br />If for nothing else, buy this album for it's influence on today's music scene.  Would there be a Travis, or a Coldplay, or Doves, or Kasabian if Morning Glory hadn't been released?  Probably, but their music would not be as good as it is.. why?  Because they all have Oasis' first 2 cd's to thank for it's inspiration.  <br /> <br />You've got the well known classics, Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger, Morning Glory, and Champagne Supernova.  But don't leave out Roll With It.  If you're looking for a song overflowing with that arrogant attitude we all love from Oasis, this is it.  Just watch this song live on Then and There.  You also get Some Might Say, which is another outrite anthem when performed live. <br /> <br />Hey Now is a simple, yet driven song that gets me, and Cast No Shadow is a powerful ballad written for Richard Ashcroft of the Verve.  She's Electric is a party of a 4 minute song, and Hello gets things started with a bang. <br /> <br />Even the 2 Swamp Songs, work wonderfully as transitions between tracks 5 and 7, and 10 and 12. <br /> <br />This cd will long be regarded as a cornerstone of rock n roll music, I'm sure of it.  It plays as well today as it did back in '95.  A pleasure to listen to, straight thru.  GO GET IT!
B000002U8G|4.0|Im giving this album 4.99 stars. If this album was by any other group than Floyd, it would attain 5 star status instantly. However, its a Floyd work so I'm more critical. They have to stand up to standards that would just destroy any other band. Now dont get me wrong, I LOVE this album. It has shades of \\"Dark Side\\" written all over it. Some claim its a practice run for what would become the greatest piece of musical experimentation ever laid on vinyl. This album shows that Floyd can really jam for long periods and not lose the listeners attention. Also, they were really experimenting with various sound effects and backround noise on this album. It's really quite a wonderful album, but for ME (notice I said me here, dont threaten to kill me) there are one or two songs on here that just dont do it for me, and thats a complete annomoly on a Floyd album. Im usually stuck in a state of musical rapture as soon as that first glorious note floats out of my speakers and embeds itself in my head (soul??). I would say that this album starts off a little slow, but by the end, its another Floyd masterpiece. This is, of course, a must have for any real Floyd fan. Its interesting to start with \\"Piper\\" and run through their albums in sequential order to see how thy matured and changed their sound. One wonders would Floyd have been better had Syd Barrett not transfered himself permanently into the nether regions of sanity with LSD?? Or was the addition of David Gilmour (another genius, in my mind) a godsend. Maybe the all and powerful lord (???) is a Floyd fan. Or maybe it was the devil.
B00004XOWM|2.0|Limp Bizket does nothing for me..in fact, I find myself slightly pissed off after listening to this cd( which was given to me by a friend who didnt want it anymore.)Fred Durst is a sexist and his angry/rap/metal thing is just boring....the band can obviously play their instruments but the nu-metal sound is just boring and repetitive and the lyrics are for the most part trash( \\"play that f*cking track!\\" \\"You dont wana f**k with me today cuz a little something something didnt go your way\\")If you want angry music than listen to some real punk rock and if you like the rap/rock sound then for the love of god listen to some old school chili peppers! Do yourself a favor!
