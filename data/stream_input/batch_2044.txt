B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like the orginial version much better than this version. Thiis version is difficult to see and appear very close to the screen.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Fun game to play. Really helps to have a good artist sending stuff to you. Some of the words aren't words that I have ever seen but fun.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This is a sleeper....a good movie.  Has a definitive cool factor.  If you are a fan of pure action movies, you'll like this one!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I LOVE this game; I really do but the only problem with it is that when I first went on it; it was fine but when I went on it again it took FOREVER to load; it took so long that I did not even get to play.  Other than that it is a really good game and I recommend it for animal lover's.
0316228532|5.0|Once again, I gave this new book from J.K. Rowling to a friend for Christmas, someone whose boys read every Harry Potter book.  I'm sure it's a good read, and will read it after she is finished.
034580404X|1.0|My husband bought me the trilogy for Christmas, and I must say it is one of the worst gifts he's ever bought for me. Not his fault of course... he, like me, believed the hype. I'm really not sure why these books are so popular. The writing is mediocre at best, what I've read so far has been boring (I only managed to get halfway through the second book), and the sex scenes aren't good or very descriptive. I could put up with the bad writing and boring plot if the sex was hot, but I actually started skipping over the sex scenes. Every scene is the same: he gets her all hot and bothered, she says things such as \\"oh my\\" and \\"jeez\\" and \\"holy cow\\" and \\"he's so freakin hot\\" a lot in her mind, they do their thing for a few seconds, and she \\"explodes\\" as she likes to describe it. Mr. Grey doesn't seem to be especially good either. He tells her on more than one occasion \\"this is going to be quick.\\" Personally not something I would want to hear from a guy. Sometimes he spanks her, ties her up, or blindfolds her and makes her listen to music during their sessions, but it doesn't make it any more exciting. Aside from the boring sex scenes, the main characters have no depth and use very awkward sounding dialogue. They say \\"shall\\" all the time which seems weird to me since the books take place in 2011 and they are both in their 20s. Ana is an idiot and acts like she's 15 despite being a 21 year old college graduate. Christian's character is just weird, as is Ana's reaction to him. Instead of being freaked out by him stalking her and admitting that he enjoys hurting women, she is drawn to him. I expect it's because he's \\"so freakin hot\\" and very rich... but of course Ana doesn't care about his money or his lavish gifts to her (ha!). If you are interested in reading a good erotic novel that involves BDSM, pick up a copy of Story of O or the Sleeping Beauty trilogy by Anne Rice. Sleeping Beauty does get a bit repetitive, but at least the sex scenes are good. Story of O is kind of disturbing, but a good story. If you want to read Fifty Shades, borrow it from a friend so you don't waste your money.
0670026603|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I didn't want to talk to anyone, or do anything, except read this book.  This is the first of Jojo Moyes' novels I've read and I'm so grateful that it was an Amazon pick.  The characters are engaging and the story is both heartbreaking and heartwarming.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|everytime i try to play it. It closes by it self with a black screen. thats why i gave it a one star rating
B008K8X0IS|5.0|At first while reading other reviews, I was unsure what this all came with. After opening it I was glad to see it came with everything I thought it would.<br /><br />Items include:<br />First season on blu-ray<br />First season on dvd<br />Second season episode one on blu-ray<br />Digital copy of season one<br />Paperweight egg<br /><br />I got it on sale so it was a deal I couldn't pass up. I would recommend it to anyone that's a fan, especially if you have a blu-ray. The quality is amazing and you still get the dvd discs as backup. Truly the perfect collector's edition.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|This book is very helpful. It helped me find out what phonetic means. Also it told me if a Coconut is a nut or a fruit.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I got this for my 12 year old son.  He really likes it!  He already had the original Perplexus.  He found this to be much more difficult. This is better because it entertains him for a longer period of time. Once he solved the original, he lost interest. So this is great for him and me!
0525478817|5.0|I could not put this book down- touching, honest, beautifully written. I would HIGHLY recommend it.  You won't be disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is just like temple run but with better graphics new ropes and mine cart sectins and cooler chartercs
B003ODIZL6|4.0|This book is very helpful. It helped me find out what phonetic means. Also it told me if a Coconut is a nut or a fruit.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|just awesome series.  Can't wait until 9 PM Sunday nights for the next very fast moving, exciting drama Hour.  Just wish it lasted longer than 8 or nine epic. 10 stars is my rating
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wonderfully written, couldn't put it down. On to the next book as fast as I can pick it up. Beautiful.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is better than the first temple run, but if Imangi studios has an update, make new characters. Just saying
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good graphics and storyline.  Hidden objects were good, but would of liked to see more of them.  Would recommend this game.
030746363X|5.0|I am currently reading this in sections. Most books you have to read in order. However this book you can read out of order and still get some pretty awesome info. It has some really interest theories that I will begin to try next week. So far it is engaging and has my attention
B007SGM084|1.0|the great reviews this gets. Ugh, I struggled to finish it and only because I didn't want my money to go to waste. The writing was atrocious and dull, her inner monologues were repetitive, and the storyline was so predictable I knew the next page before I read it. And, if she had said to herself 'Oh my' one more time, I would have thrown my e-reader across the room.<br />This series was irritating, an obvious knock off of another design (Twilight anyone?), and a candy coated poorly done erotica book. Don't waste your money, it's just a fad.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this book. I cried like a baby and it made me realize ally of things. Thank you John green
B000QCQ8Y4|2.0|Reacher is getting boring for me. Too many short sentences and way too much boring filler. I get it the highways in Cali r slow,but not quite as slow as this book.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|hi huh hi huh hi Hui huihhbhg huff g g g g g g g b h b v g
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King doing what he does best. At 853 pages, there is a lot of entertainment for your money. There is a little down time here and there, but it is usually to set up the next action. It is also easy to predict that most of your favorite characters will not make it out alive or unscarred, but that has long been a King trademark. The nice thing about a time traveling story is that the ending, while not what you would call a happy ending is satisfying as the main characters are able to reconnect in the end.<br />Also, King's prediction as to what would happen to the world is very realistic and not some liberal's fantasy camp. He credits historian Doris Kearns Goodwin for an assist, and the historical \\"what if\\" supplies yet one more level of entertainment value.<br />  Long time KIing fans will appreciate the inclusion of characters from his novel \\"it\\" which again shows King's genius taking advantage of time travel to tie together the recurring theme of evil, especially when it comes to that God forsaken town of Derry.<br />  As King first got his idea for the book in 1972, but allowed the ideas and facts to marinate ( or perhaps ferment in King's case), the book is fodder for the imagination of anyone who grew up in the fifties and sixties America. I also enjoyed the many mentions of long gone products sold during that time, that make the reader stop and say, \\"oh yeah, I remember that stuff\\". Altogether, this is a tour de force for King.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Loved it!  I really liked how you sort of have to figure out what's going on for yourself. I would recommend it to anyone  over 13.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Looper was simply a movie with perverse, gratuitous violence.  Think of it as a horrible combination of T ime Cop meats Soylent Green.
0374275637|5.0|I purchased this as a gift. The recipient read very good reviews about the book and loves it so far.
B008MEM24S|5.0|a challenging game for all ages.  wish there were some description to guide plAyer with each  screen to have an idea as to how to play.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved all three books! I couldn't put them down to save my life. Read all three of them in less than two weeks, and I don't ever read.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This movie continued on the story of the dark knight, and did it so amazingly, so fluidly, that it's near impossible to describe. This is an amazing movie, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Was very sad when I finished the last page of this book as it meant the end of the trilogy.  Panem created great characters and character studies and a very scary look at dystopic future if we don't actually learn from our past.  Thank you Ms Collins for your attention to detail and fertile imagination.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Fantastic program for the Kindle. Is great for tracking power usage and very good predictor of battery life for different uses, like reading, music, games, and movies.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game was fun but it needs more games with running and kid related they f2f ;) :) I think others would enjoy this game
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game.  I always play in my free time.<br />it is always a challenge to try to win.<br />try it and see.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So moving-- I can't put into words how I feel- makes you question your own life and what truly is important.
B005KELW26|4.0|I had to send this back as soon as I received it.  It's very pretty but it is too small for the Fire HD 7.&#34;
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Is awesome game love it. I recommend to get it, it burns a lot of my free time. So if your bored a lot you should get this game.
B005KELW26|4.0|Nice cover , like how the tab keeps it closed.Easy to hold and the cover wipes clean.Glad I have it.
B000641Z90|5.0|Bought myself DVD for Christmas.  This is music that gets played over and over.  Very fun to watch and amazing music!

B005K17RU0|2.0|Does not rotate when you rotate your kindle. Otherwise decent but not impressive. I have a better app on my BlackBerry.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|good way to keep up with friends love the app games and all .Im not into the whole the update.
B000005B0U|5.0|Bought the DVD used in &#34;very good condition&#34; for $8 cents.  Love the DVD!  The only way to play it is LOUD!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book tells the story of what the brave members of our military go through to serve our country.  A story you will never hear from the media.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is relly fun! When I got it I new it would be fun! You should get it! Its fun when you groom it at level 6 its worth waiting for!<br />This is my very favorite app I have! I think I have 30 and my horse is my favorite! Get it!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|THERE IS NO WAY TO REPAY BRAVE WARRIORS LIKE THIS WHO PROTECT US. HOPEFULLY IT IS ENOUGH FOR THEM THAT MANY OF US THANK GOD FOR THEM AND HAVE TO WIPE TEARS FOR THE FALLEN ONES.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I was dissapointed. The theme seemed to emphasize the &#34;sex life af the characters&#34; which does follow current practices in our world.
B009WJ44KC|5.0|John Williams composes timeless music for every movie.  He continues to create the soundtrack of our history that not only entertains, but transports us into the past.
B0049CVUNG|5.0|Absolutely loved this show, and can't wait to see it again.<br />Has anyone found a this on cd yet? Haven't been able to find it, and I don't think one exists.<br /><br />Help, please. Thanks!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Like seriously this is the best way to update the first temple run. Temple Run 2 makes the previous one look like CRAP!!!<br /><br />Here are some reasons why this game is SICK<br /><br />1. Cave Coasters - Its really fast and not boring at all.<br /><br />2.Tight ropes - The tight ropes are a cool addition to Temple Run
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This last,( maybe not?), book in the Game of Thrones series is also a winner. I gave it a 4 star rating only because I am still reading it right now. I have trouble putting it down but have to because of time constraints but I pick it up as soon as I can. I find myself taking my Kindle with me everywhere just so I can keep reading the story. Great book and I recommend it highly. I also hope the series is continued after this book.
1568363931|5.0|Love this book. I wanted to try making a bento to pack to work and bought this on a whim. I'm so glad I did. The instructions are easy and the meals are yummy.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Me Before You grabs the reader from the beginning.  You are caught up in the lives of Lou and Will.  The tragedy of Will's life as a quadripalegic is immediately thrown at the reader as well as the hum-drum life of Louise.  These two persons become entwined and the reader joins them in the plight to save the life of Will even though he wishes for an end to it.  The reader becomes the cheerleader for those persons working in Will's life to create a desire for meaning and purpose to his life.  A great read that keeps the reader involved!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is an amazing game, just as fun as the first, and just slightly harder. But I do have one problem. I was playing it not too long ago and when I died and hit &quot;Save Me&quot;, it crashed and I had to reopen it all. It hasn't done it since, but I was really disappointed then. Other than that, it's a great game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A lot of fun... it's like I get sucked up into this. I'm constantly playing this. My boyfriend actually gets jealous over the game.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Dr. Chapman,  thank you.  Just finished the book, took the profile. Husband is about to do the profile.  Life is about to change.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I love this movie! It was very easy to download onto my kindle, and the picture is very clear. Highly recommend!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|great game if u like being in control<br />I would reccomend to anyone who likes those kind of games have a good day
B00001OH82|5.0|Tin Machine, led by the chameleon himself - David Bowie. I love this album. It's bluesy adult rock ambiance sounds full and rounded and reminds me of Big Head Todd & the Monsters' Beautiful World album. This is, in my opinion, Bowie's underrated climax. There's not one track on this album that doesn't satisfy.
B004Y042N8|5.0|it's fun and att time it's a challenge.  it's also fun g to play with my granddaughter she loves it too
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love the Case for my Kindle Fire HD7. It fits perfectly I really like that its very easy to stand using the Case.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is more challenging and more exciting than Temple Run. I really like it, except every time I try to use a gem to revive myself the app closes and looses all of the things I earned (coins, objectives) in that run.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is just like the show the girls i babysit watch. We play all the time while i help them and now there going around school writting letters the princess about friendship! Great job on the game guys!
B007S1RGUQ|5.0|Hmmm, thought I was already asked to rate this...  but no matter, we're into a new year and, looking back, I'm rating it in the top two or three albums of 2012. But, that's just my rating based on her great voice and guitar on some decent tunes. Nothing surprising there - she's been an outstanding blues favorite of mine for as long as I can remember.<br /><br />I don't care for a lot of the top songs and albums that are published say, inside back cover of Rolling Stone, and don't expect to see Bonnie Raitt in the list very often, if at all. But, for whatever reason, I've been asked to rate this purchase. So, I rate it as very good. If you're into blues, you certainly know that Bonnie Raitt is an outstanding performer and Slipstream is a decent album.<br /><br />Fortunately, it's easy to listen to track samples before buying an album. Or, buying favorite mp3s for those who prefer that approach. If you are into Bonnie Raitt, blues or just plain good music, there's no need to care how I rate the album. Listen to the samples and make your own call. Just don't miss out.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was stopped to do this review, I'm annoyed because I want to keep reading. So there's your answer... It's good.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|Lots of extra writing. At times the book was rather rather boring. Still a great and heartbreaking story. Well written.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|My son saved his money for a long time to purchase this Lego set.  He loves it.  He said it was lots of fun to build.  It's lots of fun to play with especially when you combine it with other Lego sets and characters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it. It is different than the one. Can not wait for the third one. I love temple run 3
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|As an educator for more than 15 years working in both high poverty and middle class schools, this book speaks volumes about the changing face of education and of the student as well.  A must read!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I loved how sweet Alex was.  the ending could have been a little better.  They could have told how they get married and lived happily ever after!!!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|.... the slower rate with all the details are what makes this story. All the characters play a part in this story. there are new characters, but instead of getting away from the storyline G.RR.M. is adding to it. Making it a nice long story. His characters, both past and present are all tied in. So have patience and enjoy the story. I don't understand all the neg. feedback. Usually when a storyline ends, we're sad to see it end. The author is putting so much into this story as to make it a nice ;ong story. I love those kind the best.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I did like it but it really wasnt one of my things I really got it for the kiddos.  It will make you think for sure tho and has bright colors!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it was being weird. it wouldn't let me go on it, and when I uninstalled it, it kept saying open when I clicked on it, and when I would try to reunistall it. it would say not found in installed apps.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Attractive, interesting story. Enjoyable, runs well. Note, though, that this is free for only part of the game; to continue the story, you will need to purchase to unlock. You get an excellent feel for it from the free section, though, and should be pretty sure by then if yourevwilling to pay to unlock the rest.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I can't imagine why this got some neg. feedback. The story is really good. The author does go into alot of details, and we can get impatient about wanting to know whats going to happen, but the fine details make he story what it is. A really good read.I can't wait for more,
B008XG1X18|5.0|What can you say???? We all love Pintrest it is so neat all things you can learn how to do on there! I recommended to all my friends!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is an awesome sequel to a great game.  It's full of unexpected obstacles, and new powerups to help you as you run, run, run!  I've had a few problems when I had no wifi, but everything else is wonderful!  The 3-D graphics are better than ever and the bring the game to life.  I'm glad that this game has finally been released on Amazon!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This App has a fantastically large amount of sounds as well as presets that make it easy to use!<br /><br />My girlfriend and I use this to fall asleep or to relax. From listening to rain and thunder to the soft sound of an urban city at night in my case. This app also comes with certain wavelengths of sound to help you achieve certain kinds of rest or to help calm your mind down.<br /><br />An amazing addition to my app library as well as an awesome way for me to fight the stress of day to day life!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is a great app. It is very addicting. My opinion is you should get it. It is a lot like Mario Bros
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is very entertaining. my sister has this game and loves to play it! she loves being able to interact with her \\"own special horse\\"!!!
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I have been enjoying this .  It's fun.  the only thing is getting used to the notes coming down and being fast enough to catch them.  But  I'm sure with more practice I will get better.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|This app lends itself to keeping track of steam sales, to downloading games to your computer, you can even start a download on your computer (so long as it's on and Steam is turned on,) from a mobile device.<br /><br />This app also displays your friends list and allows you to chat with said friends. All and all a great app!<br /><br />No cons.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Did not like the pop-ups.  I like to play the game  & that's it,nothing else.  Solataire is a singel game
B0067Q42BY|5.0|It if a fun challenging game to play.  The ate 3 different levels to play, so if it is a good game for every level.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|BINGO BLITZ is the best bingo game on the net.  I enjoy the new seasonal games offered.  I recommend it.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this app but it takes away coins unexpectedly and I don't like the gems. It could be better
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe haven is one of those books that touch the hearts of the readers. This book is truly amazing I can't help but tea  it over and over again. The characters truly talked to me. I felt every thing they felt as I read. This book is amazing!
B0071BY2OG|3.0|I had such high expectations because I had owned and watched Faster quite a few times.  The main difference between the two is the focus on GP Moto's golden boy, Valentino Rossi, which is to say not a bad thing.  However, instead of canvasing the entirety of the GP Moto sport, it boils down to the story of one rider's goal to win back the crown after reaching his nadir.<br /><br />In hindsight, I think the production crew would have been better off asking Ewan McGregor to narrate a piece on the Isle of Man TT instead.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-still covers the excitement of Moto GP<br />-race footage seems so clear<br /><br />Cons:<br />-so many other teams and riders take the backseat to the Lorenzo/Rossi rivalry<br />-not much for special features
B0063B2BNE|4.0|I was in the middle of watching all the old series of this show.  I was happy to see I had the option to purchase from Amazon.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|It's one thing to put together a plot with twists and turns.  But this book takes it to a whole new level.  You get twisted and turned and ratcheted up as the characters interactions complicate.<br /><br />What makes this book stand out is that the ending is both far fetched AND plausible.  That's a rare combo - too often an author must choose between the two.<br /><br />I've taken to writing reviews because my Kindle Fire prompts me to after the last page of each book.  I try to keep them very nebulous as there are more talented plot reviews and summarizers out there.<br /><br />My notes are general impressions and serve as a personal online reminder as to what books I've enjoyed (or not).  If you like the books I've liked, you can click to find others.  I'm always looking for a friend to send me a \\"new author,\\" so I write these as if I am that friend.
B00846REIS|5.0|Very good! Couldn't' put it down! Bared to You was a very<br />EnjoyAble novel. Interesting characters. I highly recommend it..Bared To You.
B0034G4P80|4.0|A very good value DVD of very good movie. The disk is just what you would and should expect from a value priced disc release and it is well worth the money spent. Recommended highly.
0062082353|4.0|We, as Americans, should all be aware of the battles in which we place our warriors.<br />Mr. Kyle has the gift of telling a story that is gritty, bloody and heart wrenching. The tasks<br />we assign our SEALS would be daunting by any measure, yet Chris makes it seem effortless<br />and minimizes the horrendous risks he took to complete his missions.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|While this book is okay. I wouldn't have chosen it to read myself. I did this for a book club read.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I got this for my niece to play. I play it all the time!<br /><br />now she laughs at for always playing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is a great app and I definitely recommend this app. There are a ton of new settings and cool features. If u want a fun app, get temple run two. It might even be better than the first temple run. Get this app and u will be hooked.
B0043URV5U|5.0|Bob Seger is one of the greatest rock stars of all time.  His talent in writing and performing speaks for itself. I came of age with his music in the 1970s and have enjoyed it ever since.  The pure, stirring vocals (no need to be synthesized), instrumentation that is perfection and overall vibe of the tracks makes this CD a must-have for anyone who appreciates artistry of this caliber.  Whether one is feeling \\"lonely and beat\\", needs music that \\"just soothes the soul\\" or simply wants to listen to someone who sings like he knows how you are feeling and what you are thinking, there is no better choice.  Pardon me as I let it now \\"rolll me away...\\"
B000YGIIQI|4.0|A very personal and interesting look into one of the great chefs of our generation. More than the chef we see on tv and as must read for anyone interested in the culinary arts
B000000OPU|2.0|This was so hyped in the media and I was so excited to get it.  It really let me down.  There wasn't the volume of music nor the quality of sound that was advertised.  I love the artist but this left me flat.
B004GYY714|5.0|We travel the country side frequently. With this app, we can listen to radio stations from our home area.  . We hook up our iphone or other wifi device to the car radio. It's also great in hotel rooms where the radios are like relics of the portable  transistor radio era.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run was a very fun game but the second is a smash hit. The whole thing is new with a different setting and powerups. One word: spectacular.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game cause it's like you have a real horse it's so much fun for everybody. You get to clean, play, pet,and even feed the horse
0345803485|2.0|I felt like I was reading Twilight all over again. A heroine with crippling low self esteem who is barely able to walk in a straight line, and acts/ reads about ten years younger than her age, meets an overwhelmingly handsome, mysterious, cold, controlling, paternalistic hero who conveniently 'rescues' her at every turn. He is very wealthy and has stalker tendencies. . . I kept expecting him to sprout fangs Edward Cullen style. The only reason I gave the book an extra star was for its comic value - the ridiculous sex scenes had me 'lol-ing' on more than one occasion. With a hero who is 'ever the gentleman' and a heroine who is a 'good girl', promising to honour and obey, I felt like I stepped back in time about 200 years - it is this really what women want from a man??
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I'd recommend this to any United States of American that wants to see what kind of threat we are facing in todays world. Who can we trust? What happens to a POW? What do they bring home with them? How does the family at home cope?<br />How does the retutning POW cope? WOW, great show!! We stayed up until our eyes hurt to try and see what was going to happen next.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I'm a huge Preston & Child fan, read every word those guys write, and I've been waiting for this one for what seems like ages.  Pendergast was amazing, as always, and I was sorry to see it end.  The concept that when one is seeking revenge, one should dig two graves, is true!  Revenge, whether served cold or hot, damages everyone involved and this is certainly the case here, although Pendergast deserved vindication and got it!  However, there's another evil Pendergast on the loose, and, now that his brother is dead... or so we think.... we have a new villain to look forward to!<br /><br />Write faster, guys, I'm not getting any younger!<br /><br />Highly recommend Two Graves.

B006OB3K56|3.0|After hearing a lot of great things about Shame, I have to say I came away from it slightly disappointed. The story follows sex-addict Brandon Sullivan (Michael Fassbender), whose mundane and brutal existence is interrupted by the arrival of his sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan). The film exposes the sordid underbelly of Manhattan and follows the breakdown of the relationship between the two siblings, as Brandon becomes increasingly irritated and suffocated by Sissy's presence.<br /><br />McQueen purposely leaves out the protagonists' back-story, leaving it up to the viewer to imagine what 'shameful' upbringing led to their neurotic and isolated adult lives. The problem I had with this was that it was hard to feel any sort of empathy for the siblings as they unravelled desperately throughout the film, or to feel any emotional response towards them by the end. Thus when Sissy did her (agonisingly) slow rendition of `New York, New York' which brings Brandon to tears, I was left emotionally cold and slightly bored. Also, although I found the majority of the sex-scenes important in revealing Brandon's desires and motivations, I found myself really irritated by the final threesome, which dragged on forever and seemed entirely gratuitous. I was not convinced by the casting choice of having Mulligan play Sissy, as I did not find her quite manic or desperate enough and she appeared slightly one-dimensional throughout.<br /><br />Having said that, there were a lot of great moments in the film - Fassbender's acting was phenomenal throughout and the film was well-paced and shot beautifully - showing the gritty underside of urban life and the cold, bare monotonous routine of Brandon's sex-obsessed existence. The relationship between Sissy and Brandon was compelling (and uncomfortable) to watch; plagued by need, anger and incestuous desire. The most interesting parts of the film were the scenes between Brandon and his recently separated co-worker, Marianne, as they debated the point of monogamy in modern life, and eventually embarked on a doomed sexual encounter. Although I thought the film had its flaws, Steve McQueen's directorial style was unique, beautifully real and definitely thought-provoking, which made them somewhat forgivable.
B009MF56GC|3.0|We both liked the way the movie kept moving. My popcorn was gone before the action really started. set back and enjoy.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Woody Allen's latest film is a beautiful and amusing homage to Paris in the 1920s. It follows Gil (Owen Wilson) and his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams) on their holiday in Paris. Both Wilson and McAdams played their parts fantastically: McAdams plays a beautiful and spoilt, all-American blonde who is exasperated by Gil's romantic and fantastical musings and Wilson plays a whimsical Hollywood script writer,who is desperate to escape America and move to Paris to become a successful novelist.<br /><br />Wilson plays the Woody Allen protagonist wonderfully, capturing Allen's signature neurotic intelligence without becoming a cheap imitation of his acting. From the outset is it obvious the two characters are a mismatch and Gil soon leaves Inez' company to go on solitary late-night walks through Paris. As the clock strikes midnight, a vintage car pulls up and he is transported back to his favourite era, the 1920s. He meets all the major artists of the period: the Fitzgerald's have fantastic energy and Allen's depictions of Ernest Hemingway and Salvador Dali are hilarious.<br /><br />I loved the lavish and indulgent, nostalgic celebration of the 1920's complete with jazz music, beautiful dresses and wild partying. Marion Cottilard, the 'art-groupy', loved by Hemingway and Picasso is beautiful and captivating, perfectly suited to the glamour of the 1920s. The shots of the cobbled streets of Paris in the dusky street-lit darkness are stunning: the film is a touching and beautiful musing on time, nostalgia and love and you cannot help but follow in Gil's footsteps and fall in love with the city in this beautiful and inspiring film.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|One of my son's favorite movies.  The DVD is high quality and my son was glad to receive this as a gift. We would recommend this to anyone who is a Batman fan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book has me enthralled from beginning to end even though I already new how it ended. Much better then the movie. Will definitely read again.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|The Holmes series is completely entertaining . . . clever, not melodramatic drama and intrigue, like most mysteries attempt to be, and both actors are excellent both individually and together.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|Having watched the big Steven Spielberg Hollywood blockbuster about the holocaust, Schindler's List, I was much more moved by Benigni's attempt to show the courage and pain of the Jewish victims in his film, Life is Beautiful. The plot follows the Jewish character,Guido Orifici, as he attempts to woo his 'principessa', the beautiful Dora. She leaves her Aryan fascist fiancée for the amusing and loveable Guido, but just as they start to enjoy their life together, Italy becomes suffocated by the influence of Nazi power. Eventually Guido, along with their son, is captured and sent to Auschwitz. Despite her wealthy and influential background, Dora refuses to be left behind and demands a place on the death train beside them. When they reach Auschwitz, Guido desperately attempts to keep his son from being afraid by pretending that they are participating in a game to win a tank, rather than being held against their will.<br /><br />The references to the mass murder of the Jewish nation are all the more powerful through their subtlety: we are shown vans full of women driving off not to return, a group of old people and children undressing for the showers which cuts to the piles of empty clothes, and finally a smokey obscured image of the horrific pile up of corpses in the camp. The film is both beautiful and brutal and you will find yourself simultaneously laughing out loud and crying, captivated by Guido's touching attempts to keep his son safe and alive. It is a beautiful celebration of a father's love for his son and of the sacrifices and bravery that went on in order to liberate the surviving members of Auschwitz from the death camps.
B003IWRE3I|2.0|Movie moves from one depressing scene to another. Not much character development. The scenes were choppy like the camera guy was actually there but had to run before he finished filming the scene because he thought they were going to eat him.  T he book was better.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Another great book. I love the way Jack Teacher always comes to the rescue. Lots of action plus a little romance. Loved it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is definitely great and has great new features. Some people say it is much harder but I think that you should decide. PS I have second highest score of all time suckahs
0061148512|5.0|I first read The Bell Jar as a teenager and I think I missed the point a bit. Like many of the reviewers who have given it a low rating, I found Esther's character difficult to relate to and I found the plot slow and slightly tedious. However, I re-read it recently and I was blown away. Perhaps because some of my close family members have recently been through very bad bouts of depression, I found that this novel resonated on a very personal level. Plath captures the awful claustrophobia of depression perfectly, and it is made all the more sadder with the realisation that she committed suicide soon after completing the novel. Maybe a lot of people will only find the true beauty in this book when they, or someone close to them, have experienced the all-consuming despair and lethargy of going through a similarly dark period. This book has definitely been promoted to one of my favourites and I am so glad I gave it another try.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Thought it would speak more to his experience in Heaven rather than all the medical mumbo jumbo.  Waste of money
B009PEKRY6|5.0|I always love to see the Disney stars go out and do there own thing. And Bridgit is so talented! This album is amazing! It doesn't have any definable genre, and that's one thing that adds to it's awesomeness. Bridgit's voice is so unique and so powerful and the tracks are so diverse. There are some slower, emotional songs, and then there are loud party songs, and there are some that are in the middle, kind of romantic songs, too. It proves that she has so much more to come.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are Hurricane, Forgot to Laugh, 5:15, and Blonde. Definitely a great buy!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Enjoyed this book. Can't wait to read the next one. Couldn't put it down. A really great, quick read. Loved it!
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Prometheus opens with a breathtaking sequence of scenery and it remains visually stunning throughout, the aliens are not ridiculous, there is a decent amount of blood and gore and the intergalactic settings are believable. Generally the casting is pretty good: Michael Fassbender once again proved how versatile he is, playing a quirky intelligent robot, Charlize Theron is convincing as the cold ambitious commander of the ship and Noomi Rapace generally plays the lead well.<br /><br />The film unfortunately had a lot of elemental flaws, often seeming to follow a clichéd horror film rather than recapturing the originality of the first Alien film. The peripheral characters have stock roles making it clear who will die first and stupid mistakes are made, such as opening the ship's hatch to an infected team member, the captain leaving the tracking board to go and have sex when the machine has picked up the signal for an alien life form, and generally characters having a very lax approach to quarantine procedures. I think the most ridiculous moment occurs at the end of the film when Noomi and Charlize continue to run in the path of a falling space ship instead of just taking a couple of quick steps to the side and easily avoiding it...<br /><br />Having said all that, the film does fit in quite nicely with the Alien films and it definitely kept my attention throughout: the story was compelling and the 'abortion' scene was suitably disturbing. It may be no where near as good as Alien, but if you are a fan of the original films it is definitely worth watching.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I'm a stickler for quality. This thing is excellent. It's also a beast. I feel I could stab through anything.

I paid $27. Unbelievable. Buy it.

B0053B347M|3.0|This strip of LED lights installed easily on the back of my LCD monitor and the light it gives off is bright enough, but the color is a bit on the purple side, when I hoped for a white or at least a bluish hue. The USB cable is very short, so I had to attach a USB extender onto the end. After about 2 weeks the adhesive came loose and I had to scotch tape it to keep it up. I still enjoy the light, but it could be better
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is like the best game ever existed!! I used to have this game on my D's. Its not the same but it is simalar and its very addictive. It Also  remended me of the app ice age. Just because you have yo keep up with it or you get notifications and such.

B008K8X0IS|5.0|Wonderfully put-together collector's box set, combined with the flexibility of three platforms for viewing.  I didn't care about the dragon's egg when ordering, and I assumed it would be cheap, but it's actually quite well-done, considering.  Any serious lover of Game of Thrones should have this set!

B004RLPWXS|5.0|This is one of my favorite bands.  If you love Duran Duran it is a must have for your collection. Some songs have similarities to their earlier years albums.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you loved the first Temple Run, there's no doubt you will love the sequel.  Game controls remain the same, but now in a more vibrant and detailed outdoor setting, New obstacles, and an added power.  There is also a new player level system where you rank up for completing challenges.  This game is addicting and fun!  If you've never played Temple Run before, skip the first one and jump in to this new, improved version!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I  love this game, I'm just dissapointed that I can't transfer my cell phones account to my kindle. I worked hard to get all 7 of the horses I have. I really don't want to start all over. I won't uninstall it but I won't play it till that's possible. It would be nice if you added that feature.

0525421580|5.0|This is one of the better LGBT narratives out there for teens. It's enlightening without being preachy, and I love it because instead of being about \\"gay issues\\" it's about \\"teen issues\\", which actually end up being \\"life issues\\", like love and insecurity. It's funny and thoughtful and occasionally a little bit silly, which is always nice when helping to normalize the LGBT community for teens who grew up in communities like mine, where being gay wasn't talked about because no one really knew anyone who was (openly) gay.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to anyone. Period.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|the game is great but, I am running in to a lot of glitching problems for example I can not visit my allies basses or expand my land without it resetting its self.

B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft Pocket Edition overall is a very addicting and creative game. I am writing this review from the aspect of a kindle fire ( which means I play minecraft on my kindle fire not on an iPod touch, phone, etc. ) so if you are using minecraft on another device, the gameplay may be a bit different. So, let's get down to the basics, what is minecraft?<br /><br />Minecraft is basically a creation game where you build houses, create gardens/farms, hide from monster's, and mine and find objects to survive. It is highly addictive and very fun to play. The options are nearly endless for creating, with all kinds of different blocks you can use to build ( examples gold, dirt, wool, etc. ) houses, buildings, hotels, the possibilities are endless! You can plant seeds in the ground to grow crops and make your estate flourish with vegetation as well as appearance or you can use the crops in survival mode to get things. A huge part of the game is hiding from the variety of monsters at night (some stay out during the day) and also mining resources, getting wool from sheep, finding resources, and crafting things to survive your way through the world.<br />There are two different modes in minecraft : survival and creative .<br />Creative : Unlimited resources (which means you have all resources and an unlimited supply of them) you can also fly  and there is no monsters or night . No .dying, only from digging all the way to the bottom of the terrain.<br />Survival : Monsters, night, mining, crafting, not as many block options.<br />The reason I love minecraft is because I love building and creating things.I also love<br />the world seed generator  ( type in Nyan and you will get a lava world)<br />The only reason I rated it four stars is because the multiplayer mods doesn't work well on the kindle fire. Hope this was helpful! If you liked this vote it was helpful!:D<br /><br />EDIT: I think Minecraft is really awesome ... hopefully they will be coming out with 0.7.0 soon! My only complaint is the late updates. Also, thanks Mojang for SUCH a great game!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Too often we think of &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; as a children's story or a stage play.  However, it is a fine piece of &#34;grown-up&#34; literature written by one of our great classical authors, who was also an excellent critic of English society as it was in his era..
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very enjoyable and full of ways the writer could go. I really couldn't put it down.  You can never go wrong with John Grisham.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is such a great read! I wasn't sure if I would like it or not but all of the twists really kept my interest! I thought the beginning was a bit slow until all the truths start being revealed. Then everything starts making more sense and is so worth the wait! I'm sad that it's over. I would recommend this book to all of my girlfriends!
B004QX07G4|1.0|Very disappointed in this stream of consciousness book where Ellen is trying to hard to be funny and relevant.  Didn't finish it - that's how bad it was.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Was in a funny mood to begin with and this just fed on that.  Loved it.  Some sexual references so be careful with young ones.

0321885112|5.0|I have been a sketchnoter since around 2009, although I've been doodling in the margins for years prior. I wish I had this book back then to help me understand how to approach it. As a former XPLANEr, I am all about visualization of concepts and the ability to draw what you observe is very powerful.<br /><br />I like that the book wasn't all about MIke's work and he featured many other sketchnoters throughout. This showcase of different styles does a great job at showing that you can develop your own style.<br /><br />A few things I would suggest for improvement are:<br /><br />1) The orange color I found a little \\"loud\\" after a while. Perhaps a more subtle highlight color may be easier on the eyes.<br /><br />2) The font, while I get that its a book about sketchnoting, I did miss a traditional serif Times-Roman-esque font that so many other books have.<br /><br />3) The practice areas, while I can see them being very useful, I would offer these as downloadable .pdf files. The book is just too beautiful to consider writing in it!<br /><br />I am delighted this is the first book dedicated to the art of sketchnoting. The video edition is quite helpful, especially for beginners or intermediates (like myself) who want to take their sketchnotes to the next level.

B00338QENI|4.0|Although the story of Henrietta's life is very interesting, I found the descriptions of the medical side too in depth and way too lengthy. For the average reader, a little lighter on the medical history would still give a great deal of insight to the life of this woman. Still a captivating true story with rich insight to the world of medical research.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The romance was nice. The plot line was so predictable, that it was difficult to take the time to get to the end.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The last book in the Hunger Games trilogy started slow but picked up the pace about a third of the way into the book.  I was a little disappointed with the ending.
030758836X|5.0|I couldn't stop reading!  If you think you've got this book figured out...you're wrong.  That's what I loved about it; I couldn't guess what was going to happen next!  A woman is missing; there are signs of a struggle; her husband doesn't seem to have an alibi.  Who done it?  I'm not telling, and you won't be able to guess.<br /><br />There were 2 little things about this book that bothered me, though.  This won't spoil anything, and they didn't keep me from LOVING this book.  Item #1: in one of the scenes it is snowing in April...in Missouri.  Now, snow in April in Missouri is not impossible, but it is extremely rare.  The book made it seem perfectly normal that there was snow in April.  Even snow in March is uncommon in Missouri, so snow in April is a big deal.  It should have been treated as the rare occurance that it is.  Item #2:  The book mentions cicadas in a couple of places.  What's wrong with that?  Well, the book takes place in 2012.  The last time we had cicadas in Missouri was 2011.  There are two kinds of cicadas.  One kind appears every seven years, the other kind appears every thirteen years.  Either delete the cicadas, or change the year of the setting.<br /><br />Other than that, she has Missouri down cold.  It was a fabulous book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.

0316098329|5.0|This book was amazing.  It is almost impossible to come up with a truly original premise in fiction; at least, that's what I've always been told.  Well, Ms. Donohue has blown that theory all to pieces.  This is an original, entertaining, frightening, realistic, fantastic story told from the point of view of a five-year-old.<br /><br />I dabble in writing ficting myself, and I've been asked where my ideas come from by many an interested party.  It is rare for me to return the favor, though.  However, I wanna know, Ms. Donohue, WHERE DID YOU GET THE IDEA FOR THIS FABULOUS BOOK?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the game is new and so much fun. the reason why I play is because I want to go onto the mine shaft. the game couldn't get much better.

B00846F1YW|4.0|Bought for and downloaded to a Kindle Fire original - no glitches, worked well.  Also need to say that I bought both of these when they were on sale.  These are not difficult to do - but they're fun!! and if you're a newbie to these types of games - these are great to start with.  The story line is hokey as all get out - plus it's written in this sort of broken English? - but it adds to the overall fun.  Of course it could be just my own off the wall brain that found this a hoot and a half - but hey, theres bound to be a few more eccentric oldies out there like me.
B0053O89JM|5.0|I was and still am a big fan of this TV show. I know that after 8'th season there won't be anything new, but all characters will forever stay in my heart. I watched all episodes on TV, but now I can watch it over and over again any time I want.<br />HOUSE MD - THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|My mind is officially blown. Yes, its true, my fandom for Stephen King has waned in the past, been on the ropes even, but now it has risen stronger from the once supposed dead ashes. This book has now become one of my top four favorite King books. The others being Insomnia, Desperation and From a Buick 8.<br /><br />So what is it about this book that redeemed my love for King?<br /><br />I would argue that it is a combination of things. It's believable, deep and suspenseful. A good recipe of a story that leaves you wanting more but satisfied by its drive and momentum.<br /><br />From what I understand, more time travel stories are throwing out the old rules and starting fresh. This is a complete rewrite to what we've already puzzled over. A step in a new direction and I welcome that.<br /><br />Though I haven't seen films like Looper or Primer, I am told that they turn the genre on its head, offering new and exciting possibilities.<br /><br />Change the rules: simple as that.<br /><br />In King's book, an English teacher(who else?) is coming to grips from a fresh split from his wife who is an alcoholic. As he is coping he confides in his friend, Al Templeton, who owns the local diner not too far away. Al is increasingly looking older as the days pass. Al finally lets the cat out of the bag. He has found a wormhole that leads to the year 1958. The usual, believable  skepticism ensues until our hero, Jake Epping, finally decides to take the plunge.<br /><br />It's obvious that king has done a lot of research for this book. Everything from the racial divide to how much a man could live on in those days is covered. It feels like you are transported to that era.<br /><br />Al eventually convinces Jake to change the course of history by saying he should go back and stop the assassination of JFK. A noble cause but not without its strife's.<br /><br />Turns out that the past itself is its own character in this novel. It is a stubborn, angry, bullying think which does not want to be changed. Sometimes it is referred to as a \\"machine with jagged teeth.\\" Frequently it throws unfortunate coincidences in front of our hero.

B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|Not a musician so any not so great results of this app are purely due to me!!  Had some fun with it and it makes me pay more attention to the music am hearing.  Would consider other apps of this type with tunes appropriate to any season or time (can only take so much xmas music and definitely not an all year diet of).  Well worth the price - a great app!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a good game so far. needs more ways to get more money and faster energy bar. but the graphics are amazing and nicely done quests
0307346617|5.0|To be honest, I wouldn't call myself a lover of zombie fiction. But I'm not a hater either.<br /><br />For me I'm not attracted to the gore or disgust factor. When I read something, I want it to engage me. I want my curiosity to go into overload. I've always been drawn to a certain genre which I think zombies fall under: Survival Horror.<br /><br />Then a couple days ago, I decided to rent a copy of World War Z, expecting the same old stuff. What I got was an eye-opener. As the book's subtitle says, the story is meant to be \\"an oral history of the zombie war\\" and boy, does it deliver. I can't believe its taken six years to finally pick up this one book.<br /><br />This book is made popular by the fact that it accomplishes a thorough narrative while still being compelling. In it, a man responsible for writing the United Nations Post War Commission is dismayed by the fact that the government left out a lot of the personal stories. They just wanted to collect the facts. So, in an effort to tell the human side of the zombie war, the man compiles this document of one-on-one personal stories, interviews and narratives. They vary and are rich in detail as well as personal thoughts and struggles.<br /><br />The war has been over for about a decade but the scars still run deep. Through these characters we found out how life really was in those times. The origin of the infection is documented as well as the social, government, military, economic, and environmental effect of the growing plague.<br /><br />New weapons and armor had to be invented, governments were scrambling to contain the threat, people had to use their wits to outmaneuver the \\"zacks\\" - i.e. what they call the zombies.<br /><br />This is such a unique take on the genre, focusing on the survivors and have them tell it in their own words. It gives the words weight and paints a lucid picture.<br /><br />A Great read.
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|If you don't complete certain parts, you have to keep starting over - sorry, but this just wore me out.  No. 1 guys - I am not giving these games my total and unmitigated attention!! I'm playing them during commericials, while I'm cooking, waiting for an appointment, etc. - I may HAVE to stop or my attention may be diverted between a couple of things.  Having to go back and redo everything because YOU don't like where I stopped is not a good way to get me to come back and play more of your games!!!  Having said all of that - this really is a shame cause I was enjoying the game!  It downloaded without a glitch and was working well on my Kindle Fire original.  I was enjoying the different puzzles etc. - and some of them were real stumpers but not impossible - which I loved!!! but having to redo everything every time my mind couldn't completely give itself over to a puzzle that second OR because I had to put the game aside to rejoin the real world - I don't think so.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|This movie has intrigue, suspense, romance, and musical entertainment. What more could you ask for? You do know how it is going to turn out, so it's not as suspenseful as it could be, but overall, it's a very enjoyable movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm not shure aether or not to like it cause I think I love it idk let me play it more and I will reveiw more tomarrow. buy guys and galz
B00ADIT8U2|1.0|As others have said - you go back and forth and back and forth with no rhyme or reason - the games are repetive and if they were actual arcade games I'ld kick them.  You have to press and press and touch over and over to get most of it to work.  Lawsie - if I didn't have a stylus, would have to clean my screen constantly with this game - that's how much you have to &#34;click&#34;.  Really glad I got this for 99 cause I would probably be hot under the collar otherwise.
B002YCVX5S|4.0|Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" is a fictitious, visceral story of WW II in which a small group of American Jewish commandos led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine played by Brad Pitt turn the tables on Hitler and his Nazis. The movie is set in Paris during the German occupation. Besides Pitt, the major character is the Nazi \\"Jew Hunter\\" Hans Landa played by Austrian actor Christoph Waltz. Landa is suave, intelligent, shrewd, and deadly. Waltz does an extraordinary job of acting in portraying this difficult character.<br /><br />The movie movies swiftly and held my attention throughout its 150 minutes. The movie is violent and crude with many scenes of beatings, cuttings, and killings. It captures the brutality of the war. In the movie, while not in fact, the Nazis get a deserved and swift comeuppance. It is a movie of vengeance.<br /><br />I was engaged with this movie but found it valuable to step back and remember that it is a work of fiction. Some intelligent criticism has suggested that in this film that roles of the Nazis and the Jews has, if not been reversed, at least been somewhat equated. As in some other WW II movies, German top leadership is portrayed as consisting of buffoons. Tragically, WW II did not happen like this.<br /><br />The movie was absorbing, dark, and wrenching but not especially probing. I did not find it nearly as effective or entertaining as Tarantino's more recent movie, \\"Django Unchained\\". Christoph Waltz is oustandining in both films.<br /><br />Robin Friedman

B00B2V66VS|3.0|I have temple run on my kindle fire and It is awesome. the only downside is the quality of it is bad. also it tends to freeze up and quit A LOT. overall it is fun but its quality is better on my ipad.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This app is slightly better than the original temple run, although it has tons of lag. When it doesn't have lag it runs beautifully, so I would definitely recommend this app to anyone!
B008MM9630|5.0|This game gives you what most can't,it's relaxing and the scenery is beautiful.I was looking for something that would slow my game world down from crazy to happy,I found it in fairy farm.love this game and I think everyone should give this a try.don't go in and then leave,really try it,you will see what I am saying.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very good grapics a bit laggy but enjoyable overall needs more horse styles and types and more locations and and and and and and
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Tom Clancy's writing and have read all of his Jack Ryan adventures. This is another great addition to the collection and as a fan of writing relevant to our times it certainly wasn't a disappointment on this level.
B0099G88BE|4.0|A lot of variety here, but all good interpretations.  MP3 version, unfortunately I don't have all the details on the artists.  I'd like to know the vocalists on a few songs.
B00846REIS|5.0|Can't wait for school to be over to buy the second one. Intriguing, that you have to know what happens next!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was so glad they cane out with the sequel. this is such an addicting game. I can just sit there forever and play.
B000002TYX|5.0|Got this for my husband. He loves anything Beatles and it has all his favorite songs and then some - great
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is so much fun to play and it very addicting too!  Once you start playing you just want to increase your scores and do better and better.  I love it!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Good story of what kids go through emotionally in school.  Everyone has a story that shapes who they are today.
0792839749|5.0|Love this movie. Had never seen this as a child... Now love it as an adult. Movie is long but the story line keeps your attention
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun!!!(:<br />I love the competitions and training. I just want to know if you can change the name of your horse?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Probably one of the most funnest and best games ive played on here. big improvements like the new character views, graphics, and incredible gameplay highly recommended to get... YOU GOT MY RATE 5STARS
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It's a bit of a breakthrough in the way in which it seems to have popularized what used to be thought of as pornographic writing.<br /> The actual writing is clunky, and all that holds attention is the incessant weird sexual activity of Christian Grey,while one wonders whether any real  woman would continue to satisfy his aberrant urges,
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I read this book for the first time now, in my thirties, as it was not part of the children book list we read in Italy nor France. I really enjoyed the reading.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run was the game everybody played. Ever scence TR2 came out every body I know is playing it.  If this game is cool ( awsome) like this one, I wonder what TR3 be like. (AWSOME).
0439023521|4.0|Book Review of \\"The Hunger Games\\"<br /><br />In the Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is the main character and the story is projected through her eyes in a shattered country with 12 districts and 1 Capitol. Every year, there are the hunger games, which serve as a reminder that resistance is futile by the 12 districts. This year Katniss isn't chosen, but someone else is, and the twist is only the start of her arrangement of encounters and actions.<br />This book is very thorough and full of action. Suzanne Collins makes this book change both emotional mentality and gender stereotypes of both boys and girls, and projects resistance in a clever way. Besides having a great story and meaning, this book ends with an astonishing cliffhanger, which leaves the reader running for more.<br />I thought this book was quite interesting because I could make connections with my own life, and it wasn't difficult to connect to other books. The imagery is good too, this is because she uses things that are common in the readers life.<br />Although this book has many good points, it has a couple improvements to make. The book is mildly slow paced at places and sometimes it doesn't go through important subjects with enough detail. Also, sometimes the author doesn't get to the point, or in other words, leaves you hanging and waiting for something to happen that will never happen.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run two is hard but not too hard that it's impossible to do let alone try. I love it so much I never want to stop playing it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was impressed with this new version of Temple Run. There are a bunch of unexpected new obstacles and yes, this is more difficult than the original Temple Run. This version will take some getting used to. The first few times I played this, I immediately failed. But don't let this stop you! Once you get used to all the new elements, you are really going to like this!
B003MC5AV2|4.0|This is a great girl power book. I hope it inspires teenage girls to be true to themselves and be loyal friends to each other. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys young adult literature.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Just recently bought this backpack to hold my new 17.3&#34; laptop.  As the description shows, this bag has more than enough room for the laptop, any accessories, as well as the quick pouches and Headphone routing to keep everything secure easy to access!
B003E88TKS|5.0|Not what I expected. Pleasantly surprised. A really great movie.  Must see especially if you love George Clooney like me!
B0014ESMCY|5.0|Bill Evans was an early jazz idol of mine. This is a classic album:if style,sophistication, and elegance are to your taste this is a must.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|From beginning to end his movie kept me interested in everything there was to see. From humor, to the love story, to Tarentino's use of blood spatter, to the way he goes out with a bang from his cameo! The length of the movie is something only Tarentino can pull of because he knows how to keep it interesting.<br /><br />Go see this movie, or pre-order it. It's definitely one to own. Foxx, DiCaprio, Jackson, Johnson, and all the other great actors and actresses do a great job.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I enjoyed  this book very much. Small wonder it was made into a movie. Mr. Martel skillfully weaves his tale; his description of the main character's life as a boy made me see the world from the character's eyes. I will recommend this book to my friends.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I am enjoying coin dozer as it provides some fun and mind relaxing entertainment without any stress.  It can be mesmerizing.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|well I like games that are like this game and cooking games and animal games so I give this tame a 5star.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent reading could not put it down. Can't wait to start the other one,very exciting and love Peeta and Katniss
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great series of books.  I read them all over a long weekend.  Best scifi book I have read in a long time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the option where you can pick only games that win.  It's nothing more frustrating than going through a couple in a row and not winning.  I like at the very end when you win and the cards move around on the screen.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. Its interactive and horses are my favorite animals. However, its only 4 stars for me because sometimes when I click on the app it wont load up. Other than that its pretty great.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|This app does what it says it will do.  The only reason that it doesnt rate 5 stars is the lack of a tutorial on how to use it.  I spent about an hour learning how to do the basic functions, would have been much less if there was some information, tutorial, help file, or read me first instructions. (The Adobe PDF Reader has such a start up tutorial)  What I found most useful about the ES File Explorer was:<br />a)  Learning about the KFHD's file and folder structure<br />b)  Setting up the KFHD for receiving documents, photos, and other files in separate folders<br />c)  Moving files in the KFHD folder structure<br /><br />It would be useful to have ES or AMAZON to provide some insight as to WHAT NOT TO FIDDLE with using the ES File Explorer.  Since the ES File Explorer has access to system operating files it could be a disaster to move/delete folders or files that are part of the Kindle Fire HD operating system.  The Kindle Fire operating system should be protected by having hidden files or locked folders to prevent accidental erasure of critical operating system files.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I like this app a lot.  I wil turn this on at night before I go to bed.  I like it because you can mix your own sounds and control the volume of each independently.  I like the sleep timer also, so it doesn't run down the battery on my kindle fire.  Worth buying the upgrade to the real version, and not the free version.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app its fun and good to play especially if you love horses and want one of your own
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was totally worth it. Sometimes it is difficult to figure out how much of what items you have, but it is a small price to pay.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like how you can put in various cities and it will remember them.  Nice quick app for when you need to check weather in the morning.  Quicker than firing up my laptop or waiting for weather on the 7s on the cable tv.
B004PGAQMW|5.0|So funny and I loved it.  It's a great movie for kids because it is so funny and really cute
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett is spectacular as he pulls you into these character`s lives and makes the reader feel the hardships, everyday struggles, and emotions of world war one.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is a great show!  Heard about it from one of my co-workers.  We have watched this season over and over again.  Love the music, love the landscape, love the costumes.  Follows the book pretty closely.  Can't wait for season 2 to come available.
B00006LI4S|5.0|Another good concert I bought this one new for my collection not a bad price to pay for Pink Floyd.
B000SEGMAU|4.0|Albom is personal, honest and open as he unpacks the story of his meetings with his former professor. The book's profundity is found in its real-life nature: things embraced, promises postponed, learning received, and being open to the accidental opportunity. I wonder how this book might have been different had Albom seen the second Nightline interview and had missed the first.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is an interesting book.  Very interesting topic.  At first I was worried it would be too political for me.  It focuses much more on the time travel and the life he lives while doing this task.  I loved the ending!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is a must have for all floyd fans. If you like PH you will love this one. Buy it new if you can
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|It pushes boundaries of tv Good actors was surprised to see Jessica Lange in this type of drama also enjoyed her in 1st season
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is fun, but the music gets annoying very quickly.  You can turn it down though and just play the game without music.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|I watch this every morning ok youtube so I just had to buy it being such a floyd fan. Bought this one new too
B004EPZ034|5.0|My son loves this movie.  Got it and he hasn't stopped watching it.  Thanks so much for getting it here so fast.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I liked the storyline.  Not too bad for a picture search game.  Usually there isn't much plot for these.  Very creapy and fun
B005IQZB14|4.0|I found this book to be easy to read.  The author's story is different than anything else I have read.  I cannot imagine doing what she did. I found it to be funny, scary, and thought provoking!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I like the first book City of Bones but I like this second book more. It's more exciting and thrilling, has more depth in the story, better dialogues and narration. Really better than the first book in the series.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I like using this app better than using my kindle fire hd email program.  It's easier to move around in and see emails.  It's easy to delete and clean out junk mail box.  Very good app.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The best book I have ever read. Period. That is really all i need to say about it. Thank you
B000F8O35U|5.0|this movie is the best classic ever! its so sweet and loving and fun. i love the little mermaid. the music is good too
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I don't like alarm clocks on kindle fire hd.  Too hard to do snooze alarm in morning or to turn off alarm.
1401235166|5.0|Honestly, Fables was losing some steam for me since Fabletown was destroyed. Mister Dark was a character too powerful to be taken on like the Adversary or any other evil being before him. In the wake of a decision that tied up two storylines very nicely with equal parts excitement of devastation, Fables moves into a clear direction for its future. The Cubs have always been an interesting bunch, but we know so little about them save for Ghost and Ambrose. As we see the unfolding of a prophecy, Willingham has made it clear that the Fables story isn't over just yet. Inherit the Wind promises progress and new exciting storylines. I welcome the future of Fables with the direction laid down in this volume.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great movie for the family. my daughter loved it. its good to watch on movie nights everyone should enjoy it
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Pretty good, but I wish it would give more options like the facebook webpage.  For example, I can't figure out how to control how many posts i can see from this app.  The webpage offers to reduce the number of posts you see from a person.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Love the dark knight trilogy and this was a great way to get it.  Pre-ordered and was shipped the day it came out.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|this movie is great for family night. its funny, sweet, and creative. i can't wait till the second movie comes out
B004VMUS9G|1.0|I don't find that any alarm clocks work well on the kindle.  Too hard to turn off when it goes off in the morning.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I recommend this game 2 anyone. its really fun and awesome. I'm really glad that I downloaded it.my sister told me to get it. GET IT!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|one of the best games i have played this year. my son playes it all the time  just love it
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I really like this book.  The plot is so rich, and you never know the true nature of a character.  I have read the first three books.  I will continue reading because they are so good.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Trying to know Pinterest.  Seems like a great way to get over persons interest.  I am still catching on.  Thanks
B005KELS6Q|5.0|This cover for my Kindle Paperwhite is exactly what I was looking for. Wanted something to protect it while carrying it in my purse. Works great. Perfect size, great color! Would definitely recommend!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Awesome !!! I received the shipment in a week, the price was just right,  now I'm going to order season3 , yeah!!!!!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I would like more music selection.  How does that work?  I will be waiting for a response.Please give one. Thanks
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am waiting impatiently for number three and hoping Mr. Follett is considering a number four.  Fall of Giants carries on to Winter of the World seamlessly to the next generation and the next world war.<br />Very well organized.
B0058YPILY|5.0|My daughter loves this show. I have started getting the series for her.  I always order it through Amazon.  She doesn't get cable where she lives, so she really enjoys these.  Thank you.  Every year I get her the next set.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Clara
B007SY3CEW|5.0|This is fun but don't know cost of getting more music. again Amazon is not user friendly.  wish for help!!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It was a good read.  The suspense was killing me right to the ending with a &#34;twist&#34;  I like that kind of ending, especially if I hadn't figured it out until I read it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Seals kick ace.  Language is easy and quick to read.  Detailed information about the operation which killed UBL in Pakistan.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best game in the world!!! It is so much better than the original temple run! Temple run 2 has a huge monkey that is really fast! also you can go in a mine with a mine cart and slide through a really long mine! please get this app it is so fun!!!!!!!!!!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly has given us a much deeper character in Harry Bosch this time around.  Still the great detective but more connected to those around him.  I like the warmer Harry.  It was a good case to solve as well.  It kept moving to the end.
B00AL1ONN8|4.0|I like T.I. great music. Would purchase this CD again. I like most all the songs on this CD good to ride to.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books earn all 5 of the stars with ease!!!  I didn't want it to end.  Stop reading the reviews and get to reading I PROMISE you will not be disappointed.
B0053O89JM|5.0|The copy I got was damaged. The last disc was scratched significantly and barely functioned. Content wise it was a wonderful ending to the House MD series. I highly recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show.<br />it certainly lets you see the inside of how the posh people struggle just llike common people.
B00413QB5A|3.0|Not as exciting as his books on wars<br />Nice weaving of characters no murders and learned new information on the art world buyers,  galleries & artists<br />Surprise ending
B0093H8HXS|4.0|This processor is not replacement of the i5 or the i7, but for the price its very powerful. It doesn't have any overclocking potential but it's not needed. This CPU is also great for gaming, in respect of its price, it has a lot of power.<br /><br />If you're looking for a budget CPU that can still dish out serious prower, this is the card to get. If you don't have dedicated graphics and aren't planning on getting a graphics card, you might want to consider the HD 4000 version of this CPU.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft and now I can finally play it on my kindle, anywhere. But why doesn't red stone ore give you redstone
0425252868|5.0|I was so touched by this story.  The second world war was such a hideous event.  The hatred and evil seemed to be everywhere along with the insanity of the third reich.  Yet what happened between these two men was awe inspiring.  Was so impressed by all the research in depth.  A great read.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game fabulous graphics. I had no trouble at all accessing all areas of the carnival. Would love to see a sequel.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I cannot wait for the next one to come out. With Robert Parker's passing, Lee Child has filled the void.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I could never imagined that a free book could be so delicious! Funny! Romance at its best! Don't miss it!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob was one of the best books I have read this winter. I recommended it to male friends and two of them liked just as much as I did. Suspenseful and engaging. I could read it again even though I know &#34;who dun it.&#34;
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|at first I was stuck at the beginning even with the walkthrough; but then I read the diary all the way through and received the key to the cabinet.  After that it went faster. great graphics; but I wish it had taken longer to finish.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love John Grisham and this book is one of the best! Interesting plot! Really surprising story! Could never imagine how it would end! Don't miss it!
B001G7HKZ4|4.0|It is a wonderfully entertaining comedy, with lots of excellent acting from the whole cast.<br /><br />I have been waiting to see this movie since I saw it advertised in 2008. I was in & out of the theaters so fast I did not get to see it. I waited to see it on Netflix Streaming, but was never available, so I finally broke down an rented it. I must say that I was not disappointed. This is a hidden treasure.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I'm enjoying playing this game in my spare time. However the process to earn free gems is frustrating.  Twice now I've completed surveys or auto insurance quote requests to earn more gems and I never receive them.<br />Otherwise cute game, makes me miss my equestrian days.
B000FC1LOC|4.0|Nice book, interesting and polemic story! Made me think about it! But the end... I couldn't expect it and didn't like it! I prefer happy endings!
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|My eight year old daughter got this for her Kindle Fire.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered over $300 in CC charges this morning.  Although I had her Kindle locked down for getting new apps, I wasn't aware that &#34;in app purchases&#34; were allowed.  Luckily, Amazon gives you a one time freebie for this goof.  For any children's app to charge that kind of money goes beyond absurd and money grabbing to a place where they're obviously just preying on this type of situation.  Disgusting.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This was very interesting and held my attention all the way to the end. I end joyed the story line and the animation very must. Thank you
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I love historical romances and this one didn't disappoint me! Great characters, moving story! It captivated me from the beginning!
B006LEHOL2|5.0|This is the wonderful voice and music i fell in love with 20 years ago, strong, wild, beautiful Sinead :D
B005LAII12|5.0|Raunchy comedy at it's finest. Seth MacFarland is a genius. I didn't stop laughing.  It's a crime not to own this movie.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I love historical novels! This sequel to the Fall of Giants is as good as the first one. I'm looking forward to the next!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|one of the better point n clicks for amazon.  most others are way too unchallenging and after playing Japanese dev escape games most of the ones on amazon have been disappointing.  it is very imp. to play this one on expert or it is way to hint-y and boring.  For the &quot;confused,&quot; EVERY time a point n click game description says &quot;game allows you to buy content, &quot; it means you are dl'ing a trial.
B009RWRIKM|5.0|Last year I bought a 3D version of this film because I'd just watched Werner Herzog's \\"Cave of Forgotten Dreams\\", absolutely loved it and the write ups for this one looked great. It was, and still is one of the few 3D films designed for adult audiences. Unfortunately, I couldn't watch it on anything I own and was really bummed about it, especially since it was very expensive for a DVD.<br />Recently I saw it in 2D and within a quick 10 minutes, hit pause and looked on here. Lo and behold, a US 3D version is now available! (This IS a BluRay disk that plays on American machines...double check and make sure you're getting this one)<br />  I've never been a big dance fan, but this film has put an end to that. In 2D it is an absorbing and beautiful work of art well worth watching several times. The soundtrack is spectacular (which I bought as well), the cinematography stunning and the performances mind bendingly direct, complex and awe-inspiring.<br />I just finished watching it in 3D. Take what I just wrote, quadruple the experience and then some. It changes everything about the film. If you are familiar with and are a fan of the work of Pina Bausch, then you already know that this gem is a \\"must have\\" whether in 2D or 3D. I'm not kidding, it is almost worth going out and buying a 3D TV just for this film alone (but if you do, get one that you can use the REAL D glasses with and not the shutter type that need batteries and whatever...I LOVE my LG and it wasn't any more expensive than regular HDTVs).<br />  I don't know enough about modern dance to say that Pina Bausch is a genius, but in my opinion, as a visual thinker, she is right up there with the greatest painters of our time. Her passion for life, movement through space and time and sound is evocative, sublime and pure in every respect of the word. There is nothing phoney or pretentious going on at all here.<br />  Her dance company is phenomenal to say the least and like the best athletes and artists, they make itall look effortless. Again, not being well versed in dance, it sure looked like she knew how to find the most talented dancers from around the world and in their own words, knew how to bring out the best in each of them. I found myself moved to tears several times throughout this film just for its shear sense of joy, wonderment and at times, sadness. This is one of those works I am so glad I bought because I know that I'm going to be watching it over and over again. So far, like any great art it has only gotten better. It will be a must see for all of my friends and students alike.<br />  In a strange sense of irony, Pina passed away two days before the filming of this project began. Our loss of this magical woman is tragic to say the least, especially when wondering what incredible places she could have taken us from here. She most definately left this world a better place than it was when she came into it because of her gifts to us all. Thank you Wim Wenders for making this film and thank you Pina Bausch and company for enriching my life and soul.
055380684X|1.0|Don't waste your time or money on this book. The author mentions Darwin 4 times in the first 40 pages. If he believes the unproven Theory of Evolution, how I can believe anything he says.<br /><br />He also mentions Cro-Magnon man as fact...even Wikipedia agrees he is a fictional character.<br /><br />This author is a joke.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|one of the best books I've read in a while. If this doesn't make you laugh, cry, smile, then you're dead! ENJOY!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This game is the sequel to many angry birds applications and it introduces a new style in gaming history In Angry Birds Space, the birds are back! And they come with new powers and new enemies! The game introduces GRAVITY, yes you heard me, GRAVITY to the game. My favorite parts about the game is 1. they introduce new birds and new powers like the ice bird and its freezing powers. I recommend this game to veteran angry bird players and angry birds fans. Trust me, making this application free was the best thing that ever happened in our world.
0156012197|5.0|full  of wisdom and well worth re-reading and sharing with friends.  I always keep several books on hand for others.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This is the 3rd book in the series and a good read for those that love a twisted tale with intrigue.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Bad Piggies finally, its when you can play as the pigs that steal the eggs and make crazy contraptions. Every level is unique with their very own level design, the creators really pulled through this time. I like the sandbox where you have a bunch of materials to use in order to get as many star boxes as possible. So far, i've only seen 3 sandboxes, 2 of them is for each world and the las one isunlocked by finding all the cursed skulls in both worlds. So i recommend this application for the people who adore the pigs in angry birds and people who can build a mean machine!
0399256385|5.0|We love the spot series and my 18 month old son loves flipping the little tabs on each of the pages. They never get old. Great book!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is challenging and makes you utilize your puzzle solving skills, but not so hard that you get frustrated.  It's great!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I choose to rate this game 5 stars because its based on the original temple run. I like it when there was new mechanics in the game and new ways to use powerups. Im sure many other players would agree with me on this one. I recommend this application for temple run experts only, so if you haven't played the original temple run, then play it and return to this app.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I wasn't expecting to be drawn to this narrative as much as I was.  I am very happy that J.K. Rowling is now writing for adults, although I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed the Harry Potter series even as an adult.  I look forward to reading her future works.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This one is nice and relaxing to play with calming music.  It is also challenging enough to bring you back to play it time and time again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is very fun and a good game to play when you are bored and have nothing to do very fun
B007SNMYNS|5.0|I have tried several of the recipes and look forward to trying more of them.  Using ground nuts wheat germ to replace flour has to be healthier for everyone.  One doesn't have to be allergic to wheat gluten to see the benefits.  I highly recommend this book of recipes.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this game.  I play it almost every day.  I do wish I wouldn't run out of lives as that is a bit of an issue.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Storyline typical Nicholas Sparks. Twist at the end.  I may have to go see the movie to actually see the drama unfold.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|After watching the movie at the theatre and finding out that it was based on the novel, I quickly bought a copy for my Kindle and enjoyed the first-person narrative of the protagonist.  The only downside of reading the novel after the movie is that I already had images of the actors playing the roles in the novel--not necessarily a bad thing, since the actors (especially Emma Watson) did a fantastic job.
B003F5WOEC|5.0|This album is a must have for any alternative music lover, rich sound and great quality expected if vinyl. Double LP is worth the money, and the shipping was top notch.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I'll recommend it to everyone I like the whole series and make sure to read it it is a good book
B000UAFDP2|1.0|The Blu Ray player would freeze when loading the movie and after 15 minutes it would shut off.  I upgraded the player firmware to no avail.  After looking online I found the disk needs writable memory so I spent another 10 dollars for a memory card, plugged it in the player and it worked.  I can't believe the time I wasted trying to get this disk to play.
B009E3EY38|3.0|As a long time Zeppelin fan I just don't know how to rate this... Part of me likes some of the versions of some of the songs & part of me thinks some of the versions are just down right terrible... If I had to say what my main problem was here & there with this release it has to be with Jimmy Page's solo's in some of the songs (left me  scratching my head at some points)... I was rather impressed with Plant's vocals & although he can't hit those high notes anymore he did a terrific job as did the rest of the band especially Jason Bonham who I was very impressed with... Overall it's not bad for a bunch of guys who have definitely aged quite a bit... But Jimmy has lost the speed in those once magical fingers of his & at some points it is blatantly obvious... Also a side note after watching this video it wasn't hard to understand why these guys didn't do a tour as so many fans had wanted them to - in my opinion there was just no way they would have been able to deal with a big tour & see it all the way through at their age... I give this release 3 stars because in my opinion its just ok... I'm sure many Zeppelin fans will probably have a go at me about this but I'm being honest I have mixed feelings about this release... I don't hate it but I don't think it deserves 4 & 5 stars like some are giving it...
B007704HO6|4.0|A light and entertaining book to read.  Wonderful to see the love of an animal can help a person come out of their dark past.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|A great movie to watch! There was alot of action and we really enjoyed watching this movie. The actors did a great job.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I devoured the first 4 books. Now, I am almost at the end of the 5th and I do not know if I find all the answers. I want to know if the  silver-haired queen is still alive after flying on the back of the dragon.... and much more.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Helped me through the flu - entertaining enough.  Not great literature -writing so-so.  Not as good as top mystery writers.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I first saw the film on HBO and then I said I wanted to read the book. I did not know that it was a series.<br /><br />I loved to see how the characters are being built and how they reveal themselves chapter after chapter. To be honest, I first hated Jamie. He seemed to be a treacherous, cold-hearted bastard who would kill anyone. It took me some books to finish before I realised he has his own honour and that he keeps his word.<br /><br />I could speak forever on the characters and on the talent of the writer who makes your mind wonder between different corners of the world, from the snow in the north, to the deserts, from the sea to the mountains, from the people who eat frogs to the ones enjoying hot spices.<br /><br />I loved Dune when I was a child, because Herbert created his own world, but now I go out looking for castles, for medieval festivals. I guess that George Martin captivated my adult imagination.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love all of these books! So far have not been able to stop reading either one and get through them quickly.
B006LSZECO|1.0|It may have been praised by a lot of people. It may have been in the top for quite a while. This is why I bought it. Big mistake.<br /><br />Maybe I did not major in Literature, but I did a LOT of reading at my life, after graduating a Language high school. This book did not raise any of my interests. The plot was boring and I was not at all interested in finding out how it ended. Actually I was...I jumped directly at the last pages.<br /><br />There are other books, more captivating, that will not make you wonder through the minds of a mentally-troubled woman.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I LOVE this story! So sad that it is over...The author does an amazing job of putting you there with the subjects in the story. I'm almost afraid to see the movie, they hardly ever do justice to the written story.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great book.  I intend to read more in the series.  I hope to see more Jack Reacher movies.  I recommend the series to all of my friends.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow! Excellent book, very hard to put down. Looking forward to the other books to come, the story is amazing!
B001NHNG64|4.0|Great book but not quite as good as the first one.<br />I would like to see this as a movie
B008KOTNVA|5.0|easy and simple to use<br />good quality<br />I like it to open my laptop X230<br />It‘s the best for me
B008966SLM|5.0|Just a fantastic artist.  Great album.  Like a fine wine, his stuff just keeps getting better.  Some of the best chops out there.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have mixed feelings on this app. I love Facebook and it seems like this doesnt show all the news feeds. It seems like it doesnt show all my Facebook as when I use my computer I seem to see more on it than on Facebook app.
030758836X|5.0|When I first started to read this book I thought &#34;what is all the fuss about&#34; THEN a few pages later I understood! Not a great ending but I can smell a sequel. I would definitely recommend it.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I don't use Twitter much I like Facebook more it has more things like pictures on it . And I prefer Facebook in keeping in touch with my family and friends. Twitter is kinda boring thats why I don't use it much.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Travis is a hot hunky fighter who falls in love with a party girl, and their chemistry is off the charts.  The book did lose me about three quarters of the way through, so I put it down for a while.  The happily ever after ending was nice though.  Overall, thrilling and fun.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|One of the best games ever. It feels like your taking care of a real live horse. I suggest this game to anyone who loves horses.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is so cool I never thought there would be any thing better than the first one but I have been proven wrong for once!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved it so much on my ipod touch that I had to download it on my kindle.<br />I can`t stop playing it .
B004GTLFNW|4.0|Mark Lauren does an exceptional job of detailing the how's and why's of body weight resistance training.  This book is motivating, informational and provides an endless array of exercises to keep you fit without the need for a gym or equipment.  Other than some strange editing issues that detract from the professionalism of this book, 'You Are Your Own Gym' is a must have for your home fitness library.
0345803485|5.0|I have no idea why such bad reviews, unless they were looking for kinky porn and then was dissapointed to find out it was about love..... I loved it!!!!!
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  How do you make a dramatic movie about a guy who's in an iron lung most of the day? Well, they manage to pull it off in the true life story, 'The Sessions'. John Hawkes, known for a couple of psycho roles in 'Winter Bones' and 'Martha Macy May Marlene', magnificently transforms himself into the severely handicapped Mark O'Brien, disabled since childhood with polio and forced to live in an iron lung, except for about four hours per day. O'Brien is not technically paralyzed but his muscles are useless, and he can only move his lips and neck. He gets out of the house on a gurney, pushed by attendants working on day and night shifts.<br /><br />  'The Sessions' manages not to be maudlin or heavy handed due to the remarkable personality of O'Brien. In spite of the crushing limitations of his life, O'Brien manages to be relatively optimistic. He writes poetry and communicates with others, not expressing self-pity, but with a wry sense of humor. His confidante is Father Brendan, a liberal priest, winningly played by William H. Macy. When O'Brien informs Father Brendan that he seeks to lose his virginity by employing a sex surrogate, the good Father notes that having sex outside of marriage is a sin. But given O'Brien's situation, Father Brendan wisely adds that in this case, he believes that God can make an \\"exception\\".<br /><br />  The bulk of 'The Sessions' revolves around O'Brien's session with sex surrogate, Cheryl Cohen-Greene (professionally played by Helen Hunt). At first, O'Brien is deathly afraid of the encounters with Cohen-Greene, but she soon gets him to relax and he's able to have intercourse with her. Initially, they agree on eight sessions but cut things off after six, as Cohen-Greene finds that O'Brien is falling in love with her and her emotions are getting in the way too.<br /><br />  There are other characters that drift in and out of O'Brien's life, including Amanda, a volunteer with the disabled, who befriends O'Brien, but eventually has to move away, due to guilt feelings about not wanting to have an intimate relationship with him. One of O'Brien's attendants, Vera, also adds a great deal of texture to O'Brien's moving journey. Eventually, a woman, Susan, becomes O'Brien's partner for the rest of the five years of his life and provides him with meaningful companionship.<br /><br />  One scene that doesn't completely ring true is Cohen-Greene's husband, Josh, becoming jealous over a letter O'Brien sends her. On the plus side, the film is also not without a moment of high drama when there's a power failure and O'Brien is trapped in a non-functioning iron lung without anyone there to help him.<br /><br />  The Session's director, Ben Lewin, a polio survivor himself, lends his expertise on the subject to the production. One critic felt that the film needed to be truer to the real-life O'Brien's writings.<br /><br />  Nonetheless, due to its fine performances, 'The Sessions' appears to rise above standard TV movie fare. It's a touching story about a man whose spirit soared, despite crippling physical limitations.o befriends O'Brien, but eventually has to move away, due to guilt feelings about not wanting to have an intimate relationship with him.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. It is even better than the first, with better graphics too. I don't know what else too say. This game is amazing.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Really like the show, but the streaming stopped and started too much. Sometimes the video was out of synch with the audio.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|I think it's a good fps game but it's kinda hard to move the scope, aim, and firing and it's just that when I try to play multiplayer it just says searching.... and crashes
B008DVW7DQ|5.0|First I must confess that I find listening to a countertenor not enjoyable.  But I heard Jaroussky sing on u-tube and I really enjoyed his sound.  So I took the plunge and bought the DVD.  I really know nothing about this style of music so my judgements are purely subjective.  Listening and watching to this DVD, and I have done  many times now,  has been a joy.  Joroussky's voice is absolutely beautiful and enchanting.  The musicians that accompany him are outstanding.  The music is profound and somber, and yet, there a few laughs.  Buy this DVD it's really wonderful!
B0071BGOJC|5.0|A gripping and wonderful read, following the factual WWII timeline. If you have a passionate interest in WWII like I have, you will enjoy this book
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Hunger Games is a clear 5 star trilogy.  Clear concise writing with lots of excitement and every example of the basic human element.
B0058YPILY|5.0|One of the best TV shows ever made! 0 1 2 3 4  5 6 7 8 9 0 1
B00493E1GI|1.0|The book was insipid.  The movie was worse.  And,  I could not stop  staring at Julia Robert's obviously injected upper lip the whole time.  It looked so swollen, I wondered if she was suffering an anaphylactic allergic reaction.<br />  No,  probably just ugly lip plumping injections gone bad.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my kids (6 &amp; 7) are having a lot of fun taking care of their virtual pets. they have spent many hours mucking stalls and training them for competition.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I fought for about an hour trying to do something I figured must be so simple that I just had to be doing it wrong.  No.  It's not at all easy to download a video from YouTube onto your device - unless you are using TubeMate!  TubeMate makes it incredibly easy.  Now, I wish I could remove the native YouTube app from my phone!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|started slow but builds into a very good read.  i would recommend this book to anyone. i prefer fantasy fiction and this is a little dark but fine
B009LA1QW6|4.0|Lana is a goddess. Everything by her is lovely. But I have NO IDEA why this c.d. DID NOT COME with Burning Desire. I looked it up on iTunes to see if maybe the track was a bonus on the deluxe edition, but it's just supposed to some with this regular album. Also, on Born To Die: The Paradise Edition, there is another song called The Lucky Ones that isn't on here.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|The title says it all. It's a super quick read, with great characters. The author pulls you in immediately and makes you not want to put it down!  As soon as I finished I ordered the next book because I can't wait to see the relationship develop!  Hopefully she keeps them coming in this series! I wouldn't be disappointed at all if they were a bit longer though. But so tally worth the $2.99
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|The \\"hero\\" is shot at about 10,000 times and is only hit once. The plot is very predictable, but is dumb in a lot of places. The only different thing about this movie is the villain female is better looking then the heroin. Bad guys/gals are usually ugly because we are less likely to identify with them then we are with the pretty people. See if you like a lot at shooting and beating up and reasonable special effects.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This expertly researched book  is filled with compelling characters  that capture the spirit of the era.  It s balanced and fair in its depiction of events.  It  starts slow but soon grabs hold of your imagination and sentiment  .  The historical analysis is in keeping with that of the best war college data.  I highly recommend this book.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|Really liked this dvd. I enjoy watching Lee Majors. It was a tv program originally so it was fun to watch and no bad language.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Received quickly and is an excellent season! They could have explored Sam's problem more but, it was still a fantastic job!!
B004SIP7AS|3.0|This dvd was ok but probably not for young ones as the story line would have been harder for them to follow.It was fun to watch.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Always missed most of the forst season. Sammy starts off so sweet and Dean is a blast! The way they keep you wondering about Sam through so many seasons ( & we still are) is great! This is where it starts!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Thank goodness this worked perfectly!  My Kindle Fire lives right next to wherever I am, ready to go to work day or night. So when it quit, I was devastated. One quick call to amazon, problem solved. Faulty connection. Two days later, my Kindle Fire was once again my loyal companion. Thank you, Amazon.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|The things these boys do to save each other is amazing! Everything just keeps building, and you start to see why the Dad is so worried about Sam's destiny!
B009MF56GC|4.0|Excellent seeing the icons from the past come together in an all out action free for all, e specially enjoyed Chuck Norris
B003L77GGK|5.0|I love the way this season starts! Souless Sam is so much fun! & poor Dean trying to figure out how to deal with him is really funny sometimes!
B008FVZHKO|5.0|As a late comer to Porcupine Tree, I have been purchasing their albums at a furious pace. In general, they don't have a clunker in the bunch; not one has been a regret to purchase.<br /><br />This one is special though. From top to bottom, each track is a treat. Deadwing and In Absentia were both my favorites until I got hold of this one. While the same elements are present that made those two such a success, it is clear that Steve Wilson found the right balance between dramatic rock lyricism, grunge, psychedelia, and imagery.<br /><br />For those that haven't been exposed to PT, they are so hard to define despite the numerous elements found in other bands. The first track, \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" could have been a Green Day song. The 17-minute \\"Anesthetize\\" sounds like a Pink Floyd or King Crimson mult-part composition. \\"Sleep Together\\" is a dead ringer for a Nine-Inch-Nails song. Even so, PT still has its own style and verve that is intoxicating.<br /><br />If you are a Prog Rock fan from the 70's, 80's, or the Y2k era, this is the band to listen to. I can't think of a better definition of Prog Rock than simply this band.
0307951529|3.0|I was not a fan of this book. Granted, it has a great title, a pretty good dust jacket, but the inside content is just so-so. Many of the businesses described in the book were niche markets, which is fine but many of them could only support revenues large enough to support a paycheck for the owner of close to $50k.<br /><br />The author did an ok job of \\"Selling the dream\\" of not having a paycheck and being your own boss but for me the ceiling just wasn't high enough and this book didn't seem like the stepping stone to a better life. Not a terrible read, but I would pass it up if you are on the fence.
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|I'll say it's okay, but I honestly don't recall reading this one at all. Is it a Kindle? Perhaps I didn't get it.
B0082RX1P4|5.0|I first heard about this book in a graduate school class and the rumor was Zappos would pay you $2,000 to quit after you made it through their training program. This intrigued me enough to read the book. After reading the book in less than a week I would have to place this book in the top 10% of all the books I have ever read, and can confirm the rumor was true.<br /><br />What an interesting way to keep only those employees where were truly bought into the mission of the company. The book came out in 2010 and is already showing it's age as indicated by the comment \\"There will never be another 1997\\" on page 44. After getting thorough the back story of how Tony made his fortune and took over Zappos after being somewhat of a venture capitalist was interesting, and not what I expected. I thought it was unique that the CEO was not one of the original founders. Tony made some big bets along the way to ensure the viability of the company but their Ten core principals should be at the core of most businesses. You will probably find yourself thinking \\"Yes, this is the way it should be a work\\" at least once or twice while reading this book.<br /><br />Some of the better parts of the story surround moving all their inventory to Kentucky, as well as Tony's love of Red Bull (page 75). The thing that pushes this over the top of most business books is that it really does give some insight into how unhappy Tony was, after he made his fortune, and how having a passion and a calling can make your life happier. If you really are into figuring out what would make you happy read the last chapter first. Like I stated earlier this is a great read that should be pushed up the list of nearly everyone.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|I enjoyed this movie in the theater and especially enjoyed the musicality.  That is why I wanted to have it in my video library.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Unlike the word games which I enjoy this is fast, fun and fascinating.  Great for a quick game or extended.  I highly recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved the original. This game is even better. It is much more challenging. I love the extra features in this game.
B009KKLQKO|3.0|This is simply a teaser especially for those that didn't see the concert live.But it's great and sets up the real deal. I saw it in Phoenix AZ and it was taped entirely by PBS - so you know what's coming - a PBS pledge drive that will last for hours. The actual concert in Phoenix was taped in a relatively small venue (20,000) and they sang more than 50 songs. It was fantasic. They had a huge back-up entourage playing with them that produced the best \\"Beach Boys\\" sound I have ever heard. Even my 35 year old son was blown away.<br /><br />Secondarily, I was told that one of the concerts was taped in England and that would be coming out as well. Their problem is that there's a lot of pirated stuff out there so they best get to commercial release fairly soon. I suspect that this Spring is the target date.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is a great app like really great ya ya ya its great from g to the r to the eat its great jya ya ya

B00AREIAI8|5.0|i think its cool haveing to take care of a horse without having it die on you so i recommend getting this app so you can see how fun it is to have
B008D28HYS|4.0|I purchased this app as a free download on my Kindle Fire. When I first tried it I found the instructions a little confusing and didn't know what I was really doing. I stuck with it though and as I worked my way through the early levels I found it became clearer what I need to do. I know love the app and find myself staying up late just to complete one last puzzle.<br /><br />I found if you stick with this app you will thoroughly enjoy it. It's a great feeling when suddenly all the random coloured squares turn into a picture.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen did a wonderful job with book. All the twist & turns, the adventure never slowed down. I loved this book & wished it  would never end. Continue with your talent & write write write, I know I will be waiting for anything you publish.
B004I744AS|5.0|Great app and simple. I would recommend this app to all my friends and family. It's more than a dictionary it has other info connected to it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a really cool app! you can care for your very own horse, train it, feed it, clean it, and take it to competitions. its a tiny bit slow at first because you need to unlock a couple things but after a day, I garuntee you will be hooked!
140123755X|3.0|Prior to the end of the \\"Mr. Dark\\" story arc, I would have said that Fables is one of my favorite comic series out there.  It was truly amazing story telling.  Since then, however, it has really gone down hill.  As of this writing, I have read all of the main Fable comics (through vol 123).  The Adversary was an awesome bad guy that kept the story going, and Mister Dark was an even more interesting villain.  Since then, there has been what seems like at least a dozen Fables volumes where the story has just gone stale.  This story NEEDS a good bad guy.  I very much hope the writers of Fables are able to fix these tales.  I am quickly becoming bored with them.
B0085W09ME|5.0|Easiest app I have found for finding prices on air tickets. Presents several months of available ticket prices by day. Simply select your price and you are directed to the airline's site for purchase.
0545265355|5.0|This was a great deal.  The books were very good and the price was great!  They arrived quickly and it was easier than going to the store.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|Neil Gaiman is an amazing writer who always seems to be at his best. This is my favorite story he has written other than The Sandman books.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|As usual with Grisham the story line has many turns and twists with a great ending.<br />Occasionally the descriptive sections get a bit tedious but that is not a massive problem.<br />I enjoyed the book.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Simply Put ...The Best Show Ever Made!!!Sucks this is gonna be the last season.Spartacus, gannicus ,and crixus are epic characters!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a game you can&#34; put down.  I will not turn it on unless I have at least two free hours.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great graphics and very fun i love it and hope u do 2<br />much better than the last one, i like the big monkey that chases you. but there r less people 2 choose from u can only get guy dangerous, Scarlett fox, barry bones and karma lee.<br /> BUT U WILL ALL LIKE IT OR ELSE
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|I purchased both the book and the movie due to my interest in Mr. Pattinson's involvement. I had never been a huge Cronenberg fan, but I have to say that his spot-on screenplay, coupled with Mr. Pattinson's portrayal of Eric Packer was magnificent. The story is very eclectic and requires significant attention to the story's dialogue, but it packs a serious punch! It's ironic that Mr. DeLillio wrote his book 10 years ago, because his depiction of capitalism (and mind you, I am a strong believer in capitalism) is eerily similar to what we are seeing on Wall Street today -- young millionaires and billionaires who have no concept (or cares) as to how their unmitigated greed affects others. In my humble opinion, the conversation between Packer and his &#34;minister of philosophy&#34; is the key to the whole story. If nothing else, this story will enable  much conversation and debate amongst friends. I see a great on-screen future for Mr. Pattinson, and I eagerly await more from Mr. Cronenberg.
B00A6I87UQ|3.0|A useful and very good attempt at reproducing the sky chart. The resolution of the images, however, needs to be improved.
B0014U4X3U|5.0|Jane Austen-what more can I say? Great set of books-would highly recommend to anyone. Makes you believe in love again!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of those rare combinations of pomp, circumstance and downright fun. It brilliantly captures the lives of two very different, but intertwined classes of people during an era marked by profound changes in England and throughout the world. A true \\"must see!\\"
B003F3PMYI|5.0|I've been a fan of Sean Achor's since I saw his 1 Day University presentation several years ago.  Despite it being pitched as a business book ANY PERSON can get true value out of the tools and tips he presents.  The book is also entirely enjoyable to read.  He has a sense of humor and is very clear and concise for those that aren't psychology gurus.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|it is an awsome game for $.99 cents so much you can do has cool unlock that halp you out and 3 diffrent lvls of play.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|When the 3rd movie was released, I purchased this trilogy for a few mere dollars more.  Much better deal when you realize you get all 3 movies plus extras!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so much fun, loading problems but not enough to make me stop playing. lots of options and activities. great graphics.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|My computer tech was fixing my computer and put this on my Kindle to check signal strength around the retirement home where I live.
B0083Z614S|5.0|It was a good book but at some parts slow. I loved it so so so much. It had a good moral. It was one of the best book ever
0307387178|5.0|This book influenced my life tremendously and changed the way I think about living in this modern world. Alexander Supertramp was a true pioneer of adventure and decided that there wasn't enough depth in everyday life to satisfy his needs. His solution: take the journey of a lifetime by going off into the wilderness penniless and open minded.<br /><br />Jon Krakauer does an excellent job outlining Alex's life along with telling the tale of Alex's adventure. He transitions back and forth from Alex's life before the adventure including interviews with his family to telling the raw facts about Alex's travels. Because of the fact that Alex kept a journal during his travels, Krakauer is able to provide insights into Alex's mind which help to get an idea of just who this Alexander Supertramp was.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read this instead of watching the movie. You'll get a lot more respect for the story and in the end it will make you appreciate Alex much more. Well worth the few hours it takes to read.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Really gives an insight of the mind in a Soviet dictatorship. I knew what went on in the Soviet Unionen but never understodd what the people actually lived through during Stalin.
B000KXZ8YU|5.0|In California in the 60's the hippie culture was just beginning to take form, and at the forefront of that was Jack Kerouac and his entourage of friends, the original beatniks. During this phase of Jack's life he was becoming very spiritual, as were his friends around them. This resulted in an outstandingly beautiful outlook on life and they live the exact life they want to. Drinking and partying and going on adventures throughout California.<br /><br />Jack Kerouac was one of the most brilliant minds of his generation and here in Dharma Bums he brings you right in for the ride. Offering hilarious stories about him and his friends, this book shows Jack as he is just stepping into his prime.<br /><br />While On the Road tells the tale of Neal Cassady and Jack, the focus in Dharma Bums is directly on Jack. In particular it is focus on his spiritual awakening and development. Although, I must say, he doesn't become the most holy person in the world, he does acquire quite the spectacular outlook on life. Here he invites you into that wonderful mind of his and lets you ride with him.<br /><br />His writing style here is flawless and provides a fine illustration of his life. Dharma Bums will have you laughing out loud at the outrageous antics of Jack and his friends, then it will have you thinking deeply about the truths of life. This short little book is a literary masterpiece and is well worth the read. Enjoy Jack at his finest.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a great puzzle adventure game! Makes you think while having a great story to go with it. I love that they give an alternative to the Hidden Object game. I enjoy hidden object but it can be difficult to see sometimes on my smartphone. Also nice as a change of pace. I really enjoyed this game and look forward to more!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|well to start off half the time I try to play it it wont start up and it wont load. and if is too hard to her gems.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good way to unwind and still use your mind.  Did not like the ads popping up everytime I dealt a new hand.  The ads were also hard to close to move on to the game.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|What can one say?  It's Branagh.  The cast is phenomenal, and the presentation is everything you can expect, and more.  Well played! I have several versions of Hamelt, but this may well be my favorite. Well played!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app . I was soo excited when I first played it . They should make Temple Run 3!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A wonderfully happy, sad, frustrating book about unlikely love. I was hooked and can't wait to see the movie. It's so refreshing to read a true love story, and not some formulaic romance.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is amazing. it is way better than the first one. it has better traffics and has more things into detail and I love how when u die u can come back to life with gems.
B00B2DSK06|1.0|you rotten lying bums. you advertised \\"Amazon Instant Video\\" and we can't watch this now after paying for it. You should be boycotted and sued for false advertising. I have eight kids watching me and typing this in HD. They are all laughing at you. All together boys: \\"WE HATE YOU!!!\\" I am asking for my money back tomorrow morning. You liars.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The G5 games are great. Love the graphics. They give you enough to know if you want to unlock it.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|My daughter and I were always huge fans. We faithfully watched the series every Sunday night and saw the film in the theatre. This set includes extra footage. We both liked this film version as it tied up all the storylines well. It was enjoyable and a nice ending to the lives of Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda. The studio should have stopped after this film.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|looks a little too easy, but don't let that fool you! levels get tougher, require more planning. worth taking a look at for sure.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game. I really like it, except there should be an easier way to get gems. The graphics are very realistic.
B00B19DMUE|3.0|This movie has creepiness for sure.  The possessed daughter is OUTSTANDING.  There were a few scenes, and lines in particular, that really crawled my skin.  However, as many other reviews stated, the climactic part of the movie really kinda died.  The relationships kinda vanish and the creepiness factor really falls away.  In fact, they went for a kind of monster movie ending and left the creepy part behind.  Too bad.<br /><br />A different movie could've been 5-stars.  This one, I give 3-stars.  Definitely worth a watch, but it won't completely grip your soul at the end.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|It was a joy seeing these again and adding them to my collection.  I think there could have been more and better extra's, but otherwise, a great get.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I love friends and this is the best series box.  It comes with a book about the show and all of the discs have quizzes and extra features.  They also have a gag real at the end of each season which is hilarious!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|As advertised the movie's are great to have as a historical keepsake of the show.  My daughter loves the series
B00999DFP0|5.0|Got here reasonably fast, pretty cheap. I was suspicious because of the name and the low price if they were just copies on blank discs because it has happened before
B007XWFZSA|5.0|If you are planning to interview for top management consulting firms (McKinsey, BCG, Bain etc,) you need this book, it's gonna make your life so much easier and hopefully your interview outcome more predictable. it's not a copycat of other methods, this one DOES work.

B0000025KI|4.0|As noted above the CD cam in good shape and is a good album of songs.  Relative to Springsteen's others perhaps not the best as there a lot that sound repetitive, but that is not the seller's fault.  THis is the album I ordered and the seller did a great job getting ti to me
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Quick and acurrate. Who could ask for anything more?  Why would you go anywhere else. Do business with them today.
B000002513|5.0|CD was in great shape and came n time thanks to the seller.  SOngs are excellent though sometimes the production could have been better (Incident on 57th Street, which is a strong song, sounds a bit tinny). But I am very glad to have this in my collection now

B00AYB0SX4|4.0|I am a horror movie fanatic, I have seen some of the worst movies ever made, that said this movie was not horrible but it left a lot to be desired as far as back story. Some great twists that I did not see coming and some red herring clues that left me scratching my head. All in all not too bad.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|From page one you will be in love with the characters. Extremely well written and a powerful love story. Sometimes in life you are truly connected despite distance, time, and circumstances. Strong recommendation from this reader.
B005Y1B3Q0|5.0|An excellent movie to begin with, but the extended footage really added a lot to the story.  I was pleased with the quality of the recording and the extra feature are varied and interesting.  Wish I could have seen this version on the big screen.

B004G6009U|4.0|One of the better animated films out there.  The animation is sharp, precise and vivid.  The voice over work is &#34;spot on&#34;.  The story is a little different but that makes it more interesting.  Definitely not the same old story.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|A mum (40) and daughter (10) both loved this movie. The storyline, the songs, the humor, 5 stars. This movie will be watched over and over and over again. It will join Grease and Mamma Mia in the favorite movies for mommy and me nights.
B00003CX97|5.0|It didn't win all those Oscars for being bad.  A true war film displaying the mind games and psychological trials that combat troops and POW's endure. It is still one of my all time favorites.  Something that can be watched over and over and never gets tedious.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It has the best graphics!!! Plus it has every fun obstacles including when you are in the tunnel in a mine cart!! Well done fore temple run 2!!!!!
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Although it seems strange when you first hear it, you quickly feel the rhythms and understand her lyrics...yet another fantastic album!

B005NKIQ26|5.0|I love Christmas music, so it was great to get a new twist on some of the songs with Justin Bieber's renditions! I thought my teenage daughter might enjoy Christmas music more if he was singing them.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|you really get sucked in. i read all three in less than a week. this book is  the one that gets you hooked
1423124111|5.0|My nephew is a fan of everything/anything Disney -- he loved this book!<br />Poster art through the years at different Walt Disney Parks was a great Christmas gift!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This was definitely worth a read.  The prose was witty and made me laugh.  The story was heartbreaking and the characters easy to fall in love with.  Non-the-less it was a Jane Austen plot - rich man - poor girl pygmalian ending. Oh well, we love those stories!
B003INBNXO|5.0|Based on a real person. Great story about the man that brought Wing Chung Kung Fu to the masses.  I didn't get a real good feel for how much was fact over fiction as far as the story went but over all excellent film.
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is a must read for every one!  Beautiflly written, and the narrative as unique as the author herself.
B0011Z52EW|5.0|Had all the My Chem CDs on my ipod until it broke last summer and didn't have all my music backed up. So had to buy it one more time. Famous Last Words is one of my all time favorite songs!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great game to pass the time. WARNING: once you get started, it's hard to stop!! It is a great, carefree game!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game. Better than the first one. I play it all day and try to beat my friends scores.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It is rare enough to have a woman for a hero, especially a woman without a gun, a woman who is a physicist, an astronomer and an agnostic, but who has all the courage in the universe.<br /><br />This is a film that looks great, with the most amazing opening sequence ever, a universe-wide pullback shot ending up in the pupil of a young girl's eye. It looks even better in bluray.<br /><br />The price is right, too.
B00009W0U4|1.0|This movie is disturbing on so many levels, and the graphic 11 minute scene is horrifying! I hate this movie
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best movie ever made. For years, however, it was impossible to get a really good copy of it to watch at home.<br /><br />While nothing compares to seeing this (as I have) projected with a 70mm projector on a 50-foot-wide screen and listening to it through a TXH-certified sound system, this bluray is as close as you can get to that experience in home use.<br /><br />I don't have a real top of the line setup, but I do have a big screen, an HD projector and a 5.1 surround sound setup in my basement where I watch a lot of movies (hey, I'm a film critic, what do you expect?). This film looks and sounds great on my system.<br /><br />Previously, I owned the DVD and the Superbit versions of this movie, but this new bluray is a big improvement. Every 70mm frame of this film was scanned in at 8K. A lot of software regrading was done to fix problems with the film due to deterioration of the original prints over the years.<br /><br />But the technical problems with this film actually go back to the original negatives, some of which were damaged by extreme heat during filming in Middle Eastern deserts. Many of these problems have been fixed in this new bluray release, which even goes beyond the original, very extensive restoration of the film.<br /><br />The restoration of this magnificent film was a labor of love. It is an amazing achievement. This film is worth that kind of effort. Most people will never know how close we came to losing this cinematic treasure.<br /><br />A top-of-the line presentation of this these days would incorporate an ultra-high-definition projector (4K) a great big screen and a top-of-the-line surround sound system. This disk comes with 5.1 DTS Master Audio, which is a superior uncompressed audio stream.<br /><br />This is a very long movie, but it does come with a built-in intermission (complete with music, some of which is also heard in the opening musical sequence).<br /><br />They don't make movies like this anymore. Even when they were making movies like this, years ago, very few of them come even come remotely close to the standard this film set.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|awesome game - but  hard - I used the hint a lot! some puzzles were hard but most  easy - it did take a bit to download

B00B2V66VS|2.0|Temple Run 2 is by far my favorite app. I am completely addicted to it. But, after a few hours or so of playing it, it unexpectedly crashed. I tried opening it again and it refused to get past the opening screen. I deleted and re-downloaded it. it worked for a little while, then did the same thing. I hope that Imangi Studios can work on an update to fix the problem.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is a little annoying because of the adds but without the adds I love the game

B0058BI896|5.0|This tv show is completely hilarious!  Love it!  Witty and full of interesting characters.  Jim Parsons is a comedic genius.
B004UXUX7S|4.0|This was a good movie, but it was a little to drawn out in parts. But yet a heart warming movie. George Clooney was pretty good in this move.

B0086700CM|4.0|I enjoyed Temple Run. The game was fast paced and the farther along you got the more challenging it was.
B009VB97EY|1.0|I bought this to give a friend for her birthday.  She is in love with Joe Manganiello and I knew he was in it.  Plus EW Magainze had given it a great review.  I am sad to say, it was terrible.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addicting. I very much enjoy playing this game and intruduced my wife to this game and she cannot stop playing the game. If you start playing this game be prepared to play for a long time.
B000EWBKKI|4.0|I use movies for language study and was very disappointed this does not have spanish audio. Bluray format can hold an incredible amount of data and audio dubbing doesnt take a ton of room. Some dvds include German, Spanish, French, Italian and Japanese. :(
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Well made apps for multiple devices with data in the, makes it very handy when you have a number of computers and devices. Conflict resolution could be improved and better support for checkboxes on Android would push it to 5 stars.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|LCould have better tiles or be able to change them. But very challenging. Woulld also be nicer if could see tiles better but may well be my phonr
0062209493|4.0|If you are interested in books about or by military servicemen, then you will find this book by a SEAL sniper interesting.  The content was fine, my problem was with the reader of the audiobook.  He had a deliberate overdone southern accent (presumably because the author is from Texas) with bad acting skills.  I would have preferred a simpler, cleaner read without the dropped g's.<br />Also, on the audiobook it was hard to tell where the chapters written by the soldier/author ended and those written from the perspective of his wife began and ended, as they were all read by the same audioreader, a man.  This was confusing.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I've been playing this game for almost a yr now it suddenly reset causing. me to have to start over losing everything now the game will not allow you to visit or add neighbors...... kindle fire version
075666733X|4.0|A good book for lay people (missing details a professional would need) but the book is huge and heavy, not for the overhead compartment!
B003521R6G|4.0|Love this movie!  The new one is good too, but being a child of the 80's. I love this one!  And Kevin Bacon's solo dance is the best!
1611761565|4.0|There is more to the book than the Bin Laden story, e.g., if you are a lay person interested in some basic SEAL background and training.  The book is a little disorganized and could use some editing, but is overall a good read and the audiobook is also read well. The author stated that most of the procedes go to SEAL support non-profits.<br />If you want a lot of  details on special forces or SEAL training, then there are better books for that.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE this game! Its awesomely fun a really addictive! GET THIS GAME!!!! I love how they created a seperate game. Super fun
B002ZG98UK|4.0|Resident Evil: Afterlife is a great movie...now it's even greater with Blu-ray 3D.  The only bad thing is the price... at $30 it's running a little steep for most people. If you like 3D then this is a movie for you
1582701709|2.0|matthew 6:22-24 (NASB)<br />  22\\"The eye is the lamp of the body; so then if your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light.23\\"But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!<br /><br />  24\\"No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.<br /><br />To illustrate the results of right and wrong attitudes to material things, Jesus referred to a local belief about the results of good and bad eyesight. People believed that eyes were like windows that allowed light to enter the body and keep it in good health. Healthy eyes meant a healthy body (light); diseased eyes meant a diseased body (darkness). A healthy view of material things will result in a healthy spiritual life; but an unhealthy view will mean that the natural spiritual darkness already in the heart will become even darker (Matt 6:22, 23). A person can be a slave of only one master at a time. If people devote their attention to increasing their prosperity and comfort, they can no longer claim to be loyal to God (Matt 6:24).<br /><br />Be positive, Be happy, Believe. Be Careful.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|About 40% into the book, I could not put it down!  I just kept thinking how this was the BEST book I've read in a long time.<br />By the end of the book, I had a tears in my eyes and hope in my heart.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|My kids love the diary of a wimpy kid books.  They have read them over and over again and never get sick of them.
B006LSZECO|5.0|One surprise after another in a completely engrossing novel.  Don't miss this one!  You'll definitely become a Gillian Flynn fan.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies-I could watch it every day.  The blu-ray copy is great.  Anyone looking for a great family movie should get it.
B0093X80VQ|5.0|I got the kindle version of this book and I love this book. I read it as a little girl, and reading it now I'm still in love. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an okay book, but this book really takes the cake.
B000286RNY|5.0|Stephen Chow does it again, just when I thought Kung Fu Hustle couldn't be topped I ran into Shaolin Soccer. This movie had me crying with laughter with its zany antics. The action scene are just as crazy and over the top as you could hope. Can't wait for Mr. Chow next project.
B0093WVND4|5.0|One of my favorite Roald Dahl books! I just love his writing, and I recommend it to both adults and children alike!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This review is coming from a kindle fire user!:) I love this app! It is a great sequel and has NO glitches or bugs included! My friend and I play this game every weekend and also have comoetitions I think that everyone will enjoy this app. :) Have fun running
B0051GOB26|5.0|I bought this for my husband out of no where and he loves it.<br />The only thing you should know is that the book is attached to the case. You can't pull it out, but flipping the pages isn't hard.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is the best show on television. The talent and production values as well as the supurb writing of every episode sets the bar for others to achieve. Although I am a fan of Celtic fantasy and history, I feel any lay viewer will find the storytelling, character development, action and sensuality top shelf.
B0093X805W|5.0|While I do like the sequel (Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator) better, you can't beat this classic story of the underdog and his trials.
B0087EACJK|5.0|Nice to see this fun game as FAOTD. Don't let the stickman graphics fool you: this game is fluid and fun. There's some tile-swapping strategy, and a little touch of dexterity involved in this game. I've never been a fan of 'tilt the tablet/phone' games, but this is an exception. You get to freeze the action before you turn your device over, then un-freeze when you're ready to let the guy drop.<br /><br />The first few levels seemed pretty tame, but then the game got more maze-like and upside-down. Whoa. I don't think I've finished one board in the 'award time', but I'm having fun getting all of the coins and figuring out how to reach the exit. Looking forward to more levels or a sequel.
0307957837|5.0|I bought this as a gift, and it was easy to wrap and give. It's heavy, but that's okay. I really hope she likes it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it has a zip line and and a whole lot of fun.  I got it because it has a big fat monkey chasing you
B0096HFOZO|5.0|This book is hilarious. I read it every time I need a good pick-me-up. I'm glad I got the kindle version, as my real life copy is falling apart.
B00005LOUQ|4.0|Loved the story when I read it to my kids when they were younger.  When it came out in a film, I was very impressed with the performances in it.  Very suitable for young kids
B0071XO8RA|3.0|It sort of grows on you.We listened to the audio book and had fun talking like the characters..Saw a sign on the road ...Cleaner...and got out of town
B002BWP49C|4.0|I am collecting the Twilight series for my granddaughters, and myself as well.  I am a hopeless romantic and enjoy watching romantic movies, but the violence is a bit overwhelming for my granddaughters at this time.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|on the kindle fire it has some glitches like every time I play I have to take the tutorial and everytime I die I have to exit the game and open it up again. other than that it is awesome!!!
B005LAII0I|1.0|I do not have this product.  I never ordered it.  So how can I rate it when I haven't even seen it
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Thor was the best action/comic book hero movie i've seen in a really long time. The graphics were awesome! I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I have always been a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works.  I especially love the Sherlock Holmes series.  This one has an interested end suggesting that there may be another one.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|i am an 11 year old who loves books.i read the sample and am trying to get my dad to get it for me.this book is for every one.easy to read.good book for ar points.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|This is a great adventure laced with American history which is true.  Any adventure lover will enjoy this flick and others like it. A bit short of Indiana Jones series with Harrison Ford and The Mummy series with Brandon Frazier. Has a great story line
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the Game ive been waiting for!!<br />Awesome and good in graphics.It is awesome in gameplay.its like rp except you control the NPCs.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|When I saw this on PBS for the first time, I was automatically drawn to it.  I love music and found Celtic Woman to be very interesting as well as very pleasant to listen to.  You will enjoy it no matter what your background is.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was very interesting and exciting. I really liked the adventure.  It kept my attention. I liked the love segment.
B000I5X81K|4.0|Absolutely love his music.  He is a joy to listen to and has the voice of an angel.  You can help but love his music.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|I gave this excellent account a full five star rating because of it's well researched attention to facts and their details and their documentation.  I would highly recommend this great book to any serious history buff and any person who just wants to know the truth about matters of the world and especially how they were influenced by and related to the actions of those high in the United States.  I think this should be a required book on the reading list of every serious high school student, college student and American who loves to read about the real, often hidden truth relating to matters that should concern and do affect all of us.  Of course, I love history and the often un-disclosed truth behind it.  A great read!
B00133KFGW|5.0|I love this movie not only for the music, but for the story ov how powerful music can be in our lives.  It is the common factor that makes all of us human and connected in ways that no one else or influence can or ever will.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grishom weaves another masterpiece.  You won't figure this one out until very late in the book.  This is the type of story that made the author famous.  I call it a comfort read suited for the beach, the plane, everywhere.  you won't want to put it down.
B0042MEQVG|4.0|This one is added to my twilight saga films.  Can not wait for the last one to come out in DVD so I can watch it
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I've been waiting for this to come out for 5 years.  It was worth the wait.  Led Zeppelin is as tight as ever.  It sounds just like the did in the late 1970's.<br /><br />A great bargain for 2 DVD's and 2 CD's
B001KZG99A|5.0|I was quite impressed with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man. The whole cast did a great job as well. I enjoyed the special effects and pace of the film.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I love the way it feels when you have it open for use. Great product for a great price. Awesome!
0385535147|1.0|Grisham's latest is worse than the previous couple of books.  I stopped buying his books a while ago and went to the library instead, glad i didnt spend a dime.<br />The first half was entertaining, but should have ended with the capture of Quinn.  After that, it gets rushed with new characters that come out of nowhere and make no sense. Disappointed again.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|constant crashes. m points are a scam, more than 1/2 the time there is an error. weather forecast is usually wrong. errors prevent most videos from loading. what is going on weather channel?
034580404X|3.0|I have lived a long, long time and this story does not shock or surprise me.  I have known some of these people.<br /> However, I would not leave these books for my family to read. I have known people who consistently use the &#34;F&#34; word but it still offends me.  The dialogue seem to have used it to express feelings about every situation and emotion these characters experienced.  Perhaps the literary world has gone on without me but these are supposedly educated and intelligent people who must have been capable of expressing themselves in, at least, a few more appropriate ways.<br /><br />The story depicts obsecession and sexual behaviour that has certainly filled volumes of like stories.  It was comforting to see that it all turned out well and that even fictional humans are capable of change.<br /><br />I wonder if they stopped using the &#34;F&#34; word around the children!!!!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I finished this book in 3 days it was the best book ever<br />Now it's time for the 2nd book! Yeah!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|These women are beautiful  and talented. The accompanying music is spectacular<br /><br />Being able to play these concerts over and over and to share them with family and friends if delightful.<br /><br />.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|You a fan of Sherlock Holmes this movie will just keep wanting more and more of Sherlock. It was great blue-ray quality and that always puts a smile on my face.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Avatar is the definitive 3D feature film. I'm only sorry I had to wait so long to purchase a copy.
B005HP2JAM|5.0|Bought it because it was inexpensive and sounded interesting.  We have thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to others.  The cave drawings are beautiful.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|Not the life changing band you're looking for, buy decent pop rock sound and voice. Sounds a little like Train. Slightly better lyrics here though.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This was better than I expected.  Although it was a little long, it never seemed boring.  I would recommend to anyone that enjoys action flicks.  Bale makes a great Batman.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is so amazing<br /><br /> I will always connect to this story and read it again... thank you for a great story..
B001F9FLX6|5.0|This book was ordered for my husband who enjoys WW2 history.  He was very happy with the book.  He has added it to his collection and will share it with my brother who also is interested in WW2 history.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I hated seeing how fellow humans treat each others, but this is how God opens my eyes to show me who needs help and how He reminds me to be grateful . Wow
B0096Y6EUG|5.0|I have bought a seeming boatload of of Paul Simon collections and Simon and Garfunkel Best ofs (always on sale at Amazon) so many of the songs here are on my playlist in multiple versions.  This collection stands out because of Simon's maturity.  Its just such a pleasure to hear the masters go back and reinterpret their classics later in life.  Without fail, they (and I include Clapton and Dylan here as well) are technically more gifted, more nuanced of voice and both wiser and humbler in presentation.  This is not your basic Best of Paul Simon collection.  Get it. Get it now.
B000WDSZ8E|1.0|If there wasn't canned laugher after every punch line, no one would be laughing at the horrible jokes in this mess.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Chose this title for a book club selection. Should make for a good discussion. Characters well developed, writing was great, story was satisfying. Would read more books by this author.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/23/63- Highly recommend this book. A real page turner that keeps you riveted. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. Not your usual Stephen King novel
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not as great as I had hoped, but if you are into these kinds of books you might like it. I had to see what the hype was about, guess it just isnt really my thing.
B0083EW97W|4.0|I received a $5 credit for buying school books and chose this cd.  It is a great nice mix of mellow songs to keep you relaxed.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I could not wait to see this and I was not at all let down. I enjoyed it a lot.
1451638647|4.0|I find that Bujold simply cannot write a bad book. My only reason giving this one 4 stars is because it lacks the manic yet highly entertaining presence of Miles Vorkosigan. I realize that as the father of four children and married to the enchanting Ekaterine Miles simply cannot logically be placed in situations of maximum perversity where only Miles can get the plot untwisted but I miss the &#34;hyperactive little git&#34;.  That said I welcome the addition of one more novel in the Barrayar universe. This is well worth reading and deserves its place. Ivan Vorpatril has begun to mature and take responsibility at last. And, as his mother, the formidable Lady Alys Vorpatril, social doyenne of the Empire, would undoubtedly say, &#34;And it's about time!&#34;. If they ever made a movie of the Vorkosigan saga, Lady Alys would have to be played by Maggie Smith.
B0006HBERA|4.0|I especially like the set up of Orchard toys the board is composed of pieces which fit together like a puzzle. This is a fun game my only suggestion for improvement would be a slightly bigger board to fit the buses more comfortably.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app makes me not so sad about not getting a real horse<br />hdhfhdfndfndvdbdvndbd dhc hf fhfh dhdjs nfhf fdg Yggdrasil<br />AMAZING
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Enjoyed playing this game with my Grand babies.  They can beat me hands down every time.  Good graphics, fun, fun!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fun game. Great level of difficulty. I would recommend. this game to anyone.  Love love love it!!!  great fun game
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good game good graphics keeps you busy for hours on end. If you love horses you'll love this game and all it entails such as grooming treating competition and customizing your horse
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This was a great book very sad and the more you read the better it gets<br />I just loved it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fear not! Downtown Abbey remains just as interesting and well written in season 3. If this were a book, it would be a page turner. If you enjoyed the first two seasons, you won't be disappointed.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I am in the middle of reading this book. So far I find it fasinating. I believe so much in everything Dr. Alexander experienced. The fact that he's a doctor, really validates what I always believed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great for kids of all ages.  I`m 69  years young and love the game.  Seems so real I can almost feel beauty hair when I pet her.  Almost smell her also!  I had horses when I was younger and miss them very much.  I`m so glad I found this game and am able to do it.  I have arthritis in my hands so my activities are limited but I can  push buttons just fine.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this chance to relive being with my horse!  The only problem is buying the gems.  I hope to bee able to enjoy the game for a looking time. Jkpiq
B003ZSJ212|5.0|If you are a Star Wars fan, you NEED this set - it has the complete Star Wars movies in Blue-ray format - it is perfect for viewing on large screen High Definition TVs!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this thing has a rope u can use and it has a huge monster it is so big it its as big as your house or bigger
0765325950|5.0|I cannot tell you how satisfying this final book is. The waiting and then angst getting here was more than it should have been - but it was well worth it. In truth, I'm not ready for this series to be over. It was such as large part of my childhood - and now, in my adult life, I cannot wait to pass this series on to my children. It reminds us that it's ok to believe that there is a right and a wrong, that Good will triumph over evil and that all men have the ability to chose Good. I cannot thank Robert Jordan enough for creating such an unbelievable world or Brandon Sanderson for finishing it. Its worth every minute and every dollar.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great sequel to the Hunger Games. I highly suggest this book if you liked the hunger games. This book was every bit as exciting.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|Product came on time. New. No scratches or problems with the merchandise. I listen to it in the car everyday.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app!! on the go you can read the Bible whenever you want!! read read read the Bible!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Sweet, fun filled game... Can't get enough! Definitely in my top five favorite apps... Video is crisp and smooth with no lag. Great job with this one!
B001OQCV6A|3.0|It's an entertaining blockbuster film, but I still can't buy Robert Downey Jr as Sherlock. I liked the first one better, but this one has some good bits. I particularly liked the strong female gypsy character who did not become a love interest.
B000QUUD60|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen showing you what the real Elvis was like. It's funny, enjoyable and one of the best CD's to really show how talented he was, his voice levels and ranges. His band is most excellent, the entire group. WOW THE SEXIEST,most handsome and greatest entertainer ever.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my 6 year old loves this game. it doesn't steal your money either like more deceptive &quot;free&quot; games. keeps her entertained.
B000GCFD72|5.0|I'd read countless parenting books, in an attempt to find the fit for my family.  This was a tru eye opener (backed by research) into the innerworkings of child development.  I am so glad that I came across this book when I did.  It has made such a huge difference in my house (for the better).
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|for the full game. I'll have to think about it. 1.99. is. the most I. like to spend for a game. This one did not take very long to play. ???
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I do not like the screen that you are accessing Facebook.  I will stick with going on my computer.  Would much prefer having the same access as on the computer.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|The movie was great.  All of the effects were superior and definately would recommend to our friends to buy or watch.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Very picturesque!  It's nice to get all of the information where it is easy on the eyes.  Love the background!
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|The movie Men in Black 3 was not as good as the previous two. There should have been more special effects.
B002U1F32M|5.0|This movie is a perfect example of a guys version of a chick flick. Thats the best way to put it. It has a good twist and a wonderful ending.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I would give the game a 5star but my kindle has a hard time loading the game if yoou love horses this is the tam : )
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I rated this story four out of five stars because it wasn't as good as the first and second books. I love the Hunger Games trilogy. They sound so real. If you are in your tweens or higher, this is a great book for you.<br />You should read this series. I think that this book is written for tweens to adults.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|so addicting and fun plus the new features are amazing I highly reccomend this game for everyone!! just buy it!!
0880796863|5.0|Ordered for my 16-year-old daughter. She loves these cards and carries them around with her to learn and study the cards. Very nice quality. Thick cards. Good illustrations.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|An easy read and escape into the world of pro cooking.  It brings back memories of my time in kitchens.
B006LSZECO|5.0|While providing a thrilling plot that renders this book unable to put down, it's impressively balanced by the author's ability to ground the protagonists with issues with which we can all relate.  The plot moves quickly, yet within the wild story you find yourself easily relating to the protagonists' blunt narratives/perspectives.  It's exceptionally well written. I absolutely loved it and look forward to reading more from this author.
B002RI9ZQ8|2.0|have tried several times but very hard to get into story.  won't let it beat me will attempt to read again soon
B003ASLJK4|5.0|This has always been one if my favorite movies. I'm glad to have it in my collection. It's a very touching movie.
0385360169|3.0|This book would appeal more to a teenager versus an adult. Very disappointed after hearing all the hype about the book. Definitely did not live up to all the talk.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 adds an improved style of gameplay, with new obstacles, pathways that turn slightly, a minecart area (all great adventures have one), and, of course, a GIANT demon monkey. With a new 'gem' currency to purchase 'save me' which can save you from death, character specific abilities, and a new revamped temple, I could play it for quite awhile. Definitely get this app if you like the original.
B00APUYN0I|1.0|Count me as one who doesn't understand the good Rotten Tomatoes score.  This movie was terrible.  There were some great musical performances, but that was ALL this movie had going for it.  Don't waste your money or time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is just challenging enough for everyone.  With so many choices you can keep the fun going for along time
0399160450|3.0|I liked that it covered this new frontier of warfare and terrorism, but it seemed too rushed. Not terrible though.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A very emotional psychological and dramatic journey. Lots of action and lots of discovery. Love this story and how w can relate it to our lives if we aren't careful.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is fast paced and very exciting you need to download it and if it keeps kicking you back to home delete it and reinstall it
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is fun and challenging! I love it! My only problem with this game is after you run 3000m or so and you try to use more than one &quot;Save Me&quot; it force stops and closes out of the game but still takes your gem. It wouldn't be that bad but when you go to use for a third time in one run it kicks you off but still takes your gems that's a lot of gems altogether I have lost 17 gems because of this! It's a bit ridiculous! I hope you guys can fix this problem!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is way better than the first game. I think the best addition is the minecart that you can ride through tunnels. Overall it gets 5 stars
B003TQKVGU|5.0|Just the information on affirmations contained in this book will rock your world.  Lead you to new creativity and new levels in every area of life that you apply it in.  The perfect plan for the unfolding of my desires are contained in the words I speak, I speak to my subconscious which always works for me.  I create my world and existance.  This is a great book but it must be used.  Buy it, absorb it, and use it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this game pretty much my fav. hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! Jaw dropping twists and turns keep you in suspense. Each chapter offers a different characters point of view, allowing the reader a more in-depth perspective of each one. I would recommend this book to everyone!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Best price out there . If you love the walking Dead you need this 3 cd set. Comes nicely packaged.
B0015DROBO|3.0|There are many suplots that makes this a novel that does to much at once at many points. (spolier alert) Nazis,Gangsters S an M too much at onve.  However of you are in the mood for a quick read with fast paced character and plot development, go for it!
B008SVFX96|5.0|I waited for 3 1/2 mos. for this c.d. it was well worth the wait.I was frustrated because I couldn't wait to hear &#34;Sugar Daddy&#34;.My pre-order was cancelled then I got it from another seller.It arrived pretty fast.My daughter and,I both agree it doesn't sound the Richie we know&love.I love the c.d recommend to all Richie fans.<br />  Thanks,<br />Sheila L. Lance
B003TSEEDY|5.0|New favorite book.  Honestly was the best book I've read in a really long time. Finished it in two days and Im ready to read it again.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|My son was going to take  me to see when it came to theaters last December 2012 but,never got the chance so I pre-ordered it from amazon.com.Luv the movie he was great.Watch it over&over again.MUST HAVE FOR JON FANS!!!<br />  Thank you,<br />Sheila L. Lance
B0086700CM|4.0|temple run is very......how should I say......AWESOMELY AWESOME......best free thing I have bought... recommend for all ages.....had much fun with it
B003ZVJFFM|4.0|I had been putting off this purchase for a couple years. I finally gave it. I really like how they remade this classic story!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|really no review needed.... it's simple angry birds......fun that lasts....wonderful lasting levels...Blah blah nothing left to say.....Blah blah blah thanks...
B000QCQ9O8|2.0|I really didn't care for this book. So wordy. I ended up skipping large portions of the book and then seeing how it ended. Pretty much a waste of time.
B005HSL626|4.0|doesn't need a review except for the fact that all levels are free...... best buy...... all levels that you usually pay for are free.....
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Addictive and great fun.as a lorry driver it helps those long hours Sat waiting just fly by and keeps the brain working. Superb app !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the movie but the book was even better. I am on my way to purchase Catching Fire.  Definitely recommend this to others
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Enjoy this cross between history, sci fi, and commentary on  the human  conditions. Never dull and full of humor, a Vonnegut classic! Don't miss it.<br />Thanks Amazon for letting us enjoy it so. Reasonably priced.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|It's all right it took me a week to read it's pretty long as you see but it's good it told all the  stuff it could I hope you like it too!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game was awesome and entertaining, however the monsters look more like jell-o than pudding :) it keeps you busy and it makes your brain work tonfind the best possible solution.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|If you enjoy suspense, edge of your seat movies that actually have a good story line that allows for moments of humor and calm, you'll love Total Recall.<br />Both men and women equally enjoyed this flick.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A really well crafted story where you have no idea what is going to happen next. I enjoyed the characters and some of the twisted logic that they used to justify their actions.<br /><br />I know there's a prequel series to this, but I hope to read more stories set after this series.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The TV Series is both compelling and dramatically believable. It has a huge following but requires that the user purchase a subscription to HBO which includes a few other movie channels for around $18 through their cable provider.<br />I would prefer to pay a one time reasonable fee just for that series, however, the series is one of the enticements HBO uses to gain subscribers but with Netflix and Hulu along with the $1 Redbox, I refuse to pay for movies that I can get for free or as little of a $1.<br />Right now, these original series are about the only thing keeping HBO and Showtime afloat!  I think they need to rethink their monthly costs and dump whatever is no longer producing revenue. Right now the money is in successful engaging and original series. Right now HBO and Showtime have just a couple shows each with huge followings.<br /><br />I would want 3 or 4 that had me hooked to pay their monthly rate. Which explain why I can only speak for the episodes that were either free or very cheap. I normally find it if willing to wait for the the current season to end. Sometimes that is an advantage when offered through Hulu Plus because you aren't forced to wait for the next episode to be released. They're all right there.  Warning: Don't start late at night or you may be up all night!!
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I bought this for use with my PC, and it works flawlessly.<br /><br />The size and rubberized grip is just right for my large hands.
0451232852|5.0|I never liked history in school--dry dates, political & military campaigns, etc.  Nothing said about the lives of ordinary people or the motivations behind the actions of world leaders.  So needless to say, I never had any understanding of World War I.  What first caught my interest in the subject was PBS' \\"Downton Abbey\\".  \\"Fall of Giants\\" is the perfect next movement into the subject.  Mr. Follett expertly weaves in the viewpoints of people of different backgrounds and ideologies with the viewpoints of world leaders who let circumstances slip the world into a war of unfathomable carnage.  (for eg., in the final year of the war, 1918, the British had greater casualties than in all of WW!!; the major countries each lost millions of young men).  As a followup, I recommend watching \\"World War I in Color\\" if you can get it from Netlfix or another source.  I am next planning to read Barbara Tuchman's \\"Guns of August\\" to get additional background into an amazing time of change.
B000W4KSWO|5.0|This is a GREAT CD!  Duke Ellington and John Coltrain are wonderful! I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys Jazz.
B0042EJD8A|1.0|Fracknation completely shoots down every claim made by environmentalists.  Fox knew the truth and chose to hide it.  The EPA has repeatedly sampled water in everyplace where fracking is done and concluded there has been no contamination.  Naive environmentalists were used.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book has you hanging on to every word! I understand why its made so much money and how EVERYONE has been talking about this book! READ IT AND YOU WONT REGRET IT!
B0038P59A0|4.0|This interpretation of Sherlock Holmes is fun, but it isn't Jeremy Brett.  Arthur Conan Doyle is not martial arts and special effects. That said, if one puts aside the &#34;real&#34; Holmes and Watson, the movie is well done and worth seeing.
0345803485|4.0|Those who gave this book a bad review are obviously readers who can't look beyond what's written on the surface. This book depicts a few moments of erotic bliss but one has to focus less on that and look for a deeper meaning of what the writer is trying to express through this work of art. If one is to free their mind and look for a deeper meaning, they will find that they can relate this book to life itself and find that we all follow a set of rules that determine who we are as individuals. This story is about love, trust, freedom, and the boundaries or limits one is willing to take when going into any relationship. As I read this book I found that it was quite predictable and I felt as if I had written it myself, but I wouldn't consider this a bad thing. I also found myself thinking back to the movie 9 1/2 weeks and picturing Mickey Rourkes' character's devilish, mischievous but oh so sexy gaze and ways ;). I'm very much looking forward to reading the other two Fifty Shades of F***** up Mr. Grey :)
B00008WT49|5.0|I bought this album for my wife and she loves it.  Norah has a natural singing talent and a smooth and easy voice to listen to.
B009LDMJBU|5.0|Eros' music makes me the most happy. It takes me away from reality and in to another world. I love it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put it down! I can't wait to see the movie. Full of excitement. Storyline kept  me wanting to go on.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|If you ask me, this app is not as good as the first one. I think that it's a lot more difficult.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|A poor follow-on to the Bourne Trilogy.  If you have nothing better to do, worth the rental, but don't bother if you have other options.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good graphics lots to do looks good on kindle fire. Not to difficult nice easy game to play good mini puzzles
178022219X|1.0|I bought (bought!) this book on a whim.  Am I ever sorry.  It was plodding, but I went to the end.  Vile, manipulative, horrible, cheap ending.  Grotesque.  I read it on a trip and left it, purposely, in the hotel, but now I am sorry:  I should have destroyed it, and that's not like me at all.  Seriously, no one should read this.  Ugh.  I need a deep cleanse.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen's humor and sincerity wrap into one great cluster of amazing words. This is her best book yet and the insight into her life keeps you reading on. This book is worth your time and it will put a smile on your face, I promise.
B00AY9RV90|4.0|I wish the album was a bit longer. Maybe a song or two. It's easy to slip back into the 80's while listening to the whole album at once. Nothing [New] here, but if you like New Order you'll enjoy this.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great story. The movie did it no justice. Looking forward to the next book. Katniss is an interesting heroine and I hope she is able to pull through with her true love and find a way to rebel against the capital!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game sooooooo much. its not even funny. lol my parents yell at me for playing it so much.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love dragonvale. I could play all day, and if I could I would. I really recommend it.  I don't think there could be a better game.
B00012QM8G|5.0|What a man to get so many people to safety!  Liam Neeson superb in this role - he made me believe he was a great man & he was really upset over not being able to help others.  This movie was fantastic!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The game is very intuitive and makes sense. The graphics are very good. The game play was flawless with no glitches. If there is a down side, I just want more.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This is a classic CPU for a fast budget build. I'm a home musician, so I wanted 4 &#34;real&#34; cores (as opposed to an i3 with HyperThreading or an FX 4000 or 6000 series) and this was the cheapest way for me to do it.  The fact it'll do 4.2GHz with a Cooler Master Hyper 212EVO and the fan still doesn't spin up to max is icing on the cake.  Clock for clock the Phenom II is faster than a Bulldozer, and since we're talking about $100 it's WAY faster than an FX4100 in heavily multi-threaded loads, like the typical audio workstation.  It also can beat out an i3 at the same price.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was pretty good it wasn't the ending I was expecting. I can't wait for the movie to come out.
B005UG53NS|5.0|Excellent.  I have the complete series and this is an excellent movie.  The whole series is good.  It was fun watching the group grow up.
030726999X|5.0|The final episode in the trilogy finds Lisbeth recovering from near-fatal gunshot wounds, and approaching her trial. A guilty verdict would result in long-term commitment. The secret group within the Swedish Intelligence Agency is working hard to ensure that Lisbeth will have no credibility in court. Mikael Blomkvist is working to try and uncover their activities and actions.<br /><br />While this is hardly great literature, this book fulfilled all my desires for thrill and suspense. It moves at lightening speed, with a large and complicated cast of characters. As was the case with the first book, I found the journalism sub-plots to be much less interesting than the story of Lisbeth and the Section. Erika Berger's troubles at SMP struck me as an unnecessary side-note. Still, I read all 500+ pages in a single weekend. It couldn't wait to find out what happens, and I'm sorry that there won't be any more.
B00846TTDG|5.0|Excellent movie.  This is a very good movie and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.  I am glad I purchased it.
1594744769|5.0|My 10-year old grandson loves to read and I took a chance that he had not yet read Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.  I guessed right.  He read it in two days!
B00127RAJY|3.0|More than my arthritic body can handle.  I had hoped to be able to use this but it has proved to be too much for me.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This case works--you can put it in any position horizontally. The Kindle turns off when the case is closed, and it is held closed by a rubber band. I like the color, too.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Excellent.  I have the complete series and this is an excellent movie.  I thought it was neat it was filmed in Washington.
0765325950|5.0|just glad this book was finally released. Shipped yesterday and can't wait to read this work hopefully this will be as exciting as the others.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I loved the books and I thought the movie was an AMAZING adaption of the text. This DVD lives up to the novel and films greatness and has a TON of bonus features including a documentary of the making of the film.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that a temple run 2 is a great idea and believe it is so fun that is addictive
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This is a great  app for when your cell phone dies or just to have an extra back up. Wish it would give more options for buzzer sounds tho
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME EVER SERIOUSLY IT ROCKS THE HOUSE!  Ps I'm only 10 years old but ashy don't tell the authoritys.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I played it and it deleted all my data!!!!  I had a lot of coins and gems!!!!!  (this game sucks don't get it)  so don't get it its super worthless!!!!!  grrrrr
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Okay first I LOVE THIS GAME but what is -1gem mean? I love the game but what dose it mean? I mean have you gotten -1gem and if so tell me what it means! I don't get it.
B0087X728K|5.0|It is easy to apply following the directions on the Arctic Silver website. The directions take you through the proper way to pre-apply the compound for maximum effectiveness. Basically first you tint the CPU and heat sink to fill in the microscopic holes. Then for my CPU (core i7) I had to apply the compound in a straight line on the CPU. Also there are helpful tips on how to get the old thermal compound off your CPU. After applying there is a break in period of around 200 hours.<br />This product is helping keep my core i7 overclocked to 3.6 GHz very cool along with my Zalman cooler. I have not have temps over 75 degrees even after stress testing.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I would have to say,  I am enjoying myself with temple run 2 but there are some problems. The good points are it is addictive,fun and is better than the first while also adding new features like the save me with the also new gems,  there is a power up bar and machanic that I really wasn't very fond of because you have to spend a gem which are scarce and very useful with the save me, and also there are ziplines which i really like and are pretty cool. They also have minecart sessions which I am not a big fan of. there was a time in the game where i went really far into 2 million and after that run i went again. There was a HUGE difficulty spike and was a little unsettling. My biggest gripe with the game is very rage endusing. i would get into the 1 and a half to 2 million's and the game would just crash and take away the gem i used to get there and not give me the coins i should have earned. that is all overall if it was out of ten it would be an 8.5 out of 10
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Fast paced and very well acted by all, seen it twice great acton film Liam is awesome not what you would expect
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Have been playing the first Temple Run for awhile. Love it. Now that the second version is out I can't go back.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|I went and seen it at the movies and thought it was ok,just not a collectable.The movie was like watching an episode of law and order. Likeabe , but not great.
1427214948|4.0|I'm looking forward to Book 3 of the trilogy.  This book seemed to set the scene for the third book.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I'm totally addicted to this game... the graphics are amazing, love the zip line and the coal car in the mines. Great objectives... however... I can only give it 3 stars right now since the&quot;Save Me&quot; feature freezes and boots me out of the game, taking the gems and coins I've earned that round with it. Fix that, and it gets 5 stars!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|This movie was over-hyped for me.  I expected a movie with more depth -- in the realm of Inception or Memento.  This was a straight-up action movie and very little more.  The ending was poorly done and not the shock they wanted it to be.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt was still fabulous, but it was hard looking at him with all of the make-up to make him look so much like Bruce Willis.<br /><br />If you don't buy into the hype, you may enjoy this movie a lot more than I did.
B005LAIH54|1.0|When I was younger, I used to read about Greek and Norse mythology and watch as many movies about these mythological heroes as possible, from Steve Reeves as Hercules, Kirk Douglas as Ulysses to Jason and the Argonauts.  Wrath of the Titans is painfully bad, largely because of screenplay, editing and dialogue.  It's basically a movie for children who don't know any better.
B0083EW97W|5.0|I am enjoying this album. Great tunes! I may think about getting more albums. I would recommend it to others!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am able to get farther in this game than I could in the first Temple Run which makes me happy!!  However, it is challenging for me and I am hoping I make it into the mine area soon - I did it once and then I haven't been able to get back there so far.  Once you are in the underground mine, you need to tilt a lot and I'm never prepared for it - even though I know it's coming LOL.  The scenery is really good and a nice change.  Fun fun fun!!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Couldn't stop playing it. I would definitely recommend this game if you like hidden object/puzzle games.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Though I had the book figured out pretty early on, it was written in such a way that wouldn't allow me to put it down. First person perspective tends to do that to me. The characters were believable with the exception of their ages...seemed rather mature for high schoolers in some ways and in others completely like the teens that they are portrayed as. You will LOVE Dean...really love him!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is a very interesting book with valuable content to rethink your days. I really recommend it to everybody at all ages.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am able to quickly create notes, from grocery lists to doctors appointments and medicine lists to meeting minutes for different projects and share them immediately with my family or co-workers
B004H4XI5O|2.0|I like to read books about the brain, but this one is very boring, a lot of details about the social lives of the characters. Very little content. Disappointing.
B00A4TKDKY|3.0|Some lovely moments and also some messy playing too. Maybe the more I listen to it the better it will get.<br /><br />Thanks Buddy
B00064VR0W|5.0|Rod Stewart is a great singer with a long list of successful songs. The show is great, should be released in Blu-ray format!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the game is a bit glichy but not to bad could have done a lot better with the intereaction but I've  all it is ok
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 1 and now I love temple run 2 its just so cool even the zipline love the cool new feachers to
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is avery useful app to use on my andriod tablet. no flaws that I have found yet. Good app
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|Fun to play. Gets old fast. In order to progress at a reasonable time $100+ is needed. The animated characters are fun and the story is great. The price of land goes up after each purchase but the money acquired stays the same. A repetitive mini game needs to be played many times a day to get enough coins to progress or $10s of dollars needs to be spent.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|One of our favorite movies. We have been watching it off & on for years. Never a dull moment. Some of the best acting & directing. We replaced our old VHS with a DVD.
B008VBYN80|5.0|awesome game i love to to play when i free time from work but well worth the wait . i wish there was more games like this out there
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins continues Hunger Games in a truly seamless story. Can't wait to get Mockingjay, the final book in this addictive series!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|i think this is better than the first one, it has more cool.features like stairs and a zip line and a mine cart. the only problem is that when i click the save me button it blacks out, but it still makes me spent diamonds on it. overall, great game
B00AA7O22U|2.0|If you like to see things blown up then this is the movie for you.<br />Story line  would have been alright but most of the dialogue was lame.<br />Arnold looked bad and acting was even worse.Stallone and rest of cast<br />did a decent job with the bad lines they were given.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Totally engaging! Read this book in 1 day and now I feel like really know what happened. Great book and highly recommended.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|Great for protecting my Kindle Fire.  I would suggest this Kindle Fire Zip Sleeve cover for any one.  I think it is perfect.<br /><br />PMM
0525958002|5.0|I highly reccomend this book for Duranies & beyond.  It's informative on the music industry, & heartfelt.  I've had the chance to add to my music collection, based on other artists just from reading this, & had the chance to search other video clips on youtube as I was reading the book (which made it even more interesting & fun)
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Very good app, 20 or so sounds, sound good even with phone speaker, easy to use. I got thhis as faotd, but would have paid full price for it.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I am extremely happy to have this collection in my Blu-Ray library. I don't buy many films as Hard-copy but i pretty much had to have these. The ONLY drawback is that every one comes with a trailer in it. In my mind, if you make a special collection on Blu Ray, you do not have to watch any trailers. Otherwise, this is a perfect package!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|The most amazing movie! Watching this movie was a great treat! I would recommend this for all ages. Great to sit down and watch with grand kids.
B00164GDE6|5.0|thanks for order the only issue is was not able to track order and was quite a while for order to arrive
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I have always loved the Fast and Furious movies.  This is a wonderful addition to the series and my collection.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Good Grief! What does this say about the women of America that this twisted tale of misogyny and pain was a hit.  What could possible appeal to women when the lead male states multiple times \\"I want to hurt you\\"? I read this book till the end thinking it must get better, there must be some redemption for these characters. It is such a popular book it must have a turn to romance or improved mental health, something. Wrong. The end just left me wondering what has happened to the women of American that this is part of their book club lists.  I will not purchase book two or three. Save your ten dollars and your personal time.
1580176941|5.0|I highly recommend this book; it has lots of tips and techniques for the home or professional cookie decorator. This book would make an excellent gift.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I've read almost all of Demille's books and like his characters , this one was a good read and John Corey was true to form. as always his chapters are a little long but very entertaining. Read it ,if your a nelson demille fan you will be swept along with the drama and comedy.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Yes, this book is packed with all sorts of science that some people may find tiring - I'm not one of them. The journal entry style and the like-ability of the primary character (Mike Watney) and what he needed to do simply to exist on Mars made for a truely interesting and compelling story. If you can, just imagine being stranded on a planet millions of miles from Earth, alone, with only the scraps of Mankind to help keep you alive. Good read.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I hadn't read any Clancy since he started pairing up with other authors.  TV pales in comparison to Red October and Red Storm.
B008NMT684|4.0|works well.  my 2yo loves this.  He gets a little frustrated because it is hard to go to the home screen, but it works well and I have not had any problems.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|There have been at least 3 movies made from this novel, but none will tell the story quite like the book.  This is a classic romance that can be enjoyed at any age.  I've read this novel at least 3 times over the years.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is Temple Run, and it is Fun! I Think the Trip Mechanism may Be A Little Sensitive, Or I MayJust Be A Bad Player.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved these books and was happy that I could move right from one book  to the next.  I felt a little stupid when I realized it was $1 cheaper to buy the books individually.  Make sure you check the prices before you buy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft! soooooo much that I have it on PC, Xbox, ipod, and now *drumroll*....... Kindle! This game is great, not as detailed or unlimited as PC but its great that minecraft is even more portable!<br />  Craft On!
B000641Z90|5.0|Not only is it a great show, but hilarious how he introduces his crew. Adding more words because its required of me to add more. That's all I'm done.
B000001F29|5.0|The friends of Mr. Cairo is the reason I bought it, but the rest ain't bad.  If you don't know the Mr. Cairo song, get to know it, it's way cool man ! I remember it from 30 plus years ago.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Just a very well good read Mr. Dickins does a great job of describing the charters in each of his chapters
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|After a big change from Season 1 we start with a whole new Season of AHS. Amazing new story line and worth watching. I won't give anything away but if your already a fan ofAHS you will come to love and appreciate this Season.
B000W9DSVW|5.0|i love the oceans moviesthey are very well casted acted and scripted I can'tbelive that this was only 10 bucks One of my faviorte movies of all time
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This is, as always, a fantastic season. I absolutely love it, and highly recommend to all. Can't wait for season 5
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game. Easy and simple tasks. I think the quest boxes that always pop up are annoying. Cool. Gwme.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good fun app ... it will keep you entertained for awhile when sick or just plain bored. plenty of things to do
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This book arrived promptly, as promised, on my Kindle.  It was very graphic, but I learned many facts, and liked the story line.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I download this song for my grandson, as h e loves it, so therefore, I am happy with the experience
B00637TV1I|5.0|Jezebel rocks: driving rich deep propulsive enveloping melodic rock.  Song writing!  Sound scape.  Guitars.  Psychedelic Drift.  Haunting.  Climax after climax.  And the Lead Singer Haley Mary!  Compelling.  What a Great Voice!  Power Pipes.<br />Haley Mary sounds like she's flying.  The best thing you never heard.
B005ZMTYTQ|4.0|I enjoy adventure flicks and this one is a decent one of which when the kids come to visit I know is ok for them to watch too!! I like the thought that we aren't the only ones out there, this gives that a whole new spin and keeps you rooting for the kids.
B0063M22QO|4.0|good set up.  like hints and ability to shuffle.  good levels to set goals.  easy instructions.  many hours of challenging play
0446585041|4.0|I purchased this book for myself because I love Ellen.  The book came in excellent condition and the price was very reasonable.  I haven't had the chance to read it myself, but my Mom was seriously ill over the Christmas holidays and was in the hospital over Christmas.  When she got out, she had to go to a Rehab. Center and I let her read it.  She read it in one day.  She enjoyed it because there was no swearing like some books she had read.  The only disappointment in it was she thought it would be more of a story instead of it mostly being Ellen just talking about a numerous amount of things.  However, she recommends it if you love Ellen.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are very sharp. The horse moves just like a real one. I love the fact that there are unicorns! Easy to figure out but l wish that you could earn money quicker.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This too was another Christmas gift.  We had seen the show in the movie theatre, but had to have it as soon as it came out on DVD.  We pre-oredered this DVD and was so pleased with the quality, the sound and the packaging when we received it.  If you are an Alien fan, this is a must for your DVD collection.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There is no stopping  point in this book! You just keep reading, wondering what's going to happen next! Must read!
B001EL6EHC|5.0|We purchased this product for my nephew who loves the old movies.  He was thoroughly pleased with this because of all the extras that came with the DVD.  It definitely is a Collectors item.  It was packaged perfectly, excellent quality and the price was unbelievable for what was in it.  If you love the old movies, this is a definite must.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Sparks never disappoints his books are always great with excellent story lines this one had me on the edge of my seat.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Proof of heaven. It held my interest. Liked that it was written by a physician. It makes a person think.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Wonderful series...had us on the edge of the couch..couldn't wait to see the next episode! Looking forward to Season 2 release.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|The fold that serves as a stand for the case could be a little different and hold it up better. Overall the case is good though.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Surprisingly, the individual stories that lead into the wildly successful Avenger movie last summer,stand on their own. The CGI is amazing as they turn a skinny kid into a kick-ass warrior who goes from PR stunt to a real war hero.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|Ranks as the worst book I have ever encountered.  No symbolic messages, nor meaningful relationship to my life whatsoever.  Do not waste your time expecting a valuable message...vapid ridiculous kids tale gone bad.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Very user friendly. Like the look of it. Like the features for free downloads. Love the cloud storage and the fact that most of the albums I buy I get mp3 versions of.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Reminds me of Anne Frank.  With little to be optimistic about, characters discovered ways to cope.  If you don't particularly like teenagers, this may help you discover how delightfully open and honest and real they usually are.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|lots of different options for games.  a great way to pass the time.  since it was free it makes it even better.  give it a try.
B000002KOY|5.0|I always considered myself a hard core Neil Young fan; collecting everything he does and waiting for the next release with baited breath. I thought of Crazy Horse as a sloppy rock unit with a lot of heart but little technique that Neil uses when he wants to rock out. What a load of Bull S#######. I am ashamed not to have heard of this masterpiece before. The musicianship, songwriting and harmonies are absolutely amazing. This is like hearing \\"After the Gold Rush\\" for the very first time without Neil playing or at least being credited. Danny Whitten was a great singer, even better guitarist and amazing song writer. After hearing Danny's \\"I don't want to talk about It\\", i can understand the pain that drove Neil to write Tonight's the night after Danny's untimely passing. This music is especially sweet on vinyl and the only other way i can describe it is to say it gives me the same cabin fever feeling as The Band's brown album. What higher compliment can i give. If you want straight ahead foot thumping rock with a few heart rending ballads and syncopated harmonies for good measure, then look no further. This is truly a lost rock master work.
B0030BOCF0|4.0|When I received this from seller it was exactly the way he listed maybe my record player is messing up or, i think the seller didn't know that it might be warped, since it came in the original wrapping paper, but only for the first song, but in all honesty I think it is still a great album to have. I wouldn't rate this lower since i think my record player might be part of the problem.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I also enjoyed this book,  l was disappointed with the murder of snow, I thought it would be more of a battle, instead that part was kind of rushed and skipped over.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you have read 50 shades of grey you will love this series! 3rd book does not come out until may which is a disappointment but I can't wait to read that one as well! great author and great story!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Like this game more than the regular temple run think this will b  the best game ever that's why I'm rating this.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|Our all-senior-citizen family loved this movie (it's not for kids, if for no other reason than they would be bored to death). Highly recommended. Just get it and enjoy. If you do but don't enjoy, check the age on your drivers license: you probably haven't put enough years on your odometer!
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|It is so good filled with so much emotion. You feel what they feel right along with them. It's a beautiful story
B0063IH60K|4.0|I play every day It is addicting and a very good version. Plus it's free!!!! Now I have to write five more words
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was awesome. The twists and turns that Suzanne Collins has created overwhelm your mind and throw the reader into the true fire and romance of The Hunger Games.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is a nice fun game and I love the competitions. It gets a little complicated but is a game I would play any time
B0082Z447U|4.0|Thought it was a bit slow at first but it holds your interest and you have to carry on and find out what is happening.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Okay, everyone was right.  This game is fun.  I've been a hold out but recently tried it.  Now I can't wait to have time to play it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is so awesome stop reading this if you don't want a spoiler alert a giant monkey charges at your character at the start and when you trip over anything.
B004R0YHI0|4.0|Some detractors of this movie fault the characters of the Wilsons. True, they weren't saints or perfect. That's not the point. The point of the film is to show how the Bush administration illegally broke the cover of a CIA agent (whether she was a good agent or not is also not the point) to get revenge on any who stood in their way. In this case, her husband who was exposing the bare-faced lies that the Bush administration was using to start the Iraq war, a war that wasn't and still isn't in this country's best interests (just like Vietnam). Another detractor asked if Libby is always sneering. Of course he was as was Bush, Cheney, and other of Bush's Gauleiters to show their contempt for the people who elected (and stupidly re-elected) this bunch of criminals. It's too bad this movie wasn't released while George \\"Dubious\\" was still in office altho he'd probably have had to have someone to explain it to him. Or Cheney, Rove, and Libby would've gone after the studio, director, and writers.<br /><br />I didn't give this film 5 stars because I dislike the hand-held camera work (I don't know why they think this is more realistic) and the script could've been tightened a bit.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Just learning how to play this game.  It is fun. I would recommend this game. I will try others in the future.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app is great, i love all the different sounds to choose from.  I have gotten so that i use it everytime i lay down or just sit for awhile to relax.  I love it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love this program. I have watched all the seasons and love the characters and the history of that time period.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|The movie was good, still not as good as the original but the updated graphics and explosive action made up for the lack of originality in this remake. I Was a little disappointed that some of the Iconic scenes from the original never made it into this remake however ironically that is probably the reason I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The movie could be considered a remake but it also seems to come off as its own film. This &#34;Total Recall&#34; is almost and entirely different movie then the Original &#34;Total Recall&#34; and I think that makes it worth watching as a stand alone movie.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Loved this movie.  Another great baseball &#34;behind the scenes&#34; take and Clint Eastwood is ideal for the part.  This movie was a good counter to &#34;Moneyball&#34;.  I recommend it even for casual fans of baseball.  It's a look inside the scouting process and the subplot speaks to the fact that you're happiest when your doing something you love.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Really enjoyed this game. It was challenging, loved the hint button and the many hidden object games. Can't wait for the sequel!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Good book enchanting. Ready to read many more like it.. why am I doing this. Just want to finish the book. .
B007EECSFA|5.0|This was an enjoyable read.  The ending came as a complete surprise.  Very interesting descriptions of life during war times and how people recover after the war.
0525478817|5.0|This book has humor, philosophy,love,and tragedy. This book made me cry and laugh; I just loved it. I recommend it to anyone.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|The attention to detail makes one feel as they are at the scene with the victims, criminals and police. The reader feels as if we are solving the crimes.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|If you loved &#34;Once Upon a Time&#34; season 1, then you have to watch this.  The stories and characters are still good and more fairy tales are being woven into the story.  Wow, how intricate can this series get?  If you haven't seen the first season, I recommend you start from the beginning.  Otherwise, you won't know what is going on, who everyone is, and how they know each other.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book! It took so many twists and turns I couldn't put this one down. I am ready to read more about Sky & Dean!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great on the kindle fire. Ads do pop up right before the game starts,but not a problem during the game.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Fine movie but compare to other pixar movies it is only okay. Too girlish I would say. Just like any other pixar movies the computer drawings are amazing
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game very enjoyable great exciting horse game. My girls love this game they don't want to stop playing at no night
B00B2V66VS|1.0|it is very fun but it keeps force closing. if yiu only want to play twice then go ahead and get it but its gonna keep force closing on you
B008MEM24S|5.0|bought this game after I finished where my water.  its really fun<br />I spend way to much time playing it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a really great game.  a nice tribute to the original without being a clone of it.  This is definitely a must have for all Temple Run fans.
B001J1K5IG|5.0|Almost anything with Kevin Costner is guaranteed to be great (except maybe Waterworld). He brings a dark truth to the heroic character portrayed in Tombstone which by most historical accounts is much more accurate.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|It was amazing. I'm a<br />Huge halo fan though. Over all I loved it. Best book ever<br />Loved it a lot
B001O4XWJM|3.0|This movie starts off with a mediocre plot at best and the end is fairly anticlimactic and a disappointment. The cast is excellent and there is no doubt they have talent but the storyline fell extremely short.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game<br /><br />Love it. Its really fun.  You can actually play the game, unlike other horse games that  downloaded. Awesome!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I loved the original temple run so I was exited about this one but whenever I played it I was overwhelmed by unplayable lag and alot pf times when I would try to jump or move It wouldn't let me and I would die ........don't buy this game
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This is really fun and totally addictive,  loaded it on my note 2 where it plays well.  Loaded on my asus tablet which is even better. I can (and do) play this for hours.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like the fact that they changed the place and the animal is a lot bigger and it is fun and addictive
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Creative  choice of sounds. Not just the standard ocean, rain and the forest. Also the variety within categories is excellent. Multiple types of rain, wind, etc.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I bought it as a gift and then it got passed to me to.  It was attention getting and I can't wait to see season 2.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love the 30 Day Shred!  It really works. I rotate this in with a little running and hiking tumamoc hill and I can totally see a difference. I was on level three for a long time and decided to go back to level one and was amazed that I was sore the next day even though level one was a breeze. That's how you know it's working. Now if I could only get my diet on track :)
B0053O89RY|5.0|I love the series and this is a way to watch them over and over without the ads. It is great for the whole family.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I heard about this via a real estate speaker/motivator.  I bought it and was enthralled as the story weaves in and out of history, what the shoe companies have done to us (I am not an anti-capitalist guy), and what some people can really truely enjoy.  This is not just for hard core runners, it is for wanna be runners or for someone who has always wondered why people run.
B000002W9Q|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  The soundtrack is a compliment to the movie.  You will have the time of your life listening to it!
B009JBWOU0|4.0|Christopher Nolan had to expertly make a trio of Batman films like no other: truly dark featuring expansive sets, state-of-the-art FX, and, most of all, impressive performances from its stars.<br /><br />The first of the three, \\"Batman Begins,\\" sports the best performance by star Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman.  In the movie, Bale delivers his distinctive turn in the role previously assayed by the likes of Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, and, of course, Adam West on TV. Bale is very good, demonstrating why he was chosen for the role and why he is constantly in demand in Hollywood.<br /><br />Bale takes a backseat to the late Heath Ledger in \\"Batman Returns.\\" In this one, Ledger takes the role of The Joker to a more psychotic level than has ever been presented before.  Ledger's take is more frightening and demented than previously has been presented.  He deserved the posthumous Oscar awarded him.<br /><br />Finally, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" suffers from what befalls many films: it's just too big...too many villains, overuse of special effects and violence at the expense of character, and a hazy plot that appears just thrown together.<br /><br />Although Tom Hardy's \\"Bane\\" is a worthy menace to Batman and Bane does admirably in the role, the film starts rather lacklusterly and ends on a rather predictable note. The first thirty minutes alone move too slowly.<br /><br />Additional acting kudos should be given to the other regulars common to all films: Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Michael Caine as faithful butler Alfred Pennyworth.<br /><br />Overall rating: 5 stars for films 1 and 2; 3 stars for the conclusion in the trilogy
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series gets better and better.  I dont know if Im gonna able to wait for #3.  Only think I dont like is the fact that they are much shorter than 50 Shades and the books are so spread apart by release dates
B006LS7DQE|2.0|Having played and become a big fan of Puzzle Quest on the DS I thought this would be fun to have on my tablet.  Sadly the game is so buggy as to make the \\"quest \\" part of the game unplayable.  Any time I have tried to use a portal the game shuts down.  So I have tons of money and supplies that I have earned after winning puzzle battles but no way to use them to upgrade my character or spells which is frustrating.
B000093BDX|5.0|Always loved the Beach Boys.<br />This music will be a classic<br />forever. No one could ever<br />create a sound like theirs.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved this book.  I think what spoke to me most as an RN in an ICU was his view on family being at his bedside at all times changed my views on my practice.  We often struggle with how long to allow visitors for patients who are so sick but after reading this I struggle no more in most cases.  I loved how this was written from another medical persons view, it really drew me in.  Even if you are not a medical professional it really is a great book and this author does a great job explaining all medical aspects in a way everyone can understand and that is interesting.
6305268177|5.0|Love the Bee Gees.<br />Always have and always will.<br />Miss Robin and Morrise.<br />This concert was great.<br />Covered most of their hits.
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|I work nights so this really helps relax me and helps me fall asleep faster.  It has so many sound options.
6305781427|5.0|My very first introduction to Yanni.<br />I was a fan after the very first song.<br />This concert was awesome, using<br />the Acropolis as the background.
B000002UJQ|5.0|everyone already knows this is a great album i could go on for days about how awesome it is but check it out if you havent done so already
B0062NAX1U|4.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  If you liked the movies \\"Remember the Giants\\" anf \\"Fireproof\\", you will also want to add this to your collection.
B001TW69J4|5.0|i've seen aal live and they are great  their songs tend have the signature sound but they keep things very interesting and are very complex please check them out if you like good music
B0034G4ORC|1.0|The back of the cover essentially called it a mixture of Independence Day and District 9. Independence Day was enjoyably stupid and idiotic, and can be considered a good old popcorn flick. Battle: Los Angeles is too generic and boring to be enjoyable.<br /><br />District 9 is ugly, prententious and derrivitive. There's nothing in Battle: Los Angeles that is remotely close to being as ugly or pretentious as District 9, and yet it's even more derivitive than District 9 was.<br /><br />Acting is irrelevant as there's no character to speak of. Unless you're a die hard fan of Aaron Eckhart in Two-Face Mode of acting and you'd like to see him in military uniform. I'm not.<br /><br />There's no plot to speak of beyond the mere premise that aliens are invading Los Angeles and only the United States Military can stop him. Sounds like Battleship and Act of Valor, only all the scorn directed towards the latter ought to be transferred over to Battle: Los Angeles as sheer indifference instead (FYI: Battleship was dreadfully boring as well). And there's no point in talking about the techniques of the film because doing so would be irrelevant.<br /><br />Derivitive, boring, and completely worthless. Many, many people rank this movie as one of the worst films of 2011. Alas, it deserves the low scores it gets, but none of the extreme venom. It's worth more time forgetting the movie and doing something productive--like playing Pokemon like I did during the movie last night--than it is to despise it. Think of it this way: If I could rate it a 0, I would.  But it doesn't deserve a place on my 10 Worst Films of the Year List.<br /><br />The worst crime an action movie in general can commit is to be boring (though there are exceptions where the crimes can be more severe; Looper, anyone?). And this film is a violater of that crime.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|ive listen to cc since their first album and they have progressed and in my opinion matured and gotten better i know some people hate when bands change their sound but i think they are still true to their roots and are producing great music im very excited to see them in april !
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game truly got very better graphings changed for the good you can ride on a rail now and the zipline is amazing truly a good new game
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This fairytale is such a good story.  It has been as popular with our adult daughter as it is with out two young grandsons ages 2 and 5.  Disney movies always tell an important lesson and rarely have I been disappointed in giving them as gifts.  They are fun entertainment for the adults too.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|It was interesting and different. It was a relief that the plot wasn't another same old story line. Hope the next book is as good as the first.
B009XTF8KQ|4.0|---------------------------------------------------------------<br />\\"The Possession\\"<br />(Lionsgate, 2013)<br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br />Note: spoilers below. Don't freak out.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br />This demon-possession/exorcism movie follows a conventional -- and pleasantly old-school -- narrative, with the glum young daughter of recently-divorced parents coming into ownership of a creepy wooden box which, when opened, unleashes an evil spirit that warps and ultimately consumes her. The twist, such as it is, is that this spirit isn't your run-of-the-mill Catholic-theology, Satan-affiliated demon, but rather a dybbuk, a demonic damned soul from the Jewish tradition, which pretty much acts the same way as all the other demons in movies such as \\"The Exorcist,\\" and \\"Omen,\\" but needs a Jewish cleric to expel it from its host, preferably a Hasidic rabbi with long payot and a preference for dark clothing. The film is anchored by an excellent actor, Jeffrey Dean Morgan (perhaps best known as the dying/ghost boyfriend, Denny Duquette, on TV's Grey's Anatomy) -- as the family dad here, his reactions are realistic and proportional, with Morgan doing his best with the role. Even more noteworthy are the two young actresses who play his daughters, Natasha Calis and Madison Davenport, who both deliver impressive and understated performances: I'd keep an eye on both of these kids to see where their careers go from here.<br /><br />This is a pretty average demon movie, admirable for its slow pace and conscious throwback to an earlier era of psychological tension and suspense, as opposed to gratuitous gore and voluminous special effects -- this is Amityville/Omen/Shining stuff, not Freddy and his splattercore spawn. There was room for improvement -- for example, the creepy, battered old box could have looked less overtly creepy, since it doesn't make much sense that a ten-year old girly girl would have wanted it in the first place, or that her dad would have bought it for her, no matter how much he was into buying his kids whatever they wanted in order to seem like the best divorced dad ever, but whatever. It's a creepy magic box that seduces its victims, and that's that. The Jewish angle is okay, although clearly there's a Holocaust backstory waiting for a sequel (it's not in this film, but you know it's coming). While the film largely avoids overt stereotypes, the portrayal of its Jewish characters is a little eye-rolly: a secular academic that the dad goes to talks cryptically in a funny cadence, and the somber Hasidic cabal that he's sent to are otherworldly and exotic, though perhaps no more so than the shifty Catholic priests in \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" Hey, it's just a silly horror movie: the stereotypes could be much worse. Overall, this was a perfectly serviceable, fairly suspenseful film, derivative but with a few new chills and some very strong acting. Worth checking out.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game easy to use and addictive.  Fantastic.<br /><br />If you like card games you will love this one.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is amazing! I am moved. Touched. Angry. Confused. Happy. Sad. ... wow. Be prepared for a torrent of emotions, and enjoy every moment.
0345803485|4.0|this was the best of the three - kept my interest and also made me want to read book 2
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazing better than temple run except temple run is just how the guy runs on temple run is amazing awesome game you should get this and its free
0345803507|1.0|this was the most boring of the three books - only at the end do you really find out the stuff you want to know - otherwise 3/4 of this book was boring -- am not interested in any book about or from Christian's perspective - I had enough of the Fifty Shades
B004X4R49Y|4.0|This is a movie that was made to win Oscars. Colin Firth is fantastic. You would really, truly think he has a stutter. Geoffrey Rush is a bit restrained compared to his normal acting self, and thus knocks the cover off the thing. The acting reminds me of `Tailor of Panama,' a not-very-good movie almost nobody saw, but in which he was brilliant. Helena Bonham Carter does what she usually does, which is turn in a command performance seemingly by accident, or as if she were not trying. Add in excellent directing, wonderful costumes, British accents, an interesting vintage filmy look to the whole print (I wonder what film stock they used), and I suspect the knickers were dropping at the Academy before Act 1 was over. So that's the good news, and this is a perfectly fine movie to see when car chases and explosions are not what you want tonight.<br /><br />However, and of course there is a however, one thing about this movie really annoyed me. I'm a lifelong stutterer. I manage it better than Firth's character and, luckily for me, I have the opposite reaction to public speaking. Like a lot of stutterers, mine disappears completely when I am speaking, acting, or singing on stage. Also, like essentially all stutterers, mine disappears when speaking in unison or singing. One of the reasons many of us with speech impediments enjoy acting and singing is that suddenly, for a while at least, we get to be as facile with spoken language as the rest of you.<br /><br />The King's Speech gets _some_ of this right. But it gets a lot of it very, very wrong. For years it was believed that stuttering had to do with childhood trauma. Distant parents. Domineering fathers. Hysterical mothers. All of that good Sigmund Freud type stuff. The trick is none of that checks out. Stutterers are no more likely to come from screwed up childhoods than the rest of the world. Also, stutters cannot be `cured.' A good percentage of children who stutter simply stop as they enter their teens, but if you hitfifteen and stutter, you've got it for life.<br /><br />I can hear you saying, `But this was how they treated it during the era of the film.' And yes, that's true. In fact, the way King George was treated by the historical Rush was actually progressive for its time. A good number of the simple things (breathing, speaking slowly, practicing) are still the most practical treatments for a stutter. However, in the film this soul-searching about childhood in the royal household is portrayed as having some _therapeutic_ benefit. Which is simply impossible. Perhaps it's even intuitive, but it still is wrong. It's one thing to show that trial by ordeal was used to convict witches, it's quite another to portray it as good jurisprudence.<br /><br />In addition, it pains me that parents of children who stutter would think they had somehow done something wrong raising their kids. They might well have been miserable parents, but that would have nothing to do with any speech impediments in their children. Also, it pains me to think that children who stutter would think of it as an indictment of the job their parents did, which is utterly false. So again, the portrayal of what happened is fine, but the portrayal of the results is pants. We wouldn't have a doctor actually curing people with leeches in a movie these days, even if that's what they thought did the job back then.<br /><br />So, if your kid stutters, ignore this movie give her lots of chances to sing and write. We tend to enjoy that because, again, we can start sentences with those `problem consonants' and it's refreshing to be able to say things like civilians for a change. Even only on the screen or the paper, at least I don't have to be sure nothing starts with a 'k.' If you want to see a really good movie that makes some serious, unfortunate mistakes you might very well enjoy this one. It's compelling, and it't even funny and fun to watch at times. The domestic scenes with his kids, put there shamelessly to make you like King George more, play the heartstrings like a bluegrass fiddler with a quart of shine in him. The acting is fantastic and you really do root for Firth and Carter to wind up `winning' in the end. And it is gorgeously shot. Just be careful what you believe after seeing it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|more for younger kids than adults however there are a few fun ones for adults too.  My grandkids like it
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just randomly found this on my Kindle and started watching the very first episode during Christmas holidays while visiting family out of town.  I loved it. After the holidays I found the season on our Netflix at home on the TV and watched all of the episodes from Season I, but Season 2 wasn't available. Then my son gave me an Amazon gift card for my birthday. And I found Season 2 available and downloaded it on my Kindle  - so I've watched some of those episodes, but not all of them yet.  I had never heard of this show before. Then randomly a couple of weeks ago saw that Season 3 was starting on our PBS Channel and I'm following it on TV now.  I love watching and reading about people in these time periods.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|My daughter saw it one day and she commented on it - I ended up giving her mine and had to order another one - great!
B00AECGQF2|1.0|I hate it.  Would like to delete it off my Kindle.  I probably will later on to make room for something else.
0345803493|3.0|This was not as good as the first book - wasn't holding my interest like book 1 did - you sort of have to read it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Had this app on my iPhone and was so happy to finally get it on my kindle! It is the perfect game!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game for traveling or anytime really - glad to have a good one cause I do have some real duds
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing show! I can't wait to keep watching. This keeps you on your seat and you never know what's going to happen next.
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you have never tried Pinterest, you are missing out.  This app is awesome.  I can pin things while surfing my phone due to having this app on my phone.  Love it!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is awesome, addicting, and better than the first! Graphics are pretty nice too. The only problem I've green having though is when I try to open it, it'll open up to the loading screen, and then just exit out. I uninsgalled it and reinstalled it again and it worked again. But now it's doing it again! I'm on a Kindle Fire by the way. Overall a great game.
0345803485|5.0|I love this series.  It was really good and it was very hard to put down.  I read it every chance I got!!  It does have a lot of sexual content so be aware.  I loved it!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I got this game because i love the first temple run but once I downloaded this onto my kindle fire, every time i tried to open it up, it would be forced to close. This app may work for the kindle fire HD but sadly it wont work on my regular kindle fire.
0345803493|4.0|I loved the first book.  In turn, I was expecting a little more going into this one. It was somewhat disappointing because I couldn't seem to get into it. It is good so do not give up and keep on reading.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have always wanted a horse but never could have one, and this app is very fun to have and kinda see what it's like. I recommend it for all horse lover's!
0345803507|5.0|I love this series!  I wish I could find something else like this to read.  I would have never guessed the ending, but still really good!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Simply fantastic!  The role of men as the leader of the family, partner, and father is sorely lacking from our society...but divine inspiration through the word of God can always lead hearts to the truth!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I'm not a fan of the first temple run, it was really predictable. but this one fixes those problems, just, not all of them. instead of running straight paths where you can see obstacles a mile away, they added twists, turns, and ziplines. and in addition to coins, they added gems. but the game is buggy when it comes to gems and hit detection.<br />first, the hit detection. I can avoid a wall, a fallen tree, and a tumbling spike wheel, but the twist and turns on the segments where you have to hug a side of the track is unfair, sometimes I will move to the side and I will fall through the ground. sometimes I will just die out of no where. and sometimes, I will turn and an obstacle is immediately popping up out of no where.<br />then the gems, I had 4 gems from a single run. I died (because of the previously stated cheap deaths) and I hit SAVE ME, instead of resuming the game though, it spends the gem and closes the game down. I just wasted all my gems because this games bug proofing is shown to have not been finished.<br />good game. too many bugs, especially since those bugs came from what might have made this game a whole different breed of running.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was hard to read at first, but it really turned out to be a good book. The writing made the book really worth it.
B00AHXIC50|3.0|I love Bruno Mars just as much as I love Ben Folds. They both have great sounding music, but their lyrics are all about things I don't want to hear about. Bruno Mars insists on singing about explicit materials when it really isn't necessary and that brought this album from a 4.5 to a 3 for me. I wish he'd go back to his doo-wop and hooligans days, at least he had a few tasteful songs back then.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|This is a great continuance of the HIMYM series.  I would suggest this to anyone who likes HIMYM or a show like Friends.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Definitely three books that I couldn't put down. I cannot wait for the movie. To see who you will choose to role play Christian and Ana!! Thank you E L James for the extraordinary read!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Well for me the story was not so bood-thirsty on the page as it was on the screen.  I enjoyed getting to know the characters all over again and I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.  This was a novel I could not put down and read in two sittings (while on holiday).
B00936A0RU|5.0|Lawless is my new favorite movie. Great cast, and Tom Hardy has given us one of the coolest characters I've seen in awhile.  I will just say that I love everything about this movie. I saw an interview with Tom Hardy and he said the director has a three hour version of Lawless. I would love to see that version too.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|My expectations of this novel high and I wanted to read it before seeing the movie.  I was not disappointed as the story is fascinating and clever, the characters are believable and likable.  I enjoyed every page.  Now I hope the movie lives up to the book.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I purchased the game on my kindle fire-wanting a good mix of storyline, puzzles and hidden object fun. I was very pleased with everything about the game-beautiful graphics-moderately difficult mini games/puzzles andlots of different locations within the story with an excellent map to keep you oriented. Definitely recommend it and I will be looking forward to more from G5!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book was one of my favorites. It is so intense when the plot starts happening,  it is just something that is to hard to put down. I really enjoyed the fact that it went between two time frames so you got to see the characters evolve and become an important part of the novel. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good read definetly a good read.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have horrible insomnia and the range of noises this app offers me is great. It is easy to get to sleep once I turn it on and pleasant to wake up to. Even my 3 year old loves falling to sleep to the rain on the tent.
B007Z8ZKS2|3.0|I read this as a suggestion from my sister. She had read it and said that it made her cry and that she enjoyed it so much. I bought this book to read on the flight from NYC to LA and i ended up reading the whole book. It was an easy read, a sad story but wasn't a tear jerker for me.
B0033G9NT2|5.0|Kudos to Back on Black.  Great remastering, great vinyl pressing.  Awesome bass response.  Recorded to 96kHz/24bit DVD audio and love it in the car.  Just like spinning the vinyl in my car without the limitations of a 44kHz/16 bit CD step.  Love the extra tracks and 2 LPs so we are not crowding the grooves.
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|I read this after reading Gone Girl by Gillian Flyn and this was a crazy rollercoaster of a book. I couldn't believe the twist that happened at the end. I enjoyed this book a lot although at times it was a bit confusing.  But definetly if you enjoyed Gone Girl by the Gillian Flyn then you will definetly enjoy this as well. She has a crazy twisted way of making you be like WHAT?!?!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing is all I can say--- WOW! This book is a must read. The movies can't top your imagination :)
B009VB97EY|4.0|Love Channing Tatum as an actor. he is so sexy! I have watched every movie he is in and look forward to seeing him in more movies.
B00000IUT7|5.0|I gave this engine to my husband for Christmas.  We have a Brio train set up around our Christmas tree, and he wanted a heavy duty engine to pull the train.  This one fills the bill.  It can pull several cars up and down hills and over bridges.  It is really great!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I am among those who have seen all the Bond movies.  I am old enough to have seen Goldfinger in a first run theater, an experience I will never forget.  For the longest time, I thought Goldfinger was the best Bond movie.  The Aston Martin, Jill Masterson (the golden girl), Oddjob, Pussy Galore, and one of the best movie theme songs of all time--lightning captured in a bottle.  For those of you too young to appreciate it, there were two actors working in the 60s who defined \\"cool\\", and Sean Connery as James Bond was one of them.<br />Now, there is Skyfall, which I believe is the best of the Daniel Craig as Bond movies.  Great song (will Adele ever make a mistake?), tight script, thoughtful direction, and they brought the Aston Martin back.  Others have said it better than I, but this is a good movie, not just a good Bond movie.  That said, if you watched Goldfinger and Skyfall back to back, you would see that Goldfinger and Oddjob are comic book villains, and you would know, just as I knew when I first saw it, that Bond would figure out how to stop the atom bomb from going off.  No real villains, and no real suspense.  Is it still fun to watch?  You betcha.  Every time.  It's that combination of things that simply work without wearing out.<br />Is Skyfall better?  Well, it's different in tone, much more sophisticated in style, and vastly superior in the technical sense.  I'm giving it 5 stars because \\"I loved it.\\"  But when I watched the two of them, I came away thinking how it's harder to be original, it's harder to be cool, and it's harder to capture lighting nowadays.<br />By the way, Daniel Craig does remind me of Steve McQueen--pretty cool.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|i have been looking for a good free roam gta style game and i came across thisgame and i am a cheapskate butspent the money for thisgame and i am glad i did. this game  feels soo much like gta san andreas i couldnt believe it. i wasnt expecting much out ofa tablet game but this one is the shizzle if you are even thinking of getting this game, DO IT! this game is great.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I would recommend these books to anyone who recognizes that mankind is flawed and will forever be conflicted between our acceptance of mutually administered brutality and our own personal relationships. Fortunately for us all, this is all pure fiction.
0316044695|5.0|This book was so interesting, and scary. I read it when it first came out and am reading it again (2013).
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It is a story about family, love, and the reality that life can deal out an unfair hand to anyone at anytime.  I am not the type to cry often but there is one scene in this book that was written with such intensity and clarity that I was near tears.  Well done, Ms. Moyes.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so cool. The way this game is programmed, it makes me feel like I am in the game because of the way it moves.<br />It is the curves on the path it's not just straight lines. Top notch game. Download it today!!!!!!!!!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|nice graphics!  very nice simple to use app for battery.  All I needed in a battery app,  and its Free!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Many friend had this app and then I got it too. It's a AWESOME app to get and It's all free!!!!!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because he was so descriptive in what he saw and heard on his entire NDE.<br />This book would be beneficial to anyone, any age.
1451629184|5.0|Wow, Jaycee Dugard, I am in awe of this young woman for writing this book.  Very well written!  Jaycee is a true &#34;hero&#34; in my book.  Awesome!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I was surprised at how realistic the movements of the horse are.  I've had horses & was glad to see a horse game on kindle fire.
B001AQT0UY|5.0|Since I first saw this movie as a kid I have always loved it, but never owned it. I saw it was on Blu Ray and decided to get it. This movie is just a great as I remember it and now it comes in crystal clear and still holds up today. The effects of course are basic compared to today's CGI effects. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of classic 80's movies.
1400069181|3.0|the writer had a lot to discuss in this book that makes sense. follow your dreams, passions, put forth the effort into things you love and they may form into global interest. I must say, by the end of the book, i lost interest. call me cynical
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good solitaire game.  I have not had problems with pop ups when I am not playing as others have reported. Play on my Kindle Fire.
B008MEM24S|5.0|fast, creative puzzle solving for all ages.  Sure to keep you and your kids entertained.  Probably the best app I have found so far (and yes, I'm including Angry Birds and Bad Piggies)
B005LAIH4A|4.0|The kids liked it so it was fine with me.  But it's the standard story of capitalism run amok.  And maybe that story needs to be told over and over, look at the early 1900s where they wiped out all the game animals before game laws and cut down almost every single tree in places like WV.  There was no consideration for sustainability and now there is.  I would hate to go back to no conservation.  I like to hunt and if you don't conserve the game, there is nothing to hunt.<br /><br />The movie itself is very well done so it got 4 stars from me.  Plus, like I said, the kids liked it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses so it was really cool to have one of my own! And be able to bye others!
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Over the top stupidity from massive action star cast.  It's a little amusing, it's just action. Forget plot. Forget story.  Who care, stuff gets blow up.  If you're looking for a literary masterpiece, you need to keep looking.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is so fun and the horses are so cute. it is easy after you learn how to do it and its awesome
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Got it for my mother and when I went to visit, I watched it with her.  I had never seen it before and I expected it to be grim (I like movies where stuff blows up).  It was better than I thought and this edition is very well done.  She doesn't have a HD TV yet and no blu ray player and I was surprised at how well the included DVD looked.  I couldn't check out all the features without a blu ray, but judging from the DVD, I suspect they are well worth the money.  It's certainly worth what I paid.
B002BWP4A6|3.0|It is different which I like,but not what I expected based on film description....more subtle impact...if you like story telling,then you might appreciate aspects of this film as I did....
B001DWNUCO|5.0|Okay so we will cut to the chase here, this is the ultimate pornographic film!! Its is by all accounts one of the most twisted, erotic, hardcore, violent, and entertaining movies ever. Where most films use porn or graphic violence as the main focus in a movie &#34;Caligula&#34; uses it as punctuation to tell the story of one of the most twisted roman Cesars ever. Malcolm McDowell is astounding as the twisted ruler, as are the performances by Helen Miren, John Gielgud, and Peter OToole. That being said this film is over the top in every definition of the term, but is entertaining never the less. It is after all these years the one film that to this day can shock, arouse, and horrify even today's De-sensitized audiences. Never before has there been such delight in depravity! The package is complete by the little snippets of humor that are inserted here and there. So send the kids to grandmas and give it a watch..If you dare!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I had a hard time getting through book 4, but this made it totally worth it.  Great characters, more action, better twists... just a much better read.  Half way through it now and can't put it down.  Highly recommend!!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This is hands down my absolute favorite book (and I read a lot)! Kate Morton has quickly moved to the top of my favorite author list. And this story is the one that firmly placed her there! A definite &#34;must read&#34;!
1863513418|4.0|The illustrations and directions are very helpful.  The finished designs are well done.  I know that I cannot getr this good with my work.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Kate Morton never disappoints! I'll admit that the first part of this book was a little dry for my liking, but it didn't take too long before I was completely sucked in and unable to put it down. Anything by Kate Morton is worth the time to read!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|The movie wasn't much once you got past the first few laughs. You quickly realize the entire primus of the movie revolves around smoking pot. Wow.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|the only thing I don't like is you cant choose your first horse but overall a very entertaining game for me to play
B005HSL626|3.0|Fun game except it freezes often and have to turn my kindle off in order to exit the game. Please fix this!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|there's nothing that I would change on this amazing game!! and its not so boring going straight in the original temple run..anyone would recommend this awesome game!!
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|The lessons he teaches about sushi are in fact lessons about life. And the filmmaker has captured the essence of this great soul. Movie, man, restaurant - simply magnificent.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|If you missed this at the theatre (or even if you saw it), you will want to buy this wondrous store about the end of the slave trade in Great Britain. The characters are great and the story even better. It is sad that so many movies that come out are not of this caliber.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app !  one of the first games I choose to play while eating lunch at work or waiting for appointments. lots of fun, especially when you win. no complaints
B005VT42BS|5.0|Quite often you get a product that does not only not live up to what it says it does, but isn't even in the ballpark.  This app runs flawlessly and quickly and does exactly what it says it does.  Cheers.
B006X08FDA|5.0|This band has released a wonderful collection of traditional Piedmont-style black folk music (as well as adding some of their own gems to the mix). The female vocalist is powerful and the instrumentals are spot-on. Great band!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is so awesome you should get it<br /> and it is so much better than temple run I love it so much almost best game ever!
B000IFQLSW|4.0|The song &#34;Prison Blues&#34; hooked me and led me to this cd. This is a great mix of blues - both acoustic and electric with studio and live performances. There are a few artists that I hadn't heard until buying this cd.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I have a kindle fire. When I first got it, I loved it. But now it won't let me open it anymore?
B0090X4HES|5.0|Would definitely recommend it to the hip hop crowd! Would recommend getting deluxe edition instead of regular version!  music sounds good!
0515142247|5.0|You can't go wrong with a Lee Child book.  His crisp style of writing doesn't waste pages with unnecessary dialog that you have to wade through.  Excellent book!
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Great product!  Lots of details from the movie that make this extra fun.  This is going to be a family project that is probably going to take months and we are looking forward to it.  Legos, Death Star, Family Fun -- what can be better?!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it.  rarely glitters, great grafics adorable horses. great for a horse lover. it is fun fun fun fun fun!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|We saw Phantom in the theater and did not have high expectations for this video.  Wow - we were impressed!  The music, singing and dancing were first rate and the ability for the camera to zoom in really enhanced the experience more than if you were actually at Royal Albert Hall.  There is no real substitute for a live production but you can't change your seat and zoom in either!  The cast was fantastic.  I think Raul could have been more loving but Christine and the Phantom were awesome.  We shared this version with our 14 year old son and 12 year old daughter and they loved it.  That says a lot!
B000BI0WOA|5.0|I had been hearing songs from this group on XM Radio, The Spectrum and decided I wanted a CD. I was very pleased this &#34;Best of&#34; set was available. I have enjoyed listening to it several times since purchasing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I bought this because I seen it in an airport and I needed something to read...It keeps the reader on edge and questioning all involved. Loved the book. Keeps you wanting more!!
B005HSL626|3.0|Not bad but it still does get a little boring after the 5th game. I used to play it a lot but it got really boring really fast. If u want a time waster or are just bored out of ur skull then this was made for u.
1884883303|4.0|This product has been very useful, seems acurite and authoritative. However, there is one point of frustration that I have found. Although the referance is very \\"comprehensive\\" in it's scope of manufacturers, it does NOT list product values for all of them. I understand that this may be too much to expect, or is it ? After all, is it the aim of the \\"Price Guide\\" to list all exsisting \\"Manufacturers\\" OR rather, the \\"Values\\" of the manufacturers products ? If your going to show a photograph of a specific product from a perticular manufacturer,I dont think it's too much to expect that you would then, at that point, show that particular instruments \\"price-tag\\". It IS after all, a Price Guide is it not? Or alternatively, perhaps the guide could simply list the producers price \\"range\\" for it's products. For example, Production models from \\"$$$ to $$$\\" and Premium/Custom models from \\"$$$ to $$$$\\". If values can not be reported then perhaps there should not be showcased a \\"picture\\" of a product. Again, why even list the procucer existance if values cannot be produced ? Also, although it is understood that this is an expensive suggestion of nothing more than \\"fluff\\", however it would be awsome if there were a \\"color\\" section showcasing some nice pairings of vintage guitar with amplifier as was done in Aspen Pitmans \\"The Tube Amp Book\\". Aside from these critiques, this Guide still has proven itself to be very useful and acurite.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is an exciting, thrilling game and it one of the best I have seen yet!!!!! I have spent hours playing this and it is one of my favorite games. There is nothing bad about it.All l can say is WOW!!!!
B0036S4CTS|5.0|I really love this book. It's sad and optimistic at the same time. It kept me reading for hours and wish it didn't end.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I was worried that my current copies of Harry Potter would wear out as much as I watch them. I bought a back up set of blu-rays. I love them. They inhance the movie more then you would ever believe.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just heavenly. If you have not read this, please do. Immediately. You will laugh, you will cry, you will ponder life, love and disease in the best possible way.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Not bad - nice graphics - easy to learn - good UI, not much new here.<br /><br />Ran quite well on my SIII, good frame rate.<br /><br />Needs a wait cursor on start up - I thought the thing did a hang up on me.  30 seconds is a long time to peck at the screen with no response.
B00ATPVA78|2.0|This could be a good game but there is too much talking and not enough actual play plus the whole $5 thing. Would spend a dollar or two to chance it and play the whole game but it is just not worth it from what I saw from the free version. Too many other games out there that are cheaper and usually lasts longer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome and exciting and fun but although is hard to earn money and gems get it know you&quot;'ll love trust me.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is probably my favorite game from G5! Great job! I don't always write a review but I wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed this. The perfect blend of ho, puzzles and talking. The story flowed and was easy to follow without being too easy and worked great with my kindle fire, not one glitch. The other great thing was it didn't cost the usual $5 (which I will not buy). Can't wait for the sequel! Would love more like this!
B003V5K0AQ|1.0|did not see it was only 30 min long. it was a waste of money. was expecting more to compare to new movie.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it worked fine at first but it would not let me play the second time. but once I deleted the app and re installed it. it was fine
B0083DJUMA|3.0|In my opinion, sometimes the conclusions are difficult to share.<br />But  the proposal is still stimulating.<br />I will be glad to become in a maker of this kind in a close future.
B001R55VWE|5.0|How do I find words to 'rate' a war story of such inhuman Nazi machinery?  Charlotte Grey puts human faces on the terror which ordinary people of the French countryside endured.  I could say that Charlotte's mission is to ensure that the hope doesn't escape from Pandora's box.<br /><br />Unlike some war films I didn't detect the 'f-bomb' bursting all over the landscape, ruining the experience.  And when a certain village mole attempts a rape, I suspect Charlotte is disappointed in herself for not shooting him according to her training.  Although she puts him off and declines his sexual advance, his treachery rips her heart out later (with my own.)  When she denies having done her best, I believe she's wishing she could have aborted that evil before it came to pass.<br /><br />Such epic tragedy, emotionally charged, suspenseful action, I was riveted in place.  I didn't leave the room at all for anything.  From the outset I was rooting for her to be able to reveal the truth, although the gruesomeness of the truth progressively escalated.  This role for Cate Blanchett is 180 degrees the opposite of her part in [[ASIN:B000OY8NBK The Good German]] ,  where she's the collaborator instead of the Resistance.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|My kids enjoy it and It passes time for me when waiting at job sites waiting on other people to get going.
B002KYHZLQ|3.0|Too many interconnected plots to fit my tastes. I never really got invested in any one character before he jumped to another.
B008RC72G8|5.0|I am a huge DARK SHADOWS fan. I'm old enough that I ran home from school to watch DARK SHADOW when it originally aired. This movie isn't as good as the original, but it's not bad.<br /><br />I went to the movies and saw this when it came out and thought it was &#34;just okay&#34;. I rated it a C-.<br />But after watching this Blu-ray at home for a second time. I think it's a much better movie. I jumped my rating up to a B+.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Most revealing look into history and formation of political process...Discovered little know facts about how Lincoln was elected.<br />Wonderful read.
0740748475|5.0|One room in my house is a library, so I have a few books. But this is probably my favorite book of them all!!!!!<br />I read this once a year just for seer joy. How can you read Calvin and Hobbes and not have a smile on your face?<br /><br />Yes, this is the book (volume #3) that is on my table by my chair that I'm reading at this time.<br /><br />I love all things cartoon. I love serious books. I love reference. But I just keep coming back again and again to Calvin and Hobbes.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|It was the expected case the really protect my cell of any scratches & hits.<br /><br />If anyone is looking for a real protective case, look no more, this is the one.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|BETTER THAN PERFECT!!!!<br /><br />what else can you say about the complete Beatle studio recordings in one remastered box.<br /><br />And finally, they sound GREAT!<br /><br />The bonus stuff was pretty much a waste of time in my opinion. But then you don't need to add or subtract from perfection.<br /><br />I like the well-made box with the magnet closer, but it doesn't fit into my CD rack.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great game but youll notice that its much easer than the first.No challenge like the skull pass in temple run.i scored 1 million points on my third run.Also you fan resurrect yourself a bunch of times EVEN<br />WHEN YOU DIE YOU CAN USE A GEM TO . KEEP YOU ALIVE....WTH
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Overall, this was a very good series of books. The first one gave us a glimpse into this massive (yet confined) new world, twisted my guts with intrigue while leaving me sad (and needing more). Although the second one dragged a little, the third one picked up the pace and barreled me to the end. It was a very satisfying read with excellent prose, very little typos (for self-published works), and a riveting, well-described setting. Very unique and very good.<br /><br />Plus, if you're into strong females in leading roles, these books are definitely for you. I highly recommend this series and will be looking forward to more.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|Really cool up until level 12.  When are they going to fix the cloud cover.. kindle fire problems smh... plz help!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Perfect weather station app.  Shows radar, 15 day forcast ,plus updates when bad weather is arriving.  Don't spend your $1.99 on the other app this one has it all.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Loved Brave! The storyline was so unexpected.  Not really your usual rebellous princess story at all. Would recommend to anyone who wants a little surprise thrown in from what is expected.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I use this to meditate and to help me sleep. This does wonders for me. As someone suffering from PTSD this helps me relax and calm myself. I also got this for my 8 year old and she sleeps better and falls asleep faster than before. I do wish we could mix sounds but it's not that big of a deal because it does it job as is.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is awesome I love trainning it is so fun barrels polo medumim jump small jump I love love love!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This version is just as fun as the first temple run. But with this one there are more challenges, characters to choose from, exciting obstacles, and so much more. I could spend hours playing this game.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Great but the ending was a little disappointing. Still, it was a good read and worth it for anyone who like intertwining stories.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE Temple Run 2! I really liked the graphics and how as you were running down the path, your screen moved with it. I also enjoyed the moving graphics such as the spike roller. The game makers did a great job. A+++
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have been using Evernote for over a year and it is amazing. I recently added it to my Kindle Fire.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|THE BEST RUN FOR YOUR LIFE GAME EVER.And I have to hand it to the creators for the big monkey beast.
B006LSZECO|5.0|My book group picked this one. It was a page-turner! I've recommended it to others. It definitely kept my attention.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Liked the second book better, thought this one was a little slow and missing something, too drawn out and could have concluded better
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Great show and the quality of the video is fantastic. Streaming through Vizio smart tv was great. No buffering. I will be buying the rest of the series.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is not for expanding your knowledge base. It was entertaining reading. It was reasonably paced. As with most of these books there was a degree of predictability (the good guy wins and gets the girl, temporarily).
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl through her journey and sharing it with the world gives validity to how many light workers come in and out of our life to help put us each on our own PCT adventure!
B00ANT6OK8|2.0|This is a film about America's revenge for 9-11  It took years but Osama Ben Laden was finally captured and executed.  The fact that he was responsible for 9-11 is assumed.  And so is the guilt of the many collaborators who the audience sees tortured.  This is not an easy film to watch and whether or not it portrays the events truthfully can be questioned.<br /><br />That said, I found the film tedious and painful.  I never identified with any of the characters and I found it much too long.  Frankly, I didn't like the acting either.  The female lead never showed one bit of humanity as she watched the torturing and the men were all stereotyped as being either good or evil.<br /><br />This is a film that adds nothing to the dialog as to what really happened in America that awful day in 2001 and even less as to the conclusions reached afterward.<br /><br />Yes, the acting was good and it did provoke dialog and for that reason it does not get my very lowest rating.  I rate it next to the lowest however.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is superior to the old one. The graphics are much better and to make it a little more challenging they added hills so you don't see what's coming up. My personal favorite is the mine cart they added.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Good story but a bit unrealistic.  My wife thought it was too violent, she didn't finish watching it. There was unnecessary nudity.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Have this on my android phone and was happy to see it for the kindle! Wish I could bring my horse from the phone but happy to restart. Can't afford my own real horse right now so this helps!!!!
B007V9N5R8|5.0|If you have been self printing or even printing elsewhere and wonder why your photos are too dark, it's your monitor affecting how you edit your photos.  This makes a big difference in the prints you will get back.  The passport hasn't been used yet but I plan to start using it.
0895260131|5.0|Great for debating todays issues. The facts are easy to comprehend, easy to digest and usually answers all the questions that will be asked in a debate.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is the frosting on the cake of the trilogy. I just wish it had been a quadrogy or quintogy (are those real words?) I just found the whole series fascinating.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I guess this is pretty good, the horse is pretty good, there's a lot of button pressing, its just pretty good. ya know
B007IXWKUK|5.0|As soon as I finished the first one, I bought Book Two IMMEDIATELY and started reading it! What a great series! I can't get enough of them!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Only issues I have with this app is that on my Kindle Fire when I go to the next chapter it takes me to the bottom instead of the top of the next chapter. Also, why is it that connectivity is required in order to highlight. That is very annoying. Many versions of the bible to choose from and download if desired. Some are audio. Probably the best bible app out in my opinion.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You know, I never thought a bit about biting my lip and actually never did it. Now I find myself doing that from time to time, realizing it, and remembering the book! I'm 62 years old and still found this thrilling, so seniors shouldn't hesitate to buy this and read it!!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I highly rec this game. esp if you're a war buff like me. the graphics are fantastic and the game runs smooth
B000002N25|5.0|I absolutely love this recording. mark has put together a group of songs that are based on human experiences from soft and gentle love songs to punchy guitar driven working class narratives. I have always liked Mr Knopfler and this Cd does not disappoint. I kept it in my car for a month, that's how good it is.
B000066AXE|5.0|I was very pleased with this product ! I got speedy service and a great product.  I will be buying from these people again.<br />  Thanks for your exceptional profromance !  Marqueta
B009IEXKXI|5.0|It's been a while since I read a SciFi book, but this one had me flipping pages as quickly as I could.<br /><br />The situation seems so real that it's hard to imagine it didn't happen.<br /><br />The main character, Mark Watney, shows what it takes to stay alive on Mars for a while, and keep a sense of humor while doing it.  If you're planning on that trip, this is a great read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is an amazing show and keeps getting better and better. I love it. I wish Netflix had them but that is why I have bought most of season 3 on amazon for a good price, never let me down before.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|Seemingly under-rated. As features such as, Cars and Toy Story seem to have enjoyed significantly more commercial success and public recognition, I feel it has all the classic components of a great Disney movie, as well as (arguably), a better story. Definitely worth watching and well deserving of much more credit.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|4 and a half is my rating  hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi punch  ha ha hs
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|Well written and has its funny,a well a, touching moments. A good work, but in my opinion not one of the greats. Still well worth watching.
B004IK30S2|3.0|Are there funny moments in Anchorman? Sure there are? Does it make me laugh from beginning to end? No, certainly not. Like Airplane it bombards the viewer with so many gags, hoping that they'll all work. Unlike Airplane, it fails. Most of the scattershot attempts at humor are just terrible. What's the deal with the gang suddenly singing 'Afternoon Delight'? Is this supposed to be hilarious? It's nothing. It slows down the movie. The narration is completely unnecessary and the hype, within the movie, around Ron Burgandy is distracting. He's not really a great character and exists in his own world of surreal nonsense instead of being more reality-based like the lesser characters (much like Jim Carrey with Ace Ventura). Had there been a more human element to Burgandy it might have made for a slightly better movie.<br /><br />The thin story, so weak it cannot stand on its own two legs, has a woman arrive at a male-dominated newsroom in 1970s San Diego determined to prove she can be just as good. The men react with horror. They clash. The material is so thin it is 2-dimensional. If you need any more proof check out the utterly terrible 'lost' Anchorman movie Wake Up, Ron Burgandy, a so-called movie assembled from deleted scenes and plots. Much of Anchorman should have been deleted too, but then the running time would barely exceed 70 minutes. Adam McKay and Will Ferrell simply did not have enough mileage for a feature length movie with this anorexic premise.<br /><br />For all his screaming and attention-seeking it's somewhat ironic that Will Ferrell's never became a superstar, while supporting actor Steve Carrell went on to much bigger and better things. He's clearly the best actor of the bunch and the movie would be substantially even less funny without him.<br /><br />It is sporadically funny. It is not as funny as the mass hysteria would lead you to believe. It is not a classic.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks great in 1.78:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. There are extras that I couldn't care less about.that I couldn't care less about.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great for horse lovers. my girls love playing this game. I even enjoy it when I am unwinding after a long day. fun to play.
B0017XD3OY|4.0|A good updated re-make of The Omega Man. Will Smith always does a fine job with the characters he plays.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is great for horse lover's! it is so much to play! I'm always on it! the graphics are great!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Really, why all the hype about this book?  I didn't find either of the main characters at all sympathetic.  Skip it.
078062999X|5.0|This film was a required viewing for a humanities class I took.  Since I figured I would only watch it once or twice, I bought the VHS for almost nothing.  Very happy with the movie...great value and quality product.  The storyline was better than I expected, too!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game sucks ! ! ! ! ! the first was good like the first week; kind of. now its so boring and there r so many better games..... do NOT waste your time downloading!!!
1884883303|4.0|Authoritative and fairly complete.  Some prominent custom luthiers were not rated which is disappointing, but all the high production brands are well represented.  Some limited editions and new models don't show up, but again, it's as complete as one could expect.<br /><br />No price guide can be 100% accurate.  Prices vary by region.  I use this guide in combination with online comps at reputable sites.  Craigslist and eBay listings are NOT valid comps.  People can put merchandise in at any price they choose, and most times, they bear no relation to what it's truly worth.  I guess checking actual sale prices on eBay is okay, but I don't have the time (or software) to do that.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Great read! Made me crave the trails again! I recommend this book to anyone on a self discovery search or anyone who loves backpacking.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|You should be able to make energy boosting food without using diamonds too though. And the grooming wont always let me finish before it says Im done.
0345803507|5.0|This is the last in the series of 3 and it arrived in pefect shape for a very failr price!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is amazing perfect for horse lovers and it can also show you how to treat an animal right
0345803493|5.0|Read the trilogy.  Great pulp reading for this past winter.  If you do not have an open mind, perhaps stick to an author who is a little less graphic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game keeps you busy and learn different things about maintaining horses. great for kids and adults. its a must download.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I thought this book was just extraordinary the whole series itself was amazing I would definitely recommend this awesome book
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Nice package for the price. Would recomend this to other people. Amazonshipping is always fast and well pa cked. Good movie also.
B00884GR0W|1.0|This is the first time I have been asked to review an app that I never remember. If I did download this it is very forgettable. If I didn't Amazon might have a bug in their system.
B007PS0DTI|4.0|Love these movies and it looks great using amazon digital services. HD quality and convenience is the best out there.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is a ton of fun. However it has a tendency to crash when using gems to save yourself and you end up losing anything you may have gained in the entire run. Bug needs to be fixed pronto!
B0053O89IS|5.0|I loved this series. I have all season that are out. I can't get enough of it. I would highly recommend it.
B0095R64AO|3.0|I was excited to watch this movie because I love the main actors, and the preview for it looked hear warming and funny. It was okay, but not as funny as I expected it to be. And the plot dragged on a little.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Andy Weir writes with great wit, creativity, and polish. His Mark Watney story is an epic story of survival, and readers will come to love this zany, brilliant, lonely astronaut.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book is that after a few chapters you sort of expect what is going to happen. Pretty much every chapter describes Mark doing things necessary for his survival, and then something going horribly wrong. Next chapter, he then describes what happened, and how he fixed the problem.<br /><br />While the ending is totally predictable, the way there is a fun read full of science, energy, and comedy.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie was hilarious- definitely worth watching! Everyone I talked to said I should watch it, and I wasn't disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|okay it's really fun but sometimes it won't let me jump or slide.  and it also says that I don't have gems when I really do! and I had 167;439 coins but after a run it said that I only had 435 coins when I didn't spend any! imangi studios you better fix this problem before others realize the problem!
1451662432|3.0|Its alrite...the only part I liked was The Secret. Nothing extraordinary...his book didn't capture at all but the pictures kept me somewhat interested.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|One of the best &#34;classic&#34; movies - the restored version really hits the mark for bringing out all the finer details of scenery and audio.
0756666937|5.0|This was another gift to my nephew and awesome was what he said after opening it!! It was one of his Christmas presents.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really loved the book it was so funny!<br />The best book I have ever read of \\"Diary of a wimpy kid\\"
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Pretty much improves on the original in every respect.  The Kindle Fire 1.0 can't really handle the highest graphic level, but it only seems to add shadows that actually obscure the 3-D models. The default graphics look great and the game runs like butter. Just get it already!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!!!! great graphics. very realistic and easy.  I wish the competion's varied. but. bot a big deal
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I watched it twice already and am ready for more. Maggie Smith and Judi Dench are superb...as are the rest of this brilliant cast.
B0072GPQ72|4.0|Great movie that shows a whole new aspect in a war time movie.<br />Emotional animal treatment areas but a must have to show war was hell.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is super super fun and awesome I like all the different things you get to do its really really fun
B0050SYS5A|3.0|This is a great add-on and is essential for close quarter apartments if you travel yours around as I do.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A fun and heartwarming game that allows people of all ages the joys of owning their very own horse, even if only digital. Love it!
B003O86FMW|4.0|While a good book there were no surprises in this one. I would recommend the series but hope the next is more unique in the story line.
B0086700CM|5.0|Not only do I like this app but my 2yr old enjoys it to (even tho she don't get far) My cousin &amp; I try beating eachothers score
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I had read the book before seeing the movie, and expected to be somewhat disappointed with the movie, as is the case for many books turned into movies but I was absolutely in love with the movie! It probably is due to the fact that the author wrote the screenplay and directed the movie. Logan Lerman was phenomenal as Charlie. The movie stayed very true to the book, the only issue I had with it was that the letter format of the book didn't translate to the movie as well as I would have liked it, but I still loved the movie.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|Amazing story! Memoirs are my favorite to read but this one definitely tugged on my heart strings. Ishmael is a true survivor and hi story is one that should always be told!
B00AKCJB44|5.0|Really great songs on here! A lot of them were written for the film, which is really interesting and cool. Over all a great vibe and a fun listen.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love this book!  Colleen Hoover grips you right from the start.  Easy read and you can not put the book down
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it. its awesome.  its like having a real horse.  I can use this for hours and never put it down that its so fun. I love it.
B005VPRF0M|5.0|My son loves this.  Great lego product for any super heroes fan.  Many hours of enjoyment out of this toy.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This booklet provides concise and easy-to-follow directions for creating and submitting a manuscript for Kindle, assuming the reader is familiar with Microsoft Word's manuscript formating functions.  New Microword Word users might need additional help formating their manuscript in order to have it convert cleanly for Kindle.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Just what I needed to whind down at night. Kept me entertained for a few nights,I think I'm ready for the movie.
B0030MM68O|5.0|This is a good film about Iraq in that it's almost totally non-political. It simply follows events as they occur to one unit of Explosive Ordnance Disposal guys.<br /><br />The unusual thing about Hurt Locker is that it's made more in the style of a European film than an American movie. There is no portentous narrator doing cheesy voice-overs. Things are not painfully obvious. The director does not hang a neon sign over the important bits. You have to pay attention.<br /><br />And it has a great ending.<br /><br />I grew up in a military family. My step-father did 3 tours in Vietnam, and volunteered for a 6-month extension after the second tour. I know all too well that there is a certain military type who simply *cannot* stay away.<br /><br />This is not a happy film, or in any way a reassuring look at the Iraq war. But it is a very good look at what really goes on.
0756603749|5.0|Comprehensive and complete, well written in the beginning world of knots.  Ultimately any skill of this type boils down to how much practice you are willing to put into it.  This book will give you all you need to work with this group of knots, it is up to you to practice and enjoy the beauty and art of them.
B0012HF5NC|2.0|This was a cheesy film. It was composed of 90% gratuitous, jingoistic &#34;patriotic&#34; BS.<br /><br />I mean, if you're going to make a movie on a theme, (aliens invade the earth), that has been done so many hundred times before, you need to have *something* original to work with, and this film has nothing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Peers and katniss are doomed to the arena for a second time where they must survive again while snowboarders love for one another
B00B2V66VS|4.0|my godchildren  have been playing the first game for a while. they like this one better for its  3-d like effects and yhe fact they can earn more avitars.
B008VNIBFO|5.0|Everyone knows the movie is amazing. Just wanted to say that the BluRay is spectacular. The picture is crystal clear and the sound is polished. Never seen or heard it better. One of the very best transfers of a B&W film available. it's stunning and a must have for enthusiasts.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Get this I love it so much I am so happy with it better graphics mines silliness more colorfulness and follow official_shatter on instagram
B00511PTWM|2.0|Works so-so.  Allows power to be transfered but if you bump it, it loses power because it does not fit snugly in the outlet socket.
B002M7A79S|3.0|The campy series had a sense of humor to it.  This was far too serious, and it still took forever to get the young girl to reveal her true powers.  It could have been so much more fun.  But at least it wrapped things up for people who followed the short-lived series.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My husband plays it non-stop.  He is obsessed to complete each level successfully.  I have lost my Kindle to him.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love love love this series!!!<br />I suggest this book to anyone who loved the first one! It's so good.. I finished it in five days :)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My young boys love it.  I like the fact that they can upgrade with out $$.  It seems like the music gets louder as they play though.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Wow! This was the first book that I could not stop reading!  If I didn't have kids and other errands to run I would have finished it in one day but I stayed up until I only had the last 100 pages and could not wait to wake up and finish! I can't wait to read Walking Disaster now! Thank you for your writing!
B0082GQ5HG|5.0|We are fans of animated movies and this one is great for the whole family! It is a unique story about a pirate captain and his crew who are really too sweet to be pirates and their desire to win the pirate of the year award. Fun! Entertaining! Silly! Unique! We love the claymation style!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game play it all the time!!! really great way to pass the time &iexcl;!!!  such great detail and different activities
B00993FEUK|5.0|To begin, I should mention that my family cannot stand scary movies and will not set foot near them. This movie is great! The characters are funny! The story is classic yet new. The stop motion is very well done. We loved the movie! But our favorite part was the behind the scenes bonus features... They went all out on the behind the scenes showing how passionate they are about their work. So much passion goes into each character and each grain of dirt!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|If you are I to Led Zeppelin and never been to thier concert then this is the next best thing. Jimmy Page is at the top of his game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved the way the story was told from two different viewpoints.  Also it kept you guessing about what was really happening.  Interesting main characters.
B009MO5960|2.0|I am not going to pretend to be some kind of drama critic. I am not gonna give a *spoiler* or *no spoiler* alert. Frankly, this movie can't have a *spoiler* alert, because a movie would have to have a PLOT to deserve a \\"spoiler warning\\". I will never recover my time or money after purchasing and watching this movie. I give it 2 stars because there are worse movies out there, like the \\"Zombieland\\" spoof/ripoff movie. (I don't remember the title and I don't want to remember the title)  This ResEvil movie really wasted major opportunity to use and involve the actors of past episodes.....really wasted....completely wasted. It blows my mind that so much money can be put into the production of a movie (more money than a working stiff like me will make in a lifetime)and still have a pile of canon fodder come out as the result. (I can't say foul expletives here so \\"fodder\\" will have to do)
B000NY12CI|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend, when I told her I had just finished reading &#34;Dietrich Bonhoeffer:  Pastor Prophet Martyr Spy.&#34;  Oddly enough, the two have a few things in common  - about groups of people that want to take over control of the world.  Bonheoffer moves deeper into his religion, following the Prince of Peace, (and is a historical account of things past), and Ayaan moves farther from her religion, away from Sharia Law and the idea of jihad, (and is a recent historical account of things still ocurring today).  Infidel is a primer for those who have not been following Radical Islam; it is a seemingly non-political book that can launch you into your own study of Radical Islam.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|this is a good app. way better than the hoarse site. i am glad I found it. cheers to all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|pretty rad! It sucks that the rate for gems is so expensive :( Id do the survey stuff for gems but once again, some of the stuff I gotta buy and no way
B002M9WW30|5.0|Although the fifth film isn't so good, the rest if the films/the whole saga is one of merit.  Great collection and purchased at a great price.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|My 10 year old son loved this book. He said it was funny and exciting. He is looking forward to reading the other books in the series
B0095XPZBC|5.0|Thankfully this arrived on Blu-Ray!  Great TV series and legacy.  I took advantage of the Christmas sales and pre-ordered this at a great price.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Truly addictive. Love it. This is a fun game, wish that..coins accumulated faster. Oh well. In the<br /><br />Meantime I will play play play.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I really enjoyed this MIB.  It is rare to have a sequal outdo it predecesors but MIBS does it in an amazingly interesting and plausable way.  If you like MIB, you will like this,  IF you love MIB, You will love MIB3.  If you didn't like MIB but watched them anyway, my bet is that you will like this one and be glad you watched the others too.
B001HN697M|5.0|I loved this movie and wanted it for my collection. I would suggest this to anyone who enjoys the Underword movies!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is amazing and exciting. but I wish it would have more characters. SO IF YPU DONT HAVE THIS GAME GET IT!!!!!!!
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|This was the first I had seen of this movie, BUT I adore all of the Underworld movies...This I think is the best so far!!!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is a great movie, keep in mind the language is not for younger kids despite the singing nature of the movie.  It is a great one if you love music or drama.
B000000OMP|5.0|great cd, a little better than the mainstream radio friendly (follow up) whitsnake cd. a cd where you don't need to skip a song. excellently produced with a lot of raw energy and probably the best musician lineup this band ever had. a definte pickup for your music collection.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|If you need to laugh until you cry, give this book a try.  I will not disappoint you or your younger audience.
B00AC8ZJPQ|1.0|This is one of worst movies I have ever seen. Poor acting and story line. Don't waste your money on this.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its fun but it clutches a lot a does not let you use the save me gem twice. but all in good game
B007KZY1YY|4.0|A good trilogy that gets better with each book.  An easy read with a decent story line to go with all the sexy.
0307279189|5.0|Just to add to all the glowing reviews, I just love this book! I think we are onto 11 copies now that we have bought and given to people as gifts (which goes down really well by the way).<br /> As a 'non-runner' I was really surprised that I wanted to take up running after reading Born to Run.<br />And I want to thank the author so much for his insight into why running shoes hurt us not help us.<br />After reading the book my partner and I put away our expensive running shoes, and used our bare feet or homemade shoes (google it, there is heaps of info on line, you don't have to buy the expensive five finger shoes).<br />But we did start in summer, winter was a bit more tricky, until I tried reef shoes. Made with rubber, similar to booties, but look like regular flat ballet shoes, no arch support, flexible, and they breathe and you can wear socks under them for the chilly days.<br />I wore them for 5 months and no one commented on the fact that they weren't shoes, they just blend in, and are cheap to buy.<br />One last tip...don't be discouraged when you start barefoot running if you get sore legs or feet, its just your muscles adapting to the new style.<br />And start SLOWLY, just walking a few km per day, no running, I over did it the first week and then started slow, now I can run no worries, and I have SO MUCH MORE ENERGY, can't stress that enough. If you work on your feet like I do, then half way through the day take your shoes off and see how you feel, for me its like have a shot of caffine, I am suddenly awake again.<br />Anyway, thank you for this book, it has helped improve our lives immensely.
B009X01C64|4.0|Nice functional product to keep the Kindle Fire HD safe. Works well, the rotation is stiff at first but with time it have loosen a bit so it is easier now to swivel.  I would recommend this product to friends and family.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Good Stuff Good Stuff.18 more words required. 18 more words required. 18 more words required. 18 more words required. 18 more words required.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this game today and Ive been playing at least 2 hours straght. In 30 minuttes I had 700 coined. I love this gam
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|While this book explores a child's life, it has lessons to teach all of us.  We can see the importance of acceptance, of looking beyond the books cover and honesty.  It tells the story from several points of view and helps us to see the whole person.  Yes, it is heart warming and a tearjerker but it does have an important message.<br />Parents, read &#34;Wonder&#34;  with your children. my husband, a Forth Grade teacher is reading it to his students and they can't wait for the next chapter.
