B00002Z88D|5.0|Despite claims in the editorial reviews and some of the reviews below mine, this is NOT a greatest hits album. There is no way it could be. It doesn't even have \\"The Unforgiven\\" on it, give me a break. And it doesn't even include songs from all their albums, which would at least have to be true for a greatest hits album. So don't buy it if you're looking for the very best songs metallica has ever written, because this is not it. However, this is a FANTASTIC cd. Some of the songs are even better then the originals (\\"One\\" and \\"Until It Sleeps\\" come to mind). The orchestra mixed with the drum and the guitars offers a unique experiance that one would be an idiot to pass up, especially if you are a Metallica fan. <br /> <br />SO BUY IT NOW! IT\\"S METALLICA FOR GOSH SAKES!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|This cd is so awesome. I loved every song on it! And it's rare for me to like all songs on one single cd! I highly recommend this if you like nice relaxing music.
B00000K19E|5.0|My dad made me watch this movie, there was something about it that I didn't want to see. But as soon as it was on T.V. I couldn't keep my eyes off it. The special effects were great, probably the best ever. The story is pretty interesting. Makes you wonder what's gonna happen next. It's a good movie. <br /> <br />
B000002LQR|5.0|Blood Sugar Sex Magik is, has been, and always will be the Red Hot Chili Peppers' best album. What else can I say that others have not? I can only say that this and Californication are the best albums to start with the Peppers. Here is a rundown on the songs: <br /> <br />The Power of Equality: 10/10 - Hard rocking, one of the best album openers ever. <br />If You Have to Ask: 10/10 - an amazing blend of rap, funk, and the high pitched vocals in the chorus are amazing. <br />Breaking the Girl: 10/10 - a break from the fast-paced madness of the first songs. A sweet ballad that is one of my favorites on Blood Sugar Sex Magik. <br />Funky Monks: 10/10 - this song has one hell of a bassline! <br />Suck My Kiss: 10/10 - this was one of the first Peppers' songs I heard, and it still holds a place in my heart. It makes me laugh all the time! <br />I Could Have Lied: 9/10 - a song similar to Breaking the Girl, with some great vocals by Anthony Kiedis. <br />Mellowship Slinky in B Major: 10/10 - a really funky track, and one of the best. <br />The Righteous and the Wicked: 10/10 - This song took a while to grow on me, but I am glad. Another perfect track. <br />Give it Away: 10/10 - Arguably their most popular song with some fun lyrics, some pretty cool guitar effects and a KILLER bassline. <br />Blood Sugar Sex Magik: 9/10 - a worthy title track! <br />Under the Bridge: 10/10 - now this is a great track. The Red Hot Chili Peppers would use this type of style in albums like Californication and By the Way more often than their funky songs. One of my favorite songs ever. <br />Naked in the Rain: 9/10 - what can I say? Another good track. <br />Apache Rose Peacock: 9/10 - a fast-paced song with some sexual lyrics. <br />The Greeting Song: 9/10 - another track that took a while to grow on me, but it is killer. <br />My Lovely Man: 7/10 - I do consider this the low point of an otherwise amazing album. It is not a bad track by any means, though I cannot put my finger on it...I just don't like it that much! <br />Sir Psycho Sexy: 10/10 - some of the rawest, funkiest, dirtiest music I have ever heard. The lyrics of this song make you feel so unclean that you might have to take a bath afterwards, but it is such a devilish song and a great one at that. It has one of the most fantastic endings of a Red Hot Chili Peppers song ever. <br />They're Red Hot: 8/10 - this is just a weird outro jam, and while others might think it is a joke or whatever, I kind of like it! It is fun to listen to. <br /> <br />Overall: 9.5/10 <br />Grade: A <br /> <br />I treasure this album, and I always will. Go buy this album if you like to hear raw, vulgaric, beautiful, and powerful music. Highly recommended.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|It's been 30 years since going to the Record Bar and hearing Boston blasting out of some (Bose probably) speakers hanging on the wall.  It didn't take with me at first and then it did and then they were just overplayed and over exposed.  Fast forward to summer of '78 and Boston is out on tour with Van Halen and the Outlaws doing that O'rena Rock thing.  They played a gig in the local college football bowl and damn near if not, blew VH off the stage.  Pipe organ et al. <br /> <br />Never owned the records and never played them on the air as a college radio DJ.  We were far to progressive and hip for that.  Fast forward a lifetime and I read that these discs are out as a Tom Scholz remaster.  The guy was just way ahead of his time. A genius for sure.  They don't let knuckle heads into MIT.  A guy from my high school with a perfect SAT score and an AF scholarship, flunked out and followed a Bhagwan around the globe for a while. <br /> <br />These discs are excellent.  Guitars everywhere.  Very high production values.  Pristine sound except for the original distortion.  Bass guitar parts get better sounding and louder as you go thru both discs in running order.  Kind of buried in the mix in the first few cuts.  Minor quibles.  If you are a Boston fan you will have to have these discs.  If you are 16 years old and wonder what all the fuss was about, you at least need to hear these discs and decide for yourself.  Air guitar lessons will be the next step.
B000050HTO|5.0|Essential, from the word \\"essence\\"!  There's no claim that it will cover 34 years of music history, so don't listen to people who complain that it doesn't cover enough. It's the essence of Dylan and it's great as it is; essentially excellent music from one of the greatest singer-song writers ever.  If you want something more \\"in depth\\" get \\"No Direction Home\\", the documentary and soundtrack cover it all. Also, \\"Essential Bob Dylan\\" isn't just for beginners.  I grew up a Dylan fan and I still am. I love the album.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This soundtrack is, without a doubt, a masterpiece that will always be rembered as a monument in Broadway history!
B00003CXI1|2.0|=+= Opening Statements =+=  <br /> <br />Harry Potter:And the Sorcerors stone, takes after the book by J.K. Rowling. The book was excelent, the movie was not.  <br /> <br />=+= Plot =+=  <br /> <br />This movie, as do the books, take after the life of Harry Potter, a wizard that lives with his aunt and uncle along with with his cousin Dudley. Ok, they got that part right...but they keep on keepinbg out key sceans. Like the part when Snape refs Harry's Quiditch game. And, the parts that they DID keep in were pretty poorly done. Many parts had a lot of attemps at comedy, but they did not succed. Also, the animation was TERRIBLE. Play Station 1 graphics were better then that! But, they did keep on the plot pretty good so..  <br /> <br />Plot score: 2-5  <br /> <br />=+= Cast =+=  <br /> <br />Let me start out by saying, that the actors that are showing their true colors now, were terrible back then. Danaile Radcliff plays Harry, poorly at that. He is AWSOME today...but terrible in the first one. Same with Emma Watson and Rupurt Grint, AWSOME actors/actress now, terrible back then. Richard Harris did an AWSOME job (as usual) in his role as Dumbledore. Also Allen Rickman as Snape did awsome. Not sure if it was the writing, or just their acting skills, but the acting did poorly, except Richard Harris and Allen Rickman, so..  <br /> <br />Casting score:1-5  <br /> <br />=+= Music =+=  <br /> <br />John Williams was very famous for his music in such films as Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan, and War of the Worlds, came back to do Harry Potter, and boy did he deliver. The music in this movie was very well done. The theme was very good, and also he made the music as it went along with the movie so...  <br /> <br />Music:5-5  <br /> <br />=+= Closing Statements =+=  <br /> <br />Harry Potter: And the Sorcerors Stone, a poor movie off of a perfect book. Is that what J.K. Rowling gets for all her hard work in making the books? I was really board in this movie and I had thought that reading words from pages was a lot funner, then looking at images on a screan. Though SOME actors were good, and the music was excelent, you cant just live off of those two things.  <br /> <br />Final Score: 2-5  <br /> <br /> <br />BTW..JustThinkin is me..I needed a new account
B00009W0U4|4.0|I should start by saying don't let the practically naked woman on the cover of the DVD / VCR case fool you, this is not erotica.  The rape scene made me cringe and I'm a guy - not to sound male chauvinist or anything but I can only imagine how horrifying it would be for a woman to watch this movie (actually this would be a great movie for any young man to watch only because if the man has even a sliver of a conscience it should help prevent him from participating in any date-rape situations in the future - in that sense I would go so far as to say this film is required viewing only to show people just how horrific rape really is and, much as I hate the idea of scaring women, also to show young women just how dangerous it is to put themselves in situations where they could be at risk).  Don't assume that the other reviewers who have said the same thing are being overly sensitive or too politically correct either - I'm dead serious the rape scene is horrifyingly, horrifyingly graphic.  That's pretty much the only \\"sex\\" scene so to speak (and I use the word loosely there) so again, this is not erotica if you're looking for that rent a porn movie instead.  Having said that I was moved by this film - the fact that I was horrified shows that it had an effect on me, which is what any good film should do.  If you're a fan of say, Law and Order- Special Victims Unit for example and want to see stories about the real life monsters (e.g. rapists, molesters and so forth) you'll probably like this film.  I was very disappointed that the rapist (I know I'm overusing the word but I'll use it again - horrifyingly depicted as a depraved, chilling utter evil wretch of a human being, regardless of whether or not he was high on drugs at the time) didn't get what was coming to him, the [...] made a clean getaway - it adds to the overall \\"scariness\\" (for lack of a better word) of the film, it's all too sad but no doubt very true that scum like this guy avoid punishment for their deeds out in the \\"real\\" world as well. Ultimately that's what makes the film effective and what makes you feel like you've been punched in the gut after watching it - it's a depiction of what can, and probably does, happen out here in the \\"real\\" world.
B00005JNRY|5.0|=+= Opening Statements =+=  <br /> <br />In June 2006, Pixar came out with this film that seemed to be made by the racing gods from heaven. Never had I been excited for a pixar movie in my whole life. Directed by John Lasseter and Joe Ranfit, staring Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, and many many more. Plus I got a kick out of all the celebraty voices featureing Jay Leno, Richard Petty, Darrel Waltrip, Dale Earnhardt Jr, Michael Schumacher, and Mario Andretti. Thank You for reading my opening shpeal and now...I will continue.  <br /> <br />=+= Plot =+=  <br /> <br />The story is about a fast talkin' racecar named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson). He is living life on the fast lane, he's very popular, and he is about to be the first rookie to win the Piston Cup. But, due to a three-way tie in the standings, there has to be a three-man race for the Piston Cup. On the way to the track, McQueen ends out fallign out of his trailer and left for himself on the highway. He somehow finds himself helping re-build a road he destroyed in the little town of Radiator springs. There he meets up with many new friends, like Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and Sally (Bonnie Hunt). McQueen soon learns to take it easy, and slow it down some in this little town. The plot is very well done, and the story of how Radiator Springs came off the map was very well made.  <br /> <br />Plot Score: 5-5  <br /> <br />=+= Casting =+=  <br /> <br />The casting in this film was perfect. Owen Wilson leading it off with many different talents behind him, such as the legendary Paul Newman, and the very funny John Ratzenberger. Plus with all of the gguest stars, this shaped up to be perfect acting.  <br /> <br />Casting score: 5-5  <br /> <br />=+= Music =+=  <br /> <br />The soundtrack in this movie was excellent. Featureing the song \\"Route 66\\" by Chuck Berry and John Mayor. Also \\"Real Gone\\" by Sheryl Crow. And my personal favorite \\"Life is a Highway\\" by Rascal Flatts. And many many more. Excelent movie soundtrack and in a way, pretty humours for the Cow Tipping part.  <br /> <br />Music: 5-5  <br /> <br />=+= Final Thoughts =+=  <br /> <br />This has to be the best movie that pixar has ever came up with. The humor in this was way up there, and mix that in with great music, and a great cast and crew and what do you have? *Cars* thats what you have. Plus you have an absoulute funny afterward thing with some pixar films CARS style. This movie is perfect for the whole family, and also for all NASCAR fans, you will LOVE this one.  <br /> <br />Final Score: 5-5 <br /> <br /> <br />BTW: Just Thinkin is me...I needed a new account.
B000EQ5TSI|4.0|Yeah, I know. It's so easy to 'dis this flick. And hey, the first time I saw it, I was not a huge fan either. However, I happened to catch this movie again the other day.<br /><br />Now, I am of the opinion that a movie's first and foremost job is to entertain -- not to enlighten, not to inform, not to make us feel more intellectual because we have plowed the shadowy depths of a film's varied and multi-layered philisophical underpinnings. If a movie fails to entertain, then it has failed utterly. I don't care how successful it is on any other front.<br /><br />MI2 is a very entertaining movie. You can't take your eyes off of it. The action is completely engaging and there's just enough plot and dialogue in between. I know, I know; you guys all want to look cool and agree with the rest of the sheeple, er, filmgoers by dismissing this flick as mere fluff, but if you're looking for any sort of depth from this sort of fare, what in tarnation were you thinking???<br /><br />This movie is entertaining, therefore it succeeds.
B00005JOSS|4.0|It's hard to say anything about the plot of this movie, that you can't have already gotten from a trailer, without giving away the ending. Sandra Bullock plays Kate Forster, a young doctor just starting her career, having moved to the city after living in a glass house built over a lake in the country. When she moves, she leaves a note for the next resident of the house explaining a few small details and asking him to forward her mail. Alex Wyler, played by Keanu Reeves, is a youngish architect building cookie-cutter condos. He's the son of a famous, if not family-oriented, architect and their relationship makes for an interesting sub-plot. Alex moves into the house and by way of letters exchanged via the same mailbox, he and Kate realize they are two people living two years apart. The long-distance romance that ensues is expected, and at some points in the movie the producers spare the viewer from having to listen to Alex read Kate's letters in monotone and instead put the two side-by-side where they carry on a conversation as if they were actually in the same room.  <br /> <br />In The Lake House, Bullock delivers a solid, if less-than-stellar performance. No one is going to remember her for this movie, though they might remember Reeves, if only because it was something different for him. There is one very touching scene where she realy connects with the audience and I think many  will relate to her \\"bird in the hand\\" situation surrounding a past love interest.   <br /> <br />Reeves, ah Keanu...the recipient of many a criticism. I personally feel that Keanu isn't so much a bad actor, as he is a poor emoter. Once you accept that this is the way he is as a real person, I think it's easier to accept his acting style. Regardless, it's good to see Keanu doing something that doesn't involve a highwire and kung-fu. I think anti-Keanu viewers will be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br />I only give this 4 stars instead of five because it tended to bog down in a few places.Overall though, it was a good movie, even for a date-night. <br /> <br />
B000BTJDGC|3.0|Don't get me wrong: the acting, the script, everything was done really well. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it was simply disturbing. This movie BOTHERED me. I don't get scared of movies easily, but this movie truly scared me. That night I woke up at 3 a.m. and that really scared me. I had to watch an hour of Conen to get me back to sleep. I don't think I ever want to watch this movie again. During Christmas, my cousins, sister, and best friend rented this movie...I had to go to bed early because I wouldn't watch it.
B000E97Y6K|2.0|The story of King Kong is so simple that a 7-minute miniepisode of The Simpsons tells as much story as Peter Jackson's 3-hour movie.  But we all know the story anyway - Jackson's challenge is to bring modern filmmaking techniques to the story and to give us something we've never seen before.  Certainly, his recreation of 1930's NYC is impressive, and his Kong is amazing.  Unfortunately, that is where my praise for the film ends (except to mention Jack Black's performance, which was a treat to watch). <br /> <br />There are a lot of details that I could go into as to why I consider Jackson's film to be failure.  None of these would be fatal on their own, and in fact most would be quickly forgiven in an engaging film.  But therein lies the problem - this film is not engaging.  In fact, it's somewhat dull.  This is not the director that brought out such wonderful and subtle performances in the LotR trilogy but rather the director of B-level horror films like Braindead.  There is simply too much action over too long a time, and the brain tunes out.  The story is made to showcase the abilities of the special effects, rather than the effects serving the needs of the story. <br /> <br />Even then the effects are not the best I've seen.  How this film won an Oscar when Star Wars III wasn't even nominated is offensive!  As I mentioned, Kong himself is very impressive, but nothing else in the film matches that achievement.  This would not be a problem if the filmakers were aiming for a stylised cartoon-like vision.  But Kong's realism serves to highlight the inadequacies of the rest of the film.  Most damaging are the scenes on the water (see: Master and Commander for how a boat should look at sea!), the dinosaurs (that are no better than Spielberg's in Jurassic Park, now 12 years old!), and the actors' performances (who look like they are staring off into space rather than looking at something). <br /> <br />But basically it all comes down to the fact that there is too little story and no reason to tell it.  The scenes on Skull Island seem endless, and endlessly similar, as we see dinosaurs attacking the ship's crew, then fighting Kong, then fighting Kong some more, then attacking Ann Darrow, then fighting Kong, then.... but you get the idea.  Oddly, the first hour (setting up the expedition) was widely derided by the critics, but is really the only part of the film worth watching. <br /> <br />This DVD edition is actually quite nice, with the expected full-spread of extras.  The extras might even be better than those on the LotR special editions - certainly they are tighter and more eye-catching for the casual viewer.  The film looks and (especially) sounds great.  Too bad there is no real reason to own the film.  Or even to see it.
B000002OVJ|5.0|This is personally my favorite live album ever as the entire group gives a very memorable performance.  Some tracks i really enjoy are can't explain, magic bus,and im a boy.  Please disregard the comments of the reviewer below me as he is most likely into emo music.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|I have listened to decemberunderground, though I have yet to purchase it.  I think there needs to be some clarification about this album.  I like the \\"old school\\" AFI sound as much as anyone. I am, however, glad that they have evolved musically from the purest punk rock of the early to mid 90's sound into a more musically complex sound.  They are experimenting with different beats, pushing their limits, finding out what works and what doesn't.  The bottom line is this: this is a good record.  It isn't a rehash of Black Sails or Proud of Ya, but I for one am glad.  If you want to listen to the old AFI sound, listen to an old AFI record. <br /> <br />also, the reason that Davey's scream is different than it has been in the past is because he had vocal problems that no longer allow him to get into the register that he used to.  People that say he's a sellout or whatever because he doesn't scream the same way that he used to need to do their homework before they trash him.
B00005JNNZ|5.0|\\"Coach Carter,\\" transcends well beyond just another emotional sports story. Samuel L. Jackson provides the inspiration to a bunch of high school students, whose only interest in life is playing basketball and getting into trouble. Coming from very humble backgrounds, the characters in this film have led a life of poverty and despair. They are talented, but unmotivated basketball players and have little to no interest in school work. Coach Carter puts an end to that by shutting down the basketball court until all of the basketball players have attained an acceptable grade point average. By teaching the ball players that life exists beyond the basketball court, he inspires them to become better students, so that they will be able to live a better life. By setting extremely high expectations of his students, he instills in them the qualities that will not only make them better ball players, but provide them with the skills and motivation to become better individuals and to excel at whatever it is that they desire to do with their lives. Watching a bunch of spoiled losers transform into a bunch of confident winners, provides the inspiration that is so lacking in many of today's young people. This movie should be required viewing for all high school students, and adults would benefit from watching it too. \\"Coach Carter,\\" is an outstanding film and among one of my all time favorites.
B00005QEO1|4.0|This album contians some classics such as \\"Love In An Elevator\\", \\"What It Takes\\", and the underrated \\"F.I.N.E\\". No Aerosmith fan should be without it.<br /><br />The Guns N Roses fan must not have listened to this closley. No Solos? Has he ever heard Love In An Elevator?
0061020710|4.0|I'm not going to write much of a review for this book since there are plenty of people who have already raved about it. I am merely another review to add to the pile of good reviews. Submerged in a magical realm which resembles our own world and culture, the Discworld series holds a lot of promise in terms of humor, satire, and simple stupid fun. It's hard to say more about a book than that, given that these are basically the author's aims. He shoots for a solid ground of silly entertainment and hits his target well. Similar to Douglass Adams in a lot of ways, I find I enjoy Pratchett more. <br /> <br />I give this book 4 stars as opposed to 5 because it's not the sort of book that you equate with a classic, which is what I consider a 5 star book. Even as I say that, I liked it well enough to walk to the bookstore at my lunch hour and buy the second book of the series to take on my vacation. That's saying something, as I rarely buy new books. Given that Amazon used offers this book for $1.61, the fact I went to the bookstore speaks volumes. <br /> <br />Pratchett has now pumped out 30-35 in this series and they continue to get high marks. It's safe to say this is likely going to be the start of a an enjoyable run of reading. A mere 200+ pages in length (are you listening David Foster Wallace?), the book sails by and can easily be read in a day. I try to make it a habit to not consume books that fast as my wallet frowns on the practice. But these hold so much promise I'm excited to have found this author.  <br /> <br />One blurb I read said that Pratchett is like Vonnegut, Adams, and Hiaasen. While I would put him below Vonnegut, who I consider brilliant, he's better than Hiaasen and more smooth & subtle than Adams. If you like these writers, I think it's safe to say that you'll like Pratchett.
B000FBGBPC|3.0|I would probably give this album a 3.5 out of five. It is a good CD overall, and include a mixture of slower and harder songs. No doubt fans of Three Days Grace will love it. But don't go out and but it for the song 'Animal I've Become'. If you arn't the kind of person who goes shopping for one song, then check out all the other songs first, as you may get disapointed. There is a fair amount of swearing in 'One X' for those who care. A varity of different swear words. For those wondering, f word, s word, d word all are used as far as I heard. There could be more.  <br />My final conclusion is that if you like the band and don't care about any swearing, get this album. <br />If you like one song and don't know much about the band, I suggest checking out the other songs before you buy the CD. <br /> <br />
0312330871|5.0|And Then There Were None is my all time favorite Christie book. In fact, it's the only book of hers that I actually like. I don't normally care for her stories with Ms. Marple or the  Inspector Poirot. This mystery was filled with many twists and red herrings,all the while not becoming confusing. It kept you guessing till the end. Maybe that is why I prefer this mystery. It is different than all the rest!
B000ELIVB0|4.0|kinda avant gard, coilish clean synth and spaceyness. bjorkish lyrical choices. vocal distortions and gimmicks(thank god).Will always listen to this c.d. and will look forward to listening to it during winter and depressions. na na na. agree with other reviewers that the brother and sister duo do things vocally like nina haggins does. monsterish and free. this album reminds me of blackout drinking, molesters and...no, thats enough. I love 'cold cuts' ten bagazillion times more though.
B000000XCD|5.0|I am a huge fan of John Fogerty's solo music and his music with CCR.

B0000064TT|5.0|I've always thought this is the best instrumental rock album ever recorded, as much because of Ken Scott's production as because of the band. (Scott lended similar brilliance to The Tubes, Jeff Beck, Missing Persons, and many others, and the Dregs were never the same to me without him.) I adore every track to this day, even though I still think the title track sounds like a beer commercial.

B000F7CMRM|4.0|Picture this: a multi-national merger of two giant American oil companies; an oil producing Arab nation that needs to cut a deal to ensure its survival in the global marketplace; a hot shot energy analyst who is in it for the money; a washed up CIA agent on one last mission, and an impoverished Pakistani oil worker who is told he no longer has a job.     These are just some of the scenarios playing out in writer/director Stephen Gaghan's incendiary Syriana, a fierce meditation on the marriage of geo-politics, business, oil and money. The plot is complicated and occasionally confuses, and the film is often overly didactic, abstract and muddled - sometimes to the point of incoherence - but with all its faults, Syriana really manages to convince you that this is how global power really works.    The announcement that an oil-rich, but struggling, emirate in the Persian Gulf has transferred drilling rights from Connex, a giant Texas firm, to the higher-bidding People's Republic of China sets of a firestorm throughout the global reigns of power. A number of people are instantly affected, all at different ends of the geopolitical spectrum. Connex owner Jimmy Pope (Chris Cooper) decides to merge with a smaller company called Killen to offset the merger.     Killen has acquired the drilling rights to a rich field in Kazakhstan. But the American Justice Department lead by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) are suspect and employ Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright), a smooth, controlled Washington lawyer to watch over the union.     Meanwhile, Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon), an energy analyst who lives with his wife, Julie (Amanda Peet) and their two sons in posh Geneva, suddenly finds himself becoming an advisor to the idealistic, sophisticated Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig). Bryan is after Nasir to build a pipeline through Iran and export his oil to Europe because there's big money to be made and Bryan is convinced it will benefit the Emirate.     Wasim Kahn (Mazhar Munir) is a poor Pakistani oil field worker employed by Connex in the Emirate who loses his job when the firm loses those drilling rights to the Chinese. He finds solace in one of the many madras's that are springing up around the country and is eventually invited to join an elite group for training as a suicide bomber.     And then there's veteran CIA field operative Bob Barnes (George Clooney), a used and beaten down intelligence agent who speaks Arabic and Farsi and is always involved in insalubrious clandestine operations. Barnes gets drawn into what is happening in the Emirate and his life is placed in danger.     Although these characters never formerly meet, yet they are linked in totally logical ways as Gaghan morphs together the issues of big business, oil and terrorism. This movie won't be for everyone, the narrative is terribly conceptual and opaque with much of the dialogue consisting of furtive double-speak - suddenly we are dropped right into the middle of situations, enter rooms after the action has started, and hear conversations that have already begun, and the film is edited in such a way that characters drift in and out of the story at a moments notice.      Perhaps the best option is to enjoy the film's individual dramatic elements as they whiz by and hope that it all gels in the end, which in many respects it does. Of course George Clooney one the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for playing Bob, and it was well deserved too, but the performances in Syriana really do play second fiddle to the issues and this incredible sense that there's some kind of underhanded conspiracy going on that we as average citizens have little control over.      In the end, the movie challenges us to be a type of fly on the wall, witnessing America's controversial foreign policy as all the shady power brokers from the government to big business direct and deal, and gradually pull the strings that control the flow of oil and money backwards and forwards from the Middle East to the West.Mike Leonard June 06.

B000063UR2|5.0|I was lucky enough to have experienced this film in the movie theater when it was first released in the 80's. Back then I didn't know anything about a European version or cut scenes, I simply enjoyed it for what it was, a great fantasy film. I recall seeing it several times and discovering something new each time, it's just one of those movies you never get tired of seeing because the visuals are so stunning. The plot is quite simple, and let's face it, a bit cliched, with the whole \\"good vs evil\\" and the stealing (and search) of the magic unicorn horn. <br />The standout here is the art direction, the movie was entirely filmed on a movie set, yet it doesn't feel like it, the forest really looks like a forest and the demon Darkness' lair feels vast and cavernous. The design for the demon Darkness is one of the all time best make up jobs in cinema history. Even though there is nothing left of actor Tim Curry's face or body he manages to infuse his character with a great deal of expression and personality. The design for the goblin Blix doesn't fare as well because it does look like a rubber mask with little expression other than a scowl. Tom Cruise in one of his early roles offers a rather hammy performance but maybe that's what the character called for. A very young Mia Sara looks like she was born to play the role of a princess because she's just so stunningly beautiful. Her scenes with the demon Darkness are a highlight of this film. <br />This 2 disc edition really surpasses the previous 1 disc edition by far. For starters, you get the European cut with the Goldsmith score and the US version with the very different Tangerine Dream score. My favorite among the many extars included is the video for Bryan Ferry's song Is Your Love Strong Enough, a great song and a great video. Very reccomended.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|I have to admit, I have not been with this band since the beginning. In fact, the only reason that I ever became interested in this band was because of the song, \\"Bat Country\\", on Madden NFL 2006's soundtrack. I didnt think any of the other songs on this album could surpass \\"Bat Country\\". But boy, thank God I did pick up this CD, because so many of them did, even though it still is a great song. As the title mentions, you will find hardly ANY screaming on this album. Actually, I'd be willing to bet that a single track off of their debut or sophomore album has more screaming than this entire disc does. The songs on \\"City of Evil\\" have tons more to offer, considering that on average they are about 6 or 7 minutes. Avenged Sevenfold are finally displaying the great musical talent that they have. The only thing about this album is that Shadows does not have NEARLY as good as a singing voice live as he does on this album. Other than that, the guitar duo is great alongside the constant in-your-face drumming of The Rev. Here are some of my favorites :    1. Beast And The Harlot - A tremendous way to open an outstanding album. The beginning will have you so pumped for the rest of the song. I liked the chorus of this song so much that I went online and downloaded a ringtone of it for my phone.  2. Burn Tt Down - The best example on the album of how much Avenged Sevenfold have grown musically. So many different great riffs and harmonies in this track.  3. Blinded In Chains - A flat-out rocker. This one is packed with great lyrics, and can you say double-bass drumming? The Rev struts his stuff here.  5. Trashed And Scattered - It seems like 3 different songs, or movements, packed into one. This is my favorite right here, because it just has so much to offer.  7. Sidewinder - The riffs will grab your attention on this song. The bridge is really neat too, but my favorite part of this song is at the end when things go acoustic and almost Latin American for about 2 minutes.  9. Strength Of The World - There's an old western feel for the first part of this track. I especially appreciate the solid guitar solo just before things change up and seem to go into a different song.    So, here's the verdict, If you loved how the old Avenged Sevenfold used to sound, you probably won't dig the sound they're going for on this album. In my opinion, they're progressing musically, which always makes for a better career. I find myself very anxious for this band's next album, probably the most anxious I've ever been for an upcoming CD. Of course, I guess I'm more anxious for Lamb of God's, \\"Sacrament\\", but that's beside the point. DONT MISS OUT, pick up \\"City of Evil\\". Thank you for your time.

B00008BXJF|5.0|I have to admit that even after reading the rave reviews, I had low expectations of this album. The ConstruKction of Light, while quite good, had a drumming style a bit too busy and frenetic for me. I thought Bruford's absence would be too much twice in a row, but Mr. Mastelotto got it much better this time. I almost don't miss Bruford. <br />The album itself is fantastic, everything you'd expect from KC, but in unexpected ways, and then some more, which is one of the reasons why I like this band so much. In my opinion this album is as good as any other in KC's catalog. Yes, it is that good, even without Bruford and Levin (who by the way is now back in the band). Admittedly not as ground-breaking as the debut album, Larks' Tongues, or Red, but brilliant indeed. If you are into KC, don't wait.

B000F3AAUW|4.0|In one of the few instances in music, the hype is definitely well placed with the release of Cee-Lo's and \\"producer of the moment\\" Danger Mouses's collabo supreme \\"St. Elsewhere.\\" Having never really been a big Cee-Lo fan, but VERY mindful and admiring of his talent, I figured him linking up with one of the most ecclectic beatsmiths in the game in Danger Mouse (still bumpin that DangerDoom!), might be the vehicle he needed to both win me over, and establish himself to the general public as a factor in the landscape of music's future. The lead single \\"Crazy\\", has already made it's mark overseas, and people started to get wind of how truly dope this joint is in the subsequent weeks since it's release. But Crazy is just the tip of the iceberg. Clocking it at around 3 minutes or less, many of the songs on this album pack a serious punch without overextending their welcomes. \\"Smiley Faces\\" is absolutely my favorite song on the album, as Danger's psychedelic production is the perfect conduit for Cee-Lo's melodic wails. Hell, with that description I could pretty much describe the whole album! I seriously can bump Gnarls Barkley all day every day, probably because of the short length. Each song is like an interesting vignette, offering just a glimpse of Cee-Lo's writing abilities. Joints like \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\", \\"Just A Thought\\" and the incredulous opening track \\"Go-Go Gospel\\" blend the lines between R&B, alt-rock, and Gospel music something serious. This makes it that much harder to pigeonhole Gnarls. After numerous listens, I think that's exactly what they wanted.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The people who have given negative reviews are just being difficult. There's no way after five honest listens to this album that you can say it's bad or even mediocre. I think we're looking at history here, a top-five album of all time. The Beatles, Led Zep and Who have records up there too but don't leave you with that feeling of \\"Wow!!\\" after almost each song. <br /> <br />I've read complaints that the funk isn't as potent as it was 20 years ago. Again, give it several rotations, there's plenty of great funk but now it's much more refined and polished and fused with rock. RCHP have really matured as artists, these songs are complicated and advanced (and gorgeous). If you're more into the old stuff like \\"Fight Like a Brave\\" and \\"Knock Me Down\\", that's fine but it's more a refection of your simple taste than any shortcomings on this album. The evolution of this band has been amazing and so is \\"Stadium Arcadium\\".
1594481938|2.0|As a fan of High Fidelity, About a Boy and How to Be Good, I dove into A Long Way Down without reservation.  Unfortunately, it appears that Mr. Hornby has run out of ideas.  The plot (which I won't rehash here) is preposterous, the characters are preposterous, one dimensional constructs and after a while, one realizes that Mr. Hornby has not created characters but is using simple stereotypes to push this silly plot forward.  There is nothing to be learned from this book, the humor is stale and it does seem (as an earlier reviewer mentions) that Mr. Hornby is intent on simply turning out product.  His books are generally quite simply written and entertaining rather than aspiring to literary achievment.  But some growth would be expected at this point.  This book shows only regression and lack of interest.

B00005UEAR|4.0|When i think of Dream Theater i think of a great band with huge potential, who most of the time harness their potential and create wonderful music. But they also have moments of incredible neo-prog and mindless noise that doesn't suit the songs. <br /> <br />An example of this is the song 'Stream Of Consciousness' from Train Of Thought. It's a great song, but there are several moments where it loses itself in stupidity and childish noise. That is an instrumental song, so i will give another example for the singing. Songs like 'Honor Thy Father' have stupid and tiring verses, whereas 'Space Dye-Vest' and 'The Great Debate' have great singing. <br /> <br />Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence is the same, except here, it's not the songs that are variyng in crap/goodness, it's Disc 1 and Disc 2. <br /> <br />Disc 1: This disk is Five Star. The worst song on it is probably The Glass Prison, but it is still great. Blind Faith, The Great Debate and Misunderstood are brilliant, probably DT best. <br /> <br />Disc 2: I have no problem with prog, as long as it is used artfully and not in excess. Dream Theater's bad moments are simply when they go overboard with synthesizer and random noise. This whole disc is just horrible. There is not one bit of good music here. I thought, when i read the name 'Overture', that it was a random name to describe an epic song - (42 min. long) - but it is really a literal translation. This disc is just a bunch of incoherant, operatic, junk. It sounds like Ayreon except more operatic. It has barely any rock moments in it, and although DT often achieve brilliant acoustic songs, these are pure crap. <br /> <br />So this album is a confusing one. Disc 1: 5 stars, Disc 2: 1 star. I wonder what they where thinking when they wrote disk 2, but it seems impossible to me that the same person who wrote 'Blind Faith' also wrote 'Overture'. <br /> <br />I would recommend anyone to buy this album, but don't get you're hopes up for disc 2.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Forget all that you've heard about this movie as the \\"gay cowboy\\" film...if you have a problem with that (in which case, there are other issues at play with you that I won't go into), never fear.  The only strikingly \\"gay\\" scenes in the movie are done with early on and they are done with sensitivity and grace. <br /> <br />Rather, you should think of this film as a simple, if heartbreaking story, of unrealized love.  Featuring absolutely stunning cinematic scenery and incredibly subtle performances by the cast, this is a love story for the ages.  Among the best movies of the last decade - it is impossible to watch this movie and not be moved by the sheer grief and passion simmering beneath the two rough-hewed main characters.

B00005JO20|3.0|I really didn't expect to enjoy this movie at all.  I never really thought the first movie was that interesting except as an interesting special effects flick, which though showing effects way ahead of its time, still didn't really have a story I cared much about.  Seeing the commercials for this and how the dinosaurs all looked like animated bits of gravy lumps, knowing that it was over three hours long on a story I didn't care about, and so on, I figured it really wasn't worth the time.<br /><br />Actually, I found its excessiveness and absurdities to be its best parts.  Absolutely nothing in this movie really stands under the weight of, \\"Why?\\", but it is drastically refreshing to see a director just let go and do whatever he wants, as much as he wants, as long as he wants.  This movie ended up being well worth the time... even when the scenes seemed like they'd never end.<br /><br />The problem is, I could nitpick it forever.  Nobody likes a nitpicker, so I won't, and since it's absurd anyway, nitpicking it won't serve any purpose but to aggravate the playlength.  Instead, I spent my time enjoying what I could, among them<br /><br />1) Now Kong and Ann actually have a relationship that makes the closing line have any meaning.<br /><br />2) Kong's animated expressiveness matches that of Gollum's, but Kong has the added difficulty of being unable to speak.<br /><br />3) Jack Black is funny.  Okay, so he wasn't meant to be, but still he came off as funny.  I enjoyed it at least.<br /><br />4) Adrien Brody is a great actor and I was amazed at how much emotion he put into a role that I'm pretty sure nobody even remotely connected to this movie cared that much about.<br /><br />The things that couldn't be ignored was stuff like that side story involving the child hand on the ship (soooooo useless...) and the orcs... 'scuse me, natives... attacking in very long and boring slow motion.<br /><br />Overall I'm glad I actually ended up seeing it.  I can't really see myself seeing it much more often, but for one viewing it entertains for a good long time, keeping up the pace the entire time.<br /><br />A note on this DVD edition: I don't know if it's the transfer or not, but the sound on this thing is TERRIBLE.  Whenever the sound effects sound like they're supposed to get loud, everything deadens.  I've tried it on two different speaker systems and eventually with headphones and finally settled with the headphones because I could still hear what was going on on those scenes.<br /><br />--PolarisDiBor a good long time, keeping up the pace the entire time.

0385336691|4.0|As much as I love reading Lee Child's Jack Reacher books - and I do - they bug me in equal measure. For a guy who's supposed to be a brilliant ex-Military Police officer, more often than not Reacher just comes across as a big lunkhead with a knack for finding himself in one dangerous situation after another, where he'll lumber around, waiting for the bad guys to get bored and start taking pot-shots at him.<br /><br />Frankly, I think relying on the Clint Eastwood, Drifter-With-No-Name story device is a weak way to structure a series. How long can I retain my suspension of disbelief? I dunno. I have for ten books now, but it's becoming a stretch. Unlike other thrillers where the lead character has a built-in profession that continually and realistically puts them in danger (i.e. a private eye or a cop or a lawyer or whatever), Reacher just wanders around the country, buying new clothes once a week and showering when he thinks about it. I can buy the fact that there might be folks who wander around off the grid like this. In fact, I believe they used to be called bums. And as for the women-throwing-themselves at Reacher thing... Have you ever taken a cross-country bus trip? Do you remember what you looked/smelled/felt like after? Even if you're Brad Pitt, I don't think you're gonna be getting a lot of babes...<br /><br />Anyway. All disbelief planted firmly aside...<br /><br />With the tenth Jack Reacher thriller, author Lee Child has taken his version of the drifter-with-no-name to a new level. This installment finds Reacher back in (or not having left) New York city, sitting at a busy corner coffee shop, sipping an espresso, when he notices a man walk to a car, get in, and drive off. Just another day in the city, right? Reacher thinks so too, until the next night, when he returns to his new-favorite coffee shop, and discovers that the man he saw the evening before may have been involved in a kidnapping...<br /><br />In The Hard Way, Child veers his plot back to a straight-ahead thriller, instead of a quasi-police procedural, a-la the last few Reacher books. The writing is tight as usual and the set up is kept simple and relatively believable. Here, with the aid of a beautiful ex-Federal agent, Reacher actually uses his skills to find the kidnapper and his victims, instead of waiting for the guns to start blazing. Once they do though, Reacher again takes bloody matters into his own capable hands...f a quasi-police procedural, a-la the last few Reacher books.

0743454537|4.0|ethics, morality, humanity are several topics brought up in this lovely written book.. <br />2 years ago i had to write an essay on what i thought about stem cell research, clonning and all sorts of stuff associated with it in college and reading this book certainly made me think twice on what i previously thought... <br />this book shows the emotional side of the topic and explore the simplest yet darkest side of humanity regarding saving a child... <br />while trying to save one child, sara abandoned two others and the results were very devastating with one child abusing drugs and alcohol and the other trying to sue the parents at the same time finding her own path like any normal teenagers.. <br />the downside of this book is that sara is not properly told in my opinion... sara to me is not explored deep enough for me to have any sympathy for her.. sure she has a very sick child but that's all that she can think of.. she abandoned her two other children and husband and every single excuse is about kate.. to me she doesn;t justify enough of her actions and i think picoult should have explain it deeper so in the end you really,really can;t choose  a side, anna or sara <br /> <br />jesse, the brother is pretty messed up and it's just hard to read..picoult did a brilliant job creating this character as i felt so much sympathy in him throughout the novel eventhough he's all doped up..you can;t blame him for being that as he's also been through a lot
B00005JOSS|3.0|There is an interesting relationship at the heart of \\"The Lake House\\", with a good performance from Sandra Bullock, but ultimately the film cheats, unravels and lets the audience down.<br /><br />Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock), a new doctor, leaves the Lake House, where she lived during part of medical school. Now that she is starting her residency in Chicago, she needs to live closer to the hospital. She leaves a letter for the new tenant requesting they forward her mail. Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves), a condominium developer, moves into the Lake House and reads Kate's letter. But he finds that she has referred to things that aren't there. Confused, he writes her back. After a bad day at the hospital, Kate drives out to the Lake House and checks the mailbox, finding the letter from Alex. She responds and puts another letter in the mailbox. Alex sees the flag on the mailbox raise and reaches in to find Kate's letter. They soon realize something strange is happening and ask each other the date. Alex is in 2004 and Kate is in 2006. They begin a correspondence and eventually agree to meet at a trendy restaurant in 2006. At the same time, Kate has to deal with a former boyfriend who left her after he saw her kissing a guy at a party. And Alex has to deal with his office assistant, a young woman who longs to be Mrs. Wyler, or at least Mrs. Right Now. Will they ever meet in person? Can this relationship be possible?<br /><br />Surprisingly, given the outlandish nature of the story, \\"The Lake House\\", directed by Alejandro Agresti, written by David Auburn (the Pulitzer prize winning play \\"Proof\\", which later became a film starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins) and based on a Korean film, manages to make the relationship between Alex and Kate believable, to an extent. This is remarkable because they are almost never in the same frame of film or even the same time period. Their relationship consists of many conversations, through letters. After a while, the director and writer put them in the same locations, but for different reasons and two years apart. For instance, when Alex is visiting his father (Christopher Plummer) in the hospital, he writes a letter to Kate, who is taking a break in the same hospital cafeteria as she responds. It gives them the illusion of being in the same scene together, even though, of course, they aren't.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock is very good as Kate. She manages to convey the loneliness and fatigue the young doctor experiences as she begins her residency and deals with the problems of such a job. Then, when she first begins corresponding with Alex, her amusement at the idea of such a relationship is clear. She can't quite believe it, but she continues. But as she begins to reveal more to him, and vice versa, we understand why she would become involved. All of these elements add up and make her character believable. When she confides in her supervisor (Shohreh Aghdashloo, \\"House of Sand and Fog\\", \\"American Dreamz\\", TV's \\"24\\"), we get the sense she has also had some sort of unconventional relationship, that she understands, she has sympathy. As Kate works through the various difficulties of such a relationship, her actions are believable because she is lonely, busy and unable to make a real connection with someone else.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves is good, but this is not the type of film he should be making. Reeves is better in science fiction and action films which require him to say little and emote even less. Neo in \\"The Matrix\\" trilogy is the perfect role for him. When I first heard about this film, the trailers made a point of mentioning that writer David Auburn was a Pulitzer Prize winner. When I heard this, I immediately thought `playwright' and after doing some research, I confirmed this. Often when a playwright writes a film, their dialogue still retains the feel of a play. They are two very different mediums and require different things. In a play, you need to be succinct, to capture the essence quickly. In a film, the dialogue and story need to seem more natural, allowing a little more time. I was happy to see that much of \\"House\\" doesn't have this problem. Reeves delivery doesn't lend itself well to this type of writing. At one point, as Alex is showing his brother the Lake House, he says \\"It's beautiful. Seductive even.\\" Who speaks like this? On the few occasions when the writer does veer into theatrical stage territory, the actors are able to handle it and incorporate their lines into normal speech patterns. Everyone except for Reeves. When he says this line, it sounds like a teenager practicing his role in the school's production of \\"Our Town\\".<br /><br />As the film progresses, the writer and director come up with interesting ways to get Bullock and Reeves in the same scenes, in the same timeframe, but this ultimately points to a large hole in the plot. Of course, since we are talking about a story involving time travel, maybe holes in the plot are required. That said, Alex and Kate do meet a couple of times between 2004 and 2006, yet later in the film Kate doesn't seem to know who Alex is. This might be understandable if they were casual encounters, but they share a significant conversation, meet on another occasion, and more. Later, when a significant event happens, she doesn't seem to realize it was Alex. It doesn't make sense.<br /><br />At one point, Alex creates a walking tour of Chicago's architecture for Kate. This is a nice scene, giving them a sort of virtual date. It also shows off the charms of the city. He marks sights on a map and follows along with her, showing off the best buildings in Chicago, the buildings which caused his interest in a career in architecture.<br /><br />In the end, the film uses a cop out, which I can't really discuss as it would reveal the ending. Basically, the film betrays its own story and takes a complete turn in the wrong direction.<br /><br />Okay, I'll admit it. I cry when a Hallmark commercial plays on television. Yet, somehow, I wasn't moved by the relationship between the two leads. I was interested in their correspondence, but I never felt for them as a couple. Bullock was good and I believed she was Kate, but she is only half of the equation. Part of the problem is that they spend most of the film conversing from afar, sharing little screen time together. It makes it difficult to see them as a couple. I guess I didn't understand why Reeves would go to such great lengths to find Kate. He has women throwing themselves at him, yet he wants to carry on a written correspondence for over two years? His assistant is practically ready to jump on top of him, yet he wants to hold out for a woman he has only met a few times? I understand why Kate would be willing to pursue this relationship; as mentioned, she is lonely and extremely busy. But Alex doesn't seem to have the same problem. When they finally do get together, this should trigger waterworks and I didn't even have a moist eye.<br /><br />For these reasons, what starts out as a promising romantic drama falls apart.ence quickly. In a film, the dialogue and story need to seem more natural, allowing a little more time. I was happy to see that much of \\"House\\" doesn't have this problem. Reeves delivery doesn't lend itself well to this type of writing. At one point, as Alex is showing his brother the Lake House, he says \\"It's beautiful. Seductive even.\\" Who speaks like this? On the few occasions when the writer does veer into theatrical stage territory, the actors are able to handle it and incorporate their lines into normal speech patterns. Everyone except for Reeves. When he says this line, it sounds like a teenager practicing his role in the school's production of \\"Our Town\\". <br /> <br />As the film progresses, the writer and director come up with interesting ways to get Bullock and Reeves in the same scenes, in the same timeframe, but this ultimately points to a large hole in the plot. Of course, since we are talking about a story involving time travel, maybe holes in the plot are required. That said, Alex and Kate do meet a couple of times between 2004 and 2006, yet later in the film Kate doesn't seem to know who Alex is. This might be understandable if they were casual encounters, but they share a significant conversation, meet on another occasion, and more. Later, when a significant event happens, she doesn't seem to realize it was Alex. It doesn't make sense. <br /> <br />At one point, Alex creates a walking tour of Chicago's architecture for Kate. This is a nice scene, giving them a sort of virtual date. It also shows off the charms of the city. He marks sights on a map and follows along with her, showing off the best buildings in Chicago, the buildings which caused his interest in a career in architecture. <br /> <br />In the end, the film uses a cop out, which I can't really discuss as it would reveal the ending. Basically, the film betrays its own story and takes a complete turn in the wrong direction. <br /> <br />Okay, I'll admit it. I cry when a Hallmark commercialplays on television.

B000F3AAUW|5.0|Have to admit that soul/funk/R&B are not the genres I normally listen too, but after hearing all of the buzz over this CD I decided to check it out. <br /> <br />The quality on all of these songs is excellent, starting with Cee-Lo's rich voice, the quirky and provocative lyrics, and the tight production values.   <br /> <br />This is a CD of somewhat serious, somewhat playful songs...and none disappoint.  They all have great hooks and are very memorable.  The first two, I believe, are the standout songs and I had to play them again after the CD ended.
1577656865|5.0|I love this story! It is full of suspense,depressing moments and scary moments! The ending was very deeply sad! The only think I would change would be the killing too much of it,though it was still cool like that. Well I think this is a great sotry from ages 7-12 please read this story great story for the kids!
B00005RYL9|3.0|And that ONE is the original Highlander film. The original film deals with human beings who through some twist of fate are born immortal and must fight to the death with other \\"Immortals\\" to gain the knowledge and wisdom of the Ages and more importantly mortality - a regular human existence, hence the phrase: \\"there can be only one,\\" which eventually Conan MacLeod becomes. Overall an interesting premise and the tragedy of it all inability to grow old with someone you love. Always having to pretend to age and then watching everyone around you die while you continue living. Immortality doesn't sound so fun does it? <br /> <br />2) the sequel - (the quickening) It is now 1999, earth is decimated from ozone depletion and an aged Conan MacLeod is no longer the last of his kind when two fellow breathren are dispatched from the planet Zeist to kill him. Zeist??? Zeist??? Where did that come from? Yes all of a sudden Immortals come from a distant galaxy far far away, oh sorry that's another movie. Conan fortunately kills these two bad Immortals and all of a sudden he's young and Immortal again! <br /> <br />Wait a minute remember I told you in the first film, Conan became a regular joe after killing Kurgan, the second to last of his kind. You see the dilemma, after all, the inhabitants of Zeist still existed or else they couldn't have sent anyone to kill Conan. OOPS, it seems Conan is not the last of his kind after all! But then how could he have become mortal after killing the last of his kind and then suddenly became immortal again? After he kills the Zeist Assasins? Zeist was teaming with life and Immortals so what's going on here? In the theatre when I first saw this sequel, I just kept saying to myself \\"OH MY GOD.\\" Later in a Director's cut they explain that the Immortals are not from a planet, but exist somehow outside of time...yea that clears everything up. <br /> <br />3) Third Sequel, okay, here we go again. This was the Highlander movie sequel with Mario Van Peebles that just totally dismissed the second film as if it had never been made. But there's still a problem because in the 3rd film Conan (Lambert), even though during all this time, he has killed every other immortal and has won the prize and is now mortal, Mario (an evil Immortal) along with two other evil Immortals have been frozen in ice.  <br /> <br />So how could Conan have become mortal by killing the last of his kind with these three Immortal Popcycles still technically in existence? I mean just because they're frozen, in suspended animation, does that mean they don't count in the grand scheme of things in the Universe? <br />  <br />As far as that other sequel with that wannabe Immortal (Adrian Paul)from the TV series. Don't get me started on the stupidity of that movie!  <br /> <br />As far as this edition, the quality of the film is okay, it doesn't appear to have been re-digitized, etcetera. It does come in a nice metal sleeved package, great Queen CD, but no real extras to speak of. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, whichever version of Highlander you buy, stay with the original film, pretend the sequels and series don't exist! \\"There can be only one!\\" <br />
0743243315|4.0|This book was captivating. Ali lets the reader into the mind main character, Nazneen, and all the new experiences she must encounter and to which she must react (or not react). Ali provides poignant examples of the variety of reactions from which someone in Nazneen's position might choose, and she portrays the English-Bangladeshi culture at once critically and lovingly - vividly, to say the least. Intermingled are letters from Nazneen's sister, Hasina, who remains in Dhaka. These are some of the most insightful passages in the novel. The life Hasina leads is full of pain and joy, trials and pleasure, and the life of a lone woman in a Bengali city is portrayed with tenderness, vividness, and honesty.  <br /> <br />Ali is not afraid to bump into many issues, of gender, justice, theology, philosophy, and individuality. It is a quick enough read, but still a well-written novel - a hard coupling to come by.  <br /> <br />One of my favourite things about the book were the descriptions of Bengal. Having personally reached out over rice paddy, having felt the sun and community in the Bengali village, having breathed the humid and dusty - perfect air, and hidden beneath the palm trees and among the water buffalo, I deeply appreciated stepping into Nazneen's rich memories of home.
B000056N8X|1.0|Endgame makes no sense whatsoever. If I could give it zero stars I would or better still negative stars.  This makes no sense.  Morons that claim this is a fitting sequel to the original forget that Connor wins the prize at the end of the first film so how can he, aged as he is, be facing Duncan?  Who won the prize?  Check for Christopher Lloyd and a DeLorean in the background somewhere, maybe this is a totally different timeline. That's the ONLY way this move could exist. Thank God, no more have been made.  Adrian Paul is really just a milktoast version of the Highlander.
014100018X|4.0|At the very least, that is what the priest thinks of the new businesswoman. The lady and her daughter have moved in to his small town to corrupt his parishioners with the lure of all types, shapes, sizes, and smells of chocolates. Evil has to be stopped. So, the priest marches willfully on a campaign to fight the devil in disguise. The story is written beautifully in a sing-song style of English with a tinge of French here and there. Vianne, the so-called witch, is skilful in the kitchen. Baking, cooking, and chocolate-making become an art especially when they are expressed brilliantly by the author. Vianne is also an adept entrepreneur. She befriends the townsfolk and turns the place upside-down. The only thing that is bothersome in the narration is that it always seems that Vianne knows stuff as if she can read minds and her surroundings too well for her own good. Her intuitions appear to be actively accurate. It is her story after all but after a few similar scenes it gets to be tiring. But, the entrancing style of storytelling comes to the rescue. The book is worth reading for the captivating delivery of a tale full of various types of characters and a lot of hope. It is quite different from the movie although the basic storyline is akin.
B000AUDHW8|5.0|Don't wait for the U.S. release, buy this one NOW, while you can.  I am as close to an over the top fan as you can get, since I was 16, 35 years a fan and counting!!  I truly adore this woman.  I won't take up space telling you the plot, I will say that she is top of the list, cream of the crop, none better than her.  Buy this, don't wait, we have been holding our breath for over 20 years for this...The wait is finally over, that is till the US version, with Barbra commentary, and our region, this one plays on your computer, so the large widescreen version will be a joy to behold on my home theatre system with the US release, and all those fans around the world will have the biggest Streisand Party EVER..
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I attended four of the performances at Earls Court. Having flown from South Africa to London, I was hardly going to attend just once.<br /><br />The opening night's show was actually cancelled/postponed after a section of the stadium seating collapsed and sent a few fans to hospital (they were lucky enough to be visited in hospital by some of the band the next day.) The cancelled show was re-held a few days later. Of the four shows that I saw, each one had minor variations in the set list.<br /><br />Two of the four featured the full Dark Side of the Moon<br />performances. The shows were spectacular and the band right \\"on\\" each night. It's been a long wait for this classic show to make it out on DVD and the wait is finally nearly over!<br /><br />Those of us who \\"met\\" on the 'net over the weeks prior to the show and congregated at the White Horse (pub near Parson's Green tube stop) please try and contact me via email: white-horse-inn at KuyperHoffman dot com<br /><br />UPDATE post release:<br />I have not actually yet had a chance to watch this (maybe this evening?) but first note is that it has been distributed as a Region-Free (Region 0) set! This is wonderful news and brings hope for those who fear one day moving to a different country and face replacing their entire collection of DVDs (or \\"breaking the law\\" by copying their discs with a region-breaking app or hacking their DVD players.) Political BS, this region encoding.<br /><br />I am really looking forward to watching this and reaching my own conclusions regarding the A/V quality.<br /><br />Finally, also to chip in on the 4:3 vs 16:9 aspect ratio - as much of a widescreen fan as I am, I would also hate to see the video refactored by the studio - if you want to watch it in widescreen, simply use the zoom feature (never use \\"stretch\\") on your TV/projector - it will just as easily throw away the top and bottom of the screen as the producers would have.<br /><br />[RANT ON]Stretch is dreadful as it warps the image, making objects at the edges appear fat and distorted.

B000B8QEZG|3.0|Madonna has finally created her Gay Camp Dance Classic.  Now where does that leave the rest of us who don't [won't] navigate to such broadminded self-indulgence? Well, it's still a groovy, satisfying - albeit schlocky and derivative - frothy good time.  Yes, you'll argue, she's made, at the very least, one great dance album already [Erotica] and rarely has she [or will she] come close to that astounding F-U spunk.  And, you'll ponder why she forgoes the bass half way for a more-power-to-the-synth, with prod Stuart Price in search of a groove for the too recognizable melodies borrowed from too many a dance classic.  Oh, sure, you'll scoff at the audacity of her proclivity at a Donna Summer hierarchy, without Summer's eternal vox.  Furthermore, don't believe the claque - this is not so much a return to her disco roots as it is an homage to her club-land audience.  Her catalog is permeated with memorable melodies that you are still purring years later.  Here, too often they meander and coagulate, unaware that the track toggled over to the next wannabe anthem.<br /><br />But the joviality she displays is the ecstasy she conveys.  For the first time in a long time, Madonna seems enthralled, exuberant, less mechanical that is her norm.  No longer thriving approval of the masses, she averages 1.5 mil per release, confirming at the very least her disciples will get into [and stay] the groove `til the end.  Nearing half a century, and half that as icon for the ages, she's here for the pure aesthetic.  My grade:  B
B000HBK3MM|4.0|As we entered this new decade, one genre that has seemed to disappear from the musical landscape has been R&B. Don't talk to me about Usher or Ciara because that type of R&B has been taken over Hip-Hop influences. Yeah, it was novel when Mary J. Blige invented the sub-genre over ten years ago, but now that every R&B artist has Hip-Hop producers all over their albums, it's become tiresome. Even Alicia Keys, whose first two albums were great, sometimes lets Hip-Hop take over too much in her songs. When I talk about real R&B music, I'm talking about baby making music like Boyz II Men and Babyface. <br /> <br />Enter Corinne Bailey Rae and her self titled debut album. The English songbird has actually been able make an R&B record in 2006 that doesn't have any Hip-Hop beats on it. Rae has been touted as a cross between Macy Gray and India.Arie but her voice is much more assessable than Gray's (though it does take a little time to get used to) and goes far beyond Arie's acoustic soul leanings. The comparison must come from the acoustic guitar driven second single Put Your Records On. <br /> <br />In fact on the album Rae is able to catch the vibe of R&B throughout the decade starting with the opener, Like a Star, a soft and stripped down song that evoke Billie Holiday. She then moves into the sixties with Trouble Sleeping which could have fit in easily at a time when Motown ruled. Then Call Me When You Get This with its pseudo-disco beat could have been played during the hey day of Studio 54. Breathless would have a good edition to any Anita Baker album. With the closing track, Seasons Change, Rae is even able to evoke Alicia Keys without the Hip-Hop beats. <br /> <br />This album may not be enough to bring back real R&B nor will it produced more babies than a Barry White release, but it's definitely worth a listen to anyone who misses silky voices and are tired of aggravated drum beats. The diversity of the album, mixing a wide range of soul music as well as a wide variety of instruments from song to song, should keep Corinne Bailey Rae in music collections for years to come.
0440213525|3.0|the story was exciting, a page turner, makes me want to find out what will happen next and how it was gonna end. easy to read, not complicated or complex language in other words easy to understand.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This was broadcast live many years ago. It was broadcast live on (ON TV) one of the first pay subscription services broadcast over A UHF band. The conert footage was awesome! Im sure this DVD will have additional footage since the original broadcast was limited to 2 hours.I hope the time spent on re-mastering the original tapes will be worth the long wait. So if you read reviews that people state they already have this, they are wrong. They may have a bootleg version which was put out many years ago. This will certainly be worth getting.
B00005JNEI|4.0|This film comes from a very biased viewpoint and should be taken as such.  This is no different than listening to Bill O'Reilly or Rush Limbaugh.  Moore tries to present his viewpoint in a humerous entertaining way and that is hit or miss.  I don't like his stunts such as getting Congresspeople to enlist their children.  I think that detracts from his narrative and it isn't that entertaining.  What I think most people should look at is that it is not 'liberal' to question the government's motives.  I lived through the 60's where civil rights participants were followed and bugged for years.  These people were in peaceful groups and did not use violence.  What a waste of resources, especially when the FBI and CIA could have been following the violent racist groups dedicated to making the white race supreme.  Now the government sees antiwar protesters as enemies of the state.  This deserves attention.  Also the Bush administration ties to Saudi business interests should be closely investigated.  We have lost billions due to the protection of Haliburton.  That money is not going to rebuilding Iraq nor protecting our troops.  Can you get any more unpatriotic than that?  Anyway Moore's points are valid, even if he goes overboard on the issues.  His facts are not always correct which detracts from his message.  He should tighten up his narrative so that people who don't agree with him would at least try to delve into the criticisms.  My professor told us to read newspapers/magazines from all points of views. You can't be a critical thinker without seeing opposing views.  No matter where you stand, this movie is worth viewing.

0385486804|4.0|This book haunted me for months after finishing it.  Never being someone to enjoy time alone for too long, from the start I was intrigued as to why Christopher McCandless, the main character of the book, chose to give up his undeniably affluent and social lifestyle to live for months in stranded bus with a limited supply of food and no connection to civilization in a deserted Alaskan landscape.      Pulled from the headlines of newspapers nationwide, John Krakauer, took McCandless story to heart and started to investigate this exact question.  He interviewed many people McCandless met throughout his journey across the country, looked into into McCandless background and investigated the circumstances of his death.  The result is a fast-paced and interesting book that keeps the reader engaged to the end.  Interweaving tales of his own life and experiences, Krakauer paints the picture of a well-adjusted young man, who like so many other young people despised the idea of living up to others expectations and instead searched to find a more meaningful and different life.  The path he chose may not have been the best to find what he was looking and ultimately led to his demise, but it is certainly a quest that many readers may be able to relate to.      Krakauer is a journalist at heart, having worked many years for Outside magazine and other publications.  His investigation may not lead to all the answers, but it is thorough and well written.  This book is a quick and engaging read that does not have an enjoyable end, but one that will keep you fascinated and question your own outlook on life and what it has to offer.
0671004107|5.0|Contact <br />Carl Sagan <br /> <br />Congratulations, <br /> <br />You are about to embark on a journey through time and space, and get the opportunity to observe and evaluate the very thoughts of the author and ppreciate the author's scientific intuition. You will assimilate the moral, ethical, and philosophical issues that arise from the discovery of the \\"Message\\" and the building of the \\"Machine.\\" Most importantly, you will discover that a relationship exists between scientific and philosophical disciplines, and enjoy some good old fashion story telling mixed in just for fun. <br /> <br />PRELIMINARY <br /> <br />To understand the book is to understand the man. Our distinguished author has many credits to his name. He was the Director of the Laboratory for Planetary Studies and David Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences at Cornell University. He was part of the team responsible for the Viking, Mariner, and Voyager Expeditions. He received NASA medals for Exceptional Scientific Achievement and for Distinguished Public Service. He was past chairman of the Division for Planetary Sciences and the Astronomy Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Four hundred of his scientific and popular articles have been published. Additionally, he was the author and co-author of several other books including : \\"Intelligent Life in the Universe,\\" \\"The Cosmic Connection,\\" \\"The Dragons of Eden,\\" \\"Murmurs of  Earth,\\" \\"Broca's Brain,\\" \\"Comet,\\" his most famous - \\"Cosmos,\\" \\"A Path Where No Man Thought,\\" an expose' of the nuclear winter scenario, and his last - \\"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors.\\" He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in literature in 1978; he was also a champion of both human and Earth rights.  But for all his brilliance, intuitiveness, and achievement, Carl Sagan recognized his own mortality and insignificance in the Universe. <br /> <br />Contact. Only Carl Sagan could devise this simple, one word name for his first fiction novel; thetitle so eloquently and completely describes the central plot of his story - contact with an advanced galactic civilization and, perhaps, more - the identity of which is: to be announced! <br /> <br />Given his credentials, it is not surprising to me that Carl Sagan chose the subject of extraterrestrial contact for his first fiction novel; it so perfectly reflects his own interests: Cosmology, SETI, and CETI activities; SETI and CETI, incidently, refer to 'Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence' and 'Contact with Extraterrestrial Intelligence' respectively. His novel names real places, among them: the Arecibo facility in Puerto Rico and the Argus Array in Socorro, New Mexico. He conducted SETI activities at both these facilities. Indeed, his first fiction novel is a reflection of his own fantasies and ambitions of locating alien intelligence. With his collaborator and colleague, Ann Druyan, he achieved excellent results with \\"Contact.\\" <br /> <br />STORY SYNOPSIS <br /> <br />In the late 1980's, an intelligent radio source (a message)is received from the vicinity of the Vega star system in the constellation of Lyra.  The signal contained many levels of information encoded by various modulation methods and astronomers found: a re-broadcast of the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, a set of prime numbers, and finally, elaborate instructions to build a machine. It's the \\"Machine.\\" Extraterrestrials are telling us they know we're here. Several years were needed to decode the instructions and build the Machine. During this time, great political, philosophical, religious, and scientific debates took place to determine the purpose, implications, and ramifications of the now controversial Machine.  The Machine is eventually determined to be a vehicle by which five Earth travelers would be able to journey to Vega and be greeted by the Message senders. The Machine, do decahedron in shape, is completed and, on New Year's Eve - 1999, it is activated with 5 selected travelers on board.  Within a matter of minutes, the travelers visit several spectacularly beautiful star systems before finally reaching their destination and  meeting the Message senders, the \\"Caretakers.\\"  <br /> <br />The travelers find that the Caretakers are a conglomeration of cultures that have been around for half a billion years. After determining that the expanding Universe will eventually spread itself too thin to allow for the formation of new stars and galaxies, the Caretakers decided they would harness and corral extraneous matter using the gravity effects of black holes and other devices, and cause a sufficient concentration of the matter to insure the continued rebirth of new stars and galaxies. At times, they \\"closed off\\"  sections of the Universe until needed. <br /> <br />Does Dr. Sagan have an imagination, or doesn't he?! The Caretakers are certainly the ultimate ecologists. Like a galactic version of Johnny Appleseed, they have taken the task of re-planting the Universe!  The Caretakers' true appearance is never revealed because they appear to each of the Earth travelers as the travelers' loved ones. Dr. Ellie Arroway, our heroine and main character, talks with her dead \\"father\\" and learns that the Caretakers have an \\"emerging civilization division\\" that makes contact with cultures such as Earth, and invites them for a visit and tour. The Caretakers have watched many civilizations come and go but believe the Earth has hope for survival. <br /> <br />Dr. Arroway's assigned host, her \\"father,\\" talks with her about the possibility of a hidden message buried deep with the value of \\"Pi,\\" perhaps 10 to the 20th power digits beyond the decimal point. Dr. Arroway ponders the idea. But visit time is almost up! The Caretakers escort the travelers back to their craft and, without proof of their visit, send them home. Ellie later investigates the properties of Pi and makes a gargantuan discovery! <br /> <br />A WORD ABOUT STORY ACCURACY <br /> <br />Above all, Carl Sagan isa scientist. Based on what I know about him from his previous works, he apparently assumes nothing and questions everything. He is a stickler for detail. He retains that child-like wonder and imagination of the world around him - and of the Universe in which we reside. Accordingly, he left little to chance while weaving his story. <br />A transmission emanates from the Vega star system. Vega is about the right age, the right size, and the right spectral range to spawn a planetary system conducive to supporting an advanced civilization. It is also 26 light years away. The transmission, received about 1988, contained an encoded re-broadcast of the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. The period between 1936 and 1988 is 52 years; a round-trip radio transmission from Earth to Vega and back would take 52 years. Dr. Sagan later weaves the speed of light limit into his story when the Earth travelers are accused of perpetrating a hoax by government officials. The travelers are informed that the Message stopped at the moment the Machine was  activated. With their limited minds, the government officials \\"know\\" that it should take 26 years for news of Machine activation to reach Vega. They refuse to believe that the Vegans could have broken the speed of light barrier. Dr. Sagan shrewdly used his \\"writer's license\\" with respect to the speed of light issue. As Isaac Asimov put it in his book The Roving Mind: \\"What do science fiction writers do?......better writers know of the speed of light limit and get around it by assuming that in the future, new technologies will be available. They talk about moving through 'hyperspace,' or through 'subspace'; they make use of a 'subetheric drive' or a 'space warp'. <br /> <br />But let's get back on track. Our distinguished author's work is more accurately described as a science and philosophy text book with a story woven in to connect these things. I estimate that 65 percent of the book would remain if the story were removed. Among the multitude ofscientific notions \\"Contact\\" explores are the descriptions of various radio transmission modulation methods and the properties of exponential growth. Through his Ellie Arroway character, Dr. Sagan points out that one cubic centimeter of water (about one thimble full) contains 3 x 10 to the 19th power molecules whereas the entire Universe contains 1 x 10 to the 80th power elementary particles. A numerical difference of only 61 (in terms of powers of ten) is the difference between a few drops of water and all the matter in the entire Universe! In addition, the reader learns about worm holes, black holes, the birth and death of stars, bright infrared and x-ray emission sources, precession of the Earth's axis, Keppler's three laws, and much more.  Speaking of Johannes Keppler, Dr. Sagan - the little devil - cleverly and surreptitiously slipped Keppler's proposed model of the solar system into his story. Dr. Sagan's Machine took the form of a do decahedron enclosed by three concentric rotating, mutually perpendicular hemispheres he calls benzels. In his paper entitled Mysterium Cosmographicum, published in 1596, Keppler borrows the Greek Mathematicians' discovery of the five - and only five - regular solids. A regular solid is one in which all sides are the same. In Keppler's model, the five solids are nestled one-in-the-other, separated by concentric spheres. One of these regular solids is a do decahedron, formed of twelve pentagons. Is the similarity between Keppler's model and Dr. Sagan's Machine a coincidence? I don't think so. Dr. Sagan is not only brilliant, he's sneaky. \\"Contact\\" may someday be used as a textbook. <br /> <br />Speaking of textbooks, consider the following riddle. What does one get when one combines the fundamental parts of the book \\"Cosmos\\" with a fictional story? Answer: \\"Contact.\\" As I previously mentioned, \\"Contact\\" IS Dr. Sagan's way of telling us his dreams. Consider the following examples: <br />Contact: p.77 - Ellie imagines the Message asthe \\"Encyclopedia Galactica\\" when it is first received. <br />Cosmos: pp.291-315 - An entire chapter is entitled \\"Encyclopedia Galactica.\\" This chapter is a speculative accounting of how another civilization might communicate with us. <br />Contact: p.100 - Ellie explains to the President that the transmission from Vega has messages over messages in different levels of modulation - what she calls a \\"palimpsest.\\"     Cosmos: p.314 - \\"But the most likely case is that interstellar communication will be a kind of palimpsest, like the palimpsests of the ancient writers short of papyrus or stone who superimposed their messages on top of preexisting messages.\\" <br />These are but a few of the many parallels that exist between \\"Contact\\"  and \\"Cosmos.\\" Is there any doubt that Dr. Sagan is telling us his greatest ambition - his greatest dream? <br /> <br />SCIENTIFIC INSIGHTS EXPLORED <br /> <br />Scientific insight is an understatement in \\"Contact.\\" Dr. Sagan wasted no time with the development of his Ellie Arroway main character and our heroine. As a champion of civil and human rights, he naturally gave us a female astronomer and a female President. He meticulously describes Ellie's hard struggle to overcome harsh prejudices and resistance to her achieving her goal of becoming a radio astronomer and scientist in this male dominated profession. He also took great care to give her a perpetually inquisitive mind that questioned everything. She is a master of \\"Why?\\" From child through adulthood, she wondered about everything from the way vacuum tubes worked to - the Bible's compatibility with science to - the physical makeup of the Universe. Her curiosity parallels Albert Einstein's comment that a passion for comprehension is a necessary component of the scientific mind. <br /> <br />Dr. Sagan's Ellie character also follows in the best traditions  <br />of women devoted to space exploration: Henrietta Leavitt, the Harvard astronomer who devised a stellar distance measuring method in 1912; Jocelyn Bell, the Cambridge astronomer who discovered what we now call \\"pulsars\\" in 1967; Linda Morabito, the JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) engineer who discovered active volcanos on Jupiter's moon, Io in 1988; and, most poignantly, astronauts Judy Resnik and Christa McAullife who gave their lives in the pursuit of space exploration. <br /> <br />Through his various characters and situations, Dr. Sagan also poses the questions of technical civilizations being self limiting through self destruction; the probable numbers of other cultures in the Universe based on favorable conditions; are we too dumb for other civilizations to bother with; are we really fundamentally happier with the benefits of science - each of these concerns shared by Isaac Asimov, among others.  A religious leader in the book offers these criticisms of scientists:  scientists keep findings to themselves; only share information in bits and pieces; over-estimate what they know, under-estimate what people know; taught us how to annihilate ourselves. This same religious leader attempts to identify God as the source of the Message. He incredibly points out that Vega was the \\"North Star\\" about ten thousand B.C. when the Earth's axis was at the other side of its precession cycle (precession is a wobble in the Earth's rotation axis). This era marks the emergence of civilization and the concept of gods. It is Divine Providence that the guiding star then is the origin of this message now, he claims. Does Dr. Sagan dig into the depths of detail, or doesn't he? <br /> <br />Dr. Sagan, again through his Ellie character, does not allow the Bible to escape scrutiny. Ellie, in conference with not one but two prominent religious leaders, chairs a great marathon debate that scrutinizes biblical accuracy. Pro Bible arguments from the religious leaders focus mainly on claims of fulfilled Bible prophesies:  \\"The coming of the savior is foretold in Isaiah fifty-three, in Zechariah fourteen, in First Chronicles seventeen. That He would be born in Bethlehem was prophesied in Micah five. That He would come from the line of David was foretold in Matthew one.....the Ministry and Suffering of Jesus are foretold in Isaiah fifty-two and fifty-three, and the Twenty-second Psalm. That He would be betrayed for thirty pieces of silver is explicit in Zechariah eleven....and the Bible speaks of our own time. Israel and the Arabs, Gog and Magog, America and Russia, nuclear war - it's all there in the Bible.\\" Undaunted, Ellie waits for the right moment to return fire. Among her first salvo of rebuttals: The prophecies are often abstract and vague, ambiguous and imprecise - open to a wide range of interpretations.....even straightforward prophecies don't seem to jibe - like Jesus' promise that the Kingdom of God would come within the lifetime of some people in his audience.....passages that seem fulfilled are highlighted and the rest are ignored. <br /> <br />She continues by asking why God's communication with us in contemporary times isn't made perfectly clear.  Why doesn't the Bible contain information that no mortal person would have known at the time - such as the Sun is a star....or Mars is a rusty place with deserts and volcanos....or a body in motion tends to remain in motion....or nothing travels faster than the speed of light? Why is there no mention of such things like \\"Two strands entwined is the secret of life\\"....or why hasn't He put a giant crucifix in orbit around Earth....or place the Ten Commandments across the face of the moon? Why no more burning bushes or pillars of fire or a thundering voice from the sky saying \\"I am that I am?\\" Why does He remain so cryptic - why doesn't He rattle our cages each generation or so?  The marathon philosophical debate ends with all participants adjourning, satisfied with their respective offerings but not swayed by the others' positions. <br /> <br />ADDITIONAL COMMENTS <br /> <br />Strikingly, \\"Contact\\" contains a table of contents not unlike that of an omnibus text book. \\"Contact\\" takes us on a tour that introduces us to the unique properties of Pi .. scientific investigation and hypothesis .. contributions of Greek science and mathematics .. our solar system .. the known properties of the Universe .. black holes .. do decahedrons .. exponential powers .. the Milky Way .. stars' life-cycles .. the Renaissance astronomers .. probability of extraterrestrial intelligence .. probability of our survival .. our insignificance .. our propensity toward greed and corruption .. our pollution problems .. our place in the Universe .. and much more. Science, religion, politics, psychology, philosophy, and their relationships to each other - it's all there - in \\"Contact.\\" <br /> <br />Dr. Sagan's message to his readers is multi-faceted. He tells us who we are, where we've been, what were doing, and where we're going. He tells us we need to make the right decisions now if we are to have a desirable future; he tells to be scientists, to have an open mind; he counsels us to control our arrogance; he demonstrates the distinct possibility of life elsewhere in the Cosmos; but most significantly, he tells us WHO HE IS. Although Dr. Sagan is no longer with us, I feel his message is still very much alive. <br /> <br />But for all his brilliance, scientific knowledge and intuitiveness, skepticism, and resourcefulness, Dr. Sagan still held the door open to the idea that there may be a . . . Hey - read the book! <br /> <br />\\"Contact\\" isn't for everybody . . . but . . . it should be. <br /> <br />SOME PERSONAL THOUGHTS <br /> <br />I first enjoyed reading this book when it was first published. I recently read it again to enhance my appreciation of it because I was able to convert my increased knowledge of the sciences from my schooling into a greater understanding of Dr. Sagan's \\"Message.\\"  <br /> <br />Dr. Sagan issued a disclaimer at the end of his book, telling the reader that no character in the book is a close portrait of a real person. I don't think this is entirely true. I can't help believe that there isn't at least a smidgeon of similarity between the persona of the Ellie Arroway character and that of Dr. Sagan or, perhaps, his colleague and collaborator, Ann Druyan. <br /> <br />Enjoy! <br />
B000000WJZ|5.0|Let me preface this review by making it clear that I am by no means musically ignorant and am usually up on most of the really good music out there. I had heard much about Smashing Pumpkins before I really ever sat down to listen to them, and there had been certain times I know I had blindly heard them on the radio and enjoyed it. But after recently being introduced to several of their best tracks, I picked up Siamese Dream and I refuse to take it out of my stereo. Billy Corgan shocked me with one of the most unique, gripping voices in modern music, and he commands every song with assurance and genuine catharsis. The musical arrangements are stunning, taking each song through several movements of dreamy, flowing grooves and heavy, complex hard rock. The lyrics stand on their own as true angst-filled poetry, pushing this band past the ranks of most other grunge/alt rockers. \\"Cherub Rock,\\" \\"Hummer,\\" \\"Soma,\\" and \\"Mayonaise\\" top the album as the best tracks, sticking themselves in your subconscious like a rat in a cage. Truly mesmerizing music and I'm ecstatic to have found it, a bit late in the game maybe.
0425152251|4.0|I finished this novel in three days, as I was so intrigued by the ideas presented. The five hundred plus pages seem infinite at first, but the philosophical theories are so excellently formed that they just fly by.  <br />Sophie's World is an excellent read for any person who is interested in philosophy, and wants to know theories wihout actually having to read Plato or Descartes. The author obviously knows his stuff, so you are thinking constantly while reading about the theories presented, and most importantly, are intrigued to know more about the snippets of each philosopher.  <br />It would be a daunting task for anyone, to write the history of philosophy in just five hundred pages. However, Jostein Gaarder rises to the challenge magnificently.  <br />Before you run to buy this book, it is important to know that this is not a novel for people who like action or \\"brain candy\\" stories. At times, the theories do become slightly dry, and you almost wish there was more of a story.  <br />This is the whole reason that I knocked off a star. I wish that Gaarder had spent as much time developing his story and characters, as much as he did his research. When I finished reading, I was satisfied that I had learned an infinite amount of philosophy in just three days, but felt cheated that I did not learn about Sophie, the magical woods, the major, etc. In a sense, the research needed to be incorporated with the story, instead of textbook form, to create an even better work.  <br />Except for that small flaw, I loved this book. Stories like these make me have faith in the literary world once more.  <br />After reading, as there are only snippets about each philosopher, it might be good to research and read more about the ones whose theories were the most interesting. Therefore, a bigger picture can be gained even more.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This movie is so perfect. It is a thriller/ romantic movie. The Phantom is inlove with a singer/performer named Kristine who is one of the protagonists in the movie, but her heart longs for someone else. Half of the Phantom's face is seriously disfigured, and he was hiding part of his face with a mask so that people can't see it. It is truly entertaining. I love the casts. The lovely Emmy Rossum (Kristine)possess such a powerful voice. I especially like her duet with Patrick Wilson (Rauol), who is not only handsome, but also a talented broadway singer. The plot of the movie is very interesting and the performance of the actors, especially Gerard Butler is extremely moving...... I'm glad they chose a handsome and sexy actor to play the Phantom (Gerard Butler). I have never seen the original Phantom of the Opera, but some people say that in the original rendition, the Phantom was an older man and an antithesis of the new Phantom. I think viewers might even be moved with the story. The actions committed by the Phantom are deplorable such as his murderous rampage, but you can't help but feel emphaty for the lonely soul.His pitiful experiences and his obsession with Kristine drove him into madness.  I love Gerard's performance and his eyes seem to show deep emotions; it is extremely convincing. Gerard Butler's delivery is amazing. His voice is also perfect for his role. He was able to show the mysteriousness and the passion of the Phantom with his acting skills and his voice. I never regret buying this movie. I love it!!!!!!!!!! You will like all the songs especially the song entitled \\"All I Ask of You.\\"
B000FFJ85I|5.0|If you expect this album to sound like STS then you haven't been listening to AFI long enough. Yes, the new material takes a little getting used to, but that has been said about every album they have made. Black sails sounded nothing like their previous work, and AOD was not what you expected to evolve from Black Sails, then came STS which sounded . . . you guessed it . . . much different. I first discovered AFI when I was a young punk and their music matched my tastes at the time, but I have grown and changed and a lot of bands I used to like just don't cut it anymore. But AFI still remains my favorite and that doesn't happen if you make the same album over and over again. <br /> <br />Yes, perhaps they are a bit more appealing to the masses now, but they have in no way sold out. They are still loyal to their fans, both old and new, and they still put everything they got into their live performances. I just saw them play two nights ago and it was one of the best performances I have ever seen from them. Davey engages with the crowd much more between songs and the mix of old (pre Black Sails) and newer stuff was amazing. Plus they made a point to come out after the show and hang out with their fans, Hunter especially who was out on the street for over an hour talking with fans. We were able to have actual conversations with them, not just two words and a scribble-ish signature. <br /> <br />They are genuine guys who love what they do and we love them for it. They easily could have made another STS but they kept true to themselves and gave us something unexpected. Open yourself up to some changes and you will grow to love this album.
0060751967|5.0|I love vampire fiction (which is one of the reasons I write it). HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE VAMPIRE is clever, funny and really well written. The scene where Roman loses his fang and has to search for an all-night dentist is HILARIOUS. Kerrelyn has built a fabulous vampire world that any lover of paranormal romance will adore.
B000EGCITG|5.0|I bought this cd just for refreshment, coz i'm sick of what I here these days. So I decided to try P!nk hoping that it would turn out good. And WHOOOLLAAAA!! This album is faboulous! I enjoyed every song in this album, laughed everytime i saw the STUPID GIRLS video, everything! Because of this album I bought the other P!nk CD's, loved Can't take me home, understood her M!zzundaztood, tried that but didn't like try this. So... Buy this cd!! U Won't regret it!
B0009UC7T8|5.0|When my daughter came over to visit, she suggested that we rent this film. Since it stars Samuel L. Jackson and is about a high school basketball coach, I thought that it sounded promising. Well, it turned to be more than just promising. It is a movie that held me riveted to the screen the entire time it was on. Samuel L. Jackson is simply outstanding in the role of a high school coach who sees basketball as the means to an end and not the end itself.<br /><br />Based upon a true story that took place in Richmond, California, it centers on a man named Ken Carter. He was asked by the retiring basketball coach of Richmond High School to return as a part-time basketball coach to the school from which Ken had graduated and left his mark many years earlier. The school is one of those schools in which people barely graduate and, of those that do, most do not go on to college. The basketball team was no great shakes either, having won only four games in the entire previous year.<br /><br />Finally, Carter is prevailed upon to take over as coach. He has, however, decided that he wants to make a difference. He starts off by letting the team know who is boss and by trying to instill discipline and respect. He wants to go back to fundamentals. He wants to put the emphasis on being a student athlete. To this end, he makes it clear just what his expectations are. He drafts a contract that those who wish to remain on the team, as well as their parent, must sign. Some of the conditions are that the players must attend class, do their schoolwork, and pass their classes. Those who signed the contract ended up making the best move of their lives.<br /><br />Coach Carter keeps his side of the bargain, turning the team into a formidable one on the court. Suddenly, basketball at Richmond High School begins commanding attention. Notwithstanding this, he still emphasizes that they are to be just as committed to their studies. While one might expect some resistance from the student athletes to such a change, one would expect support from the educators themselves. What is amazing is the resistance that he experiences from the teaching community who are reluctant to give him progress reports on how his players were doing academically.<br /><br />When Coach Carter finally gets his long awaited progress reports and discovers that some of his student athletes are not holding up their end of the contract, all hell breaks loose. Even though they have had an undefeated season so far, he basically locks the gym and tells his players that there will be no more basketball, until he sees some academic improvement. To his surprise, the school board, as well as the parents, does not support him in this matter, and the situation becomes a media sensation on the West Coast. Support comes from an unexpected source, the student athletes themselves.<br /><br />This is a heartwarming story about a coach who cared and dared to make a difference in the lives of kids that had little or no future. What he did for those students was incomparable, as he basically gave them a chance for a better life. Samuel L. Jackson is sensational as Coach Carter, dynamic and totally believable in the role. The young men who play his student athletes likewise give excellent performances. Ashanti also gives a surprisingly well nuanced performance as the girlfriend of one of the student athletes. Moreover, for those who enjoy great basketball, the on court scenes are extremely well done.<br /><br />At the end of the film, there is a summary of what happened to these young men. When the viewer sees what happened to them, the viewer cannot help be but touched by the turn of events. This is a very well acted, deftly directed, inspirational film and one that is worthy of being in one's personal collection.s to such a change, one would expect support from the educators themselves.

B000002IJL|5.0|This soundtrack is easily one of the most timeless you will ever hear.  From the Chordettes and \\"Lollipop\\" to Shirley and Lee \\"Let The Good Times Roll\\".  This music takes you back to those warm summer nights, whether you are 12 or 62.  Stand By Me is a true coming of age story, and these songs will remind you of that magical time in your life.  Don't pass this one up!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If I could give the Firefly series 10 stars, I would.  This is the best show I've ever seen - I can't believe how developed each character was considering the length of it's run and the number of important roles.  This was not given a fair chance, which is a shame, because I haven't met anyone who disliked Firefly.
B00008WT5E|5.0|Powerage is a great album. It's not AC/DC's greatest CD, but it's still great all-around rock n' roll. A great pick up for any AC/DC fan.
1592401791|5.0|This book left me wanting MORE!!I should give it only 4 stars for that, but then I would be shortchanging the book and its author. I want to just copy the title of M. Cassman's review because its exactly what I thought to write. But, I believe I can be a bit more succinct than he. So, here goes: Do you wanna read MORE about Beatlemania? Neither do I. Wanna read MORE about the trip to India? Neither do I. Wanna read MORE about the stupid bed-in/peace-in/whatever? Right! Neither do I.  Wanna read MORE about how Brian Epstein was gay and may have diddled with John? Neither do I. Wanna know MORE about how the Beatle women affected the band's direction and relationships? Right again. Neither do I. And this book skips ALL OF THAT. Thank you, Geoff Emerick. New information. A new perspective. NOT a waste of money.If you love The Beatles, you will be grateful to own/read this book. Now, if you're reading reviews of this book, you're considering buying it. So, what are you waiting for? (Oh yeah, and the review above says that Geoff was the engineer for the Beatles from 1966 on. But the truth is he worked with them and met them as far back as 1962, and that is a very significant fact to add).
B00006F83Y|5.0|I bought this album becasue I had always liked the Desert Sessions and I also liked Rated R.  BUT... I have to say, this album beats all of the new and old QOTSA albums and even ALL of the Desert Sessions.  I will tell you why. <br /> <br />1.The Real Song For the Deaf: 5/10, makes you think, maybe deaf people can actually hear this song.   <br />2. You think....: 9/10, Starts slow, but then begins the very rhthmitic guitar and haunting lyrics.  Occasional guitar fills and a rather cool sounding bass and drum.  Overall, this song gets your blood pumping for the rest of the CD. <br />3. No One Knows: 7/10,  Overrated is one way to put it.  Although the lyrics are clear and the guitars are original and powerfull, almost sounds too poppy.  Nick Oliveri is a god though. <br />4. First It Giveth:  9/10, Nice, starts out and ends strong.  The chourus is simpily AMAZING, this is truly a great QOTSA song, third best on album. <br />5. A Song For The Dead: 8/10, Cool Song, the guitar in the backround really gives it that punch that this album is known for, the chourus is good, but still lacks a little clearness, very dirty and hummy.  The presolo and solo are cool though. <br />6. The Sky Is Falling:  8/10, Starts slow and dazy and then goes into a repetitve verse with a big muff guitar pedal and clear lyrics.  Chorus is almost identical to the verse, but still sounds great.  At around the 4:22 mark, the song really shines with great guitar playing and a Desert Session sound alike deal.  Ends the way it began.  Overall, a good song. <br />7. Six Shooter: 7/10, Sounds like if the early 80's punk, (Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, etc.),  became experimental.  Overall, pretty funny and definetly inspired by someone really pissed off. <br />8. Hangin Tree: 8/10, Originally a Desert Session song I belive.  The bass in this song is great, and the overall composition of the song is genius.  The soft lyrics on top of that classic QOTSA guitar really makes this a good song, not amazing, but not bad by any means.  <br />9. Go With The Flow:  9/10, This is the song that sort of turns the album into what people think of it.  This is the BIG song right in the middle that you either love or hate.  Great lyrics that vibe into a quick paced Rhythm guitar and drum beat.  Amazing song! <br />10. Gonna Leave You: 7/10, unfortunatley, sounds like some of the other songs on the cd.  Still overall a good song, but just starts to get repetitive.  <br />11. Do it again: 8/10, Has sounds from the other tracks but this song sort of stands out above the others becasue of the \\"du du du du. HEY!\\"  Pretty cool, the chorus is good too.   <br />12. God is in the Radio: 8/10, CLASSIC QOTSA!  Scary somewhat but still has great rhythm and original lyrics.  I think I would hear this song on a train ride to hell.  Dark and mysterious is some ways, but very well put toghether. <br />13. Another Love Song: 8/10, Starts out with a 50's sort of guitar over a simple drum beat.  Josh is not singing, but whoever is, is doing a decent job.  The choir like backround voices are really cool, makes this song sound like angels singing in hell. <br />14. A Song For The Deaf: 9/10 Starts out with a scary guy saying, \\" A song for the deaf, that is for you.\\"  AWESOME!!! The bass starts out on the song, then the guitars and drumming picks up.  The little solos throught the song are cool and low key, no Kirk Hammet solos here.  There are also wierd sound effects throught the song that make it seem scarrier than it is.  The bass stop near the 2:40 is cool, sounds like Desert Sessions once again.  Ends like it began with screaming in the backround, but then something else.  The end of the radio broadcast, but not the end of the cd.  This song is number 2 on the cd. P.S. at about the 5:50 mark on the song theres this witch chant that is wierd, damn musicians and thier wierd ways. <br />15. Mosquito Song: 10/10, Possibly my favorite song of all time.  They use a 12 acoustic guitar that shines abovethe lyrics, but if you listen closely, they are talking about a guy being chased through the forest and then eaten whole, YEAH! Slayer like lyrics inside an acoustic song.  The piano part just builds up the end like no other.  Then the guitar comes back with a full orchestra!  Then they do the best solo on the cd on an acoustic!  There are also hints of their new album in this song too if you can catch them. <br /> <br />Overall, this CD ranks very high with my favorites, and I would recomend this to anyone who likes rock or metal, period
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Mark and Emmylou; a match made in heaven. The guitar of Dire Straits and the voice of Emmylou Harris. In the vacuous musical environment of today this is a breath of fresh air. Listen and enjoy music doesn't get better than this very often anymore.
0156907399|4.0|Virginia Woolf was a true literary genius, with a gift for capturing the emotional lives of her characters that isn't often seen in modern writing.  That said, To the Lighthouse is one of her more difficult works; it follows the character's internal lives in a very Joyce-ian way, and like all true stream of consciousness writing, can be hard to fully comprehend.  But the depth of feeling she manages to encapsulate with her deft turn of phrase is remarkable, and well worth reading.  I don't recommend this novel for those who have never read Woolf before.  Start with Mrs. Dalloway, and when you read To the Lighthouse later, you'll appreciate it more.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|Some folks will never be happy. Lucas finally gives you what you want and all you can do is nit pick and groan and moan about it. This is it folks, either put up or shut up. You were crazy if you think Lucas was going to completely remaster a version of the film that he himself despises. Want anamorphic you have the 2004 cut. If not you can never again complain about Greedo shooting first. Lucas has given you what you wanted.
B000002H2H|5.0|It was their \\"Black Album\\" that really got me into metallica, so I started with that one and worked my way back, which means that I heard \\"Master of Puppets\\" before listening to this one in its entirety. <br /> <br />In my opinion, \\"Ride the Lightning\\" ties with \\"metallica\\" is being their best work. My favorite song on this album is \\"The call of Ktulu\\" (yes, I think this one's better than \\"Orion\\" ). <br /> <br />This album, overall is extremely heavy and fast paced, with great melodic interludes (\\"Fade to Black\\"). Fight Fire with Fire and the title track pack a huge punch, followed by the classic \\"for whom the bell tolls\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Creeping Death\\" is another favorite, the evergreen anthem that gives fans at concerts the opportunity to raise their fists and chant \\"die ! die! die !\\"  <br /> <br />Another thing that blew me away was the sound (the production). Whoever has been twiddling those knobs in the studio has done an amazing job; the whole album sounds like a really high production quality live album. The sound has great depth, with the drums and bass matched perfectly with the rythm. I think this is worth mentioning because this is grossly lacking on their \\"...and justice for album\\", which sounds outright flat. <br /> <br />This is one of those rare albums that has NO fillers. Every song here is great. If you're just getting into metallica, get the \\"Black Album\\" first, and then this one. <br /> <br />
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|Had Wolfmother released their first LP anywhere from thirty-five to twenty years earlier, they'd have been dismissed as nothing more than a Sabbath rip-off or some Eighties version of Candlebox.  But Wolfmother finds itself stranded in a time where most mainstream rockers painfully and ineffectively rip-off Nirvana's riffs, Pearl Jam's song structure, Galvin Rossdale's singing and Weezer's poppy-ness; not too many modern artists directly copy the styles of  Zeppelin, Sabbath or Van Halen anymore.  Do the Stainds, Slipknots and Mudvanes of the world still have traces off early Sabbath in their riffs? Do the likes of Blink, JEW and Yellowcard still try to achieve the speedy song styles of the Sex Pistols and Ramones?  Sure, but only by default...you see, these bands mimic the late-Eighties/early-Nineties alternative, all of whom derived from classic rock origins.  For example, Soundgargen copies Sabbath's fashion, and then Papa Roach comes back and copies Soundgarden's style...see the connection?  And now we have Wolfmother who bypasses (if you will) the middleman/filler (if you will--wow, I can't believe I just called Soundgarden \\"filler\\"!) of the Grunge scene and just goes straight for early Seventies proto-metal.  Superficially, just dismiss all the analysis and just give it a well-deserved listen and I guarantee satisfaction.  The album really hits stride with the four shockers `Joker & the Thief, White Unicorn, Woman,' and the riff monster `Colossal,' my personal favorite.  I'm not kidding, I haven't heard music this brave since Nevermind and Ten.  Just a little work needs to be put into their later releases because there was some unnecessarys at the end of the album, but still 4.5 stars.
B000006ZDR|5.0|It was 1981 and Dio had already proven himself a fine replacement for Ozzy with 'Heaven and Hell' ( Ozzy who? ) The old-school Sabbath fans who,at first,dismissed Dio as a second-rate fill-in, quickly changed their tune. 'Mob Rules' was then released and it continued turning on a younger fan base to the mighty Sabbath sound. With an evil Satanic album cover and creepy songs like 'Sign of the Southern Cross' and 'Voodoo', this album spawned another huge hit for Sabbath. Is it as good or better than 'Heaven and Hell'? That's a tough question. It's always hard to follow-up a 'perfect album.' ( Dio's own words ) <br />'E-5150', a bizarre synthesized instrumental blows away Van Halen's wimp-rock album with the same name. The title track screams into rock history and burns a hole into your memory of this amazing and twisted album. Some fans say if you look real close at the bottom of the vinyl album art, you can see \\"Ozzy\\" written in blood! Anything is possible listening to this pounding, unrelenting and classic heavy metal album. What's different about this one? Well, that's easy: Vinnie Appice is the new drummer ( replacing Bill Ward, who quit after losing both of his parents in a short ammount of time) and he's amazing. Returning as Producer is Martin Birch. Recorded in L.A. at the Record Plant. ( This album does have a cool L.A. feel to it, or maybe that was just the joint I was smoking at the time) Iommi's riffs are one-of-a-kind and throw you back as each song hits the speakers. This UK import has outstanding liner notes and color photos from the Mob Rules Tour. Also, the remastered sound makes the vinyl sound like a trash can. This, and 'Heaven and Hell' are must-haves for the true Sabbath or Dio fan.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|North and South, based on the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, is Jane Austen, Charles Dickens and Upton Sinclair taking a walk through Milton.  In these days when we are questioning who has the right to work here and what is a living wage, this reports on the times and projects into the present. Have we really learned how to talk to each other to bridge gulfs of class and other differences? The story starts a little slow, but it warms up in the 2nd episode.<br /><br />The love story starts that way, too. For all her talk of unionists and masters learning to speak to eachother instead of fight, Margaret is a fine one to talk. She can't even talk sincerely about what she wants. (Then again, if she did, there would not be a fabulous 4-hour BBC series.) Through most of it it, I wanted to shake Margaret and her parents, very believable passive aggressive characters played brilliantly. They are an interesting vehicle for exploring Milton and the North and the industrial cloth trade. I fell in love with Higgins, Thornton and Bell and the actors that played them.  Armitage plays Thornton with all the burden, authority, and search for joy - he enjoys his job when everything works.  (I think I have a thing for Yorkshire men.) He cuts a dashing figure, but, more, he strikes a strong realistically ethical cord. Sinead Cusack is so strong and plays Mrs. Thornton with so much complexity. She also, in spite of the harshness of the character, is beautiful - harsh beauty, like a lonely yellow flower hidden in a thicket. The chemistry of the cast and the sense of history transports you.  The commentary on Episodes 1 and 4 are very interesting, but don't listen to them until you watch the whole series.  This is an ace production. Watch it and take the time to be entertained and taught. I think I need to read the novel.
B000002GVO|5.0|Hotel California represents an arrival of sorts for a band who had arguably arrived in grand style several albums ago.  The addition of Joe Walsh sharpened the bands focus on writing great singles.  Previous albums seemed slightly belabored by the musical overhead of being a \\"country-rock\\" concept band.       In a totally different vein, the Eagles catalog as a whole also carries some cultural value. Their work captures a significant California subculture of the 1970s.  Aja by Steely Dan tackles different facets of California at that time.      The primary purpose of this review is to bump the wildly negative review off the front page. Panning the Eagles strikes me as vaguely un-patriotic =)
0393327655|1.0|I first learned of Harris when I saw a great piece he had written for the Huffpost site. I sent the link around and a friend bought this book. She asked me to check out Chapter 4 first. Wow, what a weak piece of analysis. <br /> <br />He seems eager to fit the facts, when they are available, to his premise. In the absence of facts, he just assumes a few in there and bingo, premise supported!  <br /> <br />The polling of Muslim attitudes towards whether violence is justified in support of their religion missed some of the larger countries, for some reason. No problem, if they had been asked, Harris knows just what they would have said, which proves his point. <br /> <br />I wonder how many people in Kansas would say that defending Christainity with violence if need be as a last resort would show much of a different attitude. Onward Christian soldier. And what of the military's use of religion at West Point and other miltiary academies? Coincidence? <br /> <br />If it were only that easy. And when another writer assumed his facts in and was called on it, Harris simply waves his hand and calls the critique invalid, and wishes it all away into the corn field. <br /> <br />Don't let the absence of facts get in the way of a perfectly irrational premise, eh? Oh, and the Israelis are victims, of course. <br /> <br />Weak. I wonder who funded this book?
0671042858|5.0|Stephen King steps off into the woods and gives us Trisha McFarland. She's out for a day of hiking with her mom and brother (who don't get along) when after a quick step off the trail, she becomes lost in the wilderness. This book does not have the same supernatural theme that King normally uses, but this story is uneasy nonetheless. Getting lost in the wilderness is much more real than vampires and werewolves, and King does an excellent job giving us real insight into Trisha's thoughts. This book is one of my favorite Stephen King books.

B000056H24|5.0|'The Greatest Story Ever Told' had the very real potential of being one of the biggest disasters in motion picture history. Think about it for a moment. Who would want to sit through a 3 hour and 19 minute film about Jesus with a virtually unknown blond haired, blue eyed Swedish actor named Max von Sydow in the lead role? Add to that the fact that the artistic integrity of the film was likely to be ruined by the studios decision to populate the feature with a multitude of cameo appearances by just about every living movie star in Hollywood. Sure signs of impending doom surrounded this project.<br /><br />Surely director George Stevens pulled off a major miracle. Aided by one of the finest soundtracks in motion picture history provided by the legendary Alfred Newman, some of the most gorgeous cinematography and set designs you'll ever see and an unforgetable performance by Max von Sydow 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' lived up to it's title to become the definitive film version on the life of Jesus of Nazareth.<br /><br />A classic from '64 that belongs in everyones' DVD library. One of the Essentials!
B00006AW2J|5.0|I'd say that Sticky Fingers and Beggars Banquent are my two favorite Stones releases.  But in all honesty BB is just a little stronger.  I originally got this as a gift in May of 1981 and I've loved it since.  Of course, I've updated to cd now.<br /><br />The following classic song line up has never been matched by any band:<br /><br />1. Sympathy for the Devil<br />2. No Expectations<br />3. Dear Doctor<br />4. Parachute Woman<br />5. Jigsaw Puzzle<br />6. Street Fighting Man<br />7. Prodigal Son<br />8. Stray Cat Blues<br />9. Factory Girl<br />10. Salt of the Earth
B000F8DT4Q|4.0|This stunning album was the pinnacle of 80's UK invasion pop/rock, and a great album with 4 classic singles. An extremely cool reissue, with all the b-sides and 7\\" versions included, and the 12\\" singles section of disc 2 contains Shout (and it's dub), Mothers Talk, and Head Over Heals exactly as they were released on 12\\" single in America, but the version of Everybody Wants To Rule The World is the Urban Mix released in the UK, not the very different and superior \\"Extended Version\\" released on 12\\" in the USA in March 1985.

Don't get me wrong, it does have a few (and I really mean FEW) good tracks, but it does have quite a bit of filler, filler, and more filler. Just when you've enjoyed a solid track you're bored to death with filler. I haven't done heroin, but I'd imagine the crash is probably similar to listening to this album, it even includes a horrible death (last track). <br /> <br />They should have released an EP along with the Live DVD (if that ever happens). <br /> <br />Given the 5 year wait, this is probably the weakest Tool album lyrically (maybe APC wasn't such a good thing afterall). <br /> <br />I'm guessing over the past 5 years Danny spent his time blowing lines, Justin was on some beach, Adam was playing with stereoscopic photography while Maynard pondered a pretentious name for his own wine. It doesn't seem like much thought went into this one until they hit the studio... <br /> <br />Maybe next time they'll do better?
0380789035|5.0|Well you have to give it to him - Gaiman has incredible linguistic skills. In the past 9 months I've read War of the Worlds, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Neuromancer, and Neverwhere. None of which measure up to this in terms of intricacy and flow. While it is an easy read, it is not an easy read. Lots of plots. Keep an open mind - and keep in mind that this is a fictional book. It has nothing to do with what actually happened, or maybe it does, but we'll never know. The positioning of mythology is quite different from anything I've ever read, and Gaiman sucessfully creates a link between westernized and primitive culture.
1400079179|3.0|I reluctantly read this book more out of curiosity as to what all the fuss was about than due to a genuine interest in the story itself.  What I found when I got into it was that it was a truly entertaining story.  It's not really that deep or profound or anything like that...it's just a fun read.  If that were all there was to say, I'd have to give the book four or five stars.  Unfortunately I'm torn because I had some significant problems with the book.  My biggest problems revolve around the huge historical and linguistic inaccuracies rampant throughout the story.  Innacuracies in and of themselves are nothing that would bother me as this is, after all, a fictional novel.  The part that got me was that the author chose to portray the historical details as solid fact, even stating such on one of the opening pages of the book.  Further, he later claimed that he had come to believe his own fictional theories through his work on the book and now wholeheartedly subscribes to them...little strange if you ask me...I hope this never happens to the likes of Dean Koontz or Stephen King, that could get rather messy.  So all in all in the final analysis I found it entertaining but misleading.  Just do your homework and understand you are reading the albeit interesting work of a kook and if you take it for what it is, fiction, all should be well.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I received a call from my brother about this film. He was not quite sure what he had just seen. He thought it may have been great, but did not really trust his own judgement and asked me to see it with him again.  <br />I am not a horror fan, nor have I ever played the games, but I must agree that this was one of the best psychological thrill rides into the depths of horror archetypes ever created.  <br />It seems to be using the basics of dream interpretation of jungian psychology and creating disturbing and relentless images that will disorient and keep one thinking about the movie for weeks after. <br />Even though it is not altogether without flaws, there are some unnecessary explanations, stock dialog and over the top climatic gore - but what this movie excels at is bringing the viewer to a place of wonder and horror, where the demons that populate silent hill are our own.  <br />It is the inner journey of overcoming fear and choosing sides when the division between good and evil are blurred that makes this movie unlike any other of the genre and worthy of 5 stars. <br />
B000002JS6|5.0|I've only heard a small handfull of AC/DC's albums: This, Highway to Hell, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap and High Voltage. Each one has its merits (though High Voltage is weak), but Back in Black is one of the few albums without a bad, or even average, song, and certainly the only AC/DC album to earn that title. If You Shook Me All Night Long was the only good song, I'd still have to give it four stars. Thankfully, there's more to this album than just that. Hells Bells is certainly one of the best opening songs of all time,  kicking off with the tolling of two ton bells, and it just gets better from there, with Brian Johnson spitting out some dark lyrics from the perspective of the Grim Reaper. I dare you to listen to this song and not bust out the air guitar during  Angus Young's brilliant solo. Shoot to Thrill is another great song, proving that no-one, not even Led Zeppelin (whom AC/DC owns, btw) could get down and play loud, dirty rock like these boys. What You Would Do For Money Honey is one of the less famous tracks, really too bad because it's yet another winner, sort of like Led Zeppelin's Living Loving Maid only better. Let Me Put My Love In You and Givin' the Dog a Bone are two very similar songs, both about sex and probably the two weakest songs, but they're still good.<br />Enter the title track, a true heavy metal anthem. It beats Dazed And Confused, Iron Man, Smoke on the Water, Enter Sandman and certainly Welcome to the Jungle to this title. One of AC/DC's best-known riffs is found here, and I love the way Brian drags out the word \\"back\\" so it becomes \\"ba-ha-ha-ha-hack\\" during the chorus. And that's not even the best song here! That goes to You Shook Me All Night Long, in my mind AC/DC's greatest songs. The theme - a guy bragging about getting laid - is nothing new in rock, but between the clever phrasing and the Young brother's nonstop riffs, it truly becomes something to hear. Have a Drink On Me is another one of Back In Black's great lost songs, with very clever lyrics. Shake a Leg is good, but not great.<br />If there's one thing AC/DC loved, it was singing about rock 'n' roll itself. The closing anthem, Rock 'n' Roll Ain't Noise Pollution, is their tribute to one of mankind's greatest inventions. As they say, \\"Rock 'n' Roll Ain't Noise Pollution/Rock 'n' Roll ain't gonna die/Rock 'n' Roll is here to stay/Rock 'n' Roll is just Rock 'n' Roll\\". So true!<br />AC/DC's an interesting band because they have fans who like both classic rock and alternative rock.

B000002I99|5.0|I was one of the lucky people who got to see the television show of this album. Remembering that this was before MTV, seeing someone that was considered to be somewhat of a rebel and counterculture on television at that time was incredible. Naturally I ran out and bought the (vinyl) album.<br /><br />What an album this is. Not quite like his previous albums, \\"Nightmare\\" had a few softer touches, most notably \\"Only Women Bleed,\\" a song about how women in general at that time were considered second class citizens.<br /><br />There are more highlights. \\"The Black Widow\\" has a narrated opening by the incomparable Vincent Price, preceding Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" by quite a few years. My general rule of thumb is that just about anything that Vincent Price ever did on vinyl is excellent, and this narration is perfect for the album and as a lead-in to the song.<br /><br />Listen to the end of \\"Department of Youth\\" cranked up really loud. As the sound is fading Alice Cooper asks the children who has the power, they answer that they do.  Alice then asks who gave them the power, with the expectation that it would be Alice Cooper. The children answer \\"Donny Osmond,\\" setting Alice into a frenzy; a hilarious fadeout.<br /><br />\\"The Awakening\\" is a bit of a chiller that implies the singer has killed his wife. This song is all seriousness, and one of the best songs on the CD.<br /><br />\\"Cold Ethyl\\" is pure laughs; macabre laughs yes, but laugh nonetheless. Cold Ethyl is his lover, but she's cold because she's dead and in the refrigerator. As long as you can handle the subject, the song should make you smile.<br /><br />\\"Devil's Food\\" and \\"Stephen\\" have some rocking moments more characteristic of Alice Cooper, and are both good as well.<br /><br />\\"Some Folks\\" and \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\" are both good.  Each has a mainstream feel to the music though the lyrics are anything but. Perhaps Alice was trying for the contrast between the lyrics and music to give the songs a bit of surrealism. Both songs are enjoyable.<br /><br />\\"Years Ago\\" has Alice talking in a little boy voice in a song that implies something sinister. The song is okay and somewhat unique, but really provides the lead-in to \\"Stephen.\\" While \\"Years Ago\\" might put you off a little at first, listening to it and then \\"Stephen\\" you realize that the two go together, almost as part I and II of the same song.<br /><br />\\"Escape\\" caps off the album. \\"Escape\\" was always a puzzler for me, because it seems to be a bit out of step with the rest of the album. Partially it's due to the lyrics:<br /><br />\\"Where am I running to,<br /><br />There's no place to go.<br /><br />Just put on my makeup,<br /><br />and get me to the show.\\"<br /><br />The way Alice sings these lyrics sounds more like The Beatles than Alice.

B000244FDW|5.0|I believe that everyone should get the version they want; but if you haven't seen either version, it is difficult to tell which you would like, given the reviews here.  Reactions are polarized.  Proponents of each side say their version has the best acting, the best actors, the best scenery, the best photography, etc. etc.  How can you make an informed choice?      1995: The characters (actors) have a personal style, manner, carriage, tone of voice that is more today's people (even though they wear the costumes of the past).  They are livelier.  Their speech, though British, is today's British.  If this appeals to you, the 1980 version will appear slow, the characters stiff, their subtlety baffling or nonexistent.      And this will be true, even if you've read the book.  Readers project onto the characters in a book the attitudes and style they prefer.      1980: In this version, the actors try to behave, comport themselves and speak in a style and manner which they (or the director) believed people used in 1812.  Screenwriter Fay Weldon, who specializes in writing about the British upper class, fashioned a screenplay which attempts to capture this.  If you like to immerse yourself in the past, doing a little imaginative time-travel, this is the version you'll prefer.      The 1995 version will seem to you completely unrealistic, the characters anachronistic, the lavish color wasted, the acting bad, etc.      An indicator: If you know which version of The Forsyte Saga or The Secret Garden you prefer, you can make a good guess as to which Pride and Prejudice you'll like.  The 1996 Forsyte Saga versus the 1967 Forsyte Saga.  The 1995 Secret Garden versus the 1975 BBC Secret Garden.      (You can no longer go by whether it's BBC.  In recent years, the BBC has changed.  It has tried to cash in on the vast American market by tailoring its products to American styles and tastes.)      It isn't about which side is \\"right.\\"  And it makes absolutely no sense to buy both versions!  Get the version you think you're most likely to appreciate.  You may even prefer the 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice if the 1995 version appears \\"too slow\\".
B000EULJLU|4.0|I think I'm the only one reviewing this who has not been a Tool fan forever. Fact is, I had never heard of this band until a few weeks ago, and I generally don't like anything related to metal. But it just goes to show you how keeping an open mind can benefit one's ears. I enjoy this record a lot. It's heavy, but not simplistic, and indeed the band explores some very interesting progressive directions on it. As musicians, clearly these guys are NOT three-chord wonders. They can play, they can write. I know this is nothing new to Tool fans, but to the uninitiated, trust me.....this disc is worth checking out.
B000000I3O|4.0|i just purchased this album, my first misfits album and every song on it rocks (i especially like where eagles dare).  i just bought two more albums, walk among us and static age and i wish they would hurry up and get here in the mail because i cant wait.  my only complain is the sound quality.  it sounds like they put a dollar store tape recorder in the corner and started rocking...but i guess that makes it sound more real too.  metallica covered a couple of their albums on their garage album but it just isnt the same.
B000008LOV|4.0|What to make of the Traveling Wilburys?  If you had never heard the album, the prospect of this collaboration between Dylan, Orbison, Lynne, Petty and Harrison would conjure a couple of different possibilities; a sprawling, haunting master-class in singer-songwriting, or a cluttered, ego-driven car wreck.  That the actual effort resembles nothing even remotely like those two possibilities makes Volume 1 somewhat of an enigma.  What the project produced was a pop-rock album, heavy on the pop.  These guys really wrote this?  The silly and wistful lyrics? The faux-reggae numbers?  The cheeky group-sung choruses?  All tossed together with Jeff Lynne's over-production and whipped into a shiny, cherry-red, rock archetype from a fictional band that stands out of time like it exists in its own universe?  Don't get me wrong, the excecution is masterful.  The singing is impeccable (particularly Orbison's) and the instrumentation sounds like group of crack session musicians that have been at it for decades.  More importantly, the whole thing is really a load of fun...  But if this is what you would expect from the Wilburys, then you are far more prophetic than I. <br /> <br />There are two ways to look at it.  Maybe the group is just goofing off and saving all of their best material for their own albums.  Aside from \\"Handle With Care\\" and \\"End of the Line\\", these tracks would barely be considered filler on each artist's respective solo efforts, so this way of thinking certainly holds water.  However, once you consider the massive collection of song-writing talent and the sly reputation that many of these artists share, it is perhaps even more likely that this over-schlocky piece of Americana was VERY calculated and meticulously crafted to be just that.  It certainly reasons that Bob Dylan, for instance, would have to try to write something as simplistic and fluffy as \\"Congratulations\\".  Could it be that all of this is wrought with a little self-parody?  If the second scenariois truly the case, then The Traveling Wilburys, Vol 1 is just as subversive as any Frank Zappa album, and somewhere between Body Count and Tenacious D on the tongue-in-cheek meter.  And if that's the case, which I really want to believe, then it's a work of pure genius. <br /> <br />So, look at it however you want, but whatever you think, you can't argue that these five guys are having a blast performing these songs, and ultimately that exuberance is what comes across to make this a thoroughly enjoyable album.  It's even more enjoyable to think that their big collective smile comes with a wink, too. <br />
B000EGCITG|5.0|Pink, you define brilliance and what it means to be yourself and express how you feel through your lyrics.  You aren't out to win fans or gain respect by being \\"nice\\" or \\"politically\\" correct.  Thanks for your honesty and for kicking some major butt on this album.  It touches a lot of important topics including the many \\"Stupid Girls\\" who are the hype of the celebrity realm, and the classic \\"Dear Mr. President\\" which gives Mr. Bush a dose of reality without being too brash.<br /><br />I'm glad that you entitled your album \\"I'm Not Dead\\", because you are certainly alive and kickin'!  Keep up the great work and thanks for being yourself in this crazy world of \\"Stupid Girls\\" and carbon-copy artists of today.<br /><br />Favorite songs include Stupid Girls, Who Knew, Dear Mr. President, & Nobody Knows.

0553213105|4.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a pretty good book although there are some dull moments for me as a reader. As for female readers, they will probably enjoy this book greatly and it will most likely become a great book for them. As for male readers, it will probably be dull for you just like me.<br /><br /> The story most of the time is centered on one girl named Elizabeth and there are many fights over whom will marry who. Many events happen and after some of Elizibeth's lovers have been taken by other rich people who have power, she settles over a person called Mr. Darcy who has known their family for many years and seems to notice everything going around and gives an aura of some sort to other people. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy marry and the book ends there.<br /><br /> Overall this book is a pretty good book and I enjoyed some parts of it fairly well.
1400031362|2.0|The first two books in the series were very enjoyable however this book is difficult to get through. The book does not flow like the others. The story of the orphan girl's life is told differently in two of the books. The characters have become dry and the book is a chore to read. I will try the next in the series hoping this was just a one off thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005OAIE|5.0|If you want \\"raw,\\" or if you want \\"profound,\\" this CD is not for you. These are sentimental, emotional songs that mean what they say. There's no obscurity here, no deconstruction necessary. The sentiments are not complex or unusual; they are simple and plain. If you like paintings that look like something, food that tastes like itself, and stories that contain good guys, bad guys, and a resolution, then \\"Room For Squares\\" is for you. And if you're a square yourself, it will be one of your all-time favorites.<br /><br />Best song on the album? The last one, \\"St. Patrick's Day.\\" Its wistfulness and tenderness literally brought a lump to my throat--and its cynicism made me wince. It's a rare songwriter who can pull off a combination like that!
B00005RH3V|5.0|When I first saw Amélie, or Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain, as the original title reads (it's a French movie by the way), I fell in love. The movie is romantic all the way from the core to it's outer edges, it's quirky, creative and well photographed, and it tells the tale of Amélie, a French young woman who works at a café where she tries her hardest to make the people around her happier. Wether it's entertaining the lonely nabour who lost her lover, being nice to the retarded produce guy, or tricking two people to fall in love with eachother, Amélie does it all. You can't help feeling happy after seeing this movie (unless you're completely dull and dim-witted). It's, believe it or not, a romantic comedy that both men and women can enjoy, and it's widely critically acclaimed. Watch it today! (You will not regret it, I promise)
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I paid entirely too much for this sweeper, but that is my own problem.  I am satisfied enough with it's performance that I won't waste my money sending it back to get a refund on it.  I DID however, purchase the extended warranty, as I know how fragile plastic objects can be, and I didn't want to be out the $$ I spent on this if it broke after a year.   <br /> <br />I have found that my sweeper does a great job of cleaning all of my hardwood and linoleum floor surfaces.  I have two small carpets that were cleaned very well with the sweeper, and I will continue using it when I need to clean.  My battery charge is just fine, and it's very lightweight, which is extremely useful as I can get my four year old to clean his room with it.  I live in an apartment, so don't have the need to get an actual vacuum cleaner since there is no real carpeting.  I run my sweeper, which takes the place of my broom and dust pan, then run my dry swiffer over it to get up the dust and lint leftover, and then run my wet swiffer over it to pick up the caked on dirt.  Seems to work well for me.  I actually cheated and bought my swiffer replica at the dollar store, so I'm not actually spending a lot of money to use though, just spent a lot to buy the sweeper vac, but that's exactly what I wanted. <br /> <br />I am overall happy with my product, all the pieces fit together fine, I just found it highly overpriced.
B000002HMH|5.0|Many Metallica fans of the past came into this album with a close mind of what they wanted to hear from Metallica.  They wanted lightning fast riffs, double bass, pretty much everything that Load isn't.  Load is a genious album, simply put.  James Hetfield puts forth his best lyrical effort of any album.  No one can deny that The Outlaw Torn, Bleeding Me, and Until it Sleeps are among Metallica's best songs of all time.  Anyway, don't listen to the close minded naysayers of this ingenious and very moody album.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Before it premiered, the big question about the new series of Dr. Who seemed to be, would Russell T. Davies make it an edgy modern drama or have it return to its traditional family-viewing roots. The answer is that Davies, one of the UK's best script-writers, managed to do both.<br /><br />First thing's first, though, the show is to use the Ninth Doctor's expression, \\"Fantastic!\\" While I've found something to enjoy in nearly every episode of the \\"classic\\" series (which I'll define as everything from 1963 through the one-off movie with Paul McGann in 1996), rarely has the balance of action and humor been so expertly handled. What's more, by focusing solidly on the relationships between the characters and the ways in which the Doctor's actions affect them (particularly Rose's loved ones), the 2005 incarnation of Doctor Who has an emotional heft that the older episodes seldom achieved.<br /><br />Some would argue (and not without merit) that some of the humor is a bit broad. Indeed, the spoofs of reality shows and aliens with gastro-intestinal issues were not the most subtle. On the other hand, the repartee between the characters (especially when Captain Jack joins the party) is often excellent. High marks go not only to series regulars Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper but also to Noel Clarke who plays Rose's boyfriend Mickey and Broadway veteran John Barrowman who plays the dashing (and it turns out truly heroic) Captain Jack Harkness.<br /><br />Both of the latter characters exemplify one of the series key themes, namely that the Doctor makes people realize that they're better than they knew. Mickey helps Rose get back to the Doctor even though he knows he may lose her again. Jack puts his life on the line for the Doctor (not to mention the whole human race) even though it means almost certain death. I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention Simon Callow's excellent guest spot as Charles Dickens and Nicholas Briggs voice-work in the episode \\"Dalek\\" which succeeded in turning one of the show's most famous monsters into a fleshed-out character.<br /><br />Obviously, some of the individual episodes stand out. The two-part WW2-era story The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances in particular is a contender for one of the all-time best from the show's 40+ year history (personally I'm baffled by the assertion an earlier viewer made that this story is somehow out of character with the show's past). That said, in many ways the 13-part series is best seen as a single epic storyline, culminating with a battle for the survival of the entire human race.<br /><br />Of course, we know who wins. It is traditional Doctor Who after all, and good always triumphs over evil. At the same time, this is also every bit a modern TV drama, and good doesn't win without a cost. As we see in episode 13 (The Parting of the Ways), the cost is a steep one for many people. The final moments of this episode are sad but also leave you wanting more. Thankfully, the wait won't be nearly as long this time.<br /><br />Addendum (7/7/06): I noticed that someone expressed a view that the price seemed a bit high. To give some context, the SRP for most releases of older Dr. Who episodes has been $25 (less any discounts), and that's for a program that runs about 2 hours. This new release runs 13 hours for $100 (again less any discounts). In short, the amount of material on this new set compares most favorably to the pricing approach established for previous releases.e show's most famous monsters into a fleshed-out character.

B00079HZUM|4.0|Are masculinity and feminity \\"natural\\" categories that provide individuals with stable identities, or are masculinity and femininity fictional roles that individuals are socially coerced to perform?<br /><br />These are interesting questions but really STAGE BEAUTY is not really interested in entering into any kind of debate or causing anything resembling controversy so it contents itself with examining one man's identity crisis and buries the notion that all of the genders and sexualities portrayed might just be socially coerced performances.  No one in STAGE BEAUTY seems to be perfectly comfortable with their gendered identities and the politically correct sexuality that goes along with it, however, everyone (except Kynaston played by Billy Crudup)is fairly good at acting like they know just who they are sexually and just what they desire in a mate.<br /><br />To its credit STAGE BEAUTY is interested in transgression but it is also interested in being an entertainment and so its moments of transgression are (cleverly or cowardly, depending upon your point of view) almost always presented as moments of comedic trespass.<br /><br />For instance, the pair of giggling young society girls can be attracted to Kynaston so long as \\"he\\" stays in character as a woman and they can veil their sexual interest in \\"him\\" by pretending to believe that he really is a \\"she\\" and that their interest is strictly social. When this veil of propriety drops away, as we know it inevitably will, and the girls openly admit that their interest is more than just social the scene is still recuperable as just a couple of sexually curious girls having some laughs. Just what the young girls curiosity/fantasies might be (it is not certain whether Kynaston being a man or a woman would prove the bigger turn on) is anyone's guess.  In any event the gender confusion is diffused in laughter and as a result the real issues (nature of gender, desire, fantasy) get buried within the comedy.  And whatever thoughts/confusions we may have about this encounter are compounded by the entrance, at the tail end of this scene, of the fop (a stock character in Restoration comedy known for his extravagnt dress, wigs and  affected speech; and also for his indeterminate sexuality)who propositions all three \\"ladies\\" and whose sexual interest in Kynaston does not abate when he discovers that \\"she\\" is really a \\"he\\". Later in the film there will be real repercussions for these transgressions but while they happen they are played for laughs. At times the film promises to delve into gender and sexuality issues but it repeatedly shies away from these themes each time it brings them up.<br /><br />In Restoration comedy the extravagant rake and fop (stock characters in many Restoration comedies ) can show an interest in both sexes but  they only do so (at least in this film) so long as their interest in males is veiled as an interest in females.  In other words Kynaston's lover, the rakish Duke of Buckinghman (played by Ben Chaplin), despite his love affair with the male actor, still perceives himself to be straight (to use a contemporary designation) because he is only interested in Kynaston while Kynaston is acting the part of a woman. Whether this is true or whether the Duke is simply performing in private one identity and in public another (and whether either of these can be said to be \\"real\\" or \\"natural\\" or \\"authentic\\")is debatable. What is not debatable is the fact that sodomy was a hangable offense in the 1670's ( a fact that the film never mentions), and even though the rakish libertine or celebrity actor or actress might be above the law in certain respects the courts were not the only arbiter of \\"moral\\" justice--the mob was less reluctant to punish a transgressive aristocrat or stage celebrity than the courts. Thus even if one takes the view that all identity (public or private) is a performance, some performances can be viewed to be coerced by convention, by law, and by public opinion. This was a time in which transgression held an irresistable allure and danger and one in which noble women as well as prostitutes often wore masks when attending the public theatre (and it was often difficult to tell which was which).  It is also a period in stage history when the actresses on stage often were considered to be little more than prostitutes. In order to present Claire Danes as an innocent spectator just absorbing the ambience of the theatre until she gets her big chance the film has to steer clear of a lot of interesting and lewd history. Nell Gwynn, the Kings mistress, would become one of the most famous actresses of her day. Though Kynaston was a real person, Maria (played by Claire Danes), the dresser and would-be actress, is an invention--scholars still cannot determine who exactly was the first English stage actress. And this character never really feels like anything but an anachronism. Claire Danes is a fine actress but her bright and cheery manner, her confident though subdued sexuality, and her super-sensitive and wholesome womanliness, feel like she is just there to keep things in the realm of the safe and the familiar.  If she can understand and sympathize with the self-aggrandizing, vain, and narcissistic Kynaston (the filmmakers seem to say) then so can we. Though some representations of masculinity and femininty are presented for critique, the notion of feminity that Claire Danes represents is offered as a natural version of femininity. Even though he is arguably not quite the right actor (I don't think anyone is going to mistake Crudup for a lady) for this role Billy Crudup does a terrific job with the part and though we never quite like Kynaston as a person we can't help but want to see him through his dilemna.<br /><br />This is also a period of time in which the public and the private were beginning to be viewed as separate spheres. And each of the characters in this play view the stage and the stage version of \\"self\\" and/or \\"beauty\\" in their own way. Betterton (played by Tom Wilkinson), the lead actor and leader of the company, has no problem distinguising between his public and private persona. And the King (played whimically by Rupert Everett) and his mistress are apparently fond of donning each others clothes on a private stage for fun. Kynaston, however, has a hard time making the distinction between his on-stage and off-stage selves. He does view his \\"femininity\\" as an act and yet it is an act that he has played in public for so long that, by force of habit, this performance has become a reality or identity for him. And when we see him in private he is never certain what or who \\"he\\" is. Therefore when a law is passed by the King that men shall no longer play women on stage, Kynaston experiences not only a professional but a personal identity crisis as well.<br /><br />Kynaston's dresser Maria shows a sexual interest in him from the beginning and, eventually, she will become the first woman to play a woman's part on the English stage and she does so, ironically, by expropriating Kynastons affected femininity. I think the fact that Claire Danes is copying Billy Crudup's verion of femininity is funny to contemporary audiences for obvious reasons but that interesting thesis evident in so many early scenes (that gender may well be an act; that all people may not be all feminine or all masculine but an interesting blend of both) gets lost when the film ceases to be about anything but a romance between two attractive stars, Danes and Crudup. The formulas of the entertainments of our own day (love interest a necessity to have a hit in a Hollywood production), therefore, are always competing and interfering with this films attempt to examine the gender and entertainment formulas of another time period.<br /><br />And the final scene where Kynaston attempts to play that most masculine of male roles, Othello, to the dresser's Desdemona transgresses in another way. Restoration drama was all about theatricality and the theatricality on the stage commented on the theatricality of society. The stage was a place where the constraints of social norms and forms, as well as the eternal battle between reason and the passions, could be examined. In keeping with the theme of the film it would seem that what we should get in this final perfomance of Othello is some comment about socially coerced gender roles. STAGE BEAUTY,in this final scene, however, forgets what its about and it forgets what time period it is examining and instead of socially and theatrically embedded characters and performances we get a comment on the relationship between fake violence and real violence (it would seem that when you really try to kill someone it is much more real than when you just fake it). You could argue that this scene is meant to be a comment on the realtionship between real life and the stage (and it is to a certain extent that) but if it is that then the film is saying that men should play men parts and women women parts because only then can the stage approach the \\"realism\\" to which it aspires. But then that really solves nothing because it just means that what audiences want from a theatrical performance is just a simulation of the real and not a comment or critique on the nature of the real (or the fact that what we experience as \\"natural\\" or \\"real\\" is mediated by culture and society). By most accounts the audiences of the 1660's were a very sophisticated coterie of aristocrats and wealthy citizens and we can presume that they were interested in more than just the thrill of simulated death scenes.  Anyway \\"realism\\" and/or \\"naturalism\\" have never been the aristocrat's forte. What the arsitocrats presumably wanted were penetrating, albeit theatricalized for effect, glimpses of themselves. And for the most part that is what restoration playwrites gave them.  Shakespeare was not particularly respected by Restoration playwrites--they perceived his naturalism to be coarse and vulger and much preferred their own artful affectation (wich they considered to be a \\"second\\" and superior nature)-- and so they rewrote his plays to \\"improve\\" them and make them suitable for (what they perceived to be) their own much more sophisticated tastes. The new ending of Othello, however, provided by Hatcher/Eyre seems more geared toward Hollywood tastes and expectations than geared toward a Restoration audiences tastes and expectations.  Restoration audiences were not immune to the allure of melodrama and sensual demostration but the melodramatic acting technique displayed by these actors, the realism or raw emoting, or whatever Hatcher/Eyre were going for does not fit the period's  ideas about acting and the role of the actor.  The trumped up Hollywood death scene/murder scene that is not a death scene/ murder scene destroys any period specific integrity the film may have had and erases what the film purported to be about. And the fact that these two characters faun over each other after the real onstage violence is inexplicable. I am still uncertain with my own interpretation of the ending.<br /><br />To give the film every benefit of the doubt I would say that the ending is meant to show that Kynaston finally learned to find the beauty in playing a man (or found the beauty in the role of Othello as well as in the role he formerly played, Desdemona). But this is a problematic ending which resolves nothing of Kynaston's own gender and sexual confusions--unless it means that he has finally become comfortable playing either male or female roles. However, reading the ending this way does not explain the onstage violence (unless we view it as an act of generosity to his co-star and the audience: the real violence generated a real response from his co-star who otherwise could not act, a performance to which the audience responded positively).  But that seems a ridiculous and implausible explanation. I think the movie wants us to believe that Kynaston was carried away by the moment and that he was working out his own issues while playing Othello. This reading of the ending would suggest that Kynaston's style of acting was a kind of psychodrama. And it would also suggest that he has finally found a part that he can really sink his teeth into, and it would suggest that the reason he can sink his teeth into it is because it is a male role. But this would not be consistent with earlier claims in the film and so it would make the film thematically inconsistent. Or, you could read the ending to mean that Kynaston can only be a person on stage and that no matter what part he is performing that is who he becomes.  This sounds absurd but at least it has the merit of remaining consistent with earlier claims about the performative nature of identity made in the film. And it also remains consistent with Kynaston's final statements about still not knowing who he is. Maybe on the stage-in the heat of a performance--is the only place where he can find beauty and identity.<br /><br />Another interpretation of the ending might go like this:  Kynaston has confused life and art; as well as confused his private and public identity.  In murdering Desdemona he is murdering his former self or attempting to. The murder would thus be a symbolic act, a ritual purging of his former role/self-- perhaps in an attempt to be reborn, publicly, on stage, as a male actor capable of playing men.  If he doesn't actually kill her it is because he finally realizes that there is a difference between life and art and between public and private performances. But if this is the case then it would seem that Claire Danes' character is ok with the fact that he had to almost kill her to arrive at such a revelation. The audience's final gasp is one of relief that Maria is still alive and exasperation at this brilliantly acted new ending of the play that was, for once, a total surprise.<br /><br />In real life Kynaston made the adjustment, changed with the times,and enjoyed success in male roles (at one point he played a female lead in a play one week and the male lead in the same play the next week).<br /><br />The film is so unusual and this period is so interesting that I would recommend it even with its peculiar failings and anachronisms.<br /><br />Whatever interpretation you come up with, the ending is vague at best.

0393317552|4.0|Jared Diamond's book, \\"Guns Germs and Steel\\" was a required read for our Historical Geography class. It's an interesting read that includes a some biology, some anthropology, some geography, some other sciences, some history and some interesting theories about why Europe conquered the world (i.e. the Americas and Africa) while the Incas and other groups never pursued conquering other nations across the seas.   Diamond focuses on various issues including hunters/gatherers versus sedentary societies which spring up as domestication of animals and plants occur. Of course, with sedentary groups comes hierarchy and governments and disease as the group settles into one place living closer to one another and with animals. These groups eventually gain immunities to various diseases and with their resources obtained thru trade and knowledge they explore and being to conquer other nations.   Granted, Diamond is using theory to explain why some cultures and societies have made so much progress while others are still lagging far behind, but his theories are interesting and when you finish the book it will have you thinking about the world we live in and the \\"luck\\" that some societies have had over other societies based purely on geography.
B0007PLLQ0|5.0|When the dvds became popular I awaited LEGEND umpatiently, now this double dvd of the film made a fantasy come true.  Despite of the early acting skills (the main characters manage a fine work though, specially Tim Curry and Mia Sara, it's her movie) the story line and great directiong from Scott brings out the basic inner feelings we all have since we were children, we identify with one or several characters and we can almost play along and live the story ourselves, we learn from bad and good, light and darkness, friendship and foes, loyalties and betrayal, love and hate... we also learn that even the \\"pure of hearts\\" are human and as imperfect as we are, the is exploration on the \\"possible evil\\" inside us, Princess Lili is the case; manipulative and selfness (the most realist role here), justifying her own \\"innocent\\" motivations ---she comes around of course and ultimatelly she saves the day at the end by betraying Lord Drakness in saving the unicorn mare... Cruise's role is good too though too much goodness can be a little plain, he holds his own with his etheral charm, Curry does his most dramatic make-over past his suite, satanic, seductive, really scary, the goblins and elfs are magic as the forest itself down to Darkness cave... <br /> <br />The extras inside the dvds are great and i think each pennie was worth paying for, as a fine item on my dvd collection, also if you can get the Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack on cd, the musical journey is equally magical, even the so-called US release's Tangerine score makes it part as well. <br /> <br />LEGEND as a fantasy fan myself os one of my favourite films ever, love watching over and over and talk friends into watching it with me every chance I get.  GET IT. <br /> <br />Kala Tremitti
B000EMG6UW|5.0|Listening to this album, it is not difficult to tell where Pink Floyd gained some of its unique sound from. Aside from that, there are lots of great songs on here showcasing David's brilliant musicianship. The title track features a truly style-defining guitar solo, whereas tracks like \\"Then I Close My Eyes\\" and \\"Take A Breath\\" are particularly well-arranged. Other more straight-forward  songs like \\"This Heaven\\" and \\"Smile\\" also add to the album's feeling of overall peace and comfort. The closing track \\"Where We Start\\" is a wonderful ode to growing old with a significant other. <br />This is not Pink Floyd, it's David Gilmour, who is a great musician in his own right and proves here that he does not need any help from his fellow band mates to create a brilliant album of good music, although he did not mind having Richard Wright play on a few of the tracks.

It covered the realities of the economic environment and what distinguishes people who accumulate wealth from others.<br /><br />Most of the ideas in this book are simple and in many cases they were just a validation of things I already knew.  However, it brought the most important concepts for financial independence home in a sometimes powerful way.<br /><br />I think this would be a good book for young people to get a realistic perspective on their finanical future and the need to start saving early.  Sometimes it's easy to forget that when it comes to wealth, it's not what you earn that counts, but what you save and what you do with those savings over a lifetime.<br /><br />This is an excellent resource for anyone who is interested in accumulating wealth.  There is very little hype here and a lot of practical facts.
B00005JKC3|4.0|I admit this movie was very dissapointing because in alot of eyes it turned out to be a let down and in some ways it was. <br />My thoughts are it was an excellent film that described the life of Bruce Banner and how he came to hold the gene that would turn him into the Hulk. <br />There was over the course of the movie too much going on at any one time that would distract you from what you were ment to focus on and after that scene would end you would have to repeat the scene because you missed something and in my eyes that isn't good. <br />The only really positive parts of the movie where the special effects & the action scenes. Eric Bana's performance was mediocre at best and in parts of the movie it was very hard to take him as the character seriously. <br />Apparently they are in the process of making a sequel and Eric Bana is even considering taking the part again, they aren't using the same director and to me that's a good thing because the movie had the potential to be the best ever and it wasn't so let's hope the new Hulk movie is better than the first which in my opinion was great anyway.
0689878451|5.0|This book is absolutely wonderful: the illustrations are soft, wonderfully executed, and accurate inasmuch as how Central Park Zoo looks.  I picked up this book out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised at how the authors emphasize how love and family go hand in hand no matter if it's two moms, two dads, or yes, even two penguins and a ball of fluff that comprise it. It is definitely a book I would pass on to any child to teach them about the nature of love and diversity and any adult willing to teach that lesson. My only regret is that there aren't more books out there like this, and more people willing to open their minds and hearts to its message: bravo Tango, and bravo Parnell.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Serenity picks up six months after the cancellation of the TV series Firefly and we see what has become of the crew of the spaceship Serenity. Serenity does in about two hours what the series should have/would have done over the life of the show had it been allowed to continue. In a way this is a bad thing for fans of the show because had the series went on the events of the movie would have played out over a much longer time building the tension further and giving the viewers more insight to the characters. Fortunatly, there came the movie to tie up the loose ends as to all the why's that fans did not know.<br /><br />  Serenity delivers on all fronts. It gives the viewer action and adventure and allows the charactors to give out a little revenge of their own on the 'evil' forces out there looking to stop them. All the original charactors are back, though not all have as much time as they would have during the series. Even though the loose ends are tied up (at least with River) the ending leaves open the possiblity of another follow up movie. Best case scenario for fans of Firefly would be a new movie and an even better case scenario would be a series of TV movies on a cable channel.<br /><br />  If you have never seen the series Firefly, rent or buy it on DVD to catch up before watching Serentiy (though the opening scenes do bring the viewer up to partial speed as to why the crew does what it does.<br /><br />  Either way, Serenity is a good piece of old fashioned Sci-Fi action.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Why was everyone so hard on this movie? I loved it.    I am a huge fan of the show.  But I also know that, realistically, there is no way to film it without rearranging and cutting (cutting A LOT) and what have you.  The show is all over the place, but it works because of the music and the massive energy of everyone on stage.  You can't help but be sucked in, and when the first notes of \\"Seasons of Love\\" enter your ears, you'll be more than tempted to sing along.  But getting back to the movie...    The movie has a few things going for it:      -The cast (six of the original eight, as if you don't know) is wonderful.  There is an easy camaraderie between the principles, which makes a lot of the dialogue more believable.  They all look and sound as if they are having fun, and that tends to be contagious even on screen.  Idina Menzel isn't as over the top and obnoxious as she was on stage, though she still has her moments.  Tracie Thoms steals the show...she was born to be Joanne, honestly.  And Wilson Jermaine Heredia is heartbreakingly charming beginning to end.  As for the Daphne/Rosario debate, Daphne's Mimi always frightened me slightly.  She reminded me of that tough girl in high school that you just NEVER crossed because if you did, you would die.  She grew up quick because she didn't have any other choice.  Rosario Dawson's Mimi is more vulnerbale and (dare I say it) naiive.  When Roger says she looks sixteen, she's almost too eager to correct him.  There's a certain tenderness she brings to Mimi, and that's not a bad thing.  She gives a surprisingly strong vocal performance (though I don't think her voice would be able to survive 8 shows a week), and the chemistry between her and Adam Pascal is just something else.    -While it IS a treat to see the original cast reunited (for the most part), the music is the real star of the show.  I love my OBC recording more than life itself, but the music is only enhanced by this production.  Seasons of Love (with TracieThoms voice simply soaring in the solo) is moved from the beginning of the second act, but this version breathes new life into the song...something I never thought possible.  Jesse Martin's voice just got better with age, and if you don't believe me, listen to I'll Cover You (reprise).  Tango: Maureen and Take Me or Leave Me are absolute show stoppers here, probably because of Idina's post-Wicked popularity.  And La Vie Boheme is STILL the salute to all things Bohemian that it always was.  You can't help but love it.  The only song I really had a problem with was Halloween (they cut it out of the final version of the film).  It sounds slightly over-produced because of the very personal nature of the lyrics.  The music is too prominent on that track for my liking, but Anthony Rapp can always be counted on.    -The story always treads the line between poignant and cheesy very VERY dangerously, so the finale could have very easily been disasterous.  But it's handled beautifully, and to be honest, I was crying too hard to care.  I'll warn you: if you've lost anyone to AIDS, then their face is bound to come to your mind during this film.  Also, most of the sung dialogue in the show is spoken here, which for me is a MAJOR plus.  I have never understood the whole \\"Let's sing the entire movie\\" thing.  Singing through the dialogue works on stage, but on film, its tiresome.    The only real complaint I have about the whole thing is the exclusion of Contact, a song from the show.  I know, realistically, no one would be able to pull THAT performance off on film.  But it is one of the best, and most creative, moments of the entire show.  Without spoiling anything, the event that Contact deals with is dealt with wonderfully in the movie, but it's more cliche.    The second DVD is a MAJOR must-see.  Just don't make the mistake of watching it right after the movie finishes.  I did...and I couldn't get through it.  The main feature on Disc Two is the extremely informative and powerful documentary \\"No Day But Today.\\"  You'll learn about the life of Jonathan Larson and the creation of Rent.  While watching it, I was filled with an obscene amount of respect for the man.  It tells his life story, so when his family and friends recall his death, you're just as emotional as they are at the absurd timing of it.  It's obvious that they are still trying to come to terms with his death.  But if you think about it, it makes creepy sense.  Rent was the biggest thing he would EVER do, and when he did that, he died.  I firmly believe he was put on Earth to give us Rent, which is exactly what he did.  So thank you Jonathan Larson.      There are other special features.  The deleted scenes are great because of the songs (I don't know WHY Goodbye Love and Halloween were cut).  The alternate ending isn't as moving as the one they used, but it's still touching in its own right.  The commentary is amusing, particularly a comment Adam Pascal makes about the scene in Santa Fe reminding people of the Britney Spears movie - which (for the record) had not crossed my mind until he pointed it out.  Personally, that was one connection I could have done without.      Rent is really about making the most of the time you're given in life.  You can't argue with that.  The music, the characters, the story, even the story of Rent's creation, come together to deliver that message.  And trust me, if you're feeling low for whatever reason, this movie will do nothing if not comfort you on some level.  So grab the kleenex, sit back, and just enjoy the ride.  You won't regret it.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Arguably the best superhero movie of all time, and certainly the first decent one, is Superman: The Movie.  <br /> <br />From the rousing opening credits to the iconic fly-by at the end, the film remains one of the most enjoyable spectacles you could ever see and even improves on dvd. The sound and picture quality is excellent although the full anamorphic frame is not always utilised in terms of setting scenes, it still looks great on a big tv.  <br /> <br />Of course everyone knows the story, but what may surprise newcomers is the time frame in which it happens. Roughly 15/20 minutes are spent on Krypton, and another 25 minutes or so describing Clark Kent's early life. Many criticize this section for various reasons, including Brando's overpriced cameo. However, I think it adds to the epic scale of the film and makes it a true classic.  <br /> <br />Christopher Reeeve IS Superman. His performance in both guises is spot-on and everything that he does manages to make you either smile or cheer. Gene Hackman is given plenty of one-liners and (too many) slapstick gags, but still comes across well as the genius who may just get the better of the Man of Steel. Margot Kidder is also terrific as Lois Lane, and although she gets a better-written part in the sequel, she captures the awe and amazement that we are all feeling.  <br /> <br />The effects are probably the only thing that breaks the film up and (ironically) takes you away from the film's world. Although very impressive at the time, I'm sure, you just can't believe some of the flying images. Dont get me wrong,I hate CGI, but some of the rear projection shots don't seem to match with Supes' movements occasionally - for instance, one shot over the city sees Superman turning in the air, but the background seems to zoom in and pan etc. even though he's just turning...  <br /> <br />But nevertheless, the overall tone and good-natured spirit of the film, combined with some of the more poignant moments, makes this an awesome feat and easily worth owning on dvd.
1400079179|1.0|What is all the fuss about? At best this novel is a mindless page turning thriller. I admit the preface is intriguing, but the writing was so rudimentary I found myself wishing it was in comic book form...then at least I'd have a better description of the characters.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't have such a problem with this book had it not been masqueraded as 'the novel of the century' or 'the best book ever'.<br /><br />The only thing this novel left me wanting to do was tally the amount of times Mr. Brown used the word 'aura' and compare it to the amount of times he used the word 'the'...admit it, you're curious too.

B00005JP01|3.0|The cast in this movie was extremely well chosen, and they all acted very well.  Sean is a reckless, charming, somewhat troubled teenager, but he doesn't come across as stupid and careless--despite his angst and frequent bungles, he is immediately likable.  When a car race with a peer at his school results in two wrecked cars and extensive damage to a local construction site, the only alternative he has to jail is to move to Tokyo and live with a relative (his father, I thought, but maybe his uncle...).    In Tokyo, Sean quickly discovers the racing scene.  After trashing a race car, he has no choice but to work for Han, the car's owner, as compensation.  Han is by far the best character in this movie, to the point that he seems out of place--you just don't expect a character THAT good in this sort of action flick.  Han is a whimsical, philosophical and intense character.  He completely upstages Sean and almost from the first moment you see him, calmly eating his chips while he watches Sean destroy his expensive race car, you want to see more of him.    Much of the movie's impetus comes from D.K. and Neela.  D.K., short for \\"Drift King,\\" is the top racer in the area and the nephew of a local yakuza boss.  He's partners with Han and is obsessed with Neela, a peer of Sean's at school.  D.K. dislikes Sean immediately, noting Sean's interest in Neela and tensions between the two of them escalate throughout the movie, leading to the \\"climax\\" which is a night race down an extremely windy road out in the middle of nowhere.  The races in general are pretty entertaining and are a good length, time-wise.    This was a good flick with a few really excellent qualities.  The plot was a little hazy but there was one, and the characters were very well developed.  Just the Han character made it worth seeing, for me.  I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys action movies.  It was at last as good as the previous two movies in the series.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|I first saw Daredevil in the cinema and to be fair to it, its not a bad film. But it is particularly average, nothing really special. In fact to me it was a bit of a dissapointment, I'd really wanted more from it.  <br />Fast forward to now and anyone in the same position as me really really should watch the directors cut. Why this wasnt made the theatrical release I don't know! It improves on the original in every possible way. <br /> <br />The film is generally a lot darker, showing the real price Matt Murdock pays for being Daredevil. Theres an amazing scene expaned upon where he comes back from dealing with a rapist and he reveals his back to show many many scars and you get a great sense of his unhappiness. Also added is a new sub plot that deals with a man falsly accused of murder and Matt's defence of him as he follows the trail all the way back to the king pin. All of this helps build the finale up to more than just vengence for a lost girlfriend but for all of hells kitchen.  <br /> <br />On top of that the completely redundant sex scene is removed which doesnt detract from his relationship with Electra, far from it, instead it builds it up into something purer and more special than it was before and more tragic when he loses her. The end fight with the kingpin is expanded uopn in a way that feels natural rather than forced, as if thats exactly how it should have been first time round.  <br /> <br />On top of this there have been lots of small touches included into the new edit, the emphasis on the catholic influences upon Murdocks life as well as a reference to his mother that fans of the comic will love. The parts of Ben Urich and Matt's law partner have been new and expanded scenes that all benefit the film.  <br /> <br />I really cant stress enough how much of an improvement this is, even if you loved the first cut you should watch this, I'm sure you'll be amazed! The darkness and humanity of the character have been brought to life superbly, and the endresult is all the better for the changes.
0316168815|2.0|I'm not really sure how to describe my thoughts on this novel...  On the one hand I found it thought provoking and I really appreciated Sebold's vision of heaven, but on the other I really found myself waiting to love the book.  Well sad to say that moment never came.  I just kept thinking that I was really glad that I hadn't just lost a loved one, because instead of finding the book theraputic I just found it awkward.    This book does portray human struggles, but I wouldn't give it to someone who is struggling.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|michael, i'll save the last dance for you anyday. <br />after seeing your concert at radio city last year you captured my listening heart - forever. <br />how you can sing so softly and purely at times, and then step it up to that powerful and pure level is awesome to me. <br />it's time is really really good. <br />
B000059XUI|5.0|Superman II is perhaps the only decent attempt at realistically adapting a super hero to the big-screen. From a brilliant opening sequence, the continuous run of action sequences that follows are conducted with some aplomb by director Richard Donner, which some exellent special effects for 1980 and unnumerable edge-of-your-seat moments. <br /> <br />The film is not overly-serious (Gene Hackman is in fact a great comedy actor too) and the storyline is, for once, excellent. The mid-air battle sequence over Metropolis between Superman and the three Krypton criminals (ie, 3 x Superpeople) makes for genuinely exciting viewing.  <br /> <br />I am certainly not a fan of this film genre, as they usually decend into dumbed-down, cartoon-esque movies designed for audiences with the attention span of a goldfish. However, Superman II is a clear exception to the rule that super hero movies cannot be well-photographed, have a half-decent storyline and be genuinely riveting for their audiences. <br /> <br />Superman II thus stands as a classic of its kind (albeit because no other such movie in this genre comes close), so Sam Raimi, look no further for references as to how to make a great super hero flick.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended, but please don't watch the god-awful sequels !
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This was startling initially because of the shabbiness/drabness of the initial setting -- Keira amongst the chickens?  But once you get over this change to a realistic scene rather than one of grandeur and glitz set by past versions, the realization that the changes are for the better grow on you -- The characters are warmer, younger, and what I liked best about it was the change from the one dimensioned silliness of the mom in the BBC version --<br /><br />In the BBC version, you would wonder how one could be attached to so silly and horrid a woman there, but here, the family is portrayed with a warmth that makes the story much more real -- Lizzie's attachment to her family and their plight is more believable as coming from Love rather than just Duty.  And you can see the woman her father fell in love with and had 5 children with -- The biting relationship in the BBC series between the parents made me wonder how they ever had five children when he so clearly despised his wife.<br /><br />The sweaty lively assembly brought to life the energy in social dance.  I loved the movie!  I could only wish there were as many hours to be spent with these characters as in the mini series, but they've done a wonderful job with the movie.
B0000CFW87|4.0|Remember that guy who plays a singer (Malcolm Wyatt) facing the tough task of singing in front of his whole class at his Prom? Yes, I am talking about Josh Groban. I cannot think of someone who would have missed to notice the combination of force and beauty in his voice.    'Closer' is his second album released in 2004 (his first was released in 2001).     'Closer' and his first album were recommended to me by my colleague who also gave me these two albums to listen to - and I still feel thankful to her for introducing me to the wonderful world of Josh. The one track I couldn't wait to hear was 'Confession'. I so loved his voice and the music that I was almost drawn into the magic of his world. I was actually trying to sing along with him when this song played.    I, for one, listen to varying kinds of music, and this album, being fit to be called a 'commercial classic' album, became my instant favorite. There were few evenings when I would not turn on my stereo and play this album, not to mention that I also played it as soon as I woke up in the morning.    The other important fact to note about it is that many of the songs are either in Italian, Spanish or French, and only some are in English. Nevertheless, each song is a gem in itself, and none of them can be relegated to the back-burner as boring.    And in the world of singers who depend on instruments and electronics to enhance their voice, Josh stands staggeringly tall and independant. For his tenor the music just provides a forum - a background - on which his voice plays an independant role bringing out the emotion and the depth it demands.    Here is the list of songs in this album, along with the points I would give them on a scale of 10 -     * Oceano (Italian) - 8/10  * My Confession (English) - 10/10  * Mi Mancherai (Il postino) feat. Joshua Bell (Italian) - 8/10  * Si Volvieras a Mi (Spanish) - 8/10  * When You Say You Love Me (English) - 9/10  * Per Te (Italian) - 8/10  * All' Improvviso Amore (Italian) - 10/10  * Broken Vow (English) - 9/10  * Caruso (Italian) - 8/10  * Remember When It Rained (English) - 9/10  * Hymne A L'Amour (French) - 8/10  * You Raise Me Up (English) - 8/10  * Never Let Go (English) - 8/10    Personally though, even though I don't speak a language other than English, I loved all the songs in this cd either for the music or Josh's rendition of them. Basically, I can say that you would like the songs by themselves, even if you didn't understand Italian, Spanish, or French as the case may be. Each song has its own charm, what with the instruments playing along beautifully, and Josh's voice and the instruments' music blending in perfectly.    Well, listening to all the songs, and imagining what the producers/writers/composers would have wanted us to imagine, I could conjure up the following picture in my mind - that these were songs sung by a person who has loved to the fullest, but has made mistakes, and all he is left with now are the memories of what was once a powerful and potent love. The listener is taken through varying emotions as conveyed by the lyrics, the music, and Josh's tenor.    I am extremely happy that I have been introduced to the wonderful auditory/musical world of Josh, and that this album deserves a 5/5 in all the departments I could think of. Give it a try!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This is a great CD. AND if you can catch them in concert this summer so much the better. I just caught their gig in Washington DC last night and it was amazing.  The band that Mark Knopfler has put together is so talented--so much talent on one stage! Emmylou is one of the greatest singer/songwriters of our generation and the women never ages! She is so beautiful. I hope they do more together because they have a great chemistry on the CD and on stage--it's electric.The CD is full of gems and I personally am grateful that both ELH and MK keep recording. I am so sick of the music that is out there today--this CD just makes me smile.  Thanks Emmoylou and Mark Knopfler for all the great music and the DAR Constitution Hall concert rocked.
B000002V0Q|4.0|I've been a big Megadeth fan since KIMB, have seen Mustaine in concert, and own all of the Megadeth releases to date (as of 2006. The only Remaster version I have is of MD45, of which I have the original version and the remaster.) <br /> <br />Countdown is one of my favorites, rivialing the first 3 releases of KIMB, Peace, and So Far. It's a heavy metal album, but the songs also stick in your head and have catchy choruses and riffs. All in all another stellar CD from the Mustaine crew. I give it 4 stars because it's not quite up to par with KIMB or Peace Sells but it's still great. It's in my top 5 Megadeths for sure. Standout tracks include Skin of My Teeth, Symphony of Destruction, Foreclosure of a Dream, Sweating Bullets, and High Speed Dirt. I can listen to this CD from start to finish without skipping a track. If you are into Megadeth, this is a must have.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|The movie has just ended, and for that I am grateful. It has been two hours of sincere unpleasantness. So why did I bother with it? Well, to write this review. Now that I've finished watching, I realized that I could have stopped watching within the first 30 minutes, because there wasn't much that changed. I thought it was a train wreck initially, and I didn't change my mind. <br /> <br />This was an utter, complete mess. The attempts at cleverness with regard to twisting the Grimm's tales failed miserably, with one exception, and it succeeded only marginally. If I mention it, I will have put a spoiler into the review, so I won't. <br /> <br />That Terry Gilliam directed this is unbelievable. I would have thought him far too good for such a wretched disaster. <br /> <br />Damon and Ledger were serviceable, in their performances, but they had no chemistry together. The one scene that could have offered some form of chemistry came far too late, and was snatched away from us just in the nick of time. The one true moment of the film, and it never happened. What a pity. <br /> <br />So they were charlatans, then ended up fighting real monsters, and then, we suppose, wrote their grim tales based on their experiences - giving \\"clever\\" twists to their resulting stories based on the \\"facts\\". I so want to say that I loved how clever it was, but I can't. It was only marginally clever. And whatever cleverness there was, there was a complete lack of suspense that overrode everything. With all of the action, the near death scenes, the real death scenes - there should have been enormous suspense and extremely enjoyable action. <br /> <br />Nope. Wasn't there. <br /> <br />Even the scenes that were supposed to be funny were flat. This evoked zero emotion from me. It should not have. <br />
B00005V0X5|5.0|I own the non-remaster version of the CLASSIC first Megadeth album, commonly known as KIMB. I had the original pressing with an unedited These Boots, but my friend lost it, so I bought another copy but it was missing the Nancy cover song. Oh well, it was OK but really the weakest song on an otherwise flawless CD. KIMB is non-stop thrash metal bliss from opening to end. Every track is awesome. The opening track is haunting and scary and then just flat out kicks a**. And you won't stop to take a breath until the entire CD is finished. It's THAT good. I'd say the standout tracks are Killing is my Business, Skull Beneath the Skin, Chosen Ones, and Looking Down the Cross (this song is brutal, I get chills listening tio the lyrics and incredible musicianship). Mechanix has better music than Metallica's Four Horsemen, but Metallica took the cooler lyrics. Chris Poland's lead guitar work is amazing. Gar on the drums... you have to hear it to believe it. The original Megadeth line-up with Poland and Gar was never beat. True metal legendary album. 5 stars all the way. An essential must have CD.
1577314808|5.0|I have just read the Power of Now whilst on vacation.  I think it is an amazing book that will help me to enjoy every moment of my life.  Life is short and to appreciate every moment can only be a blessing.  Having read lots of the other reviews, I can see that this book is not something for everyone, but for me it was just meant to be.  It has helped me to be aware of my mind, to appreciate the miracles in life and that can only have a beneficial effect on all aspects of my life.  I now look forward to reading the next one of how to practice the power of now!  We get so caught up in this world, in stress and everyday life it's refreshing to be reminded of now!  So I highly recommend this book .... if it's what you need now!
B000002UB3|5.0|I first purchased Abbey Road in the late 1970's.  I was familiar with several of the hits off the album (Come Together, Something) - but that was it.  Overall, this was, and is, a wonderful album, capping off a brilliant career by four very creative men.  It's hard for me to come up with a 'favorite Beatles song' (there are so, so many), but I think George Harrison's 'Here Comes The Sun' might be it.  I think the guitar artistry within the gorgeous melody continues to stun me, even after hundreds of listens.  The instrumental in the middle of the song leading up to the crescendo is great.  These guys really were amazing (!)
B00005JOSS|5.0|watching The Lake House. This movie is beautiful, captivating, and mysterious. It must have touched a spot deep down in my heart which made me feeling blue afterwards. But, I cannot explain why I feel this way because my left brain was on a break when it happened.  And, speaking honestly, I don't really mind that! <br /> <br />Not using left brain is a miracle for a person like me.  I will give this movie 6 stars if I can.

B0000AUHOH|2.0|Sometimes in Hollywood movie franchises, successful ones that is, hit snafus along the way.  With any luck these mistakes won't sink the franchise permanently, but they generally cause some loss of respect and fan appreciation for a series.  'Star Trek' has been one fortunate franchise, after starting off slow and boring with \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\", a movie that almost sunk the franchise before it got started, a mistake that most movies never get to overcome.  However, Paramount and the creative team behind the films felt strongly enough in their product to continue forward with the series (of course the hefty profits of the first film helped in this decision), and a wise decision it was because the next film \\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\\" and even it's direct continuation into \\"Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock\\" definitely blasted the first film out of the water.  Following the success of the third film, Paramount tapped director and star Leonard Nimoy to helm the fourth installment \\"Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home\\" which has been praised by many as being the best and most mainstream of all the 'Star Trek' films.  Sadly, the success of the fourth film was not properly built upon with the 5th film \\"Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier\\". <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier\\" finds the crew of the Enterprise attempting a maiden voyage of a newly-christened starship Enterprise, but things go poorly and Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and his crew opt to put the ship back into spacedock until all the bugs can be fixed.  But before the repairs can be completed an urgent mission arises when a renegade Vulcan named Sybok begins kidnapping Federation officials in his quest for the supreme source of all creation, God.  So with the Federation in jeopardy, Kirk, Spock (Leonard Nimoy), and company must take the Enterprise with all her problems and attempt to stop Sybok before a galaxy wide conflict emerges between the Klingons and the Federation. <br /> <br />There are many factors that I believe led to the failure of this movie, and almost led to the demise of the franchise.  Firstly, William Shatner should not have been allowed to direct the film, he only was allowed to because he worked it into his contract, a mistake that Paramount more than likely regrets.  But, Shatner isn't completely to blame, the writing for this film was much weaker than its predecessors, this was in part because Nicholas Meyer, who had co-written the majority of the previous films with Harve Bennett was unavailable and a new writer was brought on board.  The story, based on a concept by Harve Bennett and William Shatner, held great potential for success or blasphemy depending on where they chose to take the story.  Instead neither was accomplished and the film felt choppy and uneven throughout.  The intention of the film according to Walter Koenig (who plays Pavel Chekov) was to find the same humor and adventure that had made the previous films, particularly \\"Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home\\", so great and mix in an important and meaningful message that would cause viewers to think more.  Sadly this too was unaccomplished, and the overall movie was lackluster and the series did suffer for it.  But, there are three good things I can say about this movie, one is that no matter how bad this movie was it still wasn't nearly as horrible as \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\"; and second, thank God that Paramount still had faith in the franchise to continue forward with more installments in the coming years; and third, it's a good thing that either Shatner or someone else realized he wasn't the right choice to direct any further installments and made sure something like this didn't happen again. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier\\" isn't the worst movie in the franchise, but it's pretty close.  Unevenly paced and failing to present any spark of interest in such a heavy topic, this movie could easily be passed over in most people's collections of'Star Trek' films.  But if you're a collector, I'm sure you've got this film and probably don't watch it that often, only when you feel the need to be a purist and see the entire series from start to finish or when you're in the mood for something easy to make fun of.  If you enjoyed the previous films and were interested in seeing this one, my advice would be to avoid it and go on to the sixth film, but if you want to see all of the 'Star Trek' movies then give this one a shot, who knows, you may disagree with me, I'm sure it wouldn't be the first time. <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier\\" is rated PG for violence and language.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Train of Thought, Dream Theater's seventh album, is also their heaviest, even heavier than 1994's Awake.  It's also their least melodic album in terms of songwriting, but that's not necessarily a bad thing here.  There are seven songs, and with the exception of two of them (Vacant, 3 minutes, and As I Am, 7 minutes), are all between 10 and 15 minutes long.  As I Am opens the album up with a concise blast of metal.  This Dying Soul is one of the heaviest songs DT has ever committed to disc, comprising part 2 of Mike Portnoy's AA suite.  Honor Thy Father is another brutal blast of metal, and Endless Sacrifice begins really hauntingly and beautifully before bludgeoning you over the head.  Vacant is 3 minutes of melancholy beauty, Stream of Conciousness is 11 minutes of instrumental wizardry...sort of their version of La Villa Strangiato (Rush's classic instrumental).  The album closes with the eerie and heavy In the Name of God.   <br /> <br />Throughout the entire disc, the band's instrumental wizardy is shown in full force.  Mike Portnoy shows his amazing drum chops, and John Petrucci really takes over on this disc with some of the sickest shredding and soloing I've ever heard.  John Myung and Jordan Rudess flex their muscles underneath it all, showing why DT has been considered one of the most fantastic instrumental bands ever.  And James LaBrie's vocals go from plaintive and emotive to sneering and snarling, often all in the same song.  I never understood why so many DT fans dislike his voice...he's just as good as the other 4 guys. <br /> <br />While this album has divided DT fans, if you're a fan of DT, metal, or just great prog, this would be an awesome album to check out!
B00004XQP4|5.0|By far Green Day's most unfairly received album, and by far their best. American Idiot is a great listen, and it is a great album, but there is only so much of it that you can take (well at least that is the case for me). This cd is by and large Green Day at their most revealing and honest. It seems with this cd, the guys faced the fact that they were grown men, and so they decided to get rid of the youthful punk attitude, and play music that cannot be restricted to a label. One could call this music an example of folk-rock, but the album the rocks too hard for that. One could also say that it's a rock cd, but it doesn't rock hard enough for that either. I consider this music to just be what it is, Green Day. This is music that is the result of fearlessness and just not giving a damn what the mainstream thinks. And unsurprisingly, it's Green Day's lowest selling album yet.  <br /> <br />The main influence on this music is crystal clear, Bob Dylan. Billie Joe's lyrics take on societal issues similarly to the way that Dylan hit the world like a slap on the face back in the early sixties with his protest songs like \\"Masters Of War\\" and \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carol\\". This is seen in slams against the establishment like \\"Warning\\" and \\"Minority\\", and also in the slice-of-life \\"Macy's Day Parade\\".  Billie even gives a nod to Bob with a harmonica solo in \\"Hold On\\". Yet Billie and gang still retain that same energy that drove them on their punk masterstroke Dookie, as seen in the songs \\"Jackass\\" \\"Church On Sunday\\", and \\"Deadbeat Holiday\\".  <br /> <br />The album seems to critique the main issues of society as seen from the perspective of the twentysomething working man, fresh out of wild partying and studying at college or university, practically having to beg, borrow, or steal to pay the bills, let alone having a social life. It's the little things in life that are the focus of these people, from trying to hold a relationship in \\"Church On Sunday\\", being a tool for the mainstream culture in \\"Fashion Victim\\", the loneliness of a work all day, sleep all night life in \\"Castaway\\", and the boring mundane of life as they know it in \\"Misery\\".  <br /> <br />This cd is all about the little things, and so, an equally subtle sound is given to it to enhance the feelings portrayed in the music. It may take you a few listens to appreciate this one, as it did for me, but once you see it for what it is, than you'll definitely come back to it again and again. With this cd, Green Day move from teenage angst and pure uncontrollable attitude, to the hard, mundane day to day life of a young adult overloaded with responsibility and bills to pay, and just trying to get by, living without warning.
B000000OR9|2.0|Blue Murder were John Sykes (vox/G), Tony Franklin + Carmine Appice and were, in essence, a project put together to take advantage of the short term high profile Sykes had after his association with David Coverdales Whitesnake. Backed by the seemingly unstoppable (at the time) Geffen, produced by Bob Rock and with John Kalodner lurking around this album had just about everything going fot it. Or so it would have seemed. Problems were present however and in point form they can be summarised as;<br /><br />A)An annoying treble heavy mix that's distracting to the listener on an average stereo and downright painful via headphones. Author Martin Popoff described the knob job here as 'often cluttered and opaque sounding'<br /><br />B) Overly long songs. Some of the tunes - such as the rather grand Valley of the Kings - have a sort of laborious pounding quality which really works. On others it just doesn't gel properly. The songs would have been fairly average at four minutes long. Dragging them out further is just cruel.<br /><br />Now it must be said that students of early Whitesnake may get more out of this. They tend to hero-worship Sykes - and lets face it his playing ability is darn fine - and they therefore may be more indulgent towards this disc. And his singing is interesting. Not overly gymnastic but it works well within the hard rock idiom the band operate in here. So there is interest here for some. For the general hard rock/metal fan there isn't a lot here to get excited about.<br /><br />Oh, and just as an aside since I quoted his review earlier, Martin Popoff gave this album a respectable 7/10 score. If have stars were permissible I'd grant 2.5 - so in direct comparison that'd make this a 5/10 in my book.
B000000W8C|5.0|Rumored to have been written, recorded, and produced under the influence of ecstacy, this album is by far one of the most haunting listens of the mid-90s, and one of the best. Richard Ashcroft and his cronies with this album crafted a challenging and incredibly rewarding listen, that will have you coming back to it again and again. As with any band that chooses to craft music characterized as subtle, as opposed to those that lay it all out there, this album demands repeated listens before you can see it for what it really is.  <br /> <br />Perhaps one of the darkest albums of the mid-90s in texture and content, this album sends you into the middle of a psychedelic freak-out storm at sea and doesn't let up until it's over. On first listen, any expectations of The Verve you might have formed after hearing \\"Birttersweet Symphony\\", will be blown away, and you'll be left wondering if A Northern Soul is the worst album you've ever heard, or the best, or maybe somewhere inbetween. You could imagine that this is a tough album to pin down and examine, since so much of it flies overhead in the first few listens. One day though, something clicks, and then it all makes sense.  <br /> <br />\\"New Decade\\" and \\"This Is Music\\" kick things off into high gear, signalling what's to come. Loud yet soft guitars, hypnotic grooves and rhythms, uncharted and unchartable song structures, and Richard Ashcroft's abyss of angst-ridden lyrics, with sneering delivery. What follows jumps between the two extremes of hypnotic bass driven bluesy numbers \\"Life's An Ocean\\" and \\"Take You Home\\", to the other extreme of total psychedelic storms \\"Brainstorm Interlude\\" \\"A Northern Soul\\".  <br /> <br />This album is a voyage into an endless well of angst brought on by loneliness and drugs, and that angst is displayed in an epic scope that easilly rivals that of Layne Staley and his own drug-fueled demons on the album \\"Dirt\\". Thankfully there is some kind of resolution to it however, encapsulated in the song\\"Sotrm Clouds\\", where Ashcroft tells us his story of \\"how his life seemed to change in a matter of days\\" asking \\"Why does change always seem to bring the rain?\\". If weren't for the resolution on this disc, it would be the next In Utero, perhaps the most alienating experience in music as we know it. A Northern Soul is a well-rounded, epic listen, one that anyone who has ever been plagued by angst can relate to, and even learn from. It's an enlightening listen.  <br /> <br />If you are looking for a challenging and rewarding listen, as well as brutally honest emotional rock music, as opposed to radio-ready mainstream music of the present, I can only ask you why you don't have this cd already?
B00006JKOL|4.0|- Play the first \\"rocking\\" track last as it is out of sync with the other folkish accoustic track, ala Heavy Horses or A Little Lite Music. <br /> <br />- If you own the orignal cd, don't by this one for the remastered sound, or the extra tracks, unless you have e.g. $5000 stereo system, you won't hear the difference, and the extra tracks don't justify a repurchase for 10 extra minutes(unless your rich enough and own the $5000 system), especially since the live ones are just snippets. <br /> <br />- If you own the lp, buy the cd as you will notice the improvement of cd sound over lp sound, with the clarity and extra treble. <br /> <br />The remastered cd includes a reprint of the original lp, reprint of more legible lyrics and a note from Ian Anderson. <br /> <br />That said, the material is not as good as Heavy Horses, basically an average to above average JT recording, worth 4 stars
B00008BXJ6|5.0|Let me start by saying this album is an AC/DC masterpiece. Definitely one of the best by them. Me being an AC/DC fanatic, I love this album. I will rate each song on a scale of 1 to 10.    1. It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock 'N' Roll)- This songs is catchy and a good all-around song. The only thing I don't really like is the repetitive bagpipes. 8/10    2. Rock 'N' Roll Singer- This song is pretty good, a good rocker, but gets a little repetitive. 7/10    3. The Jack- Definitely a great song. Angus does a terrific job of keeping the bluesy feel throughout it. 9/10    4. Live Wire- Kind of like \\"Rock 'N' Roll Singer\\", catchy, but a little repetitive. I like the bass riff in the beginning though. 7/10    5. T.N.T.- Terrific song, thats adored by AC/DC fans everywhere. A definite classic. 9/10    6. Can I Sit Next To You Girl- One of my personal favorites, because of the upbeat riff in the beginning. Awesome. 10/10    7. Little Lover- Pretty good song, I love the beginning, but the chorus is so-so. 9/10    8. She's Got Balls- Okay song, same vein as \\"Little Lover\\", but not as good. The only song I don't really care for on this album. 6/10    9. High Voltage- Obviously a great song, and a great way to end a great album. 9/10     So if you are a AC/DC fan, or if you only like a select few of their songs, you should buy this album. For only $10, it could change your whole view of rock 'n' roll.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|Ok, aside from the random ignorant reviewer who gives this album a poor review for reasons i still cant understand, I think we can all agree that they have done something very special here, and if I trust my foresight, I think in ten years this album will be alot like one such as BSSM in that it will still be thoroughly and often listened to, and a sentiment at that. The only component missing in this album being a classic is time and sentimentality, and in ten years those of us who already get it will have our opinions solidified and others who don't get it probably will with some time.  <br /> <br />After much listening, I'll comment on my top ten favorite moments on this album...  <br /> <br />1) The last chorus in She's Only 18. The storm sirens in the background make this the most urgent and pounding 20 seconds on the album.  <br /> <br />2) The beginning of Readymade, climaxing with the introduction of the first sound of the drums and the WOAHHHHHHHH. Pure liquid energy at its best when played at a very high volume. Oh, and the rest of this song too.  <br /> <br />3) 3:16-3:40 on Wet Sand. A total explosion beginning with the final chorus.  <br /> <br />4) The verse in the middle of She Looks to Me starting with \\"Down in the South Seas\\".  <br /> <br />5) Dirty baby time you're gonna take some  <br />Pretty baby love you're make some  <br />Little lady hearts you're gonna break some  <br />Kinda shady tears you're gonna fake some  <br /> <br />6) The chorus of Especially in Michigan, particularly the chanting in unison.  <br /> <br />7) The short but sweet guitar solo in Stadium Arcadium.  <br /> <br />8) \\"There's a reason for the 21st century, not too sure but I know its meant to be\\". Not sure why but i think this is my favorite single line on the album for being so well sung.  <br /> <br />9) The verse in Tell Me Baby starting with \\"Chitty chitty baby  <br />When your nose is in the nitty gritty\\"-- just because it takes me right back to BSSM every time I hearit.  <br /> <br />10) Death of a Martian as the best closer of any Chili Peppers album. \\"The nova..
B000BRBA8S|5.0|I don't usually like romance films, but 2046 is brilliant!   <br /> <br />A mind trip AND sensual candy! <br /> <br />If you have a short attention span, you will not appreciate this work of art.  But if the first half draws you in, the second half will BLOW YOUR MIND! <br /> <br />Wong Kar Wai sets up analogies between the relationships of each character.  By comparing characters in this way, we are given infinite perspectives on the characters and their emotions. <br /> <br />This is genius! <br /> <br />This is art! <br /> <br />Full of colorful symbolism!
B00005KHJM|5.0|This film has a very interesting plot, It is not only captivating from the beginning, it holds you throughout.<br /><br />It is about a small village on a secluded Island, where it's inhabitants live ( by choice) in times gone by.They are a strange \\"religious\\" cult, that believe in the ancient ritual of human sacrifice, and the entire movie grabs hold of you and takes you on the inside of this strange and very different way of life.<br /><br />A young girl goes missing, and the police believe her to be on this Island, and although all that live there deny she is there, he stays on to investigate.<br />The more he learns, the more he believes they are hiding her,<br />and without giving too much away, He discovers a plan of thiers that boggles the mind.<br /><br />It is NOT your typical horror film, and that is why I believe some were so dissapointed by it.It is more like a very creepy mystery that unravels in a very unexpected way, and the ending will just blow you away.<br />Also, the scenery in this movie is breathtakingly beautiful.
B0000A4GAK|4.0|I read most of the reviews and the words 'jam band' crop up way too often.  And to try to pigeon hole this stuff as jazz/fusion/southern rock doesn't do it justice.  \\"Derek should use his fingers to play\\".  Believe me, he uses his fingers!  He's obviously 'cut the umbilical' to Warren and the ABB.  He stays with them because he loves it.  I believe he can play/sit in with anybody.  To say it's 'courageous' is not quite accurate either, since the ABB has fooled around with Soul Serenade quite a bit; not to mention some jazz licks, etc.   Words that come to mind when I listen to this album: range, eclectic, inventive, stretching, synthesis, experimental.  I listen to it and imagine this may be very similar to what Duane would have done.  My only concern is that Derek throws in licks from Mountain Jam a little too often.  The ensemble is tight and this CD has a laid back feel.  A righteous effort.  A definite 'buy' rating.
B00004XQP4|3.0|Warning and Minority are the two greatest on the WARNING CD. <br />Buy it but don't listen to the morons below me and his recommendations. Green day isn't PUNK......they are hard rock! <br />3 stars. <br />
B000FFJ85I|3.0|Sing the Sorrow established itself with such strength and conviction in the emotion and feeling throughout the entire album. It's no wonder that despite starting off in the punk scene of the SF bay area, AFI still got such a huge overall positive response from fans and new listeners alike.<br /><br />December Underground however, while sharing a similar way of expression with sing the sorrow, comes off as very weak to me. I just gave it my first listen through, and I am thoroughly unimpressed.<br /><br />The album's featured track, 'miss murder', sounds so much like like current Green Day songs that in my opinion, record label management's marketing influence on the album couldn't be more apparent unless the CD came with a small bottle of water and a funnel, courtesy of interscope records. This way, you too could do your part in helping to water down AFI's personal creativity and make it more easily digestible to the masses. Or perhaps a free piece of fine sandpaper, so you could attempt to polish the band down to whatever image you think will be most acceptable to retail sotrefronts.<br /><br />Now, i'd like to clarify that I am certainly not trolling the band here. I'm not one to throw around the term 'sell-out' just because a band gains access to better overall production by doing what they can to accomodate thier record labels.<br /><br />It's been a while since thier last album, yet this one feels like it was put out in a rush, in the hopes of capitalizing on the enthusiasm for thier previous album. Part of this is my fault for not noticing the bunnies prancing around in circles around the band logo on the front cover. A more prominent warning of musical fluff could not have been attempted.<br /><br />I beleive I would have been more accepting of this album, if they had intended to release it as more of an appeasement EP until a better quality full length album would be available for release. Many bands have done that, and as long as you're honest about the album being what it is, I don't have a problem with it.<br /><br />So for now, I will just wait and hope that the album grows on me slowly over time. In the mean time, I'll be awaiting slayer's new release. At least with them you always know to expect a solid attempt at an album.eing what it is, I don't have a problem with it. <br />So for now, I will just wait and hope that the album grows on me slowly over time. In the mean time, I'll be awaiting slayer's new release. At least with them you always know to expect a solid attempt at an album.
B0002OERI0|3.0|This is still good. But I got really really tired of American Idiot. So now I'll give it 3 stars. The guitar is simple but Billie Joe is a great singer. The best song on it is probably <br />Holiday as it is. I still recommend get Warning, or any Dire <br />Straits, or Foreigner CD first. This is good but not great.
B000002MY3|5.0|Like a blast of cold air in the middle of a stifling hot room, so is Canadian-raised singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette's ground-breaking album.  Jagged Little Pill is the epitome of everything a rock record should be: hard, listenable and, most importantly, marketable to the masses.  From the opening track in which Morissette declares \\"All I Really Want\\" to the blisteringly explicit \\"You Oughta Know,\\" this chick makes a listener really listen.  Her intriguing and unique instrument cuts through all the typical froo-froo bells and whistles heard in the day by then-chart rulers Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, giving radio a new voice that is both expressionistic and genuine; this woman has been hurt by men and she's going to let you know how much, man!  Whether you've fallen \\"Head Over Feet,\\" think things \\"Ironic\\" or just need to be \\"Forgiven,\\" Jagged Little Pill is a pill everyone should swallow.
1582405956|3.0|I haven't looked through Frank Cho's comic books enough to really say if I like them or not, but I have seen examples of his work here and there and decided a book focusing on anatomy would be useful to me. (since that is a weak point in my art) I was somewhat disappointed when I received the book to find out that it contained only black and white illustrations. The beautiful cover is the only color throughout the book as well as the only painting. The best part I found were the comparisons between original graphite drawings and more finalized inks of some illustrations, there just were not enough like that.<br /><br />Basically, it's nice, but I'd like to see more color and more mediums.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|Like a glass of cold lemondade on a blistering afternoon, England's new R&B sensation Corinne Bailey Rae's self-titled debut album feels about the same.  Its first single, the mellow \\"Put Your Records On,\\" is a light, airy and laidback track reminiscent of a brisk-and-breezy morning walk in the woods, and deserves all the praise it has received since release.  \\"Trouble Sleeping\\" is nearly as likable as \\"Records,\\" but darker than its predecessor.  Rae's singing is at best likable and intriguing, unique enough to stand out from today's nasally Hilary Duff-ers, but nothing as intriguing as, perhaps, Macy Gray or as magnificent as Mariah Carey; it's listenable, without all the bells and whistles heard in a Carey-type voice.  \\"Call Me When You Get This\\" blends retro funk and soul elements into the mix, making it one of the record's most interesting listens.  Corinne Bailey Rae did good here, but probably more enticing than what this album possesses is how much better she can get.
1400032717|3.0|This was a nice, cutesy read, but having just finished Jonathan Safron Foer's EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, I felt that this novel paled in comparison.  If you enjoyed CURIOUS INCIDENT, you should check out Foer's novel.  Very similar but with finer form and sharper humor.
0195067142|5.0|This book was required reading for a class, and I am glad that it was. Gripping, vivid, detailed accounts told in an anecdotal style that pull the reader into the story of what it was really like to be at Peleliu and Okinawa.<br /><br />For those interested in battle tactics, equiptment and military strategy, this book may not be the best choice. While there is some mention of necessary details, the real meat of this memoir are the descriptions of day-to-day life: conversations with fellow Marines; witnessing acts of heroism, bravery and sometimes stupidity or carelessness; the moments of nerve-racking waiting before battle; the sights, sounds and smells of being on the front line.<br /><br />This is a must-read for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the Pacific battles of WWII. As a student, I hate to admit that I normally skim through material, taking note only of important points. But I read this book cover to cover, and then read it a second time.<br /><br />Fantastic!
B000FGGE68|4.0|People have to understand that this movie seems to revolve around the concept of the \\"Japanese Anime\\" culture. In almost every anime-based show and movie, you see some (if not all) of the following: <br /> <br />1. Over-the-top, clitche bad buys who are in charge. <br />2. Sword fights and/or fist fights. <br />3. Tacky costumes worn by the main characters. <br />4. Verbose comments. <br /> <br />The anime concept is completely different than the hollywood concept because the hollywood concept is built for a dumb audience while the anime concept is built for an intelligent audience who have an understanding of Japanese culture. And because I have this understanding, I was able to enjoy the movie Ultraviolet. Besides, as a man with common sense, I just watch the movie as if it was any other movie and enjoy it. I don't tear a movie up like most Americans (who don't have a life and nothing better to do) do nowadays. <br /> <br />All in all, I love this movie because it seems to have that anime feel to it. If you don't like anime, then tough luck. Put up with it. Criticizing won't fix the movie and the producers can do as they please because it is \\"their\\" movie made with their \\"own\\" money.
B000FFJ85I|2.0|When I saw the Miss Murder video for the first time I didnt catch the band's name at the beginning and stared at the tv screen with my head cocked with an eyebrow raised thinking, hmm.. That guy kind of looks like Davey. Whoa. that looks like Adam, too. By the time It was over I was convinced someone was trying to sound like AFI. I was pissed. . . but not as pissed as when I found out it WAS AFI. lol.     AFI sure has changed a lot since I joined 5th Column a few years ago. . . Sure, people used to label them, but how can Davey think that this new sound is going to free them from labels? I thought Davey was all \\"anti-label man\\" anyways. The sound IS a bit more mainstream, not to be harsh... maybe its leading to something better in the future? I hope so... Miss Murder has a little of the partial emocore we all loved about AFI, but It just doesnt make me like the song any more than I like something by Green Day or My Chemical Romance.     When I looked up the CD on Amazon.com, I was embarrased to see that people who bought this CD also bought a cd by Panic! At The Disco, whom are the epitome of everything I hate about the music industry.     Answer That and Stay Fashionable will permanently stay in my CD player, although this new [...], out the window. This isn't what I ordered. Take it back. lol. I'll wait for something suitable, or switch restraunts.   *shrug
B00000JCB2|1.0|WTH is wrong with Amazon lately. I tried to post 4 reviews and none of them was posted. Also I couldn't see where I got helpful/non-helpful votes. Also I'm starting to get sick of removing reviews for writing improper words. So someone wrote F + U + C + K or C + R + A + P or A + S + S, its not a nuclear assault on Washington for godsake!!    Anyway I'm not really gonna review this. I just wanted that someone will see this note so I've decided to take this pile of junk as a victim. No words can describe how horrible it is. And to believe it's not even Limp's worst. Everybody knows Limp Bizkit sucks, I'll just be wasting my time reviewing this.     Hit \\"YES\\" if you agree that Limp Bizkit sucks, otherwise hit \\"NO\\".
B00005JOVH|5.0|They say that third movie in a trilogy is usually the worst.  It's not the case here.  I had faith that Bret Ratner would craft an intelligent and fun movie to watch.  It isn't exactly faithful to the comics, but what it is faithful to is the spirit of the comics.  THe only complaints I really have is that Cyclops was taken out of the movie too early and one must wonder if his extremely limited role was due to Marsden's role in Superman Returns.  Apparantly there was alot of bad blood between the two studios over that.  Anyway, X-Men 3 is a good movie.  There have been some complaint over the dialogue but there are some real bad gems in the first two films too.  The whole Storm/Toad fight as well as Iceman telling his family that he's a mutant.  In such a dark movie, Ratner finds humor where it is appropriate.  It could have been a little longer but overall no complaints here.  By the way, it was interesting how Joss Whedon's storyline for AStonishing X-Men was utilized.
0385338694|3.0|Chick-lit, frothy and tender.<br /><br />This is a syrupy and silly kind of romance story, but there are some major issues with the message. Why is it that working women are portrayed as unhappy, unfulfilled and grey looking? The message that giving up your career for a country life of bread-baking just seems to be so old-fashioned, crazy, and simplistic; in times like ours, the latter is just unheard of.<br /><br />Kinsella's characters are whacky and over-the-top and this is a funny, entertaining read but it lacks a touch of deepness, mystery and passion.<br /><br />I also thought Kinsella missed a chance to tie up a lot of loose ends. She could have gone deeper into the development of her characters. She kind of leaves you on thin air.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game has become a staple in American Literature in the 20 years since it first came out.  If you don't believe me then head down to your local high school or junior high and you might be surprised that is often read amongst other titles by authors such as Shakespeare, Twain, Salinger, Homer and Harper Lee (7th - 9th grade English).  This may be somewhat surprising to some but not undeserving to most that have read it. <br /> <br />The plot has been mentioned in the 1000+ other reviews so I would rather examine what makes this book so good.  First, the main character of Ender is your classic underdog and he is an extremely identifiable character.  There is a little bit of Ender is all of us as he must battle the unjust and overcome extreme odds to succeed.  You root for him from the beginning, he succeeds on intelligence alone, and yet he is still flawed enough to be entirely too human.  His companions are just as loveable and fallible as him and have spawned their own separate books.  Second, the plot moves fast, is entirely unique, and is filled with action.  Card deftly handles the ingenious battle room sequences with skill in what would normally be very hard scenes to write clearly for most writers.  Finally, like all of the best science fiction, the book transcends it genre by having multiple identifiable and relevant themes running through the text.  It also appeals to teens since as stories about adolescence and identity often do. <br /> <br />Ender's Game is a Gen Y (and to some extent a Gen X) phenomenon.  From my experience, it ranks amongst these peoples favorite book more regularly then any other single book besides Catch 22.  (Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings as series seem just as popular but one can make an argument that no single book from those series is as good as Ender's Game)  It also seems to be one of those books that people who don't regularly read have picked up and loved. <br /> <br />In 1986 Ender's Game was immediately recognizedas gold by the Sci-Fi community.  The book won both the Hugo and Nebula award beating other popular books like The Postman and Footfall in what was a strong year for sci-fi in general. <br /> <br />Now is a better time then ever to pick up this book since the long awaited movie adaptation is prevalent in the near future.  A great book for young adults from 5th grade on and up as well.   <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  One of the few books that can really appeal to everyone.  Card's masterpiece with an overall level of quality that few others have been able to replicate.  Deserving of all its praise.
B000002JSN|5.0|\\"The human mind is simply unable to comprehend the dizzying magnitude of Led Zeppelins genius. It can't be done. It's like trying to comprehend the vastness of the Cosmos.\\"(see previous reviews)!!!!!    The Guy who wrote this has got to tone down his chemical consumption, a simple \\"Best Rock Album EVER\\" would have been enough. Those of us over 40(ish) who enjoyed this when it came out will now appreciate it's classic status 30 years later, when it's still being raved about. Albums of today can easily be listened to one song at a time.This one gets better the more tracks you play, and you feel cheated if you don't get to play it right through.    This album's magic is in the way that you are taken on a journey by Plant's vocals, and also by the fantastic riffs courtesy of Page & JPJ. Make no mistake, Bonzo is essential too, but his high points were on Dazed & Confused and Black Dog.    Anyone who is right into Zep 1 to 4, and want the same again, might be a little disappointed. This is adventurous music from a band not afraid to step outside the boundaries of the Metal genre, and it will expand your music appreciation.      For complete and utter vocal brlliance, Robert Plant is at his superb best. Jimmy & the 2 Johns are right up there with him! If  you want the Best of 70s Hard Rock, you only need two albums - The Runes and this!
B000046PVN|5.0|Superman:The Movie, was a movie that broke barriers in the effects department. It was a movie that broke, at the time, box office records. Not only did the movie do well but so did it's soundtrack however it was incomplete. It was sold as a 2 album LP but only a few stuff appeared. For years, movie buffs, historians, collectors were complaining because it wasn't the complete full length album. They were begging for the complete album. They signed a petition to Warner Brothers asking why and why did you jip us all these years?<br /><br />  So, after years of asking and writing in, Warner Brothers decided to finally give the fans what they want. A two disc edition was released and this IS the complete album. The one the fans wanted all along. Was it worth the wait? Yes as not only does this have every song featured in the film, it's also got extended tracks, unreleased, alternates, bonuses, a book explaining where each song fits in the film, and all the songs are in order.<br /><br /> Now, at the time, John Williams was fresh off Star Wars  and very much in demand (still is)and when he approached Superman, he wanted something that made you believe in him. He wanted a march. Something like a hero march. Believe it or not, he took his inspiration from Wagner and 2001: A Space Oddeysy. He took that theme and used it as the opening of the Superman theme. Listen carefully for it.<br /><br />  The Superman Theme is one of the most well known pieces of music and was nominated for original score. But I find that the most beautifuel piece on the whole album is The Flying Sequence (The Love Theme). As a bonus, it's featured without the words as well as a pop single. You'll notice the difference in it if you pay close attention. Another fun one is March of the Villians. It has a comedic feel to it which was purposley done as Otis was the \\"bumbling idiot\\" to Lex's straight man.<br /><br /> All in all, it's a great album that will go down as one of the greatest. One has to wonder though how it would have turned out had someone else scired it.ned out had someone else scired it.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|Tim Burton's 1989 megahit BATMAN was a fine film - very fine, in fact.  And though it is a very fine film, something about it just didn't seem right to me.  Having heard that 1992's BATMAN RETURNS was a good, but not great sequel, I watched the film with moderate expectations. <br /> <br />And I was completely blown away.  Friends, it seems to me that BATMAN RETURNS is not a good sequel - it's a fantastic sequel.  Perhaps it's because director Burton had more creative control over the film than he did on BATMAN.  Indeed, at times BATMAN RETURNS seems more like a Tim Burton movie than a Batman movie.  It's far darker than the 1989 film; Gotham is a city which seems to be shrouded in perpetual night and darkness.  Burton's BATMAN RETURNS, when compared to 1989's BATMAN or Christopher Nolan's BATMAN BEGINS, seems like a nightmarish adaptation of the Dark Knight's adventures.  The Penguin, played by Danny De Vito, is a truly grotesque creature, his mouth covered in some sort of black ooze, his obese body a sort of pale, olive green, his hair long and stringy.  Catwoman, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, is dressed in skin-tight leather and has razors at the ends of her claws.  This is a far darker Batman than Nolan's, Schumacher's, or even the Batman in Burton's 1989 film. <br /> <br />BATMAN RETURNS was the first superhero film to bring more than one comic book villain into the mix.  Nowadays, that's fairly common (Magneto and the Phoenix in X-MEN III, Venom and Sandman in SPIDER-MAN 3).  In the film, the deformed Penguin rises from the sewers of Gotham City and immediately gains the pity and support of the city's people; Batman (Michael Keaton), however, suspects that the Penguin has a hidden agenda.  Meanwhile, timid secretary Selina Kyle is resurrected from a brief death and becomes the violent and agile Catwoman.  While businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) plots to run Gotham with the help of the Penguin, the flippered fiend creates a scheme with Catwoman to destroy Batman once and for all.   <br /> <br />Though the cast of BATMAN was great - who could forget Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker? - the cast of BATMAN RETURNS is truly superb.  Keaton is at his finest; he has some great comedic interactions with Michael Gough as clever butler Alfred.  DeVito's Penguin is a truly repulsive character; he does a grand job.  And then there's Michelle Pfeiffer.  Pfeiffer is absolutely wonderful as Catwoman.  Her first meeting with Batman and the Penguin is just terrific.  Pfeiffer makes it clear how conflicted Selina Kyle is feeling - is she the timid secretary, the charming seductress, or the violent Catwoman?  The scenes with Keaton and Pfeiffer together are entrancing.  One of my favorite parts of the original Batman comics was the relationship between Selina Kyle/Catwoman and Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Burton handles it very well here. <br /> <br />Burton's directing is, as always, spectacular.  One of my favorite things about the Batman series is the different styles of each director.  I especially love Burton's nightmarish view of Gotham City.  This is some of Burton's finest work right here, captured beautifully by cinematographer Stefan Czapsky.  Danny Elfman delivers another wonderful score, one of his finest.  The beginning of the film, with gothic landscapes, Paul Reubens (yes, Pee-Wee Herman), stylish cinematography and eerie directing, is classic Burton. <br /> <br />BATMAN RETURNS surpassed my expectations in every possible way.  It's a stunning, mesmerizing, stylish, and surprisingly-underrated masterpiece, a visual spectacle, and in my eyes a considerable improvement over 1989's BATMAN.  This is Tim Burton, Michael Keaton, Michelle Pfeiffer, and most of all Batman at their absolute finest.  And the ending?  To die for.
B000EOTAM6|5.0|Fantastic Special Effects. Always good to watch Charlize. 007 is childplay compared to this!!!
B000BKDOCA|4.0|I don't have this collection.  However, I like a lot of the songs from it & I ABSOLUTELY love the new single, \\"And Then We Kiss\\".  It's awesome.  I have heard it only once outside of my house - it was played in a club.  It's seductive, it's techno, & it's just amazing!  I love Britney Spears...
B000002AE3|5.0|This is without a question one of the best Toto albums. I still have to try \\"Falling in between\\", which will be my next buy. But, it is a true gem, a very overlooked album. I only wish that instead of the commercial crap by pretty-looking youngsters with no real new musical offer we're hearing nowadays (many of which only last a couple of albums, if any), we could be getting music this good and with this same quality. The musicians surely are great... Luke is one of the best guitarists alive, period. Simon is great on the drums, just as Mike and Dave are with their respective gear. <br /> <br />Most of the sogs are truly great and just a couple of them are just OK. <br /> <br />Great work, Toto... keep it up!!!!

1400079179|3.0|Although books by John Sandford and Nelson DeMille sell by the zillions, Dan Brown has found a way to transcend the efforts of those superior writers to reach an even broader audience.  He takes a rather mundane potboiler plot and weaves into it a rich tapestry of \\"Wow, I never thought of that!\\" historical \\"facts\\" and implications that easily captured the minds of millions of readers who had never thought of purchasing a mystery-thriller.  While I was never really mystified by the clues, I still found myself eagerly following the unfolding of this yarn.  Reading it was a lot of fun.<br /><br />I think of it as a \\"My First Mystery\\" book, because few of the puzzles and tradecraft that the characters are involved in were new or verged on the un-obvious to anyone who already is immersed in this genre.  Indeed, it was almost mildly annoying to have Brown talking down to his readers to explain things that most people already know, such as (no real spoilers here): what do you do when you discover a GPS tracking device on your person? stumble across one of the most famous number sequences from high school math class, or are given hints to one of the most famous eulogies ever delivered. (The movie is actually better in this regard, because it doesn't waste a lot of time explaining some of the more technical details that Brown expounds on ad nauseum.)<br /><br />The plot's a grabber, the puzzles are either interesting (but not too hard) or amusing, depending on your experience with mysteries, and the whole Da Vinci/Priory of Sion/Grail thread rather engaging if you don't mistake it for fact.  The real weakness is in the characters, who are neither well-developed nor seemingly competent for the jobs they are expected to carry out.  Although most readers aren't linguists, I find it hard to believe that a college professor steeped in Grail lore would know so little French that he'd require a translation of such integral terminology as Sangreal/san greal/sang real.  My teenage son spotted this connection easily, just from his high school Spanish!<br /><br />In any case, I hope that those who were exposed to mystery novels for the first time will continue to explore this arena after they've finished Angels and Demons. As much fun as The Da Vinci Code was -- the genre gets even better when written by the masters.e son spotted this connection easily, just from his high school Spanish! <br /> <br />In any case, I hope that those who were exposed to mystery novels for the first time will continue to explore this arena after they've finished Angels and Demons.

B00006AW2G|4.0|Although I'd rate this as a good Stones album, it is not in the class of their preceding album 'Beggar's Banquet' (their best ever IMO) and 'Sticky Fingers', their second best.<br /><br />What let's down LIB are a couple of sub-standard tracks such as 'Monkey Man', which is a pretty poor effort by the Stones, considering they were producing their greatest work around this period. The other duff track is the obvious filler 'Country Honk', which is a rather inferior re-worked version of 'Honky Tonk' Woman, their famous single released at the time.<br /><br />There are 2 true classic tracks on the album; the soulful 'Gimme Shelter' and the brilliant closing number 'You Can't Always Get What You Want', the edited version was the B side to 'Honky Tonk Woman. 'Midnight Rambler' is a good blues jam, but was done much better live than in the studio (listen to 'Get Yer Ya-Yas Out.) The remainder of the tracks are ok, with 'Love in Vain' lending a nice bluesey feel to the album.<br /><br />So a rather good Stones album overall, but really, not that great.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|\\"Fun House\\" grooves with an unholy mixture of sex, violence, and hard drugs. With only the main riffs written out before hand by Iggy, the band viciously jams behind their unstable frontman; willingly following him into the mad depths of the abyss and beyond. When he's not howling and screeching like a wild animal, Iggy often croons the mostly ad-libed vocals with sneering meanace. His performance creates the impression of a desperate man that's a danger to himself and those around him, someone who's struggling to maintain control of his most primitive sexual and violent impulses(not far from the truth actually). This isn't completely the Iggy show either as the Stooges do the seemingly impossible by keeping it natural and chaotic without sacrificing the tightness of the groove.     The A side features the shorter more accessible tracks. \\"Down on the Street\\" lurches with a guitar crunch that resembles a conveyor belt feeding the listener into a chomping steel crusher, while \\"Loose\\" halts the spinning chainsaw guitar just long enough for Iggy to calmly make the suggestive threat,\\"I'll stick it deep inside.\\" The side's climax,\\"T.V. Eye,\\" begins with one of all time great howls before it eventually descends into un-intelligble babble and screams before returning to the addictive lead riff. The bluesy ballad \\"Dirt\\" closes the half on a clam note but it's clear the band is far from finished.     The B-Side is much more Avant Garde with a Free Jazz Saxophone being added to the mix for the hell of it. \\"1970\\" is the most urgent exhausting track on the album with the band performing like it's the last song their ever going to play, you can literally feel the sweat, slobber and blood spewing at you. The circus tinged title track follows the climax with a weary jam in which the band appropriatley sounds like a spent force running low on steam. However it's just the calm before the meltdown that's \\"L.A. Blues.\\" The grooves that drove the album are completely dropped in favor ofall out chaos while Iggy rants, screams, and growls jibberish before the band reluctantly burns out and slips away. Not so much a song but the sound of some great dying beast going down fighting, fitting in that the whole album best works as a single organism as opposed to a collection of individual songs. The magic is in how the songs work together and build from one another. Nothing on here stands out as the best song the Stooges or Iggy Pop ever produced but when taking in as a whole it's their greatest towering achievement.     This isn't Rock N Roll at least as it's ever been known before this release but something else entirely. Violent Free Jazz and all out Avant Garde peformed by a somehow even more drug and sex crazed James Brown is probably the most accurate but even that goofy analogy fails to give this masterpiece justice. Don't forget the bonus disc which features alternative jams that rival the ones that made the final cut.  For more funky avant/rock madness check out: Can: Tago Mago and Tim Buckley: Starsalior.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Before Harry Potter, before the Lord of the Rings, before the slew of comic book movies like Spiderman, X-Men, etc... there were very few good fantasy movies that were not sci-fi.  One could probably count them on one hand; Legend, The Dark Crystal, Dragonslayer, and this impressive family movie by George Lucas: Willow.  Named after the central character of the movie - Willow Ufgood, this movie follows his adventures across a mystical, wooded land of monsters, trolls, magic, dwarfs, midgets, an evil queen, and great swordplay.  Willow's children encounter a baby of another race.  Their village council sends Willow to return the baby to its rightful owner.  Along the way he encounters fairies, a witch, a great swordsman, a two-headed monster and all sorts of wonders that inhabit his magical world.  He also discovers that the baby he is escorting is destined for greatness, and he picks up an assortment of friends, allies and enemies along his journey. <br /> <br />The movie clocks in at about 2 hours and makes for a relaxing, entertaining story that is appropriate for anyone but the smallest kids.  It has romance, action, adventure, drama, comedy and the ocassional scary scene thrown in for good measure.  The cinematography is beautiful.  Filmed in the British Isles and partially in New Zealand, one can see portents of the LOTR movies in some of the grand vistas.  The music is outstanding and perfect for a movie such as this; fans of George Lucas quickly hear his good ear in picking out the best thematic music for action-adventures such as this movie.  Last but not least, the swordplay is great; better I think than in any of the Star Wars movies, very authentic and realistic.   <br /> <br />All in all a great movie and I highly recommend it.
B000FA57RG|4.0|I'm Going To tell You A Secret is another documentary from the most successful female recording artist in history the one and only MADONNA. For anyone who has seen Madonna Truth or Dare (Blonde Ambition Tour 1990) you know how entertaining Madonna can be. If you are looking for a Truth or Dare part 2 you are going to be disappointed. This is Madonna 14 years later (Reinvention Tour 2004) and she is not pushing the boundaries of sexuality as she did in the early 90's. What Madonna is doing is what we all at one point in our lives or another do, and that is question the purpose of our lives and that we try to be better people. At times I do miss the early sexual in your face Madonna, but like Madonna me and many other fans have grown up and are older and we have different interests. There comes a point in your life when you start to look beyond the surface and want to know more about the big picture. I will be forever grateful that I was one of those kids that got to see and grow up with Madonna and watch her push all those boundaries and define the music and MTV era like no one before or since. Now days it is hard to find someone who is as daring, truthful, outspoken or original as she was and still is. What will separate Madonna from other stars is that she keeps going. She may be drug down in the dirt for releasing what some call a bad album or bad movie, yet she will bounce back and amaze the hell out of you with a record breaking album (Confessions on A Dance Floor hit #1 in over 40 countries) and release a tour that goes beyond what a tour is supposed to be by stimulating your mind and senses. She is human and like all of us she will have her ups and downs. What makes her a true artist is that she does what she wants and creates the art she wants, and you can either join her along for one amazing emotional journey or you can stay behind and watch. I'm Going To Tell You A Secret is a great documentary and it shows no matter how rich and famous you get there is more to life than just that.

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|This gorgeous film portrays a portion of Homer's Iliad, Achilles' story. Brad Pitt plays Achilles and brings to life this ancient warrior.  Despite no overt manifestation of the gods, Pitt manages to convey possession by the god of war or possesion by the warrior archetype in his body language and facial expression.  His intense physicalization of the role is typical of Pitt's talent and dedication to studying and learning a character.<br /><br />The crux of the matter is that Achilles is not a likeable character in the original.  He was a great warrior but he was childish and petulant.  In the movie they emphasize his lust for glory.  His pride and lack of impulse control exemplifies the dark side of the heroic which manifested in other great Greek heroes such as Hercules and Medea.  This heroic dark side is often ignored in modern heroic portrayal and leads to problems in our society.<br /><br />Pitt and Peterson did not flinch from portraying this darkness and in the process provided a portrait of the ugliness of war which I find psychologically useful in this modern era of war.  Achilles is balanced by the excellent and sympathetic portrayal of Hector by Eric Bana.  Continuing the theme of the problematic nature of war is the portrayal of Agammenon as a cynical warmonger who manipulates others in order to achieve his goal of hegemony.<br /><br />Of note is the wonderful acting performance in the portrayal of King Priam by O'Toole. One of the best scenes of the movie is where Priam goes to Achilles to beg for the body of his son.  The interaction/chemistry between the two actors was savory.  Both Pitt and O'Toole clearly have studied Homer's version and provide a poignant scene which underscores the tragedy of war.<br /><br />While this movie departs from the original I find it to be a satisfying and beautiful modernization of the story--certainly there is nothing to compare it to since nothing quite like this has been attempted in film.  My only complaint might be that I would have liked an attempt to portray the gods.  But perhaps the absence of gods is apt in our literal modern age where nature is de-sacralized and we put the gods in the service of our wars.an attempt to portray the gods.

B00005JNEI|5.0|This documentary is excellent. All of the people who have been critiquing this film, are no doubt conservative, but are also immature, misinformed, and can only bury their heads in the sand, rather than accept the truth. I am sick of reading reviews where people say that he only shows one side of the story and that the documentary isn't true. Moore does a great job of having backed every single thing he says up with solid evidence. You cannot deny evidence. And all of the scenes it shows of Bush? Like one reviewer said, Moore didn't hire some guy to dress up as President Bush and act retarded. Moore didn't hire actors to play army recruiters and politicians. Everything in his film is 100% authentic. And how can he show the other side of the story? There is no logic argument against the facts that Moore portrays. Do people think he is making this stuff up? Again, everything said is backed by evidance. How could people not be sad by watching a woman make a trip to Washington DC after her son was killed in an unnecessary war, and then having the door slammed in her face? That should even make a conservative sad- and if it doesn't, than you are completely heartless and have absolutely no sympathy. I am sick of hearing right-winged idiots talk about how military personell and veterans \\"know the truth and support our country and think Moore is a liar\\" whenever there is an entire book \\"Will They Ever Trust Us Again?\\" SPECIFICALLY with letters from people in the military and veterans praising Moore. If you want the truth, you need to watch this documentary.
B00000K2W1|4.0|I never saw Janis perform in person; however, anyone can see her perform live because there is an excellent video: Janis: The Way She Was. This includes three different renditions of \\"Ball and Chain\\". She left Mamma Cass in shock at the Monterrey Pop Festival. My advice is that people skip the recordings and go straight to the video. Janis was much more than a singer; she was a cultural icon. A recording of Janis is like a recording of opera - incomplete.
B0007GADZO|5.0|After seeing the reviews above I feel a fair review is overdue. <br /> <br />My first thought on hearing this album was \\"what a chaotic mess of soundscapes!\\". But there lurked charm enough to keep me returning to it, one song at a time. Perhaps the greatest problem with it is that there are no bad or weak songs on this disk. Every track vastly different in musical terms, but the overall theme is like a series of moods/moments extracted form your souls long journey. <br /> <br />It took me not just days, but over two weeks of random track listens to get my head around it, now its by far my fave Vai disc. The performance is nothing short of viruosity, there is no-one who can shred like steve. Each song showcases a different aspect of this artists unbelievable talent, not just as a guitarist but as a composer. The melodies are hauntig. The layering leaves you discovering new sounds and noises even months after the first listen. The chord progressions complex and profound. The extremely diverse choice of sounds ensures that when you get to the end of it you are left craving for more. <br /> <br />The lack of boring and \\"idle\\" musical moments means that this is music for intelligent ears. Its far to intense to be left playing in the background. It's in your face and will consume every moment of your attention from start to finish. <br /> <br />The passion and cleverness of this work is not obvious at first but it will grow on you to the point of becoming addictive. Take your time, maybe listen to one song at a time. Eventually the puzzle will come together for a totally uplifting and inspiring listening experience.
B000002BBY|5.0|As being the biggest Oasis fan in the world, now looking back 11 years after this masterpiece was made, this in my opinion is one of the top ten albums ever made. Defitinatly Maybe was a true rock album, the loudest sound from England since \\" Never Mind The Bullocks\\" and \\" Be Here Now\\" was awesome as well in it's own right. This album was when Noel knew that he was the best songwriter in the world. He could do know wrong. They no longer wanted to be rock and roll stars, they were. \\"Wonderwall\\" <br />\\"Champagne Supernova\\" \\" Morning Glory\\" \\" Roll With It\\" are as good as any songs you will ever here. I have to say my favorite song is \\" Some Might Say\\" . Noel at this time was the king of rock. If you are lucky enough to buy the record, you will here an artifact \\"Bonehead's Bank Holiday\\" which is hidden. It was was sad to see Bonehead and Guigsy leave during the SOTSOG  <br />sessions and unfortunately Oasis has never been the same, although Don't Believe The Truth is showing that Noel, Liam as well as Bell, Archer are capable of making great music still. They recorded this album in the summer of 95 during the most exciting period in England's history since the sixties when the Beatles and Stones were rulers. Oasis is still my favorite band of all time. This album as well as \\"Definately Maybe\\" and \\"Be Here Now\\" only prove my point.
B000002J09|3.0|I hate LZ! But before a angery mob of fans hangs me, let me explain one thing, they \\"Might\\" be good I dnt know I listen 2 them and I myself didn't like them, but then I like punk rock AKA Nirvana,and Green Day, soo I really cnt say, they might be good at what they do. Such as I hate ALL Country music, so why would I assume 2 call it stupid? I am just rating this because I am sick and tired of idiotic LZ fans rating one star on Greenday Albums, THERE Totally differnt music you can't compare them! <br />As a recomdation, I say that everyone should listen to Poodle Hat from Weird Al. it's the funniest thing you have ever heard and some people need a bit of humor in there lives as angery as there reviews are!
B0002S64OG|4.0|I received this DVD as a gift from one of my co-workers, who swears by the series.  She guaranteed my son would love it.  We play it once a day, and without fail, he is really taken with the many colorful toys and happy music.  This was a really great gift.  Though, I have to say, even though the music in this one is better than most infant DVDs, it still is nice to have a variety as a mom.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I've never read anything by Jane Austen, and I suspect I never will. Thus I have no idea whether Joe Wright's version of Pride and Prejudice is an accurate translation of the novel to film. But I do know that it's one of the best films my wife and I have watched together in a long time. The film was like a breath of fresh air to me; I found something almost shocking about the culture of love and marriage the film depicts. As I watched the movie, I couldn't refrain from contrasting the drama of Victorian courtship with the oversexed, hypersensual culture of \\"courtship\\" (so-called) that characterizes today's young people.  <br /> <br />As for the merits of the film itself, Wright does a fantastic job of whittling down Austen's apparently complicated plot into a coherent narrative. The cinematography is striking as well. When the movie opened up with a slow, Malick-esque reveal of a sunrise over a stand of trees, I immediately knew there was something special going on. There is one shot at a ball where the camera goes from room to room, picking up conversations and characters as they move about, backtracking and picking them up again as they socialize and dramatize. I didn't count, but I think the shot was at least six to eight minutes long. This is a very difficult shot to accomplish, as multiple actors have to hit their lines and their positions in a very crowded area right on time, and if someone flubs their part, that's an eight-minute take that just went down the drain. This kind of shot is the mark of a patient and creative filmmaker.  <br /> <br />The largely British cast is also phenomenal. I usually consider Keira Knightley to be the queen of overacting, but here her personality is perfect for Lizzie Bennett. I've never heard of the actor playing Mr. Darcy, but I instantly knew I wanted to see him in other films. He has a weighty screen presence about him that's a joy to watch. My wife immediately declared Pride and Prejudice to be one of her favorite movies of all time, and as for love stories, I'd have to agree. It's not only good entertainment, it showcases a picture of love and romance that all young people would benefit from seeing, especially girls. We'll be showing it to our daughter when she enters the dating world as a counterbalance to the false messages about love and romance the world gives her. <br />
0765315246|4.0|Pretty much summarizes it in \\"high concept\\" terms. A good read, but be prepared to deal with an unreliable narrator and typical first-novel glitches. Reading between the lines, there's some pretty ominous things happening in the background, and it's clear that the gung-ho is hiding something bad. Hopefully we'll get more details in future stories in this series.
B000002WPI|5.0|I Highly recommend this cd to any person that is not into Hip-Hop.  Listen to all of the reviews given to this album.  After hearing the talent youll understand what the Hype is all about with Hip-Hop, and it will open the doors to a whole new style of music for any curious individual.  This cd is amazing and so are all of the true Emcees in this group.  Enough said.
B00005ATQH|3.0|I am still uncertain what I feel about Stanley Kubrick's film, Lolita. A very outdated film considered today's standards of love scenes between middle-aged men and the young girls they fall for. The film is in black and white, it's a great looking film, beautifully shot by Kubrick, I never read the book but hope to soon. Shelly Winters is wonderful and completely real as the mother of Lolita. She is so desperate to keep her writer hubby eyes away from her \\"precious\\" 16 year-old. Lolita is a very curious, manipulative, confused girl. I truly believe Lolita seduces Humbert and not the other way around. She uses her new-found sexuality to get what she wants, does she really desire Humbert or is this all a game to her? This film is a bit boring at times, dribbles on too long but Lolita is a classic so how can you argue with a classic.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Its been a long wait for the follow up to by the way, but its finally here, and i've had the opportunity to spend quite a bit of time with it. Stadium Arcadium is not as good as By The Way or Californication, nor is it as good as the band may have led us to believe with their comments preceeding the album's release. There is nothing as good as \\"californication\\" or \\"otherside\\" and nothing as melodic as \\"tear\\", but the band does a nice job of mixing up their styles. \\"Dani california\\" is catchy rock at its best and then \\"Snow (hey oh)\\" takes us back to the more melodic side of the spectrum. It's true that the album does have too many mid tempo tracks in a row, especially on \\"Jupiter\\", so the balladry of the title track, and rockers like \\"Torture me\\" provide refreshing twists. The first disc doesnt hit its peak until \\"especially in michigan\\" starts. Perhaps the catchiest song on either disc, the song rocks and is still as melodic as any other track on the album. Kiedis turns in an especially good vocal performence. It has been said that the lyrics on this track are nonsense, and its true most of it doesnt make much sense, even to a michiganian such as myself, but i do appreciate the reference to two of the states sports teams (lions and tigers). \\"C'mon girl\\" is the worst song on the entire album, with a chorus that shows no intelligence, talent, or innovation, however, the remainder of \\"Jupiter\\" is great, from the hooks of \\"warlocks\\",the slow building of \\"Wet sand\\" into a powerful climax, and the cool jazzy undertones on \\"Hey\\", one of the best songs ever to close out a chili peppers disc.    In my opinion, \\"Jupiter\\" is the better disc, but \\"mars\\" definately has its moments, and is probably more consistant than jupiter, with less mid tempo tracks. \\"21st century\\" rocks hard, but \\"Hard to concentrate\\" is one of the slowest songs the chili peppers have ever done, a ballad about marriage with great melodies. \\"Animal Bar\\" sounds great, with the verses and bridge sounding likesomething off of \\"By the way\\" and the chorus rocking out. Perhaps my favorite moment on \\"Mars\\" comes in \\"So Much I\\", a rocker. I love the chorus, which features some of the best vocal harmonies of the past decade (please dont turn away again/please dont turn me into them). Frusciante contributed a lot of such harmonies to the disc, but this one is the best, and definately makes this track the best from a singer's point of view. The rest of the disc is great, from the dark rock of \\"We believe\\" to the great lyrics and awesome spoken conclusion to \\"Death of a martian\\" another one of the best closers in the peppers' discography.    So is the album as good as \\"By the way\\" or \\"Californication\\"? No, and even though that means its the worst chili peppers album since \\"One Hot Minute\\" its still one of the best in their whole catalog. As is true with most double albums, this could have been condensed into one completely amazing disc, but unlike lesser bands (smashing pumpkins, i'm talking about you here) the chili peppers actually have the songs to merit a double album release...and yes its far better than the foo fighters double album a year ago. Everyone is bound to have at least one song they wont like, but they should just enjoy the fact that they just got 28 songs from the red hot chili peppers for the price of 12-14. Amazing album, and perhaps the best so far this year.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Not unlike their first album, I picked this one up on a whim.  I was pleasantly surprised.  While one could say that the first album was overly radio-ready, the same can't be said for the second.  That's not saying that they aren't going to have any more singles on the radio, though, but they clearly are more confident with their sound and the direction they want to go (as opposed to their label).  Its easy to relate to a lot of the lyrics and, in a rare turn, they simoutaneously seem deeply personal.  They're showing a lot more depth with this album, and while they're sound isn't particularly complicated, it achieves what it sets out to accomplish and with gusto.  Some of the stand-outs for me include the single \\"Animal I Have Become,\\" \\"Riot,\\" \\"Pain,\\" \\"Get Out Alive,\\" and \\"Never Too Late.\\"  Great album.
B000002AGY|5.0|Great interpretation of Concierto de Aranjuez.   I am not into jazz, but this interpretation of Aranjuez really  moves me.   Deserves 5 stars for this track.
B00000JSJC|4.0|STRANGE DAYS requires a little patience; it's first quarter is chaotic and doesn't seem to be taking us anywhere.  However, once its basic storyline takes focus, the movie turns out to be an entertaining if disturbing look at violence and man's destructive and obsessive tendencies.  It's the end of the 20th Century and the \\"drug\\" of choice is a virtual reality type of device that allows its user to experience not only the activities of someone else, but the emotions that person feels while experiencing it.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes plays a former vice squad cop who sells these tapes to people and finds himself involved in a murderous situation.  Angela Bassett is very good as Fiennes' driver and apparent lover whose moral code surpasses Fiennes and who refuses to experience these tapes.  Michael Wincott is a sleazy record producer and a sorely miscast Juliette Lewis is Fiennes' true love.  A long haired Tom Sizemore is Ralph's best friend and also a former cop.  Vincent D'Onofrio and William Fichtner have early roles as renegade cops who murder a controversial rap star.<br /><br />Director Kathryn Bigelow tries some interesting point of view camera shots but should have trimmed some of the excess fat; it might have made a much better movie.
0446607274|5.0|This 1999 book is a re-read for me. Can't remember all the details of a 7 year old book so it's as good as a new book for me. <br /> <br />Connelly, as usual, writes a very good crime book. It's not fast paced, it's not scary, but it's a very good police crime book. <br /> <br />Connelly's forte is writing realistic characters. I know all the protagonists, Bosch, Edgar, Kiz, Irvine and Chastain from previous books where he did a good job of bringing them to life.  <br /> <br />There is a very good depiction of how the LAPD and LA reacts to a very serious crime, very realistically written and almost worth the cost of the book itself. However, it might put off some of his audience...... <br /> <br />There is only minor subplot here, and some interesting stuff about the internet, but that's 7 years old. I didn't really like the subplot with Eleanor since this is a crime book, not a drama. I cringed when I read about Eleanor since I did not want to be reading 3-4 pages about something that had nothing to do with the plot. <br /> <br />The crime itself is very nicely plotted out. We are led along the leads and are right there as Bosche unravel the crime(s). Like I said, not very fast paced, but a very solid crime book. This was not a book I had to read til my eyelids dropped. I could put it down and do other stuff and get back to it, but still a very worthy addition to the Bosch collection. I don't want to give anything about the plot away so that's all I'll say about it.
B00004TH83|5.0|Lara Fabian's self-titled CD is just awesome.  I first heard it while meandering in a music store.  Fabian has a strong voice and the song selection highlights that talent along with her vocal range.  Despite being fluent in multiple languages, her songs in English show no signs of an accent.<br /><br />The songs are moving and thoughtful.  There seems to be sadness running throughout many of the songs, but all remain beautiful.  My favorite was 'A Broken Vow' which is accompanied by a powerful, but not overpowering, wall of sound.<br /><br />I have no cmplaints about this CD.  I just wish she would do more in English.
0307277674|2.0|The summary of the book goes thusly: puzzle presented...meaningless discussion...eureka!  Puzzle solved!  Ad infinitum.<br /><br />I expected much more out of this novel.  The characters are completely undeveloped, and not a single event was a surprise in the reading.  Poor, poor writing.<br /><br />That having been said, I did give two stars, because the suspense was kept high; a \\"page-turner\\" is the common colloquial expression.  I'll have to admit that I laughed out loud at some of the absurd \\"connections\\" in the book, however.<br /><br />As for the entire \\"Church as a monster\\" writ in the exposition of Teabing and Langdon, the shock value was definitely there, but especially by that time, it's hard to take anything written very seriously any more.  How perfectly, thoughout the book, any evidence supporting the Holy Blood/Holy Grail theory is endlessly repeated, and any counterevidence ruthlessly ignored.<br /><br />As a final insult, at each pause in the action, it looks like Brown visited Wikipedia and just summarized any information he saw there concerning the locale that he was about to discuss.  Some impeccable research.
B00028HBKM|5.0|An amazing telling of how the Savior of the World sacrificed Himself for all of humanity.Violence was a very real factor in the sufferings of Christ and through His sufferings we are able to receive eternal life through the shedding of His innocent blood.
B00005B36H|5.0|It makes me laugh when i see some Tool fans, or those who claim to be anyways, say that this album is not Tool and it's their worst effort. Are you kidding me?! \\"Lateralus\\" is the pinnacle of what music is supposed to be. No other album can offer up song after song of such brilliance it's almost laughable to think of any other album that comes close to.Even the so called filler songs or instrumentals like \\"Disposition\\" are a joy to listen to.It all starts off with \\"The Grudge\\" and just gets better and better.\\"The Patient\\" is, IMHO, Tool's best song yet. \\"Parabol\\" ,\\"Parabola\\" , and of course \\"Lateralis\\" are just other examples of this albums greatness. Words are hard to come up with when describing \\"Lateralus\\", it's just that good. Hopefully Tool will be able to top this album or at least come close one day, certainlly 10,000 Days did not quite do the trick, but at least Tool fans and just fans of great music in general will always have \\"Lateralus\\". 5 years later and still the best! <br />
B00005V9IJ|5.0|How do you write, direct, act, and put out a full length movie focused on one man stranded on an island that is not only tolerable but entertaining?  You have Robert Zemeckis, William Broyles Jr., and Tom Hanks create Cast Away.  Emotional, insightful, a very good movie.
1592401791|3.0|Geoff Emerick's book is both fascinating and very annoying. First, the book is a tribute and ode to Paul McCartney -- a veritable Paul love-fest! It's like Geoff sat down and thought: \\"Geez, it seems that Paul may not be as widely loved or respected as John or George. I need to do something. I know, I'll write a book...\\" <br /> <br />For example, the following quotes from the book: <br /> <br />\\"...Paul saved the band.\\" (pg. 212) <br /> <br />\\"In the end, Ringo gave a strong performance, thanks in no small part to Paul...\\" (pg. 214) <br /> <br />\\"Paul, of course, was always extremely friendly and courteous toward the teenagers that would gather around the studio gates.\\" (pg. 218) <br /> <br />(With regard to the bad reviews for the MMT film) \\"...it was simply a starting point for Paul in his career in film. After all, you have to start somewhere.\\" (pg. 219) <br /> <br />Is it me, or is this nauseating? The WHOLE book is like that. Geoff marginalizes the contributions of George and Ringo to almost nothing. He obviously believes John was very talented, but was an inept mess who would have been lost without Paul. Geoff goes as far to state the Paul was the clearly the band's leader, although the both Ringo and George have both stated otherwise. Sorry, but it's all too much. <br /> <br />That said, the book is fascinating in parts. The Pepper sessions are mesmerizing. Also, it is surprising how hard the Beatles worked in the studio. The relationship between Paul and John is interesting also. I'm surprised, however, how little new information Geoff adds to the well worn stories. In fact, some of his memories almost seem to be tailored to fit the commonly told tales. <br /> <br />It is an enjoyable and easy read, but frustrating in its \\"Paul is bigger than Jesus\\" context. It could have been so much more.   <br />
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|The album, while I admit is hard to get used to (because people fear change) Every time I buy a strokes album I find this is the case. Did you want them to make an album that sounded like the last one....? exactly... This is a new sound and I urge you to listen to it more than once to gain appreciation for it. Who gives a rats arse if Julian casablancas had a alcohol problem... Or any of the above formentioned politics involved with making a third album... This album is new and has a certaiun quality that becomes more apparent upon familiarizing yourself with the songs. The reviews I have read so far have been from people that skipped through the songs and didnt really listen to it. ALSO I DONT KNOW WHAT THE HECK YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT. THE SECOND ALBUM IS AWESOME EVRY SONG IS GOOD. OR MAYBE ITS JUST NOT YOUR TYPE OF MUSIC...THEREFORE IF YOUR NOT INTO THAT KIND OF MUSIC WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE A REVIEW. LEAVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY LIKE THE STROKES. THEY WILL BETTER BE ABLE TO JUDGE IT IN COMPARIOSON WITH THE PREVIOUS ALBUMS. TO ME IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE THESE GUYS JUST EVOLVED MUSICALLY. THE SONGS GROW ON YOU

B0002F6AH0|4.0|\\"The World At War\\" richly deserves its reputation as the greatest WWII documentary ever produced. The deft usage of rare wartime footage and once-in-a-lifetime interviews, along with the great narration delivered by Laurence Olivier, created a powerful, harrowing, and deeply compelling portrait of the war. As far as WWII documentaries are concerned, \\"The World At War\\" is unlikely to be surpassed.    But there is one major flaw with the series, and that is Episode 7: \\"Red Star\\", which discusses the war on the Eastern Front. While the episode dutifully reminds the viewer of the 20 million Soviet citizens who perished at the hands of the Nazis, it neglects to mention -- in fact, seems to deliberately gloss over -- the utterly ruthless acts of coercion and discipline that Stalin had his generals and political commissars enforce against both Soviet civilians and soldiers. There is no mention of besieged Leningrad civilians being shot by commissars and soldiers on suspicion of stealing food; no mention of Soviet soldiers being arbitrarily shot for any slim accusation of \\"cowardice\\" at the front; no mention that Soviet-backed partisan guerrila fighters would often loot Russian villages for food and supplies, leaving the villages with nothing, and sometimes forcing the residents to take refuge in frozen forests.     Worst of all, the writers of this episode have Olivier narrarate, without qualification, \\"Collaborators were shot,\\" when referring to partisan-executed rural peasants suspected of Nazi collaboration. The problem is, most of the time, these \\"collaborators\\" were completely innocent. But don't tell that to episode writer Neal Ascherson, who has Olivier recite lines that sound like they were cribbed from the pages of Pravda.    As a recent writer on the Eastern Front has observed, with both Stalin and Hitler acting brutally, the Soviet people of the war were \\"caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.\\" The episode \\"Red Star\\" seems to want to whitewash the brutality of the Soviet regime against its own citizens during WWII.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|As SYRIANA's uninspired but accurate tag line reads, \\"Everything is connected.\\" And that's why you're going to want to have the subtitles turned \\"On\\" and your finger on your remote's freeze-frame button for this movie. Please take notes as the film progresses. There will be a test, the first question of which is \\"Did you get it?\\"<br /><br />Your truthful answer will be, \\"No.\\" You will then watch SYRIANA a second time. Carefully.<br /><br />Assuming you have at least a bachelor's degree in history and/or are a current events maven, you now have the gist of this most excellent picture. Alright, I'm exaggerating, but I'm not complaining! It's nice not to have one's intelligence insulted by a domestic, big budget move. Truthfully, my only quibble with this nuanced film is that the radiant Greta Scacchi (playing Clooney's wife) had all her scenes cut.<br /><br />SIDELIGHT: When the refinery workers are watching TV in their barracks early in the film, the movie they are watching is THE OUTSIDERS. Later, when our young Muslim character Wasim is asked for his name outside the immigration office,  he replies \\"Johnny\\" (the name of Ralph Macchio's greaser character in The Outsiders who gets severely beaten.) Wasim is then severely beaten.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just a short note to say that this was a VERY innovative and exciting show. Definitely ranks in my top 10 of all time television. The characters are wonderful, the plots were fun. This show needs to be brought back (hint, hint to Fox or the Scifi Channel!) <br /> <br />A worthy investment.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|i absoloutly love panic at the disco's cd.  they have catchy music that makes me want to jump up out of my seat and start dancing.  they are fun and original.  i could listen to them for hours on end (and i do) without getting bored.  they are just plain great.  i think that this has to be the best cd i have heard for a very long time.  panic at the disco is pure fun and talent.  there is never a dull moment in any of there songs.  i highly recomend this cd and it deserves all five of the stars i am giving it.  it is fun original, catchy, and great for everyone, wether your into punk, rap, rock, or anything this cd is for you.
B0000074GK|5.0|I bought this CD MANY years ago because I loved the music of Andy Taylor (he produced this, I think)and have loved it since.  The music is great and \\"Englishman on Holiday\\" is funny. It didn't get nearly the credit it deserved back then.  It's good, timeless rock and roll.
1592401791|5.0|Another Beatles coverage wouldn't seem necessary, but there's often a new angle to explore - as Geoff Emerick provides in HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE: MY LIFE RECORDING THE MUSIC OF THE BEATLES. Emerick came to EMI Studios on Abbey Road at the age of 15 to interview as an assistant engineer and helped out on sessions with producer George Martin. His involvement in a new, popular Liverpool band gave him a front seat to their heyday of achievement, allowing him to observe close-up the collaborations, competitions and interactions within the group. His insider's observations are unparalleled, making this a top pick for any avid Beatles fan who can't get enough.<br /><br />Diane C. Donovan<br /><br />California Bookwatch
B00004Y6NV|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite albums.  It has blues, rock, country and perhaps even a tad jazzy.  I don't know if all Dire Straits albums satisfy as much as this one does, but if they do, I'm a huge fan!
B000068VHP|5.0|This CD was the Cranberries' first, and was refreshing even though they deviated little from middle of the road pop. Dolores O'Riordan's lovely Irish voice, delivered periodically in a grunge style, made this debut album fun to hear. In general the music here is safe, though the lyrics sometimes are not. The Cranberries have a history of choosing sometimes distressing topics for their music. It can sometimes be uncomfortable to confront their world, which seems to be tainted by despair and a variety of angst.<br /><br />\\"I Still Do\\" is an angst-ridden track, heavy on mellow bass, about someone who is in love, and wants to break it off, even though that person is still in love. The reason for breaking it off is not clear, and it need not be. This song is the generic break up song when you have mixed feelings about the relationship but realize that it is in at least one person's best interests to end the relationship.<br /><br />We go from the angst of a possibly impossible relationship to the dream relationship in \\"Dreams,\\" which was featured in \\"You've Got Mail.\\" A pretty, fast-paced, song, Dolores tells her significant other that she has given herself to him, and he now has her heart, so please don't hurt her. She also says that she is amazed by his mind and how caring and understanding he is. The ethereal music with a rock beat I personally find to be very satisfying.<br /><br />We go back to angst again with \\"Sunday.\\" This time the singer cares for or loves someone, but can't seem to make the connection. This situation has happened to me, and I'll bet it's happened to many of you. Dolores starts singing this one is a grunge style, slowly. Then the pace picks up and the song attains a solid pop beat. Seems like anything Dolores sings is pretty.<br /><br />\\"Pretty\\" has throwaway lyrics to vaguely blues-sounding music with heavy bass. Dolores gets to trill her voice in that endearing way. My guess is that the intent of the lyrics is to be there for the sound more than for the meaning. It works!<br /><br />\\"Waltzing Back\\" is an angry song. How did these people come back into your life? They are going to take you away from me. It's not fair. In the end, there's nothing she can do about it; it's your life. It doesn't mean she has to be happy about it.<br /><br />I like the next song. The style of \\"Sorry\\" makes solid use of Dolores's ability to hit high notes. This song is combination anger and angst; she's upset and angry, but at the same time you sense that she wanted it to work out. She still misses him, but is still angry too. The rock beat in the background punctuates her anger with heavy bass and percussion, and a fast beat. There is a good contrast musically between her bluesy angst laments and her anger.<br /><br />The Cranberries love angst about love. \\"Linger\\" tells how she saw her significant other with someone else, and communicates the hurt she feels. She wonders why he can't just go with her instead of letting her believe that they have any hope of a relationship. This song is all string laments; solid angst.<br /><br />And the angst just keeps on rolling with \\"Wanted.\\" A fast-paced song, here Dolores sings about the communication gap between two people, and their ability to understand each other's needs. Just what is it you want, what are you trying to say?<br /><br />\\"Still Can't...\\" starts acoustically, and then takes off with bass and backing drums. Dolores' sultry voice expresses her anger that her significant other is telling lies about the situation between her and him. He won't apologize, he's laughing about the situation behind her back. I don't think I'd want to be the other person in this song.<br /><br />\\"I Will Always\\" expresses the simple thought that she gives everything of herself to him. He needs to do whatever he will do, and she'll be there. The music here is slow and mellow, Dolores sings very slowly, mournfully. She still manages to hit the high notes with a grunge flavor, even though it's not really a grunge song. Grunge blues maybe.<br /><br />I get the feeling that \\"How\\" is the Cranberries version of \\"You're so Vain,\\" which was sung by Carly Simon. The words express how he is self-centered, and he left her alone, at least emotionally, if not physically. Dolores was looking for a closeness that he isn't providing. There is a heavy drum beat in this relatively fast-paced song.<br /><br />\\"Put Me Down\\" again makes such wonderful use of Dolores's voice, sultry to start and then going for the high notes. The topic of the song is pretty much like the title says: she keeps getting put down; she keeps trying, but keeps getting treated like a second-class person; this was a lovely song to finish off the original CD.<br /><br />There are several versions of this CD.  This version has five tracks added to the original release.  I am a little mixed on the value of these tracks.  I like the Cranberries a lot, and so the bonus tracks are nice to have.  However, are they worth the extra money this CD costs over the previous version?  That depends on how much you like the Cranberries.  If you are a huge fan, the extra tracks are nice to have.  Otherwise, if you have the original version, this CD did not have any improvement over the previous version that I could tell.<br /><br />This CD is full of heavily orchestrated music, very well played. Dolores has an incredible vocal range, and her Irish accent adds something to these songs. There are so many influences that it is hard to categorize the music. I call it lovely and mellow, and my favorite Cranberries CD. I give this CD five stars plus.gh it's not really a grunge song. Grunge blues maybe. <br /> <br />I get the feeling that \\"How\\" is the Cranberries version of \\"You're so Vain,\\" which was sung by Carly Simon.

This version has five tracks added to the original release.  I am a little mixed on the value of these tracks.  I like the Cranberries a lot, and so the bonus tracks are nice to have.  However, are they worth the extra money this CD costs over the previous version?  That depends on how much you like the Cranberries.  If you are a huge fan, the extra tracks are nice to have.  Otherwise, if you have the original version, this CD did not have any improvement over the previous version that I could tell. <br /> <br />This CD is full of heavily orchestrated music, very well played. Dolores has an incredible vocal range, and her Irish accent adds something to these songs. There are so many influences that it is hard to categorize the music. I call it lovely and mellow, and my favorite Cranberries CD. I give this CD five stars plus.  <br />

B000007T1M|5.0|Not many band's greatest cd comes on their debut album, but in System's case it's so obvious to me that this is their most energetic, heavy, and best all-around performance. Most fans believe Toxicity to be their greatest cd, and they have a very good case. That's also an unbelievable cd, but I really believe this self-titled debut album to be the best. S.O.A.D. is easily one of the most unique bands out there. With Daron's creative guitar style and musical inventiveness, and Serj's extraordinary voice, and then Shavo's great bass playing, and John's different drum style, this band was destined for fame. What I love about this cd is that you can tell they had a great time writing and playing the music. Just listen to some of the humorous lyrics and Serj's screechy vocals. Daron doesn't get the credit that should be asserted to him. He is the primary song writer for this band and many times, it's confused with Serj being the main writer.<br /><br />There are no bad songs whatsoever on this cd. Every song has a certain energy to it. Spiders and Sugar are the most well known on here, but my favorites are Darts, Peephole, Suite-Pee, and Know. Serj's angry political chants mix together greatly with Daron's heavy guitar playing. If you've seen the music videos for Spiders or Sugar, they're really weird and different. Check em' out if you haven't yet, they're pretty cool. I think System's first three cds are all worthy of 5 stars. Mezmerize was a 3.5 in my book. And Hypnotize was a 4. I wish they'd go back to the heavy, hard hitting days like the 1-3 cds.<br /><br />Get your self a copy of this cd. It's #1 in System's catalog. They really bring a weird,different, incredibly great sounding cd up to the table. It won't dissapoint. As always, most of the songs are extremely short, but there are 13 of them. This is how I put their cds in order- Best to Worst.<br /><br />1.System Of A Down<br /><br />2.Toxicity<br /><br />3.Steal This Album<br /><br />4.Hypnotize<br /><br />5.Mezmerize
B00004Y6O9|5.0|This album changed the sound and style of rock and roll guitar forever.   <br /> <br />Listen to some of the best Marshall Super Lead amplifier sounds ever recorded, combined with ground breaking guitar playing style and the energy of early Van Halen.   <br /> <br />It's not just the guitar solos and lead playing, there is a lot of great rhythm guitar playing and fills that get overlooked.  Keep in mind that there is only one guitar player in this band and there are very, very few overdubs on this album.  <br /> <br />Producer Ted Templeman and engineer Don Landee also deserve mention for capturing these sounds.  These guys brought more out of the band's sound in this album compared to previous demo recordings.

As a matter of fact, she can do that from sentence one - and move on with a story.

We start following the life of this woman when she is still in her late teens until when we are able to see her evolution as a human being, a daughter, a wife, a mother. This so called evolution involves many discoveries and deceptions.

B00063EMJ6|5.0|Of the sixteen tracks in this collection, my opinion is that fourteen of them are outstanding. These would be all except \\"Down By the River\\" and \\"Cowgirl in the Sand.\\" These are very good songs, just not superb, and I regard their inclusion as a bonus to an otherwise stellar collection. Unfortunately, the two weakest songs kick off the CD, run about ten minutes each and drag the flow of the CD. Once the third song (Cinnamon Girl) begins, however, the CD really picks up momentum and doesn't let up. He's really at his best when evoking moral outrage at an injustice, as in \\"Ohio\\" or \\"Southern Man,\\" or when singing about highly personal issues, as in \\"The Needle and the Damage Done\\" and \\"Old Man.\\" Plus, it is virtually impossible to not like \\"Heart of Gold,\\" \\"Harvest Moon\\" and most of the songs in this collection. Highly recommended for the casual Neil Young fan or admirer, such as myself.

B000000OAC|4.0|Along with the change in the UK's social climate in the late 1970's, the raw, stark and passionate fury of a new generation of music was inevitably thriving and infiltrating the musical mainstream, tearing down the dominant progressive rock veil with a frenzied attack of buzz-saw guitars. And, finding themselves unfashionable and more than just a little unpopular, the heavily criticised and ever-controversial Queen were also evolving and adapting. News of the World, released 1st November, 1977, documents this transition. <br /> <br />And transition is the operative word here, for although their sixth studio album would showcase some entirely new musical experimentation (which Queen were always so respectable for embracing throughout their career), all of their classic trademarks can be heard here amidst their newer, fresher production. A complete change in musical direction from it's predecessor, A Day At The Races, and unlike anything the band had released before or since, News of the World is truly a one-off, and in the uncertainty of where the band were heading, proved itself with that typical Queen arrogance and complacency with the success of its double A Side singles, `We Are The Champions' and `We Will Rock You'.  <br /> <br />Queen were indeed responding to the changing times, reinventing their sound and appealing to a whole new generation whilst subconsciously (or ingeniously?) retaining all the aspects of their musical persona that their loyal fans cherished so much. The album's bleak wintery undertones and sober lyricism made Queen accessible to the more persuasive of the punk movement by the fact you could actually relate to the song matter on News of the World (noticeable too in Mercury's vocals, that retained simplicity and focus as opposed to his superhuman workouts on previous albums), the group trading in their previous artistic fantasy epics for death, boredom, heartbreak, homelessness, suicide, and dead end jobs (you won't find a Bohemian Rhapsodyequivalent on this disc, in fact, with delicious sarcasm, the only 5 minute plus number on this disc is the Zeppliny guitar-based hard rocker `It's Late',), and yet there was also that familiar great humour and ballsy passion their earlier work featured that makes the album as a whole more digestible.  <br /> <br />And the formula here is the trademark theatrical songwriting we all know and love Queen for, there's residual darkness heralding back to the days of Queen II (`All Dead, All Dead', `Spread Your Wings', `My Melancholy Blues',) the upbeat singalong number provided by John Deacon (`Who Needs You?'), the Roger Taylor and Brian May lead vocal track (the churning, funky `Fight From The Inside' & the bluesy `Sleeping On The Sidewalk') flat out rock and roll (`Sheer Heart Attack') and that overt sexuality that was typically Freddie Mercury (`Get Down, Make Love'), still with plenty of surprises and lashings of May's treacle sounding guitar tones along the way.  <br /> <br />News of the World is a milestone in Queen's career, a testament to their staying power in the rock and roll hierarchy and their last truly great album of the 1970's. You see, Queen would never quite sound the same after this album, (ironically symbolised in the album cover that features the band being killed by a giant robot?) and whether you see that as a good or bad thing is your own decision to make, but this LP is the one that instigated that crossover (by displaying the band's decision to follow the music chart mainstream) and is simply a great album all on it's own. Compulsory for Queen fans and definitely an exciting listen for anyone who believes Queen to be the 80's electronic sounding pop/rock outfit they became or the pompous, operatic progressive glam rockers they were, News of the World is unique and highly recommended.  <br /> <br />Whatever you think, the music here is it what it is, and it's undeniably impressive. <br />

0385512058|4.0|Not too long ago, I met two grown men in vastly different positions in their work field. One was a PR manager for a Fortune 500 company; the other was a professor at a high school. The former graduated from Maryland with a Bachelor degree in Communications, the other- high school professor- had an MBA from American University in Business Management. The obvious question that echoes in your head, as it did in mine, is why did the guy with an MBA find himself with a much less profitable job. The answer to this question lay in his answer to the question I asked the day I met him which was \\"do you have any connections in American that may help me get into their MBA program?\\" As you are probably guessing, his answer was no. He went through his entire two years at AU without making any significant contacts and this coyness resulted in the second-rate fate of his career. The former Maryland graduate, however, was a networking mogul. He kept a palm pilot filled with the names and numbers of old friends and acquaintances. This is the essence of this book. It speaks of the importance of networking as well as, and most importantly, how to do it well.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Yes like everyone else I have heard Mariah Carey's singles for the past decade or so and I must say I was not impressed at all-she had no sudlty and was unasamadley a walking commercial.'The Emancipation Of Mimi' changed my opinion all the way around.For once Mariah uses all the shadings of her voice-her vocal shading as WELL as her normal rangely vocal gymnastics,which is terrific don't get me wrong.As far as a composer AND singer her growning achivment in the uptempo department is the wonderful \\"Say Something\\"-stripped down,a steady beat,lightly synthesized and a very unique sense of melody.\\"It's Like That\\",\\"Shake It Off\\" and \\"Get Your Number\\" are all similarly wonderful-when a guest singer or hip-hopper appears it is almost as another instument and never intrudes.The most impressive of these songs are the lean,soul drenced ballads-\\"We Belong Together\\",\\"Mine Again\\",\\"Your Girl\\" and \\"I Wish I Knew\\" are all fabulous but on the other hand \\"Circles\\" and \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" are plain triumphant-great electric piano and freeing words.Like just about anything that Mariah Carey does there are some highly produced elements but unlike before nothing reduces to sacchrine or disposibility.It is all in good taste.It doesn't matter-Mariah has always had a great instrument of a voice and I have never heard it used better then on this CD.

B000F1IQNM|5.0|Cedric Brown has just had another Nanny quit. His unruly brood of seven children drove her screaming out into the street and he is desperate to find a replacement. His scullery maid, Evangeline, does what she can to help, but Brown goes to the Nanny agency to find a full-time Nanny. However, no Nanny will work with the Brown family. Mr. Brown hears a mysterious voice telling him he needs to hire Nanny McPhee, so when she shows up at his doorstep, he is only too glad to offer her employment. Nanny McPhee has magical powers that she uses on the children, but that only solves one of Mr. Brown's problems. His late wife's Aunt Adelaide has been sending him money to help support the family, but she threatens to withhold the money unless Mr. Brown remarries quickly. Desperate to marry (and unable to recognize who he truly loves), Brown arranges to marry a truly obnoxious woman who threatens the happiness of the entire Brown family. But not to worry, Nanny McPhee still has some magic up her sleeve.<br /><br />Nanny McPhee is a very nice, enjoyable family film (although it will probably appeal more to women than men).  The movie is a cross between \\"Mary Poppins\\" and \\"The Sound of Music\\" (without the singing). It has lots of magic and silly goofy fun (as an adult I groaned at yet another food fight in a movie, but kids will love the scene). There's lot of eccentric characters, starting with Nanny McPhee herself and onto the cook, Aunt Adelaide, Mr. Brown's coworkers, and Mrs. Quickly, the would-be second Mrs. Brown. Kids will love the sight gags, especially the ones involving animals. Adults will appreciate running gags such as Nanny McPhee insisting \\"I did knock\\" each time she magically appears in a room.<br /><br />The actors all have fun with their parts. Emma Thompson (who also wrote the screenplay) has particular fun as Nanny McPhee. Colin Firth is appropriately bewildered as Mr. Brown who has no control over his children or the women in his life. Angela Lansbury has great fun as nearly blind Aunt Adelaide. Kelly Macdonald is radiant as Evangeline, willing to do anything for Mr. Brown and his family. The child actors are all good. Thomas Sangster is a standout as the troublemaking Simon; but then again, his is the showiest role amongst the children.<br /><br />Highly recommended for family viewing.great fun as nearly blind Aunt Adelaide.

B0000T70K4|5.0|Eric Packer believes that there is order and symmetry in everything in the world. With this premise he became wealthy, by predicting how currencies rise and dip. Just a few times does he let himself wander in the realm of the metaphysical, but as he says: \\"Freud is finished, Einstein is next\\". To him the world is made up of 1s and 0s. This makes him, especially in the eyes of the people whose money he manages, a visionary. <br /> <br />He has eye for the mathematical oddities, his building has a prime number of floors and later, when he meets someone who will change his life forever, after he has lost all his money, the age of that person is 41, also a prime number.  <br /> <br />But he feels `unheimisch' as if something is going to happen that he cannot control, as he asks his passengers on page 14. It is something that he cannot predict, while he can predict almost everything. When he is unsettled, his elevator plays Satie and ¼ speed, when he knows who he is, he dresses in double time. <br /> <br />Eric Packer spends most of the novel in a white limousine on the streets of New York. Not a smooth ride as the President of the United States and the funeral procession of one of his favorite rap stars, who he plays in one of his elevators all the time, are halting him. Time around the limo changes speed. Sometimes they stand still, sometimes people hurry by. <br /> <br />While in the limo he watches tv and sees two of his rivals being killed on tv. He loves it, loves the replays (replaying time) and slow motion (slowing of time).  <br /> <br />DeLillo's play with time is amazing. He slows it down, speeds it up, as if time is anything but a constant. In the limo Eric sees building in the distance, built just to speed up time. <br />During the ride he speaks with his company philosopher who mentions that `the idea is time, living in the future'. Clock time accelerated production, making time a corporate asset. She predicts something will happen to correct this acceleration. When they are looking at a ticker, they cannot even read everything, it is going too fast, `too fleet to be absorbed'. But to him it's the sacred flow of information, and information is life.  <br /> <br />In earlier works DeLillo has critized the corporate, capitalist society that we all live in. A society that makes people more removed from themselves. Eric is the perfect example; he likes the void in poems, likes to see people get killed and even kills himself. He is comparable to the main character from Easton Ellis' `American Psycho'. When things get asymmetrical, he loses touch. To keep some sense of being alive, he has his heart checked every day by a doctor and sees it every day on a little heart monitor.  <br /> <br />Again DeLillo shows why he is one of the most important authors of the last 25 years. The novel is short, but every sentence holds a promise that there is more to come. When you read the book for a second time you will be pleasantly surprised.  <br /> <br />My favorite DeLillo after `Underworld'. A great fin-de-siecle book.

B000002KK8|3.0|Dire Straits' sound is definitely unique and easily identifiable.  Some people may consider that a good thing.  Others will use it as a reason to claim that they suck.  The truth of the matter is, if you like Dire Straits at all, chances are you'll like all of it.  If you don't like any of what you know, you probably won't like the rest. <br /> <br />Communique, the bands Sophomore effort, is really not much of a divergence from their debut.  Sure, there's no \\"Sultans of Swing\\" to knock your socks off.  The overall feel here is more subdued.  The one thing that is the same, though, is Mark Knopfler's brilliant guitar work and lyrical stylings. <br /> <br />If you're looking for an entry point to the highlights of Dire Straits' works, a better bet would be either their next album, Making Movies.  An even better choice would be their fifth album, Love Over Gold.  Both are superb showcases for Knopfler's brilliance as a musician and songwriter and definitely display more character.  That is, the songs are more individualistic.  I suppose they got better at writing good hooks. <br /> <br />Obviously, I am in the camp of those who like everything Dire Straits did, although admittedly some of it is... well... a bit boring.  The standouts on Communique include \\"Lady Writer\\", \\"Angel of Mercy\\" and \\"Portobello Belle\\" which is a nice foreshadowing of the style explored further on Making Movies.  Overall, I'd consider Communique somewhat average with respect to the rest of their catalog.  If you're not a D.S. completist, don't go out of your way to pick this one up.

0671027387|5.0|I enjoyed this book perhaps even more than I enjoyed the Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons. It was such a fast paced book that just grabbed me into the plot and the suspense was excellent. I guess you can say that about the other 2 books as well, but with this one I feel it had the MOST. The only reason the Da Vinci Code got so much publicity over the other books was because it posed controversy, while this and Angels and Demons were based on completely fictional premises (I know the illuminati wasnt fictional, but the book didn't pose any controversial issue about it).<br /><br />So don't be tricked by the media, and definitely read the Deception Point novel. You will not be dissapointed.
1594481938|3.0|For some reason I can't quite explain Nick Hornby is my single concession to reading novels written after the 1950s. He's clever, amusing, and careful enough that the apparent modern-day absence of editors doesn't pose a problem. \\"A Long Way Down\\" concerns a typically Hornbyesque collection of self-absorbed, extraordinarily philosophical nobodies. One of them, as usual, shares and expounds Hornby's strange obsession with pop music. This book is not on the level of \\"High Fidelity\\", but for Hornby fans it will do.
B00005JOX6|4.0|The closest Adam Sandler has come to a great film to this point in his career is \\"50 First Dates.\\"  As far as I was concerned get rid of Rob Schneider as Ula and cut the vomiting Walrus and you would have a five star movie.  \\"Click\\" is in the same mold in that it combines Sandler's romantic side with a unusual situation and still insists on adding raunchy humor (I suppose there could be worse things than your dog trying to have sex with a giant stuffed duck, but let us not go there).  Consequently, \\"Click\\" is not an improvement on \\"50 First Dates,\\" but I do not think that it constitutes a step backwards, which would be welcomed news.<br /><br />Sandler plays Michael Newman, who has married beyond his reach the gorgeous Donna (Kate Beckinsale), and has two young kids who love him, his son Ben (Joseph Castanon) and his daughter (Tatum McCann), despite the fact that he is so busy trying to make partner at the architecture firm where he works that he is ignoring his family more and more each day.  Every time he makes a promise to his family, he feels forced bo break it to satisfy John Ammer (David Hasselhoff) at work.  Things are getting so bad that Michael suddenly decides that what he needs ia a universal remote, just like the O'Doyle's next door, so that at least he can turn on his TV instead of the overhead fan.  So he heads off into the night and since Bed, Bath and Beyond is the only store opens, goes in to find his universal remote.  What he finds instead in the Beyond part of the store is Morty (Christopher Walken), who indeed has a universal remote, and not just your ordinary universal remote, as I assume everybody knows from the previews.<br /><br />I must say up front that I am pretty sure I could listen to Christopher Walken say anything, up to an including the instructions for using a universal remote or any other form of technology and be thoroughly entertained.  I would also add that Morty is absolutely right about Donna's body.  Anyway, with his amazing universal remote Michael quickly learns that he can use it to control his world and click away his problems, from muting his dog, fast-forwarding through fights with his wife, and pausing his boss so that he can slap the guy silly (although I think close-captioning would have been funnier for the scene with the Japanese businessmen at the restaurant).  Then Michael discovers the catch.<br /><br />It is not, as the trailer would lead you to believe, that the remote breaks.  But rather, as Morty explains, that it functions like Tivo in that it pays attention to what he is doing with the remote and automatically does it again.  So if you decide to fast-forward through an illness or foreplay with your wife, then that becomes the way it will be for the rest of your life.  This is a fairly interesting idea given the premise of the film, and the only real flaw in it is that once you establish Michael is on \\"auto pilot\\" during the chapters of his life that are skipped, then I do not see how he could be so successful at his business given that he has to use the remote to save the bacon with the Japanese firm.  But that is just because I pay attention to the rules of the game and like to take them to their logical extensions.<br /><br />Sandler has gathered familiar faces for this film, with Henry Winkler playing Michael's father, Sean Astin as Ben's swim coach, and even a nice cameo by Schneider, whose understate performance encouraged my hopes for this film.  Perhaps the biggest surprise here is that the raunchy humor got me to laugh out loud several times, even if a grown man striking back at the Eddie Haskell-wannabee who lives next door would be wrong, very wrong indeed (but still funny).  However, my wife would like me to state in no uncertain terms that what I was laughing at was clearly guy humor, and I am pretty sure she rolled her eyes and shook her head more often than she joined in on the laughing (it was hard to tell, the theater was dark and I was trying to watch the movie).<br /><br />Ultimately, the problem with the movie is the end, when Michael gets his second chance.  That is because the screenplay by Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe (the team who did \\"Bruce Almighty\\") invests so much in the big epiphany and final grace note at the end of the third act that they apparently have nothing much to come up with for the epilogue where we are assured Michael and his family will live happily ever after.  \\"50 First Dates\\" had a great final payoff scene, and you can go all the way back to \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" to see how well you can milk the return from Hell to the real world.  Granted, you will not top the end of the Hell sequence, but then you are not supposed to.  Still, there has to be a better payoff for what comes between that point and the start of the credits.  I am still rounding up on this one, but I should have been in a position to round down.  Final Note: Nice touch with getting Dolores O'Riordan from the Cranberries to show up to sing \\"Linger\\" live at the wedding.trying to watch the movie). <br /> <br />Ultimately, the problem with the movie is the end, when Michael gets his second chance.

0399900705|4.0|I read this in the libary for curiousity after seeing the TV mini-series and 2003 re-make.  While written in the 1980s, this book's concept could still rival other works written today.<br /><br />If any of you have seen the movie or TV mini-series, you know the premise.  A spy is shot in the back, revived by a doctor, and struggles to regain not only his identity, but his mission.  He learns his name is Jason Bourne, but is he really a reputable cold-blooded killer like others say he is?  While some spy novels only contain biff-bam action, this story contains enough suspense and plot twists to keep the reader glued.<br /><br />The only things not making this book a 5 star are the old style cover and the COMPLEX back-story of Bourne's origin.  Other than that, you have an excellent example of spy fiction at its heyday.
B000002IAZ|5.0|\\"For What It's Worth (Stop, Hey What's That Sound) \\" only made it to #7 on the Billboard Singles chart in 1967, but the song written by Stephen Stills with its opening line, \\"There's something happenin' here / What it is ain't exactly clear\\" would make it one of the signature songs of the decade.  Stills wrote the song in the aftermath of the Sunset Strip riots of 1966-67, and while it is not strictly speaking a protest song, it has become considered one pretty much from the moment people first heard it played.  For most people \\"For What It's Worth\\" is the only Buffalo Springfield song they remember, which is why \\"Retrospective: The Best of Buffalo Springfield\\" serves as a reminder that there was more there and why this group stands out in the history of rock music as the number two folk-rock (if not country-rock) group after the Byrds.<br /><br />The original Buffalo Springfield lineup consisted of guitarists Stephen Stills, Richie Furay, and Neil Young, along with Bruce Palmer on bass and Dewey Martin on drums, with Jim Messina replacing Palmer when the other Canadian in the group had deportation problems.  The group was only together for a couple of years, releasing \\"Buffalo Springfield\\" in 1967, and \\"Buffalo Springfield Again\\" and \\"Last Time Around\\" in 1968.  This hits collection came out the following year and basically provides the groups most recognizable songs from a commercial standpoint, which is not necessarily what fans of the group think are their best tunes.  Still wrote the two songs with the best chart success, \\"Bluebird\\" (#58) and \\"Rock 'n' Roll\\" (#44), while the other two singles released by the group were written by Young, \\"Expecting to Fly\\" (#98) and \\"On the Way Home\\" (#82).  But Furay is represented by only one song, \\"Kind Woman,\\" which is totally inadequate, even if he did not write anything on the group's debut effort.  Surprisingly, Young ends up with more songs than Stills, but when have the gamut of music of Buffalo Springfield when you have the country-rock \\"Go and Say Goodbye\\" and the pop song \\"Sit Down I Think I Love You,\\" both written by Stills.  The result is that this is certainly a decent introduction to the music of Buffalo Springfield, but nobody is going to claim that the dozen tracks here are the twelve best songs by the group.  Just as nobody would deny that on a percentage basis \\"Retrospective\\" earns at least a passing grade.<br /><br />The \\"Whatever happened to Buffalo Springfield?\\" question actually became part of their legacy, because basically everybody in the band ended up being successful after the group dissolved.  Neil Young bolted first for his celebrated solo career before embracing the irony of reuniting with Stephen Stills as the fourth wheel on Crosby, Stills, & Nash.  Stills also did solo albums as well as forming the band Manassas.  Jim Messina and Richie Furay continued to work together as part of the country-rock group Poco for several albums before Messina bolted to become a hit duo with Kenny Loggins.  Furay soon followed and joined with J.D. Souther and Chris Hillman to form the Souther Hillman Furay Band, before doing his own solo career.  Dewey Martin started off putting together the New Buffalo Springfield, which then became New Buffalo and then Blue Mountain Eagles before starting a new group named Dewey Martin and Medicine Ball.  I find it interesting that after the relative anonymity of being in Buffalo Springfield that every body in the group ended up in a band for which their individual names where part of the group's name.  If that speaks to the egos that made the fracturing of Buffalo Springfield inevitable, then so be it.u have the country-rock \\"Go and Say Goodbye\\" and the pop song \\"Sit Down I Think I Love You,\\" both written by Stills.

B00018HULS|4.0|You always feel a little behind-the-pack when you first hear an album 2 years after it's intial release. Concordantly, you feel like a bigger tool when you review an album 2 years after it's initial release. That, however, is precisely what I am doing. In my defense, the album wasn't released in the United States until January 10, 2006. I think there's a good 4 month window where it is appropriate to review a piece of work and I generally follow that rule of thumb. So, seeing as how I have never been outside of the United States of America, I finde it more than appropriate to review Sia's 2004 album \\"Colour the Small One.\\"<br /><br />Disclaimers aside, this is a beautiful album. Being, as the Europeans would say, a narrow-minded American, you have probably never become acquainted with Sia, at least in the personal sense. Fans of the group Zero 7 can immediately distinguish her voice as a frequent guest vocalist for the group, including the song \\"In the Waiting Line\\" from the Garden State soundtrack. Her voice is soft, intimate, and painful. A random assortment of adjectives, yes, but it accurately depicts the heart and soul of this album.<br /><br />At first listen, you'll love it. This is not a stretch. But listen to it again, focus on the lyrics and you'll be entering Sia's world, where her most intimate thoughts and emotions are revealed. It's a refreshing experience, but at the same time, a frightening one. So rarely does an artist open up and become frank with her audience. It's as if Fiona Apple softened her voice and made an entire album of the song \\"Parting Gift.\\"<br /><br />Sia begins the album by proclaiming \\"You don't know me/You can't hold me/I'll slip through your hands/I am one single grain of sand.\\" However, by the end of the album you'll feel as if you know her better than herself, and in truth, you just might. Indeed, with tracks like \\"Natale's Song,\\" it's hard not to feel like you've known this girl for years (\\"She barely speaks/But I hear her breathing/That's all I need...Momentarily, she brings peace to me\\").<br /><br />\\"Colour the Small One\\" is best summed up as Sia beautifully sings \\"I can't detach from the past and all of the pain/I need to learn, start from scratch begin again.\\" As you listen to this album you realize what a cathartic experience this must have been for the artist. Though she makes herself immensly vulnerable, it is particularly comforting to know that when it's all said and done, she has grown as a person and as an artist. As listeners, we can only thank her for letting us all partake in that experience.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Tori Amos and Feist. Don't pass up this album.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br /><br />1. \\"The Bully\\"<br /><br />2. \\"Natale's Song\\"<br /><br />3. \\"The Church of What's Happening Now\\"<br /><br />4. \\"Where I Belong\\"<br /><br />4 out of 5 Starsher breathing/That's all I need...Momentarily, she brings peace to me\\").  <br /> <br />\\"Colour the Small One\\" is best summed up as Sia beautifully sings \\"I can't detach from the past and all of the pain/I need to learn, start from scratch begin again.\\" As you listen to this album you realize what a cathartic experience this must have been for the artist.

B000000OU6|4.0|The first time i listened to this I couldn't get through the whole thing I disliked this very much I a now relize now why it's because it's not Guns N Roses just because some of the members are in it as in VR they do not sound like GNR get over that and there is some cool songs on here heavyer then GNR and probally VR but it's still cool. Also I think is as much a matt solo as slash in many ways matt has some amazing drumming here.
0316172324|1.0|I have quickly and easily decided with my first unconsciously guided impulse & gut intuition not to buy \\"Blink\\".
B000HBK3MM|4.0|Corinne goes on the path of england's sweet child Joss Stone. Both go on the soul inspired on 70's classics with the latest on soul. Corinne's album is a very happily surprise for me. It takes me to a very long journey since Til It Happens to Young & Foolish.  <br /> <br />Singles Put Your Record On and the melodic Like A Star are the best presentation cards that she might wanna give to the public but she has interesting lyrics and a soulful voice which I personally love. Songs like Butterfly and Breathless are awesome in everyway you hear. A warning: If you don't like R&B on it's soulful format then don't get this. This album is pure soul, music and classic drums/guitars beats.  <br /> <br />What I don't like (nobody's perfect) her voice usually fades away on the ends of the sentences so I can't hear clearly what she's trying to tell or at least what are the lyrics like and her high notes on songs like Put Your Record On are so pushed and naturally doesn't go allong on them. But it's alright cuz the songs makes you forget about this techincal difficulties. Hope the next album be so different on that aspect! Good Music. It's totally worth it.
B000EGDC0A|3.0|With the release of Supernature, it is obvious that Goldfrapp are concerned mainly with winning over new fans who hadn't previously heard of them before. Upon first listen, these songs immediately grab you with the plethora of hooks and catchy vocals this album displays. After repeated listens, however, these songs begin to lose their initial allure. I own all three Goldfrapp albums, and this album definitely ranks lowest. Although boasting tighter production and more (but not much more) PR, it is no substitute for the creativity and beauty that Goldfrapp's music showcased on Felt Mountain and Black Cherry.  <br /> <br />This is not a bad album, it's just not a very original album. This is Goldfrapp Lite.
B0002858YS|5.0|Heard them on the oc season 2 show, and loved mr brightside so i gave the album a go...wasnt really appealing to me at first but u just gotta keep listenin to it and u'll end up singing these songs over and over again. <br /> <br />01.

B000002UHG|3.0|Being a diehard Pink Floyd fan I wanted to have all of the solo albums by its members as well. <br /> <br />The first thing to note for anyone interested in this album is that it *DOES* have its good moments, and those make this album worth having. However, between good songs the album lacks power, doesn't really grab you and kind of feels like one run-on song throughout.  <br /> <br />The atmosphere is very depressing on this album, as it deals with depression you would expect that, but this is really a downer, you won't feel any happier after listening to it, but if you are depressed you could definitely identify with the emotional themes. <br /> <br />This album sounds almost nothing like Pink Floyd, also. So if you are searching for that \\"lost\\" Pink Floyd album out there, Broken China is not what you are looking for. But, if you are interested in hearing other sides to the members that made up that legendary band then pick this up so that you can indeed say that you've heard it all. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is more for the avid completist Pink Floyd fan than anyone else. It's not the type of album you'd play for your friends to get them interested in Pink Floyd music, it's more a listen-to-on-your-own album. <br /> <br /> <br />The tracks that make this worth having are: <br /> <br />Night of a Thousand Furry Toys: This track has a good beat to it and while dark, it's probably the most attention-getting track on the album. Enjoyable. <br /> <br />Runaway: More good beats here, a full instrumental with good bass. <br /> <br />Dark Cloud: A nice sonic landscape with climactic moments. <br /> <br />Far From The Harbour Wall: Reminiscent of Furry Toys, has more good beats..though the singing is rather out of time with the instrumentation, still great though. <br /> <br />Reaching for the Rail: Duet between Sinead O'Connor and Wright, has good vocal harmonies though the music is somewhat weak. <br /> <br />Along The Shoreline: Musically strong, similar feel to Harbour Wall, vocals are weak. <br /> <br />Breakthrough: Perhaps the best track on the album, and the only one that actually manages to uplift you. Sung once again by O'Connor, the vocals are beautiful, and so is the accompanying music. Between this and \\"Furry Toys\\" the best two tracks on the album. Fantastic song worthy of putting on your iPod. <br /> <br /> <br />So....if you are wanting to be captivated and riveted for an entire album the way you were when listening to Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here, this album will not provide. But if you can get past the weak parts....and focus on the highlights, then go ahead and purchase this for your collection.
B000301YY8|5.0|First, if you haven't seen his concert currently playing on AOL Music, then you're missing out. So if you're hesitant because of the song clips, they sound even better live. Because seeing that concert made me appreciate his material even more. I've had this album since February and this guy is just spectacular. If he doesn't win Best New Artist at the Grammys in 2007, then all hope is the music world is lost. \\"Back to Bedlam\\" has already sold millions worldwide. Sadly, we were late to the party. Secondly, there is no other Pop voice that brilliantly emotes with such candor and emotional gravitas. There may be better singers, but he's one of the best storytellers with his voice. \\"Back to Bedlam\\" is so refreshingly honest. At times it plays like a great tragedy with the perfect highs and lows. But see the AOL Concert, because that's when the songs really come alive. \\"Back to Bedlam\\" amounts to 10 great songs by a superb new artist. So take your time, be patient, and give James Blunt a chance.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|Firstly, Christian Bale is on his way to becoming one of this generations best actors, it was incredible watching him work his magic on this film. I saw this film  last night and it is still very much in my mind. The first time I tried to watch this film, I will admit, was difficult, due to Bale's dramaitic and skeletal like appearance. I agree with most of the reviewers here, Reznick is a distrubed, distraught man, slipping daily into his man made hell. But, I think there is another component here, how we enteralize guilt and other emotions. How do we accept our role in incidents, things we have caused, if on purpose, or by accident?  Several times in the movie, Reznick is confronted with making choices, paths that diverge in two seperate directions. I believe he is a kind and good hearted man, but he chose to run away from a situation  than to confront it. There is a little bit of us all in Reznick, enteralizing our emotions on a daily basis, not only affecting ourselves, but those around us.
B0009F9O08|5.0|I don't own any other David Bowie albums. But I've been a rock & blues guitar player for 35 years, and this album has some of the most screamin' live guitar playing I've ever heard. As far as I'm concerned, Earl Slick steals the show !!  In April 2003, Guitar Player Magazine published an article titled, \\"50 Forgotten Albums Every Guitarist Should Own,\\" and this album is on the list. Get it -- Dig it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I am already a fan of Firefly, and have previously seen Serenity and each of the episodes of the show multiple times. I used my friend's copy, however, and I have decided to buy my own to support the show. If you enjoy Firefly, Serenity is a must-buy, no exceptions. It concludes the single aired season of the show beautifully, and incorporates the same style as the TV version. If you are a fan of Firefly, truly despise FOX for cancelling the show, and want Firefly to come back, buy Serenity and Firefly just to support Joss Whedon and his crew. I love this movie!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I have been reading the reviews on here and to the one and two star ratings I say, I think you missed the point. Sufjan is not trying to wow anyone, he's not trying to be \\"hip\\" or \\"progressive\\" he is being himself. This is a singer/songwriter to the core. He's not trying to make people feel empathy for Gacy. He is saying that when we all look deep inside ourselves, we are all just sinners. This an amazing Cd from a twenty something artist that has been making his folky/jazzy music for years now. I strongly recommend his earlier music also. Try \\"Dumb I sound\\" on his debut \\"A Sun Came\\" it is one of the most haunting songs I have ever heard, and I have heard ALOT of songs. One thing I have noticed about Steven's music is that no matter what mood I am in, I can turn on his music and drift away. Highly Recommended Cd. Standout Tracks. \\"Decatur\\", \\"They are night zombies\\", \\"Casimir Pulaski Day\\"
0553801503|2.0|So it goes with Jordan and Terry Goodkind: a series starts out auspiciously, the author makes 5x more money than expected (the publisher 25x), and so naturally they ask...Why would we ever end this gravy train? <br /> <br />But a good series cannot remain so indefinitely. I don't think every series needs to be a trilogy, but neither do they need to go on indefinitely, milking customers for more money with successive book after book about the same characters, with  completely predictable development, very meaningless development, or no character development at all. Since A Feast for Crows elects to use 10 characters, it suffers from all three. <br /> <br />This is not true of every character penned by these authors, nor is it of the Ice and Fire series. Martin does develop his characters pretty well, and often not along predictable lines. But at their essence, these are adventure stories, not character studies, and he has strayed too far from what made the originals so fantastic: a sense of timing, drama, and meaningful suspense, among other things. Action is noticeably lacking. <br /> <br />A neverending saga alone does not make something Jordanesque. It requires three or four dozen points of view, with a handful or two of significance. And it requires these POV to be interspersed throughout the book in various storylines, to cover for the fact that nothing is happening in ANY storyline. <br /> <br />Have you ever written a novel? Chances are, the answer is \\"No.\\" But have you ever written a short story? Anyone with 12 grades of education will say, \\"Yes.\\" This is essentially writing 40 or 50 short stories, except with no expostion, plot, development, climax, or resolution, then jam them all together, and call it a novel. Deposit your royalty check, do the convention circuit as long as it will pay you, and then when the money runs out, throw together another hodgepodge of stories and start all over again. <br /> <br />By now you have probably already submitted \\"NO This review was not helpful to me\\" because I have said little substantive about A Feast For Crows. That is because THERE IS NOTHING SUBSTANTIVE IN THIS BOOK. The entire \\"plot\\" (used VERY loosely) could be summarized in about 50 words or less...and that is for 8 or 9 points of view. That is 1000 times more efficient than Mr. Martin was and would save you $20. But I don't want to spoil the book for you; the author has already taken care of that. <br /> <br />A Feast For Crows has page after page after page of...nothing. And I guess we are expected to swallow that it will all pay off in the closing pages of Book 5, or 4 pt II, or 4.5, or whatever they will call it.  <br /> <br />When you buy and read this book, pay special attention to the prologue. Slip a piece of paper into it, and come back to it once you've finished the book--it has nothing to do with anything in Book 4. The book was split in two, okay, I get it. But that is no excuse to sell me something meaningless and say, \\"It's okay, better stuff will come later, this is all just setup.\\" It didn't work with George Lucas' prequels and it's not working here. Now Martin and his publisher are going to make twice as much money off something one-tenth as interesting. <br />If you want to read a great fantasy work that was split for length, read Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series (book 3 split into two parts due to length). [Also, it wasn't delayed 5 times.] <br /> <br />I have a degree in English Lit and I actually have an appreciation for Victorian novels, but this was too slow and deliberate even for me. True, this book has plenty of vulgarity to replace petticoats and excruciating propriety, but I'm not sure that crudity serves to enhance the novel. I use the \\"F\\" word liberally at home and in public, but in this novel, the slang and vulgarities are very jarring, to achieve no particular effect. I'm not sure why his style has evolved from a relatively PG story (assuming that violence is PG, which it is inthe US) to an NC-17 one. Maybe because his last book took so long to come out, that all his fans are adults by now. <br /> <br />Much like A Feast for Crows, I have used a lot of words to say nothing, and am now going to end not on a high note, but on no note at all.
0393312836|5.0|I won't go into detail about this book, 577 people have beat me to it.  If you're reading this review, you've read enough. Buy the book.  Five stars for my new favorite book.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|This was an all-around good movie. Great cast, brutal landscape, good story. Rachel Weisz is awesome in everything. Many times, she plays the strong, sort of manipulative character, which she does well. This reminded me of Beyond Borders with Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen, which was also a very good movie. Anyway, it's about conspiracy among powerful pharmaceutical companies. Weisz plays a radical who tries to stir things up for the companies and force them to take more precautions when helping people in Africa. Ralph plays her husband who is the total opposite and wants nothing more than to live his comfortable life and tend his garden. This is one of those movies that makes you feel like you're helping just by watching. The only thing I didn't like was that Bill Nighy played a bad guy. Bill is good!
B000F1IQMS|4.0|I was in the USAF and at a Norad site in New York State when I heard the tragic events at Munch in the 1972 Olympics. The Israeli team had been kidnapped and eventually slaughtered by terrorism, this time the PLO. Sound familiar? I was angry and stunned that such an act would occur at the Olympics. Even Hitler did not attempt such when the pre-WW2 Olympics were in Berlin. This movie is a remake of two I had seen in the 1970's and 1980's that chronicled the event in detail and broached the Moussad's response. This particular movie is nicely done and contains enough drama and action to keep me interested. Like other Moussad adventures, the Israeli secret service have fewer inhibitions than the American CIA about eliminating someone they have investigated and found evil. Overall, I found this DVD worth keeping for a future re-viewing.
B000002LND|5.0|Not so much a product of the video age as a founding figure.  More to the point, who isn't such a derivative of MTV who recorded a single note after 1984?  Not a significant soul, that's who, so give her her deserved propers for the manifestation and let's move on.  To hear this collection is to cogitate her real genius - not reinvention, where there is no doubt, or her video canon, which is unparalleled - navigate toward her songcraft and you'll find not an iota of proof that each of these classic tracks need be accompanied by a visual - nearly each cut a distinct classic, uneven remixing aside. It is this consistent output of pop poetry that will endure for decades, and has, outlasting the vacuous pomposity of the Mariah's and Whitney's and their yearly compendium of appalling imitators.  My grade:  A+
B000DZIGE4|4.0|I watched this full screen DVD movie with interest as it follows a good genre of war-related films in the past few years. The presentation of USMC boot camp appeared realistic, albeit sadistic. To be prepared for person-to-person combat, the soldier/marine/sailor/airman must be broken down somewhat from the materialistic American culture and reborn as a colder, buddy-oriented killing machine--one which follows orders, though. The author's presentation of training, idleness, desert training, more boredom, loss of significant others back home, the frustration of war itself, and the bizarre juxtaposition of desert warfare with returning to the placidity of home are all excellent. The movie grabbed part of me. But I was a USAF forecaster in West Germany. My Marine friends, and I have several good ones, tell me this movie does not represent the Corps well. I do not know. I was not at Quantico, Camp Pendleton, or other USMC bases. I was at Lackland AFB for most of my training. A boys' camp was Lackland AFB. I am a little disappointed that more of the movie did not deal directly with the male bonding that is necessary and good in the military. The gay issue was side-stepped, and I think that was unfortunate. Many USMC personnel are gay and should be proud to be both, Marine and gay. All-in-all, I enjoyed the movie and will keep the DVD for another viewing in a year or so.

B000002JPA|1.0|This is by far the 2nd most boring \\"album\\" ever. (Pink Floyd's \\"Meddle\\" being first) First off, the musicians. Just because you're technical doesn't mean your good! Second off, the lyrics. So cheesy. Yet NONE of you realize this. And finally, the SINGER!!! GOD is he bottom of the barrel ABYSMAL or what?! The only, and I mean only reason to buy this or the aforementioned \\"Meddle\\" is if you need a cure for insomnia. Both of these will put you to sleep for at least a month! At least that's what happened to ME with \\"Meddle\\"! Avoid not even at all costs otherwise.

0452289963|5.0|When I was 14 years old, I had what is called a \\"spontaneous mystical experience,\\" which put me in direct contact with the core of my being. I have never forgotten that experience, and what it taught me about who I truly am--that \\"my identity,\\" as Tolle writes, \\"is not the content of my mind, but the awareness in the background.\\"<br /><br />In The Power of Now, Tolle did a good job of explaining that. But in his new book, A New Earth, I believe he does an extraordinary job of explaining the difference between pure consciousness and thought. No other book I have read explains \\"the ego\\" in such eloquent detail . . . describing what it is, how it functions, and how it inteferes with our happiness and fulfillment. Thank you, Eckhart, for this truly enlightening read.<br /><br />Steven Lane Taylor, author of Row, Row, Row Your Boat: A Guide for Living Life in the Divine Flow
B000EQ47GS|5.0|You are reading this, I hope, in order to decide whether or not to purchase this CD. <br />You are probably inordinately familiar with the album. It is an album, like \\"Rumours\\" or \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" or \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\", which captures and defines the best and worst of an era. It sounds like nothing else of the time. <br />Sure, it has a little Queen, a little southern boogie, a little ELO even...but it's a \\"Boston\\" sound, through and through. <br />There's no need to address the individual songs. <br />You know them. You love them. You have them memorized. <br />You know that the end of the album gets a little weak, but you probably kept replaying that one side anyways. Or at least MOST of the time. <br />So, the BIG question is...how well is the remastering done? <br />Well, you know how some remastering cleans things up with such detail and precision you feel like you are in the studio? <br />Or they expand the soundstage that you can \\"see\\" the players in their respective position? <br />Or the studio trickery comes alive inside your headphones, making your eyeballs swirl? <br /> <br />Not here. Which is perfect. <br />What Scholz and company have done is restore and preserve the original warm sound. No more pops, clicks or scratches. No more tape hiss from your old 8-tracks or cassettes. <br />The album never sounded \\"live\\" to begin with. There are no dramatic swoops, no bizarre effects. <br />The songs are mixed as a whole. Vocals are overdubbed, guitars are processed...this is not an attempt at reality, this is rock and roll fantasy. <br />And as such, it works phenomenally well. The instruments are warm and clear. The vocals soar operatically. <br />You'll sing along in your car or on your iPod in embarrassing fashion, and you'll air-guitar about half a dozen times. You won't be able to resist. <br />You'll recall all the fun you had in the seventies, and none of the bad fashion or haircuts. <br />Time to buy now. Have a nice day!
0440178002|4.0|I enjoyed this novel. I could hardly put it down. The story is deep, captivating, exotic, sometimes visceral, and even perhaps erotic.  <br /> <br />The problem that I found with the book is the ending. I do not wish to spoil it for anyone, but it's a \\"non-event\\". It's as if Clavell just decided after 1600 pages of writing that he was done. Everything that the story builds to is summed up in a paragraph on the last page. I felt quite unfulfilled by it all until I reflected on the rest of the novel.   <br /> <br />That's when I realized the trick: Clever boy! What you assume the main story to be is not the main story at all. It's the journey. It's the life, and death, of the characters. It's the feelings, desires, and devastations... That's the story. It's really quite brilliant.   <br /> <br />Therefore, based on upon that realization I would highly recommend this book to readers (Ages 18 and up, due to some of the content).
B000FP2OPY|5.0|With the merge with the WB, I wasnt sure if it was going to get picked up. Well thank the lord it did! I love this show, been hooked since the first 5 minutes!  It's awesome, the cast is great and looking forward to many more seasons to come!
B00005JOX6|5.0|We went to a preview of the movie in seattle two days back. From the trailers i expected it to be a no-brainier comedy. After about 30 minutes, it goes very deep into family relationships, and the whole theater was silent, abosrbing every scene with laughter and emotions. I would recommend everyone to watch this movie, as it has some nice comedy coupled with a meaningful message : family comes first!
B00006GA4C|5.0|This album defines the term classic.  This album came out when I was 13 years old, 36 years ago, and the music still sounds good as ever today.  Grand Funk introduced a style of music through this album that I had been looking for.  In those early years I was forming a taste for good blues based rock, but there was nothing else out at the time that really appealed to me.  Most of what was popular and what my friends were listening to was mostly \\"bubble-gum\\" music and not serious rock and roll.  I continued to follow GFR for many years, but this alblum always stands out as their best.  Later albums contained ballads and attempts at using other musical influences, but the \\"Red Album\\" rocks all the way through.  \\"Got This Thing on the Move\\" is probably my favorite cut, but it's hard to pick any in particular cause they're all so good.  \\"Paranoid\\" is another excellent cut as well as \\"Inside Lookin' Out.\\"  Any serious classic rock fan needs...no, MUST have this classic album...just buy it and see for yourself.
0393317552|4.0|Like Diamond's other books, this makes for fascinating reading.  The real strength of the book is not so much in the conclusions but in the reasoning behind them.

B000001E8P|5.0|It is almost impossible for any album on Amazon to receive nearly a hundred reviews and still get an overall 5 star rating, yet DIFFERENT CLASS has managed to do just that.  Although Pulp has several really good albums, this is their best in my opinion.  It isn't just that the songs are musically compelling; lyrically the songs are frequently and unexpectedly complex.  When this album was first released in England it was one of the rare times when an album achieved simultaneously intense critical and popular acclamation.  Critics declared it a masterpiece, and fans bought it in astonishing numbers.  The album also is deceptively political, in that it features class difference in a large number of songs.<br /><br />There are many musical highlights on the album, but what I find most remarkable is that there are several songs so good it makes the other songs seem bad in comparison, while one song in particular makes even the other great songs suffer in contrast.  Fans will always differ on their favorites, but few will question that the album starts off strongly with \\"Mis-Shapes.\\"  \\"I Spy\\" is one of my favorites on the album along with \\"Disco 2000,\\" which follows it.  \\"Sorted for E's and Wizz\\" is another stunner.  But seriously, all the songs on the disc are at least good, most are very good, and two or three are great.  But the best of the bunch is unquestionably \\"Common People.\\"<br /><br />\\"Common People\\" is simply a great song on multiple levels.  Musically it is incredibly compelling, one of those tunes that once you hear it you can't get it out of your head, with an upbeat tempo that makes you want to get up and dance around.  But this would merely make it a good song; what makes it great is the story the song tells.  An art school student is noticed by a fellow student, a rich girl from Greece, who declares to him that she wants to learn about what it is like to live as one of the common people.  There is a definite sexual come on, as she says that she wants \\"to sleep with common people, like you.\\"  At this point you think you know where the song is going, to a nice if somewhat standard narrative of two people from different classes who have a romance despite it all.  But the song instantly takes you in a different tangent.  What follows is as extraordinary as it is unexpected.  Our hero takes the girl to a supermarket and asks her to imagine being there with no money, a notion she laughs at.  At this point the song turns very serious and dark, as he tears into her for her calloused desire to slum and make a game out of taking on a mode of life that is for others a fairly desperate affair.  He tells her that if she is laying in a bed watching roaches on the wall she can just call her dad and her problems would be over, but to truly find out what it would be like to live like \\"common people\\" would mean learning what it means to have no choices, no outs, no control.  He sings:<br /><br />You will never understand<br /><br />How it feels to live your life<br /><br />With no meaning or control<br /><br />So instead of the song of romance and love that we think we are getting at the beginning, we get an impassioned condemnation of anyone who would make light of the struggles of those who are less well off.  I know of no other song like it.  Pulp has done a number of really fine albums and a host of great songs, but this song has to go down as one of my all time favorites.  It definitely goes onto my all time Top 40.<br /><br />There are four Pulp albums that I think any serious music fan should own:  HIS 'N' HERS, DIFFERENT CLASS, THIS IS HARDCORE, and WE LOVE LIFE.  If one were bound and determined to own only one Pulp album, one might go with HITS, but this DIFFERENT CLASS is so good that I just can't imagine anyone not wanting this and others as well.  Trust me:  if you don't own this album you need to get it today.  Your ears will thank you.ts \\"to sleep with common people, like you.\\"  At this point you think you know where the song is going, to a nice if somewhat standard narrative of two people from different classes who have a romance despite it all.

1592400876|5.0|I love this book.  It appeals to my inner punctuator.  I suspect that Ms Truss would not agree with my frequent use of commas, colons and semi-colons, but we are in total accord on the misplacement of apostrophes.<br /><br />This book should be read and enjoyed. It should be read as a plea on behalf of a significant (but ignored) minority who feel oppressed by the creation of false possessive when the plural is intended.  If you don't know the difference between 'its' and 'it's', then it's time you read this book.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B00005JOX6|4.0|When I went to see this movie I thought I was going to see another funny Adam Sandler movie. There was certainly the traditional Adam Sandler humor and then....a bit more. While I'm sure it won't be voted best movie of the summer it still has great merit. There is a message about family being more important then career which isn't new. However, I was surprised in this movie as I was with Adam Sandler in Spanglish and Jim Carey in The Majestic. Adam Sandler can show some emotion and depth even if the movie is somewhat predictable. It's worth seeing at the theater. Adam Sandler fans (such as myself) will like this movie. Kate Beckinsale in NEVER hard on the eyes for all the male viewers. I'll certainly buy the DVD when it comes out. Hopefully they'll have a soundtrack to go with it.

1401307450|3.0|Anthony Kiedis' autobiography is a glimpse into the mind of a hardcore drug addict. He was destined to have a drug problem, given his early years. People who complain that he was stupid or selfish for continuing to use drugs in the face of all their negative consequences are failing to understand the mechanics of addiction. Addicts don't quit for good until they hit rock bottom, and Kiedis had several false bottoms to hit before he hit his final rock bottom. It's a very interesting existance, but he doesn't glamourize it. He comes across as a very lonely little boy, and it's quite telling that his bandmates all have wives, kids, or steady girlfriends, and Anthony lives with two dogs.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Hostel is a great movie if you ignore all the hype about it being \\"the goriest film ever\\", which was all I heard before i rented it. It starts out where many other horror movies start out, three horny dudes out for some poontang, but i think Roth tried some different things when he sent them to the whorehouse in amsterdam and showed how one of them had a heart and made you like them. Hell, the first half of the movie was about the blonde one (sorry, i forgot his name), and when he gets kidnapped i thought for sure he would get out, but nope, he gets cut up and stuff. But after all that so called gore, i didn't feel sick or anything these other reviewers called sick. The eye scene wasn't even that gross to me. I could go into all the plot twists and stuff, but if you see it you'll get the idea. <br /> <br /> <br />Oh, the kid i watched it with almost puked, it was hilarious

B00005JP01|4.0|Chances are if you liked \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" and \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" you won't be dissapointed with \\"Tokyo Drift\\". It's baisically the same formula: fast cars, hot women, minimal dialouge, and almost no plot. If you're looking for an entertaining action movie, look no further. This is one of the best action movies this summer.

0743454537|4.0|Coming from a family where things have always been complicated, I felt great comfort in listening to the struggles of the various characters in, My Sister's Keeper.  This story is not only perfect for someone living in an unusual family situation, it is a great book to read if you have sisters.  Take a step back and hear each seperate account of each of the members of the family and learn to be sensitive to people's actions and reactions when they're lives and love are at stake.
0767830555|4.0|I want to commend Stanley Allen for his review on this site.  He suggests that the closing scenes are imagined by Travis Bickle as he is dying.  They include the gratitude and respect of Iris's parents, and the return of Betsy, who he now gets the better of by rejecting her instead of the other way around.  I didn't see it that way as I watched the film, but I see it that way now.  Those are exactly the scenes Travis would imagine.  That is exactly the kind of hero he would like to be.  Respectable, desired, and the savior of a young girl who will now go back to school and be good.  It's hard to tell which he would get more satisfaction from - being invited to dinner by Iris's parents or being adored by Betsy.  I think he'd pick Iris's parents.  This makes him a true hero, a clean hero.<br /><br />The interview accompanying the movie as a Special Feature is very informative but too long, an hour.  We learn that the teenage prostitute that Iris is based on is really in the movie.  She is the girl who is with Iris.  She looks like a drugged out whore, and that's what she is.  She looks like she has dead shark eyes.  I've seen lots of junkies with those same dead shark eyes.  Iris looks very innocent by comparison.<br /><br />Iris is a very cleaned up version of a teenage whore.  She is unrealistically cleaned up.  She is palatable for the movie audience but she is unrealistic, as she herself knows, as her mother knew when she saw the script.  Likewise, her pimp is not the original pimp written in the script.  Her pimp is a white man, and not really unlikeable.  He never hits her, he gives her a lot of affection, he holds her head tenderly and whispers to her sweetly, he has a sense of humor.  The original pimp in the script was black, and pimps are known for brutality.  This is almost a Disney pimp, if we can imagine such a thing.<br /><br />As for Travis Bickle, he's nuts.  You want to root for him, but you can only do that to a point because he is nuts.  He is extremely well played by DeNiro.<br /><br />I thought that Travis took Betsy to a dirty movie because he is stupid, not realizing that it is inappropriate for a first date with a respectable girl, but the interview explained that Travis wanted to sully Betsy even though he was obviously drawn to her because she was clean.  I overrated his stupidity and underrated his deviousness.  Since I didn't \\"get it\\" the way it was intended, perhaps DeNiro and Scorsese didn't show it as they wanted to.  I can't be expected to read his mind.  That's their job.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.  I don't always recommend classics like this.  I often punch holes in them and rate them 1 or 2 stars.  This is deservedly a classic.extremely well played by DeNiro. <br /> <br />I thought that Travis took Betsy to a dirty movie because he is stupid, not realizing that it is inappropriate for a first date with a respectable girl, but the interview explained that Travis wanted to sully Betsy even though he was obviously drawn to her because she was clean.

B000FFJ85I|2.0|...but it's still a very poor album. AFI are better than most punk-pop bands but \\"decemberunderground\\" isn't even as good as their older stuff which also isn't very good. The vocalist is annoying and of course the guitars are too simple for my tastes. The bass however is not bad but isn't completely audible either. The single \\"Miss Murder\\" is average at best with a catchy but also very poppy sounding chorus. Hey, they're better than those fu**ers My Chemical Romance who ripped these guys off completely but nothing good at all. If you want an awesome album released in 2006 buy \\"Come Clarity\\" by In Flames, \\"Rio Grande Blood\\" by Ministry, \\"10 000 Days\\" by Tool, or even \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers.
B0000024YL|4.0|I once had a friend (he quickly turned into an @$$hole but that's off-topic) who thought I was insane because I like Simon & Garfunkel. His logic was along the lines of \\"If it's not crushingly loud, it sucks\\". As I walked away, I told him he should expand his musical horizons. He gave me the finger and called me some things that should never be mentioned on a family website.<br />Aaaanyway, this is a roundup of Simon & Garfunkel's hit singles, including some of their best (Mrs. Robinson, The Boxer, Bridge Over Troubled Water, The Sound of Silence, I Am A Rock, Homeword Bound, El Condor Pasa, Cecilia). It also contains some of their worst (For Emily Whenever I May Find Her, Kathy's Song), but hey. It's just hit singles. Which is a problem, because some of their best songs were their album tracks: At the Zoo, The Only Living Boy In New York, Punky's Dilemma, Patterns, So Long Frank Lloyd Wright, Baby Driver, Keep the Customer Satisfied, He Was My Brother, You Don't Know Where Your Interest Lies and several others weren't released in single format. But this is a good way to start, though I also think you should pick up the box set which has all of their albums plus a few bonus tracks, that one's a good buy! Or, if you don't feel like buying a box set, the twenty-track Best of Simon and Garfunkel is on the market for a modest price, as is the two-disc Tales From New York (which is also good).
B000002H33|5.0|My descision is final! \\"Master of Puppets\\" by Metallica is in my opinion my favorite album of all time! Of course I'll have to write a long review for this masterpiece and I'll begin by saying that this is the final album with legendary bassist Cliff Burton(RIP). Jason Newsted was good but not as much as Burton. And don't get me started on that crap head Robert Trujillo who destroyed Metallica with the horrible \\"St. Anger\\". James Hetfield voice was the best on this album and he's a superb rhythem guitarist as well. Kirk Hammet however is the ultimate! My favorite guitarist of all time with his outstanding solos are the best on here. Lars Ulrich's drumming is next to perfect and has the best sense of rhythem ever! The production quality is excellent and way ahead of its time!<br /><br />My favorite songs in order:<br /><br />1. Master of Puppets<br /><br />2. Welcome Home (Sanitarium)<br /><br />3. Battery<br /><br />4. Disposable Heroes<br /><br />5. Orion<br /><br />6. The Thing That Should Not Be<br /><br />7. Leper Mesiah<br /><br />8. Damage, Inc.<br /><br />So in conclusion this really is my favorite album of all time and if you're a metal fan who doesn't own this album but loves \\"Load\\" and \\"St. Anger\\" than you should get shot and killed!!!<br /><br />RIP Cliff Burton 1962-1986 :'(
0451526384|5.0|In my opinion, this is Jane Austen's greatest book.  Anne Elliot is a beautifully written character, and Austen subtly conveys her strength of mind and depth of emotion with the best of her skills.  Many critics have declared that Austen's greatest talent was creating characters that stay in character without getting stagnant, and I think this novel is the best showcase for that talent.  Though often not as comical as some of her other works, this novel is a beautiful portrait of hopeless lovers, and the dialogue (always done well by Austen) is superb.  What makes this novel stand-out in my mind, is that though it includes somewhat less of the social satire than her other books (though it is of course still present), it creates a very honest portrait of family relations and how filial duty can not always inspire love, even in the best-mannered of individuals. <br /> <br />For those wondering what exactly makes Austen a truly classic author, and not just a fun feminine writer, I suggest a close reading of Persuasion.
0790729628|5.0|While there are technical issues with this version, and I suggest waiting for Ridley Scott's 'actual' director's cut to come out before buying, I'd like to focus on the STORY of this version.    The good things about this version's story:  - The voice over has been removed - Scott never wanted a voice over, but the studio made him add one so that the movie wouldn't be 'too hard to follow'; I like it better without (though I've seen the theatrical release often enough that it still runs through my head in places).  - The ending is no longer 'Hollywood happy' but instead ambiguous - again under studio mandate, Scott had to add a happy ending for the theatrical version; I like this ending better, and it's certainly more true to the overall feel of the movie.    Problems:  - The awkwardly added unicorn dream scene - I've read a lot of Dick, but even so that didn't prepare me to see how this dream told us Deckard may be a replicant (as Scott indicated in interviews).    Overall, 'Blade Runner' is only loosely based on Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,' yet it still succeeds (and Dick approved of this script before he died).  It offers a good script, great story, humanized villains, good acting, and a great score by Vangelis.  Even to this day, it taunts us with a glimpse of the ecologically devastated world we may be moving towards - and that's just background ambiance.  What this movie really does is to explore one of Dick's major themes - what does it mean to be human?  If it looks like a woman, emotes like a woman, desires to live like a woman and you shoot it in the back because those in authority tell you to, have you committed murder?  Not an easy question to answer, and much more important to contemplate than an alien invasion.
0375759174|4.0|This first book of Jane Austen's doesn't have the same subtlety as her later works, but it is light-hearted and good writing.  It's amazing how skillful she was at writing dialogue, even at a younger age.  I mention her youth because it pervades Northanger Abbey; the characters are youthful in spirit, and I think that of all her novels, this one might be the most accessible to the modern day younger reader.  It was certainly one of my favorites as a teenager (though the pleasure of rereading it hasn't diminished as I've aged).  The simple and natural emotions of the main character, Catherine Morland, would seem more real to many of today's teenagers than the repressed spirits seen in so many novels of this period.  Catherine is perhaps the least 'civilised' of Austen's leads, in that she does little to conform her behavior to the decorous standard of the day, but she has an exuberance and sweetness that breathe life into every scene, and I think this carries the book.  Northanger Abbey is a delightful read for all ages and Austen fans, even the most serious.
B000056TKD|5.0|Steinberg's readily available recording is the one to buy now. The only other modern Planets recording to get it close to right is that led by Roy Goodman with the New Queen's Hall Orchestra (Carlton Classics 30366 00432), which uses orchestral instruments of the same type in use in the 1920s, and where the conductor deliberately sets out to mirror Holst's own 1920s recordings. Sadly, this Carlton CD is evidently no longer available; maybe it will be back again someday. Those who think Steinberg's Mars is too fast should know that both of the recordings Holst conducted himself (1923, 1926) are at a nearly matching fast tempo (Holst is slightly faster). In addition, Holst marked a reduced score of Mars for two pianos in his own hand with the metronome indication \\"quarter note = 176,\\" which is close to the tempo he, Goodman, and Steinberg use. \\"Fast\\" is clearly the tempo Holst wanted; it is right. Far too many people have become accustomed to hearing it wrong thanks to the ostensibly \\"official\\" versions of Boult and his followers. Boult takes nearly eight excruciating minutes to slog through his last (1979) Mars recording. The same argument holds for another frequently abused movement, Saturn, where some conductors approach an agonizing ten minutes, instead of the correct seven minutes or so, thus completely missing the \\"Funeral March\\" character of the movement (Steinberg is a touch slow here at 7:45, but still well within reason). All conductors should be required by law to listen to Holst's 1926 recording, once available on CD (Legacy 3-7018-2 H1), before being allowed to conduct The Planets. The abused critical catchword \\"definitive\\" actually applies to Holst's work here, in one of the greatest recordings ever made. Holst's own Jupiter is electrifying, the \\"big tune\\" a part of the jovial celebration, not the sentimental patriotic hymn it is so often made out to be. To sum up, Steinberg is the best available right now: very slightly slow here and there, but brilliantly played by a great orchestra, and as close to right as any you can buy at this moment. If you love the piece and want more, get Holst's and Goodman's recordings if you can somehow find them, but if you can't, or only want one, be happy to have Steinberg.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I'm an Austen lover, and a big fan of Colin Firth in the original A&E miniseries version of this novel, so I was initially hesistant to watch this film; it's always disappointing to see one of your favorite books turned into a pathetic story on film.  And honestly, I didn't think Knightley had the chops to bring Elizabeth Darcy to life.  But I'm delighted that I watched (and ended up buying) this film, because its one of the best book-to-movie adaptations I have ever seen. <br /> <br />Not only did the actors beautifully capture the spirit of their characters and represent their internal struggles realistically, but the director clearly had a brilliant appreciation for the spirit of the original text.  The imagery of the film is often dark, and the director managed to underscore the difficulties of poverty and womanhood in 19th century England with great poignancy.  While other directors of Austen films often focus on the comedy and lighthearted romance of Austen's stories, this movie captures Austen's spirit of satire without detracting from the plot. <br /> <br />Whether you are an Austen fan or a movie fan or both, this is a great film.

Middle of the Road was inbetween girl group pop and basic late 60's early 70's reminicent of so- called \\"Bubble Gum\\" , but more like the England studio bands with Tony Burrows heading groups like White Plains (My Baby Loves Love) Edison Lighthouse (Love Grow where My Rosemary Goes) First Class (Beach Baby) Pipkins (Gimme Dat Ding)  but with a female lead singer   mostly. <br />Middle of the Road could be considered a fore-runner of ABBA. The  <br />beat is there, the harmonies ring ring, the production has the blast at the end.  <br /> <br />In the end, though,this is for only those who like a period of 70's rock, who lived, loved through it, and want to keep it alive!!!
0783225784|5.0|This is the best comedy of all time.  I have watched hundreds of comedies, but this is the only one that I am able to watch over and over again.  Every time I watch this movie, I notice something funny that I did not see before.  This is well worth your time and money.  The acting is superb and the script is full of originality and classic one liners.  Look for a young kevin bacon in his first major role.  Also observe that John vernon is playing in a comedy role.  John vernon plays the college dean, but he also plays the mayor in the movie \\"dirty harry\\" and if you see both movies there is quite a contrast. This is just a wonderful movie.  Here is a bit of trivia for you... John Belushi was the highest paid actor when this movie was made (he earned a mere $200,000).  This movie is great.  Simply wonderful!
B000AYELVA|4.0|I remember watching the X-men cartoon as a child. When I was twelve the first X-men movie came out. It was exciting to see all of the characters I had seen come alive. The basic plot of X-Men is simple. The general public is concerned about the mutant population. They suggest a mutant registration act, which would require all mutants to come forward and reveal themselves and their abilities. One mutant sees this as a threat, Magneto ( played very coldly as the the villian you love to hate by Sir Ian McKellen). He believes in a world where mutants are superior and are the next stage in evolution. Magneto long time friend Charles Xavier( played by Patrick Stewart) believes in a world where mutants and humans can live peacefully. Xavier runs a school that is a safe have for mutants. He has a team he has trained known as the X-Men, who are battling against Magneto and his schemes of world domination. It is an incredible movie, which was followed by two movies that were stellar.The cast is also joined by Famke Janseen, James Marsden, Anna Paquin, and the marvelous Hugh Jackman. This is a timeless movie which will always have a special place in my life.
B0000683DH|5.0|this is the one,the one that saved the series and made the other shows possible. <br />     after the boxoffice hit of the first one,they roled out this second,and much cheeper budgeted second one and hit gold! <br />    acting like the first one never happened,this one starts with cadets training to take over the ship and kirk is going on the training run with them. enter khan(ricardo montalban as the villian he played on the original show) a superman from the past that kirk beat and left on a far off world. it seems that starfleet has a new weapon,the genesis weapon,it turns dead planets into live ones,killing everything to make the world able to suport life. the planet khan is on is to be used as a test site.khan takes control of the ship sent for the test and goes after the bomb and kirk! the action comes fast and gets better as the movie goes on. <br />       the dvd is great and has all the extras you could want. a great set,beam it up!!!
0380789019|3.0|Gaiman starts out with a dilemma for protaganist Richard Mayhew: he can either help an injured woman on the streets of London, ruin dinner plans with his fiancees boss, and cost him the relationship OR he can pass the woman by in the hopes that someone else stops to help.<br /><br />Mayhew gives up life as he knows it after stopping to help. The next thing he knows, he's plunged into a London parallel universe frought with danger and adventure.<br /><br />While Gaiman's premise and plotline are genuinely creative, the storytelling falls flat in critical points, leaving the reader disappointed. Contrasted with Gaiman's American Gods (both creative, witty and well-written), I'd recommend reading American Gods over Neverwhere.
B00005JKHP|5.0|over the years many people have fought over this movie,and to be sure this isn't the best star trek movie made,but really it's not that bad!  <br />     after the end of it's five year mission, the enterprise is being refitted and the crew is gettting her ready for her new launch.while this is going on,we see(a very good opening piece) three klingon war ships and the \\"cloud\\" which they are attacking.very quickly we see that the \\"battle\\" is onesided and the klingons are defeated,all of which is seen by a federation listening post. flash to earth and james kirk as he takes commannd of the ship once again,because if not stoped the \\"cloud\\" will reach earth very soon! <br />      while not the slam bang action of say star wars or even buck rogers,this thiking mans sci-fi tale is good and if the story is a little weak,you still get the cast back together and start the movies off with a bang! <br />      the two disc dvd is great with both the movie version and the directors cut,plus more extras than you can shake a stick at,so enjoy and live long and prosper!
0380789035|5.0|Gaiman takes as a basic premise that all immigrants bring the spirits of their gods to America when they come here, and that those gods draw their strength from those immigrants only so long as they're worshipped.<br /><br />As fantastic a premise as exists on the surface, Gaiman's writing style is fresh, genuine and ironically (quietly) funny. It pulls the reader in and has you pulling for the protaganist and the cadre of gods that surround him.<br /><br />Beneath the surface: the timeless tale of coming of age when you can't trust anything around you.<br /><br />Incredibly creative, and well-written.

B000GCFO08|5.0|I received a call from my brother about this film. He was not quite sure what he had just seen. He thought it may have been great, but did not really trust his own judgement and asked me to see it with him again.  <br />I am not a horror fan, nor have I ever played the games, but I must agree that this was one of the best psychological thrill rides into the depths of horror archetypes ever created.  <br />It seems to be using the basics of dream interpretation of jungian psychology and creating disturbing and relentless images that will disorient and keep one thinking about the movie for weeks after.  <br />Even though it is not altogether without flaws, there are some unnecessary explanations, stock dialog and over the top climatic gore - but what this movie excels at is bringing the viewer to a place of wonder and horror, where the demons that populate silent hill are our own.  <br />It is the inner journey of overcoming fear and choosing sides when the division between good and evil are blurred that makes this movie unlike any other of the genre and worthy of 5 stars.

B000024DJD|5.0|Back in 1982, Dio quit Sabbath in a huff about the delay of Live-Evil and also the fact that Geezer and Tony felt threatened about his solo album ( Holy Diver ).Now it's 1992, and it was time to bury the hatchet and reunite for a landmark metal album.  <br />And what an album it turned out to be! Unforgiving and uncompromising, it sold a ton of copies for WEA ( Warner Bros. ) <br />and is truly the original Sabbath 'reunion' album. From the opening track, 'Computer God' we are transported into a cold,calculated world where computers have chosen to erase mankind from the Earth.  This was a concept album. It's quite amazing, too, because this was when 'grunge' and all those Seattle manic-depressives were 'singing' about suicide and how life sucks ( Remember Kurt Kobain telling the audience to 'shut up!' after they applauded him on MTV? What a disgrace he was)Anyway, Dio and Sabbath sound like they picked up the day after the infamous split and just started writing and recording. It is truly a blistering and ear-drum piercing album. A classic follow-up to the previous Dio/Sabbath masterpieces: 'Heaven and Hell' and 'Mob Rules'. If you look at it as a concept album, you will see the even deeper meanings of the lyrics. Excellent on all technical levels, too. Tony's got amazing 'new' riffs along with Geezer's heart-stopping bass. A treat, too, is having Vinnie back on the skins. The drum mixing sounds alive and metallic. Outstanding! Unfortunately, the fragile ego of Dio( which he denies in interviews ) got the best of him at the end of the tour in Costa Mesa,CA. Dio found out that Sabbath had been booked to open for Ozzy's 'No More Tours'. This infuriated Dio and he refused to perform. Sadly, he also quit Sabbath again and took Vinnie with him. ( Deja Vu, anyone?) The positive result was the other amazing Sabbath line-up that occured just for that time only: Rob Halford taking Dio's place! If you haven't heard the bootleg of that special night, it is history in the making. You feel like you are there, in the front row, looking up at Halford and Tony and Geezer. I will tell you, I hope a DVD or legit CD is finally released from that Costa Mesa show. It is lightning in a bottle! A 'business decision' by WEA to drop Sabbath from their label came soon afterward. So much for loyalty and honor in the music biz!  <br /> <br />

B00028HBKM|5.0|Note: Aramaic, Greek and Hebrew with English subtitles.<br /><br />'The Passion of the Christ' released in '03 is a magnificent and powerful film meant not so much to be enjoyed as it is to be endured. It's something you probably won't watch often but something you'll never forget once you do. This is an incedibly brutal yet poetic film about twelve horrific hours that changed the world forever.<br /><br />James Caviezel is absolutely perfect in his characterization of the tortured and rejected Messiah slowly but surely moving closer and closer to his preordained death and final fulfillment of his earthly mission. Monica Bellucci also shines in her understated performance as Jesus' adoring Mary Magdelene, her face mirroring the pain and suffering of her beloved teacher with each stroke of the wip on his pulverized body.<br /><br />There's a surreal, dreamlike feel to the sequences in which Satan (Rosalinda Celentano) appears. Having the Great Adversary played be a woman provides an androgenous quality to the persona of evil that works well. Watching Satan glide through the crowded streets of Jerusalem accompanied by a small entourage of infant-like demons gleefully observing the ongoing torture and humiliation endured by Jesus in his last hours is quite Bergmannesque.<br /><br />Believer - Deist - Agnostic - Atheist? Doesnt matter, a great film is a great film.
B000EDWKXI|1.0|I had read reviews that stated this movie to be not half-bad. Well, take the half off, because this \\"Casanova\\" is simply stupid. Heath Ledger doesn't know what to do with this watered-down part and the leading lady whose name I do not want to remember gives a stilted and lackluster performance, if you can even call it that. <br /> <br />One reviewer said that the script had some help from Tom Stoppard, but I don't believe it for one minute. And the cinematography is so bad that it makes the real Venice look like a cardboard set. <br /> <br />$29.00! This DVD isn't worth 29 cents! <br /> <br />Try and find a copy of Felini's Casanova. It's long overdue to be on DVD.
B00005JOX6|1.0|I only wish I had a Universal Remote like the one Adam Sandler had in the movie so I could rewind the 90 minutes of my life I wasted watching this film.  If you go into this film expecting the wacky comedy the previews promote it as, you'll get about 3 minutes worth of comedy, or pretty much the scenes that are in the trailers. If you go in expecting a heartwarming film about the importance of spending time with your family, you're going to get a film with fart jokes, 6 jokes about the family dog trying to mate with a stuffed animal and 1 \\"F\\" word.  The cast is fine, other than Adam Sandler's cheesy, poor man's version of Scrooge antics at the end, but the material they have to work with is terrible. The most frightening images that will be seen all summer are in this film- digitally altered younger versions of Adam's parents, including a bizarre looking Henry Winkler. I don't know if they altered the actors digitally or took a 1970's scene of the Fonz and stuck it on another actors head but it's disturbing to look at. This film will make a ton of dough it's first weekend as people won't know what they're in for but thankfully by it's second weekend Superman will knock this from the top spot and hopefully out of the top ten.

B000089RVX|5.0|Now I haven't actually bought this album, but I have got all four singles, and they're all pretty awesome, and by the sounds of the samples it looks like one amazing album and I'll get it for sure. Amy Lee has such a powerful and a dramatic voice it challenges the brain to imagine. The only possible disadvantage could be that there are too many loud guitars, with the obvious exception of My Immortal and maybe another one in there. Even so, the loud guitars are done well, especially in Going Under, a truly amazing show-off of Amy's voice.  <br />Anywho, yes I've been looking at other reviews and they are quite similar to Linkin Park but only in Bring Me To Life (which has a rap insert;nu-metal) and yes, I very much agree that Evanescence has set a path for many others to follow. <br />
B00008GKEG|5.0|Each episode opens in black and white, with the young Beatles performing one of their early hits. The camera moves back and we see the boys dwarfed by a gigantic image of THE BEATLES logo and the roars of cheering fans drown out the music.<br /><br />If there's a theme to this series, it's that the Beatles really were more than the sum of their parts. Paul, George, Ringo, even John (on film) each at some point refers to The Beatles as something separate from themselves, as if they too were looking at the group from the outside.<br /><br />What struck me most about the series, when I saw it on TV when it first aired, and just recently on this excellent DVD set, was the creativity of The Beatles. When the band started, in the pre-Ringo days and shortly after he joined the group, they did other people's songs, giving them their own spin. After they started recording, they also did a few of their own numbers, and soon they were doing almost exclusively numbers they'd composed themselves.<br /><br />It was also fascinating to see how George and Ringo reacted to the prolific creativity of John and Paul. George and Ringo were master musicians, but had shown little inclination to write music. George began tentatively and eventually wrote songs (Something, Taxman, While My Guitar Gently Weeps) that rivalled the Lennon/McCartney hits. Ringo didn't write much at all until after The Beatles, and his only songs that are memorable are the ones he co-wrote with George (Photograph, It Don't Come Easy).<br /><br />When the band finally split up, the individual members kept on making music, but little of their work compared to the work they'd done together. Why? Was it the combination of their talents? Was it their youth and energy? Was it producer George Martin?<br /><br />With roughly ten hours of episodes and extras on five DVDs, you'll have plenty of material to ponder and come to your own conclusion.

B000EQ4G5K|4.0|I think the sound is ok not trying to be unkind or anything. I am happy for her making it so fast. She is attractive, she is not the prettiest but she is attractive enough. When you put on  make up anyone for a fact that makes you look more attractive. She is a fortunate girl and take it because these chances come only once. Rihanna has the hook up if you have someone like Jay-Z behind you, you'll get through. In this world it is about who you know and not what you know, nowadays.There are so many out there with talent singers, writers, musicians, sports people but they never make it because they don't have the help. The song is catchy, the moves. The vocals are not the best, you can hardly hear her in the sound, but nowadays that is the way it goes. If the public gets caught, it is a psychological thing. You are sure to go clear. She has definitely made it and girl take it because you are lucky. There so many sportsman and dancers out there who struggle and would love a donation or a sponsor for some singing,dancing,sports or models who trying to build themself to get contracts and again never make it. So you lucky, you have the contact and the hook up.I hope you will try to help others that have goals and aspirations just like you. Keep your head up and keep with Jay-Z because wheather or not once you have a power house behind you worth millions. You certainly will get through. Money talks it can make a horse fly.Money is respect and power. Keep working hard young lady.
0790729628|3.0|BLADE RUNNER has been a film that has suffered over the years. Misinterpreted and critically attacked at the time of its initial release, it cultivated something of a cult following throughout the 1980s, which culminated in a complete critical about turn when the Directors Cut emerged in 1992. Opinion on the film is now the polar opposite to what it was in the early 1980's. Lauded by academics and film students, many books and articles have dissected the film from all angles, but mostly as the ultimate embodiment of a post-modern culture. The problem with this, is that a lot BLADE RUNNER'S magic has been lost in reams and reams of literature that have reduced the film to an academic exercise in cultural studies.<br /><br /> I think too be fair BLADE RUNNER  exists in between these two polar oppositions. It is neither the masterpiece so many claim it too be, nor the unmitigated disaster many critics thought on its original release. Where BLADE RUNNER really succeeds is in its grimy and grungy realisation of a future Los Angeles, a space overrun by people of all ethnic groups, a frightening dystopia where one is not even sure if the person next to you in the crowded street is human. This is a vision of the future that Kubrick had hinted at in 2001, one totally reliant on technology, apathetic, lazy and bored, simply going through the motions. A world in which the class divide is even harsher than ever, as the rich enjoy life on the outer worlds, with the lower classes and criminals left to rot under the torrential and permanent acid rain. The narrative mysteries are intriguing enough, as is the eternal question as to Deckard's true origins, but I have always found BLADE RUNNER to be most enjoyed as a purely visual experience. Like 2001 it is a film of spectacle, which begins to falter when it is embroiled in narrative exposition. This is the simplest of films and one which embodies the ideology of cinema from the silent era, the wonder of illusion.<br /><br /> Unfortunately Warner's DVD is dreadful, with no special features to speak of, not even a single trailer. I understand that this film was released at the infancy of DVD, but there is no excuse for having not released a special edition since.  The star rating is purely for the film.br /> Unfortunately Warner's DVD is dreadful, with no special features to speak of, not even a single trailer.

B000002KB8|4.0|Black Sabbath's albums have a great mystical power over their listener: this is done through setting up a tone of unhinged atmospherics, and painting an ominous landscape of bleak visions.  On their first self-titled album, the sound was deep-and-murky, oppressive in themes, yet impressive enough to generate fissions in the listeners spine, and turn their hair white out of fright-- while they did not quite perfect their sound yet, or really distinctively mix their tunes up as much as they would later in their albums, they were still a formidable band.    The first song on the album is titled \\"Black Sabbath,\\" and is jumpstarted with the sound of lightening and raindrops hitting the ground. Its low riffs by guitarist Tony Iommi and the sing/speak vocals of Ozzy Osbourne create the perfect fusion of their style, and show why they have given the heavy metal scene its wings. While the second song,  \\" The Wizard,\\" is a fantastic tune about that character weaving spells to subside evil, and has a seminal guitar riff, that gives this song its great prowess.    The epic 10+ minute four-parter Wasp/Behind the Wall of Sleep/Basically/ N. I.B. is a milestone of all music, regardless of genre, period-- especially due to the grand guignoal closer N. I. B., which is a creeper of terror, as it starts out like a standard love song, and twists its context to eeriness in the last lyric line.  \\"Black Sabbath\\" slightly loses its grip by the forth song of the five song album, yet its still good music, but again, just gets redundant by this 21 minute mark.    However, despite the usual first-album weaknesses, Black Sabbath's debut is sneak peak at a classic band of hard rock, and is a halo into pitch-blackness that will swallow your soul like there is no tomorrow.    ****  (Out of 5)

B000F7CMRM|5.0|Stephen Gaghan is a master psychologist in addition to being a uniquely creative writer and director.  He knows how to take a controversial topic, spread it over a period of time and from vantages that involve everyone who would ever view his information, and pace a film in such away that his viewers must stay glued to the screen and soundtrack so that not a moment of the powerful bits of intrigue he is relating fall out of place.  It worked for TRAFFIC: it is stunningly effective in SYRIANA.<br /><br />Syriana is not just a story.  Syriana is a conglomerate of stories that have as a common thread the impact the oil industry has on the globe and on every inhabitant.  Involving the CIA, FBI, oil companies, Arab nations, common workers in the oil fields, children, princes, parents, spies, China, terrorists, self-martyrdom - the playing field that Gaghan gives to us piece by painfully confluent piece faults global economy, US and Middle East greed, and the pitiful reality of the global dependence on oil that threatens to destroy individuals and countries, if not the planet.<br /><br />Gaghan's method of filmmaking can be tough to follow, so seemingly dissociated are the elements of the story as it unfolds in different parts of the world, with different sets of characters somewhat tangential to reality at times and thus jolting to the linear mind.  To write a synopsis of the plot is counterproductive to experiencing the film.  Suffice it to say that every member of the huge cast is right on target: George Clooney, Matt Damon, Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Peet, Chris Cooper, Amr Waked, Christopher Plummer, Kayvan Novak, Alexander Siddig, Tim Blake Nelson, and Mark Strong are only a few of the extraordinarily well cast group of characters. And in all fairness the contributions of Alexandre Desplat who gives his usual high degree of excellence to the musical scoring, the cinematography by Robert Elswit and the film editing by Tim Squyres are an integral part of the impact of this powerful and very important film.

B00000AOUD|5.0|Disclaimer: I am reviewing the original, and have never heard the extra tracks or remastering.    Thick as A Brick is by far the best album by the second best band of all time (Zeppelin is the best).  The numerous tempo changes, crescendos, decrescendos, and transitions in general, are all executed perfectly.  If you want an explanation of the lyrics, I cannot help you, but I think that they are just a very complicated medieval joke.  One aspect of the joke is that \\"Thick as a Brick\\" means stupid, hence your \\"your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick.\\"  Ian's vocals are nice, but the beauty of this album lies in its instrumentals.  While the album is filled with Ian Anderson's virtuosic and distinctive heavy flute and Martin Barre's progressive guitar stylings, there is another equally amazing instrumental presence on this album.  While Anderson and Barre display amazing chops on nearly every Tull album, no other Tull recording that I have heard displays such blazing organ solos.  People may claim that this is just one song , but in reality it is many songs joined by brilliant instrumental transitions.  Critics may pigeonhole this as \\"pretentious, generic, prog rock.\\"  In reality, this is a definitive progressive album, blending elements of rock, folk, celtic, baroque, classical, and jazz.  This album may be the best of all time, yet it recieves far less attention than comparable recordings such as Dark Side of the Moon (another leading contender for the \\"best album of all time\\" title).  The only reasons anyone should have not to like this album are:    a.  They have too short of an attention span to appreciate something this long.    b. They have been conditioned by MTV to like simple low brow pop music as opposed to good music.    c. They are a religious zealot who is still very angry about the criticism of organized religion found in Aqualung.    d. They spend so much time focusing on lyrics that they will think too hard and be too confused tolisten to the brilliant music.    e. They are rock purists who feel that everything must be loud and electric to be good.    f. They are purists of some other genre, such as jazz.    If none of those reasons are true of you, by all means, buy this album!
B00000IREA|5.0|\\"Barbarella\\" next to \\"Cat Ballou\\" has to be Jane Fonda's signature film. What's amazing about both of those movies is that Fonda is playing the same role as the boot-wearing, gun-loaded, desperado heroine (even though they're in different genres) and they may be the two deepest roles that she's ever played. Looking through the still photos to this film Fonda's performance is almost like Dustin Hoffman in \\"The Graduate\\": It was a lightingbolt of a role that cascades on not only the movies, but pop culture in the late-60's. I agree with Jeff from Portland: The picture on the DVD is great and I believe this film needs to be re-released and be loaded with special features. There are two things I take notice on this: How great it looks (for which I have gone over) and the costumes. Out of all the costumes that Fonda wears the one that I'm floored by is the one where she wears a white unitard with breastplated armor and a black cloak wrapped at the back, a red utility breif belt, and black boots with the red stripe down the middle (not only that but it came with red fold-down crowns on the top of the boots; creating a stirup look like you would see on a baseball uniform). Seriously, should that unitard be in leather and not in cotton/spandex? Given the fact that it would be torn up in the scene between Fonda and the birds. On a personal note, I'm getting sick of hearing most of these reviewers here still badmouthing Fonda for what she did against Vietman. Those people should get a life (not to mention a brain) and realize that Muhammad Ali did the same thing and he almost went to jail and couldn't fight for two years while Fonda was no where near there. Where's the outrage in that? Anyway, back to the movie. I think it deserves to be a sci-fi classic while it has to come out as a Special Edition DVD. I know because I think the trailer to this film made me breathless.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|1983's \\"The Final Cut\\" remains a most controversial Pink Floyd album to this day. The follow-up release to their 1979 mega-smash, \\"The Wall,\\" and representing Roger Waters' last musical statement with the band, \\"The Final Cut\\" was the album that broke up the Floyd (well, the classic line-up anyway). There's an abundance of orchestration on this album (the most orchestration on a Floyd album since 1970's \\"Atom Heart Mother\\"), keyboardist Richard Wright is absent (having been dismissed by Waters after \\"The Wall\\" tour), while guitarist David Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason are reduced to mere session players. The behind-the-scenes fighting between Waters and Gilmour during the making of this album is legendary, and it didn't sell particularly well by Floyd standards (peaking at #7). Fans were (and are) heavily divided about it, and, as the album is credited to \\"Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd,\\" debate still rages on as to whether or not \\"The Final Cut\\" is really, truly Pink Floyd, or just a Roger Waters solo album in disguise. And the planned tour for \\"The Final Cut\\" never materialised either, which only made many Floyd fans forget about the album that much quicker.But really, let's put all of that aside. Speaking for myself, I *totally* accept \\"The Final Cut\\" as a Pink Floyd album, and it's a brilliant, beautiful Floyd album at that. Written in memory of his father who died in World War II, it's got some of the most powerful, haunting music & lyrics that Waters has ever written, not to mention his most heartfelt vocals ever recorded (and fine bass-playing too, of course). And while Gilmour and Mason weren't allowed by Waters to contribute much to \\"The Final Cut,\\" when they DO appear, they're in top form, both serving up excellent guitar and drum parts, respectively. And the album really does have a marvelous atmosphere to it, with great sound effects enhanced by the use of a process called holophonics (you can especially hear the difference when you listen on headphones). Memorable songs include \\"Your Possible Pasts,\\" \\"One Of The Few,\\" \\"The Gunners Dream,\\" \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home,\\" the title song, and the awesome rock of \\"Not Now John\\" (featuring Gilmour on vocals with Waters). It's still sad that Waters quit Pink Floyd after \\"The Final Cut,\\" as he & Gilmour couldn't stand each other anymore by this point. Gilmour & company soldiered on without him for two more albums, and they both sold great and the tours were also very successful, but the band just wasn't the same anymore, and the music left something to be desired---namely, Roger Waters. Even if \\"The Final Cut\\" wasn't a big seller, it is unquestionably an artistic triumph for both Waters AND Pink Floyd. Granted, there's nothing to \\"space out\\" to on \\"The Final Cut,\\" so if you only like Pink Floyd for the \\"Far out, man\\" quality of their earlier music, you may be disappointed with this one. But if you also happen to like them for their phenomenal songwriting, music, and craft, then chances are you will thoroughly enjoy this buried treasure from Pink Floyd. Do give \\"The Final Cut\\" a listen.
0312330537|5.0|This is a beautifully written novel (memoir really).  If you've never been to India, like me, the writing gives you the sense that you're there tasting, smelling, seeing, and living it all. If you have been to India, this book will take you back and show you places you probably never saw (and thankfully so in many cases). You'll fall in love with all of the characters in their complexity and humanity.  A wonderful, wonderful read.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Wow. Just...wow. Talk about showing full-blown, open contempt for one's own fans and film history in general. The ludicrous idea of releasing sub-par LASERDISC transfers from 1993 as BONUS features, while the subpar tinkertoy CGI-bastardized releases from yesteryear pose as the \\"main events\\", all the while everyone KNOWS that the restored crystal-clear footage is available for transfer as we speak, is a truly shameful and cynical way to treat your own fans, not to mention these milestones of cinema history. Everything, even the shoddy, fifth-grader photoshopped cover images screams \\"cheap & stingy\\" I mean, look at these ridiculous covers. So far, this is the most brazen attempt by George Lucas to cash in on his fans. This is just disgusting. Boycott this travesty.
B000EWBNMS|4.0|Looks like a great show so far but there are NO English Subtitles as it says there are in the DVD Features. I would think subtitles would be a pretty standard feature - producers of these DVDs are just lazy I guess... <br />
1881273156|5.0|This is an awesome book. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I normally read a few books at once, but for this one I exclusively read it until I was done. Then I went back and read parts of it again.  My husband and I were both working so hard to please each other and show each other love, and I can see it so clearly after reading the book.  We were both showing love in our own language almost exclusively, and therefore were not completing the needs of the other.  I highly recommend this book for every person as the information applies to all of our relationships including parents, children, friends, co-workers and enemies.  People offer up clues all of the time about their preferred love languages, and once you've read the book, you'll be able to interpret them.
1400079179|4.0|A lot has been said and told about this book, A LOT! So whatever I say now will certainly seem like cliche. However I must say that all the shouting around has done enough to make this book a NYT bestseller. This is just a wonderfully crafted book which has something for everyone and I really mean EVERYONE. Be it codes and ciphers or be it the famous Grail theory or br it the \\"greatest cover-up in history\\". Once you've removed all that you've previously heard about about the book, this will be one of the most pleasureable reads you've ever had.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I bought this album the day it came out in the UK which was the 8th of May, so I have had a plenty long time to listen to it. <br />So im going to give a rating out of ten for each song. <br />Jupiter: Overal grade: 8.4/10 <br />1. Dani California - 7/10 <br />2. Snow (Hey Oh) - 9/10 <br />3. Charlie - 8/10 <br />4. Stadium Arcadium - 9/10 <br />5. Hump De Bump - 9/10 <br />6. She's Only 18 - 7/10 <br />7. Slow Cheetah - 8/10 <br />8. Torture Me - 10/10 <br />9. Strip My Mind - 7/10 <br />10. Espeicially In Michigan - 10/10 <br />11. Warlocks - 7/10 <br />12. C'mon Girl - 8/10 <br />13. Wet Sand - 10/10 <br />14. Hey - 6/10 <br /> <br />Mars: Overal grade: 8.8/10 <br />1. Desecration Smile - 10/10 <br />2. Tell Me Baby - 10/10 <br />3. Hard To Concentrate - 5/10 <br />4. 21st Century - 8/10 <br />5. She Looks To Me - 8/10 <br />6. Readymade - 6/10 <br />7. If - 10/10 <br />8. Make You Feel Better - 10/10 <br />9. Animal Bar - 9/10 <br />10. So Much I - 8/10 <br />11. Storm In A Teacup- 10/10 <br />12. We Believe - 9/10 <br />13. Turn It Again - 9/10 <br />14. Death of A Martian - 9/10 <br /> <br />So overal I think Mars is better, but only just, maybe if Jupiters song where reordered to a differant song order, I would like it more. <br />But there is no flaws on this album, only \\"Hey\\" and \\"Hard To Concentrate\\", lack protiental and not every song on here has to be perfect. <br />Ignore the immature 1 star reviewers, they probably have only heard the slow beat song, and straight away to hate the album and not listen to anymore off it. <br />So lets make Stadium Arcadium a 5 star like it deserves. <br />Lets bring good rock back into the charts too!
B000BEZPQE|5.0|Some people dont like this album. I can understand that, but why talk crap about it? About what that Slipknot fan said, \\"this cd is too sloppy to listen to\\", I dont really agree all the way with you buddy but i DO agree with you in some! I have to admit that Three Nil does sound sloppy because Joey sounds like he cant keep up with his drums, and it does sound annoying. To the perosn who gave them a 1 star review, ok dude, about them turntables, to you they may have gotten worn out back in '99, but it gives the band a different type of sound. Songs like Eyeless and Surfacing would not be the same without it! Yeah thats all i have to say to you guys, hope i didnt offend you or anything.<br /><br />CD REVIEW:<br /><br />This album aint at all that bad! Slipknot has a heavier sound when they perform live, cory's vocals are just as good as when he is in the studio recording. Songs like (Sic), Spit It Out, Surfacing, and others give you this pumped up feeling and just make you want to head bang. Alot of live cds are boring and dull, just listen to Linkin Park live in Texas, youll know what i mean, but this cd gives you the feel that you're actuallly there! Spit It Out contains a command from Cory to get on the ground and jump up with a giant crash of pure metal. If you've seen Disasterpieces you know what im talking about. Joey gets a little sloppy in the drums in Three Nil but still ok, gets a little annoying tho. Hope this helps!
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I am in love with this CD! This is truly a masterpiece. I don't know who Gnarls is but if I get the priviledge to meet him, I will definitely let him know that he is a GENUIS. From Go-Go Gadget Gospel to Transfomer to The Storm, this CD is a work of art. Although many people don't understand or even dislike it, my favorite song is \\"Necromancing\\". The song is not about Cee-Lo killing the girl literally, he's saying that at first he likes her drugged up and drunk because now she fits in with the \\"in-crowd\\" and he can do whatever he wants with and to her because he is shallow and conscienceless and wants her to feel empty like he does. But now that he has \\"killed her\\" meaning killed her confidence, self-worth, and confidence, he doesn't like who she has become, drugged out, superficial, and fake. His once thought dead conscience has taken over and he realizes that he now likes her just the way she was in the beginning, \\"ALIVE\\" and herself. So in the beginning of the song he is trying to wake her up. I love the way every song is worded because even though it says one thing there is always a deeper meaning. I listen to this CD everyday and encourage everyone else that has it to do the same. I really hope that this is not the last that we will hear from Mr.Barkley.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|They were cheap, and I wanted the original unaltered trilogy, so I picked them up.  SADLY they are very poor-quality.  The Special Editions look perfect (as you'd expect), but the Original Editions are recorded in very lo-resolution.  For comparison:<br /><br />Originals = 540x320 = 180,000 pixels (copied from an analog laserdisc master - letterboxed)<br />Special Editions=720x480 = 345,000 pixels (digital dvd - anamorphic)<br /><br />The originals are only recorded at 50% of the DVD's maximum resolution.  Very poor quality, and it clearly shows on my large-screen tv in the form of blurry scenes/faces.  Disappointing.
B000E5KJES|3.0|I will admit that I typically don't like mob movies, but this is one of the better ones I've seen.  It presents a more lighthearted (for a mob movie) view into organized crime.  De Niro is solid and Pesci plays his usual psycho violent mobster.  But the real star is Liotta with his creepy yet charming smile, penetrating eyes, and goofy laugh.  While the story is mostly entertaining, it is almost 2.5 hours long and drags in spots.  The HD DVD transfer is quite good-among the best so far.  While I won't be buying it, it is worth a rental from Netflix. <br /> <br />
B000EQ47GS|5.0|What can I say but the first 2 Boston albums were the first 2 records I ever bought. Needless to say they hold a special meaning for me. I must have listened to those records a million times over during my teenage years. Well here we are some 30 years later and the songs still sound fresh. Nothing else sounds like Boston did back then and what a great time it was. The memories are so fresh from those days, it feels like it was just yesterday. I meet my future wife back in 1976 (she still is!!!) when we were 12 and yes Boston was one of our favorite bands. Great times great music!!<br /><br />The new packaging is cool (could have been a little better after some 30 years) as it has a little blurb about the band and so on along with some new pictures. The sound however is were these puppies really kick you in the teeth. This just roars out of your speakers and it sounds so full and very smooth. The difference between these and the original release way back when is not overwhelming, but it's the little things that really make a huge difference in the overall sound quality. Cleaner, warmer, fuller and louder best describes this re-mastering job. I don't know how else to describe these releases other than to say they rock from start to finish. Yes the memories of good days gone bye are flowing back listening to these releases. It's like 1976 all over again. Where's my wife?!<br /><br />Boston's first release is an awesome collection of tunes. They all rock and the entire album is something special. If you loved Boston back then and still crave that unique sound today, you owe it to yourself to pick these re-masters up.<br /><br />Sadly Brad Delp has passed away recently and I just wanted to ad my thanks for what he brought to my life and the found memories of those days gone bye.<br /><br />R.I.P. Brad!

B00005JM1F|5.0|Okay, let me start off by saying, why I loved this movie so much.  I love this movie because I feel like I can relate to the characters so well.  I imagined them being in their late 30's (I'm in my early 40's now, but was in my late 30's when it came out) and I often times fantasize about doing college over again, and how much better it would be.<br /><br />That in a nutshell, is what is so appealing to me about this movie.  It is ensued halarity that I could imagine doing myself, or at least in a \\"movie fantasy\\" sense.  And that draws you in to the story.  Other details which draw you in are:<br /><br />1)Luke's character is at an offsite meeting<br /><br />2)Luke's office workplace scenes<br /><br />3)Vince's family problems<br /><br />4)Will's marriage failure (that's the world's shortest marriage I've ever seen)<br /><br />etc.<br /><br />Throwing in Snoop Dog appearing live at one of their parties, and Will running down the street naked is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />This movie should be seen by every college student, male and female, and every 30 something wanna be college graduate!<br /><br />Two thumbs up!  MC White said check it out!
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Disclaimer: This review is not intended to offend anyone. I will be stating my opinion on the movie and how it relates to me as first a Christian and now as an agnostic. I know that there are good Christians and Muslims out there who strongly believe in their faiths and that the historical implications of this kind of movie do not reflect believers today, but I will reflect on those who committed atrocities in the past. I am sorry if this review offends anyone's beliefs, that is not my intention. <br /> <br />When this movie first came out in 2005, I cringed. As a history major, the last movie I wanted to see was one based on the fight between Christians and Muslims. The Inquisition, the Conquistadores, the convert or die issue, and the near destruction of indigineous peoples come to my mind, and make me not want to take part in any viewing or reading of movies or books that address these issues. <br />A few days ago, something told me to go online and check this movie out. I read many reviews here and most of them were favorable. So, I took a gamble and went out and bought it. First, let me say that I am a Ridley Scott fan, and have been for a very long time. I grew up watching Alien, Bladerunner (one of my favorite science fiction films), and of course, Gladiator(I know that many did not like this film, but I was in awe).  <br />I put the dvd into my player and the first that struck me was the beautiful music that trasported me to another world and time. Ridley Scott knows how to frame a shot and hot to get the most out of it. The next thing that I noticed was the costumes that became more vivid and colorful as the movie progressed. The elaborate costumes were brought to life by the very talented Janty Yates; she knows here craft, and she also seems to enjoy it. The armor and the shields were all constructed for the film. <br />As the movie progresses, it gets more elaborate. The siege of Jerusalem is one of the most elaborate and stunning sequences ever put on film. I sat in my room stunned, I can only imagine what this was like on the big screen. Scott is a master of this type filming, I think that Gladiator was just a warm-up for this fim. It also seems that he went back and studied Lawrence of Arabia and perhaps one of the great filmakers of all time (Akira Kurosawa). Sir Ridley Scott is now in that elite category.  <br />The cast is phenomenal, but how can yo go wrong with Liam Neason, Jeremy Irons, Brendon Gleeson, and the emerging Orlando Bloom (I hope that this movie elevates him to the next level). Saladin was great and enjoyed the actor who played in this role. <br />This actually made want to go and find out more about him. <br />As with all of Sir Ridley Scott's movies, there heart and soul to this wonderful movie. I did not see the theatrical version of this film, but I thouroghly enjoyed this three hour plus movie. <br />Everthing seemes to work for me.  At the end of this film, I was stunned, I truly think that this is one of the best films of all time. The fact that there is much historical accuracy also makes this movie more fantastic. Before writing this rewiew, I sat down and watched the speical segment on the historical accuracy of the film. The historians state that to go to a movie and expect historical accuracy is absurd, and if moviemakers made them too real, then it would be a documentary. However true this may be, most Americans get their history from Hollywood fims, thet do not read or pursue this kind of knowledge. As a history major who some day wants to teach, I actively pursue more material on historical film. Recently, I purchased three books on the Crusades and I look forward to reading them. <br />This is a phenoomnal film; I rarely use the word masterpiece but I think it works in this vivid, colorful, wonderfully acted, and beautifully realized film. So, do not waste time reading this review, rush out and buy this extraordinary film from one of the true visionaries of our time.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I highly recommend this album.  The lyrics are stronger than most of the previous albums with music that is just as heavy and ever experimental.  I thought lateralus and aemina's lyrics were 'out there' and i see that with time maynard has stepped up to the plate with his usual humor, but easier to understand.  As with all tool albums, I had to listen to this album several times in order to truly appreciate the lyrics, the music, and the pure power of it.  Just like when I heard aenima, I thought it was an average album the first time i listened to it.  Now, after listening to it many times, I absolutely love it.   <br /> <br />Track 1 and track 2 are just awesome with Danny going silly on the drums and justin on base.   <br /> <br />Track 3 and 4 are slow to start and end up ripping at the end.  Great tracks showing the evolution of the band. <br /> <br />Track 5 is one of the creepiest tracks i have ever hear. much like the message from harry manback. <br /> <br />track 6 has their usual sociocritical and demented humor laiden into a great song. <br /> <br />track 10 has a huge tabla solo ending with ripping guitar chords and every introspective lyrics. <br /> <br />awesome album <br />
B00008BXJG|5.0|\\"Highway To Hell\\" is a captivating, rock 'n' roll experience that definitely should not be missed. I like it just as much as \\"Back In Black\\".    1. Highway To Hell- An awesome catchy title track. Very popular. 9/10    2. Girls Got Rhythm- Pretty good song, but a little repititive. 7/10    3. Walk All Over You- A great song that starts slow and builds to a rocking momentum. 9/10    4. Touch Too Much- A personal favorite because I love the chorus and the whole song put together. 10/10    5. Beating Around The Bush- Okay song, very upbeat and has great guitar. 7/10    6. Shot Down In Flames- I love the beat and the intro to this song, but the chorus gets a little old. 8/10    7. Get It Hot- Kind of like 'Beating Around The Bush\\", okay but an not an awesome song. 7/10    8. If You Want Blood (You've Got It)- I love this song because it  is incredibly catchy and has an awesome beat. 10/10    9. Love Hungry Man- An interesting, innovative song that kind of reminds me of 'Touch Too Much'. The bass in this song is great. 9/10    10. Night Prowler- A good ending song that ends Bon Scott's career with the words 'Shazbot Nanu Nanu'. What that means I have no idea. 8/10    Another great album by AC/DC, a rewarding experience that should not be forgotten. Buy.
0316172324|5.0|While people from all walks of life will enjoy this book and benefit from it, I have been recommending it to all of my clients who must \\"sell\\" for a living.  Many of the principles Gladwell espouses have been covered in greater detail elsewhere (many of the NLP books out there come to mind) but none have been so enjoyable to read and so easily understood. His notion of \\"thin slicing\\", and how it can at times provide a better answer in a \\"blink\\" of an eye as compared to more lengthy and robust analysis is right on the money. <br /> <br />I also enjoyed the book's focus on the power of the unconcious mind and the examples provided that show just how easily influenced our unconcious minds are.  Again, plenty of selling and marketing applications can be seen. <br /> <br />In my opinion Gladwell has hit another winner following on the heels of the Tipping Point.
B000FIHJLK|3.0|I have always enjoyed RB-RAINBOW.  I was scheduled to see the band with backup band THIN LIZZY.  TL had to cancel because of PL liver damage.  so, we were offered our money back or see RBR?--well we stayed and it turned out to be the worst concert of my life and to be honest RB's too.  he was playing GREENSLEAVES and all of sudden his guitar struck a horrible sounding note.  I kid you not(the look on RB face was what we call-PRICELESS).  the whole audience gasped, booed and laughed at him.  well, listening to this 2-cd set has set the record straight.  top notch performance with passion.  I only wish I would have been there.  I hope RB reads this--he sucked big time that night but not here.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain has certainly given rise to a wave of homophobic jokes, reflecting a national nervousness about the subject, especially when applied to that most archetypically male American activity, cowboy life.  Ironically, there should be no surprise whatever that male-dominated societal enclaves like the military, the clergy, and the State Department are rife with homosexuality, no matter how secretive or repressed.  But this is not even the point of Brokeback Mountain, which is not a \\"gay cowboy movie\\" any more than Jaws is a fishing movie.<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain is a love story, specifically a story of forbidden love, and the horrifying emotional toll such a situation takes.  As with Legends Of The Fall, the real hero is Wyoming, Ang Lee has given us a loving, idyllic vision of the American West that seems to glow with purity and splendor.  (Let's protect it!)  Texas does not get off quite so easily, few people know better than writer Larry McMurty how god-awful flat, dry, and just plain miserable it is.  As to Annie Proulx, (just can't bear to add that affected E. in front of her name), whose story provided the foundation for the film, what can one say except that - wherever you find humanity's saddest qualities, darkest despair, and most senselessly cruel and violent tendencies, there you will find Ms. Proulx!  That's the spirit, Annie!<br /><br />Ledger's performance is haunting; his hurt seems to rise off him like steam.  Gyllenhaal, a terrific actor with a name that's hard to spell, is also outstanding, although his western twang does seem suspect at times.  Great supporting work by the wives.  Michelle Williams, as Alma Del Mar, is every bit as injured and silent as her husband, trapped and very sympathetic.  Anne Hathaway, as the Texas heavy equipment Princess, is perfection; there is a toughness to her that's very believable.<br /><br />The hype surrounding Brokeback Mountain was unfortunate, but inevitable.  Viewers who are able to put their homophobia in park for a couple of hours will discover a masterfully crafted film about two individual human beings attempting to find love in a world exquisitely designed to deny them access to it.  No matter what part of town you're from, that's always a heartbreaker.or a couple of hours will discover a masterfully crafted film about two individual human beings attempting to find love in a world exquisitely designed to deny them access to it.

B000GCFO0I|5.0|when i saw this the first time, i couldn't believe my eyes. this was impressive on a whole new level. they completely got the hellish style down. the only silent hill game i have played was #3 so i kind of knew what to expect. what shocked me was some of the extreme graphic depictions in this movie. i don't want to spoil it at all, but when i get shocked as i did watching this, i have to at least give it an extremely good or extremely bad review.<br /><br />i loved everything from the enviroment (ash falling everywhere, milky white atmosphere) to the ending (another thing i don't want to spoil) they used CGI to its fullest potential here. if you are at all into the video games, you will like this. if you like horror movies in general, this has more then enough to keep you entertained.
B000B8QG4A|4.0|the movie is CUTE yet pretty in the sense that i havent seen this in my life... i owned it last weekend and watched it with my niece... she fall asleep i didnt ;P<br /><br />well, i liked that movie so much...<br /><br />i cant say it's the best disney movie, but so close
B00002Z88D|5.0|Alright there's a good amount of LOAD and ReLOAD songs on this album as well as their old stuff. I honestly didn't think those albums lived up to Metallica fans' expectations as far as Metallica albums should be, but with the symphony, every song on this album is pretty interesting. I don't really like th LOAD or ReLOAD era, but i like the way these songs sounds like here.  <br /> <br />I find this CD quite enjoyable yet there are a few cons: <br /> <br />-Hetfield lost his growliness in his vocals for a more melodic style, yet some songs fit with this singing (like the Load/Reload stuff and melodic singning lines) <br />-Nothibng from Kill 'Em all <br /> <br /> <br />still alright
B000F3T7RE|5.0|This is a re-release of the Emerson String Quartet's live performances of the Shostakovich String Quartets. For Shostakovich lovers this is a must buy.<br /><br />Note that Amazon does offer the original as well. This re-release, however, is priced at about half of the original. There is nothing left out in this one, so if you want the original artwork and so on, pay the double price. If you want the music to enjoy, buy this one -- at least until someone realizes that the two are competing with each other.  (Note that many people, after viewing this album, purchased the more expensive one!)<br /><br />That being said, many reviewers of this and other editions have compared Emerson's against Borodin String Quartet among others. The Emerson String Quartet is as perfect as one can get during this lifetime. It may lack \\"Soul,\\" as some reviewers put it, but if it does, then I don't know what \\"soul\\" means. Different interpretations? Yes.  Lack of soul? No. Americans can perform Russian works with dexterity. Incidentally, I also enjoy these same works produced on a budget label by an relatively unknown string quartet. I love them, too, and I'm keeping them both.
B00005Y1TL|5.0|Can't add much to the other stellar reviews here except to say, in 1992/3 when this disc got out, it was like nothing that ever came before. The tape hiss present on most tracks give it a surreal, wistful and lost quality like it had been made 2 decades previous and just recently discovered. <br /> <br />I think that quality is usually called \\"timeless classic\\", but this is early 90s techno (I wont call it 'early techno' out of respect for Kraftwerk), and because of its alien nature, it feels simultaneously timeless and otherworldly. Its sinister, trippy, blissful and dangerous, aching, beautiful, foreboding and appealing. In a word: brilliant.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|Review? Review?! Quality and really caring about providing a product the customer will actually be happy and proud to own is being replaced with making a fast buck. I dare to say that many Anime fans are also science fiction fans. My best example is what 'they' did to Star Trek. Just milk the fan for their money. Do the least 'they' need to do as the fans are already hooked. <br />So, the Australian version of this has an English dub option? Why isn't it on the USA - Canadian release? Doh! <br />If anyone buys this half-product they are feeding the greed and careless attitudes of those in charge of delivering this type of rubbish. The only one's who may have a reason to own this release is the true collector. Even then it's a rip-off not to have an English dub available. <br />What a shame...
1563894696|2.0|I did not care for this book at all. It's just a very repetitive murder mystery. Each issue/chapter is like this: Batman fights a supervillain (who are all presented in the most one-dimensional way possible here), a mobster gets killed, and various other little bits of plot involving fake mob stuff and red herrings that you know won't actually have anything to do with solving the mystery. <br /> <br />Tim Sale appears to be a pretty good artist, although I think some of his character designs are a little ridiculous, even for a comic book (best example: His Joker that has like 800 teeth). Also, I feel there's just nothing about his art that really connects with me, but maybe that's just me. <br /> <br />This book is supposed to be sort of a sequel to Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli's Batman: Year One, which is much better than this. You should get the deluxe edition of Year One and avoid Long Halloween and its follow-up, Dark Victory. Those two books are some of the few comics/graphic novels I have actually sold after buying them. And I actually felt bad for the person I was selling them to.
B000002JNG|3.0|Another Plant album = another good album. The two just go together.<br /><br />Criticised at the time of it's release for it's 'failed but brave use of technology' this is a very good album in many ways. The first track is excellent, sort of the best bits of his first two records married to the very different Now and Zen.<br /><br />The band of Chris Blackwell (Dr), Doug Boyle (G), Phil Johnstone (keys) and Charlie Jones (B) hold their end up well. In some ways this is actually a more human spin than Now and Zen with less aloofness.<br /><br />The much discussed production is good, clear and crisp but somehow now as timeless as the production efforts on his first two solo discs.<br /><br />Actually therein lies some of the problem. His first two albums were so awesome that Plant made it hard for himself. The actual songs don't connect with the X factor of those first two records. And to an extent the songs sound like ones that weren't quite good enough for Now and Zen. Extended movements in some songs tend to dissipate the overall affect.<br /><br />But still a good album. Essential for any Plant fan really and don't believe the negative hype that this album copped at it's release date. To really understand Plants solo career you do need to fill all the gaps and pick up this album.
B00005MP58|5.0|This movie is well casted, produced, directed, and the length though long, is worthwhile due to excellent acting, historical detail and terrific photography.  The scenes are set up for easy breaking up of viewing time.  The screenplay is true to Austen's most famous novel with very few deviations, and those maintain the integrity of the story.  Strongly recommend this to those who enjoy good productions of period literature.
0060839872|4.0|It is no easy task to make a book interesting. Even when writing about events of great interest, a poor writer can make an event of great moment about as interesting as doing one's taxes. How much harder is it, then, to write a book about philosophy and make it not only interesting, but a page-turner? For that accomplishment alone, Robert Pirsig deserves great praise. &lt;u>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/u> is a marvelous read that I tore through in a matter of days, so interested was I in the story Pirsig was telling. The technique he uses to discuss philosophy, a 'Chautauqua' conducted in the confines of the first-person narrator's thoughts as he takes a motorcycle trip with his son, is beautifully done and makes the book a fascinating read. <br /> <br />I'll start with a complaint, if only because the problem occurs at the start of the book. This edition is a reprint and includes some additional commentary by the author at the front. Unfortunately, that commentary reveals several rather crucial plot details, so the reader loses some of the surprise he might otherwise feel as various secrets are revealed. I'd recommend the new reader avoid the foreword until after he's finished the work, as I think I would have enjoyed the work even more if I had had to puzzle out just what was happening in the background. <br /> <br />Having said that, the book is still a great read. Pirsig's writing style is clean and evocative, drawing the reader into the semi-fictional world Pirsig uses as the backdrop of his Chautauqua. By moving back and forth from the events of the story and the backstory, Pirsig establishes two compelling narratives, which is part of what makes the book so difficult to put down. A good story tells a single tale that makes you eager to learn what happens next. Pirsig offers two tales, and they're both told well enough to draw the reader in and make each page a pleasure. <br /> <br />Philosophical purists may well complain that, by embedding his discussions of philosophy in stories, Pirsig buries the point of the narrative. I can understand that complaint, but I think it's unfounded. How Pirsig tells the story helps to illustrate his philosophical points as well as any more conventional philosophy text could manage, particularly as the book is written in such a way that it's easy for the reader to place himself in the author's place. <br /> <br />&lt;u>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/u> is unlikely to give the reader a great deal of insight into either Zen or the art of motorcycle maintenance, unless the reader is already reasonably familiar with the subjects. What it does instead is far more entertaining, offering a new and different way of looking at the world and how we live our lives.

B000F7CMRM|3.0|\\"Syriana\\" is a disjointed political thriller that seems to want to comment on the United States' anti-terrorist efforts and its fight for Big Oil profits being at cross-purposes, resulting in ineffective policies, corruption, and third world strife. The film was inspired by former CIA operative in the Middle East Robert Baer's book \\"See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Solider in the CIA's War on Terrorism\\". The events in the film are fiction, but they address some of the issues that Baer discusses in his book. And the film's CIA agent Bob Barnes was modeled on Baer.<br /><br />The merger of fictional American oil giant Connex and the smaller company Killen raises red flags at the justice department when Killen's acquisition of drilling rights in Kazakhstan comes under scrutiny. Connex asks lawyer Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) to investigate the issue, hoping to find and contain any improprieties before the government does. Meanwhile, energy analyst Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is trying to woo the Emir of a powerful, oil-rich Persian Gulf nation on behalf of his company and ends up a close advisor to the Emir's progressive son Prince Nazir Al-Subaai (Alexander Siddig). The U.S. Presidential administration wants desperately to believe that the religious government in Iran will fall to secular reformers, which CIA operative Bob Barnes (George Clooney) knows is impossible. So the CIA gives him another assignment: Assassinate Prince Nazir, who is expected to resist American pressures concerning oil, and military bases. In the Gulf, a young Pakistani guest worker (Mazhar Munir) is fed up with poor treatment and desperate circumstances, and a fundamentalist imam is only too happy to show him another way.<br /><br />\\"Syriana\\"'s ideas are provocative: Big Oil. Big Corruption. Policies that label people as \\"terrorists\\" for political reasons while supporting regimes that foster fanaticism because they are economically friendly. But these ideas are introduced haphazardly and never really explored. \\"Syriana\\" is a mess of disparate elements that leave the audience wondering when they will all come together but never achieve coherence. It takes nearly half of the film just to provide background to this convolution, which is accomplished by frenetically jumping between storylines. The camera work is aloof, seeming as though we are eavesdropping on the action. The result is that characters never engage and the stories never draw us in. Even within the scenes, there is far too much cutting. I felt like I was watching cuts more than I was watching the film.<br /><br />Director Stephen Gaghan (who is usually a screenwriter) needs to learn how to use the camera. Stick with those shots. Let scenes play out. No wobbly handheld work. If the camera is stationery, then don't move it. Don't distance the audience from the action. And more realism couldn't hurt. For all the power the United States has in the Persian Gulf, I doubt its ability to influence the succession to the Saudi throne. The heir to the throne is determined by his relation to Ibn Saud. I'd love to see a good, challenging film on the subject of foreign policy and oil interests. But I think that audiences will come away from \\"Syriana\\" more bewildered than enlightened about what happened and why. (The screenplay is available for download on the film's web site.)<br /><br />The DVD (Warner Brothers 2006): Bonus features include 3 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer (2 min), and 2 interview segments. In \\"A Conversation with George Clooney\\" (9 min), Clooney discusses the real Robert Baer, how the movie was constructed from the book, and the ensemble nature of the film. Somehow he imagines \\"Syriana\\" is apolitical. \\"Make a Change, Make a Difference\\" (11 min) includes interviews with Clooney, Robert Baer, director Stephen Gaghan, Matt Damon, and the film's producers, among others. They discuss the film's themes, oil consumption, and the consequences of oil dependency. Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, and Spanish.

B000F1IQN2|3.0|\\"Munich\\" is a fictionalized account of a secret Israeli mission to assassinate key leaders of the Palestinian Black September faction that was responsible for the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympic Games in Munich, West Germany. The film is based on the 1984 book \\"Vengeance\\" by George Jonas in which a former Israeli Mossad agent claiming to have been the leader of a squad that killed 7 Black September targets told his story. Mossad has never confirmed the story, and Jonas admits that it is impossible to know how much his source may have exaggerated, but director Steven Spielberg tracked the ex-Mossad agent down and was apparently satisfied that the gist of the story is true. The dialogue and characterizations are fictionalized for the movie, however, which makes me wonder why Spielberg cared so much about veracity.  \\"Munich\\" claims only to have been \\"inspired by real events\\", and that should be taken literally. Though these assassinations did take place, \\"Munich\\" alters motives and personalities so thoroughly to suit its themes that the film is essentially fiction.<br /><br />After the world watches in horror as 11 Israeli hostages die at the hands of a group of Palestinians who had tried to use them to win the freedom of 200 imprisoned compatriots, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) decides that Israel should show its strength and avenge the deaths of its citizens. A Mossad security officer named Avner (Eric Bana) is assigned a team of 4 men, provided with a clandestine method of receiving funds, and given a list of 11 Palestinians living in Europe who are targets for assassination. The team is set adrift to carry out its mission, officially unacknowledged by Mossad. They move from nation to nation tracking down the targets, killing them, preferably with bombs, frequently turning to a mysterious information dealer (Mathieu Amalric) to locate the men on their list. But the violent deaths of prominent Palestinians in Europe doesn't go unnoticed. Anti-Israeli violence escalates, and the hunters become the hunted.<br /><br />George Jonas hates \\"Munich\\", because he feels that Spielberg fails to distinguish between terrorism and counterterrorism. Palestinians may object to the implication that Mossad meted out justice to those who planned the Munich debacle, when actually the targets were prominent members of Black September who may or may not have had anything to do with Munich. The assassinations were intended to serve as a deterrent to future violence against Israelis. Steven Spielberg has said that his intention in \\"Munich\\" is to highlight the dilemmas and issues incumbent in fighting violence with violence, not to oppose that approach, but to caution that it is easy to get a bad result. He has invented conversations and radically altered personalities to that end which, unfortunately, leave Avner and his comrades without a shred of credibility. Avner is portrayed as a man nearly paralyzed by a crisis of conscience. His team members are contrived to represent different aspects of his conflicted psyche. But assassins do not have crises of conscience. They believe unfailing in what they do. The conversations that these men have reflect the internal dialogues of the filmmakers. But Mossad agents are not liberal Hollywood intellectuals. They don't think like that.<br /><br />The characters aren't credible, and therefore the film isn't either. Avner's behavior doesn't even make sense within the context of the plot. He is the flakiest assassin ever. \\"Munich\\" is not so much morally ambiguous, even-handed, or provocative as it is simply muddy. It's so ineffective that Spielberg needed to explain his ideas in an introduction on the DVD. As to the film's relevance to anti-American terrorism today, it doesn't have any. Black September was a secular organization in a land dispute, much like the IRA, FLN, or Chechen separatists. Its leadership were educated, liberal, and pro-Western. Al-Qaeda are religiousfanatics with no specific grievance and nothing to lose. Palestinians will think \\"Munich\\" gives the Israelis too much credit for scruples. Israelis will think that it posits a moral dilemma where none existed. The fact that \\"Munich\\" doesn't please either party doesn't make it a good film. Speilberg's ideas may be worth considering. But putting equivocation and moral anguish into the mouths of professional assassins is a lazy, unconvincing way to convey those ideas.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2006 single disc): There is an optional introduction by director Steven Spielberg (4 1/2 min) in which he talks about developing the film from the book \\"Vengeance\\", what parts of the story are indisputable, and his intentions with the film.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  I missed Firefly when it was on FOX.  I didn't see it when it was replayed on SciFi.  My first encounter with this story was watching the movie Serenity.  After seeing the movie I had to see the show and promptly purchased the DVD set.  I couldn't be happier that I did.  The characters are beautifully written and have a multi-dimensional aspect that you just don't see on television anymore.  Firefly is an amazing mix of action, humor, and heart that is sadly lacking in the horror that is the reality show dominated network television today.
0553801503|5.0|Is this better than Storm of Swords, no, but I wasn't expecting that. Are there too many characters to keep track of, yes. Has the story seemed to spun out of control, going off on a million tangents, yes (btw, what is the story, so many of the main guys are dead). Do I rememeber everything from the previous books so this makes perfect sense, no. <br /> <br />But each chapter is so well written, almost like a short story onto itself. I'm upset at the end of each chapter that it's over, starting a new one seems like a chore, and then I'm engrossed a page into the next one. Martin is NOT for everyone. If you want good Vs. evil then stay away. Instead we have depth, and see the POV of some pretty sick people. The fact of the matter is that Jamie, Cersei, Victarion, Littlefinger and so on are all monsters. Truly noble character are few, and even they become pretty brutal as the story goes on. Is Arya really such a good person as would all like her to be? Sometimes the brutality, all the raping, plotting and so on does seem a little over the top. Except for Catylin (yes mispelled) in the last book, no one else makes any attempt to stop the fighting, plotting, murder and so on. <br /> <br />It's just so interesting, even if I know he's going off on a tangent, I don't care cause it's so fun to read. Some people have compared this to RJ, and some of the later wheel of time books middle of book 7 - 10, where truly a bore. With both the story as spun out of control with more characters, but all of Martins characters are oringinal, we are aware of the plots and don't have to try figuring them out from 1 or 2 sentanced over several books, we have original characters, and things DO happen. It not like wheel of time where, for example, Perrin goes on a 2 page book to recover his wife, doing nothing the entire time! Things happens, we just don't have the HUGE events in Storm of Swords.

B000E97HIA|5.0|This album does not disappoint.  What can I say, it's PRINCE.  First note gets your attention, then the feet start tapping and the shoulders start popping - and you want to get up and dance or at very least, drive real fast. As always, he's pure adrenalin and you FEEL IT down to the core.   He's fearless, complicated, a true master. I'm so thrilled with this record and for some inexplicable reason, proud of it.     <br /> <br />I recorded his surprise performance on AI of Lolita and Satisfied (both from 3121) and was  literally stunned.    Watching him perform anything is always a pleasure, it's like \\"BONUS\\" to watch that man move.  I also gleefully watched as he strutted off stage in true Prince fashion.  I believe I screamed, \\"YES!!! HEH!\\" and stomped my feet in joy.  GOD, we love you Prince!  <br /> <br />After I saw him, I went out and bought 3121 (and two other of his CDs) and those two songs remain my favorites on 3121.  But I melt when I hear Incense and Candles - and always whisper \\"Prince\\" in perfect time with his girls.  Yeah, you just feel it.   <br /> <br />The record is to be \\"experienced\\" - like most of his work.   The man does everything himself and is a master of all.  The only thing I can say that I'm disappointed about is the lack of his WAILING guitar that you can feel in your gut like his classic work - but no one else is doing much wailing either these days so I guess - bye bye 1980's, I will miss you dearly for the rest of my life.  Other than THAT - thanks, Prince, don't go anywhere.  My fanship is rekindled. <br /> <br />I'd like to see a new Prince Music Video DVD come out with a few classics and the new stuff on it.    <br /> <br />LONG LIVE PRINCE - True American Royalty.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Jane Austen's classic novel tells the story of the five Bennett girls and their misadventures on the way to marriage, centering, of course, on the second daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), and her great romance with Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen).  Joe Wright's fine direction and Deborah Moggach's capable adaptation are certainly indispensible elements of this excellent film, but Knightley's performance is really at the heart of it.  She brings an irresistable natural exuberance to her portrayal of a girl changing into a young woman who longs for romance.   <br /> <br />This film deserves a better rating than 3 1/2 stars, but it seems that many people compare it unfavorably to the miniseries that aired on A&E.  I haven't seen that version yet, but I urge anyone to give this film a chance and judge it by its own merits.  The cast is uniformly excellent.

It's not an album that could be classified so people who like different genres may like different aspects of the album.  Personally,  I like a couple of the songs on here and the rest I skip but the songs I like, I REALLY like.  The songs I like are CRAZY, WHO CARES, TRANSFORMER, and ONLINE.  But I could see how folks could like the rest of the album if they like that type.  Still Crazy is the best thang smokin (get that Young Dro!) on this album and rightfully so...it's very great song.  3 stars.

To be honest, I know little of their work, but I am a film buff and heard that as a documentary \\"Some Kind of Monster\\" was top notch. I was not disappointed. I saw a lot of myself in these guys; I'm a family guy, formerly ponytailed and now bald, formerly a biker and now a high school teacher, formerly pummeling my knuckles in anger and now reaching out to young folks with that same glare in their eyes I used to have (and occasionally still do, according to my wife). When I first started teaching about 20 years ago the \\"outsider,\\" \\" fringe,\\" \\"freak,\\" kids were way in to Metallica. Being a snobby wannabe hippie I had a disdain for heavy metal. Guess those kids knew what they were talking about. I bet they are still going to shows. Nice to be an old dog who can learn a new trick.

B000F6IOC0|3.0|Though the graphics were good there didn't seem to be much of a plot.  The dialog in the movie could have been better by far.

The first Underworld was by far better than its sequel.
B00005JLKN|4.0|First there was \\"Manhunter\\", Michael Mann's ice cold, clinical approach of what would later be series of `Hannibal Lecter series'. And to say this is to make a mistake a lot of people make: Hannibal Lecter is just a suporting character in the book by Thomas Harris and the movie (then played by British actor Brian Cox). <br /> <br />The real story is about Will Graham, a retired cop who comes back to the scene of homocide, because his keen eye for detail must help the local police department in their desperate search for a brutal serial killer, called the \\"Tooth Fairy\\". Graham was played by the then relatively unknown William Petersen and it is his troubled mind and his ambivalence against going back to the very technique of profiling and re-living the feelings and thoughts the alledged killer must have that sent him to early retirement, that gives his character and the movie an underlying sense of unease. <br /> <br />\\"Manhunter\\" remained rather unnoticed at the time of release. And only because of the fact that it is now officially the first in an on going series with a highly likeble classic literature quoting cannibal, it has coem out of oblivion a bit, and justifiably so; the movie is better than expected, even though it seems to be a bit dated with it's typical eighties electronic soundtrack. <br /> <br />Then there was \\"The silence of the lambs\\", the highly acclaimed movie by Jonathan Demme with a bigger part for the Lecter guy. And again it would be wrong to call it \\"another Hannibal Lecter movie\\". But Anthony Hopkins does have his moments as the caged-in psychiatrist a.k.a.man-eating monster, who drops viable clues at the right moment so a dedicated FBI trainee, Jodi Foster, could help the Department catch another brutal slayer. <br /> <br />Hopkins immediately was and still is the embodiment of Hannibal Lecter, and would return in two more movies, \\"Hannibal\\" and the \\"Manhunter\\"-remake \\"Red Dragon\\". The latter was obviously created to give the Hannibal character more time and space then in the Michael Mann original, giving the fans of the New Movie Psycho what they wanted. <br /> <br />Having said this I want to make clear that Hopkins may be synonymous to Hannibal, that doesn't mean that he is per se better than Brian Cox. Hopkins, with his hissing, sneering and his constant sardonic looks from under his eye brows, is more of a movie-bad guy, while Cox, with his naturalistic approach, was more realistic.  <br />In other words, within two seconds you can see that Hopkins' Hannibal is a nasty goul you should ignore when he invites you to diner, while Cox' version is that of an ordinary man who can easily delude and deceit without you knowing for a second you will be the dessert for that night. <br /> <br />Now there is \\"Red Dragon\\" and first of all it can be said that it doesn't have the qualities of the original \\"Manhunter\\". Edward Norton is simply unconvincing as an experienced FBI profiler, Harvey Keitel goes through the numbers and doesn't add anything to the part, Ralph Fiennes does his best being the tormented Tooth Fairy, as does Emily Watson, and Philip Seymour Hoffman has a funny bit as a sleazy reporter. Movie goers like to see familiar faces, likable faces of the moviestars they like, but \\"Red dragon\\" shows that an overkill of instant-recognizable actors can also damage things. Perhaps a cast of lesser known actors would be better so the carefully build-up tension remains, in stead of being shattered by another cheap sensation of \\"Hey, I know that face. Last year he was in that and that movie...\\" <br /> <br />But being inferior to the original doesn't mean that your time is wasted. Just watch the movie for what it is, easy degestable pulp. Good story about a troubled cop going after a troubled maniac, being helped in the process by a troubled ex-psychiatrist who again drops viable clues at exactly the right moments. <br />

B00005JOSS|4.0|I can't understand why Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock haven't made more movies together, because their chemistry is excellent. It worked in \\"Speed\\" and it works here in \\"The Lake House.\\" Very different genres of movies but chemistry is chemistry. You either have it or you don't. And what's more, Reeves and Bullock pull it off even while spending the majority of the movie apart and only talking (well, writing) to each other. <br /> <br />I found \\"The Lake House\\" to be a refreshing, unconventional (in a good way) and enjoyable film despite its implausible premise. But the focused script and good directing carry it through. Sandra Bullock is great as usual, enough said. Keanu Reeves (ghasp!) actually manages a good performance too, yes, showing *emotion*. Who would have thought he had it in him after all. I've always been a fan of his anyway, but I can say objectively this is by far his best performance (with \\"My Own Private Idaho\\" coming in second-another film to watch if you want to see Keanu Reeves demonstrate what he's capable of). <br /> <br />I do have a couple of issues with \\"The Lake House,\\" as much as I liked it. One, the premise is just too far-fetched, no matter how much I wanted to just \\"go along with it.\\" The holes in the plot are simply too obvious to be overlooked, and this isn't necessarily the fault of anyone; it's only inevitable with this type of story. And two, I found the ending way too feel-good \\"Hollywood\\" for my taste. So for these reasons I must lower my review to 4 stars.  <br /> <br />Still, I would highly recommend this film. It's certainly loads better than the usual for-the-masses-factory-assembly-line crap out there. Despite its flaws, \\"The Lake House\\" has a charm that works. And for you heartless folks out there who won't like it, you'll at least appreciate Keanu Reeves' ingenious way of keeping his beer cold! (gotta see the movie to know what I'm talking about).
1400062071|2.0|Wow, the rave reviews were puzzling.  I do respect that other readers have differing opinions and taste in books.  I read about 2 novels a week and about all sorts of different subjects.  Obviously there is no need to repeat what the story is about, but the bottom line is what an incredible bore the story turned out to be. I forced myself to finish it because I kept waiting for it to get better and it didn't.  Not really anyway.  The end was annoyingly predictable, also. <br /> <br />Ms. Strout, I've no doubt you are a good writer.  Just that this time this book wasn't for me.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's debut \\"Killém All\\" was an angry thrashing beast that displayed an abundance of youthful aggression, while hinting at more subtle possibilities within its underbelly. \\"Ride the Lightning\\", while still thrashing hard at times with grand metal flair, is a far more mature release, and is the real commencement of the hugely commercially successful Metallica institution. This is the Metallica that managed to be both critically praised for their musicianship and inspired songwriting, while unearthing their lofty position within a whole generation of adoring fans. This was not just rebellious teenagers bashing their instruments and screaming irrationally like so many outsiders would try to suggest of the metal genre in general. This was intelligently crafted music, with genuine themes (the death sentence, suicide, even Egyptian based) and creatively fashioned tracks with varying tempos and feel. It's an extremely important album in Metallica's history and an extremely important album in metal history itself.    \\"Ride the Lightning\\" has lost none of its power today, over 20 years after its release. The title track, \\"Fade to Black\\", \\"Creeping Death\\" and \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" are simply some of the band's finest tracks, all being part of the band's staple live set for years to come. The only thing that stops \\"Ride the Lightning\\" from being my personal favourite Metallica release are the slightly less drool inducing \\"Trapped Under Ice\\" and \\"Escape\\". Yet even those tracks are far superior to anything the band has released in about the last 15 years.    James, Kirk, Lars and Cliff made history with this album and no metal fan should be without it. It's one of those exceptionally rare moments where a few individuals can join so seamlessly, all playing a vital role and fulfilling a vision in unity. An undeniable classic.
B000002J1L|5.0|When Genesis released From Genesis to Revelation in 1969, it was hard to believe that they would drastically change their sound, and for the better. That debut was basically a pop album. But the band wanted to move beyond the song-oriented pop format and comes Trespass late the following year. That was certainly the step in the right direction, as the band moved from Decca to Charisma, changed producers from Jonathan King to John Anthony, and exploring the new prog rock sound. But of course the band needed a more stable lineup and a permanent drummer (they already went through John Mayhew, John Silver and Chris Stewart). Anthony Phillips couldn't continue on because of stage fright (although he did get a solo career going in the late '70s, and I highly recommend 1977's The Geese & the Ghost to those who enjoy Trespass, as that album emphasizes the more pastoral side of Trespass). Steve Hackett was this new guitarist, he was already in a band called Quiet World, who released an album in 1970. Phil Collins was this new drummer, he was in a group called Flaming Youth, who released an album in 1969 called Ark 2. That meant the classic lineup of Gabriel/Collins/Banks/Rutherford/Hackett was now reality. <br /> <br />Trespass had a more mellow and reflective sound, for the most part, with only \\"The Knife\\" allowing the band to rock out. Nursery Cryme certainly improved on the Trespass sound, having a more rocking sound overall, but the acoustic passages weren't too far off from what Phillips did on Trespass. The album opens up with \\"The Musical Box\\", which is a truly wonderful piece that alternative between more aggressive and heavy passages, and more mellow passages. \\"For Absent Friends\\" is a short acoustic piece, and the earliest Genesis song with Phil Collins taking lead. Then comes the next prog epic, \\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\\", which includes lots of great interesting and creative passages. The band then had a more humorous side with \\"Harold the Barrel\\", which is pretty straightforward. \\"Seven Stones\\" proves that even a short song can make great prog, and the presence of Mellotron sure benifitted. \\"Harlequin\\" is a nice, gentle acoustic ballad, I can't see why this song often gets bashed, because I think it's great. The last song, \\"The Fountain of Salmacis\\" ends the album with a band with more great Mellotron use and great guitar solos from Steve Hackett. <br /> <br />Many people believed that Peter Gabriel started exploring costumes by this point. He hadn't. I saw footage from this time period of the band performing \\"The Fountain of Salmacis\\" and Gabriel still wasn't wearing any masks or costumes. It wasn't until around Foxtrot that Gabriel started getting in to costumes. <br /> <br />If you had any doubts with Trespass, Nursery Cryme certainly pointed these guys in the right direction, and many people regard this as one of their finest, and I can't disagree with them. After hearing too much '80s Genesis like Invisible Touch, Nursery Cryme is sure a breath of fresh air for me. Truly recommended to all prog rock fans.
B000F3AAUW|2.0|The rating is for the entire album. I almost gave it one star, but \\"Crazy\\" is the catchiest thing I've heard in over a year & deserves much better supporting material than the junk on here. I'm so disappointed...I really wanted to find some hidden gem, but after having it play constantly in my car for the last week, nothing as yet has jumped out of my speakers. <br /> <br />It's called inspiration flowed for three minutes & needed some filler to justify a cd length release.  A lot of the lyrics for other songs are creepy (but not in any cathartic good way.) And the beats (sans Crazy)are pretty lame too.  I borrowed my roommates copy & sure am glad I didn't spend my own 10 bucks. <br /> <br />Not many people are able to make an album that's consistently good beginning to end. Who knows why the muse can depart just as quickly as it arrives?
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I totally get lost in this album in that it takes you to another dimension in time, somewhere deep within The Chili Pepper's Souls and your own soul.  Well written, well played and well Produced.  This may be John Frusciante's best playing that I've had the pleasure of hearing!  Haunting melodies and words.  EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000957O82|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />In \\"Hitch,\\" Will Smith plays a modern-day Henry Higgins, who, for a tidy fee, will teach lessons of love to a bunch of lovelorn Eliza Doolittles - only, in this case, the Elizas are grown men who desperately need instruction on how to win the hearts and affections of the women of their dreams. Of course, the irony is that Hitch doesn't adhere to his own formula, being a confirmed bachelor with no interest in entering into a serious relationship with anyone himself. Until, that is, he meets the woman of his own dreams, Sara, a New York City gossip columnist who has no idea what it is Hitch does for a living.<br /><br />It occurs to me that, when it comes to certain movie genres - action movies and romantic comedies in particular - it would be helpful if we could inflict some kind of temporary amnesia on ourselves so that we could at least think we were watching something new and fresh and not something we've already seen a hundred times before. Even the best romantic comedies can't entirely avoid paying homage to \\"the formula,\\" and \\"Hitch\\" is clearly no exception. As such, the film has some mildly amusing moments, some endearingly sweet scenes, and some cute little plot complications amidst all the sentimental clich&eacute;s, lowbrow slapstick and tired stereotypes we generally find in these films. (I mean, do we really need yet another romantic comedy in which one of the heroine's co-worker sidekicks is a light-in-the-loafers, preposterously effeminate gay man?). It seems like every time \\"Hitch\\" is about to win us over, it short circuits itself and loses us by going for the obvious.<br /><br />Smith makes for a smooth romantic lead, but Eva Mendes doesn't always seem up to the challenge of her role, particularly when she is called upon to convey dramatic intensity. Actually, of the performers, it is Kevin James (\\"King of Queens\\"), as an overweight klutz who has hired Hitch's services to help him woo a beautiful blond heiress, who walks off with the film. Even though he's only a supporting player, it doesn't take him long to assume center stage in the film, essentially relegating the leads to second banana status.film.

B000FVE3A2|2.0|This is one of my first reviews for any product. I guess, as the saying goes that bad news gets reported more often than good news. I like the look and weight of this watch and even the band is top notch. However, I received my watch with the little \\"Invicta\\" sign on the face of the watch broken. I guess that it became lose during shipping and it just floats inside of the face of the watch. It prevents the hour, minute, and second hands from turning. I do not believe that the watch was used since it looks brand new. Also, I do not blame Amazon in anyway for this and I am glad that they are indeed allowing me to return it. I have ordered many items from Amazon and 3 other watchs from them and I am very happy with both their service and prices. <br /> <br />In short, I do not know if this was just one bad watch from Invicta but it scared me off the brand and their quailty control. I do not think that I will be buying another watch from said brand until they get their quailty up.
B00006IUIG|5.0|First time I saw 8 1/2 over twenty years ago; I did not like it then and I did not care much for a confused director who did not know how to make his next movie or how to deal with all women in his life. This time it was different. I knew it from the opening scene, from the first sounds of Nino Rota's music. I wanted to know how Guido would balance the demands of his producers and the insecurities of his love life. I sometimes barely could tell the difference between the reality and Guido's surfing the waves of his memory or building the Utopias in his mind where things were exactly the way he wanted them to be - and I really did not want to tell the difference. I just was there, following Guido on his journey where Fellini sent us. Then, that scene came, \\"La Saraghina's\\" lurid dance on the beach. There was something in that scene that made me return to it over and over again. What was it? The dancing woman was not young, pretty or graceful. On the contrary, she was fat and ugly but there was something about her - that smile, resilience, the promise of joy that attracted eager schoolboys. It was a last time the young Guido felt happy without guilt and shame that inevitably came after the encounter and stayed with him forever; he learned that joy and punishment are inseparable...<br /><br />There have been fewer than a handful of films that affected me as profoundly as 8 ½ did:<br /><br />Tarkovsky's \\"Zerkalo\\" - when the master holds the mirror in front of you that reflects his soul and mind, open you eyes and heart, don't say a word, just watch closely.<br /><br />Tarkovsky's \\"Andrey Rublev\\" - What is talent? Is it a God's gift or Devil's curse? Is an Artist free in choosing what to do with that gift?<br /><br />Bergman's \\"Persona\\" - How far can one individual go in opening his soul to the other without losing identity and sanity?<br /><br />Fellini's -\\"Nights of Cabiria\\" - \\"Dum Spiro - Spero\\" - While there's life there's hope.<br /><br />In 8 ½, Fellini explored all these subjects and in the final he took the idea of life and hope ever further: after all the characters in his film disappear from the screen, all what left behind is \\"a little orchestra of Hope with Love as its conductor\\". The last that we hear is the magic music of Rota, bringing affirmation, hope and love.<br /><br />Simply wonderful. Perhaps, one of five greatest films ever made.ini explored all these subjects and in the final he took the idea of life and hope ever further: after all the characters in his film disappear from the screen, all what left behind is \\"a little orchestra of Hope with Love as its conductor\\".

B000EMGAOY|4.0|Stadium Arcadium is a musical delight. Every time you listen to it you hear something new.  Put on the headphones and you get an even different effect. The great thing about the Red Hot Chili Peppers is that they never try to capture lightning in a bottle, they just create new lightning.  In other words, SA is not like By the Way is not like Californication is not like BSSM...you get the idea.  They boldly try new sounds and new styles; all the while still remaining familiarly Chili Peppery. <br /> <br />While Anthony Kiedis will never be mistaken for Andrea Bocelli, his vocals are quite good top to bottom exploring different ranges and styles of singing/rapping, so called. John Frusciante's background vocals are extraordinary and in some places, Kiedis and Frusciante give Simon and Garfunkel an alternative rock run for their money. <br /> <br />Flea's bass never really runs you over on any of the tracks but that turns out to be a good thing. The basslines are everpresent adding so much color to the songs in such a subtle but important way.  The headphone listen really accentuates Flea's inextricable contribution to these songs. It is a credit to Flea that his ego isn't such where he needs to put the bass in your face; but he is content to lend his craft to making each song the best it can be. <br /> <br />Frusciante however truly seems to drive the train when it comes to the RHCP sound.  Since his return to the band, By the Way and Californication had a clean and undistorted guitar sound for the most part that stayed fairly consistent throughout the records. But on SA, not only is there distortion added to the mix, but every other sound that you could imagine a guitar could make as well. He has everything from fast finger speed solos to long sustaining one note solos and everything in between. Not to mention his magical ability to beautifully string chords together. <br /> <br />This is, of course, a 28 song double CD lasting more than 2 hours. You wouldn't know itthough. Very few dead spots if any. I enjoy every minute of Stadium Arcadium and a couple hours will get by you fast when you listen. <br /> <br />Lastly, I hate when RHCP fans and others get angry because the new record doesn't sound like Blood Sugar Sex Magik. They already made that record so why make it again?. Stadium Arcadium sounds like Stadium Arcadium...and thank god...it's a terrific trip to Mars and Jupiter. I'll be going back often. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|For those fans that have been listening to her for the past 20 years such as myself, you will probably agree that this is the best album since \\"Ray of Light\\". I am so glad she decided to team up with Stuart Price instead of Mirwais like her last two albums, and I hope she continues to use producers like Price or similar. I like that this album you can hear her voice and it is not masked by vocal effects as in \\"Music\\" and \\"American Life\\". Some of my favorites: Hung Up, GET TOGETHER is awesome, Jump, and Like It Or Not. On \\"Jump\\", the first couple of vocals when she is singing, you're instantly taken back to her Erotica album and listenening to \\"Where Life Begins\\". <br />For those reviewers saying she is \\"tired\\" and \\"boring\\", well obviously some people aren't tired of her boring music because she is continuously selling out venue after venue on her current summer tour. P.S. If you have a chance, you MUST see her in concert, it is definitely a feast for the eyes and ears! <br />
0671449028|3.0|Clever story and rhymes, but my 2-year old has never been interested in this book. We received it as a gift when he was born and it was one of my (Mom) personal favorites. But he has always strongly preferred books with photographs over illustrations, and he's not quite old enough to appreciate the story. Maybe he'll get into it later on.
B00005JOIH|5.0|I remember some of the controversy over Steven Spielberg's newest film entitled \\"Munich\\" when it was quietly released to theatres. After finally getting to see it recently, I have to honestly say that \\"Munich\\" is an incredibly well-done but ultimately thought-provoking movie and ranks among the most `out of the blue' films of Spielberg's career and yet another home run from him and his crew.<br /><br /> It is the 1972 Summer Olympics in the city of Munich in southeastern Germany. The games go smoothly and joyously until on September 9, a vicious band of terrorists who call themselves the Black September, take eleven Israeli athletes hostage.
B0002858YS|4.0|I honestly wanted to hate The Killers. Here we have another band copping a retro sound, with a name that begins with \\"The\\" and ends in \\"S.\\" Haven't we had enough bands like this? However, The Killers stand out from the pack, for they have jammed their debut with enough catchy, memorable pop-rock tunes that will appeal to just about everyone. This isn't a CD designed to please the editors of Spin and Rolling Stone magazine alone. \\"Hot Fuss\\" is, quite simply, a well-rounded, diverse album that warrants repeated play.<br /><br />Well, you've heard the hits so far. \\"Somebody Told Me\\" \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and \\"All These Things I Have Done\\" have all done their time on both the radio and MTV and made these guys a near household name. If you don't own it already, you're probably wondering if the rest of \\"Hot Fuss\\" holds up. Well, it does. \\"Andy You're A Star\\" and \\"Change Your Mind\\" both easily could have been the next singles, while the narrative of darker songs like \\"Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine\\" takes the album well above simple pop-appeal. Basically, if you're looking for something a little accessible, this will please you. However, if you are looking for something that is a little left of center, give \\"Hot Fuss\\" a chance. They may be one of the most overexposed bands of the decade, but The Killers at least prove they can always write a great radio hit while retaining an original sound.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|Amazon sent me a French version of this movie! You can switch to English but then subtitles appear. Turn off the subtitles but they come on again as soon as the chapter changes. Argghhh! <br /> <br />I can't turn off the subtitles at all watching DTS. <br /> <br />A total waste of money. I don't think I will buy DVD's from Amazon again.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|You can always count on the Foo Fighters to deliver good music everytime an album comes around, and this, their ambitious two-disc set, is no exception. While it may not be the definitive Foo's release, \\"In Your Honor\\" shows that the band is aging beautifully. Entering their second decade together as an act, Dave Grohl, Taylor Hawkins, Nate Mendel and Chris Shiflett, are showing no signs of slowing down. \\"In Your Honor\\" is the band continuing their legacy as possibly the best pop-rock act still standing on Earth.<br /><br />As we all know, disc one is the rock side, while disc two is the softer, acoustic side. Opening tremendously with the instant hits \\"In Your Honor\\" \\"No Way Back\\" \\"The Best Of You\\" and \\"D.O.A.\\" the first disc starts on the right foot, in a big way. Unfortunately, I have to admit that the rest of this disc sort of peters off rather quickly. Songs like \\"The Last Song\\" and \\"End Over End\\" fail to induce the same excited feelings the first half of the disc did. However, I have to say, on the second disc, there are no disappointments. While I had been hooked on what the first disc had to offer, I completely forgot about the second part, which offers up quite a few classics itself. The opening track, \\"Still,\\" a somber, slow moving number, sounds like something Nine Inch Nails would do if Trent picked up an acoustic guitar and lightened up a bit. Songs like \\"Another Round\\" and \\"Cold Day In the Sun\\" (which places drummer Taylor Hawkins on vocals) definitely have their place amongst the best in the Foo Fighters catalogue, and are just as strong as any song they have done, plugged in or not. The closing track, \\"Razor,\\" which features Queens Of The Stone Age frontman Josh Homme on guitar, is the perfect way to round out the set, as it combines the traditional Foo's formula with a few curveballs.<br /><br />\\"In Your Honor\\"  may not be the \\"Best Of Foo\\" but it certainly is another excellent entry from the band. And since you're getting two discs full of material here -- 20 songs, 10 on each disc -- it's definitely a worthy effort. Here's hoping that the experimentation done here serves them well in the future and helps the Foo Fighters break down some walls into new territory.rial here -- 20 songs, 10 on each disc -- it's definitely a worthy effort.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|I got this album for my 13nth birthday in '78....oh, my God, has it been that long? But I remember holding it in my hot little hands thinking to myself, \\"I'm gonna blast this sucker!\\" I ran to the family stereo and my dad said, \\"John, make sure you listen to it at a 'reasonable' volume...\\"<br /><br />Reasonable to whom? To other people or to me?<br /><br />I decided to play it when nobody was home...at high volume, of course. Oh, my God. I was amazed. I hadn't heard something that incredible in quite awhile. It wasn't just rock 'n roll...it was ROCK'N ROLL!<br /><br />Wherever I went, this album was with me. I was even listening to it when I was in a rather serious car accident. As my car rolled over about three times, Van Halen was still playing in the tape player. You would think that I would have bad memories associated with this recording now, not so. It is still one of my favorites and I am quite sure it always will be.<br /><br />Of course, now I listen to it at a \\"reasonable\\" levels.
B0007OCG56|1.0|By the time I managed to finish watching this movie in its entirety -- which I did in two parts because I was so disgusted after the first 30 minutes that I shut the TV off and didn't watch the rest for at least a week -- I was left bewildered and just as disgusted as when I began. To echo another reviewer, nothing was solved at the end of this movie. Like a rollercoaster, it went around in loops and dives and twists and eventually ended up exactly in the same place: nowhere. <br /> <br />Also, right from the beginning I felt I was being manipulated by the filmmakers. They practically planted horns on Deborah (Téa Leoni) and a halo on Flor (Paz Vega). And Adam Sandler's contrived cuteness has finally run its course. I used to get great laughs from his antics, but now he's simply repeating the same part: the hapless, aw-shucks, baby-talking goofball who just wants you to like him, really like him. Adam, stop trying so hard. Please. <br /> <br />Furthermore, this movie reeked of characature and stereotyping. The beautiful, proud, saucy, Mexican cleaning lady. The rich, neurotic, demanding Beverly Hills wife. The poor, hen-pecked, emasculated American husband. The boozy, free-spirited grandma spouting pearls of wisdom. I was insulted by the oversimplifications of both people and situations. <br /> <br />The final straw was at the end when Flor, the aforementioned proud, sexy Mexican woman, decided she was TOO proud to let her daughter embrace American culture to the point of going to a prestigious private school on a scholarship. No, I guess she realized that she perilously crossed the Mexican desert and entered the U.S. illegally so her daughter could hope to slave away at below-minimum-wage jobs because anything more ambitious was spitting on her heritage. Give me a break. <br /> <br />I can't help but think of the very different ending of \\"Real Women Have Curves\\" where Ana Garcia (America Ferrera) doesn't let her mother keep her trapped in some narrow idea of whatshe is supposed to be with regard to gender or culture. Instead she goes away to school and finds pride in her own strength and strength in her own pride. I wish \\"Spanglish\\" had been as inspirational, but in the end all this movie seemed to celebrate was that pig-headedness often prevails. Olé. <br /> <br />One star.
B00005JP4U|5.0|An Inconvenient Truth is very factual and strikes the chord that the general public is oblivious or in denial of global warming facts layed out by scientists around the world. Al Gore sticks to the facts and explains them in terms that the general public can understand. This movie made me want to do something to help the environment. Everyone I know that has seen the movie feels the same way. Wake up America and open your eyes to a major Global Warming problem occuring at an alarming rate!
B0000A98ZP|5.0|There was an abundance of teen films in the 1980s.  That was one of the defining parts of the decade.  Though many of those were great - and many were terrible - few came close to the greatness of THE BREAKFAST CLUB.  Since its release in 1985, it has become a contemporary classic, winning over viewers for more than twenty years.  As of yesterday, I am one of the countless viewers in love with this film.<br /><br />THE BREAKFAST CLUB spans eight hours on a grey Saturday, where five teenagers are gathering at Shermer High School for detention.  At first glance, this is how they appear: Andy (Emilio Estevez) is just another jock.  Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) is a nerd, a brain, a geek.  Bender (Judd Nelson) is a rude, rambunctious troublemaker.  Claire (Molly Ringwald) is a stuck-up rich girl.  Allison (Ally Sheedy) is odd, quiet, disturbed, the precursor to the Gothic girl.  These five kids go into Shermer High with nothing in common, but when they come out, their lives will be changed forever.<br /><br />John Hughes is universally acknowledged to be the King of Teen Movies, but he's much more.  He is a very talented writer and director, and THE BREAKFAST CLUB is clear, undeniable evidence of this.  The script is very likely one of the greatest ever written, filled with great dialogue including memorable moments of humor and shocking moments of drama.  Hughes' directing wrings out Academy Award-worthy performances from the cast - which is, of course, stellar.  Hall is probably the most likable of the bunch, but Nelson is the most amusing.  His character is one whom we hate, then laugh with, then sympathize with, then hate again, and finally, love.  Sheedy's character is delightfully weird.  Paul Gleason is perfectly hateable as Principal Vernon, and John Kapelos is perfectly likable as Carl the janitor.<br /><br />THE BREAKFAST CLUB is emotional, shocking, and filled with dialogue that is undeniably true.  The cast is great, the script is brilliant, the directing istop-notch, the editing is seamless, and to top it off there's a great soundtrack including music by Simple Minds and Wang Chung.  This is not only the ultimate 80s teen flick - it may very well be one of the greatest films ever made.  Highly recommended.
B000FA57RG|3.0|I attended the actual live concert for the Reinvention Tour (twice at that) and I enjoyed the concert back in 2004 and subsequently enjoyed this DVD, but it didn't really do the show justice at all.  Essentially this was her \\"greatest hits tour\\" although not officially so.  However, on the CD and DVD the bulk of what is shown is stuff from American Life.  There were sets of Papa Don't Preach, Burning Up, Hanky Panky and others that were cut out entirely.  I know they can't include everything, but they could have saved some space for those by cutting out that entire last sequence on the DVD of her in Israel which I thought was totally out of place for this DVD.  I grew rather tired of all the preachiness of being a better person and karma and all that spirituality.  It would have been more tolerable in small doses, but it seemed like the ENTIRE thing was all about that.  Also, her political involment is turning alot of people off (note the angry fans screaming \\"I thought I was going to a pop show not a democratic convention!\\")  Her previous tour documentary, TRUTH OR DARE, is a modern pop classic of live performance.  This tries to mirror some elements of that, but never quite makes it.  I did think Madonna's children segments were especially intriguing and funny.  When she asks her kids to pick up their shoes, it's rather striking because it really does confirm the fact that she IS a mother.  Overall, not bad but it could have been better.  Also, why did it take 2 years for this to get released?
0380820846|4.0|After reading about Colin and Penelope in the first 3 of the series I was quite sure that Colin would outshine Miss Penelope.  I was very very wrong!  Penelope is great, she's funny, she has courage, wit, and a lot of sass.  Surprisingly she was just what colin needed, it just took him quite awhile to realize it.   <br />As usual Julia Quinn brought out the best in the entire Bridgerton family making me look forward to the next in the series.
1401206905|5.0|A young police detective James Gordon has just transferred from Chicago, with his pregnant wife on the way, to begin his life anew in Gotham City, a rotten hellhole of a town where crime runs rampant, not just in the streets, but in the police force and political offices, too, and everyday life is like a hurricane. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne, a millionaire in his 20s, flies into Gotham after twelve-years abroad, no doubt training for the famous force of hooded justice he is destined to become. While Detective Gordon struggles to adapt to the corrupt police force he now works for, Wayne, who's inspired to become a winged vigilante after an \\"inspiration message,\\" takes to the skies as the \\"Bat-Man.\\" <br /> <br />Again, Frank Miller uses his prodigious, noir-style writing talents to demonstrate first hand, Batman is the most human, most believable, and generally the greatest, modern-day superheroes even though he possesses no powers. Miller, who previously placed everyone's favorite hero in his most defining of moments (fighting the NYPD, defeating Superman in personal combat, etc.) in his acclaimed masterpiece \\"The Dark Knight Returns,\\" now writes what exactly drove Bruce Wayne to leave his childhood behind to carry out a promise he made on his parents grave the night they were murdered by an unidentified mugger. This is the Dark Knight at his very core--he's just beginning to get used to his future lifestyle, and is still uncertain to what exact directions he is to take. We also see the Batman through the eyes of Detective Gordon, which gives the story an all the more realistic and human feel, in addition to Dave Mazzucchelli's dark and gritty artwork. It's tough to imagine a better story that defines the Batman character in such a way as \\"Year One\\" does. I advise anyone new to the mesmerizing pleasure of reading \\"modernized\\" graphic novels, and any Bat-fan, to find this book and give it try, along with the other two runs Miller has done on the dark avenger--\\"The Dark Knight Returns\\", and the vastly underrated \\"The Dark Knight Strikes Again.\\"
0307276902|5.0|Even with all the hype over the untruths in the book -- it was truly, truly an amazing book.  If you are interested in reading the book but question if you should based on recent press, I have two words for you -- read it!  James Frey does a beautiful job telling his story.  It was worth every moment I spent with it.  I look forward to James Frey's future works and appreciate how he has dealt with the press and how human and real he is.  His humanness and realness are what make his story so incredibly compelling.
B000062YAZ|1.0|My god...what the f*ck were these guys thinking? Have they ever heard of a chord...evidently not as it sounds like theyre just hitting random notes. As for the singing, Araya sounds like he's been sucking too much c*ck...you ever heard of a f*cking strepsil Tom??? Now I must admit when I occasionally become angry i may start to hit things repetitively as hard as I can, but I'm pretty sure that ain't talent. However, Dave Lombardo on the other hand...it seems this is what his whole f*cking career has been based around. Yeah nice one...you can do about 323235450 kick drum beats in one second, GET OVER IT! Looks like he's just chocked on a green olive the way he slams away at the pedals like some kind of demented freak. Kerry King, well...don't get me started on that FAT F*CK. Wonderful how his brain cells appear to be stored inside his biceps...ever heard of a melody kerry? This CD is pure cack, the minute I listened to it I immideately removed it from my CD player which I then rapidly sprayed with disinfectant. This CD isn't worthy of wiping my hairy a*se with. Ah well, atleast I can say I got some enjoyment out of it, when I stamped the f*ck out of it and left it in tatters on the floor the rot.
078681859X|4.0|<br />\\"The Amulet of Samarkand\\" is well written, and the style (as well as much of the content) is very mature, so I wouldn't recommend this to many of the younger, or less advanced, readers of fantasy. <br /> <br />I'm torn with what rating to give this book, because the flight to the climax and the climax of the book are completely different to me. <br /> <br />The flight:  The trade off chapters between Bartimaeus and Nathanial are a superb idea, because after about ten pages of each narration, I found myself growing a bit tired with the current protagonist.  This is a good and bad thing-- good, as in I was grateful for the trade-offs, and bad as in I was left wondering why the writing wasn't a tad more interesting.  Stroud's narration and descriptions are very mature and adult, but it seemed as if sometimes the descriptions that he tried to execute perfectly did nothing to clarify the imagery of the scene but, rather, blurred it a bit by going into overkill.  What I did like was that the chapters often leave you at quite a cliff hanger:  For example, the reader is sure that Nathanial is sure to be defeated, and right when he is about to either die or save himself, the next chapter switches back to the Bartimaeus storyline. <br /> <br />The climax:  This climax is well executed, emotional, and nerve-wracking--everything a climax should be.  Simon Lovelace is a great villain, subtle and professional as he is.  There is little I can say about the climax of this book except that the build-up is intense, the climax itself is... well, climatic, and the falling-action is suitable for the book, which is the first of a trilogy, but could of as well been a standalone. <br /> <br />All in all... <br /> <br />7/10
0312995423|4.0|Digital Fortress is a book set in the NSA headquarters and Spain, a dual-location theme that seems to be a signature for Dan Brown. He often likes to have two or more stories going at once, which are related, but don't converge until later. This book follows the same logic. The storytelling is typical Dan Brown, involving smarter than average characters with little depth who are on a quest of some sort.<br /><br />I felt the storytelling in this book was very TV-like, but I am not complaining. The story is packed with action from beginning to end, and it's difficult to find a good lull to put the book down. The pace is very fast, and you feel compelled to keep reading just to find out what happens next.<br /><br />The twists in the plot are somewhat predictable, but not so much that you'll be bored with it. He leads you in certain directions and fools you a few times, but nothing that will knock you off your foundation. I did not care for the ending, and because of the predictability of the last few chapters, I gave it a 4. The story leading up to the events are much more entertaining, and Dan paints a good picture.<br /><br />I also give it a 4 because I think the character development could be better. He spends more time describing the NSA complex than building characters. This is what makes it so TV like in my opinion. That's his style, and I respect it, but I would have liked to have gotten to know the players better.<br /><br />As far as the technical accuracy, as a software developer by trade I have grown to accept that books related to technology are not accurate. This book does not veer off heavily from the truth, and I enjoyed that. I feel there is an acceptable amount of hollywood effects that diminish the technical accuracy, and the average reader will never notice. It's not so far fetched to make the storyline impossible.<br /><br />Overall, if you want a good technical thriller, this one is well worth the entry price, and I would reccomend it highly.d it highly.
B00005JP4U|5.0|This subject is too important to base your opinions on whether you like Al Gore. I found the picture fascinating. See it and decide for yourself if it fits for you.
B00000J7JO|3.0|This album is a decent rock album, but it's NOT the peppers, infact, to a genuine peppers fan, this sounds like a sell out. For something REAL (and utterly unforgettable) check Blood Sugar...
B000002AS3|5.0|I was born in 1982 and Oasis is, in my opinion, the best band of my generation. Nirvana was inventive and genre-defining, and Green Day is cool if you're into 16 year old girl in high school punk pop, but Oasis is actually a Rock and Roll band.<br /><br />I don't dig the Creed, Nickelback, Staind nonsense. I don't like rap. I don't watch American Idol. I hate country. What can a poor boy do? Find some real rock and roll.<br /><br />So if you're giving this album a negative review, you've either found a stash of outstanding albums that have come out in the past 12 years that I sure haven't heard, or you're still spinning the same stuff you were 20 years ago.<br /><br />There's a reason the people of the UK adore this album; it's amazing. The guitar work is fabulous, Liam's singing is raunchy and rock and roll. The drum work is average at best, but so was Ringo's, since everyone is hung up on the Beatle comparisons.<br /><br />Yes, this album was ranked over Sgt. Peppers and Revolver in the NME poll, which is a very bold statement, considering the importance of those albums. Oh well, thats just the opinion of a couple million people.<br /><br />I'm just glad there's people out there still listening to The Monkees. And I'm glad there's people out there bashing this album. I guess that's the reason I like Oasis and this album so much.
B00005JNTX|5.0|3 unique stories that all somehow conect with great acting and action.  whats not to love?  ok, so this movie is REALLY violent.  so what?  its not like its the only one out there that is violent.  Jessica alba became a mega star playing a sexy stripper.  calm down guys, she keeps her clothes on the whole time.  my personal fav story is the prosistutes vs the police.  pick this dvd up today!
B000FILW86|5.0|Cheap Trick has rocked us for 30+ years and loyal fans have already awarded the band their own hall of fame award! It would be very deserving of the \\"powers that be\\" to do the same. Buy the CD, see a concert and rock on!
B000BYRCH4|3.0|In this thriller about drugs and other stuff, the things you see are more important than the story, acting, ect.  jessica alba and paul walker run around half naked the whole time and look good.  the beach is beautiful as well.  everything else is under-done.  it has its moments but this movie wont go into the history books as a ground breaking film.
B000002MX7|5.0|For me, Chaka shares the tile of Queen of Soul with Aretha.  What an incredible talent!  You can't go wrong with any song from Chaka - she has the ability to take a mediocre song and make it work.  When people have asked me what my favorite song is - well, it's right here: What Cha' Gonna Do For Me is the one.  Ain't Nobody is another treasure from Chaka.  This is a very solid collection from one of the best female vocalists.  Bar none.  There is ONE song that would make this CD perfect and how I wish it was included - Sweet Thing with Rufus is another classic.  Love Chaka.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|There's a bit more sex and violence in this second in the series about the vampire/werewolf war than the first film. It is a little more unfocused as well as it covers the story of the origin of that centuries long war and eschews story and charecter for action. Still, Kate Beckensale never fails to please, whether she is blasting the Hell out of nocturnal, horrible creatures or having R rated sex wiwth her human/lycan/vampire hybrid lover Michael.
B000003CMB|5.0|Yea, only 7 songs but the songs are performed at such a high level. This album is almost perfect in excecution and like the Band's Rock of Ages, it almost seems to be done in a studio, the Brother are so tight!  Absolute delight.  In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed is almost 13 minutes long and you never tire of the song - a real tribute to Dicky Betts great style and licks. Hot 'Lanta is also very solid and intriguing, and Stormy Monday and You Don't Love Me are great rides also.  Gregg Allman has a very soulful voice and is solid on the organ.  This was playing every night in someone's college dorm in the early 70's.  If you didn't have this album, you just weren't cool.  Great album.
B000AP04FG|4.0|Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star in what I guess you would consider to be a Action-packed Romantic Comedy, so in other words \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" includes a little bit for everyone, it's somewhat kid friendly and at the same time it entertians guys as well as gals. Though the humor is held somewhat to a minumum the films overall purpose isnt really to make the audience laugh as much as it is to take to audience on an action packed big-budget roller coaster ride, honestly it is the big name actors Jolie and Pitt that really put butts in the seats but a decent budget and some laugh out loud humor now and then contribute all together which proves to be the right formula for a highly grossing memorable flick - especially with the whole Bitt getting with Angelina and having a kid thing ... that doesnt hurt the film to much either ...
B00000634J|5.0|John was the quintessential Beatle - an Ambassador to world peace, great songwriter, singer and lyricist.  Tragically, he died way before his time.  I always wondered what he would have accomplished had he lived longer.  A must have for any music collection.  Instant Karma, as always, remains an inspirational piece with transendant lyrics and Nobody Told Me is a piercing evaluation of modern times.  Probably his best lyrical composition.  Mind Games and Give Peace A Chance are classic Lennon songs - outward, communal and insightful.  No wonder the Beatles were so good.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|While PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is admittedly gorgeous on almost every visual level, a weak script and strange interpretations by both director and actors mar this otherwise enjoyable film. Joe Wright directs this adaptation of the Jane Austin classic that pairs a country girl lacking looks but loaded with prejudice - played by Keira Knightley - with a city gentleman short on personality but full of pride - played by Matthew Macfadyen. While Wright is true to the period as far as look, he is utterly clueless as far as the manners and customs of the people.<br /><br />So many things that happened left me scratching my head. For example, would the Bennet family really have left their laundry hanging on the line at the beginning of a rainstorm while they stood at the window watching? This may say something about the impracticality of the Bennets; but the way it was handled, it says more about the naivete of the director. Also, people walking in and out of other people's houses and bedrooms unannounced; the grandest lady of the county, Lady Catherine, dropping by unescorted in the middle of the night - and sunburned, no less; a gentleman showing up at dawn to propose, and on foot; everyone getting up from a meal so two people could talk instead of sending them into the parlor: people were more formal and considerate than that in the late 1700's and early 1800's. These types of faux pas break down the credibility of the film and make it less than it could have been.<br /><br />My biggest problem was with the two stars. While Keira Knightly was winsome enough as Elizabeth Bennet, her mischievous smile reminded me of a cat or rat. And since she smiles a lot in the film, I had a hard time warming up to her. Most disappointing, though, was Matthew Macfadyen's downright wooden portrayal of Mr. Darcy. I do believe there is a way to play a character lacking personality without becoming a moribund oaf. Neither actor is particularly attractive in this production, and their odd expressions and mannerisms make them even less so. And their lack of chemistry - even though their relationship is supposed to be alienating and strained - is almost painful. Again, there is a way for two people to act like they dislike each other and still show the telltale signs of a growing attraction. When their love for each other is finally revealed, it seems very unlikely. It certainly isn't emotionally explosive the way the revelation of love between Edward and Elinor in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was. The supporting cast members give far more interesting performances than the stars, and, in most cases, outshine them.<br /><br />The most redeeming aspect of this film is visual, especially the cinematography, which is stunning. There is one tracking shot at the party which is very clever, and makes us feel we are part of it. It begins with Mr. Bennet closing the keyboard to the piano on Mary who had been indiscreetly singing away, continues through the various rooms and conversations, and ends with Mr. Bennet and Mary making up, with a final tag of Elizabeth outside by herself. The entire shot lasts 3 minutes - it seems longer - and is masterful. Another noteworthy shot - less clever because of its self-consciousness - is one of Elizabeth on a swing in the barn, and we are spinning with her, watching the different scenes outside the barn change as they go flying past. While the technique is interesting, it is disruptive, because we are no longer lost in the story, but have suddenly become aware of the camera and what it is doing - an unforgivable sin in cinematography. Other shots of the sumptuous interiors and breathtaking landscapes are wonderful.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun and enjoyable film, if you can get past the disconcerting anachronisms. It doesn't rank with Ang Lee and Emma Thompson's SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, which had a far better script, far better acting and very few if any anachronisms. But it is good for what it is: a visual feast.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith/>Waitsel Smith
B00008973A|5.0|A Chorus Line is one of the most under-rated and barely appreciated film adapation from a broadway musical ever! I watched this movie since I was a little kid and I still adore it. It's got incredible dancing, impeccable acting from Michael Douglas (he is so heartless in this one, and I love it!) and you got flawless direction from Richard Attenbourgh. A Chorus Line is a breath of fresh air and it deserves to be treated with the respect that other musicals get. I highly recommend checking this film out. Enjoy!
0451196716|5.0|This is second Stephen King novel I've read and it confirms my original conviction that he is an excellent writer. Set in near-future America the book follows a sixteen year old who signs up for the biggest sporting event of the time: the Long Walk. A walking competition where the last man standing wins and if you slow down for too long you buy yourself a 'ticket' out of not only the walk but also out of exsistence. As the teenage boys begin their greuling trek across the state of Maine frienships are formed, stories are exchanged and mind and body are put to the ultimate test. <br /> <br />The idea for the plot I thought was brilliant and only Stephen King could tell the tale. Except I don't really know King enough (having only read one of his other books) to feel qualified to say that. However if all King's novels are all like these first two I've read than the man is an absolute genius. Only this story idea could come from a genius. <br /> <br />I love the way he keeps the plot moving and still has time to paint a sharp mental picture for the reader. His characters act with incredible realism and he shows the walkers slow descent into  hysteria with a kind of terrible beauty. He also gives the gore in his stories a gut wrenching quality and whether you want to or not you are forced to see the repulsive majesty of the scene he is describing. Chills run up my spine when I think what one of his more ghoulish tales (the other King book I've read being the Green Mile) with a lot more blood must be like. 'The Long Walk' has its moment but for those weak of heart and stomach (like myself)  rejoice, this book is not scary or incredibly gruesome. It may leave you feeling slightly disturbed but not horror struck. <br /> <br />I had only one problem with the book: the ending. The conclusion was kind of clipped. It felt like King had forgotten to finish the book until the morning before it was due be to published and in  a mad scramble he had to rush the last bit. The rest of the book was so thorough and detailed but the last part was too adbrupt for my liking. I think this may have been a deliberate attempt by the author to make the writing change as the main character slowly lost his mind, however I still don't like it. <br /> <br />Besides that not much is wrong with the book. It is a constant page turner and is not a very complicated read making this a thouroughly enjoyable novel. It has finished the work the Green Mile began and turned me into a loyal fan of King.
0316168815|3.0|without giving to much away....this was definetly a different read for me,Not as sad as I thought it would be...I would reccomend it for fans of this authors work or for a summer read or for traveling. Over all not a bad read I would try this author again.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|So here's how it goes for me & music: Once in a while I hear something on the radio, or a snippet of something, & I just know right away I gotta have that. It doesn't happen often, but it's awesome when it does.<br /><br />  So I'm driving out of El Paso on I-10 & I get just enough of \\"Knights Of Cydonia\\" & bang, just like that I own three Muse CDs. \\"Black Holes and Revelations,\\" the album that \\"Knights ...\\" is on isn't even out yet. May it be a breakthrough for Muse in the U.S., and may they share the success of Coldplay, with whom they have some things in common (without being derivative).<br /><br />  Being British myself, I get over there a couple of times a year (sometimes more) and can attest that there's much fine music that sadly doesn't make it over here. Somehow, I missed Muse. Of the three CDs I bought in my manic embracing of their awesome sound, \\"Absolution\\" is way the strongest.<br /><br />  \\"Absolution\\" is one of those all-too-rare albums I fell in love with first play. It's perfect. Just great. The title song's good, but my personal favorite by far is the (long) \\"Butterflies & Dreams.\\" Having said, not a bad song on the disc.<br /><br />  I drove 1,200 miles through three states listening for much of<br /><br />the drive to Muse, they're in my CD player right now, and I know they'll be there a lot.<br /><br />  If you like Radiohead, Coldplay, Cold, Collective Soul &/or Remy Zero, buy this CD. Remy Zero, whom I also love, has never quite broken out: Muse deserves to every bit as much. It's just stop-the-car-&-buy good.
0563486430|3.0|After learning that we the audience are losing Chistopher Eccleston as Doctor Who, this reviewer decided to go in search of novels featuring the character and actor.  They aren't available locally, so this newer one had to do.  In spite of misgivings regarding media fiction, the story started out well enough, and the writing wasn't half bad.  Half being the key word here.  The first half of the short book is interesting, moves along well, and the characters are well drawn.    Taking place in ancient Rome, the first mystery involves people disappearing, a sculptor and the magical way he has with stone.  However, by the time this mystery is solved, and the second one becomes the center of attention, this reviewer found it was an entirely different story, one that was not so well drawn.  It involves time travel and the paradoxes involved.  Few people understand much about these paradoxes, since they circle back on themselves, which makes them unsolvable.  Neither does this author understand the paradoxes.  And as the story deteriorates, so does the writing.  Still and all, it was a pleasant enough read that draws a reader in to finish it out of politeness.    The TV series has better stories and writing, but for those who can't get enough, these little books will suffice.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|the best part of the film is when the charachter from \\"Scream\\" is in his costume getting high.    for more stuff from the Wayans Brothers, check out \\"In Living Color\\"
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I heard \\"Put Your Records On\\" and felt so carefree but the CD surely doesnt stop there. Its so rare that you can play a CD from start to finish. I love this all the way thru!!! \\"Enchantment\\" and \\"Till it Happens To You\\" are my favorites. I keep hearing comparisons to Billie Holiday, I would put Corinne's voice and style of music in a category all by itself. She has the purest voice I have ever heard. The soul in the music is incredible! I got the Cd like an hour after it came out and have played it every day since several times a day. I even wake up singing it:) If you arent stuck in a box and can appreciate various kinds of music, you will LOVE Corinne Bailey Rae!!
B00070Q7VO|4.0|I purchased this CD last week because I had gotten familiar with \\"Home\\" which by the way is a beautiful song. I would strongly recommend this CD to those who favor Frank Sinatra's style.  There are many songs on the CD which are beatifully crafted like the duet with Nelly Furtado \\"Quando, Quando, Quando\\" (one of my favorites). It's a great song to slow dance to, like mostly all of them in fact. <br />     \\"Save the Last Dance\\" is wonderful. It's sort of playful and rhythmic.  \\"Can't Buy me Love\\" has a good beat; it's about how money can't buy him love and he'd give what he has to offer and that should be enough.  Good song. Overall, all the songs are lovely easy listening songs, and not kind that bore you and make you fall asleep on.  The jazzy melodies in the songs and Michael Buble's rich voice are heart-melting.  A great must-have!
B000EULJLU|4.0|It's been a long wait for Tool fans, but most will be pleased with what they hear on 10,000 Days.       Tool's latest, 10,000 Days, is a hard-rock epic that is pulverizing at times, and very spookily dormant at others.  Unlike most albums released this year, it is not a record to put on while you fold laundry, do the dishes, etc - but it is one of the few albums released now that may still sound exciting in five years. Ultimately, if one has time to sit down and REALLY listen, this album will bring its share of treasures.        Those familiar with Tool will find a great deal of surprises.  First single, \\"Vicarious\\" hinted at somewhat tradtional verse-chorus-verse song structures; it also sounded a lot like where Tool left off before - harder rocking first single than \\"Schism\\" (from Lateralus) and as musically intricate as that found on Lateralus. That's where the familarity stops.        The rest of the album is not remotely like \\"Vicarious.\\"   Here on 10,000 Days, Tool has taken the intricate level of previous album Lateralus to the next degree.  Many songs eclipse eight minutes plus. With the exception of \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"The Pot\\", the rest of the album does not feature traditional song structures at all, but instead, bursts and lulls. Every song seems to be building to some grand crescendo or big payoff - usually with powerful results. It all resonates as an 80 minute hard rock epic.  The question, really, is does the 21st century listener have the time and (importantly) the patience to stick with it?     For those that do, the rewards are immense. There's a lot to sink one's teeth into here, such as Maynard's falsetto singing opening \\"The Pot\\", the two-part elegy to his mother \\"Wings for Marie/10,000 Days\\", the droning \\"Rosetta Stoned\\", and the last five pulverizing minutes of \\"Right in Two\\". Those, along with \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"Jambi\\" are the album's highlights.      Still, it must be said that this album borders on excess.  Does one really need a three to four minute intro leading up to a loud cresendo, then a longer decresendo? This happens more than a few times here.  At nearly 80 minutes in length, there is a lot of fat on this album that could easily be cut away - maybe it wouldn't sound so epic then, but like Aenima or Undertow, their two most straight-forward, hard-rocking albums. Clearly, they were trying to stretch their limits here.  You can't deny the boys credit for trying to go \\"big\\" - but sometimes, even with Maynard's reputed tribute to his late mother being the inspiration of the album/album title,  - this album feels like a musical vanity project more than a rock record. Yes, Tool, are great musicians. But on 10,000 Days, you'd wish they'd just cut the Phish-esque noodling and rock out more.        Aenima is in my opinion their most outright rocking album and personal favorite. 10,000 Days is probably Tool's most epic to date - and with epic usually comes excess. For those unaquainted with Tool, this would not be the album to start with, but with Undertow, Aenima, or Lateralus instead.  For those who already know and love Tool, you might as well purchase this as their next evolution. It could be a long time before we hear anything new from them. 10,000 Days is good - but honestly, they've done it better and with less excess before.
B0000C9ZBW|3.0|I got this because I wanted a very thin watch at a reasonable price.  It fits the bill well - attractive, thin, keeps time (of course).  However, the paint on the band came off within a month or two, so now the band is silvery with a black tint instead of black.

I feel sorry for people that dont understand or give this movie bad reviews.<br /><br />I cant stop laughing just thinking about it while writing this review.  Everytime you watch it is funnier then the last, always finding something else to laugh at.
B00005JNS0|5.0|All right. I wanted to see the characterizations by Car Talk stars, Tom and Ray, a.k.a. Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers. The Car Talk comedians make a brief, not-so-funny appearance in the first scenes. Still, I, my 14-year-old son and his aunt came away happy, despite the predictable and corny story line.<br /><br />At the grand opening event, rookie racer Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) vies for the coveted Piston Cup against incumbent champion, The King (Richard Petty), and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), who is determined to best his perennial second-place, at all costs. The rookie, naturally full of himself, expects to step from peddling Rusteze into big league Dynaco sponsorship. But the three tie for first place, and a tie-breaker is scheduled in California. Lightning immediately sets off, aboard his faithful truck, Mack (John Ratzenberger). En route, Mack's back panel accidentally opens and the sleeping Lightning falls out on the dark interstate, where he is awakened by the roar of oncoming traffic.<br /><br />Frantic to find Mack, Lightning chases the wrong truck off the interstate and winds up on Route 66 in Radiator Springs. That's where the fun starts. Race cars have no lights, and Lightning drives blindly, tearing up the road as he goes.<br /><br />In court, mechanic, judge and 1951 Hudson Hornet Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) are inclined (the last, for secret reasons) to let Lightning go, but local attorney Sally (Bonnie Hunt) pressures the judge to make him repair the road he has destroyed. During his days at work, Lightning is befriended by Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and eventually by all the other town characters as well, including Sally, Sheriff (Michael Wallis), tire store owner Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) and his sidekick Guido (Guido Quaroni), a retired army jeep named Sarge (Paul Dooley), a shabby VW bus, Fillmore (George Carlin)--and even the Doc, whose historical racing championships Lightning discovers and advertises.<br /><br />There are plenty of twists and turns in this albeit predictable road, but the end result is an instant classic, filled with great Randy Newman music, terrific scenery and some wonderful lessons about friends, community and the importance of keeping things in perspective.<br /><br />We loved it, cliches and all.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

B000EMGAGW|3.0|Mobb Deep is one of my favorite rap groups.  The Infamous never gets old.  Prodigy and Havoc showed that they were lyrically better than almost anybody else.  I can't say that G-Unit ruined Mobb Deep because some of the beats sound great and the rest of the G-Unit clique(not 50) can contribute.  But Mobb Deep should be able to tool on 50 with their lyrical style, not be over powered. Mobb Deep sounds tired and their lyrics dont cut it. If your looking for another The Infamous then don't look here. I hope that with G-Unit backing them, Mobb Deep can put out another classic.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|Before I had satellite radio, I hadn't heard of AFI... then they seemed to explode to a larger audience when \\"Silver and Cold\\" was released.  Their lyrics are complex and almost require Dennis Miller for translation at times. <br /> <br />Overall, I've never heard a band combine rock, dance, synth, and melody into an entertaining package like AFI can.  Davey's voice is haunting... but I wish they would quite interrupting their songs with all of his screaming (Seether has a bad habit of this too -- \\"Gasoline\\" for example)...  <br /> <br />Miss Murder is catchy, entertaining, song (critics will call it a sell-out; but is AFI's goal to please 30 industry critics or 3,000,000 zealous fans)... then halfway through the song Davey interrupts it with another screaming fit. <br /> <br />The screaming is SOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointing... AFI's riffs and lyrics are so complex that it often requires a few listens to \\"get it\\".  So you're concentrating deeply on a track and then the song goes into \\"System of a Down\\" mode... this should be so embarrassing for an otherwise brilliant band. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong though.. I really like AFI, but they don't rate a five until they quit interrupting their songs with fits of screaming into a microphone.
B0000263JN|4.0|Although this is not my very favorite ISB album, Hermester Barrington has described in his review of this CD, and in a delightfully creative way, the music contained in the entire Incredible String Band catalog.  This may indeed be one of the best in an unbroken string of fabulous works, but I believe that each Incredible String Band lover's sentimental favorite is whichever album they heard first (my first exposure was to WEE TAM & THE BIG HUGE; it remains an all-time favorite, rivaled only by the band's later, very different album, LIQUID ACROBAT AS REGARDS THE AIR).  Reading the other reviews of THE HANGMAN'S BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER, I can only nod my head in agreement with most of what has been said.  This album IS one of the definitive ones, but I should add that it is but one stop on a long, artistically successful journey that includes virtually no aberrations, and which is rich with unexpected twists and turns on and off an unpaved path.  No other group of artists has been more independent of trends, fads or commercial considerations.  Although the group might be lumped in with Steeleye Span, Fairport Convention and Pentangle, if it must be categorized, it is really almost an entire genre unto itself, with the aforementioned groups, as great as they are, much more conventional in both material and musical approach. Even when ISB made later forays into rock, pop and country, they did so, it seems, only to expand their palette of colors, growing and developing according to their own peculiar and beautiful vision.  HARD ROPE & SILKEN TWINE, in my opinion, is at least as good as their self-titled debut recording (I actually like the later one much better; and come to think of it, the first record may be their weakest) and we are talking several years separating the two. I would not necessarily recommend HANGMAN as a place to start for beginners, as it is one of ISB's most musically and lyrically challenging efforts, but I could easily be wrong, as other reviewers fell in love with the band because they first heard this record...l in love with the band because they first heard this record...
B000BT97AO|2.0|I really hate to give a film with such talented people behind it a low rating, but I honestly feel that this is a genuine stinker. It seems targeted for artsy, 'intellectual' teenaged girls - I mean hell, the major conflict of the story is the main character's rebellion against her oppressive tyrant of a mother (in the dream state, that is...in real life, she's dying of cancer or something, and seems genuinely sweet). Seems the main reason for this subconscious feeling of repression by her mother is because they pressure her to perform in the family circus, even though all she seems to want to do is doodle little symbols and stick figures. I also didn't really get the whole significance of the 'bad' twin taking over her life and turning into a slutty punk chick with an attitude - i'm guessing this is another facet of her personality, but it just didn't move me. As for the eye candy, I wasn't all too impressed, either. Something about the dull brown colors and the way everyone looked like their faces or mouths were cut from magazine clippings (probably figments of the girl's imagination), it just wore on me. I actually fell asleep twice during the 'climax', in which the girl is imprisoned by her mother and forced to dress proper and sit at the dinner table. All in all, two stars because this is basically a teen chick flick in disguise, and as such, angsty young girls will probably relate to it.
0312305060|5.0|A stunning book, beautifully written, absolutely marvelous. I'd give it more stars if I could. Cunningham, who has written some stellar books (\\"A Home at the End of the World\\" especially), makes this one his masterpiece.  <br /> <br />Of crucial importance for this book is reading Virginia Woolf's \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" preferably as soon as possible before reading \\"The Hours.\\" Cunningham's brilliance here is his homage to Woolf's great book, entwining modern characters and situations into his book, all of which have root-- no matter how subtle-- in the Woolf book. These surprises-- this connections of time, continuity, emotional desperation, the siren's song of death, the search for meaning in the smallest actions-- all of it is rooted in \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" How Cunningham transposes it to \\"The Hours\\" is sheer bliss, a one-of-a-kind experience like no other book I've ever read. <br /> <br />I don't know what he reader would take without having read \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" first. I intentionally read the Woolf right before reading the Cunningham, knowing that he wrote \\"The Hours\\" as both an homage and a sort of continuity-- not a sequel, or follow-up, but a careful rethinking that leads one great novel into another. I assume the reader would enjoy \\"The Hours\\" without having read a lick of Woolf. But don't-- the pleasures of the second derive from its astonishing intimacy with the first. <br /> <br />Granted, Virginia Woolf is no easy read. \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" arguably her finest novel, is an existential, internal character study filled with revelations and epiphanies so subtle, so transcendent, so small (and yet so internally large), the book can be read several times to grasp its complexity. Yet I can't imagine the pleasure I got out of \\"The Hours\\" without having read Woolf first.  <br /> <br />This is truly Cunningham's finest piece of work to date, and frankly, one of the best modern novels I've read. This is a must for Woolf fans, of course. And Cunningham (obviously influenced byWoolf) firmly establishes himself as of the top authors in the modern literary canon. An absolute gem.
B000002J0B|5.0|I think this is easily the band's most musical album. As far as songwriting is concerned, the songs are all unique and Led Zeppelin shows their ability to cross styles and textures. There is not a song on this disc I don't like, with standout tracks being \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" for its incredible groove and \\"The Ocean\\" because its straight out rocks. Led Zeppelin always rocks hard, of course, but this album is truly something special and showcases the group not just as blues rockers but as true musicians.
B000002KXV|5.0|With regard to the sound quality of this cd, there are many out there who are concerned with such things that consider this one of the best sounding cds of all time.  This album is an early 80's all digital recording that was released on cd in the early days of the format.  In that sense it probably sounds exactly as it should.  More and more information is coming out about the current state of audio mastering, about the \\"loudness war,\\" and the virtual elimination of dynamic range in modern day cd's.  The Nightfly is an example of how cd's are suppose to sound.  If it doesn't seem \\"loud\\" enough, try adjusting the volume on your stereo.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I hate singles CD's. Ya know, the type that have that one or if your lucky, two tracks that deserve instant replay. It's so rare for me to find a CD where my finger isn't itching to get passed the filler moments. Not so with Corinne. I am in love. From start to finish, this album delivers some of the best soul music I've heard in quite some time. Corrine has an unmistakable voice that has been drawing comparisons to other women in the business, but I find her voice strikingly original. The lyrics are very adept too, and I was glad to see Corrine not only wrote a majority of her songs, but co-wrote the others as well. This CD is a perfect summer CD with tunes to groove out to, Put your records on is one track that you can't help but begin to sway to. Also, trouble sleeping is a track that I adore, same with like a star, choux pastry heart, every track has this wicked catchy vibe, with various layers. I love it!
0441013074|4.0|Well written and an interesting read, but I was left feeling a little empty and disappointed at the end.  Not a \\"feel good\\" ending.
0446577383|4.0|THE REASON FOR THE TITLE:  I'm glad I read the book before reading any of the reviews.  I find book reviews of thrillers like this difficult to write.  Much of \\"The Camel Club\\"'s appeal comes from the way it unfolds in ways different from what you might expect.  As I read through many of the reviews already posted, I SAW enough PLOT SPOILERS to take much of the enjoyment out of the book.      With that out of the way, I think it's fair to say without giving anything away:    * The book does have a bit of a comic book feel to it.  Sometimes this bothers me, for example, when it happens in a novel that is part of a series that's been realistic all along.  \\"The Camel Club\\" is a stand-alone novel, so the small stretches it takes didn't bother me at all.  I mention it only because others have commented negatively about it.  * You might think that it would be difficult to feel anything for the Camel Club memebers--four, shall we say eccentric, over 50 types who hang out a community of tents mostly for those with no other place to live pitched across from the White House.  However, I quickly found myself caring what happened to them.  * It is preachy. Those whose politics are to the right might find it difficult see beyond that. I'm not being critical.  I'd feel the same way if it were my ox being gored.  * While it may not be great literature, I don't go looking for great literature among books of this genre.  I found it entertaining with plot devices I hadn't encountered before.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone looking for some escapist entertainment.    ---------    Added in edit:  I am delighted to see that the two reviews who added their reviews after mine did not include plot spoilers, so you can read their reviews without hurting your enjoyment of the book.  I hope subsequent reviewers will follow suit!
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|This album took the skin off my back, and yes like another review said you need to listen to a Strokes album more than once, thats a good sign in my book. The second album did good for me too but this 3rd one is a master piece in my book. Take the test have a feed of whiskey and give it a listen...lovely, and if you don't like a tipple listen anyway!!Booze aside critics suck everything is relative, if you like music and you're willing to take a step into 'maybe the next album will be different' I don't think the Strokes will dissapoint, so Mr C has an alchohol problem? So do I when the liquor stores closed, and don't we all?.....By the way I like all the tracks on this album Caged Heart seems to be my favourite ..today.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|This collection is a happening and it freaks me out.  Yeah baby ! <br /> <br />An alternate universe of primal sixties music, resurrected for all to enjoy.
1400079179|5.0|I've come across a number of reviews suggesting Swords at Sunset be read in tandem with The Da Vinci Code. Now I understand why. I had the pleasure of reading this remarkable book recently and was captivated by author Michael Bradley's well framed argument that the Knights Templar brought Holy Grail refugess, descendents of Jesus, to North America long before Columbus ever set foot here. Then I learned that Bradley was a researcher behind the Da Vinci Code movie. The Da Vinci Code book and movie are both highly enjoyable. But what's really fascinating is Bradley's non-fiction book putting the Grail in Canada and the United States centuries ago. I learned a great deal. This book is highly recommended.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|A terrific CD! It's refreshing to hear a band actually TRYING to write interesting songs both musically and lyrically instead of just going through the motions or resting on their laurels. I had heard of this band but wasn't familiar with their music. I accidently stumbled upon the CD when I borrowed my daughter's car one day and it was in the player. Do yourself a favor and spend the money on this one. You won't want to take it out of your CD player 'cause it gets better with each spin. Can't wait to see how they follow it up ...

B0008JIJ2E|3.0|Looking for a family movie to add to the DVD collection, I recalled The Karate Kid. The young boy, the mentor, wax-on/wax-off and some Karate for excitement. Turns out our memory of this movie is 30 minutes of Pat Morita scenes. <br /> <br />Everything the above reviewer \\"Dubyac99 MC White\\"  said is correct. <br />Dated and disappointing. Also, the video is grainy and the sound is just okay.
B000F4RHB6|3.0|i liked Huey Lewis&the News a bit more back in the 80's. they understood bar band Polish&ran with it. Huey Lewis had a rasphy voice that worked  on this Band's Hits. Problem is they faded pretty quickly as the 80' s started to end musically&the 90's stuff on up is big time corn. that cover of Smoeky RObinson's \\"Crusin\\" is a Bad joke. but during there hey day in the early 80's Huey Lewis&the News had some good Pop Songs that still have a moment every now&then.still kinda amazed they got over with \\"I want a New Drug\\" consdering that time period of the 80's was the just say No era.
B000BSLU2S|3.0|I replaced the original compound on my Toshiba Satellite and it made no difference. This was two weeks ago. My average time on the laptop is about 8 hours per day, so according to the specs, I'd have to wait almost a month for Arctic Silver 5 to 'set'. Before applying the new compound, my temperature readings were stabilizing at 51-53C (normal usage), after the new compound, my temperature fluctuates from 51-57C and then settling at 51-52C so that didn't change a bit.<br /><br />According to the instructions on their website: for an 'Intel Core 2 Duo'; first, 'tint' a thin film across and apply a 1mm line/strip vertically on the cpu and set the heatsink to let it spread -- that's exactly what I did and without overspreading it. I'm not seeing a difference and 200 hours of waiting time is certainly not acceptable.
0312330529|5.0|Gregory David Roberts borrows heavily from another Roberts, ie., Paul William Roberts. If you have read his(Paul William's) non-fictional account of India in his stupendous travelogue \\"Empire of the Soul\\", you would find many uncanny resemblences. That trip to Afghanistan and the descriptions of sorrounding areas, St. Xavier's miraculous preservation and even the general description of Bombay. Not to take anything away from Gregory David's fine novel, but the other Roberts(Paul William's) is outstanding in his description of India. He combines history, philosophy and travel into a gripping personal account that is far more scholarly without being pretentious. Try to get hold of that other book and see for yourselves the fresh insight that you would automatically get from \\"Shantaram\\".
B0000025ZF|4.0|Make no mistake, this is a strange album, and it may take you a few listens to fully appreciate it. But it is GOOD, and worth having for any avid fan of Pink Floyd. Though...more casual fans of the band looking for another \\"Wall\\" might want to pass this by, it really is different. <br /> <br /> <br />The concept of the album is based on a dream....and a chaotic one at that, filled with moments happiness, fear, isolation, anger, confusion, and...sex. So being based on a dream you'd expect the album to follow a rather strange jump through emotions and be slightly confusing as dreams often are.....and that is EXACTLY what it does. When I listen to this I feel like I am listening to someone else's nightmare...but in a good way. That, I believe, was Roger's intent, and he delivers. <br /> <br />There are only two truly weak songs on this album, the most awful of which being 4:37AM: Arabs With Knives and West German Skies. Moment of Clarity is also rather weak. <br /> <br />Everything else has its good, memorable moments. Yes it is true that the album does feel like a run-on song, with similar guitar riffs in each track, but each one holds enough lyrical uniqueness to be remembered on its individual merits. <br /> <br />My personal favourite on the album is \\"Running Shoes\\", with Roger singing powerful shouted lyrics, an echo effect and background chorus used to full effect and the whole nightmarish element of the song working quite well. One of Roger's best solo songs, I believe. <br /> <br />\\"Apparently they were Traveling Abroad\\" has some delightfully dark moments in it where roger lowers his voice and the chords dip to forceful effect.  <br /> <br />Sexual Revolution is one of the album's highlights, don't let the title scare you, it's really a great song.  <br /> <br />Go Fishing is half good, half bad, with some weak moments, but occasionally a beautifully sung lyric will grab you. <br /> <br />Dunroamin, Duncarin, Dunlivin is kind of strange, but humourous when youlisten to the background voices of the trucker, and roger's muffled yelling in the background after his girl falls for someone else in this dream. <br /> <br />Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking...the title track, is the third highlight of the album. It's funny to listen to, catchy, and the background vocals will make you laugh. Lyrically weird, memorable all around. <br /> <br />Every Stranger's Eyes is absolutely beautiful....it's the anthem of the album, lyrically deep, emotionally deep, this song will uplift you and you can't help but sing along to the words. While most of the songs on the album have been chaotic and random, this one feels like a true song with a structure to it, which is probably why Roger has performed it so much on tour. A great song. To me the album ends here. And oh god what a wonderful ending it is, so fantastically powerful! <br /> <br />Moment of Clarity that follows really isn't that great of a song and is more of a bookend track than anything else. <br /> <br /> <br />If you are a fan of Pink Floyd and Roger Waters you should buy this album. If you like weird, dark, humour...then buy this album. If you are looking for Animals Part 2, though, this isn't it. <br /> <br />
B00026WU7I|5.0|Where has this album been my whole life? I heard \\"Buckets of Rain\\" on NPR and loved it. I got the rest of the album and it blew me away. I'm a casual Dylan fan and this is a perfect album to listen to on a rainy day or just when you want to relax and enjoy some good, honest music and lyrics.
B0000027I6|4.0|Considering the fantastic reviews this album has already received, I needn't have to go far to convince you that this is really a good album. <br /> <br />But more than just being good, this is the Waters solo album that sounds, by far, the most like Pink Floyd. With fantastic guitar work, a return to Waters' characteristic biting political and war themes, and some tracks that are dark and really make you think. Accompanied by music that drives the point home. <br /> <br />I have a hard time deciding whether this album or Radio K.A.O.S. are Water's best, but both are absolutely worth having for their unique elements. If you want that \\"lost\\" Pink Floyd album...though, this is, WITHOUT A DOUBT, that \\"lost album.\\" <br /> <br />Water's genius makes itself apparent here, starting from the very first track. A long instrumental piece with gorgeous...absolutely gorgeous...David Gilmour-esque guitar work. While in the background a war veteran speaks of the time he had to leave a fellow soldier, Bill Hubbard...to die in \\"no man's land\\". Powerful, gripping, almost tearful. <br /> <br />The second song, What God Wants, Pt. 1, feels like something that came straight off of The Wall, as much of this album does feel. You have the same effect of the voices in the background chanting the chorus as we heard on Run Like Hell or Waiting for the Worms... <br /> <br />Now, if you are quite religious... What God Wants is sure to offend you. But if you can get past the lyrics and see the song as a powerful musical piece, as it is, then you will enjoy it.  <br /> <br />Perfect Sense, Pt. 1 will take a bit to get into, but it will eventually grow on you, however it is Part 2 that is the real highlight, with powerful arena-style vocals and powerful backing. Still, not quite as powerful as \\"Every Stranger's Eyes\\" from Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking, but great nonetheless. <br /> <br />The Bravery of Being out of Range is absolutely fantastic. One of the three highlights of the album, this song grabs you from the start, and the chorus line \\"hey old man what the hell you gonna kill next?\\" is typical of Waters, refreshingly bitter. Drumming, guitar, vocals, all work well here to make a great song. <br /> <br />And with that we now arrive at the weaker part of the album. Late Home Tonight parts 1 and 2 are, forgive me, entirely disposable tracks. Too Much Rope is a little better, but not by far...it just doesn't work as a song.  <br /> <br />Thankfully this weak portion doesn't last long and with Track 9, What God Wants, Part 2, we are thrust back into what is, without a doubt, the most mind-blowingly f-ing AMAZING song on the entire album. It's entirely too short, its so good you want it to last for several minutes! <br /> <br />What God Wants, Part 2, picks up where Part 1 left off, and then elevates the song into fantastic shouted Waters vocals, even more fantastic lyrics, strong guitar work, excellent bass, I'm not kidding you folks this song will give you shivers up your spine, and give you tingles from how powerful it is. This is THE song on the album to play in your car at full volume for the rest of the world to hear. This song alone makes the album worth purchasing. I cannot express it enough, one of Waters' best tracks since going solo! <br /> <br />Part 3 of that song, however, is disposable...doesnt sound like Parts 1 or 2 at all, completely skip-able. <br /> <br />Watching TV will grow on you, its about the killing at Tiannamen Square in China...its disturbing, so be prepared for that. <br /> <br />Three Wishes is spooky, the lyrics of the Genie are sung with warped effect, a delightfully dark song.  <br /> <br />It's A Miracle takes the darkness even further, a song about Capitalism.  <br /> <br />Amused to Death reminds me of the Floyd album Final Cut...it has its great moments, its weak moments, but overall a nice closer for the album. <br /> <br /> <br />I would have given this 5 stars if not for that set of three impossibly weak tracks in themiddle. But both sides of the album are powerful, and money spent on buying this would not be wasted. <br /> <br />Once again, this IS the lost Pink Floyd album. It IS The Wall reminisced. It IS Pink Floyd's lost element. You'll be happy with this purchase.

Instead of a hard-edged prison population, we get caricatures and stereotypes. Adam Sandler is more convincing as Happy Gilmore than Paul \\"The Wrecking\\" Crewe. Though a brilliant stand-up comedian, Chris Rock has yet to find his cinematic niche. The only bright spots are Reynolds (in the Michael Conrad role) and Courteney Cox.

B0007VCZ50|5.0|Branford Marsalis says in the film about Sting's music:  \\"The music is a tremendous social statement.  Musicians are always social critics.  And that's the biggest problem with pop music is that they don't have any more social critics.  They don't have enough people with the intelligence or the balls to stand up and see the world for what it is and say, 'This s$!t is out.' \\"<br /><br />When viewing the same problems, what makes one person call for violence and another person call for understanding?  There are probably many reasons.  The title to this review is an Anais Nin quote that I think suggests part of the answer.<br /><br />'Bring on the Night' is a movie about the launching of 'The Dream of the Blue Turtles' album and the creation of an interracial band.  The songs on the album are protest songs, protesting cold war propoganda, nuclear waste, possessive love, pride that refuses to forgive, and many other things.  For example, \\"If You Love Somebody Set Them Free\\" is a response to his earlier \\"Every Breath You Take\\".<br /><br />Sting's intent was to be disarming, to disarm through the discussion and publication of ideas.  He took a stand by stating his positions.  He did not choose to be silent or abandon the issues he cared about.  In his mind, love is not hidden and not silent.  Love doesn't say, \\"I care about this issue, but don't tell anyone what I think.\\"  Good protest songs are made to be sung.<br /><br />Some of the lyrcis from the movie include:  \\"One world is enough for all of us.\\"  \\"Love is the seventh wave.\\"  \\"I spent too many years at war with myself.  Doctor has told me, it's no good for my health.\\"<br /><br />Sting spends time writing a song to his ex, where he laid out both his admission of guilt and an olive branch for reconciliation:  \\"If I built this fortress around your heart, encircled you in trenches and barbed wire, then let me build a bridge, for I cannot fill the chasm, and let me set the battlements on fire.\\"<br /><br />This movie is the most fluid rock band film I've seen, and both the music and interviews discuss substantive issues.

B0000025JT|5.0|This review is for the Barbra Streisand album Guilty, released in 1980. I have this title on LP and CD and it is a real joy to listen to. I like most of the songs on this album. The ones that I like are the two songs Barbra did with Barry: the title track and \\"What Kind of Fool\\". Both are quite memorable. Barbra and Barry sounded great together singing these two songs. Some of the other songs that I like are \\"Life Story\\", \\"Promises\\" (even though I haven't heard it in a while), \\"Run Wild\\", and several others. When this album came out in 1980, it sold quite a lot of copies (I learned that it reached quintuple platinum; that is quite amazing). Twenty-five years later (last year in 2005) these two singers got back together to record and release the sequel to this title, \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" (which I have not yet heard, but am thinking about giving it a listen). I should point out that Barbra and Barry sang \\"Guilty\\" and \\"What Kind of Fool\\" six years later in 1986, when she did her \\"One Voice\\" concert show at her home. They were great on that, but I don't want to get off the subject about this 1980 title. As always, Barbra's voice is so sweet and soothing to the soul; no Barbra Streisand music library should be without this title. Get it while you can!!!
0312983867|3.0|Most people learn from their mistakes. Not so Stephanie Plum. In this, the eighth novel of the popular series by Janet Evanovich, Stephanie volunteers to help find a missing mother and daughter who are on the run from malicious mob-boss Eddie Abruzzi. In the (by now-formulaic) course of her investigation, Stephanie finds several corpses, is threatened with death, has her car torched and apartment broken into, and ends up getting kidnapped and almost killed before the case is solved. <br />Okay, I get the Jersey attitude and the fact that Abruzzi is a nut-case. But it seems that Stephanie could've saved herself a whole lot of grief with a few simple conversations instead of her misplaced bravado. And what's with Morelli and Ranger? They're supposed to be street-smart, but you wouldn't know it with their bumbling.

B00005V1Y0|5.0|When I'm fairly certain that the world just may not be unfolding as it should, the temperature is near 100, and the U. S. casualties from the War In Iraq now have reached over 2,500-- the newscasters rarely give figures of anyone else--STRICTLY BALLROOM is one of a handful of films that always makes me smile. Set in Australia and directed by Baz Luhrmann, it's all about winning the Pan Pacific Grand Prix ballroom dancing competition. Besides the extraordinary dancing by the two principal actors Paul Mercurio and Tara Morice, the story is one that most of us want to believe: that in the end-- after all that's what happens in romantic comedies-- boy gets girl, ugly duckling becomes suave swan, the older generation get a chance to try things again, or at least see their broken dreams achieved by their children, and good triumphs over the cynical, bad guys.<br /><br />In addition to the fine performances by Mercurio and Morice, the other actors are quite wonderful, particularly the Hasting parents. Golden hair color not found in nature and toupees abound, as does delicious humor.<br /><br />Leave it to the Aussies to do everything right in a movie.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|The war between the vampire covens and their former servants the Lycans (werewolves) continues! Underworld: Evolution immediately follows the events of the first film. After dicing head bloodsucker Viktor's head in uneven halves, the sexy and undead Death Dealer Selene is on the run from her fellow vampires, her only ally the werewolf-vampire hybrid Michael Corvin. With the most sadistic vampire of all, Marcus Corvinus, having just awakened from his long dormant state, the hunt for the two fugitives figures to be all the more savage and unyielding. Marcus also has the added agenda of desiring to liberate his centuries-long captive twin brother, William, who is revealed to be the first ever werewolf and the most depraved. Selene and Michael settle even more firmly in between Marcus's crosshairs when they attempt to prevent William's release. But, with the help of the oldest immortal alive, the beautiful ex-Death Dealer and the human-turned-beastie just might have the slimmest of chances to succeed.<br /><br />Selene's persona this time isn't as mechanical, giving Kate Beckinsale more opportunities to emote. Fueled perhaps by her kind's betrayal and a bit by her blossoming relationship with Michael, Selene seems more invested emotionally with the goings-on around her. Kate has never looked better or deadlier in her black leathers, thanks in large part to director Len Wiseman, who also doubles as her husband. And yes, for all the red-blooded guys and multitudes of perverts out there, Kate is shown in one tasteful love scene about 37 minutes into the movie. But it's one of those scenes where you think you see more of Kate's tangibles than was really shown. I still don't think much of Speedman's earnest acting style, considering it merely substantial fluff. I gotta admit, though, that his werewolf guise can kick beaucoup butt. Meanwhile, British supporting actors Bill Nighy, Tony Curran and Steven Mackintosh lend substance to the proceedings. Call me shallow but an English accent always seems to give instant verisimilitude to a cinematic effort. The signing of upper echelon British thespian Derek Jacobi is a coup of sorts for the horror genre. As the father of Marcus and William, his character, Alexander Corvinus, is suitably grave, commanding and manipulating. Is it a coincidence that, with the influx of British actors, the plotline suddenly takes a decidedly Shakespearean turn?<br /><br />Where the first Underworld had dead spots and stale action sequences, Underworld: Evolution is as gothically gorgeous to look at, but is leaner, more absorbing and just plain better. The sequel delves more deeply into the Underworld history and mythology and defines Selene's place in it. For action and f/x fans, the truck chase scene is a must-see, as are most of the battle sequences, to be honest. A familiarity with the first movie is recommended as the dense backstory and the several flashbacks to the original film might bewilder those fresh to the franchise.

B000059Z8J|5.0|In my anxiety to see Superman Returns, I've been passing time by watching again every Superman movie and television series (live action and animated) that I can get my hands on. I went through the George Reeves series, the Lois & Clark and Superboy/Smallsville series and the cartoon Superman, Justice League and, God help me, even the 70's Superfriends shows. But I've saved for last the piece-de-resistance: the Christopher Reeve classics.<br /><br />I've genuinely forgotten how great and sweet the 1978 Superman film was, and is. A feeling of enchantment is launched in the air as \\"June 1938\\" flashes on the screen, then a boy leafs thru the pages of Action comics, the young lad's voiceover commenting on the Depression and the importance of truth-dealing newspapers such as the Daily Planet in so turbulent and troubled an era. Then, the immortal John Williams-crafted Superman theme song is heard and the adventure begins. True, I've always had to grind my teeth and wait out the sterile 25 minute opening. But once the film focuses on Planet Earth and the arrival of baby Kal-El, it's all so good. The segment of Clark's child- and teenhood is depicted in an almost pastoral manner, giving heft to scenes of Clark learning how truly special he is, and how he is ultimately alone. These bittersweet moments of lessons learned will shape the man that Clark will become. Then, the tragedy of his adopted father's death, leading eventually to Clark's discovery of the Fortress of Solitude and thus, his Kryptonian heritage. There is almost a sense of intermission at this point, wherein the viewer can take a breath, relax and prepare for the second half of the film. I think I'll start a new paragraph.<br /><br />Twelve years pass. Clark, now in his Superman guise, flies away from the Fortress of Solitude. The camera cuts next to a cabbie telling his passenger that he's arrived at the Daily Planet, and Clark Kent's new chapter begins. There, he meets Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and Editor-in-Chief Perry White. Clark doesn't waste time setting up his bespectacled persona  of cluelessness and clumsiness in several nicely-paced sequences that had moments of sheer hilarity and screwballness. Next, Superman's nemesis shows up, the fiendishly clever and criminal Lex Luthor and things begin to get somewhat serious, though Luthor's wacky sidekicks intermittently interject an element of humor. Luthor's plan is diabolical and ably challenges Superman's abilities. But, in the end, all is well as the Man of Steel foils Luthor's scheme and sends him packing to the hoosegow; Superman has a fleeting romantic moment with Lois. End of film.<br /><br />Christopher Reeve. Christopher Reeve. Christopher Reeve. Despite the all-star cast, Christopher Reeve makes the movie. He inhabits Superman as if he were his favorite pajamas, instilling in his iconic superhero that perfect blend of confidence, steely resolve and gentlemanly decorum. On the other hand, he infuses his Clark Kent with the proper amount of  \\"aw, shucks\\" country bumpkin and slouching mild mannerisms. A perfect portrayal. Christopher Reeve was born to be Superman. The reaction of the crowd upon Supe's first public appearance is still thrilling to witness. Lois Lane's freaked-out \\"You've got me?! But, who's got you?\\" is still a classic line. Margot Kidder is delicious as reporter Lois Lane:  nosy, plucky and in-your-face. She melts perfectly for Superman and routinely snubs Clark Kent. Go check out the screen test in the special features to see how much better Margot is, compared to the other actresses that went for the role. Gene Hackman plays Luthor more comically than I would've expected but, what the hell, it works. The best I can say of Marlon Brando as Jor-El is that his distinctive voice is used in the trailer of Superman Returns.<br /><br />The special effects, for their time, are wonderfully innovative and wow-inducing. The only effect that doesn't look convincing is the sequence where teenage Clark outruns a train. Everything else, perfection.<br /><br />The special features are pretty sweet: Side A contains an insightful commentary by director Richard Donner; 10 added scenes including a young Lois with her parents on a train and a scene with Jor-El and Superman; some \\"Superman - The Legacy\\" fun facts; and a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Side B contains: three documentaries (\\"Taking Flight: the Development of Superman\\", \\"Making Superman: Filming the Legend\\" and \\"The Magic Behind the Cape\\"); deleted scenes; screen tests of Superman (Reeve with sweaty pits!), Lois Lane (with actresses Anne Archer, Lesley Ann Warren, Margot Kidder and Stockard Channing) and Ursa, the Kryptonian supervillainess in the sequel; a teaser trailer; and a TV spot.<br /><br />This is a classic film, full of matinee fun and movie magic. It certainly has stood the test of time. Despite the fact that I can't wait to see Superman Returns, I doubt it could live up to Superman 1 or 2.

B000F1IQN2|3.0|This was not a boxoffice smash as people just don't wish to be reminded of such calamity as happened at the 20th Olymiad in Germany in 1972.  Howard Cosell was there for ABC Sports and wrote a book about his involvement and the truth of the matter.  It all seemed like a bad dream.  There was terrible despair as it was kept out of the press as much as possible.  It was an echo of things past which sometime could be a precursor of things to come.      Sometimes instinct compels you to say certain things to a certain limit.  Is it Joe Allen or Carl Hampton to blame for those awful, awful selections.  Who has the temerity to take responsibility for such a continuing campaign.  I simply can't give either the benefit of a doubt as both are cruel and mean grudge holders.  They continue to harass because of the power or ability, but it will backfire on both, whoever the culprit is.  The epitome of the flaws in today's society and radio in general.  It is a petty feud with jabs by Hampton against Allen.  It's a big sport to them.  It's sad they or the engineer (whoever hs may be) continue this charade of aggravation.    Television is here to stay; it is the single most important medium of communication in the contemporary civilization.  Movies today exaggerate a situation or disaster, so that it is hard to know the truth or actual facts.  Cosell wasn't afraid to tell it like it is.  The movie, however, has much to be desired.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is one of the more unique movies out there.  There's nothing predictable in this story, no boring dialogue, no slow parts.  The story line is truly original, and every piece of imagery and dialogue kept me thinking.  I couldn't tell where Donnie's obsession with time travel was going, nor could I imagine that every bizarre scene of the movie would be tied together in the end.  It's not that Donnie Darko was overly complex, just an intelligent film that leaves you with lots of things to think about.  This is definitely one that I will watch again.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam is one of those bands that can experiment, sometimes drastically, from CD to CD and still have it be a phenominal record, but once they head back to that style that they got big with (i.e., Ten's heaviness), it's a breath of fresh air. With Pearl Jam's first studio album with all new songs in what seems like decades, it's safe to say that they remain in top form to this day. But come on, is that really that surprising?<br /><br />This self-titled CD is chock full of memorable track after memorable track. From the opening of Life Wasted to the closing of Inside Job, Ed yells, sings, and croons his way through all 13 tracks as if a day hadn't passed since the release of Riot Act. As for the rest of the gang, they sound angrier and louder than they have in years. Even from the first few seconds of Life Wasted it's easily heard that they've seemingly dropped the polished feel and went with a more pure sense of rawness. The adrenaline is easy to spot and the emotion is more real than it was even on the classic Black from Ten.<br /><br />With the sometimes extreme political tones to almost every track on here, Ed doesn't seem to overdue any of it. Yeah it's there, and you don't have to decode anything to understand where the band is coming from, but where other bands tend to preach, it honestly feels like they're just telling a story through the songs. It seems like anymore, the only other person not afraid to take aim specifically at the government is Neil Young, so to have some very influential voices of reason coming out with CDs with such strong messages is encouraging.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Life Wasted, Marker In The Sand, Unemployable, Gone, and Come Back. I won't deny that this CD isn't without it's faults. However, I can still listen straight through the entire disc and feel completely satisfied with what I've heard. But, when you start dissecting each song then yeah, faults become much more apparent. I'm happy enough to just have some new material from the guys that I can overlook those few missteps included. I think every other fan will admit as well that even if they don't necessarily like this CD, that they're still glad to have Pearl Jam back.ew material from the guys that I can overlook those few missteps included.

B00005NWLO|5.0|The Amazon review describes Lynyrd Skynyrd as a \\"redneck Led Zeppelin.\\" There's some truth in that: Zep was the best rock band to come out of Britain, while Skynyrd was America's best rock band. Unlike the Allman Brothers Band (whose fans have seen fit to show up here talking trash), Skynyrd created a sound that was truly unique, fusing rock, blues, gospel, country and even a touch of jazz into a sound that was at once accessable and identifiable. This album was one I had as a kid, and it's unfortunately as close as any of us will get to seeing a real Skynyrd show. How unfortunate that the band felt too pressured to let the planned filming of the shows go on! I'd encourage anyone who thinks this band was only \\"Free Bird\\" and \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" to explore the rest of their music. Lynyrd Skynyrd is a benchmark against which all American rock bands can be measured, just as Zeppelin is for British rock, from the depth of their musical style and influences to their impact on the players who grew up in their wake. One last word, for this goofed-up PeeCee world: The Rebel flag wasn't anything racist when they flew it. It was simply a declaration of southern pride, during a time when the American south was popularly perceived to be of little consequence, culturally or otherwise. Dig up \\"Second Helping\\" and listen to \\"The Ballad of Curtis Loew\\" if you don't believe me; that type of ballad is written about one's heroes, and racists don't tend to have old black blues players as heroes.

Sarah Waters' description of how horrid a Victorian 'gaol' actually was is chilling and yet when you really think on it, it was probably even more terrible than that.  I can only imagine what it was like to totally 'lose it' and be meanly shuffled off to 'the darks' bound in a Victorian version of the straight jacket.  Also the supernatural factor of this story is amazing and one gets a taste of Peter Quick.  What a great taste it is.  This book is a MUST if you enjoyed The Alienist by Caleb Carr.
0671027387|4.0|Dan Brown has had some bad press lately, most of it questioning his ability as a writer. As they say, there is no such thing as bad publicity. I have now read them all and found all of them interesting with excellent plots. Digital Fortress is possibly the best of the lot and to go too deeply into the plot would spoil it for the reader.<br /><br />To give a very general synopsis is probably the best way to approach the plot of the book, so here goes: The US Presidential elections are coming up and the President's chances are not looking too good. The Senator who is vying with him for the Presidency is running a successful campaign against NASA. Virtually saying that the space agency is now a white elephant drawing vast sums of money from the US taxpayer and giving virtually nothing in return.<br /><br />The President then makes a television broadcast stating that NASA have made an earth shattering discovery. The announcement blow his opponents campaign right out of the water.<br /><br />That is a very brief and broad resume of the book. I will just say that the discovery is made under 200ft. of ice in the Arctic and is mind blowing. To say anymore would spoil the story for the reader.

B00005JM1F|5.0|I am a HUGE Will Ferrell fan.  I am also a huge Vince Vaughn fan, so when you get them together with a script allowing them to take over and expose their comedic genius then I am all for it.  Sure, Luke Wilson is the star but put him on the screen with either of the aformentioned and he fades into the backdrop.  The film revolves around three friends, each of which are having women troubles.  You have Frank (Ferrell) who has just got hitched but his marriage is already having trouble.  Then theres Mitch (Wilson) who just caught his girlfriend (Julitte Lewis) having some S&M fun with a few people in their house.  And finally we have Beanie (Vaughn) who is successful and married to a beautiful woman (Leah Remini) and has two children but is missing the fun he once had with booze and young women.  So, in an effort to bring themselves up from the slump they are in they decide to throw a large party at Mitch's new house near the local college campus.  The party is a success and they are the new kings of the town.  (The whole 'Frank the Tank' scene is the greatest scene in the film)  There's one problem, and his name is 'Dean' Gordon Pritchard (Jeremy Pivon in a hilarious role).  Gordon has history with the three party animals and is determined to have them evicted.  So, in an effort to save their home they start a fraturnity which turns into the base for one hilarious film.  Cameos from the likes of Snoop Dogg and Sean Williams Scott as well as the always funny Andy Dick give this film even more cred.  Throw in the spark of a new love for Mitch with the beautiful Nicole (Ellen Pompeo) and her jealous and perverted boyfriend Mark (Craig Kilborn) and throw in Elisha Cuthburt for good messure and you have a non-stop laugh fest that will never get old.

B000AYEIZY|5.0|If you asked several average music listeners to name the best and most influential bands of the 60's, you'd be hard-pressed to find Cream on those lists. Cream was a staple in the diet of the average 60's music fan, but nowadays, hardly anyone remembers their name (although their song \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" has become a hit despite no one knowing who they are). When compared to other in their vein of music (Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, etc.) Cream was definitely a step above the rest. Each of the band members were highly talented and beyond the rest of their kind, offering non-standard instrumental stylings like nothing the world had even seen up to that point. No band took the blues-influenced rock style farther than Cream, and no other band did a better job of it. Though Cream may have faded into obscurity among modern music listeners, any true music fan must appreciate the influence and skill that this band has.<br /><br />Though it seemed impossible, the band got back together over a year ago for their long-anticipated reunion. Many fans, young and old, traveled far and wide to witness history in the making as the 60's greatest players made a return to their glory days. Some were skeptical of the band's ability to play their old songs after nearly 40 years of hiatus, but the trio proves everyone wrong by performing impeccable versions of classic hit songs like \\"Crossroads\\" and \\"Toad\\" (an impressive feat for a 67 year-old who looks like he should be in a retirement home rather than beating some excellent rhythms from his drum set). Jack Bruce, lead singer and bass player, can still belt out tunes like \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" and \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" and moves his fingers nimbly about the fretboard of his bass with a professionality seen in very few bass players (it's hard to find a truly great bass player in this day in age), proving that he is still one of rock's greatest bass players. Secondly is critically-acclaimed guitarist Eric Clapton, who often makes the lists of rock's top 10 guitarists because of his pure talent and melodic voice that interchanges with Jack Bruce on various songs. I was glad that he did this reunion, because I wasn't really a big fan of Clapton's solo career because it was a step down from his wonderful blues-inspired guitar stylings of his Cream days, especially the cream of the crop (don't mind the overused pun) \\"Crossroads\\", possibly Cream's greatest hit. Now he proves that he can still play the complex solos and improvisations of yesteryear after a long, unimpressive discography. (am I the only person who doesn't like that song \\"Layla\\"?) Lastly is drummer Ginger Baker, who is possibly the most impressive of the three. Not many can play the drums as well as he did and still does, even at the age of sixty-seven. Ginger Baker is often placed too low on lists of the world's greatest drummers, seeing as he was highly influential and had a style all his own, beating out others like John Bonham (who was most likely influenced by Baker) and modern loves like Lars Ulrich (who really isn't that great of a drummer in the grand scheme of things). Unlike many drummers of that age, he doesn't just sit there and beat on the drum kit merely to keep the beat and add that extra punch; there is real progression in his drumming and subtle complexities that you to really listen for. Even in his old age, \\"Toad\\" is still compelling, though not as fast as before, and really blows you away.<br /><br />Bottom line: Cream was one of the 60's greatest bands and has become underappreciated since their glory days, so this live reunion album is a good way to reintroduce them into the modern music scene as great even today. If you're a longtime (or even original) Cream fan then you probably already own this, but for all you out there who are looking to be inspired in spite of the adversity of today's mainstream, then pick this album up as well as their wonderful studio recordings, mainly \\"Wheels of Fire\\". Cream may not have been around long, but the impact they made on the progression of rock remains one of the strongest.<br /><br />10/10have been around long, but the impact they made on the progression of rock remains one of the strongest. <br /> <br />10/10
0792844882|5.0|Paul Verhoeven and Joe Estherhaus reteam after the ultra-success of their tribute to soft-core sex and mega-violence BASIC INSTINCT (which is eminently watchable for Michael Douglas and its incredible over-the-topness) for one of easily the most embarrassing films ever made... SHOWGIRLS. Estherhaus apparently named the lead character Nomi (Elizabeth Berkley) in tribute to his wife, Naomi.<br /><br />If I were her, I'd get that lawyer on the phone.<br /><br />This film goes beyond depravity to just being unbelievably bad. But like some truly awful films, its redemption is found in the fact that it is so awful, so bereft of anything that resembles quality or talent, that it's just plain hilarious to watch. Every single line is cringe-worthy, every single performance is easily the worst of their respective careers (of course here, the real standout of the cast is Elizabeth Berkeley... her performance is amazingly devoid of anything that resembles realism OR talent... she's just incredibly horrible) and ironically for a film that received an NC-17 rating, there is NO eroticism whatsoever. There's lots and lots of nudity, but nothing in this film is sexy.<br /><br />This is essentially a unexciting soft-core version of ALL ABOUT EVE, but with the trademark inconceivably bad dialogue of Eztherhaus and the balls-out visual wham-bam-thank you ma'am style of Verhoeven. This film isn't just over the top. It's an entire universe unto itself.<br /><br />And I love it.
B000286S8S|3.0|Check the inside of your inserts closely because many of the songs are supposed to be presented in their single versions but none are, such as \\"Right Now.\\"  I hate it when that happens because a lot of times, single versions can only be found on greatest hits cds.  That is a bad selling point for me, but for the casual fan, the collection has a good mix on it.
0790729342|5.0|This film is great! Its a post apocalyptic story that  takes place in the dessert where only the tuff and ruthless survive. People race around on bikes, a little plane, and fast spiked out cars fighting for oil. They take whatever they can and destroy anything that comes in their path.<br /><br />Its got a perfect cast and script. It was made by a teriffic director George Miller, who puts heart into his movies. It was a low budget film so all the special effects were real and not computerized. You get to see Mel Gibson in his prime wearing a hot leather outfit before he became famous. The characters really are all perfect, especially the gay biker with the red mohawk and open chaps and the little kid with the mullet. The costumes are great. This film was one of the first of its kind. Many films had immitated it but none were as good.<br /><br /> Mad Max has everything a film could ask for- its an action packed film with humor, romance, nudity, and horror. It is one of the few films that are actually better than the first. Its got the longest chase scene in a movie that lasts 20 minutes and you never get bored! This film remains one of my favorites and will always be a classic.

Hostel doesn't even come close to the Tarantino-produced 1996 Vampire classic, [[ASIN:B00004RJ74 From Dusk Till Dawn]].<br /><br />Hostel is a movie about a whole town that doesn't seem to notice that a giant abandoned factory has been converted into a torture chamber where the wealthy pay to mutilate people for fun. Who knew that there was such a demand for this kind of entertainment by the upper echelons of society!?<br /><br />The story is the simple tale of what happens when a few B-actors acting like B-actors get abducted to be victims for the sadistic masses that patronize the torture factory.<br /><br />There is gore-o-plenty. If you're into scenes of torture you won't be disappointed here.<br /><br />All in all, it's a ridiculously conceived plot line with gratuitous gore. The thrills are few...suspense is about a 0. You could watch this movie without sound all the way through and still have the same experience as if the sound is on. The movie is mostly a visual yuck-fest.<br /><br />Want a good alternative that has a story and *a lot* less gore than you probably think? Go with [[ASIN:B000EOTVU2 Wolf Creek]].
630529142X|4.0|This movie is Adam Sandler at his best - vulgar, stupid, inane...and also very funny and even touching.<br /><br />Bobby Boucher is a bayou mama's boy who is seems mildly retarded. However, he has found a place for himself as water boy for a football team. Though not bright, he is sensitive, and is very hurt at the constant abuse he receives from the players. When he joins up with a team that has lost its last 40 games, he is able to channel his hurt into vicious tackles that start to turn the teams fortunes.<br /><br />The fun of the movie is the inspired performances of the supporting cast. There's Kathy Bates (in a comedic tour de force) as the over-protective Mama Boucher whose Cajun cuisine runs to crocs, snakes and squirrels. There's Henry Winkler, as the loser coach, who never recovered from losing his gridiron playbook to a rival. There's the lovely Fairuza Balk who plays Boucher's stir-crazy, gator chompin' girlfriend Vicki Vallencourt. The movie is filled in with smaller roles that help the movie add up to more than a pack of clich&eacute;s: an arrogant college professor who looks like Colonel Sanders; gay state cops, a Cajun'spewing assistant coach, swamp rat fans, and others.<br /><br />The soundtrack is pretty interesting, with contributions by Charlie Daniels (that Devil/fiddle tune), the Allman Brothers and John Mellencamp. The DVD includes the trailer and a very short featurette - and is nothing to write home about.<br /><br />Sandler has to be credited with keeping the heart in a movie about a dimwit loser. \\"The Waterboy\\" will make you laugh, and it may even make you cry.

B000050FEN|5.0|I rate this movie 5 stars, or 9,5/10. The movie is included among the 1000 Best Movies on DVD by Peter Travers. This New Line Platinum Series edition is really beautiful, with a DVD case simulating the notebook that John Doe uses in the movie, and with a second disc full of supplemental material. I miss the typical but in my opinion mandatory \\"How it was made\\" or \\"Behind the Scenes\\" documentary. You see deleted scenes and extended takes, alternate endings with awesome animated storyboards, etc. The movie in Disc One comes with an audio track specially recorded for the DVD edition, and in my Home Theatre sounds terrific. Also we have 4 different audio commentaries, by director Fincher, Freeman, Pitt and other collaborators on the film.<br /><br />This is a terrific thriller focused on two detectives (one new -Pitt- another about to retire -Freeman-) after a serial killer (always brilliant Spacey) who is obsessed with books about the seven capital sins, and kills people who represents them. After the 5th murder, he turns himself in and the last two (Envy and Wrath) are just a masterpiece of an invention. I've probably seen this movie just 3 or 4 times, but I can't help to be absolutely mesmerized and surprised by the genious of the story.<br /><br />This is a masterpiece of a movie. I rarely give 10/10 points to movies, so I gave this 9.5/10. To be picky, I'd like a \\"Hit\\" song with the closing credits. But that is just me being picky. The music by Howard Shore is good. The photography is excellent, the script is in my opinion the very best, and Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are fabulous. The movie was nominated for Best Film Editing for the Academy Awards but won nothing.<br /><br />A must for any thriller fan and highly recommended to any movie fan. Your collection is not complete without this one. And for the price ($13.99 while I am writing this) you can't get any wrong.

B00004UEIC|5.0|With one plucked note from that thumb you know instantly that it is Wes!<br /><br />This is the record that I tell anyone into Jazz, guitar or just plain music, that they have to listen to.<br /><br />A great group, Tommy Flanagan and the Heath brother. This album shines!<br /><br />Wes was total working class, cared more for family then his music. This is a testament to a true guitar great!
B000F1IQNM|4.0|Because of its silly packaging and dependency on graphics that appear to dumb down the prospective audience, NANNY McPHEE may not gain the position on the lineup of really good movies before the public right now. But for those who can ignore the packaging, inside is a DVD that is a smart, cleverly written with style and grace by star Emma Thompson (based on the novels Nurse Matilda), directed with aplomb by Kirk Jones, and with a cast of irresistible, irascible children and adults, magical movie that is way over the top in color and slapstick in some places but remains a fluffy delight!<br /><br />The story is simple on the surface: Colin Firth plays Mr. Brown a recently widowed father of seven children whose business (a funeral director) keeps him away from home, resulting in a clan of kids who are as boisterously misbehaved as any children ever encountered. All nannies hired run away in terror at encountering the children: their only constants are the scullery maid Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald) and the cook Mrs. Blatherwick (Imelda Staunton). Brown is under the thumb of Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury) who threatens to cut off her necessary financial support unless Brown remarries immediately. In a wonderfully otherworldly manner the name of Nanny McPhee resounds and the grossly unattractive, warty, obese and bucktoothed (only one!) strange nanny appears to assist. She speaks softly and carries a big walking stick, an implement that can bring magical changes when tapped on the floor. She sates she will stay despite the fact the children need her but don't want her and will leave when the children want her but don't need her. The manner in which this gentle and odd nanny affects the changes she demands (going to bed on time, getting up on time, saying please and thank you, etc) works wonders - not only for the children but also for Brown's response to the demands of the aunt.<br /><br />Emma Thompson is wonderful as the ugly but gradually beautified nanny, Colin Firth shines as the father, and the supporting cast of seven superb child actors (Thomas Sangster, Eliza Bennett, Jennifer Rae Daykin, Raphael Coleman, Sam Honywood, Holly Gibbs, and the infant sisters Barnes), Imelda Staunton (`Vera Drake') , Celia Imrie (`Calendar Girls'), Angela Lansbury, and even Derek Jacobi and Patrick Barlow in small supporting roles make this fairy tale entertaining and instructive! 'Tis a pity the movie sinks to recreation of the old and very tired food fight sequence at the wedding, but after all this is mainly a film for children and as such guarantees belly laughs. It is a lot of fun and has some important lessons for children AND adults, and it makes for a light but delightful evening of sharing.

B000268QB2|4.0|I really like this group and love this album.  There is a downside to it though.  When listening to the whole album at a time, the songs seem to just merge into one never-ending song.  Many albums have this same issue though.  I reccomend that to truly enjoy each song on the album, try mixing them up with some other artists in between.
B00005JP01|4.0|Loud, Brash, Noisy, Sexy, Morally Murky, Bursting with Energy and Guts, Justin Lin's (the terrific \\"Better Luck Tomorrow\\") take on episode 3 of the \\"Fast and Furious\\" franchise is a great way to spend a hot Summer afternoon along with a gallon size soft drink and a tub of Popcorn.<br /><br />Here Lin is in Tokyo with the stoic, deadpan line reading Lucas Black (as the booted out of the US to avoid Juvenile detention, Shane Boswell...a car nut addicted to driving fast and grinning like a Cheshire cat) who, of course finds the local car culture and its inhabitants by way of a school pal, Twinkie played by the appealing Bow-Wow. And he just as quickly falls in with the \\"wrong crowd\\" consisting of Han, a sort of Sensei to Shane (the enigmatic and excellent Sung Kang from \\"Face\\" and \\"Better Luck Tomorrow\\"), and  the villain of the piece, Yamata  played with his face crunched and a constant sneer by Sonny Chiba. Then there is the lovely Neela (Nathalie Kelley...a dead ringer for FFI's Jordana Brewster): like Shane and Twinkie a High School (!)student with very, very permissive parents.<br /><br />Lin directs this piece to within an inch of its life: your eyes and ears are never bored, never without something to feast your eyes upon or pop your fingers to.<br /><br />Lin never judges his characters, we never feel that he is slumming...he always respects the material he is given to direct and he always puts his personal stamp on everything that he does.<br /><br />I wish he were given something as meaningful and heartfelt as \\"Better Luck Tomorrow\\" to direct but he's young and he has many many movies to make before he is through.
B000002AHM|5.0|This is my first encounter with flamenco guitar playing. To say the least, im still icing my jaw from when it hit the floor when i heard the guitars for the first time. These songs are something to listen and be inspired by awe. The technique is second to none, the harmonies make Iron Maiden (whom I love) look like a garage band. These are some of the most influential and respected guitar players to ever pick up the instrument. The songs are long and sometimes u find yourself daydreaming. But when you concentrate and listen to the playing, i dare you to not be amazed. If you are a guitar player of any style, listen to this cd. It will amaze you and make u strive for the excellence that is Al Di Meola, Paco de Lucia, and John McLaughlin
B00005JOQS|5.0|Can't give you what this movie's all about, but when it comes to watching movies, this happens to be the worst time to go out and see a real good film. Quite Frankly, Moviegoers would rather spend their Saturdays watching HBO or Renting Movies for their prime-time fix. Brandon Routh is the right guy to play Clark Kent (AKA Superman) Routh has inherited Christopher Reeve's role as The Man Of Steele. Ultimately Reeve, and His Wife, Dana are BOTH now dead, and WB plans to dedicate this film in their memory, just before they roll the \\"As Time Goes by\\" Intro just before the movie starts. Can't hardly wait.
B000009RC2|5.0|I've been known to be \\"long-winded\\" with some of my reviews, but I will keep this one short. In a few words, this album (along with a handful of others) turned my musical world upside down. I had NEVER heard anything quite like this before...raw, beautiful, delicate, brutal...these are just a few words to describe this album. I also began to approach playing the drums with some of the \\"concepts\\" I was hearing on IMF (please don't misunderstand what I'm saying here...NOBODY plays like Cobham, and I'm NO exception, however, I was able to \\"cop\\" some ideas from him and integrate it into my style---more than once did I recieve an unpleasant look from one of my fellow musicians when I threw in some \\"un-needed\\" 32cnd notes where they were probably not needed. Anyway, this is a super-charged release (along with Birds of Fire) that I would strongly recommend to anyone looking for passionate music...but be prepared for the Assault!  Enjoy, Jeff
9707704667|1.0|I  been following Llosa's writing and read most of his books including \\"Liberty for Latin America\\" a work center on the old mantra of communism and democracy that failed to prove a solution for Latin America.  I give him credit for his skill at writing but his ideologies are align with special interests (Big corporations) and the exploitation of the resources of those that can't defend themselves (the poor). In America, he is at best a NEO-Conservative that align  himself with the policies of Bush, Chenney, Rusmfeld & Co.  that prove profitable to big corporations but failed miserably at providing freedom and democracy for anyone including Americans. <br /> <br />Want to read something good \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" that shall give you a fun reading while learning facts not fiction. <br /> <br />
B000E1YVZU|1.0|Personally, I didn't understand the film or the musical. The message I understand, but the singing, dancing, music, and plot in general didn't really move me, convince me, or uplift me. I understand that in even the most depressing themes in a musical, the music still remains exuberant and positive. But something about the music in RENT didn't seem to fit. I found them to be lackluster and not catchy at all. The characters were bland and boring to me. Not much personality, felt more like watching sterotypes on screen with no depth, emotion, or feeling. One of the actresses who played a lesbian was truly the most horrible and over the top actor I've ever seen, just ridiculous and annoying. I'm glad i watched this with a few co-eds than by myself, it made it a tiny bit more enjoyable. Personally though, i hate the movie, and i just don't understand the musical. Great themes, but just so dry, lackluster, and at times just a bit unrealistic and boring.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Hostel is my favorite horror movie of the year. It is not just about women getting naked like some of the reviews say. People who only see naked women are missing the plot. The women are there for a reason, they have motives. This is a minor spoiler, so if you don't want to know skip to the next paragraph. The women are there to trap the guys, that is why they use their assets. <br /> <br />The ending to this movie is one of the most satisfying I've seen all year! The revenge is worth the price of admission. I highly recommend this movie to horror fans.
B00005R1N3|4.0|This is one film I wanted to see for a very long time. I heard it was a slasher film as slasher films now a days suck like hell, but this was made before Halloween and Friday the 13th, which kept me interested. It took me a long time to find it, but when I did I could see that this is more than your average slasher.<br /><br />The film is based around Christmas. Sorority girls are planning to take a holiday break. But a stranger who makes frightning phone calls leads to a more psychotic event that night.<br /><br />We are introduced to the killer through first person perspective as this is the way we always see him. This isnt your typical slasher movie with typical hack'n'slash death scenes of blood and gore but instead gives us a great amount of dark eerie events of intense psychological horror within these killings. Again, another horror film that shows horror doesn't require bloodshed.<br /><br />Although Black Christmas doesn't exactly contain truly terrifying scenes but instead contains a great creepy effect of silence throughout the sorority house and with probably the most creepy annonymous phone calls ever in a film. The tension and eerieness builds up brilliantly with great replacements of light, shadow and sound, leaving us to the end, with a creepy essence of dark atmosphere, with some things unanswered.<br /><br />And while Black Christmas contains no cheap attempts of modern day jump frights, this is a great horror film of its kind. Totally recommended.
B000FBGBPC|4.0|I really fell in love with TDG when there first single \\"I hate everything about you\\" was released.  I got the album and I liked it pretty well.  When I heard that they were releasing their second album I got real excited and couldn't wait to hear there new stuff.  They added a band member, changed their look, but they kept the catchy rocking tunes that I knew I could count on them for. \\"Animal I Have Become\\" is an awesome tune, and a great first single for the album.  They have matured since the last record, in their writing, and the whole atmosphere of the songs.  Some of my favorite songs off the album are...\\"Pain\\", \\"Riot\\", \\"Over and Over\\", and \\"Gone Forever\\".   I am only giving the album a 4 out of 5 because I think they will only continue to get better and that this is not their best yet.
B000002J7U|4.0|Many of the other reviews can already give one a sense of this album. I just wanted to chime in with a small 10 cents worth.  <br /> <br />A lot of the tracks here are good, but forgettable. \\"Dream in an Open Place\\" is a Vangelis classic. There have been many times when I'll dig this album up just to hear this song. Few pieces from Vangelis, few from the entire world of music, contain such subtle and profound and gentle, exquisitely gentle moments, moments musically analogous to..well...so much beauty. I'd love to know what Vangelis was thinking when he wrote this. It's an embrace, it's a longing, it's a thank you, it's a moment of incredible clarity, it's so many things which just can't be described with words... <br /> <br />It's hard not to swell from within..... <br /> <br />It is it's title, \\"A Dream in an Open Place.\\"
B000BMSTMS|1.0|okay, first i just have to say that KoRn is one of my favorite bands, that is right up until this album.  this is their worst album that they have ever released.  the only song on it that i like is \\"twisted transistor\\" and that is only because i saw the video first and it is funny as hell.  all of the songs on it are horrible, they are quieter and and not even metal.  if you are a fan of KoRn i highly suggest that you do DO NOT buy this CD.  if you are just getting in to KoRn i suggest you start by downloading or buying anything from \\"Take A Look In The Mirror\\" (their best CD) or \\"Issues\\" (another great).  i mean this isnt even KoRn, its just regular rock not metal, old KoRn is great metal.   <br /> <br />I agree 90% with Lisa Combs' review (not 100% because i liked the \\"Twisted Transistor\\" video and thought it was funny) so read hers to get some more on why not to buy this CD.  On the opposite note, i couldn't agree less with \\"TheoZag\\", i mean come on this isnt KoRn and they shouldnt even be on MTV. <br /> <br />some other great bands are metallica, godsmack, disturbed,  guns n' roses (not metal), rob zombie, judas priest and iron maiden.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This soundtrack has proven to me that not all muscials are stupid. MY absolute favorite song is \\"What is This Feeling\\". I listen to that song about 20 times a day! <br />If you are considering buying this CD, I say you definitely should!!!!!
0451191153|5.0|An excellent book.  Though some of Rand's beliefs may seem a bit extreme, think of the book as a guide, not a bible.  It's changed the way I view life and my place in society.  It's changed my priorities and goals very much as well.  Also a must read: Atlas Shrugged.
B000FGGE68|5.0|A thrill to watch. Sci fi fans will rejoyce and well...milla jovovich. no more must be said.
B000A78Z82|5.0|Another reviewer praised a song on this record for McCartneyesque-whatever.   Its 2006, D.B is a star now, and Paul McCartney doesn't really have new output thats interesting for anyone outside of the VFW bluehaired crowd. Cripple Crow, believe me I know, is brilliant in every conceivable way, even in making reviewers who dont like it realize what sad pathetic lives they have sitting around listening to 70 year olds who had their glory in 1960 and retired and old 28Special vinyls or whoever that is.  Cripple Crow isnt for the fans of has beens but rather fresh and really truly more genuinally psychedelic than any crap from some retired old guy sir mccartsaschmuck could ever make even in his prime, who was a beatle...and Banhart doesnt need Beetles or wings or some kinda concept hogwash \\"band\\".  When the whole \\"band is the guys name...thats like when the band isn't the star but the guy whose name provides the name of said band...like really great this is like great.  Believe me i know.  Its nothing like paul whateverhisname is, or some worn out old crap, or the geriatric stones who everyone goes around saying \\"ooooo, the new one rocks!!!\\"  Like yeah, rocks like mullet and bic lighter concert crowd \\"wow ma, kickass. can i get a mullet too like your loser alcoholic boyfriend?!!!\\"-rocks.  No, this really rocks,  and doesn't smell like \\"some old guy shoulda retired and invested money in a restaurant chain\\" mildew(i.e: not fresh) But rocks like ?\\"yeah im fresh and was born in the last decade or three.\\" -rocks. <br />  Not to rip on \\"\\"Paul-ese\\" McCart that awful sounding rubbish outta here\\" - Ney\\"\\"    but theres no basis for comparison. <br />If a movie was made that needded the good stuff we'de want this, not the easy rider soundtrack,   like its silly.  This is good and was recorded by someone young and fresh with new ideas. Dont listen to fools just buy it.  Trust me im good and listen to music thats really good.  Im from L.A. too and still dont say \\"ooooo it reminded me of the melodious solo wrok of Paul mccart-who? or worse yet Brian wilson.   Plllllleeeease.  So darn good.
B000003S0I|5.0|First of all, let me slam the guy who gave this one star because it has too much dynamic range. Note: I am a professional recording engineer and trust me....dynamic range is GOOD. Most pop albums are compressed to the point of being unmusical. Okay, end of rant. Now on to this disc: King Crimson is one of the best bands ever to make music, and this is one of their best CDs. We can argue whether it's THE best or one of the top three, but come on, we're splitting hairs here. If you are open to challenging and wondrous music, buy this. Now. I mean it.
B00012BSHG|4.0|this pool is a great step up from a baby pool.  my girls are 2 1/2 and 6 and love it.  it's deep enough for really getting wet and not too huge like some inflateables.  it's very comfortable for even a 6' adult to lounge around in.  i bought it because of the drainage plug - a major timesaver, and the inflateable bottom.  i gave it 4 stars because the seam on the inner ring split a tiny bit after a week, but my girls did jump in it like trampoline for 3 days before we filled it.  i would buy another.
B00003CY0U|4.0|A very good film, Swordfish, brings to the screen the story of hacker who is hired by the underworld to break a bank code resulting in the release of millions of dollars.  <br />Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry (who is GORGEOUS!), John Travolta and the rest of the cast, carry out their performances very well.  <br />The highlight of the movie has to be Halle Berry's nude scene at the pool. <br />In short, the setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful! <br />Swordfish is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment! <br />
B0002ONC4K|4.0|Up until a few months ago, I had never even heard of East Of Eden. I just HAPPEN to get a CD-R copy marked simply as 'East Of Eden' from a friend. At first, I thought it possibly MIGHT'VE been a Gong spinoff project, you know... how they've had several short-lived ones? I was later informed the CD-R was, in fact a live bootleg CD. This had to have been my FIRST time I've ever gotten a bootleg of a band that I ACTUALLY liked BEFORE knowing anything about the band. So, I then knew I needed to find out more about this 'experimental progressive' UK ensemble. 'Mercator Projected' was originally released in 1969 as this was the band's first record. After listening to this CD reissue for the first two times, I can NOW understand why East Of Eden never made it big. Their music is simply too way-ahead-of-it's-time for most listeners. Might say they're too inventive for their own good. Most inspiring tracks here are \\"Northern Hemisphere\\", the awesome \\"Waterways\\", \\"Centaur Woman\\", the album's lengthiest cut \\"In The Stable Of The Sphinx\\" and one of the three bonus tunes, a decent cover of the Byrd's \\"Eight Miles High\\". If this doesn't prove these guys meant business, I have no idea what would. Players: Geoff Nicholson - guitar & vocals, Dave Arbus - violin & flute, Ron Caines - sax & vocals, Steve York - bass and Dave Dufort - drums. Might appeal to fans of Third Ear Band, Lard Free, Can, King Crimson or Soft Machine.
B000021YQV|5.0|Toxicity is SoaD's best album including the songs \\"Chop Suey\\" <br />\\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Arials\\" If you think thier newer albums are any good, you are wrong,(don't get me wrong, i respect System of a Down more then i respect myself) <br />Toxicity has more bass then all of there ather albums And the Guitarist(Daron Malakian) does a fantastic job. And besides This album has Serj Tankian On Vocals instead of Daron Malaian(Daron is good with guitars, but is not a very good singer)(Daron i still love you)But if you buy toxicty you will end up falling in love and will probably buy all of their cd's......
6304578458|2.0|I'm simply amazed at the reviews this film has received so far; nearly 5 stars???  You gotta be kidding! <br />The movie, a black comedy, brings to the screen the story of a hit man who never got over his high school sweetheart and who returns home after many years to carry out... a hit.  It is there that he bumps into his \\"ex\\" and the rest can be seen on screen.   <br />The acting is surprisingly (!) average, the dialogues below average, while the plot is just bearable.   <br />In short: <br />John Cusack's character was really not the great. <br />Minnie Driver was unexpectedly plain and bland. <br />Dan Aykroyd was given terrible lines and a weak character to play. <br />Joan Cusack's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on. <br />Though the potential for a decent movie was there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. <br />
B0001CNRSE|3.0|There are some good and slick moves no doubt but it pales when it comes to real dancing. Jessica looks pretty and hot but there are some silly little kids whom people are raving about particularly one kid whose move Jessica is supposed to have copied in one of her dance sequences in the movie (that's how the story goes). That was one sick lousy move and one that will make you cringe. Honestly that kid sucked. There are tons of kids on Mtv and other TV dance shows that will have your jaws dropping. Check it out for Jessica, otherwise this is no big \\"dance-movie\\". There's a sweet romance between Jess and her lover that is worth watching though. If you are looking for good drama and dance check out \\"Save the Last Dance\\".  <br /> <br />Wanted to give just 2 stars.
B00004NHCC|5.0|This 2003 release of Vaughan's December, 1954, album (previously released in 1991 as \\"Sarah Vaughan with Clifford Brown\\") is one of her most brilliant collaborations and a fine memorial to the work of Brown, who died eighteen months after recording this, at age twenty-six. With Brown on trumpet, Paul Quinichette on tenor sax, Jimmy Jones on piano, Roy Haynes on drums, and Herbie Mann on jazz flute, the album is a sophisticated partnership among musicians, all of whom are thinking of the whole sound and the whole effect, rather than their own star turns. The mood varies from light to poignantly tender, the tempo is usually slow, and the volume is kept low, highlighting the creativity of each performer's variations while remaining true to the songs and their meanings.<br /><br />\\"Lullaby of Birdland\\" is lightly swingy in Vaughan's hands, with minimal accompaniment and a restrained mood. Vaughan's voice ranges widely, with a lovely contrast between her lowest range and the flute of Mann, as Brown plays a muted trumpet and remains in the background. \\"April in Paris\\" is sweetly tender, with Vaughan hesitating as she asks \\"What have you done to my heart,\\" her accompanists keeping their solos soft. Both \\"Embraceable You\\" and \\"September Song,\\" slow-tempo songs long associated with Vaughan, allow for much improvisation and highlight Vaughan's enormous range while allowing Brown to soar. The \\"partial alternative take\\" of \\"Lullaby of Birdland\\" features Vaughan's best scat.<br /><br />\\"Jim\\" and \\"I'm Glad There Is You\\" are personal favorites. \\"Jim,\\" a narrative revealing the intimacy of a relationship in which the woman declares she will continue to love a man who will leave her, begins with a duet, Brown's trumpet so close to the timbre of Vaughan's voice that it sounds like another voice, while his later solo, louder than usual, conveys the passion of the song. \\"I'm Glad There is You\\" also features a perfect melding of voice and trumpet as Vaughan hits some of her highest notes in one of the most beautiful combinations of voice and trumpet ever.<br /><br />Vaughan's range, her emotional feel for the music and sensitivity to her fellow musicians, her clarity of voice, her ability to control tempo (delaying her entrance on some phrases, repeating some lyrics as an echo and then \\"catching up\\"), and her recognition that one does not have to shriek to improvise or convey meaning are all highlights of this CD. This elegant album is marked by the restraint of the musicians, all of whom are wildly creative while respecting each other and their songs.  Mary Whipplet notes in one of the most beautiful combinations of voice and trumpet ever.  <br /> <br />Vaughan's range, her emotional feel for the music and sensitivity to her fellow musicians, her clarity of voice, her ability to control tempo (delaying her entrance on some phrases, repeating some lyrics as an echo and then \\"catching up\\"), and her recognition that one does not have to shriek to improvise or convey meaning are all highlights of this CD.

B00005R5G9|5.0|Sometimes even I get tired of chasing the ladies - and you know how much I love the ladies - and I find myself watching this film and wishing that I could get it together with a nice shop dummy who comes to life every now and again. I could keep her in a cupboard.
B000001IPL|5.0|The Offspring's recent albums may be really dissapointing, but because of their older albums, particularly Smash, I will always have respect for them and they will remain one of my favourite bands. People say all the time how 94 was a great year for punk, and this album is one of the reasons why.  <br /> <br />Like all truly great albums, this one is great from beginning to end, starting with the witty \\"Time to Relax\\" down to the punk anthem \\"Smash\\". For one, these guitar riffs are just incredible, and the lead singer Dexter has got a really awesome voice. These two elements come together to create 13 of the best modern punk songs ever. \\"Come Out and Play\\" and \\"Self-Esteem\\" are classics, no question. \\"Nitro (Youth Energy)\\", \\"Gotta Get Away\\", and \\"What Happened To You\\" are some of my personal favourites, but like I said before, all these songs are great. <br /> <br />If you like punk/rock music, then you need to buy this album as soon as you possibly can because it would be a crime not to have this CD. Fans of newer Offspring should also check this out to hear what they were like before. I promise you will not be dissapointed. This is one of the best albums of the 90s, and really, it belongs in any CD collection.
B00005AQF7|5.0|I Purchased this album recently and I am enjoying it incredibly. My Ratings for the songs are   1. Bathtub 8/10 Not A song but still good  2. G Funk Intro 9.5/10 bangin beats    3. Gin & Juice 10/10 my favourite famous song on this album  4. Tha Shiznit 10/10 A favourite, gangsta as beats with Snoop great  5. Lodi Lodi 10/10 Now this is just incredible, The beats are again amazing and Snoop's voice is nothing but amazing.  6. Murder Was The Case 10/10 Again gangsta as, with great lyrics like \\"rollin on a grey goose\\"  7. Serial Killa 9.5/10 Even though there is only one verse by Snoop the beats just about make up for it.  8. Who Am I? (What's My Name?) 10/10 My second favourite famous song  9. For All My N***** & B****** 8/10 My least favourite seeing theres so little Snoop. However the beats deserve 8/10  10 Ain't No Fun (If The Homies Can't Have None) 10/10 Even though some of the lyrics are a bit wrong I have always been a fan of this one  11. Doggy Dogg World 10/10 My third favourite famous song  12. Gz & Hustlas 10/10 A favourite in this one I think he sounds the most angry  13. Pump Pump 10/10 Great song, a bit like Tupac's Holler If Ya Hear Me.  Gz Up Hoez Down 10/10 This track was on the original version and not the reissued and I only have the reissued one but i've got this song and it's great    Snoop was so much better back in his Deathrow days, so if your gonna get another album don't just get any album. The No Limit one's aren't that bad but you need to get more of Snoop Doggy Dogg.   Albums like  Dr Dre's The Chronic  Murder Was The Case Soundtrack  Tha Doggfather  Dead Man Walkin  Death Row's Snoop Doggy Dogg Greatest Hits    He was so much more focused back then and you can't possibly be dissapointed. Anyway my overall rating for this album is 9 and a half out of 10, Peace.
B00005JOX6|3.0|In this one Adam Sandler is self-absorbed architect Michael Newman who is married to the sweet and supportive Donna played by the beautiful Kate Beckinsale, of the UNDERWORLD films. He has 2 beautiful kids, Ben and Samantha, who he doesn't get to see much because he's working lots of overtime in an attempt to be made a partner by David Hasselhoff, his ungrateful boss. One night, tired, frustrated, unable to even figure out which remote will turn on his TV, he sets out to find a \\"universal remote.\\" In an embarrassing production of product placement that would make a NASCAR driver blush, he ends up at \\"Bed, Bath & Beyond,\\" specifically the \\"Beyond\\" room. Here he finds the resident eccentric genius employed there, called Morty, chiefly because Sandler loves having Christopher Walken, who plays the part, say \\"Morty.\\" Morty gives him an unique experimental device to get his life under \\"control.\\" Michael is now able to turn on any & all appliances with the a single \\"click.\\" He gradually learns of the device's other functions: It can \\"MUTE\\" the bark of the family dog, PAUSE everything and fast forward through an argument with the Mrs. he can adjust his HUE as well. Wanting to learn more he visits \\"the Beyond\\" and Morty again. Morty tells Michael that he got exactly what he asked for \\"a remote to control his universe.\\" Morty further demonstrates more features, including one that lets him flip through his existence at varying speeds. Michael is soon corrupted absolutely by the sheer power of the control, literally losing control. Before long he can't stop the remote from selecting what and when he will fast-forward, causing him to miss events he wants to experience, eventually leading the obligatory \\" It's A WONDERFUL LIFE\\" epiphany when does realize all that he's missed and sometimes it is and sometimes isn't a wonderful life, but that's okay, he gets the message and all is forgiven.<br /><br />The film is light formula-fare with heart, like some of Sandler's weaker films, there are laughs to be found. Sandler is okay as the nice-guy with a crude streak.  Hasselhoff is fun as the jerk boss. Some of the gags get repetitive and some aren't that funny the first time. Also an over-large amount of time is spent creating the progressively older Michael Newman.<br /><br />Click is directed for Sandler's Happy Madison production company by Frank Coraci of the Wedding Singer, Waterboy and most recently Around the World in 80 Days (the Jackie Chan). And Sandler again uses Henry \\"the Fonz\\" Winkler (previously in the Happy Madison universe as Coach Klien, and as himself in Little Nicky) and Julie Kavner (best known as the voice of Marge Simpson) to play his unappreciated folks.

B00004Z459|4.0|A very good album. I am really impressed with Linkin Park. This music may be what the future of music sounds like. Very dark and very emotional. Other than the fact that I picture these guys as a little nerdy, it is a very good cd. My favorite songs are crawling, cure for the itch, papercut, one step closer. Its a good cd to rock out to. The way they overdub guitars is very cool. I wouldn't rate metora as highly, but this one is very good. A mix of rap and pop and metal.
B0009A40ES|5.0|I first saw American Psycho in a multiplex in, of all places, Plymouth. I was looking forward to a cool, brilliant, classy, savage satire on yuppiedom, but I think most of the rest of the audience were hoping for a slasher movie. The action was punctuated with cries of \\"Kill 'er!\\" and \\"Stab the slag!\\" Ah, Navy towns. <br />Oliver Stone nearly directed this movie, and we should be glad he didn't, when you consider what a daft mess he made of Quentin Tarantino's unpretentiously nasty original script for Natural Born Killers. He also wanted to cast Leonard DiCaprio, who at the time was one of the biggest stars in the world. How fashions change, eh? Fortunately, it reverted to Mary Harron (who'd proved herself on I Shot Andy Warhol) and she got to have her first choice in the lead, Christian Bale. Bale's performance is one of the most rip-roaring in Nineties cinema; he's like the concentrated essence of yuppie, sun-dried (or is it freeze-dried?) yuppie. That he had to remake his body and create the accent from the ground up suits the character perfectly. Patrick Bateman is, as he says himself, all mask - there is nobody there. The smirking, male-model relish with which Bale delivers lines like \\"The Mud Soup with Charcoal Arugula is outrageous!\\" is a sight to behold. It's surely intentional that he and his pals (chiefly Josh Lucas and Justin Theroux, respectively excellent in Wonderland and Mulholland Dr.) look like nothing so much as a bunch of guys in a Hugo Boss ad, as they sit around and make offensive remarks about women and Jews. (\\"Hey,\\" says Patrick with sweet reasonableness, \\"cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks, okay?\\") <br /> <br />The screenwriters, Harron herself and Guinevere Turner (who, weirdly, had previously co-written and starred in the sweet lesbian love story Go Fish), manage to drag the satirical essence of Ellis' novel onto the screen. It's a book like \\"Naked Lunch\\", in that nobody would let you film it exactly the way it's written. Probably only women could be so funny about how insane men can get. The actual butchery is more hinted at than shown; Bateman meets a model in a club, the next day he's twirling a lock of her hair in his fist, and that evening we notice in passing that her severed head is in his freezer. There's the notorious moment with the twirling chainsaw, and there's the hilarious and appalling Huey Lewis/axe attack moment, but there's not much else to make you lose your dinner. My only regret is that the final shot, with the \\"This Is Not An Exit\\" sign discreetly placed behind Bale's head, is all but lost on the small screen.  <br /> <br />It can also be argued that Bateman's crackup, when he hysterically confesses all his killings over the phone to his lawyer, somewhat draws the teeth of the rest of the movie, in that nobody appears to notice what he's done. The viewer is all but forced to the conclusion that it was all in his head. Bale is brilliant in the scene, even strangely touching, but as a piece of writing (and a moment of utter faithfulness to the book) you can't help wondering whether these people want to make some good satire or just...yawn...play around with, like, textuality. Still, it's one of the best movies about the 80s, and knocks something like \\"Wall Street\\" out of the water. What are Harron and Turner and Bale doing now? Anyone know?
B000F1IQNC|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time. I'd rate it right up there with Ever After! The basic jist, Mr. Brown's wife is dead and he doesn't know how to deal with his kids. They are little monsters!!! Goes through a whole bunch of nannies and can't find one that will stay, understandably. Nanny Mcphee arrives one night and their whole world is turned upside down in some very fun and unusal ways. Whoever thought a magical stick and a dancing, whistling donkey could do the trick?  <br />There's a good bunch of laughable slap stick,lessons to be learned, heart felt moments, and a touch of romance. <br />I loved all the acting. Felt the cast preformed to their utmost best. (Actually felt for the characters) The script was well done.  <br />Grab the family, some popcorn, take a chance and dare to believe!  <br />
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty\\" is another modern day film that it seems to me has fallen foul of the narrow-minded vision of the marketing men and those responsible for the film's trailers. They must really hate it when an almost genre-less film like this comes along and they simply do not know how to classify it or what to write up as the advertising blurb. <br />I was expecting a tale of a teenage femme fetale and her effects on an depressed aging middle-aged male, but also was expecting a sniggering \\"black comedy\\" as the back of the box had told me. <br />I got neither, but what I did get was the most engaging and intelligent film I have seen for a long while. I do have some sympathies with the advertising men as the film is pretty had to classify. It's not a black comedy and yet there are some genuinely amusing scenes. It's not a tale of a middle class American family and yet it almost solely features the Burnham family and those close to them. I guess the best I can do to describe it is call it a modern day saga of the breakdown of relationships. <br /> <br />Every single one of the characters shown has some sort of problem with the way their lives are developing, (apart from the smiley happy gay couple next door.) Lester Burnham is the classic 40 something miserable burned out executive. His wife doesn't love or care for him anymore, she is only concerned that he doesn't embarrass her. His daughter doesn't talk to him anymore and has confessed to her boyfriend she would like him dead. Lester for his own part undermines and belittles his wife at every opportunity, he unashamedly lusts after his daughter's school friend and ridicules and alienates his bosses until they are forced to fire him. Their neighbours, the Fitts, include ex-marine Col Frank Fitts, a stoic military type who forces his son into giving urine samples to test for drug abuse. The son, Ricky, a camera fanatic has taken to filming the local goings on including some dubious footage of the Burnham family. Thereare plenty more besides this motley selection and it is the quirks and oddities of the characters that makes the film what it is, but at the same time the oddities are ones that we can relate to and maybe even rather scarily see in ourselves. Again for nearly all the characters we can find traits we despise and yet because of failings in other areas we feel sympathy for them at the same time. <br /> <br />The performances are to a man extremely accomplished and well executed. Kevin Spacey won a deserved Oscar for his portrayal of Lester Burnham and Annette Bening was also nominated. Their performances and those of the other actors are all played with delicacy, humanity and a great deal of believability.  <br /> <br />Well recommended and a must see for any fans of the cinema.
B00004Y6NP|4.0|I just cant understand why people slam this great album.I am not a dire straits fan and only like theit debut and this album.rest of their cd's are quite bad as to me they soung like lounge music.Money for nothing has great songs in walk of life,title track and so far away.Ignore the recommendations of the reviewer called whirligig and get this with their debut whilst avoiding all their other remaining albums.
6305313687|5.0|The message of American History X is pretty simple: racism is bad, and joining a neo-Nazi gang is not going to solve any of your problems - becoming an English Literature teacher or a film actor would be much more constructive. You may have thought this would be fairly self-evident but Holywood obviously thinks we need yet another lecture on this subject - and by rights this film should have become yet another clumsily preachy morality play. <br />Edward Norton's astounding performance saved it from this fate. His acting at his best when his character Derek is at his worst. Derek is a troubled teen who turns to neo-Nazism when his fireman father is murdered by black gang members, Derek's powerful oration, lightning sharp mind and leadership skills help propel a group of Hitler-worshipping beach bums into one of the most dangerous gangs in Los Angeles. Delivering his poisonous orations, whether against his mother's Jewish boyfriend or to whip up his followers before assaulting a group of innocent Latino shop workers, Norton imbues Derrick's vitriolic rhetoric with power and just enough truth to make any white liberal squirm. However inside prison Derek finds that truth is no more black and white than skin colour and when he crosses white gang leaders he must depend on a black fellow-inmate to save his life. Derek plays his transformation as well as he is allowed by a clumsy script, with sensititvity and tact. <br /> <br />There are some other strong performances in the film, notably from Edward Furlong of Terminator II fame playing Derek's wannabe Nazi younger brother, Fairuza Balk as Derek's wonderfully nasty and unrepentant girlfriend and Guy Torry as the witty, trash-talkin', black petty criminal who saves Derek's life. These are sadly balanced by dreadful overacting by Avery Brooks (Cisco of Deep Space Nine) and Beverly d'Angelo (Ellen Griswold of National Lampoon) as Derek's headmaster and mother respectively. <br /> <br />What really lets the film down is the weakness of the 'bad guys' - other than Balk, Norton's fellow gang members are cardboard-cut out stereotypes of red necks and overweight white trash, and the black gang members they fight are equally two-dimensional villains, as are most of Norton's fellow inmates in prison. You can always tell the bad guys - they're fat, obsessed with tattoos and they smoke. This says more about the prejudices of the Holywood wealthy than it does about anything else. Anyone disagreeing with any part of American liberal orthodoxy is also turned into a carboard racist - noticeably Derek's father; obviously not being a committed supporter of affirmative action is just one step away from joining a neo-Nazi gang and murdering innocent people... oh, and all the good guys are English teachers, or want to become English teachers, or are reading serious English literature to transform themselves from evil gang members into good guys. <br /> <br />All in all though, there is much more good than bad in this film, and it is well worth watching; by the end I cared enough about the main characters to find the finale genuinely upsetting; it just isn't quite as good as they hype implies. <br /> <br />Oh, the cinematography, especially for a relatively low budget film, is beautifully done.
0679422714|4.0|People who grew up in the 1960s might remember that a certain romance attached itself to Mao Zadong among the student rebels of the day. He seemed someone who had steered clear of the bureaucratic lethargy of the Soviets. A Che Guevera who had attained power, through intense struggle and idealism. If any were not thoroughly disillusioned by the Western press reports of the brutality of the Cultural Revolution, this book provides the final antidote.     Mao was no visionary, no intellectual. His intellectual legacy leaves little more than the immensely trivial and vain 'Thoughts of Chairman Mao'. In fact beyond an interest in classical chinese poetry and opera, he'd never read Marx, knew and cared little about economics, or ideas any sort.    What is portrayed here is a massive incompetence and carelessness with the human lives he controlled. A condescension especially for peasants and workers. Someone fixated on his place in history as the final prophet of socialism, imposed with cruelty on an almost unimaginable scale.     The lessons of Stalin's collectivization went unlearned, with his Great Leap Forward of the late 1950s producing nation wide famine. Coupled with this was a characteristic attempt to reduce human life to a number, to rid society of all individuality through rigidity and indoctrination.     The vehicle of this was to erase China's rich history... of art, tradition, literature, theatre.. replaced by numbing conformity. A culture of fear, against any dissension imposed a grey, cowed climate where all initiative was dealt with as a threat.       The book is illuminating of the personality of the man who led this. Someone who seldom bathed or brushed his teeth. Was in thrall of an overarching and grandiose vision of himself, that held no place for compassion. He surrounded himself with sycophants, plotted relentlessly against all whom his paranoid delusions cast their gaze. He took sadistic delight in the humiliation of former comrades, many of whom subsequently died of neglect in prison. His relationships with women are telling. He kept a coterie of women attendants, married to further his aims and subsequently ignored or left them.    He was magnaminous with his aid abroad, while his people starved at home. His efforts to make China a superpower meant military spending was so overwhelming that it completely sabatoged the development of industry, transportation and agriculture. China, at the end of Mao's rule was relegated, in any human analysis, to the poorest of third world nations. Mao was a hero only to the recipients of his largesse in other countries.     The sad state of affairs lasted until Mao's death, when he was being rehabilitated and lauded in the Western political circles to promote detante. At home the scheming and back stabbing continued, as forces, emboldened by his imminent death from ALS, started gathering against him. Those forces, led by Deng Xiapeng usurped power from his chosen Gang of Four after his death, but found it expedient to retain his personality cult, but not his policies.     One is left with a classic portrait of a petty tyrant, a thug, of little intellectual credibility who was spurred on by jealousies and egotism, to the great misery of those he claimed to champion. He really was a devil incarnate, with a legion of zombies at his beck and call.
0767803434|5.0|Air Force is the best film This action film, for me, should be rated as being a \\"Action Film\\". Harrison Ford once again plays the reluctant hero, and plays it very well.This is a great film if you want to sit back and be entertained without having to think too much.It will not set your world on fire but you will enjoy it,The picture quality is very good with a nice anamorphic transfer and very few marks on the print, This film may suffer from a slightly unbelievable story line but when you have Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman and Glenn Close delivering performances as strong as these, In this action packed blockbuster, Hollywood legend Harrison Ford stars as President Marshall on board the presidential plane Air Force 1. 1000's of feet in the air President Marshall is horrified when he discovers that the plane has been hijacked by communist radicals. Unless he meets the demands of Korshunov (radicals leader), everyone on board Airforce One will be executed. As well as having to save his own skin the President also faces the daunting prospect of having to rescue his wife and daughter from the jaws of death. <br />In a film which sees the President's daughter held at gunpoint and his plane chased by Russian fighter jets, Air Force One takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions. This thriller has more twists and turns than the River Nile and is bound to keep you on the edge of your seat right through to the closing credits. <br /> <br />As well as having an excellent plot that keeps both the mind and eye stimualted, the quality of the acting and special effects used make a major contribution to the film. Any movie which features a household name such as Harrison Ford usually guarantees acting of the highest quality and Air Force One is no exception. Ford maintains his reputation as being a top class yet versatile actor in a career that has seen his roles range from playing an outer space cowboy through to an adventurer in the deepest jungle. Although not in the same league asthe Indiana Jones or Starwars trilogy.
B00005JMXX|4.0|I really enjoyed this film and remeber seeing it when it came out in the theaters. Ok it's a disaster film so the acting is not the greatest get over it. The story is scary and farfetched but edge of your seat end of the world exciting. The special effects are outstanding and the directing is great. A must see popcorn film.
B00005JMCT|3.0|What to say about this film... well I did had suspicions that this would be a rehash and unfortunately my suspicions have been confirmed. <br />The original concept has already been and gone, perhaps the makers should have stopped at American Pie and not gone on to do a second film let alone a third! <br /> <br />The idea behind this film is a little different to the others at least, but as the film goes on, the typical gross-out moments, fatherly advice and pratical jokes creep in and it's back to the old formula! I suppose as the old saying goes... If ain't broke, don't fix it huh? <br /> <br />Also, what happened to OZ and the Sherminator? They were classic characters, seeing as it was a wedding shouldn't have all the characters from the previous two films been in it and got together (Nadia for example?) as a sort of a fair well / good luck tribute to Jim & Michelle? Or is it (as I suspect) that a fourth PIE film is in the pipeline? hmmm... <br /> <br />But there aren't all bad moments, the classic personality swap of Stifler and Finch made me laugh the most, just imagine the Finchmeister and Stifler being polite and proper, and of course... the stag party, that's not to be missed!!!  <br /> <br />This film would be good as a rental DVD to watch with friends & family but unless you are a hardcore PIE fan, I wouldn't recommend buying it as the humour is something of an aqquired taste! The extras on the DVD are good and are of typical PIE fair, music videos, featurettes etc, the outakes are very good!  <br />
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Amazing, Wondefull and exciting a great film. I would have to say this film should go down as the most insperational film and at time some wat real amkes you think films of all time. When the film is down you will think about the governments and how they run the world. The film is amazing the story is great from beggin to end, it will have you on the edge of your seat. The acting is great and the directing is outstanding. I must see. One of the best films of 2006.
B000031WD9|5.0|Basically, to start off with if you are a fan of ludicrous and hilarious comedies like Scary Movie and South Park you are gonna absolutely love American Pie. <br />I sat back in an armchair the first time I watched this. I'd got my parents to rent it from a video store for me and the only reason I'd chosen it was because it sounded funny. However, Funny is not the word to describe this movie. This is absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br />Opening up with a party at the sex crazy Stifler's house we are introduced to Jim, Finch, Ozz and Kevin. Four teenage virgins waiting to get lucky and intending to before prom night which, unfortunately, happens to be three weeks away. <br /> <br />They are gobsmacked when Sherman, a dweeby ginger kid says he got laid at that very party whilst they were just drinking beer downstairs.So now the group make a pact to help each other get laid before prom night or at prom night. <br /> <br />What ensues is a lineup of the most hilarious scenes possible. Jim broadcasts Chekslovakian Nadia on the internet and when it comes to him getting it on with her he comes in his pants, twice!!!, Kevin tries to restore his relationship with his girlfriend and Finch gets a reputation which seems to give him the advantage. <br /> <br />With Stifler constantly in their faces for them being virgins you'll love the hilarious situations the group get themselves into and you'll love the people they encounter. <br /> <br />Hint: \\"What's my name b****?\\"
B0001WTVUW|3.0|I enjoy disaster films and this one I herd about and had to watch it and I enjoyed it. Ok it was made in the 80's so it's not the greatest acting and the special effects are not the greatest but get over it. Also the film is made for tv so it's disterbing but not too disterbing. The film is about what if the cold war really happend and the nuc where droped in the us. It falls the vents and shows us what would happend if it really did and how to rebuild civilization. The acting is ok the story is edge of your seat( if you canr get past the first hour which was pretty bad).

0140187537|4.0|This Steinbeck novel mesmerized me when I was young; it was my favorite \\"morality\\" book. But now that I'm older and I've read it again, I'm not so sure where it stands. I loved its cerebral but playful style, similar to Steinbeck's East of Eden, and I took as gospel the book's revelations about the ethics and reality of business. The story takes place in a small New England town, but it's meant to apply to the world at large.<br /><br />On a second \\"older\\" reading, I feel that I have discovered why this book is an \\"overlooked\\" classic, which makes me wonder how Steinbeck's acknowledged powerhouses - Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden - would fare on a second reading. The Winter Of Our Discontent is still cerebral and playful, it's still a good story, but now it seems too clever by half. It's almost as if Steinbeck tried to put The Great Game into a small town and it doesn't quite fit. The characters are clever and witty, but none of them, not even the main character, Ethan, is truly fleshed out. The characters seem to represent ideas rather than people, or they exist merely to advance the plot. People are divided into two camps: those in the know and playing the game and those not. Ethan is an exception; he is a good man who is aware of the game but stays out of it and protects his family from it. But the price Ethan pays for goodness is to be meek and almost poor. Once Ethan begins to feel pressure from his family to rise up from his ethical but lowly station in life, he decides to get in the game, and he plays like a master. Ethan doesn't overrationalize his decision, but he is quietly desperate, making it feel a bit false and overplayed to me, especially at the conclusion when Ethan's ambivalence overwhelms him (I can't say more about this without giving an important part of the story away). In other words, The Winter Of Our Discontent seems like an oversimplistic moral story with undeveloped characters. It wasn't as \\"deep\\" as I remembered. I wasn't able to know or like any of the characters; I could only follow the plot, which, as I said, is still interesting enough.<br /><br />Now I have the challenge of finding a new favorite morality story, one that is deep, true, compelling, and a great read. No, don't tell me about Ayn Rand! Any other suggestions?or like any of the characters; I could only follow the plot, which, as I said, is still interesting enough. <br /> <br />Now I have the challenge of finding a new favorite morality story, one that is deep, true, compelling, and a great read.

B000EHRVP6|2.0|Tarantino is a favorite filmmaker of mine. Eli Roth unfortunately is not. Yes Cabin Fever was entertaining but this film never really gets to the point. Porno flick disguised as horror movie.
B00005J9U1|4.0|Good, (well all Bob Marley is good) but I still have that feeling from what I got 5 years ago when it was released that they left out some very important songs, yes I am delighted that they have put \\"So Much Trouble In The World\\" on it as it is a flawless song, but reasons why they have left out \\"Satisfy My Soul\\" and the oringinal \\"Redemption Song\\", still leave me saying why. <br />I do like how they have put it in year order, and have included a song off each album, apart from Babylon By Bus, well they just had to put on \\"No Woman No Cry\\" of Live, so I will let them off. <br />\\"Roots Rock Reggae\\", is another great song deserving a place on this album, but maybe \\"War\\" or \\"Positive Vibration\\" to replace that, or to add on to it. <br />\\"Coming In From The Cold\\" deserves every right to be on Legend and this, it is just an amazing song and has had not enough credit for it. <br />Otherwise that, it is a strong album, and worth the money. <br />A good purchase.
0553588486|3.0|I'm nearly through this first book and can say that I will be picking up the next installment, however I fail to see how so many people that have posted positive reviews can even begin to compare Martin's series with classics such as LOTR.  Not to say that this book is bad, it is in fact quite good; well-paced, lots of interesting characters who will inevitably have something horrible happen to them, complex plots and just enough of a supernatural flavor to appeal to the fantasy/sci-fi readers.  Why I have chosen to give this book a mere 3 stars is because while the book is good, it is not great.  At times, I found the language and sentence structure to be stifling and annoying, but still bearable.  Also, some of the things described in the book are rather gross and I would say it is truly written for adults and not children.  However, one of the greatest liberties we are still able to enjoy in this country is the freedom to purchase books without proving we are of \\"legal age\\" to read the material.  So, for those reviewers who complain about how dirty these books are, I would beg them to remember that to slap a rating on a book, even this one, would be a further erosion of our rapidly disappearing freedoms, so stop it already and let people make their own choices.  But, I digress...back to the book; it is kind of pulpy and is very good summer reading, but not particularly memorable.  I typically do not buy paperbacks, but would not spend any more than a few bucks for each of these books; I just don't think they're worth it.  I would recommend this book for grownups who can keep track of a lot of different plots and characters and are not turned off by lurid descriptions of sex and violence.  This is also a great book for readers of regular fiction/mystery/history to try out a little fantasy that isn't cartoony or goofy, but more realistic.  For younger readers, Tad William's To Green Angel Tower would be my recommendation of a good epic with nowhere near the amount of graphic language contained in this book.of graphic language contained in this book.

0735105855|3.0|This hardcover version of this famous novel is reasonably good except that the binding seems to come apart at around page 115 although the font size of the words seems to be just right for comfortable reading.<br /><br />Now to the novel itself: we get a retired Hercule Poirot agreeing to distract himself from his new hobby of gardening to try and find out who killed a well-known and respected gentlemen, Mr. Roger Ackroyd.  The novel is typical Christie but is not the best one that she's written.  For that you'd have to read &#34;And Then There Were None.&#34;  Even &#34;Murder on the Orient Express&#34;, &#34;Death on the Nile&#34; and &#34;By the Pricking of My Thumbs&#34; are much, much better overall works but this novel's claim to fame is really the unexpected and previously unused formula for the ending.  Otherwise, the rest of the novel is pretty boring as every evidence seems to point to an obvious culprit who, thanks to the brilliant Poirot, is exonerated.  If you are a fan of the detective, whodunnit genre, then read this as essential reading for the genre but just know that Agatha Christie has written better novels and if you decide to never ever read another Christie novel, you must at least read &#34;And Then There Were None&#34; or any of the others listed above.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|(Note: SPOILERS!)<br /><br />So here I am, a lonely voice in the minority here, but I just didn't love this at all, and think it's sloppy, average, and kind of insulting, actually. I was so disappointed, because I really liked \\"Notting Hill,\\" and am a huge fan of \\"Blackadder.\\"<br /><br />The movie has some good points, and of course some absolutely fantastic actors and performances.  But half the storylines feel cliched, smug, and rushed, while the other half are either unutterably depressing, unbelievable, or just plain insulting.<br /><br />What I disliked the most was this really strong aura of sexism, and in kind of a nasty way (and I'm cringing to even write this, as I know it sounds oversensitive and all that).<br /><br />But really:  most of the men who are in love in this (Grant, Firth, the guy in love with Kiera Knightley, even the little boy) are in situations where they literally have yet to say 10 words to their dream girls. They just \\"love\\" from afar.  But that's not love, that's lust, dudes.<br /><br />And of course all the women who are adored are hotties (even down to the gorgeous miniature Mariah Carey the kid likes). Even Colin Firth's maid has to strip down to her undies, in a totally contrived scene, so that we can see that even this unlikely person actually has the body of a swimsuit model. (And that doesn't even count the idiot who goes to Wisconsin and promptly gets invited into a foursome by some idiotic but gorgeous (of course) model-type American girls. I kept waiting for this part to be a dream -- it's that jarring -- and was shocked it was actually supposed to be believable.)<br /><br />And hey, everyone likes pretty people on film so no problem normally -- but when so many of the women seem to be subservient to the men -- the maid, the PM assistant, two secretaries, lumped in with some dumb-as-dirt US bimbos -- a pattern does kind of emerge. (Ever notice how almost ALL of Curtis's \\"romantic\\" storylines -- even in his other movies -- are about men who are in \\"love\\" with a woman they barely know?)<br /><br />Add to this the constant fat jokes and the movie has a weird slimy undertone to it. Especially when most of these jokes are directed at a beautiful girl, the object of Grant's crush, who is just simply not fat at all. She's probably at worst a size 8.  How does that make his attraction \\"brave\\" or unique as it is evidently supposed to be? Even her coworkers are cruelly cavalier about this (invisible) weight problem (and yes there's more name-calling), and when Grant visits her at home, what do we see but that the girl's father, too, calls her rude fat-girl nicknames.<br /><br />I would get it, I guess, if she was actually fat, even in movie terms (like the chubby and still adorable Bridget Jones).  But she's not.  And then the movie has to end with yet another slew of really cruel fat jokes yet again, this time at a character's very heavyset sister.<br /><br />I guess my point is, where is the love?  What's so \\"love\\"ly about a bunch of guys lusting from afar, two desperately unhappy women, a little boy who is striving for the school hottie (to the extent that he -- AND Dad -- show no sign of missing his just-deceased mother at all).... etc.? Ironically only the porn stand-ins have actual conversations (and I actually thought their storyline was charming, if completely unbelievable -- same with Firth's - as well).<br /><br />But on the flip side, Laura Linney's story is incredibly depressing and unrealistic to boot. In real life, there is simply no way this woman could not have (1) a normal romantic relationship, or (2) that a truly nice or deserving guy, as her crush is supposed to be, would not understand her need to take a phone call, or to cut short a date (if it is actually \\"love,\\" shouldn't he be more understanding?).  But instead this guy cannot even wait 5 minutes for her to finish a phone call to her ill brother -- she has to be doomed, dramatically, to an unhappy ending that is completelyunbelievable (and a real downer of a message too).<br /><br />If you look at all of the stories, the only one that is actually about love is the one about the aging rock star's realization that his most loved friend is his long-suffering manager. Most of the other stories were superficial to the point of caricature, and those that weren't, and that ironically actually featured interesting women, like the wonderful Laura Linney or Emma Thompson (both fantastic with the limited stuff they are given to work with) -- were treated to cruel and really depressing outcomes.<br /><br />Even Alan Rickman's unpleasant and unworthy storyline is yet again simply about lust, for his transparently eeevil secretary. If this subplot had to happen, I would have been a lot more intrigued if instead we showed this man torn by real feelings for another woman -- not just \\"oh I'm in lust\\".  (But nothing in the movie is that deep, so oh well.)<br /><br />Again, all this would be fine except for the title. How is this the \\"love, actually\\" -- the love that's all around?  All I see is a bunch of talented Englishmen embarrassing themselves over women they think are hot stuff, but that's it.<br /><br />About the bookends with the airport (and monologue about 9-11) -- I don't mind the reference to 9-11 as some here do (I will always be touched by that memory of the English playing our national anthem the next day, in tribute), but I do think it has to be earned. And Curtis didn't earn it.  He didn't write a movie about love being \\"all around.\\" He wrote a sloppy, muddled and occasionally semi-funny movie about a bunch of highly professional men who spend much of their time gazing and drooling adolescently from afar.  The families in the airports are deeper, more touching, more real, than any of Curtis's silliness (and that's unfortunate).<br /><br />Anyway. It's cute on the surface. Fluffy and harmless, lots of pretty people, ancient pop tunes, happy-happy-joy-joy (and I know some of you are already pressing that \\"don't recommend\\" button on this review, mentally telling me to \\"shut up, it's just a movie\\" - LOL).

1568497369|5.0|This is a very well bound hardcover book that's built to last.  The fonts are also small but comfortable enough to read.<br /><br />As for the novel itself, coming from someone who has read too many Christie novels to remember, this is by far the best one that I've read.  The plot is brilliant and the perfect crime is committed so that the ending is truly unexpected and surprising.  In that sense, this novel is similar to \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" with regards an unexpected ending but that's where the similarity ends.  Whereas in that novel, the rest of the story is pretty pedantic and boring, this novel in contrast is exciting from beginning to end.<br /><br />The tension and suspense builds as you go along and the climax is nothing short of inspired writing.  If you are looking for Christie's best work, this has surely got to be among the top 3 if not the best she's ever done.<br /><br />Highly recommended reading!
0226264211|4.0|An all-time favorite of mine, Capitalism & Freedom creates a framework of classic liberalism and argues forcefully in favor of free-markets and decentralization over the expansion of government involvement in economic and social affairs.  Friedman builds his argument from the ground up by identifying coercion as the State's distinguishing feature over all other societal organizations.  From the (classic) liberal's perspective, this aspect shapes the relationship between citizen and government, and strictly limits the appropriateness of State involvement in society, particularly with regard to well-intentioned programs and policy.<br /><br />Friedman uses this foundation to build a case for limited government in economic matters, citing in particular the consequences of monetary and fiscal policy abuse.  In an exceptionally apt comparison, Friedman argues that the same rationale that limits government interference with free speech should likewise apply to government interference in the economy: namely, that constraints be applied to monetary and fiscal policy to limit the potential for government to do harm in its pursuit of doing good.  Friedman gives numerous examples in which government officials, exercising carte-blanche economic authority, have further aggravated economic crises by applying a case-by-case standardh to different economic scenarios.<br /><br />Having clearly laid out his political philosophy, Friedman builds his case for free-markets, detailing control measures intrinsic of a laissez-faire economy.  From floating exchange rates to voucher-funded schooling, union contracts to charity, Friedman argues that the free-market harnesses the productive potential of millions of individuals and corporations, reconciling their preferences in a competitive process far more efficiently than any collective body.  Throughout the book, Friedman debunks popular myths, disputes misunderstandings, and challenges the conventional wisdom prevalent among intellectuals and social elites of his day and ours.<br /><br />The book's only drawback is its age and somewhat antiquated writing style that would certainly make it difficult for some readers to fully understand (particularly those who are victims of public school \\"education\\").  Friedman references several examples that would have been more easily recognized in the 1960s, but will not be immediately familiar to younger readers.  Still, this brilliant work presents the core principles of laissez-faire capitalism and classic liberalism in a relatively clear manner, and is a must-read for anyone studying the dynamics of free-markets and free societies.ites of his day and ours.

B000EXZI0A|5.0|Ramones are my favorite band ever i would have to say, hence the 5 stars.... but since I have virtually their entire collection, The two best of compilations to get I would have to say are \\"Loud, Fast Ramones\\" or \\"Ramones Mania\\". Basically if you have those two compilation and their first self titled album, you can consider yourself set for a while. Ramones \\"Anthology is also awesome. My two favorite Ramones albums of all time are RAMONES \\"Ramones\\" and \\"Mondo Bizarro\\", Of course I'm talking about getting a quick RAMONES fix here, or if you just wanna check out the band for the first time... you gotta start somewhere right? well i wouldn't start here, I would strongly suggest, for the price and a good starting place either \\"Loud, Fast\\" or \\"Mania\\", the two-disc \\"Anthology\\" is pretty damn good as well... But c'mon ,How bout a rarities disc already or something???
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I know a lot of people are saying that this cd is bad and that AFI are sell-outs, but in my opinion this is one of the best cds I own and i've been listening to it since i bought it two weeks ago. For all you people that say these bands suck if they change their look or their style of music should just get over it, people change, music changes- it's gonna happen sooner or later. And for you people that were probably disappointed upon first listen and just threw it in the bottom of your cd pile, listen to it a few more times. I even had to listen to it a couple times before it fully stuck with me. even though this is my first AFI album I love the music and I think the vocals are great.  <br /> So buy it, listen to it a few times, and appreciate the hard work put into it.
0064407667|5.0|If you're looking for a good book to read, or a new and original series to begin - this is it!  \\"The Bad Beginning\\" is the first book in the \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" book series.  This book is not your average book, and Lemony Snicket is not your average writer. In \\"The Bad Beginning,\\" the three happy Baudelaire children (Violet, Klaus, and Sunny) become the three sad Baudelaire orphans when they receive the news that they're parents had died in a terrible fire! Now, the children -along with an enormous fortune left behind by their parents, that they will posses once Violet (the eldest) comes of age- must go to live with their 'never heard-of' relative: Count Olaf. But, there's more to the actor and uncle, Count Olaf, than meets the eye. Could it be that Count Olaf simply wants to murder the children to earn their money, since he is their new legal guardian? Or could he just be a very nice man who treats the children really, really, really bad for no reason? A true must-read for all ages, Mr. Snicket is a very clever author who uses the element of suspense very good. If you want to know if the children escape Count Olaf's clutches and what will become of them, then you must read this! Plus, like any other \\"I want your money\\" story - there's a wedding at the end. But guess who's getting married to who?!
B000F48CD8|2.0|Hate to throw a damper on the lovefest of reviews here, but  nothing here is much above the paucid state of rock music in 2006. The cd starts off promising, but falters a couple of tracks in. (I can already hear the shrieks of horror from rabid Jack White fans.)     The first time I heard the song \\"Steady as She Goes\\" on the radio, I thought it was a remake.  As others have noted elsewhere, the bassline/hook/rhythm  to \\"Steady as She Goes\\" is lifted nearly note-for-note intact from Joe Jackson's song \\"Is She Really Going Out with Him\\".  Rather ironic that the normally bass-phobic Jack White would find inspiration there.  I find it hard to imagine that anyone could call the song original other than the under 25 club that find the White Stripes original.    Calling the Raconteurs a 'Supergroup' strains the definition.  This is more fairly described as a side project.  'Supergroup' used to be reserved for projects where each member was the key member of groups (or an artist) that were all 'household' names.  Jack White is well known, but face it, the rest are unknowns.  (I'd bet if you stopped 1000 people on the street, not one in that thousand would know anyone in this project other than Jack White.  And probably only ten would know him...)
B0002234LS|2.0|These types of movies are becoming quite the trend in Hollywood. Fight Club started it (which was an awesome movie). Then the Sixth Sense (which was also pretty good). After that, it all went downhill. The Brown Bunny, The Machinist, The Others, Hide & Seek, etc. Surprise endings with a twist, characters that don't exist that are only in the main characters imagination, daed characters that don't know they are dead. These movies are all about surprising the audience with the already overused plot twists. I predicted that John Torturro's character was a figment of Depp's imagination within the first 20-25 mins of the film. Why would an actor of Depp's status take part in a movie of this substance?

This one actually works in the feilds it works in. The reason it is rated PG (well I think its rating today would be PG-13) is because the creators fought with the MPAA to get it. All in all a graet film.
B000BEZPQE|5.0|I'll get right to the point: I have rarely enjoyed a live album as much as this one since Pantera's \\"Official Live: 101 Proof\\" was released in 1997. I had seen Slipknot on tour prior to hearing \\"9.0 Live\\", and I was very impressed with their live show, but I had no idea this album would be just as good as being in the stadium with the band. But it is! Live albums sometimes have trouble capturing the great energy and sound quality of the band's live show, but that sure isn't a problem here. In fact, \\"9.0 Live\\" almost indisputably sounds fuller, heavier, darker, tighter, and louder than most of Slipknot's live albums (especially compared to their latest studio offering, 2004's \\"Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses\\"). These two discs are literally jam packed with superb, ferocious excitement. This album's building energy is so present, its almost tangible.<br /><br />Furthermore, if you've ever had your doubts about Slipknot being good musicians and/or songwriters, you can now (and forever) lay those doubts to rest. The guitarists, Mick Thompson and James Root, thrash away at their instruments, playing riff after blazing riff, and drummer Joey Jordinson, who might be the most talented one in the group, plays very talented, almost punk-ish drum beats which drive the songs. Plus, one might think that having all nine band members playing at the same time would drown out somebody's playing, but it almost never does. Even the second drummer, Chris Fehn, gets his moment in the spotlight (as in \\"The Blister Exists\\" and \\"Before I Forget\\").<br /><br />The only foreseeable downside to \\"9.0 Live\\" is that some fans may not be able to sit through the whole thing (it is two discs and darn close to being two hours long). But, to be fair, there is a fair share of banter between frontman Corey Taylor and the crowd. Plus, drummer Joey Jordinson does get one whole track to himself (track eleven on the first disc, \\"Drum Solo\\" is an interlude of sorts.)<br /><br />Every single song on here is executed and performed absolutely perfectly. Some of the songs are even arguably better than the studio version. The first disc begins with a joking, British-sounding voice telling the audience (much to their dismay) \\"Slipknot will not be performing this evening.\\" Guitarist Mick, however, then launches into a grinding main riff and the first song, \\"The Blister Exists\\", has begun. This is one of many inspiring songs here which is pulsating with intensity and exhilaration (other songs like this include \\"(sic)\\", \\"Disasterpiece\\", and \\"Eeyore.\\") The catchy songs (\\"Before I Forget\\", which features both guitarists pounding out churning, headbanging riffs, and the careening \\"Pulse Of The Maggots\\") remain catchy, and maybe even have slightly better hooks than the originals. Some other places on the first disc, like during track six (when Corey bellows \\"It's time for everyone to jump, come on!\\"), I could barely control myself from staying in my seat. That song also establishes a good dynamic, because Slipknot played a neck snapper like \\"Liberate\\", but then take things down a notch for a more restrained number, \\"Vermillion.\\" Later on, \\"Purity\\" (which is actually a rarity which evolved from a Slipknot demo), allows the DJ (Sid Wilson) to shine, because it begins with some good, catchy scratches. \\"Eyeless\\" shows off the whole band's stellar musicianship and willingness to work as a whole. This song is very musically complex, as it begins with some more DJ scratching and boasts a terrific give-and-take between the double bass drumming and scorching riffs.<br /><br />Next, for track eleven, Joey turns out a lengthy, multi-speed, polyrhythmic, everything-but-the kitchen-sink drum solo which is pretty darn amazing.<br /><br />\\"The Heretic Anthem\\"--which begins with a chilling spoken word intro (of the song's chorus) before turning to heavy, churning riffs and swift, buzzsaw drumming--and an especially vicious rendition of \\"People=Sh - t\\" are the two main highlights on the second disc.But they aren't the only standouts: \\"Three Nil\\", \\"Everything Ends\\", and \\"Duality\\" are a couple of the other blistering tracks. Plus, \\"The Nameless\\", which has a great friction between the hard hitting guitars and two acoustic breakdowns, and the punching guitars and emotional, throat-straining yells on \\"Skin Ticket\\" (which is actually pulled off, here, quite well for a song Slipknot had never played in concert before), are notable, as well. And the very last song is \\"the international f - ckin' anthem\\" (which is what Corey calls \\"Surfacing\\").<br /><br />One might think that, over the course of these twenty-four tracks, the novelty might wear off. But that isn't true, either! Simply put, \\"9.0 Live\\" is a fantastic live album from an absolutely great live band (and great band in general). Definitely buy this album if you're a Slipknot fan, pop it in your changer, and (as Corey says early on) be \\"ready to have a f - ckin' good time\\"!ee Nil\\", \\"Everything Ends\\", and \\"Duality\\" are a couple of the other blistering tracks.

B000002KZA|5.0|En 1983, Depeche Mode volvio a ser un cuarteto; con la incorporacion de Alan Wilder no solo como tecladista sino como un gran arreglador y vital en el lapso que seguiria hasta 1995. Comienzan a experimentar nuevas cosas, como sampleos (que era algo muy poco usual para la epoca) y tambien una evolucion importante en las letras de Martin Gore, basadas en la teoria marxista; cuyo resultado es el disco \\"Construction time again\\" de 1983.    El disco parte con dos temas muy comunes; \\"Love in itself\\", una excelente anti-cancion de amor y \\"More than a party\\", que es una semejanza (en mi punto de vista) contra la droga. Lo novedoso es que se incorpora nuevos sonidos que nunca se habian escuchado en los dos discos anteriores; para lo que el album se espera mas; y es asi, sorprendiendo con \\"Pipeline\\" una cancion para el obrero trabajador; cuyos sonidos son minimalistas, sonidos de cañerias, por ejemplo. Luego, para terminar la primera parte, esta el clasico \\"Everything counts\\" una cancion que hasta el dia de hoy se mantiene en el repertorio clasico del grupo.    La segunda parte del disco comienza con una cancion compuesta por Alan Wilder: \\"Two minute warning\\" que habla sobre la energia nuclear. Luego \\"Shame\\", una cancion critica contra los mandamases de la epoca por los niños desnutridos en Africa; \\"The landscape is changing\\", otro tema de Wilder, en el cual habla sobre como los paisajes se convierten en edificios, centrales hidroelectricas, etc. \\"Told you so\\", un tema que podria haber sido tercer sencillo de este disco, con una vision ironica del mundo por parte de Martin Gore; y al final \\"And then...\\", cuya tematica es el futuro mundial a modo de Depeche Mode.    Tal vez para la gente que no esten de acuerdo con la politica izquierda y marxista o la politica en general, no le gustaran este disco. En mi opinion, creo que es uno de los clasicos perdidos; me parece que es uno de los mejores discos de DM, pero al mismo tiempo, no esta a la altura de \\"Some great reward\\", \\"Black celebration\\", \\"Music for the masses\\", \\"Violator\\" y el mismisimo \\"Playing the angel\\". Musicalmente mostraban una evolucion que perduro en los siguientes discos, innovando mas sonidos.
B00005JOWF|2.0|OK, two stars. Sorry about that if you like this film, but I cannot tell you a lie. Before you dislike my review, let me tell you that I really loved Kurt Wimmer's first film as directo `Equilibrium' and its gun-kata actions. \\"Silly\\" some say. Or \\"Childish.\\" Yes, I know, but I also know that it's great fun. And Christian Bale's gun actions are sensational.  <br /> <br />But I should be talking about 'Ultraviolet.' Well, `Ultraviolet' starts promisingly. Shot with Sony's high definition camera, the digital touch of the opening sequences perfectly matches the futuristic city and its apocalyptic story about the battle between the two kinds of humans. The first 20 minutes are very good with gadgets and fighting, Sure, many of them look rather ridiculous like gravity-defying motorcycle, but I like the idea precisely because it is ridiculous. And the opening title sequences with the clever use of comic book are brilliant.  <br /> <br />Then after the secrets about the `secret weapon' are revealed, the film suddenly loses its power. Occasionally the film shows actions, but they at best are mildly interesting. The reason is simple: weakly written characters and inept editing that killed any momentum of the gun/martial actions. The action choreography needs more stylish touch, or at least some originality.  <br /> <br />Now, let me give you advice. If you have not seen `Equilibrium,' go and get it. Then after watching it, compare it with `Ultraviolet.' You get similar dark, futuristic world, gun actions, and super-cool hero/heroine, but which is really cool? Which editing is superior? And most importantly, which action is more exciting to see? I give you a hint: Christian Bale.  <br /> <br />Yes, 'Equilibrium' stars Christian Bale who as you know went on to become the Batman. Christopher Nolan's `Batman Begins' proves one thing and that is, to make a good action film, you need an actor who can act, or infuse life into the character s/he plays. `Ultraviolet' has Milla Jovovich who was terrific elsewhere (like Leeloo in `The Fifth Element'), but here she is far from her best. Her character in the Besson film was never boring a single moment while her Violet and her emoting sound completely hollow in `Ultraviolet.'  <br /> <br />Kurt Wimmer's `Ultraviolet' is a huge disappointment after watching his much better work `Equilibrium.' Familiar phrase is `Rent before you buy it\\" but in this case perhaps you should rent his debut film before this one. Not perfect fiasco, but still letdown.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Kingdom of Heaven is a drastically under-rated film. Perhaps, politically, it came out at a bad time. Perhaps the American people (yes, I am American, but the USA is where this film seemingly did the worst) just don't care all that much about history not directly related to the United States. Who knows. But this film is simply fantastic. The scenery is gorgeous, and the entire film is incredibly well-acted. In my mind, Jeremy Irons truly stole the show, as he always tends to. <br /> <br />Historical inaccuracies are certainly present, but to a much lesser degree than in many other films that shall not be named. My only major gripes were threefold: <br />1.) The rather silliness of a practically untrained man suddenly becoming a knight of renown, defeating foes left and right and having a functional knowledge of military strategy without explanation. <br />2.) The Hollywood obsession with fire. I am so sick of every movie having balls of flame shooting through the air. It's ridiculous, ahistorical, and just. . . annoying. Jerusalem was not attacked with balls of fire. To make it so is painfully absurd. <br />3.) The entire Siege of Jerusalem. Definitely one of the best sieges in a film. Also totally Hollywood in many ways -- enough that it irks me every time I watch it. There's no way Saladin, logistically, could have attacked Jerusalem with that many trebuchets. It's simply not possible to haul them around pre-built, and building them takes time and materials. NOT ignoring simple logistic concerns like this, to my mind, would have made the film much better. (As a sidenote, horses in war do not charge for a half-mile at full gallop.) <br /> <br /> <br />However, overall the film was truly amazing to see, engaging, and hey - I loved it. I'd also like to take a moment to address some rather ludicrous statements by a previous reviewer who seems to accuse Ridley Scott of an anti-Catholic bias while simultaneously displaying a pro-Catholic bias in his assessment. <br /> <br /> <br />1.) The Christians in Kingdom of Heaven did not watch Muslim prayer \\"in awe of their amazing spirituality.\\" Anyone paying attention can clearly see they are simply curious. This has historical precedent. The Christians -were- curious about the religious habits of the Muslims; finding them at once strange and familiar. <br /> <br />2.) The Catholic faith is not displayed as either brutish or ignorant. Prominent Catholics in the film, such as King Baldwin and Jeremy Irons are peace-loving, true men. As another reviewer pointed out - the film is told from a Christian perspective and so shows, quite well, the conflict between Christians. It shows those who were quite good, and those who were quite bad. This is historical fact. Ridley would have had to be out of his mind to ignore it. <br /> <br />3.) \\"God Wills It\\" (which I will point out contains no apostrophe) was a common phrase of the time to instigate battle. The Christians believed they were doing God's will. So 'God wills it' is obviously not incorrect. They would say that whenever preparing a movement against Muslims. And yes, historically they did use it as somewhat of an excuse to do great acts of evil. And the Muslims did the exact same thing, with pretty much the exact same catch phrase. <br /> <br />4.) Priests were not all good people. They -did- lie, cheat, and steal. One needs only crack open a history book, even one written by Christians, to find this out. Not all black people are gangbangers. Not all Christians are good people. To believe otherwise about either one is a vapid prejudice. <br /> <br />5.) Of course monks claim that goodness comes from defending those who cannot defend themselves. This has very little to do with Catholicism directly, and everything to do with the concept of Knighthood. Again - crack open a history book and one quickly finds that one of a knight's chief duties was the protection of the weak. <br /> <br />6.) And anyone who doesn't believe \\"Convert to Islam andRepent Later\\" was never said needs, again, to crack open a history book. Off-handedly, I can think of three historical figures during the Crusades who, when captured, converted to avoid disfigurement or death, and then repented when they were ransomed back. <br /> <br />To believe that portraying fact somehow casts a bad light on anything is absurd. Fact is fact. Bad people do bad things. Good people do good things. And sometimes good people do bad things. Hell, sometimes bad people do good things. That's history for you. But before making accusations of bias and prejudice, one should probably make an effort at learning the material, else one makes a fool of oneself. <br /> <br />As for Catholic traditions being largely ommitted. That's certainly true, and unfortunate. A bit more piety would have been nice to see in the film. Though the particular complaints are a bit silly. Godfrey not being sorry for one sin in his life shows that he is a good man - its cinematic. As is Baldwin's insistence that he will only confess to God; which I believe has some truth, historically -- but I don't feel like cracking open one of my biographies on him to check. <br /> <br />Even if it's not, however, show me proof that all Catholics observe every single doctrine of their faith. You can't. And it was no different 800 years ago. <br /> <br />(And yes, Saladin was a rather tolerant man, as remarked by people who actually knew him in life -- Crusaders who knew him in life, that is. Again - reading books is good for one's mind.) <br /> <br />All in all, fantastic movie that should absolutely not be dismissed as some Christian slam-fest by an Islam-favouring Hollywood director. Ridley may give slightly more reverence to the Islamic faith, but the reason for that is clear - current media portrays them all as psychotic terrorists - Ridley wanted to avoid that. Totally understandable, if not entirely historically accurate. <br /> <br />Still, I believe everyone with an interest at all in this subject matter should watch the movie, and read some books on the subject - and so decide for themselves whether the movie did or did not come close to any semblance of truth and 'rightness.' Enjoy it. And even if you don't find it accurate - enjoy it as a Hollywood film, because even if it weren't historical at all, it would still be a damned fine piece of cinema. <br /> <br />
B00005BKXU|1.0|My sister loves this film and has been driving me nuts playing it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. You get the idea. Even worse, she puts on the karaoke mode and sings along to every song. If you are buying this DVD for somebody you live with, don't. If you are buying it for the partner of your worst enemy, good choice.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a movie that haunts you, gets inside your soul and gnaws away, and generally just doesn't leave you.  Part of that mystery and experience is this gorgeous, haunting score and perfectly chosen soundtrack selections.  You hear the lean, spare score long after the movie is done.  It's as evocative of the rugged, basic world the movie's two main characters inhabit as their spare dialogue.
1878424319|5.0|though i don't share the faith of the author entirely, i think that this book presents some excellent insights into the ways in which we sabotage ourselves and offers solutions to how to increase our awareness in an effort to change our behavior. as a Christian reader, i found ruiz's sentiments useful and practical, even elegant in their simplicity--regardless of the faith he professes himself. how he got to his conclusions is not as important as how useful they are, in my opinion, so long as those conclusions fit with one's belief system.<br /><br />in using this text with patients, i have found that the most difficult agreement with which to comply is the one that suggests that we not take things personally. certainly, there are situations that feel very personal (e.g., discrimination); but what we have to remember is that those situations are presented to us because of an issue on the part of the presenter. that is, we are each subject to our own perceptions and interpretations of others and their actions. those perceptions become our reality--right or wrong--and we act in accordance with that reality. for instance, if i perceive that the world is a cruel and uncaring place, and i choose to be rude to the people in it, that has nothing to do with the people with whom i come into contact but rather with my own issues, created by my own perceptions. as another example...if i have a really bad day at work and come home and start lambasting my spouse because the kitchen sink is dirty, chances are my frustration is misdirected (analogous to \\"kicking the dog\\") and/or i have higher standards for cleanliness than my spouse. either way, it is dubious that the real issue is a dirty sink. in other words, my spouse would be best advised to not take my frustration personally. of course, this is easier said than done, but once you try it and see the benefit of not owning others' baggage, you will reap the reward of living a much happier life.<br /><br />the idea of not making assumptions is another powerful concept. we all know the phrase about what happens when you assume, but for many that phrase has become cliche and thereby gets ignored. phrases generally become cliche because there is a great deal of truth or power in them, but we seem to forget this more often than not. i work with couples on a daily basis who make assumptions about each other. they think that, because they have been together for some number of years, they know exactly what the other person is thinking. while it is true that we get to know our mates very well, we must not forget that we can never know exactly what s/he is thinking or feeling in every situation. this is especially true in conflict, when we are inclined to assume the worst because of the negative atmosphere that has been created.<br /><br />in terms of being impeccable with your word and always doing your best, there's more to this than meets the eye. i find these two agreements to be particularly useful for passive-aggressive and narcissistic personalities. with some degree of insight, these individuals can recognize that they are not truly living these agreements. for instance, a passive-aggressive person generally knows, on some level, that s/he is acting inappropriately if s/he genuinely looks into his/her heart of hearts. that being said, learning to live by the standards of impeccability and propriety can free the individual from a world of sabotage and hurt.<br /><br />some argue that the concepts are too simple, but i find that everyone can benefit from a reminder of even the simple things from time to time. maybe there should be a 5th agreement--the KISS principle--because keeping things simple is rarely a bad thing!

B000001YOW|5.0|This, PT's 1996 album \\"Signify\\" is 1 of the 2 PT CD's I own, the second one being 2005's \\"Deadwing\\". This album, I can hardly add much to what all of the other reviewers have said about this album. The sounds, the atmospheric feel to the album, everything just comes together to make this a brilliant mix of ethereal soundscapes, electronica, sound effects, and progressive rock. I will definitely be picking up more PT albums, namely 1995's \\"The Sky Moves Sideways\\", and 2002's \\"In Absentia\\". My favorite on this disc is Idiot Prayer, followed by Intermediate Jesus and Waiting Phase Two. If electronic sound effects, atmospheric synthesizers, and progressive music is your thing, then this is a must-have! 5 stars.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Months after it came out in the UK (where it topped the album charts), UK singer/songwriter Corinne Bailey Rae's eponymous CD finally gets released stateside with different cover art but the same track list.<br /><br />The CD is a throwback to 70s lush sunny soul music a-la Deniece Williams' hit 'Free'; lush strings, fleeting horns, organs, piano, and soothing harmonies, providing a beautiful background for her clear, feather-light vocals.<br /><br />The slightly upbeat, sunny breezy 'Put your records on' (with video to match, looking like a scene out of 'The sound of music') was denied the UK #1 spot by Madonna.<br /><br />My favourite is the opening track, the acoustic filled tender ballad 'Like a star' with ethereal backing vocals.<br /><br />'Enchantment' is just that, enchanting! Featuring a very relaxed delivery from Corinne, against a wall of lush strings and soothing harmonies. Fantastic bridge, by the way.<br /><br />Other stunning tracks are 'Trouble sleeping' (a UK top 40 hit), 'Till it happens to you' (with angelic backing vocals), and the tender piano driven 'Choux pastry heart'.<br /><br />Raising the tempo a bit are the disco tinged 'Call me when you get this', and the horn sprinkled Macy Gray channelling retro funk sound of 'I'd like to' with lyrics looking back to the past, and great percussion.<br /><br />The CD hit #1 in the UK. Here's hoping it does as well in the US. If you like this, try Amel Larrieux's brilliant new CD 'Morning'.

B000FBGBPC|5.0|Three years ago, a band made up of three punks from Canada decided to make a record which would release three singles and go platinum three different times.  Tons of threes aside, the Canadian sensation Three Days Grace, with a new member, have shoved their amazing debut album to the side and put together what they hoped would be the exception to the sophomore slump rule.  After all, when your first single ((I Hate) Everything About You) puts you on the map faster than anyone had expected, the expectations are high.  Luckily, all their fans can sleep soundly, the foursome has delivered. <br /> <br />The opening track, \\"It's All Over\\" opens in a strange bit of techoish beats, reminescent of the opener to the debut album \\"Burn\\".  Once the track kicks in though, you find yourself pulled in faster than you could have imagined.  The album's first single \\"Animal I Have Become\\" is a welcome assortment of riffs that will please fans of the first album, and the the stunning \\"Never Too Late\\" gives the CD a ballad that the first one was sorely missing.  Three Days Grace has also thrown in the typical rebellion songs such as the title track and \\"Riot,\\" both songs illustrating your typical rock attitudes. <br /> <br />Three Days Grace has again produced a solid album and have perhaps surpassed their outstanding first CD.  The songs are catchier than before, and lead vocalist Adam Gontier has clearly evolved as both a singer and song-writer.  Emotion tracks like the previously mentioned ballad and \\"Get Out Alive\\" show how much stronger the band has become with capturing feelings in their songs and the album greatly benefits from it.  This record feels sensational from start to finish and it's hard to imagine putting it away anytime soon.  Let's hope the boys from Three Days Grace can continue this production and have incredibly sensational careers. <br /> <br />Pros - Definite improvement in vocals and lyrics, great songs <br />Cons - Maybe just a bit short, a problem affecting the last CD as well <br /> <br />Grade ~ A (5 Stars) <br />A true gem in today's modern rock mines, an album of the year contender. <br /> <br />~The Gravity Pres
B000065V3H|5.0|one of my favorite movies of all time and definately the best teen movie of the 80s.  i am on bedrest for my pregnancy and this dvd (along with the veronica mars dvd and a book i just finished reading, both of which i just reviewed on amazon) has helped make the last few weeks bearable.  really brings back what it was like to be a teen in the late 80s and i can personally tell you that it stands up to repeated watching over and over again.  i must have watched this movie five times over the last few weeks and it never gets old. <br /> <br />love that ronny miller!!!
B000EMGAOY|4.0|It's been six long years since By The Way, the 2000 release of funk rock legends, the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  The album was criticized and many believed the Peppers had lost their touch.  Ready to put the rumors to rest, they have now released what may be the curtain call, the two-disc Stadium Arcadium.    The two discs, titled Jupiter and Mars don't have very different styles.  The two discs seem to primarily be a reason to shove more songs onto the album, unlike the double disc releases of bands like the Foo Fighters.  Luckily, the Chili Peppers can pull this off.  Stadium Arcadium's two discs contain memories of every cd, from Mother's Milk to Californication.  The first single \\"Dani California\\" is a song following the footsteps of \\"Parallel Universe\\" or \\"Give It Away\\" with it's '90's punk rock feel.  Other songs such as \\"Snow (Hey Oh)\\" and \\"Desecration Smile\\" slow down the tempo with calmer beats.    As always, Anthony Keidis' writing is standout on Stadium Arcadium.  Not only are his lyrics thought-indulging, but they're also unique.  This is evident simply by reading the track listing, including oddities like \\"Animal Bar\\" and \\"Storm In A Teacup.\\"  The masterful bass skills of Flea also have stayed perfectly in touch and the remaining band members play their supporting roles perfectly.  Every song feels blended together well and not sloppy at all.    However, Stadium Arcadium does have it's flaws.  The whole set is about half and half on mediocre songs and amazing ones.  While the first three songs of Jupiter are must-listen tracks, the title track is almost a must-avoid.  In reality, it seems the whole thing could have been condensed into one REALLY good album.  But alas, it's not that easy, and half of the time, you're stuck with less-than-amazing Chili Peppers tunes.    Pros - Lyrics and bass are choice as always, some amazing tracks  Cons - Feels like the whole thing could have been just one disc    Grade ~ B (4 Stars)  A solid effort, but you'll have to cut through some bad songs to find the real gems of this one.    ~The Gravity Press
B000BT97AO|4.0|I liked this movie. The imager is really amazing, the story is intersting to say the least. Even though some say the story is dull, I say its a tade bit slow at pace, but not dull at all. <br /> <br />I was also amazed that this is the director's first attempt at a movie, he is origially an illustrator and has worked with Niel for several years on graphic novels. <br /> <br />The movie will require you to have an open imagination and simply sit and enjoy. <br />If you give it a chance it will grow on you.
0385336691|5.0|This is my first Jack Reacher novel. It won't be the last. A tight and shifting story line. Excellent dialogue. Well drawn characters.

His reward for success - a million dollars. If he crosses the man - \\"I will put your eyes out.\\" he is promised. <br /> <br />What seems like a straightforward matter gets very complicated and the best way to find out the complications is to get the book and start reading. You will hate to put it down.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|I held off writing a review for this movie until I saw it a second time.  I am glad that I did.  I found myself enjoying it more the second time...<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />Zach Braff did a good job as the lead, but the supporting cast led by Steve Zahn and Joan Cusack stole the show.  But my favorite was Fish out of Water.  With no actual lines, he was the funniest by far.<br /><br />It is a typical Disney movie... funny characters, humorous plot with a message, etc.  So, if you like that kind of thing (or have a four year old who does), get this movie.  It is a good one for the collection.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />It is a typical Disney movie.  Slick, by the numbers, with not a lot of \\"soul.\\"  For some reason, the Pixar half of the creative machine that churns out computer animated movies always gets the \\"soul.\\" the Disney half, of which this is a product, sadly, doesn't.<br /><br />Everyone sure is exuberant in this movie, with lots of action, people screaming and really getting into things, but ultimately, you realize how empty it all seems in the end.<br /><br />I found it incredibly annoying that Disney chose to break the credits up with a message overlaid that says to stay tuned after the movie for extras that will automatically play.  I would prefer to watch the credits as they were supposed to be watched, and pick and choose which extras to view from the main menu.<br /><br />My completely unprofessional ratings:<br /><br />Direction:  3.0<br /><br />Voice Acting:  4.0<br /><br />Animation:  4.5<br /><br />Funny:  3.0<br /><br />Concept:  5.0 (it really is a neat concept)<br /><br />Total:  4.0 stars.  Hey, the animation is pretty cool.<br /><br />RANDOM THOUGHT OF THE DAY:  I think that it is a \\"Disney / Pixar thing\\" to have the characters in each movie walk through traffic and experience a \\"Walk/Don't Walk\\" sign or whatever passes for one in their world.  Look at how many times this bit has played out in animation in recent years:  \\"Monsters, Inc.\\", \\"Nemo\\", (Surely \\"Cars\\", which I have yet to see), \\"Chicken Little\\", etc.  Has anyone else noticed this?.\\", \\"Nemo\\", (Surely \\"Cars\\", which I have yet to see), \\"Chicken Little\\", etc.  Has anyone else noticed this?    <br />
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Whenever I watch  Jaws on TV, they always show the \\"deleted scenes\\" as part of the movie (I always crack-up at Quint singing along to the boy playing the clarinet, and at the additional footage of the crack-pots out on the motor boats with the rifles). Isn't there a DVD version that has the \\"deleted scenes\\" WITHIN the movie? Something is lost when they're viewed at the end of the film.

B00005JOX6|4.0|Im a huge Adam Sandler fan so i had to go see this one the day it came out. It wasnt the best movie but it was far from the worse. It had alot of humor but it also had alot of serious stuff. I would recomend this movie to anyone who loves Adam Sandler movies or to people that want to see a movie that has both serious and funny material. I wouldnt recomend taking your kids to this movie since their is some adult material.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|A disconcerting look to the movie, makes for some uncomfortable viewing. But scenes stay with you and in my dreams.. A mark of powerful filmmaking.
B000HT386M|4.0|Comedy and drama, it's a comedy-drama; and the screenplay is divided in an equal proportion of each. Adam Sandler's character wants a universal remote to make life \\"easier\\". What he doesn't expect, however, is that he'll receive a remote that does much more than control the VCR and the TV. It's a universal remote in the truest sense of the word universal; it controls the universe.<br /><br />The first half is hilarious. Sandler has a more mature style of humor in this one. It's not sniffing glue, seeing invisible Penguins, or making silly rhymes. It's slightly less capricious; although, there is still a little bit of fart humor.<br /><br />The second half...well, gets quite serious. As Sandler gets older, the remote starts to become intuitive. He no longer controls the remote; the remote begins to control him. Before he knows it, his life has changed and he has missed much more of his life than he wanted.<br /><br />Other interesting and/or enticing aspects of the movie make it quite enjoyable. Kate Beckinsdale's consistent beauty is worth the ticket alone. In every scene, regardless of attire of makeup, she looks absolutely stunning. The dog that has a sexuality issue causes several huge laughs with nearly the same joke every time. The daughter, when she grows up, is absolutely stunning, and will be a huge star in the very near future. I also enjoyed the appearance of the O'Doyle family, a family that first appeared on the Billy Madison movie. As with Billy Madison, the O'Doyle family experiences a little karmic justice (several times) that really makes the underdog role that Sandler portrays very enjoyable.<br /><br />The guy who is singing in the car will provide huge laughs. David Hasselhoff is strangely brilliant in the prick CEO role. The jogging chick is hypnotic. And Christopher Walken turns in his typically superb performance.<br /><br />The only negative to this movie is the insult of intelligence. For someone with a magic remote, an all-powerful remote, Sandler's character is blindingly ignorant and unimaginative. Anyone with half a brain and any sort of time to think would have been able to come up with much better usages for the remote than Sandler. A concept so vast was somewhat wasted on a static, linear thought process.norant and unimaginative.

B000F5GNX8|5.0|I wouldn't normally dish out 5 stars unless something was a classic or an Oscar winner in my opinion. Yet, the last few years have been dismal when it comes to making memorable, unique, quality films that will stand the test of time, and KISS KISS, BANG BANG was one of the most satisfying and entertaining films I've seen in a LONG LONG LONG TIME.<br /><br />Sharp. Crisp. Creative. Great screenplay. Unique. Different. Characters you can get behind and feel for. Personalities that capture your interest. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is a stylish, fast paced, in your face, suspensful, violent, funny, modern, slice of film noir.<br /><br />You can tell that SOMEBODY took their time with this one. Made sure they had a tight, solid and flawless script. Unlike most movies these days that are slopped together to beat deadlines, KISS KISS, BANG BANG made the rarely done these days decision to make sure they had it all covered before finishing.<br /><br />All that being said, the real quality of KISS KISS, BANG BANG comes from its stars... and I do mean STARS. Too many actors and actress are showing up these days who's only talent is being rich and related to someone who's good. It's nice to be reminded who the real stars are.<br /><br />Michelle Monaghan is a charming and shining delight throughout the film. From the moment she curled up to the detective novel she finds at a Hollywood party to going after the bad guys in her Santa Claus costume with gun in hand, she wins you over and proves she's gonna be a BIG BIG star.<br /><br />VAL KILMER is always an underrated talent and one of my favorites. He's been robbed of an Oscar twice (Tombstone & the Doors), and he's been shunned in some circles, but Val has always been unique and takes chances. No matter what movie he does, you never look at him as... \\"that's Val Kilmer\\", he becomes his characters, like Doc Holliday, like Jim Morrison & like the brash, not-a-nice-guy, gay Perry in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang.<br /><br />And Finally, Robert Downey Jr. Please Robert... keep making movies. Don't ever get sidetracked again, and don't ever forget how stickin' good you are. I don't know if his dialogue is scripted or if he is improvising from time to time, but Downey Jr. is ALWAYS in KISS KISS saying something witty, interesting or just making you think. He proves in this movie how good HE IS and ALWAYS has been.<br /><br />KISS KISS, BANG BANG is a fast moving creative minded joy and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies like I do.<br /><br />I only have one question???  So, seeing as though, this has very very few special features... a gag reel, that's it, when is the special edition DVD coming out? and is it pointless to buy this one now? Stinkin' greedy hollywood.

0780619951|3.0|No movie is going to be a direct representation of the novel on which it is based.  This doesn't include basic steps to modernize the film so that it makes a better connection with the viewer.  The basic Wells story is here with some modern upgrades, but some of the elements of this story are a little distracting. <br /> <br />Some of the actors were made for the role.  Marlon Brando was becoming more and more reclusive around the time of the film.  This quiriness fits the character of Doctor Moreau prefectly.  It is if he was made for the role.  Val Kilmer is a talented actor, but I am not sure he really fits this picture.  He does a fabulous Marlon Brando impersonation, but his quick role seemed more of a distraction to the film.  The other actors move the movie along, but none really stand out. <br /> <br />The movie is quick.  By the time we get into the film, it's over.  Having read the book, this didn't bother me too much.  I don't know if someone unfamiliar with the story would have been engaged enough to follow.  Also, the movie was so quick, that I really didn't see when the character of Mr. Douglas felt a connection with the beast-men.  This was a little distracting. <br /> <br />Taken as a whole, the movie was a good tale about humanity and our own inner animal.  Looking at this as a philosophical tale about humanity, I found it entertaining.

0679720200|5.0|Camus's much talked about opus was written in 1946 but is a story that defies the common restraints of datedness that hamper so many long-in-the-tooth novels from some of our greatest authors.  The story centers around a profoundly dissafected man living a quiet life in Algiers until one day he commits a pointless murder and the story reaches its climax after his trial.  Camus's prose is minimal and distant.  There is a palpable coldness that runs throughout.  Slowly the story and its alienated, emotionally blank narrator work their way deep beaneath your skin and the result is remarkably effective, chilling and unforgettable.  The Stranger is a timeless story of lonliness and disaffection and still rings true, perhaps even truer, today.  A treasure.  An absolute must.   READ THIS BOOK!
B00009UW0N|5.0|This movie started it all, and every slasher flick there after. There would be many halloween sequals. Really the only good sequal was halloween 2. The original halloween will always be the classic, I feel hallowen 2 was a bit more septic, cold and gory and fast paced, overall the halloween 2 soundtrack was better. Halloween will always be familiar with the public even if they have never seen the movie, they have heard of it. Carpenters soundtrack is a work of music genius (not just the main title). The movie has aged a bit the shock value has gone and it is a little campy. This movie will always be a work of cinematic enginuity and art. Carpenter and debra hill made the most of there $320,000 investment. Halloween  is enjoyable and keeps you going, you the viewer get  into the flick. I have seen it many times and will many more times. Anchor bay again as with (maniac 1980)has done an incredible job with the original film and soundtrack tranfer. Excellent high definition divimax viewing for your viewing pleasure. There most likely will be a 30th anniversary edition, but this 25th anniversary edition will be all you need. The extra bonus material dvd is a treat in itself for the horror movie fan or the film student. Enjoy the halloween 25th anniversary dvd divimax edition, it is worth the money to own. \\"The night he came home\\"
1565117808|5.0|EDIT AUGUST 4, 2011: Please forgive the lack of detailed analysis, as I wrote this review when I was young. ;-)    I have listened to \\"Life of Pi\\" on audio CD TEN TIMES! I absolutely LOVE THIS BOOK! It is by far, the GREATEST book I have ever read!!! Jeff Woodman, the narrator, made it ESPECIALLY more a spectacular read. Here's how I came to know about him. I had listened to the book a couple of times, and I figured that the narrator was an Indian. I looked him up. Turns out, HE'S AMERICAN!!! He is the best narrator I have ever had the pleasure of listening to, and I've listened to a LOT. I would recommend this book to EVERYONE! It is the most compelling, attention-grabbing, and awe-inspiring book on the planet!

B000FILW86|5.0|Everything positive that's said about this album is true. Sure, it's not CT's best album overall, but it DOESN'T by any means suck. It's uncommon for a band that's been around for years to make an album in this day and age that you can play from beginning to end without skipping songs. Every song on this album is a keeper.
B00005UKE0|4.0|George Harrison exited the Beatles with a backlog of songs he'd written but had not been able to record. Lennon and McCartney hogged most of the space on all of the Beatles' releases for their own songs. All Things Must Pass, Harrison's first major solo effort, is a solid pop/rock album with several classic tunes. The production, by Phil Spector, does seem slightly overblown, as Harrison himself notes in the CD booklet of this new Y2K remastered edition. But that was the style of the times -- the famed Wall of Sound.  <br /> <br />Many of the tracks on All Things Must Pass feature two drummers, several guitars (including an uncredited Eric Clapton), brass, woodwinds, keyboards by Gary Wright and Billy Preston, and orchestral arrangements. I like to think that this \\"superband\\" approach lends weight and impact to Harrison's songs, unlike Phil Spector's work on the Beatles' Let It Be album, which were excessive, with pointless orchestrations and choral arrangements.  <br /> <br />The remastered sound brings added clarity to what was a very dense mixture of voice, rhythm, and the twanging of many guitar strings. Still, the sound is not all that great, being positively overloaded to the point of distortion on louder songs like Wah-Wah and Let It Down.  <br /> <br />The original release featured two LPs plus a bonus LP record of studio jams. All of that material is represented in this remastered edition on 2 CDs, with additional demo recordings and a re-mix of My Sweet Lord. To quote another famous Harrison lyric, \\"It's all too much!\\"  <br /> <br />The studio jams are expendable, the demos interesting but not essential. (The quiet demo of the song All Things Must Pass found on the Beatles Anthology 3 collection is excellent, a valid alternative to the full-band treatment the song gets on this album, and I think it is unfortunate they did not include it.)  <br /> <br />George Harrison wasn't really a prolific songwriter. Good, but not prolific. He simply didn't have enoughexceptional songs to make All Things Must Pass a consistent double album. The main problem with this album is a lack of editing. <br /> <br />Disc One is where you'll find the big hits and the best material. Harrison begins with a song he co-wrote with Bob Dylan, the soft rock MOR romance I'd Have You Anytime.  <br /> <br />Next up is the superhit My Sweet Lord, which runs on repetitively like a mantra, successfully though. So does Isn't It A Pity, which reaches an orchestral and choral crescendo, repeating and repeating with variations like the outro to Hey Jude.  <br /> <br />Next comes What Is Life, a punchy pop tune with the memorable fuzz-box guitar phrase and classic slide guitar riffs. Slide guitar features prominently in the next song, Dylan's If Not For You, which turns the album toward a country music mood. Behind That Locked Door is a credible attempt by Harrison at a genuine country song.  <br /> <br />In the song Let It Down (\\"Let your hair hang down around me...\\"), the mood changes back to the sexy, slinky vibe of Harrison's hit song Something. The chorus of Let It Down is a little too agressive. It doesn't fit the tender feeling of the verse. Listen to the demo tape of Let It Down, also included on Disc One, and you'll see what I mean.  <br /> <br />Disc One highlights George Harrison's versatility as a songwriter. Disc Two is ecclectic, but more erratic in quality. It starts powerfully enough with Beware Of Darkness, but then quickly descends into whimsy with Apple Scruffs. I Dig Love (\\"I Dig Love... I Love Dig\\") is disappointingly silly. Then there's the preachiness of Awaiting On You All and trite religiosity of Art Of Dying and Hear Me Lord. Also disappointing is a second and more threadbare take on Isn't It A Pity. All Things Must Pass is pretty much the highlight of the second CD. Though listenable, the rest of the tunes are hardly top quality material. <br /> <br />In sum, All Things Must Pass is a fine album, but only a few of the songs reachthe level Harrison hit with the Beatles -- Taxman, Piggies, Here Comes The Sun, Something. Editing out some of the weaker material would have made for a tighter single-disc album. Four stars.  <br /> <br />I'm a great fan of Harrison's late-1970's work, namely his albums 33&1/3 and the self-titled George Harrison. Although the song subject matter is not as heavy on those releases, the recording and production is cleaner and tighter, and I felt the lyrics and music were more sophisticated. As good as Harrison was on All Things Must Pass, this was not his peak as a solo artist.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|So end of story, I'm pretty turned off by this genre of music in general.  I'm pretty much into r&b and pop (Its the genre of music I sing), but I love any music that hasnt come out in the last 6 years.  But I caught this in the middle of the night on mtv hits while flipping the channels (I write sins) and I couldnt change the station.  Then I put it out of my mind.  But for some reason about 3 weeks later I came back to that song and I looked the band up.  Within a few days I had the entire album memorized because its absolutely brilliant.  And the fact that its a bunch of guys my age?  Amazing.  I love it.  I don't like Camisado much, but the rest of the tracks blow me away.  I would recommend the last half of the cd because its the best in content and sound in my opinion.  And the last track is arguably the best one on the cd, thought my personal favorite is \\"Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off\\" What can I say I like the way he says the 'f' word.  Its really unique to me because like I said, this isnt my genre.  But I pride myself in enjoying good music no matter what genre it is, and this is great music.  I havent stopped listening to it yet and its been over a week.  Do yourself a favor and stop obsessing over what genre you like and who you think they're trying to sound like and give it a chance.  Its clever, witty, and almost obnoxiously catchy (i've gotten three people hooked to this band so far) but I promise, if you appreciate good music, you will like this cd.
0002171856|5.0|The SAS handbook is a wealth of remarkably useful information and startlingly devised survival techniques.  Survival, in the most literal sense, is something the ordinary person needn't worry about these days.  However, exploring the ingenuity of mans survival skills can prove exciting and intriguing.  This handbook addresses so much survival knowledge that I have read it through and through numerous times over the years, and I still seem to be surprised whenever I dust it off for a browse.  Great book...
B000G8NXYG|5.0|A ferocious bandit clan.  A village without hope or money.  Seven desperate ronin, each with their own story to tell.  And a battle that will decide all their fates.  Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI has inspired generations of filmgoers and filmmakers.  And the great thing about SEVEN SAMURAI?  It's not a stuffy period film.  This film MOVES.  It's action-packed, with real characters that you care about.  It's a rich tapestry of action, emotion, and bravura filmmaking that has not really been topped since. <br /> <br />Criterion did this film justice with the last single-disc release, especially the commentary which felt like Kurosawa 101, entertaining and informative.  Mr. Jeck's commentary remains on this new version, and Criterion has stepped up to bring us the definitive SEVEN SAMURAI disc.  Commentaries.  Documentaries.  A two hour (!) interview with Master Kurosawa himself.  Essays.  And a newly subtitled high-definition transfer that will have fans drooling in anticipation. <br /> <br />If there's one DVD to own... this one is it.  And if you haven't seen this film yet... I envy you.  Because when you do, your world's going to be changed.  The best film ever made, now has an edition worthy of its greatness.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Purchasing this retrospective on Huey Lewis and The News has been one of the best CD purchases I have made in quite some time.  Writing a review for an item like this is simple.  It is quite apparent that this project was taken very seriously by all those involved, and the presentation all around is slick and professional.      First, the packaging is exquisite.  Featuring liner notes by Lewis himself, a fun trip down memory lane by superfan Jimmy Kimmel (who apparently regularly hosts The News on his talk show), and then a critical analysis by journalist Paul Liberatore, the buyer is afforded a little perspective on the impact of the band over the years...from its lead singer, from a fan and then from a critic's point of view.  All three essays show that Huey Lewis and The News effected a lot of people through the years and provided great memories through their music, concerts, and of course, their classic early-era MTV videos.    Secondly, the songs have never sounded better.  I owned several vinyl albums by this band back in the 1980s and the remastering job on this CD is excellent...the songs have a great bounce and sound thick coming through the speakers.  Moreover, the song selection is near perfect, and superior to their old greatest hits compilation released in the mid-1990s.  I rediscovered \\"Hope You Love Me Like You Say You Do,\\" one of their earliest singles and a song worthy of the larger audience it receives here.  Also very enjoyable was late-era News material, especially the late '80s tunes \\"Perfect World\\" and \\"Small World,\\" and the early '90s hits \\"But It's Alright,\\" \\"Couple Days Off\\" and \\"It's Alright.\\"  My only concern with the song selection was that a couple of my old favorites were omitted (probably due to time constraints), including \\"Walking on a Thin Line\\" and 1991's \\"It Hit Me Like a Hammer.\\"  But with iTunes, I simply downloaded those two songs and added them to the album on my iPod.      Another note on the packaging---there are tons of great pictures of the band included...from their MTV days, old album and single covers and more, which makes the listen that much better.  The release date and chart position for every song is also included, and it reminded me just how many radio hits this band had in their time.      Once again, this is one of the best purchases I have made in a while.  \\"Greatest Hits\\" is the perfect summer soundtrack and has allowed me to take a stroll down memory lane, remembering the days when I was kid and listening to this music the first time around.  There is another version of this album where the CD is packaged with a bonus DVD featuring the band's music videos, but the VH1 Classic channel has been airing many Huey Lewis and The News videos lately that I didn't feel it necessary to buy.  After enjoying this CD as much as I have, I am now regretting not picking it up for posterity.      Highly recommended.
0679457607|5.0|Proposes, defends, and offers detailed first-hand phenomenological insight into a radical (by Western standards) approach to learning that maintains the master skill of all learning is \\"relaxed concentration\\" (p. xiii) coupled with trust in the body's (and mind's) ability to learn. As a sequel to the author's previous work on learning to play tennis, the book provides instruction, examples, and encouragement in becoming receptive to a natural form of learning based on focused attention and non-judgmental awareness. While the approach admittedly can seem somewhat Zen-like to most Westerners, it is consistent with the Socratic learning approach underlying much of classical education. <br /> <br />Oh, and by the way, it WILL reduce your handicap.
0385720920|4.0|Though I loved the film version of FIGHT CLUB, I must admit that Chuck Palahniuk's cult novel didn't impress me.  However, I enjoyed his writing style, so I decided to read some more of his work.  The premise of CHOKE intrigued me, so I decided to read that next. <br /> <br />CHOKE is the story of Victor Manicini, a former medical student who was forced to leave school to pay his mother's medical bills, as she has recently been placed in a nursing home.  To pay the bills, Victor goes to restaurants and pretends to choke on his food.  He discovers that people will rush to save him, and then, out of pity, send him money or do favors for him.  When Victor is not choking on assorted kinds of food, he is engaging in a variety of sexual encounters with various women.  Flashbacks show us that Victor's mother was rather loony even when younger, and by telling Victor conspiracy theories and other bits of disturbing information, she has made him unable to have a lasting relationship with women.  Victor does have a relationship - if you could call it that - with his \\"best friend\\", Denny, another sexaholic who begins collecting rocks to forget about his desires. <br /> <br />It took me a while to get into CHOKE.  Chuck Palahniuk's novels are usually very dark and depressing, cynical and nihilistic, but they're also quirky and funny.  Once Palahniuk establishes the characters, and gives us an idea of the situation, he allows his style to come out, and this was when I got hooked.  Still, CHOKE is more-or-less just a series of moments in Victor's life and it doesn't really tell an epic tale, as in FIGHT CLUB; however Palahniuk is such a talented writer that it takes one quite a while to notice, and by the time one does notice, we're too hooked to care.  Certainly the greatest part of the novel is the ending, a brilliant finale which explodes out of nowhere and will leave your head spinning for a long while after finishing the book. <br /> <br />CHOKE may not be a masterpiece, butit's a very fine novel that Palahniuk fans should dig.
B000002AD0|5.0|This is a great album for fans of Santana's early work, the Latin/blues/rock fusion sound that made them unique among the zillions of hippie bands of the era.  This album lacks Mike Shrieve's drumming and is shy a couple of Latin percussionists but Carlos's blazing guitar work carries the whole show along anyway.  Although raw and less polished than the 1st Santana album, this album ROCKS - even the extended 60's jams are fun.  The accompanying liner notes booklet is informative and the sound quality is first rate.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This is the best TV show I've seen in a long time. I don't watch much TV, mainly because I'm tired of the laugh tracks and same awkward moment-stuck in a jam- antics that play out night after night. This series takes you away and draws you in. Yes it's simple, yes it's cheesy at times, but it is entertaining and I absolutely love the characters, even after watching just the first 2 episodes.  A friend told me to watch it on my flight, I did, and I'm hooked.  Bring it back. <br /> <br />Brett
0316172324|1.0|For someone who is writing a book about the ability to suscinctly understand things without any elaboration, this author drags on his points like none I've ever seen.  He puts 5 word concepts into 20 word runon sentences, just like this one, that contain extra phrases and words that really dont quite necessarily need to exist in the particular sentences when you could, if you wanted to, make them significantly smaller and much less burdensome in length.  If you enjoyed reading that last sentence, you will love this book.  I got about halfway through and it was a struggle to continue.  I actually signed on to Amazon.com tonight purely to see if anyone else was as miserable as myself, reading this book, and I was glad to see so many were.  Blink is brilliant in one sense:  He put a lot of psychology into getting his book sold.  He puts it in airports, he made a ghostly looking coolly designed cover, and he put enthralling teaser material on the inside of the cover.  That's pretty much the only thing I was impressed by with this book.  Im sure he's a nice guy but .. zzzz.
B000EHSVQE|1.0|This movie has got to be the biggest turd ive ever had to watch. Its worse than the Envy, and thats really bad. I understand that alot of people find this movie funny (I mean ALOT), but I myself cannot find it in the least bit funny. When I heard that Nacho Libre was being made by the same guy I was skeptical, but, thanks to Jack Black, that movie turned out to be very funny and done in good taste. This movie, on the other hand, is unfunny as possible, the acting is atrocious and poor John Header will never be able to live this role down. Im sorry my friend, but doing this movie was the worst career move ever.
0553296981|5.0|What is remarkable about Anne Frank's diary, more than that it has survived for an audience of readers, is Anne Frank's mature outlook on life and the world.  It is often hard to believe that this is the writing of a 14 year old girl.  Thousands of books are available that view World War II through the eyes of an adult.  Yet this book is one of the few that gives us a view of a Jewish child in Europe during World War II.<br /><br />\\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" is written largely as a series of letters to an imaginary friend named Kitty.  All of Anne's frustrations, fears, and musings are confessed in her diary.  She is an adolescent female undergoing the same feelings of most adolescent females in unusual circumstances.  Not only is Anne worried about Hitler and the Jewish concentration camps, but she is trying to break from her parents at a time when leaving her home is a risk to her life.  Co-habiting with another family, she also has the privilage of finding love as a teenager.  This creates some peculiar scenarios for Anne.<br /><br />The great misfortune of this book is that the book ends when it seems Anne is on the verge of a major epiphany.  She seems to be on the cusp of making a major self discovery, only to be hauled away from her family to her death.  This is only one of the reasons that this book is so heartbreaking. Yet this is one of the elements that makes it one of the most important books written in the 20th Century.
B00005JLD4|5.0|In 1931, Australian Aboriginal Molly Craig and two younger kin were sent by the Australian government to a camp whose task was to train them as domestic workers and gradually integrate them into white society.   <br /> <br />Molly escaped and led one family member home following Australia's \\"Rabbit Proof Fence\\" back to where she belonged.  Later, she and her children were recaptured and sent back to the camps.  She escaped a second time with a babe in arms and came back to her home.  <br /> <br />This is a harsh piece of history to view.  Frankly, some of the discussion of how Australia was planning to 'assimilate' the Aboriginals truly offended and horrifed me, but this is a piece of Australia's history and quite effectively mirrors our own in the US with respect to American Indians.   <br /> <br />\\"Rabbit Proof Fence\\" is beautifully filmed, scored, and performed.  The actress who played Molly is effective, powerful, and evocate.  Aborignal actors and consultants were used to make the film have the look and feel of a period piece and be a true reflection of Aborignal culture.   <br /> <br />I rented this film, but I'm planning on buying it.  While this is a hard story to watch, I believe it's something everyone--especially young women--should see.

There's plenty of energy, hard driving riffs and complex arrangements executed with precision the way only they can deliver. There are also plenty of what some call filler but are truely spiritual meditations. Try zoning out to them and see where the merkaba takes you. The real extra here is the packaging, stereoscopic images with it's own viewer built right in, amazing. I thank Tool for preserving the lost art of album design.
0446577383|5.0|I read THE CAMEL CLUB because the description.  I thought it was going to be like Nelson DeMille's THE LION GAME.  After completing the couple of chapters, I thought I made right the decision.  However, the next couple of chapters were trite, extremely slow moving and I found myself skipping pages and becoming very distracted.  Nevertheless, I forced myself to move on.  With this, I can make three points that will help a person decide if he/she wants to read this book.<br /><br />First, THE CAMEL CLUB can be best summarized as high - low - high.  That is, the intensity of the writing is inconsistent.  I dare say that the writing pattern within THE CAMEL CLUB demonstrates an inconsistency that I have never experienced within last 20 years of reading.  The pattern goes like this: the author captures the reader's imagination and distracts the readers from all life events.  Later, the writing becomes unfocused, shallow, trite and seemingly without direction.  Many readers are likely to give up and stop reading.  I say continue - don't stop reading!  After completing the book, I went back and read sections I skimmed and skipped.  The writing style didn't seem bad during the second reading.<br /><br />Second, I suspect that the distracting elements within these chapters are caused by the untraditional manner of character development.  The main characters - members of the Camel Club - were underdeveloped while the secondary characters are overdeveloped.  Baldacci spent too much effort focusing on the Secretary of Defense and too little effort on the club members.  In this fashion, the Secretary of Defense emerged into an unrealistic caricature rather than a character.  Although the other characters (particularly the Camel Club) were clearly off the beaten path, they continued to fall within the path of reasonableness, while others (Secretary of Defense, Vice President, among others) were so far removed from reality; they possessed a comic book quality.<br /><br />Third, with all the weaknesses, THE CAMEL CLUB has one great strength; \\"learning through the novel.\\"  A person can study culture in an academic setting without understanding it on a gut level.  THE CAMEL CLUB offers an opportunity for reader to obtain a deeper and more complex understanding of various Middle East cultures.  I found the cultural logic of food preparation, prayer, abstinence, war, violence, and death insightful and more importantly useful.  THE CAMEL CLUB helps make sense of our current problems in the Middle East.<br /><br />Thus, 5 stars for leaning; 5 stars for storyline; 4 stars for character development.<br /> <br />Third, with all the weaknesses, THE CAMEL CLUB has one great strength; \\"learning through the novel.\\"   A person can study culture in an academic setting without understanding it on a gut level.

1594481938|5.0|Martin, a disgraced minor television personality, convicted of child molestation, is about to commit suicide by jumping from a tall building in London. He meets Maureen, a lonely 53 year-old single mother with a handicapped son, also there to commit suicide.  They are joined by a Jess, a delinquent teenage girl, also there for the same purpose.  They get talking, and along comes JJ, an  American musician, reduced (as he sees it) to delivering pizza, and also there to kill himself.  They share the pizza, get talking, and decide to postpone the deed.  Eventually they give up altogether (on suicide).  I was reminded of Victor Frankl's suggestion in \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" that thinking about suicide can be beneficial because it leads you to consider the reasons against doing it.  The story is told in the voice of each of the four characters, and is full of dark insights and black humor. In fact it's quite a funny and entertaining book. The four authorial voices are relentlessly honest and colloquial, addressing the reader in an intimate way.  Martin sounds like the protagonist of \\"High Fidelity\\" and \\"About a Boy.\\" Jess's British juvenile slang may need translating for American readers. In spite of the cynicism and sophistication of the others, it is Maureen, the naïve devout Christian who carries the book to an inspiring and heart-rending climax.
B00000JLWW|4.0|...James Cameron is an action-flick hack director of \\"Terminator\\" fame and actually wrote this film's screenplay, so I rented it with low expectations, just wanted something easy and mindless to kill 3 hours with on a slow Saturday night, and being a longtime fan of the ever-spunky Aussie babe Kate Winslet (who looks much better as a blonde than a redhead, I might add), I figured what the hell...<br /><br />I was surprised that the computer animation was actually not very impressive; at no moment did the boat in the film ever look like it WASN'T just a smaller-scale, computer-animation-enhanced model.  Probably a result of being used to today's level of computer animation which is light years beyond what was available during the mid/late 90s when this film was made.<br /><br />YES, the film does take very long to tell its story, the first 10 minutes with the framing narrative of present-day sea explorers digging through the shipwreck was pretty tedious all right.<br /><br />YES, there are some awful bits of purple and bombastic dialogue that no human being with a pulse would say in real life (especially DiCaprio's speech at the fat cats' dinner party about the Romantic and Zenlike glories of his wandering artist's existence).<br /><br />YES, the film does take a sudden schizoid turn into more typical Cameron action-potboiler during the last hour after the boat finally smacks into the iceberg, with plenty of stock Hollywood cliffhanger moments (y'know: the hero and heroine seem completely doomed but against all odds somehow manage to miraculously pull it out at the last second and narrowly escape some gruesome death in order to repeat that experience in about 30 seconds of screen time).<br /><br />HOWEVER, there were 2 highly redeeming aspects of this film that completely surprised and impressed me:<br /><br />1.

B00005JOX6|3.0|Well, the expectations for this movie were high, and the film starts off quite funny in typical Sandler goofball mode. The morale of the story too is actually excellent: relax a bit and family first and then work -- otherwise the kids will grow up too fast and you'll never see them and you grow old and die. <br />So there are a number of good principles in it. The problem is that somehow this is supposed to be a comedy and a clean comedy it is definitely not ... too many references to sexual practices of humans and dogs and so forth. Four-letter words are prevalant too. It's embarrasing to take your 14 year old or even younger one with you to see this flick. <br />Don't misunderstand, the premise for the film is very good, but the execution is just lacking. I mean Sandler is the goofball and that's funny for the most part in the beginning, but somewhere in the middle of the movie the more serious part of the story develops and the funny parts fade away. And there's a lot about sex in this flick and it deserves a solid R Rating.
1400034779|5.0|In an attempt to better my reading girth, I've been tackling well-known, well-written books this summer. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency was such a happy surprise. I learned lessons about simplicity, joy, and human decency while being carried along by a beautifully written story. The prose is sparse but effective and the voice is one of the best I've read. I highly recommend this book.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I call this album THE SEED.  Most Pearl Jam fans know it as AVOCADO.  Technically, it's just PEARL JAM.  Whatever the name, it is a powerful collection of 13 songs that adds up to more than the sum of the parts.  While the lyrics are not all direct and transparent, it seems clear that the central focus of this 2006 release is the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  And Pearl Jam is against the wars, but for those who fight in them.  \\"World Wide Suicide\\" and \\"Marker In the Sand\\" are clearly anti-war statements, but \\"Army Reserve\\" is completely sympathetic to the troops.<br /><br />This is a coherent statement such as the band has never before attempted, let alone accomplished.  The first five songs are all hard and fast rockers, setting an implacable tone.  The last song is stunning and brilliant, written by lead guitarist Mike McCready, not ordinarily one of the main songwriters.  (Eddie Vedder co-wrote the music, but the lyrics are Mike's.)  In the face of death, war, sickness, divorce, unemployment, we must reach within for our inner reserves.  It's an inside job.  Don't despair, reach within.  The seed of change lies within...  A mark of a great album is that it is tied together with a powerful conclusion -- here is a perfect example.<br /><br />This was the first Pearl Jam album I ever bought.  Of course I had heard their hits on the radio, like everyone else.  But only since THE SEED have I really tuned in to the band.  I have come to appreciate their thoughtful lyrics, their stylistic diversity, and their political commitment.<br /><br />Their most recent studio album (BACKSPACER) seems like a lightweight time-filler compared to this one.  Here's hoping they come roaring back with more music this powerful next time!<br /><br />[I long since deleted my original review.  This new one was written on 11/9/11.]
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I had heard a few of DCFC songs on XM and seen them on a few late night talk shows, but when I really fell in love with them was at Bonnaroo.  They are pros.  I came home and immediately bought their CD, Plans.  I generally just download MP3s, but they were so impressive live that I wanted the whole CD.  I plan to buy more of their CDs, but I still haven't tired of Plans.
0596005903|1.0|This book was so badly written that I just couldn't help writing my first review on Amazon. I NEVER bothered writting reviews. <br /> <br />While I fully respect the authors' decision in providing the book online under the Creative Commons license, and while I do not doubt the sincerity of their intentions, the book is a total f*ck up. And f*ck up is an understatement. <br /> <br />The book: <br />1) Is unorganized :- <br /> <br />I felt I was being bombarded by information from all directions. One moment I was getting ready to test a simple \\"hello world\\" module, and the other I'm suddenly faced with a some strange esoteric block diagram showing \\"how function calls and function pointers are used in a module to add new functionality to a running kernel.\\" with strange function names that were not mentioned and do not get mentioned for the rest of the chapter. How the hell did I get here? It just pisses you off and breaks your thought process and leaves you clueless and frustrated. <br /> <br />2) Is upside-down:- <br /> <br />I read chapter 3 (Char drivers) and I compare it to real device drivers and some things just don't match. The book seems very theoretical because the \\"real\\" device drivers call some other functions that are not mentioned at all. After digging in the kernel source files and googling the internet I realize that in the \\"real world\\" there is a whole driver-model and generic objects and what not. Reading the source code documentation and some online material I actually understand how the \\"real\\" drivers work. I still don't understand the stuff in the book. I start wondering whether there is any mention of the driver-model  and I find it in chapter 14 !!!!!!! The driver model seems, in my opinion, the first step to understanding how \\"real\\" drivers work and I find it after 14 chapters of utter nonsensce!! Not only that, the authors decide that \\"many driver authors can ignore the device model entirely\\" and \\"The complexity of the device model makes it hardto understand by starting with a high-level view\\"... surpisingly it was easier to understand from online sources and the source code documentation than trying to read chapter 2 in the book! <br /> <br />3) Is sadistic:- <br /> <br />One thing I really hated was the carrot-and-stick approach the authors chose. First they give you a small tiny taste of a topic   which finally seems relevant and just when you feel you're about to reach somewhere, they do a complete u-turn and throw all kinds of irrelevant off-the-topic rubish that leaves you sorry you were so shamefull as to expect any better. You end up confused, annoyed, and duped. Like in chapter 2 when they presented the code for the \\"hello world\\" module. OK fine. Seems easy enough. You naturally assume that this is an invitation to write the same code yourself. HAHA WROONG! The book suddenly does a \\"make hello.c\\" without showing you the content of the makefile. It leaves you out to dry with your uncompilable-\\"hello.c\\" and goes on describing IN DETAIL seemingly random stuff. You are left wondering whether the makefile must have been something too obvious to bother noting down and you start wondering whether to try to create a simple makefile or continue reading the chapter \\"as-is\\". I chose the former. HAHAHA WROONG AGAAIIN! I ended up compiling my whole kernel source tree because of something they decide to mention only 7 sections later.(At least they mentioned it?!) <br /> <br />In summary.. I'd suggest you buy the book.. and (as \\"./Documentation/ManagementStyle\\" for another book says): \\"NOT read it. Burn it, it's a great symbolic gesture\\". <br /> <br />I don't think anyone could have done a better job at making a worse technical book. If you come across any online material that \\"recommends\\" this book, *QUICKLY* discard that material too .. without thinking. <br /> <br />This is a -5 stars book. It has affected me personally.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Most original show to ever grace the realms of television. A sci-fi western from the mind of Joss Whedon (Creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel), Firefly tells the story of eight rebels, and one shepard, on the edge of space. Set 500 years in future this show breaks new ground in mixing genre's. No matter what you have read about this show it is never what you expect, it is better. With excellent actors that bring unique characters to the screen the stories follow suit perfectly. There is action, romance, comedy, and much more. The first 2 scenes of the pilot capture it all. Pay attention though! It is not hard to follow but there is much to learn.
B000063DFN|5.0|Before you read this you should know that i havent heard every maiden album but i have 4 of them and have heard many songs from their other albums. overall POWERSLAVE seems to be the maiden album i always listen to.  Bruce's vocals are amazing and steve harris's bass is  spellbinding.  some say beast is maidens best but i find that this album is ust a bit better. i mainly base that on one song. \\"Rime OfThe Ancient Mariner\\" is a 13 and a half minute long epic and its worth the long time it is my favorite maiden song of all time and its in my 10 favorite songs (believe me i listen to alot of music and my favorite band(GNR) has 3 or 4 songs in that list). anyway i love this albuma nd any fan of classic metal will also love it. <br />albums highlights <br />ACES HIGH <br />2 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT <br />POWERSLAVE <br />RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER
B000F1IQN2|5.0|We're a long way from E.T. now. Stephen Spielberg takes a dramatic look at the revenge that (could have?) taken place following the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games in 1972. While \\"inspired by actual events,\\" we don't know how much of what we are watching is true and how much is made up - a common problem with today's cinema, as well as today's news media. At the beginning of the film, in the optional intro by Spielberg, he says that certain facts (three to be exact) are indisputable. When a filmmaker or writer starts talking about \\"indisputable facts,\\" watch out. Regardless of what Spielberg says in his intro, and regardless of the facts, MUNICH is about the vanity of revenge: how there is no end to it because it only spawns more revenge, and reeks havoc on the souls of those involved in it. No wonder God said, \\"Vengeance is mine; I will repay,\\" and \\"Turn the other cheek.\\"<br /><br />Eric Bana (Troy) is superb as Avner, who must learn these lessons the hard way. He gives up life with his wife and new baby to travel the world, tracking down the 11 men that he has been led to believe were responsible for the massacres in Munich. He has four others with him, none of which have had any experience as assassins. He has a neutral contact man who sells him leads and equipment, ammo, etc. Together the team rigs telephones, TV's, beds, etc. with bombs, in order to take out their victims. Eventually, the hunters become the hunted, so that Avner, on the brink of despair, ends up sleeping in his closet, afraid that someone may have rigged his own phone, his own TV, his own bed.<br /><br />At one point, Avner has a conversation with a Palestinian who, not realizing that Avner is Jewish, tells him that having a homeland is everything, and that if he understood that, he would have sympathies for the Palestinians rather than for the Israelis. Later, Avner's mother tells him how proud she is of him, because he has helped secure a place on earth for Israel. The irony is overwhelming. Avner himself has no home, no place on earth, because he's a man on the run.<br /><br />In another conversation, Robert protests against all the blood they're spilling for Israel, and tells him, \\"We're Jews, Avner. We're supposed to be righteous. That's a beautiful thing. That's Jewish. That's what I knew, that's what I was taught.\\" God promised Israel a place in heaven if they would follow His Law. Yet, in this movie, they are selling their souls, their \\"righteousness,\\" for a place on earth: more great irony. There are many spoken and unspoken truths in this film that warrant ferreting out.<br /><br />The imagery in MUNICH is powerful. Avner loves cooking and often finds himself standing in front of a kitchen store, dreaming of the kitchen he may one day have. His contact man has a \\"pappa\\" who wants to meet with him, so Avner allows himself to be blindfolded and taken somewhere in the Italian countryside. Although it starts out ominously, it turns out to be a kind of holiday, full of children and sunshine, family and cooking - a stark contrast to the rest of the film. It turns out that Pappa is also a gourmet cook, and together they prepare a meal and develop a type of relationship. Pappa tells him that he and Avner are very much alike, \\"tragic men, with butcher's hands but gentle souls.\\" As Avner is leaving, Pappa tells him, \\"You could have been my son...but you're not. Remember that. We'll do business, but you aren't family.\\" Avner realizes that Pappa could just as easily sell his information to the other side as to him, since he has no loyalties. That's when he understands how little his life is worth, and how it can only end badly if he continues with his \\"mission.\\"<br /><br />There is some wonderful filmmaking in MUNICH. The cinematography is beautiful as well as gritty, John Williams score is powerful, and the script is taut. Across the board, the acting is superb, with Daniel Craig (Steve), Ciaran Hinds (Carl), Mathieu Kassovitz (Robert), Hanns Zischler (Hans) and Moritz Bleibtreu (Andreas) as standouts. Many of the images are disturbing, as this is very much an adult drama, with extreme violence as well as nudity - thus the R rating. It is not a feel good movie, but it is a think deep one.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithritz Bleibtreu (Andreas) as standouts.

0380778556|5.0|Du Maurier captures the essence of Victorian hierarchal society in the must-read.  Through her controlled use of dynamic prose, this classic romantic suspense practically turns the pages on its own.  Set in the heart of Maxim de Winter's gargantuan estate, Manderley, the narrator learns about Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, and her untimely death.  This novel proves that some secrets, no matter how hard one may try, refuse to stay buried.
0060989157|5.0|I have read a number of rock bio's, but this one takes the insanity to another level.  Interesting balance of insight into the individual perspectives, presented as individual chapters, from the band memebers and not just a collage from all of the views.
B00005JOSS|1.0|This movie proves once and for all that Keanu Reeves cannot act.  His wooden demeanor does not create any empathy for the character he plays.  And Sandra Bullock obviously has not recovered from the making of CRASH.  She wanders through this film with her eyes glazed over, still exuding the ennui of an L.A. woman who has nothing better to do than get her furs out of cold storage.  She supposed to be a doctor??? Not very convincing, I'm afraid.  Even Jack, the dog, has more stage presence than these two, managing to steal more than one scene from the principals.   <br /> <br />What could have been an light piece of summer fluff got carried away by its own psuedo-serious message.
0312995423|2.0|I really liked Da Vinci Code, but I was disappointed to find that this book wasn't even in the same ballpark. I gave it two stars only because it had the same level of suspense that made it hard to put down. The dialog was terrible - some of the lines towards the end were just plain cheesy. There were a lot of technical holes in the plot that just didn't make any sense.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I have been waiting in anticipation for this movie to be released to video.  This is the best film I have yet to see this year.  Like other reviewers, I love that it makes you think about the type of person you are...what you value, your character, if you would also fight for what you know to be right. <br />The Cinematography, special effects, and score are great.  Superb acting, action sequence, plot...I really can't say enough good things about it.  I can't wait to see it again.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Starring a capable star cast in Cary Elwes (Princess Bride, Glory), Danny Glover (Lethal Weapons) and Leigh Whannell (Matrix Reloaded). If you have not heard about how SAW has change how future murder movies will be made in Hollywood, then you have not seen this movie. This is not your typical senseless dumb killings that litter so many movies in yore past. It's killing that makes you think and go 'oooohhhh i see'. Like how far would you go when survival is at stake ...something you normally do regularly is raised to another level involving your very dear life....would you...could you?  The protagonist stunning protrayal of emotion is shown here to the max which is as real as it gets my friends. The big question i have here to all the fans who seen SAW is this: <br /> <br />Would you \\"SaW\\" off your own foot to save those you loved, if not you?  <br /> <br />Think about it! <br /> <br />It might happen to you one day. This movie will guide you thru the intense horror as you about to witness what fear is really like when it happens to you. Smartly done and highly recommended. I saw SAW II and the original SAW is the one that started it all....a bonified classic!
B0002DB52M|1.0|Dogville is such a long, boring, pretentious movie I have ever seen! I was expecting something great even spectacular but Dogville is highly over-rated and horrible. I like Nicole Kidman, wonderful, gifted actress but why did she do this movie? She must have been out of her ever-loving skull to take this weighty film on her shoulders. Lauren Bacall's acting is so wooden, what's so great about her anyway? Don't waste one second on Dogville, it's awful!
0743487486|5.0|Reading Unconditional Parenting made me ecstatic because Alfie Kohn's basic premise that,\\"Our main question shouldn't be \\"How do I get my child to do what I say?' but `What does my child need- and how can I meet those needs?\\" supports and expands on everything I teach and write about connection parenting.  This is Alfie Kohn's most exciting and powerful book yet. It not only removes any doubts we could have about the ineffectiveness of using punishment as discipline, it is filled with information, inspiration, and ideas for \\"working with children rather than doing things to them.\\" I enthusiastically  recommend Unconditional Parenting to parents who want to move from parenting through coercion and punishment to parenting through love and connection.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|5 stars should be given.  SOAD is going on break and I think they have a right to after this album.  Like Mezmerize, it has its fun, slow, and hard rocking moments.  Vicnity of Obscenity is a fun and odd song, Lonely Day and Soldier Side are perfect examples of slow emotional songs, and hard rocking moments like Attack, and Kill Rock N Roll are perfect examples of the diverse act that is, System Of A Down.  Like I said in my Mezmerize review, they threw Daron's voice in to mix it up, I mean we are talking about SOAD here.  Already a wacky music group, and Daron's voice adds flavor.  System of a Down finishes the year off with a bang just how they entered it...
0736063684|5.0|Delavier's Strength Training Anatomy is an excellent guide for personal trainers, massage therapists, or anyone who wants to know more about exactly what muscles are worked by what exercise.  His illustrations are both beautiful and highly informative, and the text explains how to perform the exercise in a clear, concise fashion.<br /><br />Also, the segments on safety and avoiding injury are helpful and well-written.  I recommend this book highly!
B0000027RL|5.0|It helped make grunge what grunge is. <br /> <br />That is, great. <br /> <br />Pearl Jam's debut is one of the best debuts of all time IMO.  With songs 1-6 being my favorites.  Even Flow and Once are my favorites all in all, they have Eddie with a great display of vocal range in these songs.  This was the first album in a great career of a band.
B00000255F|5.0|First, let me preface this by saying that I am NOT a rabid fan of Springsteen's body of work post \\"Born to Run\\".  That said, I was 15 years old when I had the opportunity to see a 1977 Springsteen concert, and that show still stands as one of my favorite concerts of all time.  Born to Run was played almost in its entirety, and immediately became a part of my vinyl collection immediately afterwards.<br /><br />I consider the lyrics on this album to be at a level only achieved by a very elite group (Dylan's \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", ironically also released in 1975, is very comparable).<br /><br />Ignore political views (remember, if we sanctioned music based on politics or other hot topics of the day, I am not sure there would be much left) and add this to your collection.  It will survive the test of time and will outlive all of us.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Well I remember 3 months before it came out I was really excited.  I bought the Dani California single off iTunes for some reason, well it was good but I usually hold off.  The album came out and it was hard to listen to at first, and I don't exactly know why.  Maybe because it was 28 new songs, all that material is something to take in.  I have taken all the songs in at this point and I truly believe that the RHCP earn a 5 star review.  This album goes WAY past their single, even if the song was supposedly ripped off (Tom Petty - Mary Jane's Last Dance).  I don't even care if they ripped it off or not, Petty needs the money and the Chilis dont.  Oh well.. <br /> <br />In total I have listened to both discs about 5 times.  It never really gets old, and it's also a lot more mellow then the Chilis were in the BSSM days.  By The Way was an obvious indicator that they were mellowing down, the reason being age perhaps.  During BSSM with Give It Away and Suck My Kiss they were young guys, but after all their hardships and time in the business they are possibly growing tired, and older.  I don't think that we will see BSSM days anymore, but I'm thankful they can produce this, being mellow or not. <br /> <br />Thanks RHCP.
0553212419|5.0|If you a Sherlock Holmes fan this is a great book to read.       I like this Volume that I order Volume II to read this summer.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System Of A Down came back with a bang.  The new cd is diverse with fun moments, slow moments, and rockin' moments.  You have your songs like Old School Hollywood for fun, your Lost In Hollywood for slow, and of course BYOB for a hard rocking song.  Though it lower then 40 minutes long, it is well worth the time sitting and listening.  SOAD adds Daron the guitarist to sing in this CD and in my opinion it's a good thing.  It's because SOAD has always been an interesting act, and to add even more wackiness they add in his high pitch voice (which sometimes get annoying) to spice it up even more.  There's a reason you can appreciate Daron's voice, SOAD is so different already you just could've seen something like this happening.
B00005OM4N|3.0|After 2 highly recommended albums, her debut and sophmore had brought her huge sucess, her 3rd album lacks. Alot. She's lot the catchy songs she had in her previous two, and her album doesn't feel like Britney Spears, the pop queen. <br /> <br />I'M A SLAVE 4 U: It's not a bad opening, but it sure doesn't compare up to what Baby One More Time and Oops I Did It Again did to her 2 previous albums. The song is sexual, but it just really isn't \\"fascinating\\". 6/10. <br /> <br />OVERPROTECTED: Not as good as the opening. She feels \\"overprotected\\" and wishes to be free and independent. She wants to take more chances. This song is mediocre. 5/10. <br /> <br />LONELY: So far better than the first 2 in my opinion. It shows some reminiscence of her reign in pop. But her harsh cooing needs to stop. 7/10. <br /> <br />I'M NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN: Britney doesn't fair well when it comes to slow songs (unless it was From the Bottom of My Broken Heart and Lucky which were fantastic). This is because Britney doesn't \\"belt\\" (using massive lung power to produce great power in voice a.k.a. Mariah Carey, Whiteny Houston, Christina Aguilera). \\"Belters\\" usually have great slow songs, and since Britney doesn't have it, it...doestn' work at all. This song just is weird. She's not a girl, not yet a woman...is she a guy? 3/10. <br /> <br />BOYS: This song is groovy, pretty upbeat, her most \\"sexual\\" song by far. She's talking about this boy she spots during a dance and is raving about his features. This song isn't bad, the song does get boring after lots of hearing though 7/10. <br /> <br />ANTICIPATING: She sounds WAY to childish in this. Her voice is too girly, and doesn't hold the maturity to make it a good song. This song is...not good. 3/10. <br /> <br />I LOVE ROCK N' ROLL: A version by Britney. Should not have adapted one, she ruins it. However, Britney gets some point for at least trying and putting effort into it. 5/10. <br /> <br />CINDERELLA: I think this is the best track on this album. What she's trying to get to us through this song I've been trying to figure out, but no matter, it's a great song! 10/10. <br /> <br />LET ME BE: This song is mediocre. There's nothing particularily bad about it, but nothing particularily good about it. Her voice sounds scarily not like hers in the beginning. She wants to be left alone in this song. We'll leave this song then...5/10. <br /> <br />BOMBASTIC LOVE: This is (I must admit), a very sizzly song. It's pretty hot acutally. Really cool, just a midtempo song, but with alot of bang to it! 10/10. <br /> <br />THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE ME: This song sounds absolutely trash. It's ridiculous. The lyrics are stupid, the voice sounds rather dumb, she tries to go for a slower song, it doesn't work out, and just...if you have the chance, skip it when you play it. 1/10. <br /> <br />WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME: A funky closing. This album left it having holes. It didn't feel complete like her previous two. Just sort of, left us hanging there in a way. This song maybe should have been put in the middle...cuz this song doesn't do that good of a job completing this album. <br /> <br />TOTAL: 62/120...which is 52%...or 2.5 stars. (I round up).
B0001NBMBC|5.0|The intro preludes as to what is coming in the third Slipknot album.  It's a little more mellow to begin and that's exactly the course the album takes.  Immediately after, it blasts off and it has begun.  This is probably Slipknot's most radio friendly commercial album.  Too many of their fans crave a redone self-titled, but I am not that shallow or idiotic.  I'll accept what these guys do as long as it is something worth listening to.  This CD definately is..  The Blister Exists is a great song, the drumming is pretty cool.  The chorus is pretty cool as well - \\"I am all, but what am I? Another number that isn't equal to any of you.  I control but I comply.  Pick me apart, then pick up the pieces.\\"  In my opinion that is one the best part of the song.  The hook on it is so... well, hooking I guess.  Three Nil is also a great song.  The song reminds you that Cory is a great vocalist.  You may not be able to see his range in vocals here, but his style is perfect for him.  My favorite lyrics on this are - \\"This is not my war, this is not my fight.  This is something more, this is not my life.\\"  There's just something to it that hooks you to the song.  Duality is the first song I heard off the album, and probably the same for everyone.  I don't have much to say on the song, it's a heavy song with good lyrics and in my opinion it's one of the best songs by Slipknot.  Opium Of The People begins with cool guitar sounds.  It's a shorter song and fast paced which makes it short and sweet.  Circle is an acoustic song, and it's one of my favorites on the album.  Vermillion is one everyone has heard so is Pulse of the Maggots.  Both favorites of mine in the Slipknot collection.  Vermillion Pt. 2 is a great follow up to the original Vermillion.  It really fits in.  Overall I think this is Slipknot Lite but still their best album.
B00007GZQI|5.0|So what's wrong with this movie?  Why are all of these people on Amazon say it's \\"boring\\" or only worth seeing as a historical relic?  Perhaps they are just feeling a bit left out.<br />These people will immediately recognize that this humor is not to their taste.  But you should take a look for yourself.  You may find that all of the \\"flaws\\" that others see are actually effective elements here.<br />Exposition has been paired down to the minimum.  Do you really want all of that exposition in your screwball comedy?  I'd rather skip ahead to the larfs.<br />There are a lot of laughs.  Everyone who likes this movie picks a different favorite moment.<br />I enjoy the absurdist tone of the scenes.

B000F5GNX8|4.0|As a complete sucker for all things hardboiled and noir (my patron saint is Raymond Chandler), I was probably the perfect audience for KISS KISS BANG BANG, a humorous pastiche of the pulpy detective tales and film noir classics of yesteryear.<br /><br />Self-referential to the nth degree, the storyline of KISS KISS is ridiculously spotty, but it's such good fun, I hate to quibble with any of it. It's an enjoyable, intelligent movie. Still, it must be pointed out that having Michelle Monaghan play Robert Downey's high school contemporary was just plain dumb. He's 11 years her senior... and he's seen a lot of hard road. That aside, the witty tweaks and nods with the genre's formula are more than enough to compensate for this misstep. Nicely done!<br /><br />SIDELIGHT: Thank goodness that Johnny Knoxville of JACKASS fame was replaced by Downey in the lead role. Robert had his character's clueless, wounded persona down, and served as a great foil for the unexpectedly funny Val Kilmer.
0060899190|5.0|Wow!<br /><br />I work in my school library every summer, and this year we accidently recieved a box full of Post Secret Books. I took one home thinking I might flip through it over the weekend. I got home and opened it up to page one. From then on, I could not be disturbed.<br /><br />This book contains secrets (sad, funny, big, small, horrifying, inspiring) of every kind from ordinary people, people just like you and me.  I guarantee you will be able to connect on some level or another with at least one of these secrets.  Each secret is written on a post card, and the various post cards are depicted in this book. These are the real secrets of real people, secrets that have never been said aloud. When the secrets were written down... fears, guilts, hopes, and dreams were relinquished or re-examined for the better.<br /><br />After admiring the colorful pages and reading the heartfelt words of this book, I got up and made some post cards of my own.<br /><br />The things that make us so different are really the things that make us all the same...  Reading this book will help you respect the things you take for granted, re-examine your life and yourself, and help you realize you are never alone in your troubles or joys. This is a MUST READ! Please, take my advice and do so. This is a life-changer, and perhpas a world-changer!
0764574124|4.0|A good book to start with.  It does a nice job of exposing the reader to the most vital features of VBA for Excel.  Someone with no programming experience can read this and finish capable of writing a wide range of useful macros for their needs.

0312335164|4.0|My wife was reading Da Vinci Code and I didn't want to infringe on her parade, so I read Digital Fortress. I like Brown's writing style, simple, great description, keeps you involved. It's been awhile since I read a novel, but this was a easy read for a non-reader. Took me 4 days on-and-off. It is a good story - a little hokey in some spots - you ask yourself \\"what?\\" not in suspense, but scratching your head on the far fetched ideas that seem to pile up. - a little 'Hollywood' flavor. However, Brown's writing style warms you up for better reads. Reading Da Vinci now and Angels/Demons is easier to understand knowing how he writes. For a few bucks and a few days at the beach, Fortress is worth the read...before Da Vinci. After, well...you decide. It will be interesting to see his next code-breaking fiasco in words!
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|I have had two of his songs since I first heard them on scrubs about a year ago. I feel in love with them and wanted more. But at the time, he only had an EP which was hard to find. So, once I saw his album, I bought it immediately and loved every song. Very warm and sincere. If you like Elliott Smith or Nick Drake, you will dig this album. Uhh, if you don't know who those two previous artists were, get out from your rock and listen to all three of these amazing songwriters.

6305922756|5.0|I always loved this movie,  but the special edition is even better.  The deleted scenes are like a whole 'nother movie.  Seriously they're about an hour long and were probably only cut for time because it's some funny stuff too. <br /> <br />The commentary by the guys from Spinal Tap in character is hilarious.  These guys are great at improv,  which is what a lot of the movie was.   <br /> <br />If you love this movie,  get the special edition DVD now.  You won't be dissapointed.
630463949X|3.0|As a Fleetwood Mac nut, I found this somewhat less than overwhelming.  I think I found out why on the back cover:  it states, \\"Filmed in front of a live audience at Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank, CA\\"--in onther words, not really a live, paid concert.  Maybe that's why, a.) the USC Trojan Marching Band (which guest on \\"Tusk\\" and \\"Don't Stop\\"), while prominent in the audio-only versions, are barely audible here, and b.) the audience, which you would think would be jumping with the music, barely looks awake throughout the show.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This movie is a serious thank you to the fans of FF7.  There are lots of inside jokes that are there just for us.  I really loved this movie.  I have watched it 3 times since I bought it and I don't tend to watch movies over again so soon.   <br /> <br />All the characters are here.  Plenty of fighting action.  Loads of fun.  Great animation too.  If you are a fan,  check this movie out.  If your not a fan,  become one.
6305313687|3.0|I gave my review this title because in a lot of ways Ed Norton brings some of himself to this film and to \\"Fight Club\\".  There is a similar urban grit and undertone of dispair to both films.  Ed does a good job of being a thug, albiet a somewhat less convincing job of being a convict. In jail he did not harden, in fact he grew complacent. <br /> <br />There were some wonderful moments in this movie, such as when the Principal described the lesser Vinyard as \\"misguided\\" and sets out to straighten him out by taking a personal interest in him. In doing so he demonstrates that education and experience are the best antidotes to self imposed stupidity. <br /> <br />The gun play (especially the \\"gangsta\\" poses\\") was irritating and at the same time ironic given which neo-nazis were using them. The undertone of Political Correctness was, as always, irritating and unnecessary.  I was pleased to note that the Principal dismissed one teacher's concerns about \\"hate\\" while at the same time addressing them head on. <br /> <br />The Neo-Nazis were and are thier own best spokespersons.  Where they fall short is confusing race with culture, ideology and belief systems. They'd would probably be amazed at how much they have in common with conservative persons of color, who also hate crime and self destructive behavior.  Neo-Nazis also fail to recognize just how alien Nazi Germany was to the America that they claim to defend. The idea of \\"volk\\" is not American and I'm not even sure it's really German, given the self identity of provinces in Germany and German speaking nations. <br /> <br />None the less there is something that suggests that our modern era's penchant for class identity and community must surely be creating pressures for whites to band together. Perhaps if we thought of ourselves more as \\"I\\" and not as \\"we\\" there might be less reason for hate groups? <br /> <br />This movie isn't bad, but I did not assign it a high rating because of the heavy use of cliches and stereotypes - on both sides.  I think as a morality play it might have been improved by more attention to people and less attention to ideology. In this sense \\"American History X\\"  comes close to \\"Fight Club\\", another entertaining movie which also did not burden itself very much with logical consistency.
630512762X|5.0|Ok could this really happen who knows but It is the What If's movies pose that make them so much fun to watch.  This movie starts off with some awesomely crafted what if's and over the next hour or so weaves them all into an incredible action adventure tapastry that is complex, funny, wierd, thrilling, frightening and more.  This movie absorbs you so completely you feel as if you are almost part of the action.  When it comes to action this movie has lots of it bombarding your senses and emotions almost non-stop from beginning to ending credits.  I won't spoil the movie for you any more than to say if you like really ripping seat of the pants action adventure you NEED to BUY this MOVIE.  This movie will blow your hair back in ways that equal or best anything Agent 007 has up his sleave.<br /><br />Adding this movie to my collection was a serious no-brainer.  I saw how awesome this movie was on some nutty satalite channel and when it ended I walked to my living room computer popped into AMAZON.com. Before I knew it Face Off was in my shopping cart and purchased immediately afterwards.
0553582445|5.0|I read the Farseer Trilogy and jumped right into these books. It is a testament to how good they are that I read all six books one after the other without a pause. At the risk of sounding sexist, I will say (again) that female fantasy writers seem to have a knack for evoking an emotional response in me that I don't find elsewhere. And Robin Hobb is, so far, the best of the best. I was so wrapped up in these books and these characters that they became one of those sign-posts that mark periods in life for me. Very human, very believable. Cant' recommend them enough.
B00005JP4U|5.0|Go see this movie without hesitation if you care at all about the world you and your children and their children will live in.  The former VP uses charts, graphics, pictures and stories to paint a compelling and frightening picture about the future of the earth. <br /> <br />The current administration should be forced to watch this and forced to acknowledge that their only concern over the past 6 years has been to line the pockets of their friends at the expense of the planet.   <br /> <br />Gore uses a plain style with some humor to outline the cause of global warming.  This is not the stiff Al Gore of the 2000 campaign but an involved, caring man who sees the future we will create if we don't act now. <br /> <br />This is an important film, one that people from all political points of view except perhaps the extreme right can learn from.  This film is a call to arms for America and the world whose subject is just as important as the war on terror.   <br /> <br />See it.  Get your friends to see it.  Get you enemies to see it.  Before our last chance to fix anything goes up in a puff of smoke.  You owe it to your children.
0553582461|5.0|After reading the Farseer Trilogy and then these books, the word that came to mind was 'profound'. I was emotionally invested in these books and the conclusion was with me for a long time. Just wanted to chime in with a 5 star rating for the last in the series.
B000F2C87Q|5.0|Everything these guys have put out is gold.  If your favorite White Stripes song is Ball and Biscuit you'll love the Black Keys.  I recommend starting with the Big Come Up and working your way through the albums to this one. <br /> <br />If they don't play a small venue in or around NYC soon I will cry.  For a band that sounds like this to open for Radiohead in MSG for $70 a pop is a joke.

1931559317|5.0|I work at an observatory and use sky atlases and surveys of all sorts.  As a hobbyist I have a collection of various atlases in my field bag.  The Pocket Sky Atlas is now the most used atlas I own.  Its depth of detail is perfect for medium sized (6-12\\") telescopes and good for smaller telescopes and binoculars as well.  The choice of symbols and colors make this an easy chart to read in red light.  It conveniently fits in a small pack or glove box for the observer on the go.

B0002XL35G|5.0|I have rented this movie years ago and remembered that I enjoyed it.  So, I decided to buy a DVD and watched it again.  It's a different kind of movie than the other movies, but it's still enjoyable.  Good acting by Dean Stockwell especially his expressions like from Quantum Leap that I thought was humorous.
B000002I8H|3.0|I admit to liking this somewhat cheesy program. The arrangements are nothing special; they're sort of typical 80's synthesizer schlock (although I gather this '81 release was recorded much earlier), and yet somehow this great singer rises above it all, delivering such a warm, affectionate tribute to the Beatles canon that I enjoy the entire album in spite of my better judgment (regarding production values). I only rate this as low as I do for two simple reasons:  1) to warn away the jazz snobs, the Sarah Vaughan fans who don't like her doing pop, and Beatles purists who don't like their heroes taken too far afield.  2) to point out that the record level on this CD is a tad low, so it doesn't mix well with other discs on a  CD changer's \\"shuffle\\" mode.  I am a Variety Freak, and I love all kinds of music.  I really enjoy mixing it all up, too. I do like lots of jazz, and have collected a fair number of jazz LP's and CD's over the years, but am by no means an expert, so I can't offer anything to the more intellectual jazz lover in the way of advice except to sample this record before buying!
0060899190|5.0|This book was a very interesting read. I highly recommend it. It is definitely worth the money.
0786852550|5.0|Bartimaeus is a demon.  He loves himself unconditionally, so when he is forced to do the wishes of a child of twelve - let's just say he would rather not.  I found this book very interesting, funny, and full of suspense and based on good-old revenge.  Bartimaeus is full of himself and he makes this book exciting.  You might like this book if you like, for example the books on Artemis Fowl.  This, like Artemis Fowl, is a book with a kid who is too smart for his own good, yet not smart enough about the world or with enough experience.  It's a good read, and I especially liked the footnotes. :)
B0000074PH|5.0|Isn't it annoying when you purchase an album that has the most awesome cover art only to discover that the content within is a real clunker? Well, this one is not in that class. This has to be one of my favorite Roger Dean covers (along with Yes' Tales From Topographic Oceans.) I think the first Uriah Heep song I heard was \\"Sweet Lorraine\\" which a friend of mine performed in his band. I was intrigued by the use of synthesizer fills and bought the album, my first by Heep. This is some of the best songwriting I've heard. It lives up to the title, weaving magic spells that fill your mind's eye with the \\"tales\\" being told through the music. It saddens me that many feel this album pales in comparison to \\"Demons and Wizards.\\" I feel it is every bit as strong. Every song is a winner, from the opener \\"Sunrise\\" with it's beautiful instrumentation and David Byron's powerful vocals, to the closing title track, containing one of the finest wah- wah solos ever recorded. The mystical, surreal lyricism pulls you along through a most magical journey that momentarily takes you into new realms outside this somewhat bleak reality. I would liken it to musical fantasy in the same vein as Tolkien's Lord of the Rings with its ability to envoke such imagination and emotion. This still remains my favorite and a memorial of the tragic loss of David Byron (vocals) and Gary Thain (bass) who, I feel, were among the best at what they did. This album stands with ANY of the great classics. If you haven't heard this, you haven't heard Heep!
B00005JOVH|3.0|X-Men The Last Stand is a good Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi movie. The special effects are pretty interesting.<br /><br />And I can see how Ian McKellen can go around saying that this is a movie he personally relates to.<br /><br />Even though I really like Sci-Fi,  and I have seen the previous X-Men movies,  I am really not an expert on X-Men.<br /><br />Basically, the Mutants are fighting for their right to remain Mutants. A \\"cure\\" has been discovered and they don't want<br /><br />to be forced to take the Cure.<br /><br />But the only character I could sympathize with was Angel, played by Ben Foster. This was really the only character in the<br /><br />movie that had any emotional depth.<br /><br />Even in a sci-fi movie, I like to have some sense of who the characters are.<br /><br />The scenes where the Mutants are fighting are pretty good, and with good special effects.<br /><br />And Of course, there is always Hugh Jackman - who is so good looking whatever role he is playing.
B000001ES9|4.0|I won't pretend that this recording can come close to the majesty of Moving Pictures or the groundbreaking progressive metal of 2112, but I have a soft spot in my heart for this album. It was my introduction to all things Rush. I ordered it \\"cold\\" from Columbia House after reading a brief description (no sound bytes back in those days.) After turning- on some friends, before you know it, there was a Rush explosion in my high school! Sure there was no heroic, inimitable drumming per Neal Peart, but the compositions were some of the tightest pure rock songs I had ever heard (naturally Led Zeppelin came to mind.) I loved the ringing open chords and imaginative solos used by Alex Lifeson, that added a different dimension from the ordinary power chords so commonly used at this time (I quickly adopted this style of playing.) I personally think Alex was the most creative soloist since Jimmy Page, not relying solely on blues scales. This is a great rock album. It is raw and powerful,and contains NO weak moments, but don't expect the grandeur of their later epic releases. Still one of my favorites!
B00000IGGA|5.0|It was worth the wait, so to speak, to hear this album. Tom Waits had taken six years off to work on his acting career and some soundtracks, and after the one-two punch of \\"Bone Machine\\" this instant classic was a real knockout. Tracks like \\"Big in Japan\\" are simultaneously amazing and unexpected (you'd never guess it is a Tom Waits song, yet at the same time it's very much a Tom Waits song - you'll know what I mean when you hear it). <br /> <br />I love this album and it's probably my favorite of Waits. I own almost all his albums and this is the one I come back to more than the others.
B00014NE62|5.0|This is a beautifully crafted film, right up there with most other Merchant/Ivory productions. The sense of time and place, the performances, the lyrical mood, the music--all are far above the usual standards of \\"commercial\\" filmmaking. E.M. Forster conveyed a powerful message in his novel, and it's right there on the screen. Still....<br /><br />NOTE TO SCREENWRITERS (with spoilers): As a writer, I was most fascinated by the deleted scenes included with the DVD. There are 2 in particular that I really think Ivory should have kept in the final cut. Watch the film, then watch the deleted material. I'm referring to the scene where Hugh Grant comes to James Wilby's bedroom, and especially the extended version of the final scene between the two on the terrace outside the house. The first scene tells us a lot we really should know about Grant's character. The extended final scene is most important: It is here (in the outtakes) where Maurice (Wilby) has his only moment of strength and resolve. He finally tells his tormentor exactly where to get off the train, and he grows immeasurably in the estimation of the audience. Grant reacts with (momentary) guilt, and when he tries to cover by heartily suggesting the usual lunch in town, Wilby is gone. Grant is left alone on the terrace, calling, \\"Maurice? Maurice?\\" into the empty dark. Now, *that's* an exit for the title character! And it really drives home the power of the (included) final image of Grant in his bedroom later, staring out the window while his clueless wife continues to be clueless in the background. If we'd seen the earlier incident in Maurice's bedroom and the full-length final confrontation, how much more powerful that last image would be! Why, oh why did Ivory cut them?!! See if you agree with me.<br /><br />That aside, this is a remarkable film, one of the few major releases to face a difficult subject head-on (see also: SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN). But those outtakes are extraordinary--a lesson for screenwriters.son for screenwriters.
B00000294R|5.0|ladies and gentlemen, i bring to you big l, the most underrated rapper ever to touch a mic, if you have not yet checked him out, i strongly suggest you do, he was an unbelievable lyricist, and had breathtakingly good punchlines, the beats on this album are all dark, street beats, matching the mood of the songs perfectly, big L had a smooth voice, an amazing flow, and an amazing multi syllable rhyming scheme, and although alot of the stuff he says on this album is shocking, you have to take it all lightly, and although people act like eminem was the first rapper ever to be extremely brutal or shocking in his raps, listen to this, and youll see how much eminem was influenced by this guy, big l does not only rap about guns on this either, he raps about a range of different things, how kids should go to school instead of selling drugs, girls who are golddiggers, the violence of where he grew up, and racism of police, like i said earlier, he had the best punclines ever, and i guarantee you will wear out your rewind button to make sure you got the punchlines,  when big l died it was a great loss to rap, and he was most certainly up there with greats such as nas, biggie, jay z, etc. buy this today if possible
B000F7CMRM|4.0|A meaningful movie, much better than I anticipated.  Very insightful and thought-provoking.  Alexander Siddig steals the show as the Prince. His performance shines.  Clooney gives perhaps his best performance yet. Matt Damon is superb as the American businessman, albeit a fairly straightforward role, he plays it very convincingly.  Terrific!

B00005JOX6|2.0|You either really like Adam Sandler or you loathe him.  He's a polarizing guy.  I really liked him -- until this movie.  It isn't bad enough to walk out of, and there are moments of fun, but a large percentage of it is painful.  Let's start at the beginning.<br /><br />The concept is straight out of Junior League Screenwriting 101 -- 75% borrowed, 25% original.  Actually, make that 85% borrowed.  Like that Twilight Zone episode about the lout who obtains a stop watch that can stop time, Adam Sandler plays a lout who finds a \\"universal remote\\" that can not only pause the world (like the stop watch), but can mute it, rewind it, and fast-forward through all manner of unpleasantness -- and, it turns out, pleasantness as well.  But, it becomes apparent about twenty minutes into the story that the writers are way over their heads.  Not only do the seem to have no imagination as to what a character might really do with a device like this, they start adding \\"rules\\" to try to twist some kind of a character arc out of this device (like this clunky concept -- at least in the hands of these writers -- that the remote \\"automatically programs itself based upon what you do with it\\" that, sadly, becomes the central artifice for the entire movie).<br /><br />Sandler, in addition, has never been less sympathetic.  Not only hasn't he aged well, he's also not really that funny anymore.  The schtick that peppers all of his films really feels like schtick in this movie.  Bad schtick.  I suppose it was inevitable that it would get old.<br /><br />The supporting cast is completely wasted, both with bad lines and stupid set pieces. Christopher Walken, whose facial expressions alone can be comedic genius, visibly struggles with wooden dialogue, and is forced to inhabit an old joke:  the \\"Beyond\\" department of Bed, Bath & Beyond.  (It's one thing when Peter Griffin told this joke a couple of years back on Family Guy, but seeing it resurrected as a centerpiece of this movie is, well, pathetic.  Either the writers were cynics and felt that middle America might still laugh at it, or they thought they were being funny and original. I'm not sure which is worse.)<br /><br />Kate Beckensale is beautiful, but it is impossible to accept her as Sandler's wife.  She's too nice, to sweet, and too attractive.  Now if Click was just a slapstick comedy, we might be able to deal with this.  But that leads to the movie's biggest problem:  It turns into this maudlin and insulting mess, a preachy message movie about \\"family comes first.\\"  At that point, it stops being funny entirely.  It tries pulling at heart strings with these big, clumsy hands.  Frankly, it's just about insufferable.<br /><br />And then, the biggest idiocy of all ... [spoiler alert] ...<br /><br />We find out it was all a DREAM ... but, cliche of cliches ... it really wasn't a DREAM.<br /><br />Don't waste your quarters on this junk.thetic.  Either the writers were cynics and felt that middle America might still laugh at it, or they thought they were being funny and original. I'm not sure which is worse.)  <br /> <br />Kate Beckensale is beautiful, but it is impossible to accept her as Sandler's wife.  She's too nice, to sweet, and too attractive.

But that leads to the movie's biggest problem:  It turns into this maudlin and insulting mess, a preachy message movie about \\"family comes first.\\"  At that point, it stops being funny entirely.  It tries pulling at heart strings with these big, clumsy hands.  Frankly, it's just about insufferable. <br /> <br />And then, the biggest idiocy of all ... [spoiler alert] ... <br /> <br />We find out it was all a DREAM ... but, cliche of cliches ... it really wasn't a DREAM. <br /> <br />Don't waste your quarters on this junk.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|She may be marketed as a reggae crooner, but make no mistake, Miss Rihanna's specialty is high-energy dance-pop. First single \\"S.O.S.\\" combines an infectious hook with a brilliant Soft Cell sample, creating a pulsing club jam that is downright addictive. It is, undeniably, the best track here. It reuses the formula that made \\"Pon De Replay\\" so delectable, and is a more than welcome addition to her slew of singles. The rest of the album-just like her debut-isn't quite as exciting as the thunderous opener. Thankfully however, she's got a stronger set of songs this time around, and her growth as an artist does become apparent. \\"Unfaithful\\" was the second single, and thankfully this elegant pop ballad is more lush and satisfying than the dull, hokey \\"If It's Lovin' That You Want,\\" and for the first time we get a true example of Rihanna's vocal range. \\"We Ride\\" is a delicious dollop of poppy R&B with a luxurious chorus, and would make an excellent third single (this song would have the greatest commercial potential if she released it as a remix with some romantic rapped interplay featuring someone like LL Cool J). \\"Break It Off,\\" a juiced duet with Sean Paul that has already received some hip-hop airplay, is an infectious up-tempo tune, and though it has been released as the B-side of \\"S.O.S.,\\" it could have easily been a single on its own. Those four songs are the most enjoyable moments on the album. \\"Kisses Don't Lie\\" is a uniquely hooky blend of reggae and pop rock, while \\"The Final Goodbye\\" is something Michelle Branch might have sung. The \\"If It's Lovin' That You Want\\" remix is actually much better than the original-and as someone else said, the beat does resemble 50 Cent's \\"Candy Shop.\\" \\"Dem Haters,\\" \\"Selfish Girl\\" and \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" are pure reggae (and frankly they're all a tad disappointing-she's trying too hard to cater to both the pop and dancehall audiences, and it only works half the time). Like most R&B/pop divas' discs, there are far toomany ballads (which aren't exactly Rihanna's strongest suit), but the filler here does have a nice shimmer to it and works better than the just-plain-bad filler on her debut. The abundance of potential singles also helps, and the fact that she's more eagerly willing to tread R&B, pop and even lite rock waters makes the disc feel like the work of an artist who's more diverse, more capable than before. It's more than a little odd that she decided to release a sophomore disc not even a full year after her debut, but apparently it was the right decision, as it returned her to the top of the charts (she now has more than one really good song out) and has likely solidified her celeb status for the time being. Rihanna is definitely a singer to keep an eye out for in the future.
B000002UY3|5.0|Without a doubt, this is some of the smartest music to come from the nineties. Reviewers seem to throw around the term 'psychadelia' with heavy hands. Just a reminder that the Doors cooked blues, rock and folk with a dash of acid successfully (to those that know), and here we have a uniquely haunting clarion call in that same vein. Besides, as a love song joint you could do much, much worse.

B000002KHF|5.0|Let's cut to the chase. This is THE best Van Morrison album ever, IMHO. Several songs have received airplay and are reasonably well known (And It Stoned Me, Moondance). There are a bunch on here that are just as good. Crazy Love and Caravan are both immediately catchy. One of my favorites is Come Running, which I can listen to over and over and not get tired of. Probably the best song, one that sort of defines the whole mystical nature of the album, is \\"Into the Mystic\\"; just a great song. If you are wanting to buy one album of Van Morrison music that isn't just a greatest hits compilation, make it this on. You'll be glad you did.

B000EBEHR2|5.0|This album is discussed in detail below, so here is short and sweet.  Yes, the lyrics are not quite what they were on some of the earlier Placebo albums.  And there is much here that will remind you of several 80's and 90's bands.  But the songs are solid and remarkably memorable, and it hangs together quite well.  This is actually my favorite of all of the Placebo albums, and with each listen a different one becomes my favorite for the moment.  Definitely pick this one up.
B000A3VTT8|5.0|Having bought and seen this production on LaserDiscs several years ago, I was hoping against hope that a DVD of this production at La Scala would be issued. It would very difficult to find fault with any phase of this production. The direction/design by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle is outstanding and imaginative. The highlight of his magic for me occurs in the scene near the end of the opera when Cinderella is discovered by the Prince and all the characters are singing about this discovery and the effect it will have on them personally. Ponnelle puts the entire ensemble in silhouette and then spotlights each individual character to place focus on their reaction to the situation. At the end of this delightful scene you know what each individul is thinking about. I have never seen a stage technique that produces this kind of clarity when there is a literal cacophony of individuals in the ensemble singing many different vocal lines. <br /> <br />Now, shall we talk about Frederica von Stade? Perfect! She is a stunningly beautiful \\"Cenerentola\\". And her vocal handling of this rather difficult Rossini role can not be bettered by any living messo-soprano on the opera stage today. She owns the role with her interpretation, wonderful acting and a meltingly beautiful voice. I could not find a single flaw in either her interpretation or her beautifully controlled voice. <br /> <br />There is also much to be said about the remaing cast. Everyone played and sang their parts with beautiful vocal lines and simply outstanding Bel Canto technique. Araiza is a sensational singing actor in his role as the Prince. Montarsolo, as the make believe Prince had me laughing out loud. He is also another outstanding singing actor. And, I do not want to forget Claudio Abbado. His mastery of this music and ability to keep everything together, especially the duets, trios, quartets, and the very difficult places where every character is singing something different at the same time really has no peer. He allows the singers room to breathe and interpret their roles. Yet he keeps everone reigned in just enough so that the style and musicality of this playful opera is never compromised. <br /> <br />I obviously like this production of Cenerentola. I have watched/listened to my LaserDisc many times and always discovered something new and fresh that I hadn't observed previously. I can not wait to get my hands on the DVD!
B00005JL0I|4.0|First off, I read many reviews before spending $16 on a single DVD (I got the entire 4th season of MTM for $20), and none of them (NONE of them) got the plot right.  Well, what plot there was was minimal.  Didn't any of these people (including the Amazon staff reviewer) watch the damned thing?  Was it supposed to make sense?  I loved it after David Niven left Scotland, but found it a bore during those 30 endless minutes.  It was refreshing.  I think Woody Allen wrote his own dialogue.  Orson Welles was his usual pompous stuffed shirted self, and I disliked him in the pit of my stomach as usual.  It was a very unusual role for Deborah Kerr!  I recommend it for one viewing and I sure as hell wish I'd rented this instead of buying it.  Now what am I going to do with it?  The worthless security tape of the packaging (getting it off that is) ruined the plastic on the case as usual (dolts), so I can't even throw away the DVD and save the case.  For $16 (including shipping) I would have expected more from the studio than just a DVD stuck in a box.  No pamphlet, no leaflet listing scenes and tracks and extras, nothing.  Sigh I was disappointed, but it was full of colors and action and explosions and talented people and twists and imagination.  It reminded me of Neil Simon's two spoofs on detective stories, one called \\"Murder By Death.\\"  I forget the name of the other one.  I disliked them intensely.  But if you liked them, I think you'll go for this.  Read all the so-called reviews you want, it will still surprise you.  Because the reviews are all wrong.  The one thing all the reviewers got right is that the score was out of this world.
B0002S947K|3.0|Title song is why I bought the record. The rest of the tunes are just so-so.
B0000009SM|5.0|This, along with Roxy and Elsewhere and Bongo Fury, is the pinnacle of Zappa's career in my opinion.  Every track is memorable.  All three recordings are must haves for any Zappa fan.<br /><br />The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life was probably a better ensemble in the musical sense, but the lineup over the years that recorded One Size Fits All and the afore-mentioned recordings just had a magical chemistry.  George, Ruth, Napoleon, and Bruce were a big part of that chemistry.  However, Zappa disagreed that this was his best lineup ever.  I think the only group that ever came close to satisfying his crazed artistic vision was the Ensemble Modern.<br /><br />Just a note, the reviewer below who claims this was recorded while Zappa recovered from a broken leg has his chronology all wrong.  That incident occurred circa 1972 when Flo and Eddie were in the band.  The recordings made during the recovery were Waka Jawaka and The Grand Wazoo.  Just Another Band From LA (with Flo and Eddie) was also released in this period.  Get it right man!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is interesting to note that Firefly has been consistently in or near the top ten Amazon DVD sellers for over 2½ years.  As I write this it is #3 on the list.  Serenity is #4. <br /> <br />What does that mean? <br /> <br />It means that it was a terrific show and that there is a strong fan base to support new production.  Is anybody paying attention?  I hope so.
B00007GRCG|5.0|Well, I already owned a copy of Fever, but I'm a collector of Kylie. I think this was well worth the cost. The rare tracks, \\"Good Like That, Baby, Whenever You Feel Like It, and Tightrope,\\" are great, and I have no idea why they weren't included on the album, rather than the two tracks that I hate. And tho I'm NOT complaining, I don't understand why \\"Butterfly\\" was included, as its from Light Years. The remixes are also a plus, as its nice to get some variety and a new spin on the widely recognized \\"CGYOOMH.\\" (And its true, the slipcase actually says \\"ButterFRY,\\" not \\"ButterFLY.\\")
B000E8N690|5.0|This film from its onset is amazing from its attention to detail, the story itself from Johnny Cashes small beginnings to the legend he would become (& all that went with it) & of course the woman who was the love of his life an oscar winning performance by Reece Witherspoon. <br /> <br /> <br />However this film goes beyond its boundaries, the scenery, the heartache and the raw all inspring performance of Jauquin Phoenix who has come so far as an actor here makes this a stand alone film. <br /> <br />Excellent cast Dallas Roberts also gets his chance to shine the road to redemption through June for Cash and most of all the love between two people which made the last half hour of this film so moving. <br /> <br />Highly recommend and one of the finest and greatest films hollywood has made in years forget Brokeback Mountain and Crash this film has something else something that those two could give there back teeth for & though crually overlooked at the oscars. <br /> <br />This is one film worth going back to again and again and Jauquin Phoenix deserves an oscar just as much as Reese maybe someday!  Anyway terrific film on all counts and it perfectly summund up the era and the music. <br /> <br />It really is a jewal of a film & well worth buying the two disks for, to get the whole of the music!
B0000025DV|4.0|...but it is not for me the best ELO album. Perhaps, well I should say certainly, when it came out it was a peak for the ELO, since it was the album where they finally reached the arena audiences, and still keeping a very small bit of their prog-rock past (Eldorado). After that, Discovery came out, and then Xanadu, which ruined the reputation of ELO and Jeff Lynne in front of the musical critics, making the next effort, Time, to be enormously underrated. Sadly, for that one is for me the best ELO work and the hugest sound experimentation and change of all ELO history. <br />Well let's go back to Out of the Blue, and it is clear it is a good one. Many songs worth to be mentioned: Turn to stone is a very very good song, a terrific album opener, a song that any pop tunesmith must be envying forever. Sweet talking woman, pure joy of pop. Stepping out, very beautiful unmistakable Jeff melody. Standing in the rain, interesting musical experiment, with weird structure. Jungle, very funny thing. Sweet is the night, very very nice ballad. Wild West Hero: very good melody too. And from time to time very \\"urban\\" lyrics, that link good with us living in cities. <br />But the whole album lacks diversity a little bit: sometimes it feels like all the songs sound alike.  <br />In any case: a very good album, one of the best double LP efforts ever, and an obvious peak for ELO, that launched them to the biggest venues, which somewhat displeased Jeff Lynne and set the basis for the big changes to come for the band.
B0000640S2|1.0|HA HA HA.  Fooled you.  I actually LOVE this movie and I fricking love to be an American. This movie demonstrates why.  Guns, bombs, rocket laden helicopters, a hot Asian chick, and MORE GUNS!!!!!! What else do you need in this life? I almost wet myself when I saw this movie at the theater back in the 80s.  Rambo is the new archetype of MAN, the new mythological/pedagogical device meant to help us realize our  human potential. Come on, let's be honest, we've all been screwed by THE MAN.  We've all been sent on errands meant to fail just to make our superiors look competent.  We've all been abandoned under direct command. \\"And these are the people you protect.....with your pain.\\"  We're just grocery clerks sent to collect the bill (sorry, Apocalypse Now reference).  But do you think I'd care if I was left alone on a mountain top surrounded by a division of North Vietnamese armed with AK-47s all after my arse?!?!?!  Not on your life Baby!!!  At least, not since I saw this flick.  I know I'd still be able to take care of business provided I had a trusty sidearm, was sprayed with mildew, and had an emaciated countryman who'd been incarcerated into a stupor as a sidekick.  \\"You may scream.  There is no shame.\\"  No my friend. YOU!!! may scream, you Soviet tool, when Rambo rips you limb from limb in a fit of homicidal vengeance.  Don't bother with that touchy feely pap like Platoon, or Saving Private Ryan, or Schindler's list.  Any REAL man knows that this is what war's really about.  I can't recommend this movie enough. It will absolutely satisfy any lust you may have for ultraviolence.  God Bless.
B000FOQ0TG|3.0|The original VHS version was in MONO as well.  Why couldn't the company or the band insist on a STEREO track for VideoMindcrime.  The DVD portion is the reason to purchase this item, which I did on the day it was released.  I'm disappointed that the effort was not put into this release because this is one of my favorite records of all time.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and it comes highly recommended to watch it with your finger on PAUSE, as I couldn't go three minutes without laughing so loud I drowned the movie out. Everyone else I've had watch the movie since: same thing. Amazing casting and an interesting juxtaposition of the bi guy in the straight role with the straight guy in the gay role. So long as you're a native English-speaker you'll love it more, being as characters often speak over one another - in this way, and the way that the film's filled with character-based humor and not merely situational humor, it's every bit as funny as Office Space and The Big Lebowski, two gems for character-based humor. If your throat works to laugh and you're an 18+, not easily-offended person with both hemispheres in the green, give it a go. It'll make your cheeks sore laughing.
B000E6ESL2|1.0|I totally agree with Steve Mcintosh's review. Couldn't have said it better. A movie should not be rated as a great movie simply because of its visuals but rather it should be rated highly based on its synopsis and plot. One other thing - for all of you reviewers out there who write stay is a good movie and who recommend seeing it a second time you couldn't be more wrong. I would only watch a movie a second time if I really enjoyed watching it for the first time. Seeing a movie a second time to understand it better/more completly really suggests that the movie was a horrible piece of work whose audience cannot even follow in one round. This movie however, is not totally and utterly horrible - it is possible to sit through it (unlike other movies I've seen, namely, in the bedroom, closer and match point) if you really have the time and are curious.
0060537639|5.0|A hefty book, but definitely a good read.  There is a DVD by the same title that goes through the author's search for his information for the book. Very interesting as well, but more a \\"behind the scenes\\" look at the making of the book.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The director's cut of \\"Kingom of Heaven\\" solves most of the problems I had with the previous version. More than three hours long, the movie has gained \\"weight\\" that the story seemed to need. The characters are more developed and therefore much more interesting, like giving them an additional hour actually brought them back to the spotlight, while in the two hour version they seemed like, well, just some folks playing their parts between Big Battle Scenes. Balian used to be this ordinary blacksmith, who suddenly turned into a gifted strategist - here you get an explanation that is both convincing and so short, one wonders how come it was cut from the original version (the lead character was, in my opinion, it's weakest link, and when THAT doesn't work....). I'd still give the original a three and a half (it's  Ridley Scott allright - the film looks gorgeous), and this one gets an additional star. Not a masterpiece, but a whole lot closer.
0156027321|3.0|Let me tell you - PLEASE don't waste your time reading this. I started this book on May 3rd and finished it today (June 24th!). Most books take me a week to read...2 weeks maximum unless it's really long. But this book just didn't leap into my hands like other books do.  <br /> <br />\\"Life of Pi\\" is good for the first 150 pages or so...enough for me to be convinced that it's going to be a good book, but no. It takes a drastic turn for the worse. It slows way down and I really didn't have any motivation to pick it up and read it. There's not much action. The boy, Pi, is stuck on a lifeboat with a tiger for the majority of the book. This vast majority has a lot of philosophical stuff going on that is really quite boring. <br /> <br />On the plus side, it is very well-written, so if you're an English teacher or someone that's really into that hardcore literature (such as Hemingway) you'd probably like this book.  <br /> <br />The ending is actually pretty entertaining. If only the entire book was as good as the last 50 pages. Oh well...just my $0.02 on this book. <br /> <br />
B000F3A7LE|5.0|I first heard Robert Fripp when I bought David Bowie's Heroes.  To think of it, David Bowie was probably my gateway to many of the artists I listen to now, but back to the point.  I thought that his guitar playing was out of this world (almost fitting alongside Bowie), and when I bought Bowie's Scary Monsters, I became convinced that Fripp was the best guitar player I've ever heard.  Soon I became enthralled by Brian Eno (because of Bowie, U2, and Talking Heads), and I heard more of Fripp's amazing playing.  Then came King Crimson, and prog rock was cool again for me.  So when I heard that there would be a reissue of Fripp's Exposure, I knew that I would have to get it. <br /> <br />Exposure has had a tortured history, so reissuing it is only fitting to get a bigger picture of the album and its struggles and successes.  For the longest time, I thought that the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" or \\"Legacy Edition\\" series were the best reissues around, especially after the reissue of the Who's Who's Next, but they have a flaw that's apparent even in Elvis Costello's reissues: gluttony.  Bonus tracks are an amazing thing that usually illustrates the album-making process, but sometimes these reissues present a little too much information that almost makes the bonus tracks filler instead of insight. <br /> <br />With Exposure, the true skill of reissuing comes to the forefront.  The first disc is the original LP release; no frills, just the original presentation.  The second disc is the first CD release but with something new: three more Daryl Hall tracks, not to mention alternate takes after the album proper.  On the surface, it looks like it's just two discs of the same material, but dig deeper and there is more to grasp.  First, disc one has a slightly more muted feel that packs a lot of power and is more direct, while disc two has more reverb and sounds a little more atmospheric.  This is the first time that I hear two versions of the same album and and get two different feelings andinsights on each.  It's great to see a reissue pull that off finally. <br /> <br />The album itself is a classic collection of songs that works well as an album.  Each one flows into each other like they should, and to see both kinds of Frippertronics (Pure and Applied) in action on the same album without feeling disjointed or divided is great.  The softer songs act as perfect breathing room for the sonic assault over the entire album, and Fripp is in top form.  It's a different kind of rock album because Fripp doesn't sing; his autonomy is over the structure and arrangement of each song as well as providing some excellent guitar craft over each song.      Each voice feels at ease with Fripp, and this helps keep the continuity of the album.  No track is out of place, and no note is false.  It is the perfect balance between his work with Eno (the birth of Pure Frippertronics) and his contribution on Bowie's Heroes (the implementation of Applied Frippertronics). <br /> <br />Buy Exposure.  When you listen to this album, you'll understand what I mean what I say that it isn't \\"a hoax.\\"
0393061310|5.0|It is almost unnecessary, at this point, for me to review Guns, Germs & Steel by Jared Diamond. Diamond is a respected scientist and author, the book has already won a Pulitzer, and numerous helpful reviews are already available on this site. However, it is interesting that there have also been a number of negative reviews, especially from those with an anthropology agenda. My review is addressed to those budding anthropologists out there that might be persuaded by some of the reviews on this site not to read this book. <br /> <br />As I hope most practitioners are aware, anthropology is a discipline divided. There are those that approach the study of human history and cultures as a science, and there are those that study anthropology as a humanity. Diamond, an ecologist, only knows how to be a scientist. A scientist seeks the basic principles (i.e., processes) operating to produce a pattern. An hypothesis is made of the effect of a dependent variable upon an independent variable, and controlled experiments are run to test that hypothesis and its alternatives. As explained by the author, this is difficult when studying historical processes but not impossible. We must rely on natural experiments. For example, one can make the hypothesis that the direction of the axis of a continent had no effect, historically, on the dispersal of technology, especially regarding food production (the status quo, or null hypothesis, in this case). One can now compare the dispersal rate for Eurasia (East-West axis) to those for the Americas and Africa (N-S axis). From the available data, the null hypothesis is not supported, and it would seem that an E-W axis facilitated the dispersion of farming practices better than a N-S axis. Though the difference is subtle, the (superficially) described scientific approach is not the same as observing a pattern and then concocting a process scenario that fits. The latter approach is often more satisfying to non-scientists as it relies upon unambiguous authority: \\"The answer is THIS because SOMEONE who knows said so.\\" <br /> <br />That being said, Diamond does present his conclusions as \\"facts.\\" This is a popular book, after all, not a scientific article. I would expect that as evidence contrary to his hypothesis becomes available, Dr. Diamond will modify his present conclusions -- perhaps even abandon them outright. That is the nature of science, and one must be willing to accept that the best answer today, giving the data, may not be the best tomorrow. The best that we can do in any historical science is hypothesize that repeated patterns are the result of a common process. I found the arguments presented in Guns, Germs & Steel to be well-reasoned and consistent with the data presented. It took a skilled researcher and thinker like Jared Diamond to pull all this together, but his authority shouldn't matter a bit. Read it and think about the evolution of human societies for yourself. <br /> <br />Some of the reviewers have complained of a \\"liberal\\" agenda. Apparently, they subscribe to the hypothesis that certain races, because of intrinsic factors beyond skin color, facial features, etc., are/were better suited that others to develop civilization as we know it. Possibly. However, Diamond, through his analyses, demonstrated that extrinsic factors are sufficient to explain the observed differences in cultural development seen in societies around the world. While race may be a factor (are there any data?), it isn't a necessary one. <br /> <br />The claim has also been made that the ideas presented by Diamond are not completely original -- not that he plagiarized other authors, only that these ideas have been around for a while. That is always the nature of popular scientific literature; Guns, Germs & Steel won a Pulitzer, not a Nobel Prize. It is a well-written and entertaining discussion of those ideas about human cultural evolution. The cutting-edge seldom makes it to best-seller lists, or paperback for thatmatter. <br /> <br />The main criticism that I had of Guns, Germs & Steel was that is very repetitive. However, based upon some readers' reactions to the book, I can now see why Diamond had to beat his points into the ground. The historical processes behind human cultural evolution proposed are simple, but they are apparently controversial.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|Back in the year 2000, as we oohed and aahed at the spectacle of Ridley Scott's epic and were blown away by an ensemble of powerful performances from Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, and more, we never guessed that this film would so accurately prophesy the next six years.   <br /> <br />Indeed, a modern-day Commodus would steal the throne of an empire, neuter its Senate (and House of Representatives) and pander to an unwitting populace with an unending series of gladiatorial games (the war on terror).  George W. Commodus has all but assassinated his wiser, kinder, gentler father and eagerly disassembled many of his nobler works during a smirking, self-indulgent six-year reign. He has even survived the challenge of a popular former general (Wesley Clark) whom he did not have to stab in the back before their contest (the loyal opposition did it for him). The still-unanswered question is who will rise up as our Maximus to strike down the petulant boy-emperor and restore the dream that once was the United States of America?

B00006D295|5.0|What people really miss out on this film, in it's DVD format, is the thrill of seeing this with an audience at midnight in a theater.  This Grand-Daddy of a midnight still holds up.  Rocky Horror takes the Frankenstein story, turns it upside down and out, adds 50's horror movie camp, a liberal dosing of glam and pansexuality and some good old fashion rock and roll.  You can never capture magic like this again.

0786915749|5.0|This book is what introduced me to erading fantasy novels 8 years ago..The entier trilogy deserves 5 stars because of the rich detailed and lively characters,the epic quest these characters had to embark on,and how it changed them when it was over.. This book probably isnt the best in the series,but it was still one of the greatest story ever written..
B00005JO04|1.0|The trick in Syriana is the idea that people will a believe a portion of what ever someone says. They are the ones who say, \\"If only half the things in Syriana are true then US must be completely evil.\\" So a film maker who tells 100 lies knows that most people will believe 50 lies. <br /> <br />During the 1973 Arab oil boycott, there were no assassinations and the amount of oil coming to the US was unchanged.  The reason is the market is too strong to be controlled by nations. Therefore the idea that the US assassinates people for cheap oil is a lie. Oil companies may be evil but even they want high oil prices because that means they can charge more for oil.   <br /> <br /> <br />In 1776 Adam Smith thoroughly debunked the ideas found in Syriana. The use of force to secure raw materials or markets only impoverishes the country that uses force. That is why the USSR fell. Sure business can make money through the use of force but countries who use force for markets become weaker. Moreover as there are no US oil companies there is no reason for the US to help any oil company. The US wants to keep the oil flowing and the more it pays for oil the more oil will flow.  Therefore, the US tends to support high oil prices.   <br /> <br />OIL COMPANIES WANT OIL PRCES HIGH BECAUSE THEY SELL OIL <br /> <br />Only the rich liberals believe that the US uses force to keep oil prices low because don't consern themselves about gas prics.  Instead they sit in the back of their limousines while their chauffeurs pump gas.     <br />
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Give a good listen to this. Take in the poetic lyrics as well as the smooth, well-crafted guitar work of Knopfler and the soulful pleading voice of Emmylou Harris. It all adds up to a collection of outstanding songs that stay with you and aren't just throwaways. Impressively, for example, Knopfler plays while Harris sings wordlessly in \\"If This Is Goodbye,\\" one of the outstanding tracks here. True emotion is generated time after time as this album moves from track to track. Very strong work that deserves multiple listenings.

1572814349|5.0|The Golden Tarot is certainly the most beautiful of all the vailable Tarot decks. The author, Kat Black, has utilized the art of the late Middle Ages and early Rennaisance to put together a Tarot deck which reflects the familiar Rider-Waite <br />deck in content. The images and colors are of a very high standard. Ms. Black has exercised infinite patience and great taste in selecting the various art work for the cards. The accompanying booklet is succinct and comprehensible. I recommend this deck to the serious collector of Tarot decks as well as to the beginner. It is tops.

0895260131|5.0|This book does a good job of presenting the history of Islam as it coinsides with the history of the west ( Europe ). He also debunks <br />a lot of misinformation regarding the crusades. Especially the idea that the islamic world was just sitting there minding its own business as the evil forces of Christianity attack them. It is a book you can read a little, put it down, then come back to it later-- almost like a reference book. It is laid out in such a way that you could easily go back to find a certain point fairly easily. I would highly reccommend this book if you know almost nothing about Islam and its violent beginnings and beliefs.
B000093BDX|5.0|I enjoy EVERY minute of this CD! :)   Hit after hit, and memory after memory.

B000E97Y6K|4.0|It was a remake of the 1933 movie but a bit too long.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|Excellent overall.  It's just a shame that the \\"sulking scene\\" -- the scene where Kong, having been told by Anne that she's not going to be (literally) pushed around by him anymore and enough is enough, goes off to the edge of a cliff and sulks -- was edited out.  It's in the full-screen version but not here, so I can only think that the wide-screen version presented so much more digital data as to exceed the DVD capacity.  Something had to go, and this was it.  Too bad!

B00003JRCQ|5.0|I love this movie!  Amanda Root (forgive me for saying this) is a plainer and slightly older Anne than I had envisioned, but her acting is so wonderful, that we soon forget the physical discrepancy between the book and the movie. (Don't get me wrong, Amanda Root is in no way unattractive, but in the novel, Anne is constantly praised for her beauty/handsomeness, although at the \\"ripe old age\\" of 27, she is apparently past her \\"bloom.\\")  Ciarin Hinds played the jilted lover to perfection: he all but ignores Anne during the movie's early scenes and never betrays the feelings he tries fruitlessly to supress. He woos Louisa Musgrove as a ruse to deny his own feelings for Anne.  It isn't until Captain Wentworth observes how fatigued Anne is during a long walk with his friends and acquaintances, that we see his concern for Anne's welfare is still intact. Anne is very touched by this gesture of Captain Wentworth in securing her a space on his sister and brother-in-law's carriage where there is room for only one lady.<br /><br />Anne and the nouveau riche captain are given another chance at love, despite interferring friends and dubious circumstances. Anne's cousin, Mr. Elliot, suddenly feels the lure of social respectability.  I don't think the screenwriter needed to change Mr. Elliot's financial circumstances in order to make him appear more odious to the audience.  In the book, Mr. Elliot had more than enough money, but he thought marrying Anne would bring about the appearance of social respectability. He unsuccessfully tries to woo her (\\"Really Mr. Elliot, this is too much flattery\\").  It is too bad he didn't set his sights on Elizabeth Elliot, as they seem cut from the same fabric.  Captain Wentworth misinterprets Anne's feelings for her cousin (thank God we don't marry our cousins anymore!).  However, in one of movie history's most beautiful scenes, Captain Wentworth subtly gestures to Anne that he has written her a letter. I cry every time I watch Anne read about Wentworth's true feelings for her and how he could never forget her, try as he may.<br /><br />One part of the movie that I didn't quite like was the portrayal of Lady Russell. Yes, she was officious and misguided, but she was like a second mother to Anne (in the book).  In the movie, she is practically demonized as an unrepentant social snob, whom Wentworth \\"will find difficult to forgive.\\"  In the book, Wentworth and Lady Russell are reconciled, and she recognizes the error of her judgment and short-sightedness. She did try to act in Anne's best interest, but like our charming and irrepressible Emma, ended up being completely in the wrong regarding matters of the heart and matchmaking.<br /><br />I loved the soprano (Rosa Mannion) who sang during one of the concerts in Bath. What a voice! I'd love to hear more from this singer.'s true feelings for her and how he could never forget her, try as he may.

B0000TLA9G|5.0|Wow!!! This is one of the greatest albums ever to come out in history by one of the greatest bands of all time, Guns N' Roses. <br />If you don't like it then you are an idiot. Led Zeppelin, Beatles, Stones, and Pink Floyd suck. Listen.  <br /> <br />PS. November Rain is one of the greatest songs in history!
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I don't own this CD, but have listened to it numerous times, as one of my old roommates has it. In the past year, I have become an avid Beatles fan, much as I was in my younger years (I don't want to give the wrong impression: I'm only 24-years old, but grew up with the Beatles, thanks to my mom!), I suppose. I haven't quite finished my collection of Beatles albums yet, but, thus far, I have Please Please Me, Help, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Magical Mystery Tour, The White Album, Abbey Road, and Let it Be. The Beatles were a force in the history of music, and their influence is still felt today. Their career was quite short, but the plethora of music they released to the public was incredibly immense; and the evolution their sound took on between their first and final recordings is amazing, when the short duration of their life as a band is taken into context. <br />My beef with this album, though, is not that there are bad songs; it is very hard to find a bad Beatles song (a few exist here and there, mind you). The problem that I have is the exclusion of any song from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and The White Album. Now, I wasn't alive in the 60s, and I don't look at Billboard Chart Archives, so I suppose that no song from those two albums reached the #1 spot on said charts. I would find that hard to believe, at least with Sgt. Pepper's, as I know it was the first rock album to receive the Grammy for \\"Album of the Year.\\" I'm just surprised to not find Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds or While My Guitar Gently Weeps, as a bare minimum, on this album... <br />Alas, as I stated above, every song on this album is definitely a keeper. I just find it hard that two of their top selling albums aren't represented on a collection boasting the \\"#1\\" hits at all... Other than that, this album is a great listen!

0553801503|2.0|THE GOOD:  Martin is a talented and fantastic writer.  To date, I don't know anyone who fleshes out worlds and characters better.  He has created a place as real as our own world in his \\"Fire and Ice\\" series and has done a wonderful job maintaining its believablity.    THE BAD:  Sometimes too many characters dilute from the plotline - or subplotlines of which there are many.  If you are not paying close attention, you may get lost as to who is doing what.  Especially with this book.  There are a lot of new characters and some old favorites are absent.  It made for some frustrated nights flipping through pages looking for a character I was interested in.    THE UGLY:  EDIT PLEASE!  For the love of God, this book could have been editted and added to the next book.  I believe chapters in a book should contribute to the overall story and there were many, many times I completed a chapter and wondered why it was in the book.  Yes I understand the concept of immersive writing but this was near the point of ridiculous.  I felt Martin just threw his fans a bone with this book because he knew the first three had em hooked.  Unfair.  Unfair to us all.    Ubermonkey says ask a friend what happened and don't waste your time pouring through the drudgery of this episode.

B000ETQRCM|4.0|These LL Cool J lyrics could easily be used to describe Pearl Jam's terrific new album that shows that they are, indeed, impossible to knock out, no matter what Mama said when you first played your \\"10\\" CD (or album, if you're a true Eddie Vedder devotee) too loud 15(!) years ago. <br />It is puzzling that Pearl Jam hasn't sold albums like they did in the 90s, but even more puzzling is the fact that some people think they've disappeared.  Baloney.  Rather, PJ has gone on to make music that they consider important and worthwhile, and have never been one to seek the limelight.  Their last album, \\"Riot Act\\", is at least as good as \\"VS\\" but didn't sell nearly as well.  True, \\"Binaural\\" seems a bit odd, but such is the course of the Pearl Jam lifeline. Meanwhile, PJs cult status among rock fans make them truly unique.  At the show I saw in Cleveland, Quicken Arena was sold out, no one sat down during the 2.5 hour show, and most people knew nearly every word of every song, no matter how obscure.  <br />This new disc, however, is anything but obscure, and packs a real and immediate wallop. Irresistible hooks, diverse and intoxicating guitar, bass and drum work...all neatly wrapped inside one of rock's best voices since Jim Morrison, but with lyrics that are better than anything Morrison could ever muster, despite the myths and hype. <br />There are almost no weak spots on the album, but there are some true rock masterpieces here.  \\"Comatose\\" is a hard rock gem that will wake anyone up.  The simple guitar hooks and Vedder's wail put the listener in a chokehold and don't let up for three minutes...the way a good punk rock song should.  <br />Vedder's \\"World Wide Suicide\\" is good, but not nearly as impressive as \\"Unemployable\\", a delicious piece of pop that seems to take a page out of the Police blotter, circa 1981.  I kept picturing Sting singing this as I listened.  <br />After the hard-rock explosion of the first half, Vedder and Gossard weigh in with \\"Parachutes\\", a folky, country-twinged song with an irresitible acoustic bop-bop. <br />Pearl Jam fans argue ferociously about what album is best.  To me, nothing beats 1997's \\"Yield\\".  But this album is so accessible, yet so smart and engaging, that I am indeed knocked out.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|Excellent movie about life and it's problems.  I was very surprised.

B000EULJLU|4.0|I love TOOL's music. They're one of the best bands I've been privileged to listen to and I've absolutely loved all their past works. However, this album falls short of their normal brilliance. I've tried to love it, I really have, but it lacks the uniqueness and diversity of their past album. The first track is great, but slowly you find yourself listening to what sounds like the same song for the rest of the whole CD. Their is little variety or inspiration between the tracks. Overall, it's a good CD but compare to their past CDs, its okay at best.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|This is a great album by Fleetwood Mac and my favorite song is Goodbye Baby, it really is a great song. But this album could have been WAY better if some songs werent included. Those being, Smile At You, Say Goodbye, Destiny Rules, Whats the World Coming To, Murrow Turning Over In His Grave, Illume (9/11) and Red Rover. That would bring it to 10 songs without what I think is filler.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I came to the party late. I heard some very good reviews for the movie \\"Serenity\\", so I watched it.  There were just a few things I didn't get at first:  Why are they swearing in Chinese? What's \\"gorram\\" and \\"shiny\\"?  it didn't matter, I still really liked the movie.  So I rented the series at the local video store.  I was hooked. With a big barbed hook. I couldn't believe this show was canceled.  How on earth can \\"reality\\" shows exist while a show as well thought out and written as \\"Firefly\\" gets canceled?  I loaned my box set to a friend and she's not giving it back. I went (almost) a week without the set on my shelf. Just the thought of Mal and the crew being gone was too much for me. I ordered another set.  It arrived today and already I'm breathing easier.  I still recommend getting the set and loaning it out to your friends. They will get hooked just like everyone else.    I have heard there are 2 kinds of people, Those who love Firefly and those who have never heard of it.    If you're looking for characters you will instantly love, honest, sharp dialog and pretty decent special effects, look no further.  \\"Firefly\\" will take care of you.  Complete the story with the movie \\"Serenity\\". It ties up some loose ends but leaves the door and the story lines wide open for more.  This show had so much to offer.  The rumors are circulating about a sequel to the movie. BUY - CONVERT - REPEAT  For the sake of the 'verse, make it happen.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|The plot here involves a 6 century old war between vampires and werewolves (called lycans). As this is modern times, they use modern weapons to kill each other. There have been countless movies about vampires and/or werewolves but this manages to offer a fresh take and not just rehash old stories. <br />The star of the movie is Kate Beckinsale and she is just great in the lead role. Having seen her before in romantic comedy type parts (\\"Serendipity\\"), it's a pleasant surprise that she (and her stunt people) are so good in a straight action part. Fans of action movies will enjoy this movie.

I'm sure the director Pitof would like to know.<br /><br />Positives: Halle Berry has one of the prettiest faces and figures in film today. You'll probably watch the movie from beginning to end for that reason alone. Benjamin Bratt is terrific as Tom Lone, police detective and love interest to Patience \\"Catwoman\\" Phillips and Frances Conroy (Ophelia) provides some much needed depth and occult mystery to the plot as the historian and guardian of the Egyptian Goddess Baast and the \\"Secret Society of Catwoman.\\"<br /><br />Negatives: Sub-par special effects, silly plot and a little too much S&M motif in the choice of costume for my taste.

But then, I felt the same about \\"Traffic.\\"  I certainly admire the project's ambituousness--like the war on drugs, there is no easy answer to global terrorism and energy dependence, though the project doesn't mention beheadings such as the one of Nicholas Berg at the hands of al-Zarqawi in its plot about the assassinated Saudi idealist, played magnificently by Alexander Siddig with marvelous understatement and texture.<br /><br />Siddig's role as Dr. Julian Bashir of \\"Star Trek\\" fame was not a stereotypical Arab role (the character was originally called Julian Amoros), but he seems to get the terrorist roles (Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in THE HAMBURG CELL, a guest shot in \\"MI5:Spooks\\") as well as the idealistic ruler roles such as Feisal opposite Ralph Fiennes (where, as in \\"Hamburg Cell\\" Sid puts on a convincing Arab accent instead of his marvelous British) in \\"A Dangerous Man,\\" where Feisal got torpedoed by the West--in this case, the Brits and the French, forcing \\"dangerous man\\" TE Lawrence (Fiennes) to turn against his colleagues the way Clooney's Baer and Matt Damon's cynical economics expert do.<br /><br />Prince Nasir is a blending of Feisal and Bashir, both idealists.  My movie date and I agreed Alexander Siddig's was the best performance--with apologies to George Clooney, who convincingly did a Charlize Theron and shed his glam image, and whose torture scenes as well as the famous \\"Why am I being investigated\\" scene, not to mention the moment where he looks at Nasir just before Nasir buys it courtesy of Big Oil and the CIA, are excellent.  In a cast this stellar, with everyone brilliant  right down to Amanda Peet, who does drama brilliantly, it's hard to pick a standout--Jeffrey Wright is good, though his scenes with his father seem to go nowhere plotwise (although they're touching and maybe meant to humanize this lobbyist), and Chris Cooper and Christopher Plummer excellent.<br /><br />As for the film's assertion of American assaination and manipulation of political affairs, we all know it happens (Siddig once played scenes with William Sadler in \\"Star Trek\\" where the latter guest-starred as a Baer-like spy with no conscience--Sadler made an unreleased film called \\"Purple Heart\\" involving a US Military plot to kill Saddam Hussein). Yes, it bothers any thinking person. The other side of the coin is that covert ops have saved countless lives (and in the first gulf War, people argued we should have taken out Hussein.)  It's more troubling when the target is presented as a good guy, like Nasir, which is most likely the point.  It's worth remembering we trusted Hussein and bin Laden once upon a time.  Syriana tries to make us think about the complex sides of the issues--while people may debate Clooney's politics, he and Steven Spielberg certainly tried to move moviegoers.<br />As for the film's assertion of American assaination and manipulation of political affairs, we all know it happens (Siddig once played scenes with William Sadler in \\"Star Trek\\" where the latter guest-starred as a Baer-like spy with no conscience--Sadler made an unreleased film called \\"Purple Heart\\" involving a US Military plot to kill Saddam Hussein).

B000FGGE68|3.0|'Ultraviolet' is the most recent arrival from an evergrowing number of films with plots dealing with beautiful and deadly warrior women in sexy skin tight costumes fighting injustice. Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil) is back once again doing what she does best, terminate evil.<br /><br />Set far into the future, after most of mankind has been wiped out by a devastating biological holocaust those that remain have been divided into two warring camps, humans and hemophages. The hemophages are comprised of humans who have been infected by a virius that bestows vampire-like physical attributes and physical abilities, but also accelerates the aging process. Ultraviolet is the most deadly hemophage assassin who has been sent on a mission that will change the balance of power forever if successful. That is if she decides to complete the assignment as originally planned.<br /><br />Yes the storyline does lack substance but there is so much non-stop action in this film there really isn't much room between fight scenes to fit one in. The special effects are definitely not the best I've ever seen, but passable. As for Milla, she says it herself, \\"I'm a Titan, a monolith. Nothing can stop me.\\" She's absolutely right!

B0002RGNRU|4.0|The ending of this movie took me by surprise emotionally.  After a minute, I turned off the TV and started to close the windows before going to bed, but there was some quiet music coming from somewhere that I paused to listen to.  It wasn't anything like music you normally hear, but a pretty and perhaps improvised melody being played very professionally on a violin, with deeper accompanying tones that sounded like someone blowing into a jug.  I couldn't tell where it was coming from, but the musicians might have seen me standing in the window because they suddenly stopped.<br /><br />This felt slightly unreal coming immediately after the movie, which itself was very dream-like in the way time was all mixed up, along with different levels of reality.  Most of the movie consists not of a flashback but rather wanders back and forth in time, while sensitive, introverted Joel (Jim Carrey) is having his memories of a short-lived romance with beautiful, outgoing, and impetuous Clementine (Kate Winslet)  surgically  removed.  But the memories keep getting mixed up with or distorted by the reality of the present, which is that Joel is having doubts or second thoughts about this procedure, which is presented in a surreal way as a house call performed in Joel's apartment by an inept assistant, while Joel lies unconscious with a contraption on his head, and the assistant simultaneously monitors a laptop computer doing the erasing and parties with his girlfriend (Kirsten Dunst, who shows off her outstanding figure by dancing in her underwear).  Of course, is this supposed to be what's really going on or has the procedure already taken place and this is Joel's dreaming interpretation of what happened?<br /><br />One of the most common types of love story involves some sort of separation or barrier between the would-be lovers, and this script finds an ingenious way to create that kind of longing or desire.  Even though the viewer already knows that the relationship has ended, the tension comes from Joel's fight to hang on to his memories of Clementine, if not the real person.  I'm a little slow sometimes, and I wasn't quite sure at the end whether they had actually reunited and reconciled in some sense, or whether this was again just something being worked out in Joel's mind.  This is probably one of those movies where any attempt to present a narrative of the story just sounds nonsensical, but the point is the overall tone and feeling of it, which was sort of like a song that moves you even when you don't hear all the words clearly.  The reason why the ending was so effective, I think, was that it makes you realize that life and love are really like this.  We're sometimes so quick to delete people from our lives, and if a relationship isn't working out, it's tempting to just give up and erase the feelings we once had for this person from our memory.  Like the \\"medical technicians\\" in the movie who aren't portrayed as sinister figures but just distracted and disengaged, we ourselves don't consciously choose to do this out of cruelty, and yet this is what we do anyway.  Maybe it's a necessary part of moving on and eventually finding someone new, but it's sad nevertheless., the tension comes from Joel's fight to hang on to his memories of Clementine, if not the real person.

0312995423|2.0|I have to agree with the first reviewer. I, like many, became introduced to Dan Brown with the DaVinci Code... and having read that I decided to work backwards through his novels. While I do feel that Brown essentially writes the same book over and over (same outline, same character construction) he usually manages to make it interesting.<br /><br />This book could have been, but it is so utterly predicable that I could have stopped half way through (and mentally did) and finish it. I only kept reading it with the hope that he would fool me - he didn't. I knew the password for the elevator long before it was divulged, knew who the \\"bad guy\\" was from about chapter three, knew the \\"unlock code\\" as soon as the first hint was given - something that took the NSA characters another five or six tedious pages to figure out.<br /><br />Brown turns his intelligent characters into drooling idiots in this novel. Give this one a pass. Enjoy his other works.
0345440900|2.0|I found this an unpleasant book. Tracy Hogg is hard on new mothers. She spends a lot of time telling you it is okay to feel completely incompetent and hopelessly overmatched by your new baby -- but that *she* knows exactly what to do. And then she goes on to explain in great detail all of the things you are probably doing wrong, so if you weren't feeling incompetent to start with, you will be by the time you finish this book.<br /><br />I agree with many of the other reviewers who have problems with particular pieces of advice offered by Tracy Hogg. A lot of it does seem to contradict -- respond to your baby's cues, but don't feed on demand, for example. But mostly I disliked the constant drumbeat of stories and examples where selfish or foolish mothers (and sometimes fathers) had not understood what was best for their babies until Ms. Hogg came along to straighten them out.<br /><br />For example, consider the advice on toys and playtime. The heading for the section is \\"Too many playthings/Too much stimulation.\\" Hogg starts the section by telling us what is WRONG with the way most parents play with their kids -- they either \\"minimize the importance of Baby's play, not realizing that a gread deal of learning is taking place,... or they go completely bonkers and are in their infant's face all the time, cajoling, showing toys, shaking things. Neither extreme is good.\\"<br /><br />I agree, avoid extremes with your baby, and include some advice to that end somewhere in the chapter. But maybe START the section on play with a little positive support. Most parents and infants enjoy the time they spend together -- it's the payoff after all the work. But instead of a gentle discussion of what is appropriate at what ages -- from one week to a year -- we get several pages of lecturing. We overstimulate. We give the babies too many toys. Too many of the toys are electronic and jiggle or play music. Our babies, explains Ms. Hogg, are still traumatized from the birth experience and then \\"here's Mum or Dad in your fase, asking you to play. It's enought to make an Angel baby cry.\\"<br /><br />I read the book when my son was almost eleven months old -- so very little actually applied to me. But I am so glad I did not read it when my son was a newborn. I would have felt awful and learned almost nothing.  \\"I never leave a screaming baby.\\" she assures, but on the other hand goes on to say \\"I don't advocate holding or comforting a baby once you have met his need. The minute he is calm, put him down. Thus you give him the gift of independence.\\" Codswallop -- to use one of Ms. Hogg's favorite terms. Imagine trying to make a new mother feel guilty because she doesn't put her baby down fast enough! If you feel like holding your baby, hold him. If you want to put him down, put him down. If your baby is content, there is no \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" here. The \\"gift of independence\\" will come when your child is ready -- whether or not the poor kid suffered through an extra couple of \\"uneccessary\\" cuddles.<br /><br />On the other hand, a book I was very glad I read before bringing my baby home was \\"The Happiest Baby on the Block\\" by Harvey Karp. \\"Happiest Baby\\" is full of concrete suggestions for soothing a baby -- things I am very glad I knew before I brought my son home. We started using them in the hospital.<br /><br />For general baby advice I liked Sears' book much better. Yes, he is also opinionated, and much of what he says has to be adapted to one's own circumstances. But he stresses over and over that parents should TRUST their own instincts first.ence and then \\"here's Mum or Dad in your fase, asking you to play.

0446677450|1.0|The first 90 pages of this book gives solid philosophies about money such as knowing the difference between assets and liabilities and using your money to acquire assets.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the second half of the book contains terrible, unrealistic advice and sounds like a typical real estate investment scaminar pitch. He recommends flipping real estate as a way of getting rich citing numerous personal experiences. (He brags about once making $40,000 in just 5 hours of work.)<br /><br />He recommends inventing something as a great way to get rich. The example he gives is Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone. Thanks, I'll get right on that.<br /><br />He writes about how his personal stock investments are high risk small stocks that have sometimes grown from \\"$25,000 to a million in less than a year\\". Mutual funds are too \\"safe\\" and his advice is to take on lots of risk to make money.<br /><br />He buys tax lien certificates and the \\"lowest yield I look for is 16%\\".

0486440915|4.0|This edition has a nice binding and the illustrations are charming.  However, the margins and type are both too large and the result is a 476 page book which is awkward to hold.

B000005RT8|4.0|I've said as much before, and will again...Paul McCartney needs a sarcastic partner, a sick spouse, or some kind of tragic mayhem in his life to kick him in creative gear (once it was hearing the Beach Boys \\"Pet Sounds\\" at a time when he knew the Beatles were getting lazy).  The crisis for the fine work considered here was provided by Japanese Customs, which the future Knight Bachelor foolishly put in the uncomfortable position of finding a great big bag of pot at the top of his suitcase (his suitcase, mind you, not a roadie's, or a manager's, or hidden in someone's shoe).  Thankfully, brain cells used for music making are not necessarily those used for common sense.  But lodged in a cell in  care of Tokyo's Finest for a few days, Our Hero, who had already begun some experimental tapes that were the basis of this album, had time to ponder even further on it(one addition, of course, being \\"Frozen Jap\\", not the most politically correct reference to his hosts, but a catchy tune).<br /><br />McCartney is fairly open in saying that his writing goes along two tracks.  One is the more populist track, that which buys his bread and butter (as if he needs a lot of that by now); the other is \\"just for me.\\"  At least at that time, he kept tapes in his home studio, thinking he might put an album together some time, knowing it might not sell as well as the others, but just seeing how far it would go.  The only real commercial song on this album is \\"Coming Up\\", which did become something of a hit, complete with a video featuring Paul in a Beatles' outfit (the first he'd ventured back in time since the Beatles' days.) The other songs play around with tape tempo, ways of recording voice, in some of the ways the Beatles had done with George Martin at EMI, although in a much smaller way:  this was made on a 16 track tape machine at home.  Talk about low tech!<br /><br />I think the best two songs on the album are \\"Summer's Day Song\\", which sounds like a Tangerine Dream-like madrigal, overlain with simple harmonies--McCartney has layered his and Linda's voices over and over so that it eventually sounds like a choir--and \\"Bogey Music\\", which he wrote at the behest of his kids regarding one of the family's favorite books.  (When this album came out, designer Stella would have been 9 years old; photographer Mary 10; James Louis, who is featured in one of mom's photograph's that accompany the album would have clocked in at 3 years. Heather, 16, probably was too old for Bogeys; she was much more interested in boyfriend Billy Idol).  \\"Bogey Music\\"  features Paul's voice muffled from the mike a la \\"Honey Pie\\" or \\"When I'm 64\\" but in a gruffer mode, and accompanied by a synthesizer that cooks up a mighty fine brass section.<br /><br />McCartney II is not a masterpiece, but it is a fun, interesting and smart recording, one that doesn't try to be something it's not.  It's just pure Paul.igal, overlain with simple harmonies--McCartney has layered his and Linda's voices over and over so that it eventually sounds like a choir--and \\"Bogey Music\\", which he wrote at the behest of his kids regarding one of the family's favorite books.

B00005JNRY|3.0|I have to admit.  I was really looking forward to this movie.  I mean really.  The teaser that had been playing for almost two years during previous visits to the theater with my 3 kids left me giddy with excitement.  Okay, yes, I acknowledge that I am strange, yet I am not alone, I assure you of that.  Like millions of others, I have come to expect from Pixar Films intelligent, witty, and charming productions that serve up as many laughs (if not more) for adults as for their diminutive counterparts.  I mean, it's to the point where I am more excited to go to the films my eleven-year-old is now beginning to outgrow.<br /><br />So, I was looking forward to \\"Cars\\" and perhaps my expectations were too high.  While it was charming and sweet in a safe sort of way, the film just lacks the spunk and general pizzazz that we have come to expect from the people who brought us \\"Toy Story\\", \\"A Bug's Life\\", \\"Finding Nemo\\", and \\"The Incredibles\\".  Lacking in cultural allusions, innuendo, and similar word play, the film is just okay.  Perhaps the fact that the main writing of the screenplay is credited to three writers with virtually nothing under their belts is an indication of why this venture lacks the expected luster of a Pixar movie.<br /><br />And yet...some questions I need to ask myself...<br /><br />Is it fun and appropriate for its target audience?  Yes.<br /><br />Does it have a nicely wrapped-up moral that is delivered well, but not too heavily?  Sure.<br /><br />Are the visuals bright and fun to look at for about an hour and a half?  Absolutely.<br /><br />So, was it torture to sit and watch it with my kids?  No.<br /><br />Most importantly, my kids liked it and it still beats \\"Baby Geniuses\\" by a long shot. And yet, it is with more reservation that I will walk into a Pixar film in the future...although I will admit that the teaser for \\"Ratatouille\\" looks great!

B00005MP58|5.0|I very much disagree with the reviewer down below. What did you mean about taking God's name in vain? I'm a religious person and there was certainly nothing blasphemous here. As to not being romantic enough, personal tastes differ and I for one preferred the restrained passion here since it made it much more romantic IMHO. The length helps deepen the characters and the plot and I for one am grateful for it. I'm sorry Barlow but I watched this after seeing your review and I thoroughly disagree.
B000059PPN|4.0|would it make me a super bore to say that i actually enjoy this movie? i mean, sure, the beyond and zombie are definately better in re-watchable terms, but this..this is just a really cool..sometimes even funny movie..i mean the kid, Bob, has one of the funniest overdub voices i have heard and it kept me laughing for a lot of parts that dragged on..this movie would be an easy mystery science theater 3000 masterpiece since it tends to try and take itself seriously, but comes off as something totally different/funny. also, i can think of many instances to where this movie seemed like the shining...couple and a little boy relocate for time period, illusions of blood, telepathic communication between the little boy and the little girl, axe through the door, etc etc. <br /> <br />anyways, i like this film, if anything, it could have used more spook factor such as the beyond had done.  <br /> <br />if you want to try your luck with bad fulci movies, i would say watch \\"city of the living dead\\"...tisk tisk such a good name for a bad film. <br /> <br />
630428540X|5.0|An extraordinary drama, Phenomenon, brings to the screen the story of a man who suddenly undergoes a major mental transformation allowing him to make use of abilities he never thought he had.  <br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.   <br />John Travolta, Kyra Sedgwick, Robert Duval, Forest Whitaker, Brent Spiner (!) and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!  <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!  <br />In short, Phenomenon is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! 4 1/2 Stars <br />

630512762X|5.0|Let's just get it out there--this movie has a glaring hole in its premise.  Switching faces doesn't mean a hill a beans when two men have glaringly different body types/voices and mannerism.  All that aside this is one heck of a thrilling ride.  John Travolta literally looks like a kid in a candy shop in this role while hamming it up for camera.  And as for the woman playing his wife- c'mon.  Was that changed, too?  Plus, why did it seem that the FBI agent left for work one day (to change his face)-get stuck in prision and his wife not even miss him?  He just showed up back home with no questions asked.  Weird.  Again, these small questions are just minor bumps in the road because you can't help but be rivited to the screen.  Especially through my favorite scene with 'Somewhere over the rainbow' and the over the top shoot out.  Excellent filmmaking.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|The acting is very good in this movie as the actors are very good in their parts. Edward Norton does a great job as he plays a sleazy traitor who kills several people. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron do equally great jobs in their roles as they are very emotional and do a very convincing job. The rest of the supporting actors do a great job as thieves who all have their own personality. The short performance by Donald Sutherland was very good and believable.  <br />
B00005JNJV|5.0|It wasn't always the case that a comic book adaptation could draw Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman. Fortunately, comic movies are \\"in\\" right now. And, more fortunately still, they made this movie while they could. <br /> <br />This is the Batman movie we've all always waited for. Now, don't get me wrong: Burton's Batman was a lot of fun, and Schumacher's slightly less so, but still enjoyable in a way. But they never really captured the feel of Batman or the depth of the mythology. They concentrated too much on the gadgets and the costuming, and not enough on the people behind them. <br /> <br />This movie is about Bruce Wayne, and how and why he decides to dress up like a gigantic bat and fight against the scum of the earth, when he *could* be living it up as a billionaire playboy. Sure, we all know that his parents were killed and that this is his \\"motivation\\" but it goes deeper than that. This film shows us this. <br /> <br />It sets Batman up against two of his famous nemeses--Ra's al Ghul and the Scarecrow (and shows a third, Mr. Zsasz, who doesn't feature prominently)--as he also tries to work out his personal relationships and assume the Wayne family mantle. <br /> <br />This movie is a treat, exciting from start to finish, and is maybe the best comics \\"origin\\" film that we have thus far. The sequel is already slated (for 2008) and hopefully it will continue the strong quality established here.

B00005JMEW|4.0|Quentin Tarantino is back. Back in the director's seat where he most assuredly belongs, away from ill-advised forays into the acting arena, and he has thankfully has returned, quite literally, with a vengeance. Kill Bill: Vol.1 (Volume 2 to be released on April 16th) is predicated on the formulaic ruse of any 1970's Hong Kong kung-fu film worth its P's & Q's--sweet, sweet, blood trenched revenge. And just for good measure, Tarantino artfully glommed onto the latest Japanese Anime craze and produced a movie worthy of his name and reputation.
B00009V7P8|4.0|This CD is enjoyable for all those love-sick, tortured souls out there.

I am personally very happy with the purchase.

B00001QGPR|3.0|David Bowie's music is always one of two categories: Brilliant or terrible. Nothing's okay. Nothing's just good. Nothing's just bad. It's one extreme or the other, because his music is so diverse and he takes risks. David Bowie is very famous for his ability to take pop culture trends and turn them into something very distinctly his own. Most of it's brilliant, and that what keeps us around.    This is the first Bowie album I've ever heard that is just average. Not bad, not good. On the positive side, there are no bad songs. Every one of the songs ranges from okay to very good. New Angels of Promise and Thursday's Child are very good. The Pretty Things Are Going To Hell even borders on great. The negative side is that most of the songs are just okay, and none of the songs are brilliant.    When did Bowie's music get so sad? Bowie always wrote some sad songs, but he also wrote happy songs and most of the songs are really neither. This album is so downbeat at some points that it's kind of painful. I appreciate sad music, but as far as that's concerned, I kind of prefer a mixed bag. Bowie seemed really unhappy when he wrote the album.    The songs are mostly softer, except The Pretty Things Are Going To Hell, which is sounds kind of like a mid-90s alternative rock song. The songs kind of melt into each other, which is kind of weird. A lot of the song's sound alike, which is unusual for Bowie, who generally avoids that. His vocals are very good. Even better than usual, actually.    Had it been any other performer, it would be a very good album. It is emotional, the vocals are good and there are some good songs on it. But as a Bowie album, it is only decent. It is worth a listen, but it's certainly not his best.

B00004RFCM|5.0|It's the first time when Sex and the City came out on a DVD, the first season. I didn't get into Sex and the City when it was on T.V. Maybe because I didn't have enough time to watch it. But when it came out, I decided to buy and fell in love with it. I can watch those episodes over and over again. Those are just lives of ordinary young women who face the same problems we do. It's interesting to watch and learn something from them. <br />

B00004Z4WQ|3.0|It's a funny movie, though funny-stupid. It's the parody of couple of the movies, which makes it even more interesting and funny. \\"I know what you did last summer\\", \\"Scream\\", and \\"The Matrix\\" are couple of the movies that you might recognize while watcing Scary movie. It's dumb, but it's funny. You don't have to think a lot while watchig it. Fun to watch with a group of people.
0440241588|5.0|A political thriller about a powerful Washington, DC broker who receives a full pardon by a President in his very last hour in office. The book is very engrossing and I couldn't put it down. Apparently I am not the only one as almost every person who walked by my desk and saw the book had comments on how much they loved reading it. Although this book is fiction I believe this book contains many hard truths about politics. Our society is all about personal gain and not taking any responsibility for our own actions.  What I call the \\"Me, Me, Me\\" society. How sad.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I am very sick of everyone saying that Green Day isnt how they used to be and they suck and they sold out. they didnt sell out at all, theyre just growing up and trying to steer away from being repetitive. Why do you want them to release another Dookie? theres one, thats enough. This album reflects a tremendous amount of effort lyrically and musically all following a general concept and ''Jesus of Suburbia'' is a very well put together song, I absolutely cannot understand how people are writing reviews on how terrible it is. Not to mention, their punk side is still reflected on songs like \\"Letterbomb\\" and \\"St Jimmy,\\" they are just toning down the punk thing a bit and are progressing toward becoming actual musicians, not punk rockers anymore. This album is great, if you are mature at all you'll be able to understand it and if youre expecting Dookie 2, then it isnt for you. If youre expecting a different kind of Green Day with more meaningful lyrics and music that is more well-thought out, then it is for you
0316172324|5.0|Great Book!  A \\"blink\\" of a read but full of valuable insights.Gladwell's anecdotes were sometimes quirky and at the same time serious.  Great tool for those wanting to refine their own decision making skills.
B000021XS0|5.0|This CD is absolutely incredible!!! When I think of the amount of time and effort they mustve been into this album, my mind makes me dizzy. With a storyline of a man undergoing hypnosis and in turn living in the life of a woman who was murdered, the entire story, the music, the lyrics, the incredible imagination and stunning efforts on this album make it an unmistakable work of art. With the perfect blend of mellow and heavy music, John Petrucci's piercing guitar piercing thru your ear drums at the speed of light, John Myungs incredible bass skills sometimes matching the guitar, James Labries powerful vocals, Mike Portnoys thundering yet gracefully flowing drums and Jordan Rudess' incredible keyboard skills all prove that this band is one of the most talented around. Some of the coolest things are when during solos Johns guitar and jordans keyboard will match exactly to each other, all the while playing approximately 20,000 notes per 10 seconds. It's just amazing and if you are a lover of music and concept albums and works of art and well-thought out material, that you should definitely enjoy this album.
B000F5FNSE|5.0|Percy Jackson has always been different from other kids.  He's dyslexic and suffers from ADHD, and is always getting into trouble.  He's been expelled several times, and the only thing that holds his interest is Greek mythology.<br /><br />We soon learn that Percy has close ties with Mount Olympus, and when monsters from mythology start popping up looking for his blood, he ends up at a very special school for kids like himself, where he starts to put things together to find out who he really is.<br /><br />Before he knows it, he's off on a quest with his two friends, Grover and Annabeth, to recover a powerful lightning bolt, property of Zeus, which has been stolen, supposedly by Percy himself.  Zeus, Poseidon and Hades are having a little disagreement about the theft of the said lightning bolt, and unless Percy can retrieve it and return it in time, the resulting fallout will have earth-shattering consequences.<br /><br />This great (albeit relatively unknown) first book of the series is an easy read, and is sure to encourage young readers to improve their knowledge of Greek mythology, especially the stories of the Minotaur, Medusa and the gods Poseidon, Ares, Zeus, Hades, Kronos, Athena and so on.  Highly recommended for young readers in search of an original and imaginative adventure series.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, June 24, 2006
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Octavarium was a very good effort made from Dream Theater, and it is not quite the kind of album I expected from them. There are a few songs on this album that sound a bit poppy, but because Dream Theater doesnt often do this I really don't mind them. The songs \\"These Walls\\" and especially \\"I Walk Beside You'' sound like they belong on mainstream radio, but because the rest of the album proves that they still have their talent makes me accept those songs just fine. Octavarium is easily in my top 3 DT songs of all time, this song alone proves their utterly fascinating musicianship in the ability to play instruments, their ability to put songs together well and throw in the little things here and there in all the right parts, and their steady ablity to still write one hell of a set of lyrics that, if you pay attention to them, can really reach you in meaningful and true fashions. All-in-all, while this isnt their best album, it's still a very strong effort and I am not in any way disappointed, I cannot way for their next album, I have faith, they never disappoint.
038551123X|5.0|And this one is one of the best.  Dexter is a nice guy.  I would like to have him as my next door neighbor!    One comment, though, the person who recommended this book to me listened to it as an audiobook, and I started out that way.  I think it works better because you get to hear Dex, and listen to the words, all of them.    I know that sounds odd, \\"the words, all of them\\" but when I read, I sometimes skim.  If I had read the book only, I would never have gotten a chance to know, and like, Dex.    I don't drive enough to have finished the book by listening...I wanted to know... so I got the book from the library to finish.    If you like a good read, do not mind serial killers, this is a great book.  Not great lit, but, a great book.    p.s. although this is Amazon which sells books, you can get a book from a library....if you want to try the audio, check the library, then you will get to meet Dexter properly.
B00002E23E|5.0|THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME brings incredibly intricate stellar performances by all band members, and there is MUCH more on this DVD.<br /><br />The unique footage of the band members at their homes, with their precious children, their backstage and off stage happenings, along with superior footage of Robert Plant riding along [I believe it's] England's countryside, is just magical.<br /><br />This DVD is a classic in its own right, capturing one of their greatest performances at Madison Square Garden in 1973.<br /><br />If you want to watch much more than a concert, and you truly love the legendary music of Led Zeppelin, THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME will bring you so much more than you could ever except from the band, just as they always do.<br /><br />The sound AND video quality of this DVD is OUTSTANDING.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|Thank God -- after 15 years, the Chili Peppers returned to Rick Rubin's Laurel Canyon house and recorded the stunning sequel to Blood Sugar Sex Magic -- Stadium Arcadium, a flat-out tour de force which ends up surpassing it to become the Chilis' defining musical achievement. <br /> <br />When I first heard BSSM, I didn't get it. Beyond a couple of cuts with easily accessible hooks, most of it sounded noisy, harsh, flat, tinny. Based largely on the rave reviews here at Amazon, I played BSSM twice a day, in its entirety, while commuting to a distant project. After perhaps 20 times, I finally perceived the musical genius, the thematic unity, the fierce beauty and complexity concealed beneath the simplistic surface. BSSM became one of my favorite albums of all time. <br /> <br />Likewise, Stadium Arcadium has more to it than meets the ear -- much more. It is an album that can keep growing on you through dozens of listenings. All of the signature Chili Peppers touches are here: the crosstalk between Flea's bass and John Frusciante's lead; the vocal lead of Anthony Kiedis backed by John Frusciante's high harmony; the deft exclamation points of Chad Smith's drums; and the almost preternatural entwining of John's guitar passages with Anthony's vocals, which deserves further comment. <br /> <br />What John Frusciante has done on Stadium Arcadium borders on miraculous. He paints soundscapes of negative aural space for Anthony to fill with vocals; his guitar returns after a line of verse to offer commentary on it -- ironic, mirthful, mournful, as the case may be. Other times, it joins in as a wordless vocal accompaniment. Quite simply, Stadium Arcadium establishes John Frusciante's status as a guitar superstar. <br /> <br />Perhaps four cuts on the double album -- Dani California, Snow and Stadium Arcadium (Tracks 1, 2 and 4 on Disc 1) and Animal Bar (Track 9 on Disc 2) might be described as lightweight -- pleasant enough, though perhaps not fully developed. What remains is 24songs -- over 100 minutes -- of pure living water from the Chili Peppers. Fittingly, the summit occurs at dead center -- C'mon Girl, Wet Sand, Hey (the last three songs on Disc 1); plus Desecration Smile and Tell Me Baby (the first two tracks on Disc 2), are 25 minutes of the Chili Peppers at full cry, grooving in a white heat of aural perfection on a runaway train that won't stop. Yet, as always, in the midst of passages that may start out strident or bombastic, the Chilis will stop you in your tracks with a melodic interlude so sweet and unexpected as to bring tears to your eyes. <br /> <br />Jupiter and Mars, as names of the discs, invoke the sometimes otherworldly sound of the Chili Peppers. It's as if drawn from a distant corner of the galaxy, which has scales and chords unknown here, and wrought on instruments not made by hands. <br /> <br />I've spent more than half a lifetime searching for the essential music to be my companion for the remaining days. Stadium Arcadium, along with BSSM and the superb Off the Map live DVD, is most assuredly part of the canon. An incantatory triumph, resplendent with howls and hoedowns, elegies and anthems, Stadium Arcadium interposes verses of words with music that can't be expressed in words. It is most surely one of the finest things I have ever heard.
B00005JNRY|5.0|Through expert execution of Pixar technology, a young and initially feisty hot rod experiences a powerful coming of age after getting quite unexpectedly (from his perspective--of course!) stranded in small-town Radiator Springs enroute to California for the big race.<br /><br />The cars used in this film initially were introduced to myself and many other viewers through Chevron gasoline ads. However, film producers recognized that this project wouldn't have even made it out of the garage were it a corporate vehicle for Chevron. Instead, animation provides backdrop for a genuinely compelling coming-of-age story.<br /><br />Thinking of himself as hot stuff, Lightning McQueen is initially mortified by the judge's final sentence. Upon the recommendation of Sally, he gets ordered to stay and make amends for the street which he had destroyed--however accidentally--in his rush out to California. What was 'nothing' to him is home to these cars.<br /><br />Lightning is initially dismissive both of the town and its residents--convinced they cannot teach him anything.<br /><br />However, subsequently being bested by Doc in another race then takes him down a notch. For a 'family' movie, 'Cars' also contains very powerful and ever-relevant sociopolitical critiques of how highway expansion ultimately damages communities; Lightning discovers this ' helpful innovation' actually choked off the town's once vibrant tourist industry--killing their economy in the process.<br /><br />He also learns that the now-elderly Doc was once just like himself. This too adds depth to the movie. Despite the graying of America, we remain a very youth-obessed culture.  Contrasting with other nations, anything perceived to do with the elderly still gets perceived as `worn', `outdated' and `inferior'.<br /><br />Finally making it out to California, Lightning is surprised to find himself repeatedly thinking about Radiator Springs. Discovering that his new friends came to cheer him on, he is heartened. Although he does not win that coveted race, he does win the race of car life. A wiser Lightning returns to help revitalize Radiator Springs--in the tradition of all great movie heroes.<br /><br />In other words, it's not the typical `family fluff' which shies away from discussing anything substantive. People of all ages will want to race to cars!he is heartened. Although he does not win that coveted race, he does win the race of car life.

0393307050|5.0|I have read all of the Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin books. The series scores high for being consistent and historically accurate, and easily maintained my interest throughout. O'Brian  is generous with his characterizations and provides such a well choreographed and disciplined backstory that his characters seem to develop a life of their own. I found myself cheering along the central characters' exploits and was immersed in the friendship between Aubrey and long-time and trusted friend ships' doctor Maturin. O'Brian is the real \\"master and commander\\" here. His descriptions, geographic accounts, and true-life dialogue show a mastery that only a top-notch writer- one who is also an historian in his own right, could possess. I can highly recommend the entire series without reservation, especially to anyone holding an interest in history, nautical accounts, personal memoir, and geography.
B00005JOX6|4.0|Ever since he was on Saturday Night Live, I generally could not stomach Adam Sandler. Something about him had always managed to rub me the wrong way.<br /><br />However, the 'It's a wonderful life for the 21st century' basic premise of this movie---and the dangling premise of a finally more grown up Sandler effectively lured me in. I would not want to 'click' away this one.<br /><br />Michael Newman is an overworked architect who meets up with inventor Morty(Christopher Walken in an eccentric scientist role--invoking his 'Back to the Future' days) inside a very special section of a 'Bed, Bath, and Beyond' store.  It might sound campy to some people, but comes across as really minor precisely because the overall screenplay was written to actually be appealing.<br /><br />Heck, I even enjoyed David Hasselhoff's role as, Ammer, the slimmy boss from hell--whom Michael escapes from through the aid of that special remote. The irony of 'king of cheese' Hasselhoff of all people playing the role (and with an eerie perfection to boot) ultimately left me commiserating with Sandler. This is something I never expected to find myself doing in a million years. I previously would have denied even the vaguest possibility!<br /><br />Another memorable performance comes from Henry Winkler, who plays Ted Newman, Michael's dad. In this film he regresses and ages when the remote continues clicking away. Michael initially thought the remote was cool, but subsequently concedes the device has serious consequences with use.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Audioslave surprised the bloody Hell out of me. I figured, as many did, that they would only last through one album and then fade into obscurity as other \\"supergroups\\" tend to.(Oh well, Velvet Revolver kind of sucked anyway) Well they proved us all wrong. Their first album was very strong, although kind of spotty in places, and \\"Out of Exile\\" seems to pick up the slack that \\"Audioslave\\" left behind. The album has a great sound, and really brings out the best in each of the musicians. Like fine wine, Audioslave seems to get better with age! Can't wait for \\"Revelations\\"!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|I saw this movie in the 1986 theatrical re-release and subsequently on DVD. I can readily attest that it does not age! I'm not even a dog person myself, but the plot is not about dogs per say, but the life adventures that a young cocker spaniel named Lady has.<br /><br />Living with owners named Darling and Jim Dear, Lady apparently leads a pretty good life. Assuming that every dog leads the good life she and her friends enjoy, she is later shocked to meet Tramp, who lives on the streets. However, she soon realizes that he has a good heart beneath that rough exterior.<br /><br />She needs his help when crusty old Aunt Sarah comes to mind the house--and the newborn baby. Initially not understanding that Lady feels protective towards the baby, she also selectively ignores the damage which her two Siamese cats were actually responsible for doing to that very elaborate Victorian house.<br /><br />Amazingly, Aunt Sarah presumes that Lady was responsible for wrecking the house--and attempts to muzzle her up!<br /><br />Like any streetwise character, Tramp has lots of connections and solutions to any problem which pops up. However, he does not come across as an annoying know-it-all who you would want to quickly get rid of. Tramp is instead somebody whom we are supposed to both identify and then want to hang out with in rough environments. Lady had 'gentle' friends named Jock and Trusty, but they can't help out in a world also outside of their own.<br /><br />Of course, the spaghetti dinner scene remains one of the most enduring of all time--it made a VERY profound impact on me well before I was even old enough to myself consider dating. I imagined that I would eventually share a romantic dinner of my own with my own \\"Mr. right\\".<br /><br />However, Tramp's decision to go after the rat in the nursery also remains a powerful scene. He then felt no loyalty to anybody in that family other than Lady, but saved the baby anyway! Tramp proved that class is not a matter of breeding but what you do with your self!<br /><br />Despite his earlier professed discomfort with collars, Tramp ultimately gets adopted by the Darlings. Therefore, he and Lady do in fact live happily ever after.ite his earlier professed discomfort with collars, Tramp ultimately gets adopted by the Darlings.

B00005JMEW|5.0|This is my second favorite film by Quentin Tarentino (my first bieng Pulp Fiction), a large part of it's 'greatnes' is the amazing amount of blood and gore, i just loved the big fight (the one before she fights Lucy Lui), the spurting blood and cool moves make it an awesome mass-killing scene.  <br />The acting in this film is great, Umer Thermon, Lucy Lui plus some other good actors all take part in making this film as good as it is. And the way it turns black and white for a while is good too along with the cartoon scenes aswell!  <br />And the last point wich i had to bring up sooner or later is that this film is directed by the one and only Quentin Tarantino who of course brought us many great film like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill volume, and this film and many other great films, he's also acted in some films. <br />This is an exelent film wich should be watched by everyone who has time to do so!
6305692572|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I couldnt stop crying. When a man loves a woman (very stupid name for a movie like this) is based in the storie of an alcoholic woman who struggles to get over her sickness. Her man (Andy Garcia)tries to do what ever he can in order to help her but at the end, the real conclusion is the fact that she has to face her addiction. Love, sick love and codependency are the 3 basic points of this movie. AMAZIN MOVIE.<br /><br />La primera vez que vi esta pel&iacute;cula no pude parar de llorar. Cuando un hombre ama a una mujer (un nombre bastante est&uacute;pido para una pel&iacute;cula como esta) se basa en la historia de una mujer alcoh&oacute;lica, que lucha por superar su enfermedad. Su hombre (Andy Garc&iacute;a)trata de hacer todo lo que puede para ayudarla pero al final, la real conclusi&oacute;n es que ella tiene que aceptar su adicci&oacute;n.

B0009KA7BS|3.0|The story is simple; self-centered John Constantine: Hellblazer (Keanu Reeves) did a \\"no no\\" in his youth ensuring him a place in the underworld and to compound the problem he is to be short lived due to a smoking habit. <br />Mean time he, due to his accident he has the ability to see angles and demons. Even though he is conceited and knows where he will be going he still finds time to do some good for mankind and in the process send a few demons back where they came from. <br /> <br />Something has gone horribly wrong with the balance. And with the aid of his young sidekick and a medium that is well done by (Rachel Weisz) he intends to get to the nature of the problem.  <br /> <br />The character of Constantine comes from the DC comic world and has been modified a tad to fit a movie with a beginning middle and end. <br /> <br />I could not help but notice Tilda Swinton who played Gabriel. She made you feel that you were watching a first class movie. <br /> <br />The only redeeming feature of value of the movie is not the movie its self but the audio track that explains wheat they are trying to do in the making of the movie. In fact you could just bypass the movie and listen to the voice over audio instead and save yourself two hours. <br /> <br />I think I should have watched the two disk version as even with the audio track they refer to many things that are not in the movie.

B00003CXPJ|5.0|This is the film that started my love affair with films starring the so-called 'Frat Pack' (Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson et al). <br />A parody of the male modelling world, there are some truly hilarious moments of the film - for example, when Zoolander and Hansel act like apes when trying to figure out how to turn the computer on, David Duchovny's cameo as a hand model and the school \\"For Kids Who Can't Read Good\\". The scene in the petrol station alone is worth buying the DVD for. Vince Vaughn makes a fleeting appearance, although it took me a while to recognise him under all the soot! <br /> <br />When I first watched the DVD I was laughing uncontrollably. Stiller, as Zoolander, provides instructions on how to work the menu. There is a satisfactory Easter Egg hidden within the Special Features menu, as Stiller says \\"For all you Internet geeks that search the Web for these things\\" (I'm one of them). <br /> <br />I really cannot fault this DVD. The film is extremely funny, and all the extras do not disappoint. If you have seen and enjoyed any of the Frat Pack's films, then this one won't let you down either. <br />
B00006J9OT|3.0|A big international hit, this cd works that boring crossover magic for audiences that usually don't listen to jazz. Don't get me wrong, this is not bad music (for instance, it's much better than Norah Jones' country-pop-jazz), but it's not satisfactory for jazz purists. It's good background music.<br /><br />As a reviewer in an Italian jazz magazine inteligently observed -if you like girls singing while playing piano, you'll probably like this album. Ofcourse, Ms Krall is quite tallented and it shows at some of the songs. But she came along at time when female jazz performers can make some money by making some consessions to popular taste...<br /><br />If Ella, Billie, Sarah or Satchmo recorded so much commercial junk, if even Gillespie's big band attempted to record rock and roll, why shouldn't Ms Krall record songs by some of the Billy Joels of the pop-world?
B00005JMUA|5.0|If you managed to sit through the ok-ish part one, then your reward starts right here. <br />This is just like Volume 1, but amped up about ten times over. For starters, the storyline is more convincing, detailed and interesting. The Bride (Uma Thurman) has more to do than just kill lots and lots of people. <br /> <br />And because of that, there is also more, and better, character development. The characters were one of the better elements of part 1, and of course, all the survivors are back for this volume, but with more depth.  <br /> <br />Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah and Uma are all fantastic as their respective characters, truly making you believe in their twisted, violent world.  <br /> <br />David Carridine is brilliant as the titular Bill. His performance makes you sympathetic to Bill, despite you knowing that he is the baddie, and an exceptionally cruel person. But we still love him! A fantastic character played to perfection. <br /> <br />There's also less action than part 1 and all the more better for it. Part 1's overblown, cartoony action is replaced with shorter, but more gritty, realistic and violent set pieces. Check out the trailer fight between Uma nd Darryl Hannah. Superb. <br /> <br />A shout should also go out for Robert Rodriguez's music. Allegedly, he composed the film for only $1, and if so, Tarantino certainly got his moneys worth! <br /> <br />Tarantino's direction also shines more clearly here, with the scene where The Bride is buried alive particularly springing to mind. Horrifying, chilling, yet stylishly done.  <br /> <br />In fact, the one thing that really drags this film down a bit is the tutorial scenes with Pei Mei. Slightly dull, a bit too long, it takes you away from the real crux of the story at a crucial point. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, a fine film that deserves to be watched, even if you do have to sit through part 1 first. You will be glad you did. <br />
B0000042MY|4.0|If u have seen the movie then you have surely noticed the music! Without the music there could be no movie! Awesome movie and a must have soundtrack!
B00005JMYI|5.0|I'll get this out of the way immediately, this is not a film that will appeal to everyone. It is what could be only described as a 'marmite' film. Some will adore its comic irreverence, and some will quite frankly 'not get it'. To me personally this is my favourite comedy of all time, and quite possibly my favourite film in general. I will attempt to not use any of the classic quotations from this film as it will spoil the brilliance of hearing them for the first time.  <br /> <br />The story is set in a sexist news studio in San Diego, America. The lead anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) falls for a woman at a party, and she incredibly, to Ron, rejects his not so subtle advances. The next day that very woman, Veronica Corningstone is appointed as a journalist in their very newsroom. Cue brilliant pick-up attempts, witty one liners, emotional breakdowns and scenes that don't leave the mind for weeks. Brick is the lovable fool, who interrupts with odd - yet hilarious - lines at random parts of the movie, he is the weatherman. The sports commentator Champ Kind, is a more roguish persona, who suffers a mental breakdown after Ron decides to go on a date with Veronica instead of attending their monthly pancake breakfast. Yes it's that irrelevant. Bryan Fantana is the 'man on the scene' and is the typical ladies man. All the acting in this film deserves to be noted, they all convey the different personalities of the charchters superbly and somehow without laughing.  <br /> <br />All in all I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone with an irrelevant humour or in need of something up-lifting, which this film oddly fulfils. A cult classic in the form of Zoolander. Do watch out for the battle scene and a cameo from Jack Black. Pure comic brilliance. <br />

B000059LGC|5.0|Having only seen this movie on TV, the commercials take away from the whole. Now I have gotten to see the whole movie and was surprised to see things I had 'missed' before. Another movie worth a second and third look.
B00008CLOA|4.0|The Super Audio version does in fact provide much more clarity, the ability to hear detail not available with regular CDs.  Of course \\"Dark Side\\" is perhaps, in my opinion, one of Pink Floyd's finest albums.  That said, the SACD version provides better sound stage imaging (depth).  The format has much better high frequencies, along with well balanced mid to low frequencies.  The disc was well mixed without any suggestion of \\"ping-pong\\" which is so often found on late sixties music, most notably many of the \\"Beetles\\" albums.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this SACD version to anyone that cares for high end sound.  Of course it's important to have the sound equipment capable of providing truly hi-definition sound.   <br />
0780622650|5.0|Growing up a fan of the original TV series. This movie was very entertaining. Watching this movie helped me to decide that I would like to add the original to my movie collection. Very happy that the techinal side of the movie was provided, I like seeing the CG behind the acting.
B00008YJH5|5.0|I can't believe I let one of the greatest CD's ever slip thru the cracks these past 15 years.That is untill recently when I discovered this timeless gem. <br />\\"Where was my mind all of these years?\\" I ask myself.  <br />Surfer Rosa is now being played(for about the 100th time)on my CD player as I write this. <br />I only have one small disagreement with those who claim \\"Where Is My Mind\\" being the best song on Surfer Rosa. <br />All of the songs,in my opinion,are the best songs on Surfer Rosa. <br />They all rank from great to great on one of the greatest CD's ever. <br />Wondering whether to buy it or not? <br />Follow this simple advice. <br />Don't do as I did and let it go unlistened to for over 15 years. <br />JUST.BUY.IT.NOW.!!!!!! AS IN NOW.!!!!! <br />
B000FQJAIW|3.0|I understand that this is just another stab at the hardcore fan who wants to own every piece of Star Wars merchandise in existence, even though he/she is unhappy that Lucas won't fulfill their wishes. But that doesn't apply to the average consumer, and honestly, if you are someone who is largely satisfied with your VHS tapes or laserdiscs of the original films, or if the newly restored versions don't bother you, then you really have no reason to complain, because you have no reason to purchase these new DVDs. If you're angry that the films aren't being presented in anamorphic widescreen or DTS (or if you're so shallow as to complain about the box-art), then you have to ask yourself what's more important: The audio and visual presentations of the films on DVD, or the films being released in their original form? Yes, it's a trade-off, but unless you don't care about shelling out more money for yet another needless set of videos -- and given all the complaints I've read, a lot of you do care very much -- then you'll have to decide.    Blame Lucas as much as you like for being money-hungry and insensitive to his fanbase. You have a right to feel sore. But let's not forget that those of you who have purchased multiple editions of this trilogy again and again on different video formats are the ones responsible for that. If you've been unsatisfied with the video releases of Star Wars up until this time, you should have never purchased them. If you're unsatisfied with these new releases, don't purchase them either. You have a choice, and if you're upset that these new releases aren't the way you've always wanted them, then you don't have to settle for an inferior product. You'd be better off waiting for George to have the big one, because I'm sure whoever takes over his estate will capitalize just as much on the franchise (without any concerns over Lucas's \\"vision\\").    And by the way, as long as there continue to be new video formats, there will always be re-releases. Justbecause Lucas will yet again update his films for HD and Blu-Ray formats doesn't necessarily mean that you need to support those updates by purchasing them every time he makes a few insignificant changes. You're the ones making the decision that the new extra features and improved quality is enough to warrant re-purchasing them. Even if HD and Blu-Ray will look and sound significantly better compared to the restored DVDs, the DVDs available now will still continue to look and sound pretty damn good. Don't blame the manufacturers because you constantly desire the latest and greatest technology.
0446691437|5.0|This book came recommended from another website that I frequent and trust (CST), and after I read it I understood why: in the clear, succinct, and dynamic language that you would expect from our best known writer of ancient and classical Greek historical fiction, comes this little tome describing one of the great inner obstacles everyone faces when trying to initiate great change -- and both a novel and very old way of seeing it, and then overcoming it. <br /> <br />There's nothing goofball or froo-froo about this, Steven Pressfield is very cleary conveying his experience as a writer who approaches his writing professionally, i.e. seriously and how he feeds himself. His method, which parallels and nicely complements \\"The Creative Habit,\\" by choreographer Twyla Tharp, is all about discipline, and hard work: the muse favors those who prepare for her arrival, daily and without fail. <br /> <br />A necessary tool for achieving is the ability to persevere despite the inner voices that pull one down, from eating better, exercising regularly, thinking of a better life, writing that next chapter, paying those bills now, making that dream project a reality. Pressfield makes very clear, as only a professional writer can, how destructive this tendency can be, and how to push through, in basic, no-nonsense ways.

B0000584V3|5.0|This is music as art, not music as a consumer item. When you listen to a lot of music (i.e. you branch out from Good Charlotte or other MTV bands) you realize that there are certain beats or progressions that naturally catch your ear; MTV-type bands literally brainwash you with these. Every song on MTV has simple 1-3-5 guitar progression and a length to fit short attention spans.  Opeth's music defies these pop conventions -- as a result, some listeners will find them unpleasant at first.  But if you listen through Blackwater Park a few times then your prejudices will start to break down and you'll realize that this is smart, complex and beautiful music.   <br /> <br />One reviewer wrote, \\"Opeth is the most pretentious band on the market. The goal of commercial musical performance is SUPPOSED to be to make something that people will enjoy listening to, and therefore want to buy it.\\" This reviewer ought to work for the tobacco companies. Music is an artform, sir... or it was, once.

B000EOTAM6|2.0|Aeon Flux, the movie and the character, bare little resemblance to the cult animation featured on MTV's Liquid Television in the 1990s. The more you enjoyed the animation, the less you will like this film.  <br /> <br />However, the production elements are truly amazing. The sets and costumes are all eye popping. The film also explores some fun futuristic concepts like telepathic message pills, plants engineered as weapons, and liquid memory pools. If you enjoyed the art direction of \\"I, Robot\\" and \\"The Island\\", you will enjoy looking at this film too.  <br /> <br />While Charlize Theron is one of the most beautiful actresses of today, she's simply miscast. In the animation, Aeon Flux is a lithe sinewy gymnast composed of harsh angles. Miss Theron is simply too curvy to play such a sculpted boney-butt warrior. Her voluptuous body, combined with sloppy wire-work combine to make some acrobatics that simply impossible to believe. Another problem is that in the animation, Aeon was mostly an enigma. Here, they flesh her out with a love story that really doesn't work.  <br /> <br />If you've never heard of Aeon Flux, you may have a moderately good time. It's one of those movies that you can \\"fold clothes to\\" -- mildly engaging, but certainly won't require your full attention.
0060589469|5.0|While \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" has been criticized as mushy philosophy, it is still a great read, and it justly deserves its ongoing cult following. In the 21st century, we've grown accustomed to trash goods and services: corrupt corporations and politicians; shoddy consumer goods; diminishing or disappearing service. \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" still provides at least a psychological antidote -- viz, a benchmark for quality.
B00004YA66|2.0|This film suffers from some of the worst old-age make-up I've ever seen in a modern film -- so fake looking that its distracting! This film also suffers from that long-standing cliche of the hero being saved at the last minute by the mystery gunshot out of nowhere. I hate that!
B000FQJAIW|1.0|For years Pukas has been saying that the Original masters for the theatrical versions of these movies had been ruined, and yet now that Bluray and HDD formats are being released all of a sudden  Pukas finds them for release just before the format wars begin...

B0009P42S2|3.0|A gorgeous steampunk adventure to be sure, but ultimately this feature suffers from the sameness of many anime titles: uninvolving characters and lack of plot direction -- plus the ol' \\"teen boy saves the world\\" chestnut. YAWN!  <br /> <br />While the English dub is technically fine, the voices themselves are grating. As with many cartoons, a female voices the lead young boy. She consistantly sounds like a girl, which is distracting. Similarly, the lead girl is completely obnoxious -- she is voiced with zero charm or subtlety. She's a one-note brat you want to push off a moving train after five minutes of listening to her!  <br /> <br />On the plus side, the DVD includes a nice featurette on the computer graphics used in the movie. Visually, this movie is fantastic! At the end of the day, it's simply too long and dull at more than 2 hours!

B0001XAPX8|2.0|A quiet deliberate movie ultimately suffers from having too much star power. No matter how scruffy and wain the filmmakers try to make Nicole Kidman look, she's still Nicole Kidman. Her portrayal of a janitor really pushes the limits of \\"suspension of disbelief\\" with her delicate features and legs that go on forever.  <br /> <br />And Anthony Hopkins is also miscast as a Jewish professor with a hard knock, secret past. While he remains one of my favorite actors, he cannot escape his \\"Britishness\\" which is even more unbelievable once you discover what his character's past is! The real discovery of this film is Wentworth Miller's absolutely astonishing turn as the teenage Anthony Hopkins.  <br /> <br />Ultimately, the film is worth seeing for Wentworth Miller alone. But the casting of two megawatt Hollywood actors hurts the believability of this film in the end.

0553801503|4.0|Okay, here's the deal in my opinion on Book # 4. Martin was forced to release earlier than his writng would allow, a work that was within page count, and within some sort of committed timeline. The book was late, and I ordered it on Amazon based on some BS date a year prior to it's actual relaease. I would have preferred waiting until he got what he wanted out the door which would have involved Martin NOT splitting Book 4 into 4 & 5. Martin kept his fans entirely and responsibly abreast (don't smirk Paris) of the situation on his website.<br /><br />There is no way this is a Goodkind or Jordan sellout...Martin has called the ball on the series since the beginning at 6 books. Due to this slight aberration the series will go to 7. End of story. Goodkind, and now Jordan, are sellouts for the dough, or for putting out work just to release something. Martin will not. I believe only Stephen King has a library in his head that can be released at any time. Most people have to let the story happen, and few listen to the muse. Martin listens to his muse and rewards us, the fans, with a properly written book.

0553062182|5.0|Reading this book was an important step in my healing as I found the description of \\"HSP\\" fit me well. Elaine's book opened up a whole new understanding for me.  This book taught me practical details and information about how to manage my own sensitivities in a world that moves too fast, is too loud, can be harsh, etc.  I found her book to be life-changing as I learned helpful strategies for daily living and for communicating with others about my sensitivities. As a holistic massage therapist, I recommend this book to my clients and acquaintances who are struggling with the issues of high sensitivity.  It is one of the more popular books in my lending library for clients. The one part that Elaine could improve upon is better practical suggestions for health care for HSPs.  She describes the difficulties in finding appropriate practitioners to work with, but does not go much beyond conventional medicine in her evaluation of what works for sensitives.  I found that my own sensitivies were much improved by working on my overall health using alternative self-help methods. While I'm still an HSP, the health improvements greatly increased my ability to function in the world.  Overall, her book is carefully and sensitively written -- a wonderful resource.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|i thought this was a very well done adaptation of the musical of which i am a huge fan.
B00004T8RK|4.0|While it's not the best Pearl Jam album, this is my personal favorite. A lot of this will sound biased, but believe me, it ain't. This is in my opinion, Pearl Jam at their most focused and determined. After the uneven flow of No Code and the exhausting Yield, this is Vedder and co. with new drummer Matt Cameron setting out to make the album they're way, not the radio-friendly way, and the results are fascinating.  <br /> <br />At the onset of Binaural, Eddie supposedly had writer's block, and as a result, there was more chipping in from the entire band. Deciding to go with a new producer (Tchad Blake) and a new two-speaker sound, Pearl Jam deliver their most collaborative and serious effort yet. The result is the spaciest of their albums, perfectly encapsulated in the binary star on the cover, and the artwork found inside. People either love it or hate it, me being the former. <br /> <br />The music is wide-ranging. Mainly between the two polar-opposites of hard-hitting punk (Breakerfall, God's Dice, Evacuation) and mid-tempo broodings (Light Years, Nothing As It Seems, Thin Air, Of The Girl). Vedder gets political and complex in Insignificance and Grievance. Stone gets bluesy on Rival. And the band delivers two of their very best songs in their catalogue with Sleight Of Hand and the epic Parting Ways. In the strangest and most haunting devlopment, Vedder picks up Yukulele for Soon Forget. To explain these songs would take hours, there is so much to learn from the album with each repeated listen, there is no way to properly sum any of these songs up in ten words or less. Thanks to the spacy production, and cryptic lyrics, there is always some detail, be it big or small, lurking just out of reach.  <br /> <br />I've listened to this album many times, and I still can't tell you what it's all about, but it seems to be about finding purpose and reason for why we are where we are in a universe of infinitie proportions and possibilities. The best time to listen to this album would be on a starry night when you're lying on your back looking up at the stars, reflecting on whatever you may, and possibly questioning things for which you have no answer, just a theory. <br /> <br />If you just heard Ten or Vs. and you're looking for a hard hitting album, you'll likely be disappointed with this one. But if you're looking for deep meaning and great food for thought, this is your album. Put on your earphones, sit back, and gaze upon the infinite.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|I first watched this show on DVD not knowing anything about the story. I fell in love with the characters only to find \\"Firefly\\" had flew a bit under my radar when it was on TV. I have since watched all the \\"Firefly\\" episodes and still cant get enough. Excellent.
B000002JS6|5.0|\\"Back In Black\\" is definitely the most popular AC/DC albums ever. To date, it has sold more than 20 million copies. From the hard rocker \\"Hells Bells, to the rock 'n' roll anthem \\"Rock 'N' Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\", this album is filled with rock never before seen by AC/DC. <br /> <br />1. Hells Bells- This song is very catchy and the sound of the bells in the beginning gives it an ominous feel. 9/10 <br /> <br />2. Shoot To Thrill- Another hit on this album, it's pretty good, but gets a little repetitive. 8/10 <br /> <br />3. What Do You Do For Money Honey- This song is just so-so, but not horrible. 7/10 <br /> <br />4. Givin' The Dog A Bone- I like this song because it has a good beat, but not a standout track. 8/10 <br /> <br />5. Let Me Put My Love Into You- A song that has a cool chorus and good guitar. 8/10 <br /> <br />6. Back In Black- Classic AC/DC song. They fuse rocking guitar beats with a small almost-rap by Brian Johnson. 9/10 <br /> <br />7. You Shook Me All Night Long- Pretty good song, just too overplayed. Most AC/DC fans will love this song. 8/10 <br /> <br />8. Have A Drink On Me- A great song with an infectious beat and catchy chorus. 9/10 <br /> <br />9. Shake A Leg- An okay song, but not a standout track on this album. Nice guitar though. 7/10 <br /> <br />10. Rock 'N' Roll Ain't Noise Pollution- The absolute best song on this album. A rockin' guitar anthem even the slightest AC/DC fans would love. 10/10 <br /> <br /> All in all, this album is a must-have. You owe it to yourself to go out and buy this album even if you're not an AC/DC fan, because you are missing out.
B000EOTAM6|5.0|This is my most favorite movie of 2005; a true dream on the silver screen.  Being a huge fan of the world of \\"Aeon Flux\\" I found this incarnation to be a great hommage to the classic Aeon Flux character.  While the story was \\"nothing new\\", it worked well with the characters and gave Aeon and Trevor a back history that had been previously left blank.  Charlize's performance was wonderful as well; Ms. Theron filled out that her suit like a true champ. <br /> <br />The true beauty of the film was the art direction.  The world of Bregna was truly realized in true life.  It's insistance on using natural beauty over industrial was a true genius to the art team.  And major props to the costume team. <br /> <br />The extra on the DVD are also well done.  With lots of featurettes for the fan in all of us to indulge and enjoy over and over again.  I won't hold my breath for \\"Aeon Flux 2\\" but at least I have this gem to treasure.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|Just back in NYC from Seattle where, since it's baseball season, I heard plenty from Mariners lead broadcaster Dave Niehaus and his trademark call of \\"My, oh my!\\" to punctuate the most exciting Mariner moments.  Well, it struck me that \\"my, oh my\\" is exactly how I feel about Funeral.  So even though I rarely chip in when over 300 reviews have already been written, this one is worth it.  Nine months or so after downloading Funeral I return to it three or four times a week for its passion; its driven music; its stories of urban days, nights and dreams; and the raging, yet somehow always controlled singing.  Some cuts are not as superb as others, but the Neighborhoods songs Tunnels, Power Outage, and 7 Kettles, along with Rebellion (Lies) and In the Backseat, grab you, shake you and won't let you go.  Like hearing London Calling, or Don't Be Cruel, or Like a Rolling Stone, the first time -- my, oh my, indeed.
B00006LJ6X|5.0|This is where the band peaked---at the height of their popularity, they stretched out and took chances and it worked.  After their two great initial albums, the double album format had began to become a bit strained by Chicago III.  Two great single disc sets followed, but nobody was really expecting the foray into jazz that they took on Chicago VII.   Originally it was planned to be an entire jazz album.  Instead it's a double album which transitions nicely from the jazz to the standard pop material. <br /> <br />The first side of the original LP disc one is all jazz instrumentals:  \\"Prelude to Aire\\", \\"Aire\\" and \\"Devil's Sweet\\"--all as good as any jazz/rock fusion coming out during the era. There's a nice latin tinge to this stuff with percussion from Laudir DeOliveria, who would later become a full-fledged member of the band.  A later interview with James Pankow revealed that Terry Kath insisted on adding a percussionist to the band because of his increasing frustration with Danny Seraphine's inconsistant tempos during their live performances.  Whatever the reason, the latin percussion sends the music in a nice direction. <br /> <br />Side Two opens with the experimental \\"Italian From New York\\" and \\"Hanky Panky\\", a nice jazz ditty giving us some classic Chicago brass sounds and a great trombone solo from Pankow.  When we first hear a voice on the record---1 minute and a half into \\"Life Saver\\" and some 27 minutes into the CD, we still don't get anything traditional---we get Robert Lamm sounding as if he's singing through a megaphone.  But this is a good solid Lamm rocker and a nice transition to the rest of the album.  Side two closes with Peter Cetera's \\"Happy Man\\".   This is one of my favorite Cetera ballads, and was one of my favorites on the album back in 1974.  We had no idea then that just ballads would become his tradmark in a few short years. <br /> <br />Side Three opens with (I've Been) Searchin' So Long.  Heavy on orchestration, this nevertheless is oneof Pankow's best ballads and one of their biggest hits.  It seques into the Tijuana Brass-esque \\"Mongonucleois\\" a fun and enjoyable Pankow instrumental.  Up next is the moody rocker \\"Song of the Evergreens\\" from Terry Kath.  This features the first time someone other than Kath, Lamm or Cetera sang lead on a Chicago song---here it's Lee Loughnane singing.  Strangely enough, he sounds like a weak Terry Kath.  His vocal is nice enough, but it seems pointless that Kath didn't sing it himself.  Next is \\"Byblos\\", another atmospheric ballad from Kath that is one of the best things he ever wrote.  Other than Kath and Seraphine, no one else from the band appears on this track. <br /> <br />Side Four gives us Cetera's \\"Wishing You Were Here\\".  Written at the last minute as a vehicle for the Beach Boys to sing on, this became one of their biggest hits.   One question I've always had is--who sings the verse on this song?  The credits list Cetera as the only lead singer, but unless this is a low register of his we've never heard, it doesn't really sound like him.  I've seen some sources list Terry Kath as the singer, but it doesn't sound that much like him either. <br /> <br />Next is Lee Loughnane's \\"Call On Me\\".  His first songwriting attempt would prove to be his best.  Another huge hit for the band.  Next we hear the band try to get a bit funky with Lamm's \\"Women Don't Want To Love Me\\", with a lot of clavinet and funky wah-wah guitar.  The album closes the soulful \\"Skinny Boy\\" featuring the Pointer Sisters on background vocals.  The long slow fade is an appropriate way to end this classic album.   There's a lot of diversity on this set and it all comes together in a way that only a band as 'hot' as Chicago was in 1974 could pull off. <br /> <br />The CD includes an earlier, must faster version of \\"Byblos\\" as a bonus track that is a nice way of showing how songs change during the writing and recording process.   <br /> <br /> <br />

0800177177|2.0|Having just finished reading the novel itself, I figured it would be a great time to introduce myself to Coppola's version of the film.  Now I already was curious how the film would go, since to stay true to the book would actually mean often times to bore the audience, because of the 'journal'-istic style of writing Bram used (pun intended).  At the same time though, to be original might be to skew too much the story.  So I figured they would have to walk a thin line. <br /> <br />At first my fears were alleviated, especially since I believed that Hopkins and Coppola would carry the film.  However, not too far into the movie all that was dispelled, as they messed up in both originality, and staying true to the story. <br /> <br />For instance, there is no dead wife/resurrected wife bit in the book.  I'm sorry, but it's just not there, which would be fine if it had added value to the movie.  However, I didn't think it did, and Jonathan's journal writings being used at the beginning of the story (although this time very true to the book) also took away from what should have been an exciting opening. <br /> <br />Did I mention how silly Dracula was?  The least we should do is not laugh at seeing him, especially old-Dracula; while the most we should do is actually understand the characters fear.  But, with all of the actors, including Hopkins (who had the best part still), there was little to really care about. <br /> <br />Ultimately, Coppola's rendition seemed more like a rush-job then anything.   I mean it is very sad to see that the best film work parts are when the director re-hashes a sequence from his early days, specifically the end of Godfather 1.  This is shown in the juxtaposition of the Dracula and Mina sequence, while Dr. Hellsing is ceremoniously destroying the boxes of earth. <br /> <br />So, to say this is a disappointment is an understatement, but if you think Coppola can never go wrong then I guess this is your film.
0446577383|5.0|This is by far one of the best books my friends and I have read in the last couple of years!! The characters are so absorbing and mysterious! The plot is very timely and OUTSTANDING!!!! I couldn't put this book down until I had read it!! (The same is true of the 3 friends I loaned it to!) <br />I highly encourage you to check this story out! If you like suspense and and mystery, with some action mixed in, then you'll love this book!
0609610570|3.0|Don't get me wrong - the authors cover execution, the gaps between intent and results, and inability to create effective teams in great detail. If you've never read anything on it, this book is a decent book on the subject. However, as other reviewers have pointed out, this is a subject well covered within other books directly (Welch's Winning, etc.) or as part of a larger framework of how to run your life (7 Habits + Getting Things Done) or your business (Built to Last). It's an essential topic, but not treated in as engaging or wholistic manner as several other books in this genre.
B00005JKBC|5.0|I know some people find it just average or a mildly entertaining flick but for some reason it is one of my top 5 films. Honestly, I couldn't really tell you why I like this film so much. Maybe because of all the locations and the events that occur in them? Maybe it's because I like the acting? Honestly, I have no idea. For some reason I could watch this film every week and I would enjoy it all the more. If you didn't know, the soundtrack is worth every penny.

This book fits that mold in the context of describing precisely the framework that is needed to build a company that will both last a long time and outperform the market.<br /><br />The \\"prequel\\" to Good to Great, this book covers the principles and practices of great companies, using a variety of companies that have lasted multiple chief officers for basis and comparisons. If you're looking to bring some moral fiber and long-term success to your company, I can't think of a better book to read and act upon.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Grey's anatomy is not the typical doctor hospital show that you're used to seeing. This show is about young interns trying to survive a very difficult, competitive, and harsh program to try and become head surgeons. The characters on here our all diverse and unique, and you are immediately drawn to them. All very likable characters. Some of the surgeries grossed me out, i have a weak stomache. So you may find yourself turning your head and yelling e[...]  <br />It took me awhile to buy this dvd because i usually hate hospital shows, but i kept hearing my peers talk about it, so i went ahead and bought it. There is a good mix of drama, romance, and comedy that keep this show entertaining. Only nine episodes on here, but it's worth the money. I can't wait til season two comes out September 12th. Gonna be more pricey than season one, but will have far more episodes.
006085880X|5.0|When I first read the back of the book, I put the book aside because I wasnt sure whether I could read such a depressing story.  Sure enough I read it and I loved it!

I agree in part with the criticism of this movie - it is far from perfect - but it is well worth watching - and I don't enjoy most hollywood films.. not great but good.

B000AWYOG4|4.0|Everything about Dark Water seems broken. The couple's marriage. The apartment. The people. The school. The janitor and owner. Everything about Dark water seems old, weary, confused and drab. Except, of course, for a very pink backpack found by a child on the rooftop of an apartment building. This one source of color and life in the movie points us to the one source of distress and death in the movie.<br /><br />Dark Water isn't a cliche ghost story, and for the most part that is good. The acting is wonderful, but the film still suffers from distracting flaws. Dark Water does drag occasionally, and often wavers between scary and suspenseful and just plain overdone. The major flaw with the film is that too much time is spent staring at the ceiling, literally. This tends to slow down the suspense at times.<br /><br />Another area where this film suffers, although to a smaller degree, is including scenes that have no business being in the film. Certain scenes do not advance the plot, and seem to be included for character development, or possibly to make us think that a certain character might be scheming against the protagonist. For example, there is a scene is which a lawyer talks on a cell phone to a woman, and then the scenes cuts to the back of the lawyer's car. From there, an African American male makes several comments that neither flesh out the lawyer's character nor have any bearing whatsoever on the film. We never see this \\"back seat man\\" again. Consider it 30 seconds of wasted time.<br /><br />I have never criticised a film for including useless scenes before, but felt it was needed for a review of Dark Water. There are more scenes than the one stated, including a scene in which the lawyer misleads the woman, and then enters a theatre alone. The scene is pointless and again, a waste of time.<br /><br />Other than this, I found the film to be entertaining, fresh and somewhat suspenseful. It really wasn't cliche or cheesy in the least. If you are looking for a fresh, well-acted ghost story without the modern trappings of gore or cheap frights, Dark Water is a good choice.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 57<br /><br />27 (out of 50).

B000BCKFWK|5.0|Sin City is a collection of semi-connected scenes for various people in a wild city.  Prostitution, pedophilia, murder, and corruption, it's just like Detroit.  Aside from the plot, the cinematography is stunning.  It's trendy, mostly black-and-white, with emphasis on specific colors to draw attention to ideas or concepts that enhance or benefit the movie.  Whether it's the blue eyes of an \\"innocent\\" prostitute, the yellow deformities of a killer, or the kaliedescope of colors indicating confusion and tension, the vivid colors are the tip of an amazingly represented film.<br /><br />The movie starts with the murder of a young woman.  At first it seems pointless, but it's simply a buildup for the chaos to come.<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays a detective trying to save a young girl from the grips of an evil pedophiliac.  Unfortunately for Willis, the villain has family connections and an appetite for murder.  It's up to Willis to stop the crime, and save a young child, and evidently, satisfy his urge for genital mutilation.<br /><br />The obvious star of the film is, Merv, the character played by Mickey Roarke.  He's a beast that has hideous facial scars.  He gets his dream woman, his Goldie, who \\"smells like angles ought'ta smell\\".  Goldie gets insidiously murdered, and it soon becomes time for Merv to start his streak of revenge.  What follows is a collection humorous, albeit unbelievable, scenes that lead to the true murderer.  Heads in the toilet, torsos used as emergency brakes, faces sent several feet deep into concrete, and axes to the groin, it's only the beginning of the carnage.  Once the cannibalization and nudity starts, the movie really gets into the \\"plot\\".<br /><br />Hot women!  Tons of murder and blood!  Religion!  More nut-sack mutilation!<br /><br />Eventually the movie leads to \\"Old Town\\", a place where prostitution is rampant - replete with the gratuitous semi-nudity - and the girls dish out their own version of justice.  It's where the entire movie ties in together, and all the scenes slightly relate.  A distorted sense of good's triumph over evil serves as a conclusion to the movie, as an absolute slaughter takes place and \\"order\\" is preserved.s slightly relate.

B000BYRCH4|3.0|As I sat down to watch \\"Into the Blue\\", I knew exactly what I was in for.  There would surely be lots of ocean, lots of beautiful underwater scenery, some gorgeous fish, and a semi-coherent plot-line.  Additionally, I knew that it was a safe bet to expect plenty of the incredibly beautiful Jessica Alba in a bikini - for the guys, and a considerable amount of camera time for a shirtless Paul Walker - for the ladies.  What I didn't expect, what nobody could have possibly expected, however, was COKE ADDICTED SHARKS!  Allow me explain.<br /><br />The premise of the movie starts off simply enough.  Walker is a down on his luck diver, underwater scuba instructor with a penchant for disobedience.  Basically it's \\"Fast and the Furious\\" if swimming replaces the driving.  His girlfriend, Alba, is an instructor at what looks like a SeaWorld rip-off, and inexplicably is with the guy who has no money or possessions.  So, right off the bat, all viewers can easily place this movie into the fiction category.  They are \\"in love\\" despite their meager incomes and the fact that they are scraping by in the world.  Walker, however, has dreams of striking it rich by finding treasure in the ocean, despite the fact that he's a borderline homeless guy that still gets to sleep with Jessica Alba.  The plot thickens...<br /><br />Upon eventually finding his buried treasure, a ship called the Zephyr, he and a few friends also happen upon a crashed/sunken airplane filled with tons of cocaine.  They debate about using the drugs to fund their treasure finding expeditions, something they can't do presently because of their impoverished state.  After mulling it over time and again, arguing and pondering the ramifications of illegal drug trafficking, they inevitably get involved.  And this, my friends, is where it gets good.<br /><br />There are numerous diving scenes where Alba and Walker, although it's hard to notice Walker with Alba swimming around, go down for the treasure and drugs.  Unfortunately for the divers, but incredibly fortunate for the viewers, some of the cocaine packing gets a little loose.  Sure enough, it's turned the entire ocean into a big swimming cokehead convention.  Sharks have bloodshot eyes; fish are fidgeting as they swim by, and the manta rays are pimping themselves for some unknown reason.<br /><br />What follows is a combination of \\"Jaws\\", \\"Cool Runnings\\", every episode of the original \\"Star Trek\\", and a smidge Scooby Doo antics.  Sharks eat people; Jamaicans are rampant; the sole, inconsequential character from the Alba and Walker crew dies, and there is a ridiculously convoluted and complicated trap set up to catch the bad guys.  Bad guys lose/die; good guys win.<br /><br />The movie in and of itself is worthwhile.  I don't feel like I wasted my money.  What needs to be made clear, however, is that this movie took the next step.  They breached a horizon that has never been previously approached.  The touched upon a concept with unfathomable possibilities: COCAINE ADDICTED SHARKS!  Think about the possibilities; really, think about it.  Tell me you can't think of another 10 movies with animals addicted to drugs as the major factor in any one of the rising action, climax, falling action, or denouement.<br /><br />What a great friggin' idea.unately for the divers, but incredibly fortunate for the viewers, some of the cocaine packing gets a little loose.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I hadn't watched Firefly and so, I came into this film with no knowledge of the characters or universe they inhabited. For those who do not know, Serenity takes the characters of Firefly and slightly rewrites their story to create this movie. It's a fantastic creation, full of witty dialogue, perfectly timed lines and action, and a fully developed cast that you somehow feel you already know. Perhaps one advantage of having come from a series is that the chemistry between the actors definitely shows, and it's obvious they know exactly who they are playing.  <br /> <br />Great film, and a good introduction to the (unfortunately) short-lived series.
0385513755|1.0|I read this book because my ex bought it and raved about the greatness of Dan Brown. I read the book, out of boredom, I am a reader it is what I do, I read anything and everything. The only thing this book is good for is a door stop. The writing was bland, dry, and the story line predicatable. He took certain \\"facts\\" threw it in a bag mixed it all around and poofy, you have before you \\"The Davinci Code.\\" It was so awful I had to run to look at an Agatha Christie, at David Eddings, anything to erase what I had just read. My advice, do not read it, just pick up another book, any book, and not one written by him. I am still wondering how he, a terrible writer, got published. The publishing industry, thus far, has shown they have lowered thier standards as of late!!

It is a real, harsh glimpse into the world of addiction.<br /><br />According to James, addiction is not a disease, but a choice people make every single day of their lives. Claiming that addiction is a disease gives the addict a way to blame everyone but himself for his problems. James rejects this notion and choses life after an extremely trying stay in a rehab with hardened addicts just like himself.<br /><br />This novel hit very close to home for me as my brother is an alcoholic who will probably never, ever recover.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|This review is done from a psychological/mythological perspective and highlights symbolic material in the tradition of Jungian research into the collective unconscious.<br /><br />The opening shot of the film shows a rickety shambles of a door which slowly creaks open.  An elderly man turns to look at the door and sees a tall, lean, hollow-faced gunman--the gun and bullets are framed first in the shot and as the camera pans up to the gunman's face a ghostly rush of wind is heard.  The elderly man turns to look and sees two other men framed in the other two doors.  This opening moment sets the symbolic tone for the film, which is about the moment when someone transcends their normal life and becomes someone exceptional.  In this film the exceptional usually means an exceptional killer.<br /><br />The multiple doorways in this opening scene foreshadow the unholy gateway pictured toward the end of the film, where we learn the story behind the creation of the deadly character, Harmonica, played by Charles Bronson.  This gateway to horror is like a demonic mandala with a suffering, agonized man and child in the middle, two ominous guards standing at the sides and the Monument Valley in the background.<br /><br />Once a man has gone through that gateway of sublime disregard for human life and feeling, he becomes the gunslinger as visualized by Sergio Leone--a ghost of a man with eyes of ice and no human feeling.  Satisfaction for this man is in death and brutality; moments of ecstasy are emphasized in the mysterious soundtrack which swells to a crescendo of fulfillment and joy at the moment of confrontation with death.  Of particular note is Henry Fonda's performance.  He plays an evil man with eerie sensitivity and achieves expressions of sadistic intimacy at the moment of supreme cruelty.<br /><br />The final shot of the film closes the cycle; a woman dispensing water to numerous men of all races who are building a new town.  The giving of water by the female symbolizes restoration of the soul and the busy working men show renewed productive activity in the psyche as opposed to the stagnation and chilled repetition of violence in the beginning of the film.<br /><br />This film is one of the controversial yet classic westerns created by the master Sergio Leone.  The pace is quite slow; Leone loves to show the long stare.  The sets are beautiful and authentic.  The acting is excellent if slightly marred by the somewhat off lip-synch--it was originally filmed in parts in Italian.  The screenplay is typical Leone with psychological twists such as child abuse and oppression of women as crucial to character development.<br /><br />There is some of the signature 60's look to the film such as orange tans for the men, thick false eyelashes and mascara for the ladies.  But despite these miniscule stylistic distractions, this is one of the great Western movies, to be watched and savored.nd the busy working men show renewed productive activity in the psyche as opposed to the stagnation and chilled repetition of violence in the beginning of the film.

B000000OAL|5.0|I have no idea how the critics tossed this one aside when it came out. It is one of my all time favorite albums.  <br /> <br />This is Queen at their best in my opinion. Hard, hard rock, and long, complicated songs. After about their fifth album, they generally tossed this kind of music making aside, and went for more new wave stuff, which i thought was very unfortunate. Even though their later stuff is all good, it isn't as interesting to me as this kind of thing.  <br /> <br />This album boasts a number of excellent songs, my favorite being \\"Great King Rat\\", which has some of the best guitar work that Rock and Roll has ever seen. My other favorites are \\"Liar\\", a good hard rocker with a classic opening, \\"Doing alright\\", a beautiful ballad (originally done by Smile) that gets rough and hard at the end,  \\"The night comes down\\", with Brian may at his best in ballad writing once again, and \\"Mad the Swine\\", a silly gospel esqe song with a catchy chorus. Every other song is great too.  <br /> <br />Latter day Queen fans will definately want to give this one a listen, to see what the band was capable of in its embryonic state, but any good old hard rock fan would love this album too.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|The first time I saw this movie I did not like it at all. I had just come off of seeing the fabled A and E version of Pride and Prejudice and was expecting more of the same - pretty people in lavish costumes exchanging witty bantor in lovely houses. What I got was average looking and mostly vulgar people in a slow-moving storyline where it seemed like nothing would ever happen. It wasn't until repeated viewings that I came to appreciate the subtleties of this film, and the fact that the casting choices and even the almost agonizing pace were an absolutely perfect and right way to bring this novel to the screen. <br /> <br />For you see, the story revolves around Anne, an aging woman on the verge of spinsterhood who is quite unexpectedly thrown into the company of an old lover, Captain Wentworth. This is not some fiery attraction aka Mr Darcy and Elizabeth, but rather a slow-burning tension that both parties are trying to repress throughout the film for fear of being shot down. The acting by both leads is superb (watch for the scene when Anne sees Captain Wentworth for the first time in eight years and has to grab a chair for support). And it is lovely to see the almost-dowdy Anne slowly blossom as the film goes on. <br /> <br />And while I mentioned that overall this is not a funny piece, of course there are a few inspired Austen characters. My favorites are Anne's sister Mary, who is always supposing herself sick, and Anne's father who has some of the best lines in the movie (\\"Anne?? You want to marry ANNE? Whatever for\\"?)  <br /> <br />In conclusion, this is one of those films that grows on you, and it ultimately has a great message - it is never to late for love.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Every inch of this set is delectable, from their early stuff, to their very latest stuff. You can find almost every Zeppelin song on here, and they are all done remarkably well, some with drastically longer cuts. The version of Stariway to Heaven, as heard here, is the best version you will ever hear, and it makes the studio version look like a preview, while this one is the movie.  <br /> <br />If you have ever wanted to see Led Zeppelin \\"Thrash\\", then you are in luck; this DVD set has you covered. Watcht the first half. You will see Jimmy Page play his guitar so hard that it's hard to believe he didn't destroy it in the process.  <br /> <br />For Zep fans this is a must have. For newcomers to Led Zeppelin, I recommend first listening to thier studio stuff. Listen to every one of their albums, get to know them, and then check this out. If you see this first, then you won't appreciate it to its fullest.
B000AWYOGE|4.0|'Dark Water' is most notable simply because it actually defies expectations to some degree.  Make no mistake, it's definitely another modern ghost movie, but it takes a more character driven and more purely dramatic approach, so much so that up until the very latest portions of the film the supernatural aspects are almost a subplot.  The film is actually primarily character driven, focusing on the central Dahlia character and her daughter most of all, but still leaving plenty of room for the various minor characters.  Honestly, from a purely practical standpoint, we don't need to know these people as well as we come to, but this, along with the slow plotting of the film, helps generate a greater sense of reality and an overall expansiveness. I don't think this formula would work if it were repeated, horror films simply need to be more horrific then this as a whole, but for a lone attempt it's a fairly different, quite effective experience.<br /><br />'Dark Water' is a remake of a Hideo Nakata film from 2002. This strikes me as a peculiar film to rework, as it is a fairly effective but ultimately unremarkable film.  Also, the original 'Dark Water' has cash-in written all over it:  It's a 'Ringu' rehash directed by the maker of said film, based on a short story by Koji Suzuki, who wrote the original novel on which 'Ringu' is based.  Of course, the remake has got cash-in written all over it too, as well as the mark of the various `Ring' films: Roughly 1/3 of the plot of this film is simply recycled from `Ring/Ringu' while the American `Ring Two' (also directed by Nakata) lifted about a third of `Dark Water's plot.  (And, perhaps more significantly they have most of the same themes and motifs i.e. Girl-ghosts, water, motherhood etc.)  Still, `Dark Water' manages to seem far less reiterative simply by reworking the focus, downplaying the supernatural and emphasizing the human.<br /><br /> The film opens with a meeting between Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) and her soon to be ex husband Kyle (Dougray Scott).  It's hard to think of any divorce being to pleasant, but things are obviously bound to get prett tough here.  This separation means that Dahlia needs to find a new home, and shortly after this meeting she and her 6 year old daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade) move into a nasty, ultra-bland and rundown apartment complex on Roosevelt Island.  (My brother said this place reminded him of the Soviet built apartments he'd seen in Russia and you can totally imagine that; it's designed to be purely functional and not aesthetically pleasing, though it frankly is something of a failure in the former respect as well.)  This place has got a load of problems, the most disturbing one being the dark, viscous looking water leaking from the ceiling, and strange sound emanate from the supposedly empty apartment above.<br /><br />The film essentially follows the day to day life of Dahlia and Ceci, as things get increasingly weird and difficult:  Ceci soon acquires an imaginary friend whom she vehemently insists is real; Dahlia, who  has an ill-defined history of mental illness, begins to have disturbing dreams and to hear distant voices;  the divorce grows increasingly hostile and Dahlia suspects Kyle is trying to maker her look paranoid, all while the apartment continues to fall apart around them.  This all eventually comes to a head, but not until the final half hour, and I'm sure plenty of people will  lose patience with it.  It kept me interested, though, through the fine performances and stylish direction.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly is the center of the film, and she does a fine job.  Salles wisely refuses to turn her into a saint, allowing her to be fairly flawed and human, and ultimately more sympathetic.  Ariel Gade is your typical cute Hollywood kid, but what can I say, she's legitimately cute and the bonding scenes between her and Connelly seem very real.  There are also three fine supporting roles from Pete Postelthwaite, John C. Reilly and Tim Roth.  Reilly is the best of them as the total sleaze ball owner of the complex.  He spends the whole film endlessly praising the wretched apartments and dodging Dahlia's complaints.  I couldn't help but like him a little; sure he's slime, but it's his job and he's good at it.  Pete Postelthwaite plays his standard role, the funny-looking foreigner.  He's Veeck, the apartment caretaker something, and Postelthwaite makes him a more interesting character than he has any right to be.  Tim Roth is perhaps the most inexplicable of all of them as Dahlia's lawyer Jeff Platzer.  He takes an odd personal interest in Dahlia's life, yet lies to her constantly for no apparent reason.  One can't help but suspect that he has a romantic in her (I mean who wouldn't, ehh [nudgenudge].... even if she is crazy, so what....) but this doesn't go anywhere.  Anyway, this film is a real testament to how committed acting can bring life and significance to minor roles.<br /><br />This is an extraordinarily depressing looking film, filled with perpetual rain and a color palette extending from dirty brown to rust red.  Roosevelt island is just such a great locale as it is a total industrial wasteland.  It's a block from `Eraserhead' somehow made real.  The film is shot fairly elegantly, though the camerawork and staging are generally fairly unobtrusive.  One major exception to this rule are the dream sequences, which have a bit of flair and choppy editing, alongside some neat effects, like melting walls and whatnot.  Again, the ghostly stuff is fairly by the book, but it's sharply executed.  The climax is somewhat underwhelming but perhaps this is appropriate considering the low-key flavor of the film.  The denouemont is too heavy handed, but it's not that big of deal.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a fairly interesting, well-executed movie.  It's not liable to blow you away, but it's interesting and immersive.  Definitely worth a look if you're into this kinda thing.<br /><br />Grade: Bly and Tim Roth.

B00005JP4U|5.0|I have long been interested in global climate studies and have many atlases from over the years. Many of them have emphasized about the possibilities of global warming that is taking place since the end of World War II. The topic has gone off and on for decades now but has been in the background until just recently with the most active and destructive hurricane season in 2005 with the entire Roman alphabet name being exhausted and resorting to the Greek Alphabet. There were 27 named tropical storms in 2005, the first time that any season saw it's entire English list exhausted. Not only that, but a record five names were retired from the hurricane naming list: Dennis, Emily, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma! Many environmentalists have contributed the record number of deadly hurricanes to the warming of the planet's oceans.<br /><br /> This documentary by director David Guggenheim and by former vice president and presidential candidate Al Gore entitled \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" is a much more detailed and far more gripping documentary about his knowledge of global climate systems and how all of the world's weather systems are interconnected. Al Gore has been active in the environmental movement for more than thirty years and studied global warming from high school onwards. Gore himself has said that all of the data that he has gotten from all sources on the changing climate due to global warming is completely irrefutable. A panel of 928 global climate experts were interviewed on whether global warming is happening or not and the percentage of those 928 who disagreed with global warming actually happening was a dead zero! Out of 928, not one disagreed that global warming is happening and we're feeling the effects of it.<br /><br /> The most terrifying part of this documentary was the part about the icecaps of Antarctica and the North Pole breaking apart and I actually remember the news about a large chuck of an ice shelf larger than Rhode Island actually breaking off the Antarctic Ice Shelf and out into the Atlantic Ocean. The ultimate frightening part was the graphic simulations of what would happen if the Earths ocean levels would rise as a result of unmitigated global warming. The map of Florida as well as other coastal areas worldwide would have to be completely redrawn. Say goodbye to much of Florida, New York City, London, Shanghai, and much of Bangladesh. Already, the peoples of entire nations have been blaming America for it's arrogant hostility towards the Kyoto treaty yet even there, hundreds of cities have been taking action to reduce their pollutants in their areas.<br /><br /> For obvious reasons, the cause of a lot of this is not by natural cycles in warming and cooling of the planet because while carbon in the atmosphere has fluctuated in ups and downs, the latest increase in carbon emissions is unprecedented. Two prime causes of all of this are the high number of coal-fired power plants as well as the high number of cars and trucks that still are built from outdated technology. \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" it surely is. The high number of automobiles in relation to the population is the main reason, along with lack of political will to change, why the United States remains by far the worst contributor to carbon dioxide emissions. Yet we have the wisdom, the technology and the ability to actually take steps to retool our economy, refurbish our infrastructure, make our homes more energy efficient, as well as wean ourselves off excessive petroleum and coal consumption and reverse the skyrocketing level of CO2 emissions.<br /><br /> Al Gore himself has done many lectures at many of the world's major cities from Beijing, Berlin, Chicago, Paris, London, Moscow, Los Angeles, San Diego, Shanghai, and countless others. His knowledge convinced him to give warning about the devastating consequences of unrestrained CO2 emissions as well as the hope and knowledge to actually reverse this increase in greenhouse gases. I already have startedthis by not having a car. Sure it's inconvenient but walking while taking much longer has inspired me to live more in tune with my surroundings more.<br /><br /> A major argument that I was very much in agreement with was that our automobile industry's decline is mostly due to the fact that both Ford and General Motors continue to produce cars and trucks that have very obsolete engines that use up an unnecessary amount of fuel to drive while Japanese automakers Honda, Toyota have taken action and have been building cars that have far, FAR better gas mileage and because of this, Honda, and Toyota continue to enjoy relatively healthy sales and their fortunes continue to improve while American automakers Ford and General Motors due to not improving fuel efficiency have suffered enormously.<br /><br /> In the end, it has some great steps, a good number of which I've long been aware of but yet found very inspiring nonetheless. None of them are necessarily things that can be done overnight but they are still very simple and actually fun to do. Even if one's political views are a whole world away, I strongly recommend that EVERYONE go and see \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" right away! There's so much that needs to be done and for those who feel that there is no way to reduce their contributions to this problem, \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" will give them the knowledge and steps to take to change for the better. It is not necessarily a documentary to bring despair but instead warn about doing nothing but also being able to open the eyes of those who have yet to see the consequences of their actions in relation to the environment.<br /><br /> Go and see \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" right away!

0786915749|3.0|I was not very impressed by this book. It is fantasy, sure... but it is simply not original. The story is predictable and the characters are the same old stereotype, cut and paste characters you get in every other mainstream fantasy novel. <br /> <br />I suppose I should have expected this since Dragonlance is a RPG-based story and therefore follows a certain recipe, but I was still disappointed. I mean, the world of Dragonlance has grown to an unbelievable size - surely there must be something great about it? Well there isn't, it is pretty average. Not bad, I didn't say that. The Dragonlance chronicles is still a worthy fantasy book to read, but I will not go beyond the first 3 books. Once you've read these, I believe you will have a clear concept of Krynn. If you liked what you saw, read some more of the other 90 or something Dragonlance books. If however you feel like me, call it a closed chapter and move on to greener grounds.

1581806574|4.0|As far as drawing can go, this has to be one of the most helpful books out there. I must admit that I am a dragon-obsessed freak, but you don't have to like dragons or fantasy art in order to like this book.       To start off, Neondragon's book is perfectly organized. It's divided into four sections, basics, how to draw dragons, how to draw various details, such as horns and frills, and last we've got the other fantasy creatures. Everything starts out simple and easy, progressively moving on to harder and harder subjects. For example, at the beginning we work on a basic dragon, then we learn how to draw paws, talons, heads, and wings, until you finish off with a western (the kind that has wings and breathes fire) and eastern (the Chinese and Japanese type) dragon. This shows that, instead of jumping all over the place and drawing like there's no tommorow, you get the hang of things before you tackle complicated poses and parts.       So what about the section about making the dragon look unique? Neondragon really includes a lot about making your dragon good, so that you don't have just another winged lizard on your hands. You can learn to draw differant types of horns, scales, tails, and frills. Sometimes it helps to give you a little more inspiratin, and create awesome dragons that no else could ever create. In addition, it even teaches you how to draw feathers and fur for your dragon, or any of the other types of creatures found in the book.       After you've finished drawing dragons, you get to look at the other fantasy critters. You use the skills you learn from drawing dragons to draw the various beasties at the end of the book. This includes kirins (Chinese and Japanese unicorns), sea serpents, and phoenixes. This adds variety to the book, so that you can learn to create things other than dragons.       And what about the instructions? Everything is broken down into simple and easy steps. The current step is in red, while stuff that's already done is in blue. This makes it easy to tell what you have to do next, instead of searching for that tiny line that you couldn't find in other drawing books. There are also tips and tricks along the way, making it a little bit easier to draw that dragon. The only thing that may be of trouble is that it's hard to see the red line occasionally, since there are so many blue lines in the way. But there are only a few places where this happens.       And somewhere in the book, you get a look at dragon anatomy. It helps make your dragon look believable and alive. Neon makes it easy to understand that a believable creature is a better creature. And it's simple to make it look believable. It tells you how you can make your dragon or fantasy creature to look real. Plus, it explains why a creature should look believable.       If you're looking for a helpful and useful way to draw fantasy creatures, you may want to consider picking this book up.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|This is a very good, explosive, fascinating, and exciting movie.  It really brings the real life about the global oil industry.  For the story, it is so fascinating and everything is connected to each other without any plot/scene, which doesn't make sense for the whole movie.  So, this story is well done.  For the acting, George Clooney and Matt Damon are awesome actors for this thriller.  Others are also okay and fit for this movie.  For the direction, they are just great in all.  All the plot and scene are good from head to toe.  For the visuals, it is good because this action-packed movie always needs a good \\"letterbox\\" widescreen vision to fit the excitement.  For the music, very tense and a job well done.  This is as the same as the sound effects too.  Overall, it is simply a recommended film.

0345357116|5.0|found Unfinished Tales to be a pretty good book. It is more piecemeal than the completed novels, The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion, which was in progress when J.R.R. Tolkien died. The Silmarillion was pulled together and edited by his son Christopher.<br /><br />The book is separated into four sections. The first section is the First Age and contains stories on the coming of Tuor to Gondolin and the tale of Hurin's Children. The Tale of Hurin's children in touched on in the Silmarillion but this story is much more in-depth and while fans of the Tolkien mythologies know is a tragic tale this version is most complete.<br /><br />The second section of the book is the Second Age and focuses much on the Numenor. There is a description of the island of Numenor. This section contains the tale of the Mariner's Wife, which is another great and tragic story among the tales of Middle-Earth. There is a section on various kings of Numenor and a History of Galadriel and Celeborn. I found the history of Galadriel very interesting, and full of information that made events in later tales more meaningful<br /><br />The third section of Unfinished Tales is the Third Age. This portion of the book contains: The Disaster on the Gladden Fields, a history on the relationship between Gondor and Rohan, The Quest for Erebor, a portion on the hunt for the One Ring, And the Battles of the Rods of Isen, which ultimately lead to the death of Theodred, the son of King Thoden. This section of the book had lots of additional information for fans of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbits to consume and make their enjoyment of the stories that much fuller.<br /><br />The fourth and final section of the book contains sections on the Druedain (or Wild Men), the Istari (or Wizards) and the palantiri (or seeing stones). This section was also very valuable in adding information to the Lord of the Rings. I was very fond of the story The Faithful Stone and found the history of the Wild Men more colorful than expected. My suspicions about the origin of the Istari were validated in this section of the book as well. And my understanding of the palantiri went up substantially from near zero.<br /><br />Overall I would suggest this book to any Tolkien fan after reading at least the Lord of the Rings but better to have read the Hobbit and Silmarillion to get the most out of the tales and told in Unfinished Tales. Unfortunately, the stories are unfinished and in a few cases I found myself really wanting more but that's just the way it goes.e Wild Men more colorful than expected.

B0002DB0FO|5.0|It is the greatest family drama to ever be shown on television. It has a wonderful cast who gives 110% to every episode. The scenery is breathtaking. Even though there is no such place as Everwood Colorado, it is a place you can call home, and with a family you can watch grow and enrich your lives. The writing for each episode is amazing and thought provoking. It deals with issues of everyday life plus some issues that we tend to kick under the rug.

B000040OBS|4.0|Biker gangs,teenag e sweethearts, TV stars and psycho killers are just some of the images conjured up on this unique slice of electric punk from '77.  <br /> <br />As someone properly pointed out earlier, this isn't the \\"punk\\" many would equate with The Ramones, Dead Boys, Television, et al. For there is no guitarist, bassist or drummer. In like manner, to call this a \\"techno\\" album would not do either. But this album does draw inspirations from both. Alan Vega used the word \\"punk\\" in describing his earlier gigs, when he gained infamy for sporting a leather jacket, battered jeans and a bike chain that he pummeled the walls and floors with. Some of these things ARE punk in a sense. <br /> <br />But that's beside the point. What an album this is: Two artists with limited resources or instruments, except a battered organ (originally it was in fact a Farfisa) and a whole lotta attitude create an album of raw, primitive energy. Martin Rev's homemade riffs are an overtone to Alan Vega's beat-like lyrics. While \\"Ghost Rider\\" conjures up images of motorcyclists who are \\"blazin' away,\\" \\"Rocket USA\\" is a brooding punch-out about \\"doomsday\\" amid a world of decadence: \\"It's nineteen hundred seventy seven/the whole country's doin' a fix/ It's doomsday.\\")  <br /> <br />But this isn't always menacing. With an Elvis-like crooning, \\"Cheree\\" is an absolutely gorgeous update on '50s melodies. When Vega sings \\"Cheree Cheree/my comic book fantasy/ come play with me/ I love you / I love you, baby,\\" it's actually quite moving. \\"Johnny\\" is fun little slice of rockabilly, albeit short. (What a shame!)  \\"Girl\\" is probably the one low-water mark on the album that should be avoided at all costs, unless hearing someone moan perversely into the mic is entertaining to you. <br /> <br />Then there's \\"Frankie Teardrop\\", the jarring, disturbing 10-minute epic of 20-year-old Frankie who's stuck in the seamy side of NYC with a wife and kid - a working stiff who's \\"working from 7 to 5/he's just tryin'to survive\\" but snaps and what ensues is probably one of the scariest moments in music. The first time I heard this track I was sweating and I jumped about four times. Don't listen to this late at night alone - you've been warned. (Interesting side note: Bruce Springsteen is a fan of this song, apparently it was an inspiration when recording his \\"Nebraska\\" album a few years later.)  <br /> <br />\\"Che\\" is a brooding comedown, a track that conjures up images of a TV/movie icon who meets his fate.  <br /> <br />Rev and Vega have done a few albums together since (including the understated \\"A Way of Life\\" which I own on LP believe it or not!) but this debut remains unsurpassed. If you're hesitant to listen to this because of the notoriety surrounding \\"Frankie Teardrop\\" give this a chance and play it beginning to end. You might be pleasantly surprised - I certainly was! <br /> <br />(Note: The CD version I own is an out-of-print version from Demon Records, released in the late '80s, without the bonus tracks. So I can't comment on the live tracks.)

B000005IU1|4.0|Proto-punk, hard rock, acid rock, three-chord garage anthems - it all starts here. Iggy Pop takes Jim Morrison's confrontational stance three cocky steps forward and snarls his way from start to finish. His inspiration by the Doors is obvious, and he has the same lizard charisma as Morrison, but he doesn't rip him off. Ig has his own agenda. <br /> <br />This album is a different type of acid rock - oh, it's psychedlic alright, but without the flower-power mentality. It's a monument to boredom and alienation, as best evidenced on the acid-drenched tracks like \\"1969\\" (\\"It's another year for me and you/Another year with nothin' to do\\"), \\"No Fun\\", \\"Not Right\\" and the sledgehammer blues of \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog.\\" The moody, druggy Doors-like \\"We Will Fall\\" is most effective if listened to late at night. With its slow, cult-like chanting, wah-wah overtones and somber viola at the end (courtesy of John Cale), this song would work well in a horror movie. <br /> <br />\\"No Fun\\" features Ron Asheton diving head first into guitar fuzz, and it's nothing short of brilliant, while \\"Real Cool Time\\" and \\"Little Doll\\" are yet more loud, assaultive wah-wah guiatar tracks. The Doors influence resurfaces on \\"Ann,\\" a slow number where Ig croons like Morrison before him, but gets louder and louder before shouting his way through the track. <br /> <br />This ain't the best album by the Stooges (the distinction probably goes to \\"Funhouse\\") but it's the best example of basic, primitive, three-chord garage rock. Despite its trippy sound, it's easy to see why it became a blueprint for punk rockers a few years later (The Ramones, The Dictators, Suicide, Dead Boys and the Clash all credit this band and album as an influence). Recording this might have been \\"No Fun\\" for the band but that's not the case in listening to this.
B000002J09|5.0|One thing Whirligig-You say something about the lead singer's voice and ask the asinine question \\"Is he on drugs?\\"    lemme tell you something about this time peroid. EVERYONE was on drugs. It's not that shocking. If you really are that judgemental however, lets look again at your \\"Legends\\" list. Oh Nirvana. Ohhh you're right Zeppelin's singer sounds super tripped out when you compare him to that d-bag Cobain. Every Nirvana song ever is exactly the same, with the same brain numbing and senseless groaning and moaning they try to pass off as singing. Oh and what happened to Cobain anyways? Surely he didn't die from commiting suicide (most likely inspired by drug use) now did he? Oh wait that's right, HE DID YOU FRICKING MORON. THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK. (or type) If you're so concerned about not wanting to listen to a band because they did drugs, then you have pretty much 3 1/2 christian bands left and that's it. Tough luck I guess.     P.S. This was supposed to be a continuation from another review I wrote that didn't get posted. I went back and edited it a bit to make it make more sense. The other review had more stuff to make \\"Whirligig\\" less credible but oh well I guess. (my favorite parts though were that whirligig contradicted himself in his reviews. First up, he posted multiple 1 star reviews which just makes him annoying, but here were some of his quotes. His first review said something like this \\"they only made one decent song and it's Stairway to Heaven!\\" In his other review he made a comment something like this, \\"They only made one decent song and it's Kashmir!\\" Does this sound like a person who knows what he's talking about? I think not. It is also my personal opinion that whriligig rates good bands badly out of spite. He left a 1 star review on an ACDC album as well, because they \\"scream too much,\\" (similar to what he did here) but then he went as far as to leave a 4 or 5 star review on a Guns N Roses album. Axl Rose sounds almost identical to the singer ofACDC-they both have really weird \\"singing\\" voices. Don't get me wrong, I like both bands, but I just found it a little strange how he can type something like \\"they scream too much,\\" but enjoy a band that does the same thing. He does a similar thing by rating Aerosmith at a 4 or 5, and it's my opinion that The lead singer of Aerosmith sounds a LITTLE similar to Robert Plant, yet he has a huge problem with Plant's singing (Recap- \\"Is he on drugs?!\\")    I also had a bit on the album, which I'll retype now. I haven't heard everything on this album, but I do enjoy Zeppelin songs. I can't name that many, but the ones I can are my favorites.(immigrant song, kashmir, stairway-but it's overplayed) I've heard others that I really like, I just forgot titles.     The last part of my other review dealt with all music reviews in general. Everyone has different taste in music, so it's not really something that can be recommended. There's no guarantee that you'll enjoy this cd, and there's no guarantee that you won't. You have to take a chance and buy it-who knows, maybe you'll find something you really like.    Just my thoughts...
1577311523|5.0|If you are ready to acknowledge the very straightforward (though somewhat non-intuitive) concepts in this book, it could be the most transformative teaching of your life.  It has been for me.  I HIGHLY recommend listening to the audio version (CD, tapes or Audible MP3), as Tolle is truly living the experience and his voice communicates in ways that simple words never could.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I have enjoyed Mark Knopfler's slant on life since the days of \\"I want my MTV\\". In recent years he has mellowed some but his insight has not. Like Shangri-La, gone are the big riffs of the Dire Straits days but that still doesn't diminish his now more subtle guitar work. I like Emmy Lou Harris & their voices are a good match. Starting with \\"Beachcombing\\"(Which, like most of Knopfler's songs, has lyrics with multiple-leveled meaning) to \\"If this is goodbye\\", there isn't a bad track on the CD. My favorite..\\"Beyond my wildest dreams\\". Like the trucker,I travel.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This is a master work, if only because the director Roman Polanski makes us see through the eyes and fate of a single victim the horror of the Nazi murder of the Jews of Poland. The scenes of destruction are heartrending and harrowing. And the picture given of loneliness among the ruins and devastation is desolation complete.<br /><br />Ironically , the survival of the protagonist and his returning to play once again the classical music he loves in post- war Poland ( Accurately reflecting the actual story of Spilman as chronicled  in his book) seems oddly out of keeping , almost perversely optimistic in relation to the nighmare destruction of a whole people that we have seen before.
B000066744|5.0|This is one of my most favorite movie especially in music. The music played in this movie are amazing with classical and Jazz music; Ennio Morricone and Amedeo Tommasi composed some great pieces in this one with some very lovely and intimate songs like Playing Love, Magic Waltz, Danny Blues & A Mozart Reincarnated (similar to Mozart's Piano Sonata No 11 in A Major K331 &lt;same song played in Jet Li's Unleased, which is also a great meaningful movie with the theme of \\"Music Saves Lives\\">). You have to buy the sound track and enjoy the music (recommend buying the Italian version because it has more songs). Anyway, the movie is quiet buy very nice; kind of sad at the end but a person who truly understands art wont mind sadness as much. This movie also introduces the Jazz legend Jelly Roll Morton with some of his very awesome songs like the Crave and Fingerbreaker. This movie really got me interested in Jazz piano. Tim Roth, the main charater, performed a great role in this movie; one of his best. He also fakes playing the piano really well. I heard that it took him 6 months to learn how to fake playing piano. Great movie!!! Buy it if you love classical or jazz music. Buy it still if you like a good story.
B00000IQV7|4.0|This movie is another reason why Mr. Williams is a great actor. Nice love story, death story and an inspiring ending. A must have or at least see for all.
B00005M91K|5.0|Fantastic, inspirational. The film makes you realise what an amazing place the world is & how much we should all try to see as much of it as possible. The music is perfect for the images & the photography is breathtaking. Enjoy
B00005N5S5|4.0|I am not of the age to have been able to see this at the box office but I indeed bought this to learn of the beginning of the trilogy that arose from this sci-fi thriller. A little comical because Mr. Schwarzenegger was a little bit different than in the films following this release. Great now I know how it all began. Cannot wait until it continues...come on T4..
B000050L6Z|4.0|I am writing this as I am listening to an original vinyl pressing.  In all my drunken and drugged up debauchery of  <br />the late 70's and through the 80's, I managed to keep some  <br />classic releases in pristine condition.  I popped on  <br />\\"Outlandos d'Amour\\" because I have been reminiscent lately. <br />This one is definitely a \\"play-all-the-way\\" from the start <br />of side one to the end of side two.  The only weak track I  <br />would say is \\"Be My Girl - Sally\\".  The first time I heard it <br />whatever I was drinking at the time came up through my nose. <br />After that, the novelty wore off, and by comparison to  <br />today's standards the content of the poem is quite tame even <br />to the point of \\"Oh, puh-leez skip that track!\\"  Without it <br />\\"Outlandous\\" would be a 5/5 for sure! <br /> <br />The Police may have looked \\"punk\\" but were far from it.  I  <br />wouldn't be surprised if The Police [if not created] were  <br />molded to make this \\"New Wave\\" music of the late 1970's more <br />palatable to the record buying masses.  Those of us that bought <br />this album were given strange looks by our long-haired <br />heavy metal Led Zeppelin/Aerosmith listening friends.  \\"What,  <br />are you becoming a punk?!?!\\" we were asked.  \\"Well, no, this is <br />great album and I think you should give it a listen.\\"  Many <br />were \\"converted\\"; none regretted it. <br /> <br />In Toronto, Ontario, Canada in '81, '82 and '83, we were <br />graced with \\"The Police Picnic\\".  I can still remember how odd <br />it felt hearing and seeing some 35,000 people singing \\"So Lonely\\". <br /> <br />The whole day was a multicultural music-fest. <br /> <br /> <br />I also remember the grief the audience gave James Brown, and yep, <br />we BOO'ed Joan Jett off stage.
1400031524|4.0|This is the second novel (I think) about Swedish police Inspector Kurt Wallender, and the third one I have read, and it's by far the most harrowing. Wallender is going about his business in Ystad, on the far southern coast, when a report comes in about a life raft that was washed ashore nearby with two well-dressed corpses in it. The investigation leads back to Riga, capital of Latvia, on the other side of the Baltic from Scandinavia, and the always overworked Swedish police are relieved when the case and the corpses can be turned over to the Riga police. But a Latvian police major who had come to Ystad to sort things out is killed the same day he returns home, and Wallender's assistance is requested in Riga in order to solve the murder. Of course, 1991 was a time of great turmoil in the Baltic states, as it was everywhere in the collapsing Soviet empire, and Wallender finds himself caught up in the nascent Latvian independence movement -- and also emotionally involved with the late major's widow, Baiba Liepa. Wallender is not, in his own mind, an especially courageous man; he'd rather be investigating bank frauds, he thinks, than mucking about in political killings. But even he makes numerous human errors, he acquits himself very well. He'll never really understand Latvia, though. At one point, he inquires of a high-ranking Latvian cop what the penalty would be for the murderer, if they were able to catch him. \\"I would expect him to be shot,\\" he's told. \\"Personally, I think that would be an appropriate punishment.\\" Wallender is speechless. \\"That he was in a country where they executed criminals was so horrific that he was rendered temporarily speechless.\\" (I wonder what Wallender would think about American judicial customs?) Mankell, who admits he knows probably less about Latvian politics than even Wallender, probably would do better to stick with pure cop/detective plots, rather than edging over into quasi-spy stories. Nevertheless, he paints a vivid portrait of a gray country and society at a turning point in its history.a gray country and society at a turning point in its history.
0689865384|5.0|I very much enjoyed all 3 of the books in the series. Each is certainly a page-turner in its own right. This is coming from someone who doesn't care for fiction. But more than enjoyable reading, this is possibly the best work of dystopia ever written - better than '1984', better than 'Brave New World', and better than 'Fahrenheit 451'. Westerfield presents his razor-sharp critiques of our society and what it could well become thanks to our obsession with beauty at any cost, woven in prose that is rich but never florid. He is a master of suspense - even if I didn't always feel the characters' emotions, there was always a surprise within a few pages. And in the end, all his points were made magnificently. A trilogy may be too much material to change the paradigms of Western society, but this series should be required reading in high schools.
0780631684|4.0|A friend recommended this as \\"the best teen horror flick of recent years\\" -- and considering that most in the genre rate about a \\"two\\" on a scale of ten, this one is pretty good. Alex and his high school class are boarding the plane for a trip to Paris when he dozes off and has a vision of the plane going up in a fireball. Naturally, he freaks out and gets tossed off the plane, together with five of his classmates and a teacher. While they're arguing with security, the plane takes off and immediately explodes. But Death (or Fate, or whatever) doesn't like being cheated and institutes collection proceedings on the little group of survivors. One is taken out by a speeding truck, but most of the others are the victims of almost Rube-Goldberg-ish lethal ingenuity. Actually, there's quite a bit of old-horror-movie-type atmosphere here, plus a good soundtrack. And the closing shot is a killer.
B00005K3OT|5.0|It was a very wonderful movie with a great cast. The message was clear and brought to life by a magnificant script. It would be worth buying and adding to you DVD collection. Plus any movie,with Johnny Depp, is an A in my eyes. ***************
B000BBOUU4|3.0|It isn't a new thing to see Johnny Depp surrounded by chocolate (Chocolat), or for him to act for director Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood). Neither it is a new thing to make a film adaption of Roald Dahl's \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" (there's the 1971 version starring Gene Wilder). Still, in the previews it did look like it was going to be a treat. It wasn't as sweet as I'd hoped though.    Charlie (Freddie Highmore) is a poor but good hearted child, and he, his parents, and his four grandparents, all live together in a crooked old house. Charlie's a creative child, he uses toothpaste tubes from his father's work to build a model chocolate factory. He wishes he could visit the town's real one, owned by the eccentric Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp).  Charlie's wish comes true when he finds a golden ticket in a chocolate bar, which invites him to the factory. Taking his Grampa Joe (David Kelly) with him, Charlie meets Willy and goes with him, along with four, less good natured children into the wonderous world of the factory. They'll discover a chocolate waterfall, three - course meal chewing gum, the Oompa - Loompas (all played by Deep Roy) and the incredible glass elevator.     I like the design of the film, and I love the colour scheme. Its rich like chocolate. I remember seeing the posters a couple of months before the film came out: Augustus' blonde hair, powdery pink face and bright blue eyes, and it was really evocative. In some shots it almost has a colorized feel. I also like the look of the factory, the casting of the children (which I think was perfect) and the fact you get to see them after their comeuppance. I like the look of Depp's Wonka and for the most part, I like Depp's perfomance too. Reminded me a little of his performance as Ed Wood, in terms of enthusiasm, but more child-like and neurotic.     However, I didn't like the more selfish side to Depp's character. He doesn't particularly like children or family for most of the film, and israther impatient at times, and his friendliness is often forced. Gene Wilder's Wonka was a awe-inspiring but friendly, lonely man. Watching the 1971 version as a child, you wanted to go to the factory, not just to eat the amazing candies, but to meet the man. If I was a child now, I wouldn't know what to make of Depp's Wonka's selfish side. He doesn't really want anyone in his factory. He just wants to show it off! This is rather different from the book, which Tim Burton claims to be trying to be faithful to.    Another difference from the book is an inclusion of a backstory to Willy Wonka. It turns out his father was ironically a rather intimidating dentist who wouldn't let him eat candy, played by none other than Christopher Lee, a man whose roles have included Dracula, Fu Manchu, Count Dooku, Sauruman and the voice of Discworld's Grim Reaper. Now I love Christopher Lee, I really, really do, but his appearance in this film seems to me to be just for appearance's sake, just because he's experiencing a resurgence of popularity after \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\".     Due to the addition of this backstory, there are a series of flashbacks interdispersed throughout the film. The backstory is very Tim Burton. Willy is an outsider as a child, and with his mouth and head full of wires, he's kind of a freak. The flashbacks have a kind of \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" vibe. Though its not in the book, I can see Dahl making Wonka's father a dentist if he had felt like elaborating in that direction, and I wouldn't have minded this backstory so much if it hadn't been for the consequences it has on the ending, which I found disappointing.    The Oompa Loompas annoyed me also. I like Deep Roy, but there was just too much (or should that be \\"too many\\") of him in this film. The songs, penned, pitch shifted and sung by Danny Elfman (with lyrics from the Roald Dahl poems of the original novel), irritated me for the most part too. Just kind of tacky sounding, I felt. I did like the Beatle-esque song for Veruca Salt's exit though.    The DVD is very well put together, capturing the spacious, colourful, odd world of Wonka's chocolate factory within the menus. Special features on the DVD include a selection of featurettes, including one about the squirrels (live, animatronic and otherwise), one about Deep Roy and his role(s) as an Oompa-Loompa, as well as an interesting documentary on Roald Dahl. There are also a few games for the viewer to play, such as making your own candy concoction and getting the poor Oompa - Loompa to try it. You can get some pretty funny results. There is also a game called \\"Find the Golden Ticket\\" that involves playing each of the children, trying to get their golden ticket. Charlie's game is a point and click style of game where you have to find various odds and ends (like money for a chocolate bar). Veruca's game sees you sorting boxes. You get to feed Augustus in his game. Mike's game is probably the hardest. There is a tangle of highways, and you have to figure out which one the truck will go to. Once you beat all of these children's games, you are rewarded with an animatic (rough computer animated storyboard) of the \\"Augustus Gloop\\" song with all the Deep Roy Oompas. Some of those games were hard (particulary Mike's level), and I didn't think this animatic was much of a reward! With the first Harry Potter film, you get seven deleted scenes for completing the main menu game, and that game was a fair bit easier than this one!    Speaking of games, if you have a DVD ROM drive on your PC, you will be treated to a demo of the \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" video game, which is kind of fun.    It's all worth a look, but I definitely prefer 1971 film.
0765348780|4.0|Gardens of the Moon is the first book in what looks like its going to be a several book series.  I've seen the book on Amazon and in bookstores, but there was something about the cover art that turned me off.  Too realistic or something, not entirely sure.<br /><br />Regardless, the story was enthralling after about a third of the way in!  The author introduces a signficant number of characters in a short period of time and it took a while before I could start piecing the threads and getting involved in the story.  In short, it took a while for me to care, but I hung in there.<br /><br />The book definitely has a Eberron-esque flair to it (except for the blackpowder munitions) which I finally was able to get immersed in.<br /><br />While the book is followed up by another in the series it can really stand on its own.<br /><br />Its comparative work to George R. R. Martin's,  A Song of Fire and Ice, or Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series
0679422714|2.0|I stopped reading at about pg 300 as I began to suspect that what I was reading was more of a screed than a biography.  While I have no doubt that Mao was a murdering, incompetent butcher - it's hardly a debatable observation and was of course a well-known fact before this book came along - I just got the feeling that there was a pseudo-religious zeal in these authors' portrayal of everything Mao ever did as evil, corrupt, ineffective at best and disastrous more often than not.  They get their foot on Mao's throat on Page 1 and don't let up.  Now while he might deserve it, I just never got the sense that what the authors were saying was necessarily totally accurate.  And it's a very long book to read if you have doubts about the authors' intent and factual honesty.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|The hetero musical chairs pairing of the two couples seemed to me to be a lot of sublimation over the fact that the true passion in the movie (and the only passion that came across effectively on screen) was that of the two men for each other. <br /> <br />The two men also \\"met cute,\\" one pretending to be a woman in an internet chat room asking the other how big his \\"endowment,\\" and the other, in his haste to dodge work-related phone calls (after all, he was on his computer at work), couldn't type fast enough and claimed to possess over 9 pounds of manliness! <br /> <br />They enjoyed nothing more than taunting each other with tales of conquests of the other's (however temporary) female love interest. <br /> <br />I truly expected them to have a \\"Brokeback\\" moment but, then again, it was a Mike Nichols script! <br /> <br />
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|While film looks and sounds amazing, the plot is mediocre at best. Fun to watch, but would be boring for those not familiar with Final Fantasy VII.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I rate this movie 5 stars, or 9,5/10. This is one of the 100 Best America movies of All Times (#71 to be more exact) and it is included in the 1000 Best Movies in DVD by Peter Travers. The movie won 6 Oscars, including Best Director for Robert Zemeckis (\\"Back to the Future\\"), Picture, and Actor (Tom Hanks speech went like this: \\"If Forrest Gump was here tonight he'd say: \\"I went to the Academy Awards AGAIN, and they gave me the Oscar AGAIN!\\" making reference at his Oscar for Philadelphia the previous year), and Best Effects (there is a great documentary on that in the second DVD on this edition), Best Film Editing, and Best Writing based on Material from Another Medium. Special mention deserves the music on the film, going over most of the hits of the late 50's and the 60's. So if you like R'n'R, go and buy the Soundtrack as well!<br /><br />The movie depicts the story of Forrest Gump, a mentally retarded kid who makes it to the top. That can be understood in, at least, two different ways: 1. Any mentally retarded can do good in America. 2. America is the land of opportunity where anybody who tries hard can make it. But this is a movie, a very good movie. So it's a piece of entertainment, and I just watched the movie today (I just watched a couple of times when I came out 12 years ago), and I had a lot of fun. As an example, when Gump goes to the Army, he is very good just following orders, not even thinking about it, so his Sargent tells him \\"You must have an IQ of 160!\\". That, in my opinion, is really funny, and a very witty critic to the Army, where all they need is \\"robots\\" who can just obey without even thinking. There is also something remarkable. When Forrest Gump comes back from Vietnam, he happens to be at Washington D.C., where there is a huge demonstration against the War. The city is taken by hippies and pacifists. Jenny, the woman of his dreams, is there. They meet. And her boyfriend smashes her in fornt of him. Forrest Gump, the \\"baby-killer\\" from Vietnam, as he is called, defends her violently. But it's obvious that the guy who is a \\"pacifist\\" was using violence with her, using bad language and in acts. That is nothing put there by chance. It has a meaning. There was violence in Vietnam, in the war, at home, by the police, but also by the protesters. And that is something that has rarely been told. They were using drugs to \\"liberate\\" themselves, but that was -in my opinion- another violent way to express themselves. There are a lot of details like that in the movie, that no one could miss. For instance, when the mother of Forrest Gump tries to enroll him at a Regular Elementary school, the Principal is trying to explain her that Forrest's IQ is below normal, and that he should be going to a special school (there was no inclusion at that time). The mother thinks Forrest should have the same opportunities as anybody else, so she offers herself to do \\"anything\\" possible to allow Forrest to go to a regular school. And the Principal takes advantage of her. That is another very intelligent critic to things that, unfortunately, are still happening today. Another thing is when Forrest goes to college. Once he graduates, he tells us in plain English \\"After 5 years playing football, they gave me a degree\\". So, after 5 years doing nothing, I graduated anyway. Does it sound famiiar? Read between the lines!<br /><br />To end with this review, I will just say that this is a GREAT movie, very entertaining, well done (the sound in the war scenes is just superb!), a pleasure to watch, with a lot of fun moments, some tender ones, and it tells us a little bit about the history of the US from the 50's to the 80's. It's not that \\"retarded\\". It is a very witti one, and it deserves the place it made in the History of Cinema. This is a special edition with 2 DVD's, very CHEAP and highly recommended.

0316172324|5.0|This book is captivating and a quick read, but the ideas contained in it are quite deep.  This book is actually a lot more nuanced than many of the other reviewers suggest: instead of making broad generalizations, the author describes different types of situations involving decisionmaking and discusses their differences. <br /> <br />I especially like the way the author explores both situations in which snap judgments can be extraordinarily accurate, and those in which they are less so.  I also like the contrast the author draws by introducing the use of data to make systematic decisions.  This discussion may be of particular use to people in operations research, management, people who run small businesses, other organizations, or political campaigns. <br /> <br />I think that most people would not only benefit from reading this book, but would enjoy it as well.  It's fun, but deep.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Man I remember when this album first came out. i couldn't stop hearing this album man it's got it all. The opening track Ambition Az A Ridah man is tight. That track was perfect for an opener. All About U featuring Nate Dogg another Pac classic, and my favorite on here is Shorty Wanna Be a Thug, and All Eyez On Me. I do wish the original version of California Love was on here. Not that I don't like the remix it is tight, but I like the original version more. If you don't have this album, man you must be crazy. People who hate this album are people who think 50 snitch, Nelly, and Gay Z are the greatest rappers. I remember somebody showing me a list of great MC's on MTV.com. Man Jay Z was number one Pac was 2 and Biggie 3. They were saying stupid crap that Jay is a better rapper than Biggie and Pac. What the hell is that man. MTV is wack and only gives light to pop rap not this true real hardcore rap. Anyway people need to buy this album it's a classic. When you hear this your gonna know why so many rappers try to rip off 2pac(does '03 Bonnie and Clyde by Jay Z ring a bell). 2pac is original and one of the great MC's of all time. RIP Pac and if you are alive then make sure you slaughter all these fake thug rappers and MTV supporters.

0205313426|5.0|About twenty years ago I attended a report writing course for technical people and was given a copy of \\"The Elements of Style\\" as a guide to writing technical reports for non technical people. Over the years it has proved invaluable and when I found it was available on Amazon.com I purchased five copies, a new one for myself, one for each of my sons as they enter into their professional careers and a spare one that I will give to some deserving person when the opportunity arises.
B000EULJLU|3.0|Do you know how Tool sounds?  Rythmic and atmospheric oriented riffs?  Well, then you know what this album sounds like.  Nothing really new.  It sounds like a continuation from the last album.  If you liked the last album you'll like this one.  If you've heard the last album and that made you want to hear the album that was now two albums ago.... maybe you should keep this album in the back of your mind for one of those times when you have some extra money left on a gift card or you know, like your great aunt wants to pick something up for you because you watched her cats the weekend she went to Paris or something like that, that would be a good time to say, \\"Oh, there's this Tool album I never got that you could pick up for me.\\"  Then your aunt might say, \\"Oh you can have mine.  I only listened to it once or twice and it never caught my ear.\\"  Then you might be surprised to hear that this 70 year old imaginary lady likes Tool and you'll have something you didn't know you had in common with her.  10,000 Days does have some nice packaging though.  I'll say that.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Season 1 of Veronica Mars was by far the best season of television I've ever seen.  Season 2 was a little harder to follow, complex and spread out too much with all the hiatuses.  But when you watch it in succession and get the benefit of continuity, you see that the complex and rather confusing season was still great! <br /> <br />VM is smart, witty, sarcastic, and darkly funny all within a high school setting, though they just graduated, and high school drama is not a major part of the show.  I'm 23, so a little closer to high school than some, but I know plenty of grown women who understand the greatness of Veronica Mars!  It's the writing, the dialogue itself as well as the incredible delivery by these amazing actors, that really draws you in.  It's so intelligent and expects the audience to be as well.  Solving the mysteries is a huge draw to me, and the character development and chemistry really invests you in the show.  Without giving anything away, the end of season two was, of course, amazing.  It stepped it up for the last few episodes, just like the end of season one.  And when you don't lose the continuity in between all the episodes, you'll see it's still the best show out there.  Season one still rules the entire known universe, so buy that first, and then get your hands on season 2 quick, before season 3 starts because it's going to be an amazing season, I'm sure of it!
B01G7XJNKQ|3.0|I don't look at someone like him and think &#34;this album was colorful, but Hours is..?&#34;  He was a guy who could innovate while staying the same.  Hours has some good stuff but nothing spectacular.  Nothing after Heroes was spectacular as it had all been said more succinctly and passionately before.  But he was so musical that it doesn't matter.

0156421178|5.0|I have been interested, as a pro-Republican partisan, in the Spanish Civil War since I was a teenager.  Underlying my interests has always been a nagging question of how that struggle could have been won by the working class. The Spanish proletariat certainly was capable of both heroic action and the ability to create organizations that reflected its own class interests i.e. the worker militias and factory committees. Of all modern working class revolutions after the Russian revolution Spain showed the most promise of success. Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky noted that the political class consciousness of the Spanish proletariat was higher than that of the Russian proletariat in 1917. George Orwell's book gives some eyewitness insights into the causes of that defeat from the perspective of a political rank and file militant who fought in the trenches in a Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) militia unit during the key year 1937. Leon Trotsky in his polemical article `The Lessons of Spain-Last Warning', collected in The Spanish Revolution, 1931-39 (reviewed elsewhere in this space),  his definitive assessment of the Spanish situation in the wake of the defeat of the Barcelona uprising in May 1937, while asserting that the POUM was the most honest revolutionary party in Spain, stated that in the final analysis the approaching defeat of the revolution could be laid to the policies of the POUM. Orwell's book parallels that argument on the ground in Spain although he certainly was not a follower of Trotsky's.     Let us be clear here- we are not talking about the Orwell who later lost his political moorings and decided that the road to human progress passed through the nefarious intelligence agencies of  British imperialism. Unfortunately, many militants have traveled that road. Nor are we talking about the later author of Animal Farm and 1984 who warmed the hearts of Western Cold Warriors. We are talking about the militant George Orwell who fought as a volunteer against fascism in Spain in 1937 when it counted. That Orwell has something to say to militants. We need to listen to him if we are to make sense of the disaster in Spain.    While Homage to Catalonia is, in part, a journal of Orwell's personal experiences as a militiaman under the stress of war that part is less useful to militants today. The parts that are important are the political chapters. One should discount Orwell's self-proclaimed blasé attitude toward politics. Here is an intensely political man. Orwell draws two important conclusions from his experiences. First, the war against Franco could not be won without a simultaneous extension of the revolution to the creation of a workers state. The workers and peasants of Spain could not be persuaded to and would not and fight to the finish merely for `democracy'. This premise runs counter to the objective policies pursued by almost all the pro-Republican parties. Orwell describes very vividly the negative changes that occurred in working class morale in Barcelona, the Petrograd of Spain, during his stay.    The second conclusion Orwell draws is that the role of the Spanish Communist Party and its sponsor, the Soviet Union was not just momentarily anti-revolutionary in the interests of defeating Franco but counterrevolutionary. The Soviet Union had no interest in creating a second workers state. In the final analysis, despite providing weapons, the Soviet Union was more interested in finding allies among the European imperialist than in revolution. In long-range hindsight that seems clear but at the time it was far from obvious to militants on the ground, especially the militants of the Spanish Communist party who got caught up in the Stalinist security apparatus. Of course, this extreme shift to the right dovetailed with the  interests of the liberal Republicans. However, in the end they all had to flee.    This writer notes that at the time many European militants, like Victor Serge, and organizations ,  like the Independent Labor party in England, covered for the erroneous policies of the POUM based on their position as the most coherent, organized  and militant ostensibly revolutionary organization  in Spain. That support was at the time the subject of intense debate on the extreme left.  Fair enough. What does not make sense is that since 1991 or so under the impact of the so-called `death of communism' a virtual cottage industry has developed, centered on the British journal Revolutionary History, seeking today to justify the positions of the POUM. Jesus, can't these people learn something after all this time.       And what was the POUM. That party, partially created by cadre formerly associated with Trotsky in the Spanish Left Opposition, failed on virtually every count. They made every mistake in the revolutionary book. Those conscious mistakes from its inception included, but were not limited to, the creation of an unprincipled bloc between the former Left Oppositionists and the former Right Oppositionists (Bukharinites) of Juan Maurin to form the POUM in 1935;  political support to the Popular Front including entry into the government coalition by its leader, Andreas Nin; creation of its own small trade union federation instead of entry in the massive anarchist led-CNT to fight  for the perspective of a workers state; a willful failure to seriously expand the organization outside of Catalonia; creation of its own militia units and other institutions reflecting a hands-off attitude toward  political struggle with other parties; and, fatally, an at best equivocal role in the Barcelona uprising of 1937.  In short, at best, the POUM pursued left social democratic policies in a situation that required Bolshevik policies. Read 1937 Orwell for other insights into the POUM.

B000007S5B|4.0|Since my youth I have had an ear for roots music, whether I was conscious of that fact or not. The original of that interest first centered on the blues, then early rock and roll and later, with the folk revival of the early 1960's, folk music. I have often wondered about the source of this interest. I am, and have always been a city boy, and an Eastern city boy at that. Nevertheless, over time I have come to appreciate many more forms of roots music than in my youth. The subject of the following review is an example. <br /> <br />The Doors are roots music you ask? Yes, in the sense that one of the branches of rock and roll derives from early rythmn and blues and in the special case of Jim Morrison, leader of the Doors, the attempt to find shamanic roots in the Western American Native American culture. Some of that influence is apparent here.    <br /> <br />More than one rock critic has argued that at their best the Doors were the best rock and roll band ever created. Those critics will get no argument here. What a reviewer with that opinion has to do is determine whether any particular CD catures the Doors at their best. This album while it has some classics is not uniformly their best work. This reviewer advises that if you want to buy only one Doors CD that would be The Best of the Doors. If you want to trace their evolution this CD is fine.          <br />

B000000OQF|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever made. Buy it.
B000FA57RG|3.0|While I love some of the songs on the CD, it should have had other songs. Hollywood (remix) should not have been there. It's only an intermission song. Deeper & Deeper, Burning Up & Material Girl would have been better choices. Die Another Day & Nobody Knows Me (great songs in themselves) are pointless. They are lip-synced and add nothing to this potentially great CD. Vogue sounds amazing. Mother & Father (Didn't like it on American Life) & Lament are so emotional it sends shivers down your spine. The DVD is just ok. Like many said it only include edited performance and the CD/DVD package should have been a live Double CD.  <br /> <br />The sound quality is top notch. I think this is only for die-hard Madonna fans, not the casual listener.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|Disc 1: Jupiter <br />1.Dani California- The obvious hit here. Everything, from the beat to the thrilling Frusciante guitar solo, to even the funny music video is great. One of RHCP's best ever. <br />Score: 10 of 10 <br /> <br />2.Snow((Hey Oh))- Going to be the third single off the album, and rightfully so. Despite its mellowness, it is strangely uplifting, and you'll find yourself singing along to the catchy chorus.  <br />Score: 10 of 10 <br /> <br />3.Charlie- Very good song. One of the best on the CD. Shows that they can still play funk music well and still have a sense of humor. The lyrics confuse me, but Kiedis has a strange way of writing songs, using many pop culture references. <br />Score: 10 of 10 <br /> <br />4.Stadium Arcadium- Very beautiful song from RHCP. Probably the best ballad (It's hard to tell on many songs whether it's a ballad or not) on the album. <br />Score: 9 of 10 <br /> <br />5.Hump de Bump- Another very funky song here. While there is not much beneath the surface of this song, it is effective. <br />Score: 6 of 10 <br /> <br />6.She's Only 18- Once again, a very funky song. This has more to it than Hump de Bump, a better melody and chorus. <br />Score: 7 of 10 <br /> <br />7.Slow Cheetah- Very beautiful and catchy song, metaphorically speaking. Nah, the song is good, though. Shows RHCP's versatility. <br />Score: 8 of 10 <br /> <br />8.Torture Me- Alright! Now this, to me, is the best song on the album. The guitar playing is amazing, and it has the most effective use of a trumpet I've ever heard. Best \\"fast\\" song on the album. <br />Score: 10 of 10 <br /> <br />9.Strip My Mind- While no song on this album is \\"bad\\", this is one of the worst on the album. I don't know, but I don't think it's necessary. Still better than anything Fall Out Boy could do. Lol. <br />Score: 5 of 10 <br /> <br />10.Especially in Michigan- One of the best songs on the album. It has a great melody, and incorporates many of RHCP's skills. Very cool. <br />Score:10 of 10 <br /> <br />11.Warlocks- Filler, yes, but \\"good\\" filler. Remember, you must look at a double album over the entire sprawl, not song for song. <br />Score: 6 of 10 <br /> <br />12.C'Mon Girl- Cool fast-paced song with a catchy chorus. <br />Score: 8 of 10 <br /> <br />13. Wet Sand- Very beautiful song with a captivating ending. <br />Score: 8 of 10 <br /> <br />14.Hey- Ehh...this is give or take. And I'll take it. <br />Score: 6 of 10 <br /> <br />Disc 2: Mars <br /> <br />1.Desecration Smile- Best song on the second disc. Incorporates everything from RHCP's repatoire. One of RHCP's best. <br />Score: 10 of 10 <br /> <br />2.Tell Me Baby- Awesome song that incorporates funk and mellowness. It is the 2nd single off the album. <br />Score: 10 of 10 <br /> <br />3.Hard to Concentrate- Pretty good song. Don't know how much better to put it. <br />Score: 6 of 10 <br /> <br />4.21st Century- Very cool song, both lyrically and musically. <br />Score: 8 of 10 <br /> <br />5.She Looks to Me- Pretty good with a catchy chorus. <br />Score: 7 of 10 <br /> <br />6.Readymade- Another awesome song. This is Disc 2's Torture Me. Some amazing guitar work present. <br />Score: 10 of 10 <br /> <br />7.If- Worst song on the album. Dull and boring. <br />Score: 3 of 10 <br /> <br />8.Make You Feel Better- Didn't like it upon first listen, but it grew on me. Not the best, but it is still very solid. <br />Score: 8 of 10 <br /> <br />9.Animal Bar- One of the best. Frusciante uses Pink Floyd-like effects and it works off greatly. Awesome. <br />Score: 10 of 10 <br /> <br />10.So Much I- It's pretty good. Nothing special. <br />Score: 6 of 10 <br /> <br />11.Storm in a Teacup- Very good fast-paced song. Very catchy, and it actually feels like a STORM!!!......in a teacup. Yeah. <br />Score: 9 of 10 <br /> <br />12.We Believe- Pretty catchy (That describes like every RHCP song). <br />Score: 6 of 10 <br /> <br />13.Turn It Again- Great song. Very cool with a fast and catchy chorus. <br />Score: 9 of 10 <br /> <br />14.Death of a Martian- Give or take. I like the ending, however. <br />Score: 6 of 10 <br /> <br />Track picks: Dani California <br />             Snow((Hey Oh)) <br />             Charlie <br />             Torture Me <br />             Especially in Michigan <br />             Desecration Smile <br />             Tell Me Baby <br />             Readymade <br />             Animal Bar <br /> <br />Verdict: BUY!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JKN9|1.0|I saw Santa Trap with Robert Hays on tv, and then the older movie Airspeed with Elisha Cuthbert; then at a theater a worthless movie: Gangs of New York. It had enough interesting material for a 15-30 minute slide show on history Chanel. Why are these people supposed to be interseting? Do I feel empathy and compassion for them? Hardly. Day-Lewis may have been historically accurate vocally and in costume but he seemed to have escaped from Popeye starring Robin williams. Cameron D. was not attractive here. <br />

Clark, Ellen, Rusty, Audrey, and Cousin Eddie are back but this is nothing like the disapointing sequel, European Vacation (that movie was awful), this time the Griswold's decide to stay home and celebrate Christmas the good old fashioned-way. Both of their parents arrive and unexpected guest causes mayhem for The Griswold's, yikes! Cousin Eddie, played geniusly by Randy Quaid. The last hour of the film is non-stop laughs. The perfect holiday movie, I highly recommend the yultide gathering of mishaps and complete fun.
B00005V9IL|5.0|Wow, we didn't know what we were missing...! We had a recording off HBO forever and watched it several times. The tape was just about worn out so I bought this DVD. I guess they had to fit an over-length movie into two hours for TV. There is so much more stuff that we had never seen. An awesome movie got even better. There's also a bunch of very interesting special features. This was definitely a great buy.
B000089RVR|4.0|Life for Rent by Dido is just worth buying for three tracks, the first single, White Flag and the delriously good Stoned and See You when You're 40. The last two songs I mentioned are about 5 minutes each and they are brilliant and her best work to date. The rest of the album is awesome as well, Dido's voice is really soothing and I love her songwriting, very catchy and intelligent. Buy this album today!
0375831002|5.0|The Book Thief is, on the surface, a fairly simple tale of a girl fostered by a washerwoman and her housepainter husband in Germany during the second world war. It is told is some of the most haunting prose I've ever read. The characters and scenes are rendered so beautifully, they linger long after the book is put away.<br /><br />Markus Zusak seems an amazingly young man to write with such lyrical beauty and poignant insight. I can't recommend this book highly enough.

0060987464|4.0|I am a fan of Marilyn Manson's videos. I see them as modern pieces of art just as I see the paintings of the masters of yesteryear as art. Had Manson been bore a hundred years ago he might have become famous as a painter instead of a musician. Though I am a fan of Manson's artistic videos I'm not a fanatical Manson fan which is to say that I don't collect all of his CDS or wear his shirts. I have owned ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR and several bootlegged concerts but that's about it. My reason for buying this book was that I thought there was be an interesting life story behind the dark artist. I expected a story of suffering along the lines of Van Gogh or Kurt Cobain. Turns out that Manson had a normal, if not priveledged childhood. I was a little let down by the fact that there was not an interesting life story outside of the actual events connected to recording and touring as a rock star. Outside of his art, Manson's life was, dare I saw, relatively uneventful and boring. Still I felt the book was good enough to merit four stars.
B00005JL78|5.0|Set about fifty years into the future, the movie is a sci-fi/futuristic mystery that has a fair supply of intrigue and suspense.  Taking place in Washington D.C., in the year 2054 or so, is a new system of law called Pre-Crime.  The system hinders on pre-cogs, who are three gifted people who can see future murders.  Their visions are tapped into by futuristic technology and displayed before law enforcement.  John Anderton (T. Cruise) is the Chief of Pre-Crime, who trusts and enforces this system.  The system is demonstrated very impressively in the beginning of the film.  While Pre-Crime is excelling, so are the questions against it--especially from Danny Whitfer (C. Farrell) who turns out to be Anderton's main rival.  Anderton seeks advice and mentorship from the Pre-Crime creator: Burgess (M. Von Sydow), who is avid about seeing to it that Pre-Crime goes national. <br />Anderton's world comes crashing down however when the system he helped forge comes after him: accusing him of a crime he's supposed to commit.  Anderton's only chance to prove his innocence is to find a minority report: a disagreement amongst the three pre-cogs.   <br /> The creators of Minority Report put together a well thought out idea and plot.  The storyline and dialogue have enormous possibilities, but after the movie ends one cannot help feel as if the film underachieved slightly.  While Minority Report is technically a murder mystery--in a lot of ways--it's not too shocking to discover who's actually behind it.  In truth, Minority Report takes off like a rocket: with a very effective beginning and suspenseful sequences as its center.  Its ending and climax, however, is to be desired and seems to drag to its satisfactory conclusion. <br /> The characters of Minority Report are mostly believable.  The tension between Anderton and Whitfer is most enjoyable, as they battle with their words as well as fists.  Anderton is mostly sympathized in the movie on two counts: the assumption that he is avictim of Pre-Crime and also the disappearance of his son.  The majority of all the other characters in the movie are either meant to halt or aid Anderton's quest for the truth about his future. <br /> Like all other futuristic films, there always seems to be a handful of strange and disgusting minor characters which throws the film into the \\"weird category.\\"  Unfortunately, a heavy dose of weirdness in futuristic films easily makes the film fantasy and loses its realistic edge that it could possess. <br /> The film is rated \\"PG-13\\" for violence, language and a sex scene.  The violence was surprisingly toned down, some people get shot here and there.  The language is tolerable, but there is some drug use.  What makes it rated \\"PG-13\\" is perhaps a brief sex scene, where a man and woman are caught doing it undercovers while little spider robots search their apartment and adjoining apartments for John Anderton. <br /> In summary, Minority Report is a very good futuristic film considering what Hollywood usually dishes out in this market.  Minority Report has suspense, a fair balance of action with drama; and an important message regarding our freedoms, privacy, and safety.  The film is a treat, especially the first time around, despite a complicated plot and an underachieving storyline.
0380733358|5.0|This is one of the best \\"spy vs. spy\\" books/movies I've ever seen -- It helps to see the great movie with Donald Sutherland before reading the book -- You can visualize what's going on in the book -- It takes place during the bombing of London, and you get a feel of what it's like for so many people to have lost spouses, children and family -- But the persistance of Scotland Yard and the British Government Military Intelligence provide an excellent \\"Edge of your Chair\\" ending to this book -- It's definitely a book you can't put down --
0312979479|5.0|This novel is a classic suspense story told by a classic story teller. The book introduces to the reader 10 murderers who are by chance put on an island for \\"vacation\\" by an unknown source. however, as soon as they got on the island things went deadly wrong. One by one, each one of the people got killed, the air was filled with suspense as the methods of the killings were so ridiculously cold-blooded. The killer has got to be one of the ten, could the remainder of the group figure out before they are all brutally murdered?<br /><br />  This book reveals somewhat of what human beings face when they are reminded of what they have done in the past by a horrible incidence. People in this book became almost animal-like in the end, desperate and extremely suspicious; each suspecting the other. A truly magnificant book that will leave the reader hanging until the end!
0571202284|5.0|Without question, if you are interested in creating animation, you will be glad you bought this book. I have several other animation books, but this one has been the most useful to me in moving from refining animation basics to staging longer performances. I work entirely on the computer, but page after page this traditional animator had a lot to teach me! <br /> <br />Over 90% of this book focuses on animating the body. It has a brilliant (but short) section on animating the face, expressions, dialog, and eyes. The focus of the facial animation section tends to be more about the curves and lines involved than the underlying muscles, so I recommend as a nice complement to this also picking up Gary Fagin's excellent \\"Artist's Complete Guide to Facial Expression\\" as well. <br /> <br />Richard Williams is a master of his craft and also a brilliant writer. The Animator's Survival Kit is Highly Recommended!
B000FA57RG|5.0|The more things change, the more they stay the same...<br /><br />Well, given the fact that Madonna doesn't like to tour in Texas anymore (her last Houston concert was for Blonde Ambition), this is, above anything else, a chance to finally see live clips from her Re-Invention Tour, since it hasn't been released on DVD yet.  Madonna- give the fans a real treat; how about a box set of all of the tours from Blonde Ambition on?<br /><br />Anyhow, I'm Going To Tell You a Secret will put some people off, but ultimately will please the fans.  Yes, Madonna discusses her spiritual outlook almost non-stop, but it's mostly digestible.  There are only two things that made me gag.  The first was the overly cliche argument about God's existence with Stuart Price, who happens to be an atheist.  The second was when Madonna waxes about not just waking people up, but giving them a \\"direction.\\"  That bit of hubris should have been left out- how dare she even THINK about giving anyone a \\"direction?\\" Just open the door, and let us find our own way, just like you did!<br /><br />What's funny is that for all that Madonna's changed, she's still very much the same person.  She still likes to be Queen Bee and Den Mother, carp about the hotel rooms, tell people to \\"f\\" off, write hokey poetry, complain about not getting enough attention from her man, etc.  The parallels between the Madonna we see here and the Truth or Dare Madonna are innumerable.  It's just a slightly more mellow, stable version this time around.<br /><br />For my money, this documentary replicates the best aspects of Truth or Dare, without being a cheap imitation.  Above all, Madonna never ceases to amaze you.  She will bare her soul one minute, like when she tearfully thanks her dancers on the night of the last show of the tour.  Then, the next minute, she becomes imperious and aloof, like when an off-camera dancer asks her when she will grace them with her presence for an outing.<br /><br />There are two parts of I'm Going to Tell You a Secret that really made me laugh.  The first is when Lourdes describes how she read from The English Roses at a children's hospital, and then tries to explain the moral of the story, only to be drowned out by her brother.  The second takes place in the pub in London for her Guy's birthday.  She looks so bored, begging to go home, and then resorts to taking a nap on a small wooden bench!  I remember nights out with friends when I felt exactly the same way.<br /><br />Jonas Ackerland is to be commended for the style of the documentary.

The first is when Lourdes describes how she read from The English Roses at a children's hospital, and then tries to explain the moral of the story, only to be drowned out by her brother.  The second takes place in the pub in London for her Guy's birthday.  She looks so bored, begging to go home, and then resorts to taking a nap on a small wooden bench!  I remember nights out with friends when I felt exactly the same way. <br /> <br />Jonas Ackerland is to be commended for the style of the documentary.

B00006ADFL|3.0|Heavenly Creatures is based on a true story about two teen girls who committed murder.  Many other reviwers have given detailed descriptions of the plot so I will forego that here. After some basic research subsequent to watching the film, it seems that Peter Jackson was quite faithful to the original story.  There were certain simplifications needed to fit the story into a two hour movie but that is to be expected.  The story told in this movie is a disturbing one.  The two girls are highly disturbed and engage in increasingly bizaar behavior leading up to the murder.  If you are interested in a character study about highly erratic and disturbed individuals then this movie will surely be of great interest to you. <br /> <br />For pure entertainment value, however, I must say that I found Heavenly Creatures to be lacking in the extreme.  The girls are loud, shrill, and incredibly irritating... at least to my sensibilities.  They are constantly singing (badly), shrieking either in laughter or tears, screaming at their parents, or wildly enthusing about their elaborate imaginary stories that they are continuously writing.  As a finale, these two bash one their mothers' head in with repeated blows from a brick in a fairly grisly scene that actually underplays the violence compared to the real life murder.  Quite simply, watching this movie forces you to endure two of the most annoying and disturbing people you could ever hope NOT to meet for a seemingly endless two hours. <br /> <br />This movie was very difficult to rate because it is such a mixed bag.  For historical accuracy and faithfulness to the real life events, I would give it 5 stars.  Yet, I found it of no entertainment value whatsoever and could not wait for it to end and I would normally give such a film 1 star.  Accordingly, I've split the difference and give it an overall rating of 3 stars.  For those who have never seen Heavenly Creatures, I would strongly urge you to think about whether this movie willappeal to you and not just take all the glowing reviews at face value.
B000E97Y6A|5.0|I have seen in my lifetime several variations of King Kong, from the 1940's through the 1980's. This newer interpretation is one of the best. The main plot evolves and twists, but the subplots are hilarious. I have not laughed so much in a non-comedic movie as I did with this one. The imagination that went into Skull Island is pure psychedelic genius. The creatures, the and fight and escape scenes, the whole inter-relationship between Kong and his environment, and the subtle human frailities uncovered by the greed and avarice of the protagaonists and antagonists: all of these were so well done. I enjoyed this version of King Kong very much and found it very, very entertaining.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just finished this series on dvd and I can't believe it was canceled 4 yrs ago!!  Wish I caught it when it was on television.  I don't like t.v. in general so I wait for the dvds.  What a gem this show is!  I really hope it is revisited with the original cast someday.
0743424425|4.0|I am going to write this review under the assumption that most of us have seen the film.  If you haven't seen the film, you may not want to read on, as there may be some spoilers.  On the other hand, I have seen the film 100 times and still enjoyed this novel heartily.  Both novel and film are radically different from each other.<br /><br />It has been years since I saw \\"The Shining\\" for the first time.  Ever since then, I had kept hearing about how different the book was, how disappointed King was with the change to the story.  I had always, at some point, wanted to read the novel to see how Kubrick changed it.  As an aspiring filmmaker myself, I am always interested to read novels that have been made into films to see how they adapted it into a screenplay.  As mentioned before, King's novel is quite different than Kubrick's film.  Which do I like better?  King's novel by a long shot.  Though I am a huge fan of cinema and love Kubrick's work... a lot was lost through his interpretation/translation of the film.<br /><br />For example, Kubrick depicts Jack as a menacing maniac who is out to slaughter everyone from the get-go, estranged from his mother and son who seem to look out for each other under Jack's terror.  In the novel it is quite the opposite.  Father and Son are the family members that are close, with Wendy the odd one out... actually jealous of Danny's relationship with his father.  Family interactions are lost in the film.  The novel makes much more sense as to what is going on.  There is more of a point to show that the HOUSE itself is haunted, and begins to control Jack... and his hallucinations are in fact hallucinations.  Not \\"real entities\\" as the film may suggest.<br /><br />The sequence of events differs slighty, as well as key moments in the story.  Halloran, the radio, room 217, Jack's downfall, etc.  The dialouge is more intriguing, the urgency to esacpe, the terror itself... much more hair-raising.  Even the ending is completely different.  But I definitely love this book, it rates up there with \\"Misery\\" of the King books I have read.  Buy it used, I got mine (first edition hardcover) right here off marketplace sellers for dirt cheap.<br /><br />And sorry folks... no hedge maze.this book, it rates up there with \\"Misery\\" of the King books I have read.

B00005JOSS|4.0|The Lake House is a romantic drama focusing on a relationship through time. Keanu Reeves is in 2004 and Sandra Bullock is in 2006 and they are able to communicate in writing letters because of a magical mailbox. Simple really. The complications come however when they try to meet.<br /><br />I have read several reviews pointing out the time travel plotholes of this film - only thing is I think those people are misunderstanding the rules of this film. The rules in this film are that the time periods are moving in the same way. For instance, as a made-up example, if it is March 12 2004 and March 12 2006, if it is a day later in 2004 (March 13), then it is also a day later in 2006 (March 13). Understood? Ok good. Now at the beginning of the movie Sandra Bullock doesn't have any memories of Keanu Reeves, yet later on he meets her in her past. Now one might argue- how come she didn't remember this at the beginning? Well sceptics, this film establishes that we are always moving forward and focusing on the here and now. So later when Sandra Bullock suddenly remembers because of both times moving forward in sync we can accept that the change may be sudden. If we were to focus on knowing that Sandra Bullock did know Keanu at the beginning because of his new actions in the past then we'd be going into parallel universe territory- the creators of The Lake House have chosen to avoid that for the purpose of this film- again an acceptable choice.<br /><br />For people who haven't seen The Lake House nothing I've just written may have made sense, and maybe I didn't write it correctly, but all in all The Lake House follows a set of rules that are different to most other time travel films, and once we as the audience accept that we can simply be swept away by the world of The Lake House.<br /><br />The chemistry between Keanu and Sandra is great, especially when they meet when they were never supposed to, and the tension and timing of the movie is as it should be. The Lake House - a romantic time travel story for those who would love to take the time.use - a romantic time travel story for those who would love to take the time.

0714843377|2.0|This is probably one of the best books in terms of style and ease of language used. I read the entire book in less than 2 hours, but I do not think it added any value.<br /><br />The whole book is just re-iteration of common sense and it will not tell you anything you do not already know. It simply brings it all in a few pages written in simple plain English.<br /><br />If you need some inspiration, get this book. If you need to learn something new, then don't because it can not offer you that.
B0002YLC24|4.0|Finally got around to seeing this, as I usually have an aversion to sequels.  Where the original ended in Wien in 1994 this picks up in Paris 2003.  Celine (Julie Delpy) still has the quirkiness, beauty, and naive honesty of nine years before as well as the non-stop articulate rapport and repartee with Jesse (Ethan Hawke).<br /><br />  Because of the depth of conversation there is no sense of soap opera about it.  They still philosophize about life and circumstance.  Jesse is back in Paris promoting a book about meeting Celine (a touch of post-modern self-consciousness), and has a few hours with her as she explains why she never showed up in Wien for the date.  What bothers me about it is not simply that they didn't get each others' numbers in \\"Before Sunrise\\", but if she was that serious and couldn't make it she could have had a messenger or someone in Wien meet him or SOMETHING.<br /><br />  Anyway it starts out predictable, but quickly takes some interesting emotional turns.  Though the ending is technically open, you can easily guess the rest.<br /><br />  I know they made a sequel to \\"A Man and a Woman\\" which I never saw, but no way could it live up to the original as this one does to its original.
B000002IZM|4.0|Blade Runner is the finest sci-fi movie ever made.  Same for the soundtrack. This is it, but they included sound bytes from the movie WITHIN the tracks of music.  I love soundtracks which include sound bytes as seperate tracks, but for some reason when they made this, you get sound clips from the movie buried withing the music at different times.  It's distracting. Still excellent music of course.  And yes this is the disc you're looking for.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I don't think that the theatrical release of this movie is superior to the director's cut but they're both pretty good.  In an age of formulaic movies and action blockbusters that were getting worse and more numerous with every passing year, this was a welcome change.  I heard it described once as John Hughes (Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Weird Science) meets David Lynch (Wild at Heart, Eraserhead, Lost Highway).  I think that sums it up.  It's a lovely film that I can watch over and over.  If you haven't seen it, check it out.

B00005JN0T|2.0|Being a Sci-Fi guy and a fan of some of Asimov's books I figured this film may as well be worth an evening of entartainment.  It barely was.  There were several problems.  I will list them out for you: <br /> <br />- Will Smiths portrayal of the dime-a-dozen \\"good cop with a hunch\\" was bordering on obnoxious. He was loud, annoying, and very difficult to care about.  His backstory was also pretty standard stuff. <br />- Awful CGI and special effects.  Yup, the robots themselves had little or no detail and the action sequences looked about as video game-ish as you can get. Of course there were the usual \\"how did the hero escape that situation\\" scenes. Yuk. <br />- The Police Chief that has to take Smiths badge was also textbook cliche and added nothing. <br />- Very little suspense. Not sure why...but this movie did not have me wondering what was going to happen next. I barely cared anyways. The action scenes were dull and the characters were too.  'Nuff Said. <br />- The movie just didnt know what it wanted to do with itself and got into that \\"funk\\" that some films get into when you feel like they are just burning time up. <br /> <br />Overall, other than the concept which is cool, this film lacked any real excitement and when it was over I had the \\"That's it?\\" feeling.  <br /> <br />Needless to say I wont be adding this to my collection. You can try it out as a rental but even that may not be worth it unless you have absolutely nothing else to watch. <br /> <br />NOT Recommended!
B0000C9JFO|4.0|A fun film to watch.  Follows much of the ol' Coming-of-age story, with the mentoring being done by a slew of flatmates, though in a humorous, light way.  Not sure it's the kind of film I would watch over and over again, but definitely worth a watch.  Solidly entertaining.  Though it's much darker in nature, I think Roger Dodger is a film that people who enjoyed this film would also like.
B000F7CMRM|4.0|From a rhetorical perspective \\"Syriana\\" is probably preaching to the choir.  The idea that oil companies are motivated by profit and will do anything to make more money today than yesterday, and even more tomorrow, has been clear ever since J.R. Ewing ran rampant on \\"Dallas.\\"  The reality that the \\"record\\" gas prices of recent days are relative and less than they were during the oil crisis of the 1970s once you adjust for deflation is lost on a public that would rather keep the math simple and not bring algebra into the equation.  Oil companies make big profits and they make them off of us, but then you can say the same thing about fast food restaurants or pretty much any other American business.  Besides, there is nothing we can do about hurricanes that affect oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, but during an election year you can get politicians desperate to keep their jobs willing to babble empty promises about taking the oil companies to tasks.  It has been sixty years since the end of World War II and Nazis are too old to be functional boogeymen anymore, but the oil companies we will always have with us (well, actually, that is not true, as this film tries to indicate).<br /><br />The plot of \\"Syriana\\" is pretty complex, but the situation is relatively simple.  One the oil producing nations of the Persian Gulf signs a deal to supply its oil to China, which was what the Texas-based oil company Connex wanted to do.  Meanwhile, Killen, a small oil company, signs a deal to drill for oil in Kazakhstan, so Connex strikes a merger deal, which gets the attention of the U.S. government because there are things here that do not add up (unless you think in terms of petrodollars). \\"Syriana\\" was written and directed by Stephen Gaghan, who won an Oscar for Best Screenplay Adaptation for \\"Traffic,\\" which matters because it provides a point of reference which tells viewers that thinks are going to get complicated and convoluted before long, but in the end everything will be revealed in the fullness of time to be parts of a single pattern.  So just watch the proceedings and follow along as best you can.<br /><br />Involved in these machinations are a whole bunch of characters, with veteran CIA field agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney) as the film's focal point (which might sound like it is at odds with winning an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but with everybody vying for screen time it makes sense).  His counterpart in the dynamic of the film ends up being Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon), an oil trader working out of Geneva who becomes a bit more honest in the truth he speaks to power after a personal tragedy.  The cast also includes Christopher Plummer, Chris Cooper, Jeffrey Wright, Akbar Kurtha, William Hurt, and Aleander Siddig, and I refrain from identifying roles and motivations because that is something best left to you in watching the film.<br /><br />The relationship between Robert Baer's \\"See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Solider in the CIA's War on Terrorism\\" and Gaghan's screenplay is that the film is \\"suggested\\" by the non-fiction book.  In other words, nothing is real here, but it is expected to ring true with audiences and it probably well.  However, \\"Syriana\\" got me thinking: the assumption has been that President Bush has is beholden to the oil companies because they have bought him body and soul (not to mention that he tried to be an oil man once upon a time).  But this film suggests that Bush or any other American president should follow their whims and orders because if they do otherwise they may well lose more than their job.in the fullness of time to be parts of a single pattern.

B00004IC9G|5.0|Rolling Stone Magazine reviewed this CD by simply writing one word, \\"Comicbook-rock\\". Battle Hymns is also one of the great metal CDs of all time.<br /><br />Battle Hymns could sound a bit more polished or refined for my tastes (for other fans it works the opposite way), but all the songs on this CD are really good. Vocalist Eric Adams is at his most powerful at least, here on this their first CD, but isn't that the stereotype of the 'great' heavy metal singer? Orson Wells himself narrates the song 'Dark Avenger' - one of the great metal songs of all time. 'Fast Taker', 'Shell Shock', 'Death Tone', 'Battle Hymns' and possibly my favorite, 'Metal Daze' - \\"Own-ly, one, thing, really sets me free, heavy metal, loud as it can be\\", fill up the rest of the CD. Orson Wells would go on to narrate 'Defender' another great great Manowar song found on 'Fighting the World', their most commercial sounding CD.<br /><br />Manowar were probably influenced by Black Sabbath (like evey metal band somewhere along the way) tho they play, generally, a little faster. Manowar hail from NYC tho most people think they are European (where they are considerably more popular). They've written some truly great songs over the years, 'Dark Avenger', 'Defender', 'Mountains'. . . long live true metal.<br /><br />I'm a Manowar fan and I'm not sure I would be if it wasn't for Battle Hymns. I might have picked up one of their other CD's and thought to myself ~'There's one or two songs on here I like but that's it'. Thank goodness for Battle Hymns introducing me to this great band and making me a believer.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the best version made.  It sticks closely to the book and preserves Jane Austin's wit and style.  Miss Austin's larger than life characters come alive in this 5 hour version.  The few additions serve only to clarify.   <br /> <br />Many of my friends and I like to get together a group to watch this wonderful movie once a year or so.  In fact quite a few have been introduced to the wonderful world of Jane Austin for the first time.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is personally one of my all time favorite albums.  It was also the first album I ever got.  And everyone who's giving this album a 1-star rating is just an idiot in my opinion. <br /> <br />From what I've read of those reviews, most of them listen to metal and in my opinion, metal's horrible (like I said, my opinion, so if you don't like it, get over it). I don't think Evanescence is trying to be metal so don't compare them to metal bands, that simple.  <br /> <br />Like most people, I got sucked into this album with the songs \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"My Immortal\\". I found these songs so infectous that I just had to buy the album. <br /> <br />When I listened to the rest of it, I realised how great of an album this is. Amy Lee's voice is superb, and her lyrics are just plain great. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks on the album are \\"Imaginary\\" and \\"Hello\\". If you haven't gotten this album yet (and chances are, with how long this has been out, if you're a fan, you already have) I say you should go get it. Now. You won't regret it.

B000002I2M|5.0|I believe that this is the best Doors album. Period. Now, many of you may disagree with me, but eh, that's your opinion. <br /> <br />I think that Morrison is at his best on this album:  his voice has never sounded better, and his lyrics are the best I've heard from them. <br /> <br />Every song on this album is a great piece of rock and roll history but a few spotlight songs would have to be \\"Been Down So Long\\" \\"L.A. Woman\\" \\"L'America\\" \\"Riders on the Storm\\" and of course \\"Cars Hiss by my Window\\" mostly for the amazing \\"saxaphone\\" solo that's actually made by Jim Morrison's voice. <br /> <br />Jim Morrison is one of the best singer/songwriters ever (right below the craftsmanship of the Lennon/McCartney partnership in my book) and will go down in rock and roll history as possibly the best frontman ever. And this album is a perfect example of all The Doors represent, and I recomend this album to any fan, or newcomer to this band. <br /> <br />Buy it. Now.

6304936362|4.0|A re-make or a modernisation without too must revisionism. The original documentary of the bomber crew on their 25th mission over occupied Europe is chilling in its narrative (reports of passing out withour oxygen at 25,000ft and con trails like nothing you have ever seen outside of a dream, not to mention the exciting intercom banter). This film brings human stories of hope and desparation to the crew, with less foicus on the B-17 as a front line weapon. <br />This movie pulled up a good number of authentic looking B-17F models, without such a variety of gun modifications as in the original, and without the range of scary flak damage evident after landing. their is a good representaion by model planes too, though some of the effects seem lacking in rtotal realism. It all seems to happen to the \\"Belle\\", from guts on the window to wounded crew members, with some broken regulations thrown in. in that way this re-make is only similar in the title, as the propaganda element is diminished and the medal investing ceremony (with the King of England) is ditched. It is enough for the crew to make it back alive. in reality they continued in their recruiting role doing a war bonds tour of the States). what is left out is the fact that later the required number of missions went up to 30 then 35 in the final year of the war. really these guys were blessed. In reality their last flight was a cushy number in France, not a wild flak ride to Bremen. <br />The Base in England seems very authentic, from wake up to briefing and dispersal to the planes, everything matches up. the bombs on trolleys are no longer ridden by harminica playing ground crew, but the Memphis Belle crew sing \\"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me...\\" which seems even more appropriate. as they ride a jeep to the waiting plane. <br />So, for air minded people this film does the business with great interior shots of the B-17 and outside come the Mustang escort (though the later bubble hoodversion id inaccurately shown) and the 109's are the Spanish post war produced versions. I love the movie, try and see it once a week!
B000FA57RG|4.0|While many expected for so long a DVD/Documentary as In Bed With Madonna style, other wanted Madonna to released a live album with her re-invented tracks. Well, here ya' got both. A DVD with a very diverse theme documentary about how tourmates and Madonna herself connected with public and how it felt to be under the preassure of do a great show every single date on the tour. The documentary is very softly done and you'll se a more concentrate working Madonna with a total supportive group which prooved how she has grown up as a person. In the doc, she also talks about family, music and religion. You'll love the poem at the end of the whole tour and the very dramatic ending of the Reinvention. <br /> <br />As music we're talking, though the album tracks are not coplete it has more like a compilation of the most famous songs on the tour and a few faves of Mad... The Beast Within (Justify My Love) is an outstanding song while a more dance vibe on Like A Prayer or more 2005's Holiday made me feel like I'm in heaven. Cover \\"Imagine\\" is outstanding, an A+ track. I'm sad they didn't include other songs instead of some tracks of American Life. Mother's song is really personal to Madonna and she also included her fave Nobody Knows Me and controversial America Life with back ups of helicopters and a more rough sound. Madonna shines on stage and this live CD is a must have. <br /> <br />Also has to hear I Love New York on her original format after being worked for COAD. Must hear!
B00005JP01|1.0|Just when you thought it was over. <br />Just when you thought it was safe to visit your local Walmart's parking lot on a Saturday night. <br />Just when you started to no longer anticipate the sounds of weed whacker-sounding, Asian-made, hot pink/green/blue, sticker-infested eyesores banging through gears while you're just making a trip to your local supermarket to buy a carton of eggs... <br /> <br />THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT HITS THEATRES! <br />* screams * <br /> <br />And this time, it's not enough that they further promote impressionable, naive children, with too much to prove, to go out, spend their allowance money on ricing out mommy's Camry, and kill themselves and others. No, no. This one goes on a deeper level. <br /> <br />They took a classic Mustang... <br /> <br />...still with me? <br /> <br />They took a classic Mustang and put a NISSAN ENGINE IN IT. <br /> <br />If that's not spitting in the face of American culture, I don't know what is. I know this will result in a practically infinite amount of not helpful votes, but you just do not do that to classic American muscle. A Mustang with a NISSAN ENGINE?! That's a travesty. Ricers, stick to messing with the little compact cars with 75 horsepower, not American muscle. You make real car enthusiasts look bad. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, and the movie is terrible as well. <br /> <br />Do not see this summer. Someday, when VH1 does \\"I Love The 00's\\", this will be one of the decade's fads that they will mock. Can you picture Hal Sparks' comments? \\"In Fast and the Furious, the moral of the story is, everything will work out when driving an animated car!\\"
B000002JKS|5.0|Perhaps my favorite Robert Plant solo song that he has done in his 25-year solo career is Little By Little.  It rocks big time, with the lead guitars blasting. And Robert sings in such a bluesy way at the song's closing.  The song has shades of classic Led Zeppelin within it, but keeps a 1985 feel to its sound. It left me speechless the first time I heard it, because it's so good.  The rest of the album stays in that rock vein and this is far better than his effort with the Honeydrippers and their 1984 remake of Sea of Love. His '88 album got more attention, but I prefer this effort more for its organic and live feel.

B000AMJG4Y|3.0|This movie plays like a bunch of cut scenes strung together. MINDLESS.  it rehashes the game and doesn't really come up with anything of it's own.  No real surprises no mind blowing revelations.  But there are some awesome action scenes.  But wait, it's animated.  Stupidly ridiculous action scenes in an animated movie really don't do it for me.  Oh WOW he can jump high.  oh wow his sword is big.  OH wow it's just like the game.  Just like the game, I thought that would be enough but no it's all hype.
B000E5N62U|5.0|Like so much of the Fagen song book, Morph requires at least 10 (careful) listens before its genious is apparent (I'm serious! I felt the same way about the recent Dan titles). I suggest loading it up on your favorite portable music player and going for several long walks or hanging out in your favorite park. The grooves (in my opinion) are supposed to be long! To paraphrase Mr. Fagen, time flies when it's grooving. It's not furniture music. <br /> <br />I think the lyrics are dense and intelligent (\\"Rabelaisean puff of smoke\\" -- brings back terrible memories of Freshman literature...), yet topical and accessible in a very un-Steely Dan way. I find the lyrics brilliant in their simplicity and quite personal. <br /> <br />The harmony and melodies are typical Fagen -- interesting, sophisticated, yet very musical -- and not excessively clever.  <br /> <br />I love this album -- I mean CD -- I'm showing my age, and I'd recommend it to anyone who is a Steely Dan fan, especially to those who liked Two Against Nature and Everything Must go. Actually, I'd recommend it to all inhabitants of planet earth. Enjoy. (My favorite Steely Dan moment is still the break in Home at Last on Aja -- the first record I ever bought) <br /> <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I'm really glad I bought this album.  I liked other Chili Pepper's hits like californication and otherside but never actually bought an album.  Both CDs are suprisingly good and there are lots of songs on BOTH that are great.  Its also a really good buy for the money.  Favorite Songs: <br />Desecration Smile, Tell Me Baby, 21st Century, Storm in a Teacup, Dani, Snow, Charlie, Stadium, Michican, Warlocks, and C'mon Girl
0316286443|4.0|(Please bear with me: I have ADHD and organizing a commentary is tough!) <br /> <br />Kevyn Aucoin heaps praise and brandishes amazement over the ability of some actresses (but never any actors) to endure hours of being photographed or interviewed. He cannot go two sentences without criticizing conservatives or making some outrageous generalization about what Americans think. He actually spends more time talking about how everyone is so hateful and ignorant than he does about make-up. <br /> <br />He comments that he ran out of the movie theater trying to watch \\"Boys Don't Cry.\\" I know he's dead now, but this is a guy who is missing a few screws. He can't even make up his mind about whether he's going to be bothered by other people's opinion of him. Frankly, I'm sure no one thinks much about him at all. <br /> <br />In case you were wondering, he also weighs in on fur, meat, transsexuals, gun control, Clinton, the environment, the 1960s, the (nonexistent) oppression of women, slave labor, child workers, animal testing, recycling, Bette Davis being the greatest actress the world has ever known (!), and on and on and on.  <br /> <br />He seems to have written this book as a response to criticism of his earlier book (which apparently lacked details about how to apply make-up to achieve certain effects). He is a BAD WRITER. For example: He says one should apply \\"foundation (to match),\\" but he never once says to what.
0679457607|5.0|A timeless classic that helped start the \\"inner game\\" revolution - this is the book that points golfers to the other half of the game, the inner aspect of the game. Practical without being hoakey or too metaphysical. One of those book you'll keep on your shelf forever.
B000F6IOBQ|5.0|I say this is an excellent sequel that compliments the first film quite well.  I believe the films are equal in storyline, but the second film seems to have cooler sets and special effects.<br /><br />My one complaint about this film is that it verbally tells you what is happening just a little too much.  Although I enjoy Beckinsale's voice and accent as she tells us about her journey, I was waiting for her to even tell me how many bullets she had left in her gun.<br /><br />However, that minor flaw does not take away that this is a great action film.<br /><br />Some people have commented that this movie fails to deliver what the first movie did, but I don't think that's a fair statement, as we had the element of surprise in the first one.  This film was more of a bad guy chasing after the good guys adventure.  And when one looks at it from that perspective, the movie is really quite good.<br /><br />Give this movie a viewing.  I think you'll be glad you did.<br /><br />It delivers action, drama, romance, suspense, and a little bit of gore.  What more do you want from a film called Underworld?<br /><br />See ya next review.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|While the acting was good and the movie was well done, I would like to have seen more of Johnny Cash in his reformed life instead of so much of his misspent life.  We see that he married June and she took him to church once.  I believe there was a lot more to it than that.  It did show his drug withdrawal, but I would like to have seen more of his spiritual awakening.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I bought a new compaq 2630 for viewing movies...BM was perfect for this project.  Wide screen worked very well.  No drop outs, full sound and excellent color.. <br />Great!! <br />JS in Dallas
B000E33VWW|3.0|This movie should have been titled \\"In Cold Blood...The Condensed Version\\"!!!  I was hoping this movie would be more about Capote's WHOLE life, than just about his book \\"In Cold Blood.\\" Yes, I do have the dvd \\"In Cold Blood.\\"  I enjoyed that much more than \\"Capote\\". One movie about one subject is enough.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This effort is one which grows on the listener over time. The songs are well crafted and suite the vocal styles of both Emilylou and Mark Knopfler. There is an edginess between the two performers like two dancers who are not sure how to react to one another but eventually gain the confidence to feel more at ease with one another. Knopfler's playing , as has been the case on all of his latest outings, is subdued. Gone are the\\"sultan\\" days when his guitar did the talking, now it's the songs that say it all. His vocals are typically never strained but his guitar work also is played on the safe side. Emmylou Harris has found a number of good songs that allow her to use the gracefulness of her voice effectively without over-trying to make her sound like a hip ageing diva. She is at her best when she is singing songs that fit her naturally. <br />This is an excellent record that grows and grows on you the more you listen to it. Given the over produced state of country music these days, this album allows the songs to do all the talking and allows the two featured artitist to sound like they enjoy performing them. <br />You won't be disappointed.
B00006AUIG|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised by Session 9.  It has an air of mystery about it from start to finish, it's well-acted (even David Caruso manages not to overact), and the ending leaves you satisfied but still pondering \\"what just happened there?\\"  It's light on gore and concentrates more on the psychological aspects of the main characters.  If you like things like \\"Blood Simple\\" or other psychological thrillers, this is for you.
1594200823|4.0|THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA answered some questions, like \\"How did corn become such a staple?\\" and \\"Is Whole Foods Organic the best I can do?\\"  Overall, the book went into a little too much detail for me sometimes, and I found myself skipping ahead from hearing again and again about how corn became subsidized to the advantage of Coca-Cola and the meat industry, and to the detriment of the farmer, the cow and eventually the American public.  However, much the information was disturbing as well as staggering.  Many of the books I've read on vegetarian health and ethics mention that cows are force-fed corn, but don't touch on the problems how the foodstuffs like HFCS came to be.  This was fascinating reading and I needed to read it to try to get myself off coke and sweets altogether!  I also appreciated him shedding a light on the organic \\"free range\\" broiler, which seems to be neither. <br /> <br />What should be the main idea of this book is the rightful villainization of the meat/poultry/fish industry who decided, in their great wisdom (and greed), to feed corn to a grass eating animal, in the process having to feed them all kinds of antibiotics to keep them from dying of malnutrition, all the while fattening them faster than they could by grass alone.  In the process they are making America sick and fat, and depleting our oil resources.   <br /> <br />Pollan discusses the topics quite vividly and with intelligence, yet in the end, I became frustrated with him, because even after he had bought himself a cow and looked it in the eye he still did not become vegetarian!  Even after he had worked on a chicken assembly line, he still decided to eat chicken.  Even after he discussed the inefficiency meat production (did he ever talk about the water waste?!) he still eats meat!  To my recollection, he never went into much detail on cholesterol's effects on the body (I suppose you'll have to read John McDougall or Dean Ornish for that), which would have given him another reasonto change.  I guess I took it personally, because he seems to be sensitive and compassionate human being, but he never did quite see things \\"my way\\". <br /> <br />I want to end by agreeing with Erik Marcus who recommended I read Peter Singer's book THE WAY WE EAT first before reading THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA.  MEAT MARKET by Erik Marcus is also a must read.
B00005NB8K|5.0|I think this is a great movie. They did a pretty great job with the sound and everything. One thing i didnt like was that some of the opinions in this nivie were different from life. For instance, when the doors appeared on cbs, they were asked not to sing the line \\" girl we couldnt get much higher\\". As most know, Jim sung it anyway, but it was an accident. Stone made it appear as it was on purpose. Also that one of the other members was made to look like he hated Jim, ehich was not true
0879306033|3.0|This book doesn't read so much like a book as it reads like a collection of essays or old magazine articles (which is what it is, actually). It therefore doesn't have a coherent focus. I would much rather have a book that was written as a book, that follows a thread all the way through - like maybe a chapter pn the development of the oscillator, describing how it works, tracing it's development, pointing out the differences between the various makers, etc. Followed by a similar chapter on filter sytems, whatever. This book in no way does that. But, it is an interesting read anyway. Take note - the Second Edition does cover Japanese synths - Korg and Roland, although, again, in a typically scattershot manner.
0312983867|5.0|I really enjoyed \\"Hard Eight\\".  Like all of the Stephanie Plum novels, this one is a mish-mash of comedy, adventure, mystery, and sexual tension.  Stephanie is famous in her family's blue-collar neighborhood as a bounty hunter.  Mable, the old lady in the adjoining house, has lost her most of her family one by one and lives on Social Security and government surplus food handouts.  So how can Stephanie refuse to help her find her missing granddaughter Evelyn?  Evelyn's inept but kind hearted divorce lawyer, Albert Kloughn, who operates out of a laundomat, decides to become Stephanie's assistant bounty hunter.  Soon Stephanie, Albert, and Lula are looking for Evelyn with help from the sexy and mysterious bounty hunter Ranger.  Stephanie is being menaced by the very creepy Eddie Abruzzi, Evelyn's landlord who is also the money behind the bar owned by Evelyn's abusive ex-husband.  Morelli and Stephanie are on the outs, which gives Ranger a chance to finally put the moves on Stephanie.  Yeah!
0143058525|5.0|Gilbert's audiobook will speak to any woman who wrestles with relationships, spirituality, motherhood and even food. I am not one for heavy mysticism or new age-y mumbo jumbo, so I thoroughly enjoyed her \\"philosophy lite\\" style. Her journey comes alive when hearing it in her own voice. Some travel agency should start an Eat, Pray, Love women's tour!

B00005AXEL|3.0|Twenty years after her debut solo album Bella Donna, Nicks manages to matter.  She was no longer the global force she was in the late seventies, when Fleetwood Mac was at her side.  However, her first album of original material for seven years and her first of new millennium attracted interest from an A-list of younger performers.  This is evidence that Nicks had survived the rock and roll grist mill to emerge as an institution.  She was readily acknowledged as a pioneer who paved the way for many artists, especially women. <br /> <br />To expect another Bella Donna or The Wild Heart from Nicks is unfair, and if someone isn't a Stevie Nicks fan by now there's not much that's going to remedy the situation.  However, to Nicks credit the more recently penned songs on Shangri-La are the strongest ones.  \\"Trouble in Shangri-La\\" is a powerful comment on the pitfalls of fame and/or love, \\"Love Changes\\" surges with hard-won hope, \\"Fall From Grace\\" is balls to wall rock that Nicks hasn't recorded since Rock a Little, and the lush ballad \\"Love Is\\" grows more emotive with every listen. <br /> <br />Though Nicks is in far better form than she was on 1994's forgettable Street Angel, there are still several recurring problems on Trouble in Shangri-La.  Twangy \\"Too Far From Texas\\" is out of place amid the rest of the songs.  \\"That Made Me Stronger\\" is a clunkity song built around some rather overwrought lyrics.  And, again, big production often short-circuits the energy in the songs.  Bottom-line, Nicks performs best in simple surroundings (or at least surroundings that sound simple).  <br /> <br />At this point, Nicks has nothing else to prove.  Trouble in Shangri-La and the 2003 Fleetwood Mac album Say You Will both hit the top five, proving Nicks is still relevant.  Plus, her songwriting on Say You Will was one of the strongest reasons to buy that album.  Where Nicks will go from here is anyone's guess.  Personally, I'd love to see her go back to basics and cut an album of rough gems like the demos she released on Enchanted or even stick to the low maintenance sonic surroundings Lindsey Buckingham created for her on Say You Will tracks such as \\"Thrown Down\\" and \\"Silver Girl.\\"  Whatever she does, Nicks' place in the rock pantheon is guaranteed both as a member of Fleetwood Mac and as a solo artist in her own right. <br />
B00005ASIL|4.0|If you listen to \\"classic rock\\" radio, you get the impression that Jethro Tull stopped recording music right after they released the \\"War Child\\" album (which features the familiar song \\"Bungle in the Jungle.\\")  For years, I assumed that there wasn't much good music produced by Jethro Tull in the \\"post-classic\\" years.      Today, I am probably in that minority of Tull fans that believes Ian Anderson and the boys made better music in the past 30 years (1977 'till now) than they did in their first 7 (1968 to 1974).      And that's where I differ, if only slightly, with the selections included in \\"The Very Best of Jethro Tull.\\"      Let's get to some of the songs that were included that, in my opinion, shouldn't have been: Sweet Dream, Witches Promise, Song for Jeffrey, Broadsword and Roots to Branches.       Delete those 5 songs and replace them with my choices:    North Sea Oil (from Stormwatch), Crossfire (from A), Ears of Tin (from Rock Island), Roll Yer Own (from Catfish Rising) and Stuck in the August Rain (from Roots to Branches).      This adjustment would do a couple things.  It would omit songs from two of my least favorite Jethro Tull albums (\\"The Broadsword and the Beast\\" and \\"Under Wraps\\") and it would include at least one song from every other late period Tull album.      All that said, this isn't a bad Tull compilation by any means.  Given the huge number of songs there are to choose from, I'd say this represents a good representation of their work.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|I saw this movie last year for my birthday, and I was so excited, because the trailer looked so promising. However, what I got was a mess of a movie and very, very, very mixed performances. I tried to justify this movie's shortfalls by focusing on its positives; however, the balance does not tip, it falls apart!! <br /> <br />First of all, the visual effects in this movie are horrible. It has a posted budget of $100 million, and I can't help but wonder where all the money went and how many starving children could have been fed and clothed. Bad special effects, however, cannot compare to the wreck that is Keanu Reeves. He is a tragedy of epic proportions, evoking feeling of sickness and uncontrollable laughter all at once! It is IMPOSSIBLE to take him seriously. I can't think about it anymore. <br /> <br />The positives are very positive, however. The storyline is interesting, intriguing, and attention holding; again, this only goes so far. Also, the supporting cast is superb. Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton are excellent in their roles and almost make you forget about the aforementioned tragedy (Reeves, for those who are lost). However, it is Rachel Weisz that makes this film bearable. She is beautiful, mysterious, and involving. I have read so many reviews that say she was too good for this film, and they were right. <br /> <br />Bottom line: you will beg for your 2 hours back, but Hounsou, Swinton, and Weiss (especially) soften the blow.
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|If you're relatively new to music, you're likely to find this album original and amusing, if you're over 18 and even 20, you'll find it alright but definitely not a grower and probably won't listen to it more than ten times. There are melodies, a stolen rhytms and even a songwriting talent yet somehow the band sounds more like a variety artists, they have this bleak feel to them and are just one of the many recent proofs that any real attitude is essentially dead as far as the mainstream rock and roll goes, all that's left is a bunch of metrosexual dudes without much of a personality or charisma who'll be gone and forgotten soon, forget the media hype, The Strokes, Arctic Monkeys or these guys aren't any rock saviours, rock music needs no saviours, rock music needs no home improvement, rock only needs an audience and these guys don't rock.
B0006M4SO6|4.0|To those not amused by Metheny and Mays' latest work, listen closely.  Upon first listen this album sounds to many like a simple long track of background music, but the intricacy and talent seen given out by these two composers after a second, or twentieth listen is phenominal.  The opening to Part One has a strong and powerful melody, along with a great build to its climax six minutes in.  The intricate metric changes are enough to pique the interest of any good musician, changing to odd time signatures everywhere, as seen in past gems like \\"Letter from Home\\". <br /> <br />Where the beat locks in at a solid 3 or 4, Metheny, Mays, and now Vu on trumpet/flugelhorn deliver several fantastic improv solos over this beautiful 68-minute piece.  A composition this long is nearly imposible to make fresh and original through each new minute, but the group pulls it off in great style.  I can say that this album has given me nearly equal facination through each new listen to \\"Kind of Blue,\\" something I never thought I would admit.  So musicians, go out and buy yourself a copy of the score to this piece, and the album itself, and bask in its glory. <br /> <br />Why the -1 star? I felt that while this long 68-minute composition had great patterns of tension and release, Part Three did not have the climax I had expected.  I have always failed to see why the Metheny Group does not finish out a lot of their songs with the same energy as seen in their core, and instead dwindles to nothing in the last third.  Mays' \\"Are We There Yet\\" (Letter from Home) could have been a prized gem if it held its energy after the opening, and I feel the same happened with \\"The Way Up\\".  I felt the climax happened around 6 minutes into Part One while it should happen only a few minutes from the end of Part Three. <br /> <br />I hope this review helps you make your decision, happy listening!
0783233477|3.0|An otherwise excellent DVD is spoiled by one major flaw.  The  soft-toned characters' dialogue in the last few minutes of the film is completely drowned out by the loud background music. A ruined ending of a really good DVD.  There is one other minor flaw.  When most DVDs are opened the menu appears before the main feature. Not so, here.  To reach the main menu the menu button on the DVD player must be clicked after the feature has started.  This is a minor annoyance.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|My daughter got me into \\"Wicked\\" when she borrowed it from a friend.  She had been dancing to a couple of the songs in her jazz class.  The music is incredibly catchy.  The lyrics are engrossing, and the vocal performances are phenomenal.  We have yet to see the musical, but we both find we can listen to the songs over and over. <br /> <br />The story of wicked follows a girl with magical powers who transforms through a series of tragedies into the \\"Wicked Witch of the West\\".  When listening to the songs, I couldn't help but think of the transformation of Annakin Skywalker, an idealist and well-meaning (and unusually talented) youth, into Darth Vader.  Wicked is a similar story. <br /> <br />The songs go from being fun and catchy to intense and passionate.  The two witches poke wonderful fun at each other in \\"Loathing\\", then become friends.  Elfeba goes from being hopeful and excited in \\"When I see the Wizzard\\" to defiant in \\"Defying Gravity\\".   Both vocal performances are equally passionate ones.  The soundtrack also contains a wonderful love song, \\"As Long as you're mine\\" and a touching song of reconciliation, \\"For Good\\".   <br /> <br />The music is thoroughly enjoyable on many levels.  My daughter is 14 and I'm 41.  We both love listening to it.

B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin deserve their status as a legendary group, one which defined their era (in their case the early to mid 1970s - their heyday and the peak period of classic, heavy arena rock). And on this album, they show tremendous growth and a progression from their debut album. Led Zeppelin II contains a number of their classics - Whole Lotta Love, Heartbreaker, and Living Loving Maid being, arguably, the three best known songs and heavily requested staples of Zep's live shows (as was the John Bonham drum solo showcase, Moby Dick). However, my money is on What Is And What Should Never Be and Bring It On Home; rarely does a band rock as hard as this band does on these two tracks. And rarely does an electric guitar sound like a force of nature yet also as melodic as it does in the hands of Jimmy Page, who also deserves kudos for how well this, and other Led Zeppelin records, were produced.
B000A3DFZE|1.0|I'm glad EC is happy. <br />But sometimes tragedy, youth and passion is able to make music alive and meaningful with feelings. <br />Now he's playing the home scene at 60 years old. <br />This is pleasant pop...but not rock. <br />Maybe at 60 I'll crave easy listening too. <br /> <br />Its a nice package with a 5.1 DVD version in a dual disc with a normal CD mix.   <br />At the moment on Amazon there are  <br />158 used copies available ...some under $3. <br />So what does that tell you? <br />For that price its OK but don't expect the usual Guitar licks or pyrotechnics.
B000CNFC76|5.0|Before Tiger Woods broke the race barrier in golf once again, Harry Vardon and Francis Ouimet broke the class barrier.  Quipped \\"the original underdog story in amateur sports,\\" 'The Greatest Game Ever Played' has to rank with 'Hoosiers,' 'Seabiscuit,' and 'Miracle' among the greatest sports' movies.  And, like the others, it has a concrete story that rises above the field of play.  Here we have our underclass protagonist, Francis Ouimet (Shia La Beouf), who lives close to a country club in Brookline, MA in 1913.  While the golf game is infectious to him, he is mostly excluded from its participation by those of greater money and tradition.  Typical to a movie plot, the mother nurtures his dreams for success, but his father is understandably practical and skeptical.  Then there is also that endearing love interest to a wealthy woman, Shari Wallis (Peyton List) with all the ramifications it has to bridge the class gap.  It all starts with Francis' admiration for golf legend, Harry Varndon (Stephen Dillaine), a British caste system.  Once Francis manages to overcome the obstacles of his status as \\"caddy,\\" he then can face his hero, Vardon, and the British status quo nemesis, Lord Northcliff (Peter Firth) who sponsors his own British player, as well as the American aristocracy in the temperamental John C. McDerott (Micheal Weaver) in the amateur \\"U.S. Open\\".    The movie itself benefits from every detail.  Mainly it is \\"the greatest game\\" unsurprisingly enough that gets the focus; while most of the rest is necessary exposition for us to absorb the setting and our interest in the protagonist.  The technical aspects are stunning with embellished graphics.  Each swing becomes a dramatic moment without becoming tiresome.  The drama of the crowd and the press (\\"...one David against two goliaths...\\") kepps the ball rolling as well.  The weahter and some tense moments make the movie often suspenseful, and Francis' [...]caddy, Eddie, provides some needed entertainment.  The acting is earnest enough, and the editing certainly is persnickety to detail.  Director Bill Paxton brings perfect strokes to the film.  The best aspect of 'The Greatest Game Ever Played' is the emotional impact.  Here it garners a hole in one.    The extras are particularly good for a DVD.  If you don't mind going behind the stage, so to speak, after a magic show, the technical aspects are explained in a fascinating and concise fashion.  There are the usual Hollywood accolades flowing through the commentary:  \\"I couldn't have done it without so and so...,\\" but it is worthy material overall.  There is also an interesting 1963 interwiew with Francis Ouimet, fifty years after the \\"greatest game ever played\\".  In additon, a fine and succinct history is given for the tale of Varndon and Ouimet.  The extras are above par, indeed.
B00006IX0R|5.0|This is the type of band you really want a compilation album from.  If you were really into them and love all their music but can't decide which album to buy, get this one, it's got the best of everything.  It sends you straight back to the moment you became a fan, at the dance, or carpooling in high school, or on that date...whatever!  It's a great album to have.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|'Aeon Flux' released in '05 is a surprisingly good sci-fi, action/adventure film. It has great special effects and it's one of the few films within the costumed female assassin/avenger genre that has a storyline worth your time to figure out.<br /><br />Plot: Set in the future, only one populated city remains on Earth. Outside the high walls surrounding Bregna is only wilderness. Everything appears idyllic on the surface except for one disturbing fact. People suddenly disappear now and then and the governing \\"Congress of Scientists\\" refuse to do anything to resolve the mystery. There is a growing faction of dissidents within the city known as the Monican's who want to know why, Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron)is one of them. When it becomes personal Aeon Flux decides to find out what's behind it all.<br /><br />Charlize Theron does a superior job as Aeon Flux, as does Marton Csoka as her adversary Trever Goodchild, head of the \\"Congress of Scientists.\\" Also featured in a small but pivotal role is Pete Postlethwaite as Keeper.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|I know, there's a lot of reasons to hate the Strokes. Their daddies had the money and connections so they rode the fast track to fame with an obnoxious media blitz touting them as the saviors of rock & roll before they even released an album. And how about the way they dumbed down the sound of uber serious prepunks like the Velvet Underground and Televison to marketable popsongs that those guys would probably hate? And that singer who was trying too hard to sound like Iggy but with a calculated cuteness that would probably make Mr. Popp gag.    Those things might be pluses for aspiring popstars but for real artists who want to make good music it's a lot to overcome. Listening to First Impressions of Earth makes me think the Strokes are trying to break out of their own hype and start the process of becoming a very original band. The first two Strokes albums were right on formula, eleven 3 minute songs designed for radio airplay yet there were still moments when you knew these guys actually had something unique that would come out if they could break out of that prison. And that's what First Impressions is about in it's lyrics, music and overall sound.    First Impressions is as long as the first two albums put together and mixed in with the usual popsongs are adventurous bits like \\"Ask Me Anything\\", \\"Fear of Sleep\\", \\"15 minutes\\", \\"Vision of Division\\" and the incredible \\"Electricityscape\\" that aspiring popstars would never commit to vinyl. Mind you,these adventures don't always but click but I'll take an adventurous failure over a formula success anytime. And even the popsongs like \\"You Only Live Once\\", \\"Heart In a Cage\\" and \\"Juicebox\\" have more muscle, are less cutesy and more intelligent. The Strokes are finally staking out their own sound and I can say for the first time I'm looking forward to what they do next.
B000002KNY|5.0|\\"I Zimbra\\" opens FEAR OF MUSIC kind of famously for its wordless or \\"nonsense\\" lyric, merely vocal utterances, musical syllables coupled with complex rhythmic styling and an irresistible groove.  This is followed by the equally rhythmic yet persecuted \\"Mind,\\" the HEADS at their most minimalist, \\"I need something to change your mind...\\"  We're then freed by \\"Paper\\" and its translucent and resonant homage to guitar rock.  \\"Cities\\" perhaps defines this record and its era (\\"...Some good points!  Some bad points!  Find a city, find myself a city to live in!\\")  It's absurd minimalism at its most ironic.  We're then necessarily treated to the woeful \\"Life During Wartime\\" which also happens to be one of the great party grooves of that era (\\"This ain't no party!  This ain't no disco!  This ain't no foolin' around!\\"  This ain't the Mud Club or CBGB's...I ain't got time for that now!\\")<br /><br />\\"Memories Can't Wait\\" has an unusually lush production for this album, and is reminiscent of acid rock at its most obscure, but is more off-key and desperate, like its lyric suggests.  There is something terribly true, insightful, and disturbing, about David Byrne's lyric \\"Take a walk thru the land of shadows take a walk thru the peaceful meadows...don't look so disappointed, it isn't what you hoped for, is it?\\"  Perhaps the most influential track on the album, Byrne sings, \\"I'm wide awake on memories...these memories can't wait!\\"  That tune is about as profound as the TALKING HEADS get.<br /><br />\\"Air\\" is a delight as light as its name and humorous, and like all these weird little songs, a catchy tune.  \\"Heaven\\" is perhaps the most quoted of all songs on this album (\\"Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens...!\\")  Brilliant but cold, it does remind me of (the great) Neil Young at his most ponderous and protracted.  \\"Animals\\" is what we are, capiche?  Funky, and a little skunky.  \\"They're livin' on nuts and berries...\\"<br /><br />Like objects \\"Paper\\" upon which he writes his lyrics, or \\"Mind\\" from which ideas spring, the artist's \\"Electric Guitar\\" is essential and that track comes across like a 1950s Sci-Fi homage to the institutional claim of one's art, or perhaps the fascist claim of same by the state, or more likely, the cognescenti (i.e. the New York press or Rolling Stone magazine) bringing FEAR OF MUSIC back to personal expression and the hold of such expression on the artist, both fearful and funny. \\"Someone controls electric guitar...Someone controls electric guitar...\\"<br /><br />The last track \\"Drugs\\" is an afterthought nightmare dream float you forget in the night, a footnote, a dream float, an insight and epiphany, the last secret little piece...<br /><br />Produced by Brian Eno, who may have been a bit heavy handed here or there, but only in comparison with the HEADS' followup, FEAR OF MUSIC remains a mesmerizing album that is also underrated.  Perceived by some as an extention of MORE SONGS ABOUT BUILDINGS AND FOOD, but FEAR OF MUSIC is moving towards the HEADS' masterpiece and has a unique transitional quality.  Not exactly loveable, hardly perfect, but nonetheless groundbreaking, fascinating, and essential.  There would be no REMAIN IN LIGHT if there was not FEAR OF MUSIC.which ideas spring, the artist's \\"Electric Guitar\\" is essential and that track comes across like a 1950s Sci-Fi homage to the institutional claim of one's art, or perhaps the fascist claim of same by the state, or more likely, the cognescenti (i.e. the New York press or Rolling Stone magazine) bringing FEAR OF MUSIC back to personal expression and the hold of such expression on the artist, both fearful and funny. \\"Someone controls electric guitar...Someone controls electric guitar...\\"       The last track \\"Drugs\\" is an afterthought nightmare dream float you forget in the night, a footnote, a dream float, an insight and epiphany, the last secret little piece...

B000F6IOC0|2.0|All right, I never was a huge fan of Underworld in the first place, I felt the movie was just really all flash but it had an interesting enough plot and went at a pretty exciting pace.  <br /> <br />This sequel though was boring! I mean that is the one word that came to my mind when the credits finally came on. By the time the ending came, I could have cared less about any of the characters because honestly they all annoyed me. The characters were basically doing what they were doing in the first movie- trying to act all cool and thus coming off seriously wooden, and for some reason this attitude continuing in the sequel just makes the acting seem even worse. The fighting scenes seemed no different than the first movie's ones, definitely nothing that'll make you go 'wow' or anything. This movie seriously starts to drag, or anyway I got this feeling towards the end of the film that I really, really wanted the movie to finish soon. My interest for the movie left even before an hour into the film honestly. <br /> <br />Overall, I recommend the first Underworld over the sequel. The sequel is nothing worth watching. It drags, the acting is pretty weak, and the plot itself, though sounds interesting, turns to out to be nothing amazing. I don't plan on watching it again. <br /> <br />2/5 stars only.
B00000DRA9|5.0|Very good I wish more music was like this real 80's style <br />Brings back memories of school. <br /> <br />My kids will love it too. <br /> <br />Every song from the film on the cd
B00000K19E|5.0|`The Matrix' released in '99 is in my opinion one of the most original, entertaining and thought-provoking films in the last 20 years and an undisputed classic in the sci-fi, martial arts, action/adventure genres.<br /><br />I probably should also add the genre of religious films to the list. Initially you'll most likely be overwhelmed by the technological aspects of the film and focus on the computer lingo. However eventually you'll see that it also has a strong spiritual side and realize that is steeped in Eastern mystical philosophy. 'The Matrix' embraces the concept that the world as we experience it is only illusion (Maya) and to be truly free one must strive to break through the bonds that hold us (the Matrix) to the transitory nature of our experience and see things as they really are. What a concept!<br /><br />As is the case with most financially success films, `The Matrix' would spawn two sequels. Though the next two installments of the \\"Neo Mythos\\" would surpass the original in special effects, neither would come anywhere close to matching the sheer originality, inventiveness, spiritual context and audience interest of the first.<br /><br />The digital shaman has arrived and the revolution is about to begin. The world as we know it is an illusion, take the red pill and WAKE-UP!<br /><br />A must add to your personal DVD library. One of the Essentials.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Three Days Grace comes out with another great CD.  They're songs are better, most of them are heavier than their first album, but they have that same sound where if you hear a song on the radio, you know its them, but yet no two songs sound the same.  If you liked the first album, you will definetly love this one.  I got it on release night and havent stopped listening to it since.  An all around great album, even the lyrics are a tad bit better.
B000A2H812|5.0|Wow!  This album is my favorite.  It has many songs for many moods and is a good introduction to Gogol Bordello.  They are an extremely talented band. <br />If you get this, you will not be sorry.  Enjoy!
B00003CX9E|5.0|A magnificent film!  If you didn't like this film it is probably because you are depressed from missing two hours of MTV or video game playing!
1881273156|5.0|This book changed my outlook so much.  It demonstrates how different relationships can be when one makes an effort to find out what others' love languages are.  It almost seems oversimplified, and yet it works.  I think a lot of people's lives would turn out differently if they had used this simple, but wise approach in their dealing with their spouses, children and friends.  I recommend it to all!!!!!!
B000AARKOO|3.0|This movie was %100 ok. It wasn't very great (though it had a very good chance to be), nor was it very bad. The imagery of nearly everything (Jerusalem, the battles, the massive amounts of crusaders, the blood the gore) I enjoyed quite a bit. The story line I could care less for, it took too long to come to its medicore end. The interjection of modernist liberalism wasn't very \\"historical\\". Do you really think a knight from the Middle Ages would make a speech like Orlando Bloom's at the end? If there is one gleaming problem with this movie, more so than the historical inaccuracies, it is the modernist thinking. If you really think this movie is a balanced portrayal think again. Every Muslim was depicted as tolerant and fair and every \\"real\\" Christian Crusader was depicted as blood thirsty and greedy. Not one clergyman was depicted as anything holy or righteous. I don't doubt the lines \\"convert now and repent later\\"...what I do doubt is that every one of them was deceitful. Where was the Catholic part of the Crusades? Did any of the Crusaders pray? There was plenty scenes of Muslims praying, in fact a long scene with them praying. Even the hero, seemed to be denying his faith through the majority of the movie. This isn't history nor is it good fantasy, there is no substance beyond the fighting. I enjoyed the fighting for what it was. Other than that, I didn't enjoy this movie at all.
B000F6IOC0|1.0|Everything in the movie was too dark and I almost fell asleep. You would think for a hybrid Michael would be bigger than he was. Victor's wings were interesting- now you see them, no you don't. Other than that, nothing too spectacular. Just vampires and werewolves. Would've been interesting if Buffy the Vampire Slayer was in it.
B00004RFFI|4.0|One of the better movies of this type. Very exciting and very entertaining.
B000002KY8|5.0|'1999' is funky, fresh, and very catchy....He's got some pop-friendly cuts like '1999' and 'Little Red Corvette' that are impossible not to love...Then he's got some crazy 'out there' but infectious songs like 'automatic' 'all the critics love you in NY' and 'lady cab driver'....And of course the clever balad \\"international lover\\".... <br /> <br />Although I was too young (I might not even have been born yet) to remember those days, I think the general consensus is that this was the album that propelled Prince to super-star status and solidified his position as one of the most creative and unique musicians of his time, or any time period for that matter....
B000FBGBPC|4.0|First of all I'm mad that it took so long for these guys to come out with their second CD, but I know that you can't rush art if you want it to be good. So what does that say about the artists that rush their second album? Well let's just say Ashlee Simpson came out with two albums in the time it took 3DG to come out with their second one. You give them a listen and you'll know. <br />But this isn't about Ashlee Simpson. This is about our Canadian boys: THREE DAYS GRACE! <br /> <br />First of all, I would like to say that it was love at first listen for me with their debut album, so you can guess that I had high expectations for their next album. I can tell you that I wasn't disappointed! Far from it! <br /> <br />One-X has it's ups and downs like most albums. Nothing is perfect, but my likes and dislikes of the album might not be the same as the next person reviewing the album. <br /> <br />What I liked: 3DG has a distinct sound that you would recognize if you heard it anywhere. I was pleased to hear the dark, thrashy style maintained in One-X, as was the style of their first album... but at the same time it wasn't a carbon copy of their older stuff. Nothing aggravates me more than listening to a follow up album that sounds exactly like it's predecessor. The songs in One-X are still filled with catchy tunes, meaningful and artistic lyrics, BEAUTIFULLY put together melodies and, of course, still chock full of head-bangingly goodness! <br /> <br />What I didn't like: A lot of the songs were about love. I roll my eyes to that. Sure they're not the kind of sappy love songs that a typical pop/ballad packaged and purchased star would sing. Sure, love is important and a beautiful thing... but there are more things to life AND there are different kinds of pain out there. I'm just not feeling the overplayed subject to 90% of the songs out there. <br /> <br />Song review and rank out of 5: <br /> <br />1) \\"It's All Over\\" - Possibly my favorite. Angry, bitter, moody song thatmakes you feel good all over. And you gotta love the guitar solo. It's beautiful! Great way to kick off the whole album! 5/5! <br />2) \\"Pain\\" - Another great song because of the thrashy guitar and raw vocals and lyrics. However... love... ung... but still a 5/5! <br />3) \\"Animal I Have Become\\" - Love this song at least until they ram it down my throat on TV and the radio, as it is their first single from One-X. I don't feel as if this one is as put together as the others. 4/5 <br />4) \\"Never Too Late\\" - Sad and powerful song, but not sappy or roll-eye-worthy. I love the lyrics and melody, so: 5/5 <br />5) \\"On My Own\\" - Great song but not really memorable. 4/5 <br />6) \\"Riot\\" - You want to talk THRASHY? This is as thrashy as they come! I LOVE this song and its rebellious feel. 5/5 <br />7) \\"Get Out Alive\\" - Adam's voice in this song is to die for. It shows a lot of range for me then just his screaming and raspy capabilities (which are also great!). His voice is smoother and on key and he holds his notes longer. This boy has talent! It's also a really beautiful song with clever lyrics. 5/5 <br />8) \\"Let It Die\\" - I always skip this song unless I'm too lazy to. I just don't feel the lame love crap and it sounds too radio friendly to me. 1/5 <br />9) \\"Over and Over\\" - I feel the same way about this song as I do for \\"Get Out Alive\\" and \\"Never Too Late\\". I just love the melody, especially for the chorus. It's a love song, yet I adore this one. 5/5 <br />10) \\"Time of Dying\\" - I'm not too crazy about this song. It's alright, but not one of my favorites. Not catchy enough and a little too consistent with the lyrics. Another song with a radio friendly feel to it. 3/5 <br />11) \\"Gone Forever\\" - Another SKIP song for me. It's annoying like \\"Let It Die\\". 1/5 <br />12) \\"One-X\\" - I really wanted this song to end the album with a bang but instead I got a mediocre pop and a fizzle. It's alright, but one of those forgettable songs that you skip and go back to replay the first song on the album. It's a \\"meh\\". 2.5/5 <br /> <br />So out of 12 I LOVED 7, liked 3 and disliked 2. That's great for any album! To compare it to their first album I'd say they're equal with each other since there were songs I loved from the first one and songs that I skipped and forgot about. So I suggest that you go and buy it and listen to it when you're angry or depressed or angsty or whatever it is you're feeling because One-X will help you through it. <br />Don't burn it. <br />BUY IT. <br />You won't regret it! <br /> <br />~Lisa*
B0001I55SS|4.0|The first time I watched The Black Hole, I was 5 or 6. Now I'm 32 and it was a movie that made such a lasting impression on me that I decided to watch it again.   I agree with some reviewers here on Amazon: It has its problems. Let's get some stuff out of the way: some claim the ending is simplistic: \\"the good ones go to heaven and the bad ones to hell.\\" Not quite. 2 crew members actually die and disappear and they are not exactly \\"bad\\". The crew of humanoids also goes to hell. Why? There's no explanation for that. (Maybe it's because they're more robots than humans. Nobody spotted that?) The special effects: a bit stiff for 1979, yes. \\"Strings holding the robots?\\" Didn't see any. I was more concerned with the atmosphere and the story, and they are both enthralling. \\"The ship breaks and the humans are not sucked into space.\\" Yes. But Cygnus created an environment where there is some sort of gravity, remember? Well, if someone wants to attack a sci-fi movie, they might even claim that Stephen Hawking didn't wrote it, so it's totally wrong. It's fantasy, folks! \\"The dialogue is clunky.\\" Yes, it is, but the target audience was supposed to be children so I don't see any problem there, although the line \\"what cause the cause\\" was very unfortunate... the \\"heroic\\" music does seem overdubbed and makes one cringe, when Holland saves Kate... but the rest is effective, and in fact, the title theme, by John Barry, recreates the spiral of the black hole in a poetic and powerful way.    The Black Hole was a flop at box office. I have a theory for that. There's something rarely mentioned - this is a hybrid film, the target audience are kids (and I know I was overwhelmed at 5) but it has a gloomy side to it. The basic premise is actually quite dark for children, and more adult oriented. The black hole is death, of course, it's the unknown. The mad scientist is trying to be God and turned his former crew into humanoids, living dead! In the end, he gets trapped inside a machine forever! This is almost like a myth or a sinister fable. The good guys go to heaven, yes, and the bad ones to hell. It's a legitimate way to see things, I think. But don't forget the film ends at this point. It's not Herbie by any means!  On the art direction department, the film aged well. The Cygnus is probably the most beautiful ship in sci-fi movies. The black hole is menacing although the effect in itself seems simple. In the days before CGI and computers, filmmakers had to press it on the ideas department. This movie has plenty of interesting thoughts. If The Black Hole were made today we'd probably get state of the art effects and cardboard actors, and some big name director making a fool of himself, like Fincher on Alien 3.     The movie doesn't work at full tilt because it mixes adult elements with light ones: the 2 funny robots with the gloomy atmosphere, the vision of hell and the sombre hallways and light dialogue. The shredding of Alex Durant (Anthony Perkins) was quite scary for me as a child, and it doesn't quite gel with the cheery aspects of the film, like the funny robots talk. It's unbalanced. It's almost as if they thought they had a great sci-fi movie in their hands, but the contract said: \\"kid's stuff\\". If some of the light elements were taken away, and the dialogue was worked over, this could be a dark masterpiece. Nevertheless, it remains an interesting film, it's truly the dark side of Disney. It doesn't seem a Disney movie at all, and it's much darker in tone than Star Wars for sure.  If you watched this as a kid, like me, and loved it, maybe now you'll know why!
B000BYRCH4|4.0|I grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local Target....  craving the Summer sun and needing an island vacation....   <br /> <br />The cover appealled to me for these reasons and I admit I was not at all disappointed in the movie.  The scenery was indeed spectacular.  The underwater diving/snorkling scenes were clear, crisp, and just what the doctor ordered.  Even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful. <br /> <br />OK, enough of the shallow stuff....  the movie was indeed much like the 70's flick \\"The Deep\\" which I enjoyed back then as well.  The characters of Jared and Sam were pretty believable - poor, honest, and happy folks (most of us would love to really be this happy - let's face it!) The introduction of Bryce (played by Scott Caan) really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers, twists, etc.   <br /> <br />Overall, the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives.  Would I want to deal with Tiger Sharks?  No, but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring 9-5 job every day.    <br /> <br />
B000E97HIA|5.0|First off, I'm a relatively new Prince fan (about 3 years now)...I knew his singles from when I was a kid, but never truly appreciated just how talented the man was.... <br /> <br />While this album didn't mezmerize me like say '1999', Sign O' Times, Purple Rain, or Dirty Mind did, it still stands strong on its own...And its still head and shoulders above 99.9% of all other pop or RnB music out today.... <br /> <br />Personally, this album is worth buying for \\"Beautiful,Loved,and Blessed\\" alone--Just an all-around perfect soulful ballad...\\"The Word\\" is another inspiring and soulful track to check out as well....And as usual Prince gets funky on tracks like \\"3121\\" and \\"Lolita\\".... <br />Compared to all the other Prince albums I've heard, I would rate this prolly a 4.25...But honestly, this album is worthy of a 5 stars....
0345350499|5.0|Marion Zimmer Bradley created a masterpiece in this book.  She manages to breathe new life into the Arthurian characters.  The men and, especially, the women in this book are vivid, alive, and some of the most believable characters I've ever had the pleasure to read.  The magic is beautiful without being too over the top.  This is one of the few books that I was sad to finish...I didn't want the story to end.
B0001W8Q9Y|4.0|This is a revision to the review I submitted on June 23rd. At that time I had listened to 'Marbles' three times and felt that was ample spins to rate and review the album...Well I spoke too soon. This release has more to it than I originally gave credit. What changed my mind you ask?...simple answer...watching the DVD 'Marbles on the Road'(extended 2 DVD set). Something about visually seeing the music of Marbles made me see/hear some beautiful music that I failed to get from the Audio CD...now I hear something I like in most of the tunes(even the 4 marble theme songs). Fantastic Place is, without a doubt, my favorite song...the chorus going into \\"Take me to the Island\\" part is the stuff (the \\"hooks\\" I spoke of in first review) that makes the hairs stand up...very moving! So I am bumping the 3 star rating to at least 4 stars and may eventually revise it to a higher rating after further listens/viewings. For anyone who hasn't seen the accompyning DVD of Marbles, I would STRONGLY recommend it...just make sure you get the extended version (available only from Marillion's website) as it includes the rest of the show...most notably 'Afraid of Sunlight','King' and 'The Great Escape'.
B00008ADPF|5.0|Nickelback follows up Silver Side Up with another catchy, angst-driven grunge disc. What's good is that the lyrical content is more varied with this effort. The one downer: \\"Someday\\" sounds virtually identical to \\"How you Remind Me\\" (tempo, guitars, drum parts, everything ... there's even a mash-up avaiable online where the two songs are played simultaneously and you really notice the similarities). <br /> <br />Other than that, there are songs dealing with social matters \\"Believe it or not\\", \\"Throw Yourself Away\\", Chad Kroeger's personal relationship demons \\"Do This Anymore\\", \\"Someday\\", to mention a few, and songs that are just plain fun to rock out to \\"Because of You\\", \\"Flat on the Floor\\". <br /> <br />This album is pure grunge with a commercial twist that gives it an almost universal appeal. No, it will not appeal to music purists, nor will it appeal to fans of softer music, but it will to a lot of other people. <br /> <br />That, and the fact that it is a little more varied lyrically than Silver Side Up, and you have a winner.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|The Constant Gardener is by far the best political thriller in recent memory. Fernando Meirelles creates a web of paranoia, political intrigue and an interesting and haunting love story all rolled into one beautiful looking film that captures the spirit and the landscape of the African nation. Rachel Weisz not only cements herself as one of the most powerful, versatile and talented actors of her generation with her performance but also raises the stakes highly in this taunt, scary and ultimately tragic love story. Weisz not only makes you believe in her character but also makes you aware of the power of the human spirit. Her co-star Ralph Fiennes is just as good with a role that is a mixture of vulnerability and courage and his performance is the best of his career. Weisz and Fiennes carry this picture into the heart of darkness, corruption and lies and they both bring the viewer along for the ride and Meirelles gives this ride a touch of realism that is refreshing and disturbing all at the same time. <br /> <br />Finally, a bold statement with some heart and soul from Hollywood, a rare thing in this time and age <br />
B00006EXL5|5.0|this is an amazing cd from mcr.  their recent stuff such as \\"three cheers for sweet revenge\\" and especcialy the \\"life on the murder scene\\" cd(the dvd was nice but still could've been better)are awful! get this in your heads.... EMO ISN'T REAL!! it's a musical term.  it is impossible to be emo... ive never seen a real one atleast... all i see are wrist slitting freaks who brag about how sharp their razors really are... GROW UP! gothic is amazing and as real as your lives that were created by an all knowing, and all powerful God so they shouldnt be wasted.  and all of you \\"EMO POSERS\\" should just quit.   <br />i totally recomend this cd to those that care about good music rather than fashion statements and so called \\"emo trends\\"
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Well, I'm probably not your typical AFI fan...I'm a 38-year old single mom...but I was recently introduced to AFI while I was putting my make-up on before work one morning a month or so ago. I had MTV on as my background sound...and suddenly heard 'Miss Murder'.  I was drawn to the TV and sucked into the sound and the sexy Davey Havok.  I immediately went out and purchased 'decemberunderground'.  I wish 'Prelude 12/21' was longer, I LOVE 'Miss Murder', and 'Summer Shudder'.  The other songs will grow on me for sure.   <br />When I was younger I was what we called a 'Wavo' - Someone who was into New Wave music (we're talking the mid-80's here).  I was totally into Depeche Mode, Violent Femmes, Dead Kennedys, some Butthole Surfers, etc.  So hearing AFI was sort of like a blast from the past for me.  (Since I've been a mom, Top-40 is what I mostly hear). <br />I was a little concerned over my new-found fav band when they appeared on the MTV 2006 Movie Awards.  Afraid they'd be a sell-out band soon.  But I think they're sound is still too 'alternative' for Pop Music.   <br />I can't wait to get Sing the Sorrow and a few other older albums.  I think AFI will part of my repetoire for a long time to come.
B00006DEFA|5.0|I love Mozart and bought the VHS version of 'Amadeus' shortly after it became available. The DVD version is far superior, although not because of the additional scenes in the Director's Cut. The visuals effect is clearer than the VHS version and seems fresh and vibrant. Maybe my VHS version faded over time. <br /> <br />This is absolutely the best movie about any musician or composer ever done. The music is without doubt the best assemblage of Mozart's best.  <br /> <br />Although the Gran Partita could have been played a bit longer and without the abrupt conclusion that Marriner introduced. The Adagio is my favorite piece of music and must have been given to Mozart to write by God. A point made several times in the movie by Salieri. The dramatic effect in the movie is amplified by the playing of the music by the small wind ensemble, the crowd assembled to hear it, and Mozart's (Tom Hulce's) late appearance to take over as the conductor. This scene brings tears to my eyes every time I watch.  <br /> <br />After I recently bought the DVD version, I researched the Gran Partita on the internet and was amazed at the wealth of material and feeling for the piece. This is paralleled in the movie by Salieri when he describes how he reacts to the printed music. His words are remarkably how most commentators view this music. In fact the more I read the more I realized how much this single piece of art is revered throughout the music world. Which led me to believe that Peter Shaffer (the writer) must have done quite a bit of research before writing the screenplay for the movie. <br /> <br />This is a must buy for any DVD collection!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam never went away - I could never figure out why \\"Riot Act\\" didn't get huge publicity:  It was brilliant!!  I think Pearl Jam has just decided to give in to a bit more of the interviewing and stumping for this CD to finally get their message across, which is simply, \\"Hey, we're over here and we have A LOT to say!\\"  Glad to see people are finally listening again.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|for me their are some cds that surpass awesomeness i'd say they are ultra-mega awesome those are \\"NWA-Straight Outta Compton\\"\\"Nirvana-Nevermind\\"\\"Rage Against the Machine\\"\\"KoRn-Issues\\"\\"Mudvayne-Ld 50\\"\\"Cypress Hill-Black Sunday\\" and of course \\"System of a down-Mesmerize\\" like all the cds above mesmerize has great songs about real-life problems the songs are even more memorable than all the cds i mentioned above seriously songs like byob,cigaro,statue,violent pornography, hell every song on this cd was stuck in my head the first month i had this cd its the only cd i listened to 5 times in a couple of weeks and i have a lot of cds if you hear someone talking trash about this or any othe soad album just ignore it and buy this great cd
9707704667|5.0|I just want to make a correction to jC \\"iRebel\\" (Andover MASS). This book is a novel written by Mario Vargas Llosa. The author of \\"Liberty for Latin America\\" is Mario's son, Alvaro Vargas Llosa, who is a journalist. This novel does not have anything to do with politics or economics, it is a love story. <br />By the way, I read the book in spanish and it was just great, however it is not one the greatest of Mario.

He couldn't put the book down. He kept reporting all the violent events to me. He told me the book was predictable, but he'd recommend it anyway. I'm just happy that he's reading!!!
1586211676|5.0|A Great Financial Philosophy Book! <br /> <br />If you are stuck in what Robert Kiyosaki calls the rat race, or a regular 9-5 and dream of financial freedom, you may need a change in your financial philosophy, or the way you look at how money and more particularly net worth is created. That's right, created.  <br /> <br />I read all of these books around 2000, and it played an important roll in my  transformation from a Wall St. stock broker to the co-owner of a real estate holding company with over $25,000,000 in real estate. (In 5 years)  <br /> <br />In my opinion the most important concept to understand is how assets create wealth. Especially large, leveraged assets. The second concept and if this is not fully understood the first concept can be disastrous, is to fully understand cash flow.  <br /> <br />That's basically it; you get these two, and I mean really get them then there is no stopping you. I've read about hundreds of other real estate and business giants and the main thing that brings down the majority of them is they understand the 1st concept but forget the importance of the second. Guys like Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, Ron Perelman, Larry Tisch, Harry Helmsley and tons more who I cover on my Blog (The Real Estate Investors Blog on Bloglines) are not at all afraid of leverage, but they are scared to death of overestimating cash flow.  <br /> <br />The book may seem so basic, but the concepts weigh so heavy in determining ones financial future.  <br /> <br />By Kevin Kingston, author of: A 20,000% Gain in Real Estate <br />

B000FQJAIW|4.0|I'll rate this four stars for the Movie -- but the title.. <br /> <br />Well I have a Laser Disc release of a New hope here in my hands that clearly states, on a label, on the cover - \\"LAST CHANCE to own the original version of Star Wars\\" <br /> <br />Guess it wasn't... <br />Hmm, I think I should get the new one free...
B000683VI4|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS ONE OF THE BEST ROMANTIC PERFORMANCES I HAVE EVER SEEN.  THE DIRECTOR, ACTORS AND OTHER FILM SPECIALIST NEED TO BE PRAISED.  I ONLY HOPE THEY DO MUCH MORE PERFORMANCES LIKE THIS ONE AND SOON.
0385338694|5.0|I loved all of Sophie Kinsella's other books and I couldn't wait to tear into this one!  I was not disappointed.  This book was witty, fun and utterly addictive....it begs to be read in one sitting....so I did! <br /> <br />Samantha Sweeting is a great character, with flaws that all humans possess, who does something that most of us probably wish we could at one point or another.  The story was fast-paced, completely hilarious and in some points, sadly accurate.  Kinsella's writing style is sparkling - her use of the character's inner monologue in little snippets makes me laugh out loud.  I could pictures all of the scenes in this book translating into a fun movie! <br /> <br />If you are looking for something light and fun that will keep you laughing, pick up this book or anything else by Sophie Kinsella.  I'm just waiting for her next masterpiece!
B000059HB7|5.0|i really don't know how to begin this review except to say that this is one of john wayne's,dean martin's and howard hawks best films. everything just comes together and there isn't one false note in it's 141 min. running time!it never loses it's stride and my only problem with it is that i wanted it to go on longer.wayne is a sheriff tring to hold a rich mans brother for murder as the brother hires killers to break him out and kill wayne! dean is the one time righthand man of wayne's who is now a hopeless drunk but when the chips are down steps up to help. walter brennan is his other helper and he's tough and funny but also gimpy, now add a young rick nelson(who is really very good here) as a babyfaced gunfighter who also helps and you have one great western. now add angie dickinson as waynes love intrest and you have a classic! the film really belongs to dean though,and his drunken gunfighter tring for a second chance is dead on and dean was never better than this,he really colud act and this is a shineing moment in his acting! the whole thing is action packed and just more fun than it has a right to be!!! the cast looks to be having a great time and it carrys over the screen to those watching. you can't go wrong going to \\"rio bravo\\"!!!! check it out!!!
B0001XAS1M|5.0|This is a rock album produced on a gran scale. The album sounds more like a musical or a motion picture sound track. You will most likely either love or hate it. Some of the songs are great and all are good.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|My 16 year old daughter is the one who wanted this soundtrack.  I am so blessed that my daughter would rather spend her money on this gorgeous soundtrack than the garbage that's out there in the music world today.
