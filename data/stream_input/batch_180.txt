0783225792|4.0|bobby de niro is known for appering in ganster and mobster movies and making them great. This movie is no exception he leads an all star cast including Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone, and Don Rickels just to name a few. De Niro plays a gambler who can't get enough. He moves to Las Vegas and is put in charge of an up and coming casino and takes it to the top. He is in awe of a beautiful girl who has a nack for being were the money is they utimitley get married. Joe Pesci and his crew come out but there behavior quickly gets them band from every casino in the city. He and his crew are losing thier touch and are not the most feared anymore. De niro's marrige falls apart his wife becomes a junkie and almost kills thier kid on more than one occation. The FBI is all over everybody for various reasons it gets so bad  that De Niro and Pesci almost have to break off all communication. Somebody in way back in the  town where they came from gives them all away. Pesci and his brother are beaten and killed. Stone went back to her old boyfriend and got five million from her saving and blew it all in a few months on drugs and she dies. De Niro is almost killed by a carbomb but gets out alive and well. He goes back to his home town and picks winners like he alawys did for gambling. This movie potrays casino life and what happens to you when you cheat, you will be punished. This a graphic movie and has a ton of vilonce but it is a great movie and is one of De Niro's and Pesci's best defintly not as good of GOODFEELAS though. Even though their is not any good extras I recommened you get it because it is a classic in it's own way.
0790733897|5.0|The movie Bullitt has the absolute best car chase ever filmed. I just purchased a 2001 Ford \\"Bullitt\\" Mustang, a limited edition car, only 6500 were made. Any Bullitt fan should have one!
B00004WGC4|5.0|If I had to choose one set of movies to watch for the rest of my life, this would be it!  I have honestly watched every episode at least 25 times, probably more.  John Cleese has never been more hilarious.  He plays this hysterical character who spends much of his time saying things to his guests/customers that we all wish we could say at our jobs.  Of course, since I work in the Hotel industry, I can really appreciate all the humor but I really think anyone who works in any kinds of customer service would highly appreciate these videos.  My favorite show is the &quot;Communications problems&quot; episode with the wicked obnoxios &quot;classic guest from Hell&quot;  I only wish they would have made more than 12 episodes!  *This set is worth the money*
B00005NI5Y|5.0|In the era of bubblegum pop crammed down our throats by the diluge of boy bands, teen-pop princesses, and tasteless record executives, Dylan's newest, &quot;Love and Theft&quot; is the stuff dreams are made of... perfect songwriting, lyrical prowess, and one of the tightest bands ever assembled. Dylan's latest masterpiece is the long-awaited follow up to the 1997 multi-Grammy award winning &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; and is more than worth the wait. If you love top-notch songwriting and the incredible group dynamic possessed by Dylan's latest band (his road band for the last several years), you need to do yourself a favor and pick up this album!<BR>Sadly, this album was released on the same date as the horrible terrorist attacks in NYC and Washington. However, leave it to Bob Dylan and his impeccable songwriting talents to add some joy and pleasure into a dark and dismal day in American history. A true masterpiece.
B000009QPE|1.0|This is one of talent-less bands, nothing but a wall of noise.<BR>How do they know one song from another I just cannot fathom.<BR>Megadeth and early Metallica are thrash with mucisianship.<BR>Slayer and Kreator are all else.
0385040253|5.0|This is THE authoritative work on knots.  There is simply no better book available.  Every kind of knot for every purpose is detailed along with every variation (good or bad) that you are likely to find.  Includes a lot of details and stories about many of the knots and additional information on why tieing it one way might be preferrable to another.  Decorative knots, occupational knots, it doesn't matter, it's here in this book.  How to tie them, when to use them, when to use another knot.  This book is from an expert for those who want to be an expert on the quickly disappearing art of knot tying.
0688091717|5.0|My five year old daughter and I have our favorite time of the day every evening when I am taking her to bed. Then we read, read, read and read. Both picture books and chapter books.<BR>It is important to keep on reading picture books to the kids also when they outgrow the age of a toddler. There are so many great pictures and art in picture books that can help the children widening their horizont.<BR>With four kids in the house we have a huge collection of children's books, and among them some absolute favorites. And Elmer belongs to this group.<BR>Elmer the elephant is different from the other elephants in the jungle. While the others are ordinary grey he has patchwork colors, yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, blue, green, black, white - what a wonderful way to repeat colors over and over for a little human being.<BR>But Elmer doesn't like to be different. He wants to be grey like the rest of the herd. Elmer finds a way to paint himself black, but to his, and to the young reader's surprise nobody recognizes him now when he is just as anybody else. Elmer is used to being seen, and has to do a trick to the others to be seen again. And the ending is in great honor to Elmer, the different one. And he has taught us a wonderful story about the importance of being the one you are meant to be, not to pretend being someone else.<BR>The story has given us great opportunities to talk about the importance of being the one we are. We are created unique and our strength is in keeping this uniqueness.<BR>The story has wonderful, simple paintings, bright colored. My five year old and I have alot of fun making an applique quilt of Elmer and his life. This book is a jewel either you have chidren or not.
B00005N83M|3.0|Yes. 3 stars and moaning. The songs are good, but there are 'explicit lyrics' and also extra tracks. I take 1 star off for the explicit lyrics. I, personally, like explicit lyrics. I don't mind them. But I know other people may mind them so to warn them I have taken one star off. The other star goes off for some of the songs. There are some songs on there you will literally skip everytime you listen to the CD. I would take another star off because I don't think J.Lo should bother singing these songs, I don't think this is the best she can do. I do add back that star for putting on the great remix of 'I'm Real' with Ja Rule. Different lyrics, Ja Rule, nice beat. Great. The other 2 stars are for the good songs on there. So that brings me to 3 stars which let's all of you know, if you can't handle 'explicit' lyrics, get the CLEAN version. It does have the remix but the clean version does too now. In short: Like explicit lyrics- buy this one. Don't like them: buy the clean version. That's all folks!
B00003CXTG|2.0|It is too bad this film did not live up to its billing.  Too many inaccuracies mar what could have been a great film, given the budget and special effects (which are pretty good).  The characters don't develop through the movie and it leaves out why December 7, 1941 was important.  And the DVD is a bit expensive given all that.
B000002J0B|5.0|I was only 4 when this came out, but I remember it just being in the atmosphere at the time (ie; everyone in the neighborhood was blasting it from 8-track car stereos and on record players in every house. &quot;Houses....&quot; has lost none of it's walloping power and epic scope in the last 28 years and presents the world's biggest band at the peak of thier powers. &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; almost sounds like a different band as Jimmy Page plays more open, jangly chords and leaves the thunder to drummer John Bonham who sounds simply animalistic and primal throughout these 8 tracks. &quot;Rain Song&quot; is a plaintive, sweeping ballad that manages to be moving and not saccharine and features one of Robert Plant's most heartfelt vocals. &quot;Over The Hills and Far Away&quot; is a mini &quot;Stairway..&quot; performance that builds to a great crashing chorus, but doesn't linger too long.<br />The funky, chunky James Brown toss-off &quot;The Crunge&quot; is just plain fun, with the rhythm section showing off to great effect (Bassist/Keyboardist John Paul Jones is in fine form) and showing that these fellas have a sense of humor. &quot;Dancing Days&quot; could actually have given The Beatles a run for thier money with it's terrific, jangle-pop verses, catchy hook and tight playing by the band, it should have been a bigger hit!  &quot;D'yer Maker is a nice stab at reggae/ska and features a great, stomping tempo shift by Bonham, you'll love it. &quot;No Quarter&quot; is the menacing, dark masterpiece of the set. This track is a slow, ambient and shifting piece that lulls the listener into it's feeling of desperation and longing ('they carry news that MUST get through!') and has a killer riff that has been copied by a whole generation of axe-slingers. ATMOSPHERIC would be the best way to describe this gem. From his cockney-accented count in to the closing &quot;The Ocean&quot; John Bonham dominates the song with some of his funkiest, heaviest and creative drumming. Actually, the entire band lets it rip on this great song from Plant's shrieking vocals and acapella breakdown, to Page's grungy, funk-inspired riffing and concluding with a swinging doo-wop section highlighted by some very melodious bass playing courtesy of Jones, the album closes on a fun, high-spirited note. Led Zeppelin never stumbles on this LP, and found an eclectic and fresh new direction from this point on. Another Classic in a catalog loaded with them.ing.

B000059PPN|5.0|Yes I have been a Fulci fan since my mom took me to see Zombie in 1980. With house by the Cemmetery Fulci once again proved that he  would not be out done by any other horror film director.This movie is awesome and you don't have to a Fulci fan to appreciate his work.Just buy the movie put it in and hit the play button and you will witness what a true horror film really is.There is great gore in this film and the acting is a little stiff but this just adds to fun you'll have from watching a Lucio Fulci horror film and I dare you to sit through the last fifteen minutes of this movie and watch Dr. Fruedstein with his gruesome face and his maggot spewing body stalk the family in basement of the house. This has to be one of the most intense, terrifying moments I have ever seen in a horror film.Oh,and I almost forgot to mention when Dr. Fruedstein is injured he cries like a little 5 year old kid. Buy a Fulci horror film on DVD your collection won't complete without him
B00005B4GU|5.0|I'll be brief here. I simply can't get this wondrous CD off my mind. This masterpiece is worth owning for my favorite track, the gorgeous, haunting and tear-inducing &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;. Thom Yorke's voice just brings tears to my eyes. This band is producing some truly inspired and groundbreaking work, don't miss out or you'll be sorry. &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is a gem. That's all, I can't write anymore, I've got to hear my song again.......
0790736039|5.0|Ok, so its not as good as the book, but then Stephen King never intended it to be on the screen. I've read the book and seen the film, so here is my tip for complete enjoyment. Read the book first, then watch the film, there is some good acting here, and instead of criticising everything note how the clown is actually a very real, very scary foe, and also how lovely Jonathan Brandis (Bill Denbrough, age 12) is, that will take your mind off the poor adaptation! I think my fave bit of the movie, is when they come out of the sewers age 12, and they have the &quot;swear to me, that if it isnt dead, you'll all come back&quot; moment. The acting is great here, and you can totally feel the childhood ties, it's really sweet!! If you're supposed to read the book for school, then dont think you can wangle out of it by watching the film, its totally not the same at all, but i think the film adds a few nice touches that the book couldnt convey, but make sure that you read the book first, cos the film is good, and it might put you off reading it, cos it's a hell of a lot easier to sit for two hours than it is to plough your way through the heft of the novel, but believe me, its worth it, read the novel, it may take you a while, and your hands may shake as you turn the pages (i hid mine on several occasions cos it is a bit of a frightener) but at the end, i promise you will feel warm and fuzzy! magnificent book that a good film tried to be like, it's like britney spears trying to upstage madonna, we all know its not going to happen, but we enjoy ourselves watching her try! Sx.
6305278016|5.0|Have you seen &quot;The Duellists&quot; or &quot;Alien&quot;.. maybe &quot;Gladiator&quot; too... what can one say but admire a master at work. He can take the Roman Empire or the Yakuza in &quot;Black Rain&quot;, and just hit you  to surrender with a touch reserved for the great. Every time, Ridley Scott nails the subject..  grabs you and holds you over the edge... the actors are amazing and of course the Napa visuals... spectacular.
0719043263|5.0|Not too keen on studying theory?  Find yourself feeling a little sick at having to take on the likes of Foucault and Derrida?  Wishing there was an easier to way to grasp theory?  Read this book.  It is wonderfully readable and accessible, and refuses to be condescending to those of us who must study theory but would prefer not to.  This is not only informative, but useful.
B000002GEY|4.0|Well...This album easily deserve 4 stars. Then whether give it more than 4 is totally upto you. Personally, I prefer &quot;crime of the century&quot; to this but still it is a very enjoyable album.  Go get Paris (live, a great live!) and then COTC. Next choose would be Breakfast in America. <br />BTW, I am afraid what I can say when my children ask what is the twin buildings (world trade center) in lower manhattan(or just breakfast table?). Today was one of the most saddest day in my life.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|I like the Beatles, but theres no denying they had a lot of fluff.  It was simple, empty pop songs that got them into a position where they had the power to experiment and innovate (for such a large audience, anyway).<br />This hits compilation tracks mostly just the fluff, and it gets redundant before the CD is about half completed.
B00005NOZ6|5.0|I only recently was exposed to the music of Dream Theater. Since that time I have bought EVERYTHING I could find. I've been blown away time &amp; time again by their musicianship. I've nearly worn out the &quot;Metropolis 2000&quot; DVD from which this Live Recording is taken. And I have been waiting for this date to come, so I could purchase the CD. Then the day of its release came ... September 11th, 2001 And I purchased the disc, amidst the most horrifying news this country has ever witnessed. <br />I'm not going to comment on the disc, although it's as good as anything DT has ever done. But I just want you to look at the cover. I know its the same poster that they used to promote the Roseland concert a year before. But the fact that this CD came out on what will be known as America's second &quot;Day Of Infamy&quot; is just eery. I will continue to listen to the CD and enjoy DT's music. But I will never forget the day I bought it, and all I need do is look at the cover, and all of the events of this day will come flooding back. <br />My condolences to the families of the victims in New York &amp; Washington D.C. ...
B000002LBH|5.0|One of the most perplexing summations ever made about the Smiths was made by my father back in 1986 when he called their brilliantly self-eviscerating brand of brit-pop &quot;Depresso Rock.&quot; Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. The sustained popularity of the Smith's music (I am 30, and have been a fan for half my life) derives from its ability to uplift, not depress. There is giddiness that bubbles just below the surface of songs like Girlfriend in a Coma or Shoplifters of the World. Perhaps it is Mars'  jangly, tremulous guitar work, or perhaps it is the relative absurdity of Morrissey (a grown man, after all) kicking through puddles of self-loathing, but something about the Smith's music always makes me feel better about myself.

B0000024SI|5.0|If you only get two Bob Dylan CDs, they should be &quot;Freewheelin'&quot;, and &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;.  The first is the best example of his early, simple folk music.  And this one is a perfect example of his rockin' side (not that it doesn't have it's fair share of folk and social commentary).  For most of 'Highway' he is plugged in, and peforming some of the finest songs of his career.<br />BTW - if you get only three Bob Dylan albums, make the third &quot;Time Out Of Mind&quot;.
1566870631|5.0|This movie is a perfect example of Ingrid in her pre-hollywood innocent days. I love her Swedish movies because she's always the innocent little girl that everyone loves. She is a young piano podigy who supports herself by teaching piano lessons. She falls in love with her student's father who is a famous violin player. She runs away with him, but being sweet, moral Ingrid, leaves because she can't have an affair with a married man. She actually plays the piano in this movie, and quite beautifully. I've seen the English version as well and I prefer the Swedish one.  A must-see for any Bergman fan.
B000001FSP|3.0|A powerful moving album that ocasionally goes over the edge. At it's best it's wonderful (Broken English, Lucy Jordan) and it's most excessive (Why'd You Do It) it does veer into the down-right depressing. But it's well worth the purchase. If Bette Davis had made a rock album, this is what it would have sounded like.
B000002KGT|5.0|OK, if you want good introduction to Fleetwood Mac (the Buckingham-Nicks years) go to their self-titled album first.  Once you have a proper appreciation of that get Rumours--their best album.  You have great downbeat songs like Dreams and Go Your Own Way about the Stevie's breakup with Lindsey, and also Christie McVie's upbeat tunes like Don't Stop (if you can disassociate it with President Clinton's election). If you've listened to any classic rock station, you should be familiar with most of the songs.  Lesser known tracks like The Chain and Gold Dust Woman are as good--if not better--than the album's more popular songs.
B00003CXWV|5.0|Great movie.  One of the best true stories related to the drug world I have ever seen.  Johnny Depp was awesome.  Penelope Cruz was great.  I thought the white dvd case was a good touch since the movie is about George Jung and his pushing of cocaine
6305662355|5.0|After buying this collectors edition set i feel i have spent my money very wisely.The DVD itself has a great interview with Bruce Lee which I had only seen brief clips of before and it was very imformative.The film itself,again as you all know is one of Bruce Lee's best,only slight draw back is that it is a double sided DVD but this you can put up with.The extras inside the box are great,the book on Enter The Dragon was again very imformative also the pictures,postcards etc were all very done.<br />This is a must buy for Bruce Lee fans .
B00005NWM3|4.0|Nickelback's second album, &quot;Silver Side Up,&quot; shows maturity and growth from the band's first LP, &quot;The State.&quot;  Not only are the songs on &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; about serious issues, such as the ups and downs of relationships (&quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot;), and abuse (&quot;Never Again&quot;), they are also extremely catchy and radio worthy.  The album's first single, &quot;How You Remind Me,&quot; is already flowing through stations everywhere and is currently #2 on the Billboard Modern Rock Chart.  Nickelback did get some radio play with their breakthrough single, &quot;Leader of Man,&quot; but the attention the band is receiving now is nothing compared to their debut success.<br />Nickelback is following the footsteps of bands such as Staind and Linkin Park by introducing their music to a wider audience.  If the first week sales for &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; compare to Staind's &quot;Break the Cycle,&quot; Nickelback will soon become a household name in alternative music.<br />The ten songs on &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; are all amazing, however &quot;How You Remind Me,&quot; &quot;Woke Up This Morning,&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot; are the tracks that stand out the most.  If you purchase this album, and you are a new Nickelback fan, make sure to check out the band's first album, &quot;The State.&quot;  You will not be disappointed in both efforts.
B000001FSP|3.0|A powerful, moving album that ocasionally goes over the edge.

If Bette Davis had made a rock album, this is what it would have sounded like.
B000002KD5|4.0|OK, so we know this album isn't as good as Rumours...so what!  The problem with Rumours is that almost every song has become a standard so it's difficult to feel like you're discovering new material.  Of course, Fleetwood Mac has great standards too.  It might be the obvious choice, but Rhiannon is still my favorite song by the band.  Also on included is the unforgettable Landslide (although I've come to prefer the concert version).  However, the lesser-known songs like I'm So Afraid, Monday Morning, or Crystal make the album a real find.  It should be a companion-piece to Rumours because the band still has their &quot;early&quot; sound firmly in place.
B00005NOZ6|5.0|This cd is definitely superior to Once In A Livetime by a longshot. The sound quality is much better and this show was performed very close to perfection. They do a lot of stuff on this show that wasn't done on the rest of this tour, like the choir on &quot;The Spirit Carries On&quot;, and of course the live narrator on those parts from Scenes From A Memory. Also, very well-played complete live versions of &quot;A Mind Beside Itself&quot; and &quot;A Change Of Seasons&quot;. It's 3 cds long and it's all the same show, which is one of the things I look for in live cds. If you have to choose between this and OIAL, I recommend this one. If you're a Dream Theater fan, you definitely won't be disappointed. If you don't know much about Dream Theater, get their studio stuff first.
B00003CXE7|1.0|The Oscars have sold out. This is just a copy of Braveheart. Anyone who saw &quot;Quills&quot; knows that Geoffrey Rush's performance was astondingly better than anything in this movie. Between Gladiator and Titanic, the Acadamy has lost all credibility.

Anthony Bourdain's view on basically about everything is extremely funny and witty.

6304057709|5.0|This movie is basically about 2 sisters who are looking for love..1 loves a man who will lose his fortune if he marries one sister and the other who has two men who love her one of good character and one who has Sullied womens good names...It's much more to the movie..but I don't want to ruin it for new viewers..Excellent Film...
B00005NI5Y|5.0|The direction that Dylan went in when he recorded &quot;Love and Theft&quot; could not have been any better.  Not wholly unlike &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; in its subject matter, it represents a completely different take on the material.  Above all, Dylan sounds relaxed and comfortable...  not to mention the fact that he really has never recorded music quite like this.  Songs that should stand out are &quot;High Water&quot;, &quot;Po Boy&quot;, &quot;Sugar Baby&quot;, &quot;Moonlight&quot;, and pretty much everything else.  Just an amazing human being.
B00003CXDG|2.0|You don't have to make a good movie to earn money. A cool trailor is all you need! After so long I still can't overcome from the anger of being cheated (for both money and time). The movie is completely drowned by John Woo's ego of &quot; to show some cool stuff to those corny viewers&quot;.
0792842499|5.0|In a world where true humanty is caged with rules of conduct, Clint, Sergio, Wallach and Angel Eyes are the doormen to the stark reality of human nature. Anarchy thrives in a place where man is shown in his true form - where \\"...life is nasty, brutish and short.\\" Reality is suspended when the \\"Good\\" is a thief, the \\"Bad\\" is an officer, and the \\"Ugly\\" is truly a lovable ruffian. I love this movie for it's hammer of subtlety and it's brave conviction of the baser side of humanity.

B00003CXE7|3.0|I like the movie. It has stars in it in the old fashioned<br />sense of the word. Mr Crowe only seems to get better. Joachim<br />Phoenix was a revelation - but the Devil always has<br />the best tunes. I don't think I can remember Richard Harris<br />being better since &quot;The Field&quot;. Connie Nielsen is so beautiful.<br />But the great acting comes from the late Oliver Reed. The movie<br />was a fitting last movie for him.<br />The movie looks great - it is literally (how I hate that word),<br />....spectacular.<br />But so were the games themselves - pure spectacle. And I am<br />afraid that I want something more than simple visual thrills<br />( even though you get those in spades ).<br />The movie is weakened as soon as Maximus reveals his identity to<br />Commodus - which happens way too soon. Then the movie becomes<br />completely incredible from that point. Because all the Emperor<br />would have done on learning his old enemy was still alive is<br />have him killed. No one would have questioned that. He was<br />Emperor. He had the Praetorian Guards. No one would have<br />publicly questioned the poisoning of a lowly gladiator.<br />But of course, that would not make for such an enjoyable filmic<br />experience.

Clint may have some good zinging one<br />liners, but McQueen is the eptiome of cool.<br />In the famous ( and still the best ) car chase, he hardly<br />seems concerned. His scenes with Robert Vaughn as the oily<br />DA are great.<br />There is no one comparable to McQueen even on the movie radar<br />screen right now. Not even on the edge.
6303913881|4.0|This movie is very exciting..Elizabeth Berkeley portrays the roll of Nomie Malone an ex call girl tryin to make it in Vegas as a dancer...Along the way she meets a friend...a lover and a woman who wants to hold her back..Nomie soon finds out Vegas is not just a town full of games..
B00003CXSP|3.0|In \\"The Silence Of The Lambs\\", Dr Lecter was way more<br />chilling and scary. Here he is just an invincible<br />bogey man. Where is his erudition?<br />Shucks! Must have left it in Italy - at the lecture.<br /><br />Of course I am a fan of the ending of the book, so I<br />wanted this movie to be better.<br /><br />Julianne Moore gives a very creditable performance as<br />Starling. There was nothing here ( unlike the book ) to<br />make Jodie Foster shy away from playing Clarice again.<br />Now let us see if Mr Harris writes another book how the<br />movie makers can reconcile it to the completely botched<br />ending of the movie.<br /><br />The chemistry between Lecter and Starling from the first movie<br />is completely lacking. But it does seem to have been<br />transferred to the scene at the opera between Lecter and Passi's<br />wife. You could imagine him killing Passi for being an ignorant<br />boor. I cannot imagine him killing his wife - so the line that<br />begins \\"I was was thinking of......\\" now only has one possible<br />interpretation.
6304578482|5.0|This is one of the whole families favorite movies...Romy and Michele are off to there class reunion...But they don't think that they have made much of themselves so they come up with a hair brain scheme to make people think they are, &quot;Business Women&quot;.  This movie is too funny...They have Flashbacks to High School..Even look into the future..Great Music from the 80's..Check them out singin Footloose in the Car..U will Bust a Gut....
B00000CQJZ|5.0|Robert Donat is excellent as the innocent man on the run.<br />Hitchcock produced a masterpiece of suspense and tension.<br />Of course &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; of the movie are not at all the<br />same as &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; of the book, but that is OK.<br />The movie stands on its own merit and it is rightly<br />recognized as a classic.<br />The chemistry between Madeleine Carroll and Robert Donat<br />is great and modern film makers should note that the only<br />clothing removed are her stockings.<br />Highly recommended, even after all these years.
6300263673|5.0|I had this movie since it came out on video tape...Patrick Swayze is so fine in this movie..He is a dancer at a posh country club..He has a dance partner who gets herself &quot;In Trouble&quot;, as they would say back in the day and he needs a temporary partner until she can get back on her feet from an abortion....So he gets a non dancin big nose girl to be his partner...He falls in love with her...But her father thinks Patrick is bad to the bone and not good enough for his daughter...
B00000JGHM|5.0|In the theater, the big bank robbery scene is the<br />LOUDEST shootout I have ever heard.<br />Pacino is great in this, but De Niro is better.<br />He is a cold blooded, quite ruthless robber, who<br />is shown as such and yet, we the audience like him.<br />We like him a lot.<br />Of course as this is an American movie, he has to<br />pay in the end, but that's OK. Strangely and I cannot<br />really explain it, my sympathy slowly leaches over to<br />Pacino as the movie progresses and though the De Niro<br />character is still itself sympathetic, I do not see<br />the end of the movie as tragic.<br />Now that seems to me to be bravurra film making.<br />Mr Mann is on top top form here.
B00000IQUT|3.0|I bought this movie because when I was younger, I snuck downstairs and watched part of this movie when my sisters were having a slumber party...When i started watching the movie this time I thought..these actors are horrible..and the best part is how she gets her revenge on them for the rape..Other than that,,this movie [is bad]!!
0790720434|4.0|This remake of the classic title was a disappointment at the box office and no one knows why. It's exactly what parents say they're looking for in a kids' movie. Perhaps it's because many think of it as a &quot;girl's movie.&quot; We found that both boys and girls identified with characters on many levels - losing parents, being part of a family and learning to understand one another's feelings. It's a wonderful, universal story. Kids are inspired and moved by the emotions each character goes through. They commented: &quot;No matter what your problems are, you can overcome them.&quot; &quot;It must have been shot in a big garden. It was neat.&quot; &quot;Awesome, it was the best video ever!&quot; Best for 7 to 12-year-olds.

Shows<BR>many cultures and races. Our kids connected with the story, loved the music and the lyrics. They commented: &quot;We watched it three times in a row.&quot; &quot;Can I watch it before bed?&quot; &quot;I like the music.&quot; &quot;I like the bunny.&quot; &quot;I love the monster.&quot; &quot;I learned about dreams.&quot; Perfect for pre-schoolers - 2 to 5-year-olds.
B00004VVNC|5.0|This is one oof my favorite period movies..It's about 3 brothers with a domineering father..Who all fall for the same woman..which tears the family apart...Brad Pitt who plays Tristan Lulowe is a sexy as can be in this film...
B000002IOW|3.0|I would not consider it typical Rush type music.  I like it because I'm a Rush fan but it is not my favorite.  I think the best songs are Show Don't Tell and Superconductor.  If your looking for a Rush album to by and have never heard anything but Tom Saywer then don't buy this it just might turn you off because it does not have the same drive and sound.  I recommend for first time Rush listeners to buy Moving Pictures, Power Windows, Signals, or Counterparts.

0312932081|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read. I think everyone should read it, especialy people who love science fiction. The first couple chapters are kind of boring, but it gets better later in the book. Take the time to read this book it's very good.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Wow, this album is incredible.  I would love to go into a long review/breakdown of every track on this album, but my praises could not do this record justice.  Their first wide release record &quot;The State&quot; was awesome, but &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; blows it out of the water.  It has currently knocked &quot;Break The Cycle&quot; by Staind from the top of my 2001 albums list.  Great job guys.
B00005B6C9|5.0|I asked for this CD for my birthday and what a treasure it is. I did not know any of the music before I listened the first time. I now keep the CD player on repeat so I can listen over and over. The songs are catchy and wonderful gems. My favorite selections are &quot;Wedding Day&quot;, Sacred Trust&quot; and Deja Vu&quot;. If you like the Bee Gee's music old or new, this CD will be a great addition to your collection. My husband and 2 sons, 12 and 16 also are enjoying this collection.
6305137293|2.0|Halloween II picks up exactly where Halloween left off.  It starts with a recap of the originals ending. Survivor Laurie Strode is sent to the local hospital where she is put to sleep and remains drugged for what little time she is on the screen. The main part consists of Michael Myers killing various hospital employees and Dr. Loomis's search for him. This movie is necessary in order to understand future sequels. It reveals that Laurie is Michael's sister, though writer John Carpenter admits this point came to him late one night when he had a bad case of writer's block. Halloween II contains a lot more blood and gore and feels like a regular crazy guy kills people film.  From what I know, the older Goodtimes dvd, which I bought for five dollars, contains much of the same as the new Universal twenty dollar dvd. The new disc contains a new anamorphic transfer (enhanced for widescreen TV's) and a theatrical trailer, which is not very good accorging to dvdreview.com.
B00005LMWI|5.0|I always thought that Kamelot was a so-so power metal band. Let's say a&quot;good&quot; power metal band. But in their last two cd's , they have improved a lot. The best thing happened when Sascha Paeth handled the production therefore giving new life to this band. The production was the BEST ever in the history of this band. Now Kamelot is between my collection of power metal cd's. Tracks like &quot;Forever&quot;, &quot;Don't you cry&quot; and &quot;The Spell&quot; are bettween my favorites....for now. This cd has all a power metal listener likes. So, what are you waiting for!!! Buy it!!
006092988X|5.0|This book takes the reader on a voyage through memories so heartfelt you will feel like you have become a part of the Nolan family. The story is of an Irish Catholic family bringing up their children in the heart of Brooklyn during the beginning of the century. Francie and her brother Neeley are characters that you will take away with you, never to be forgotten.<br />Life is hard and times are poor, but love of family and a good moral upbringing by the ever-present, yet distant mother Katie, gets them through. Life in Brooklyn struggles along with a laugh and a song from their drunken father Johnny who tries his best. With love and respect they watch their fathers decline over the years. Life is a roller coaster of emotions, trials, and tribulations, all layed out by the author in a manner that will keep you reading late into the night.<br />This book was written back in the 40s and is as much a classic today as it ever was. It continues to reach people into the new millennium. Though the century may change the lessons remain the same, love of family, strength of character, honesty, and hard work. The American Dream is there for the having and this book exemplifies it. Bravo a truly worthwhile read for everyone.  Kelsana 9/11/01<br />,
B000002J2B|5.0|This album was the second (and last, unfortunately) album that Genesis released as a quartet.  Steve Hackett would leave after the release of this album and the live collection &quot;Seconds Out&quot;.  When I first bought this CD, I was expecting to hear something fairly similar to the other &quot;quartet&quot; album, &quot;Trick of the Tail&quot;.  Wow!  I couldn't have been more wrong.  Whereas &quot;Trick&quot; showcased Steve Hackett's guitar, &quot;Wind and Wuthering&quot; is much more (to me) focused on Tony Banks and his keyboards.  &quot;Eleventh Earl of Mar&quot; leads the album off strongly, but is quickly overshadowed by the awesome &quot;One for the Vine&quot;, a 10-minute epic of sound with a middle section that is the best instrumental Genesis has EVER done.  After these two tracks, the album stops to catch its breath with the pretty little track &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot;, a short love song that is a definite perlude to the Genesis sound of the '80s.  &quot;Wot Gorilla?&quot; is a short little throwaway instrumental, not much to it, but pleasant to listen to anyway.  &quot;All in a Mouse's Night&quot; is an interesting song about a mouse hunting for food and trying to avoid the cat (I get visions of Tom and Jerry in my head whenever I hear this one - it's hard not to).  After a return to the style of the first two tracks with &quot;Blood on the Rooftops&quot;, the album finishes strong with the trio &quot;Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers/In That Unquiet Earth/Afterglow&quot; - these three songs blend together so well that at first listen, they seem to be one song - it reminds one of the song structure to &quot;Supper's Ready&quot;.  All good tracks, but for me, nothing comes close to &quot;One for the Vine&quot;.  The CD is worth owning for that single track alone.
0060922583|3.0|I read Michael Talbot's book over six months ago. As a general practice I defer writing a review until I am confident my opinion has stabilized. Typically that occurs by the time I reach the final page. This time I was all over the map and in reality (I guess) I still can't state with assurance how valid I found his speculations. Yet, I also cannot overlook the subtle adaptations in perceptiveness I have experienced over that period.<br /><br />Mr. Talbot's text is a quasi-credulous compendium of New Age philosophy and conventional scientific investigation, a Vulcan mind meld of Carlos Castaneda and Stephen Hawking. I just might be too left-brained to acquiesce to his exhortations even though past experience has indicated my cognitive distributive ratio lies closer to evenly balanced. One salient distinction I recognize is I am not nearly as unsettled by my incapability to find explanations for all that occurs in what I believe to be the tangible observable world.  Immanuel Kant depicted a noumenal world inexplicable to or by the corporeal being. Talbot is a \\"demi-Aristotelian\\" of implicated essences that while they can be abstracted most of us have lost the power to distinguish them.  He is careful to remain within theistic dogma as he never directly challenges a spiritual imperative.  The holographic model of vision infers an undefined, omnipotent presence(s) at the impetus of all phenomena; any differences are attributable to how our cognition unfolds.<br /><br />I will grant under the premises of this theory, most of the knowledge I have acquired over the years, and nearly all I have retained does serve as interfering influences to objective acceptance of all of his postulations regarding the holographic paradigm.  The first two chapters of Mr. Talbot's book appear completely supportable by conventional scientific principles. Thereafter, he progressively moves from speculative to the metaphysical to the numinous and protean spirituality, by the time he reached his concluding sections my mind had turned to stone. Although out of body/ near death experience is foreign to me, I have no doubt personal encounters would result in an entirely different outlook. Likewise, stigmata, telekinesis and the plausibility of multiple parallel universes are all intriguing, but Mr. Talbot simply did not present explanations I found to be anymore valid than those we currently find questionable. It was his discussion of synchronicities, those coincidences that are so unusual and so meaningful they could hardly be attributed to chance alone that compelled me to try to soften my brain's rigidity.  For inexplicable reasons, two subjects in the book made very strong impressions upon me although neither area was of significant length or major importance: the physical properties of neutrino subatomic particles that seem to morph to correspond to the physicists interpretations of them, and the minds' ability to create what we see while not necessarily generating an accurate reproduction of what we think we are observing.<br /><br />As I sat down to submit this review for at least the fourth time, I happened upon a copy of a popular science magazine where the two lead stories were concerned with the very same subjects.  Quite possibly, enhanced awareness of newly or recently discovered information would typically result in heightened awareness, yet the confluence of events does infer reevaluation with reduced incredulity.<br /><br />As  Talbot states \\"science already accepts what is probable about very important matters if those matters fall into the category of \\"fashionable things to believe\\" but not if they fall into the category of \\"unfashionable things to believe.\\" My categorical dismissal just might be recalcitrance to change. Nothing is lost by reading the book. You may end up seeing things that were always there.ctions my mind had turned to stone.

0896760839|5.0|This is a costumers bible. All the detail that will make or break a historical piece. It has wonderful background information and documentation as well as clear drawings and notes. The highlight is a collection of expandable patterns for a large assortment of complete ensembles. If your looking for just making Elizabethean outfits, this is way too much information. If you are ready for the &quot;Next Level&quot; of ultra historical clothing or working on a professional level, buy this book. I'm sure it will end up as dogeared as mine.
B000055ZDT|4.0|My first reaction to this when I put it on (bought without hearing first), was to laugh. I couldn't believe the sound that was coming out of my speakers. Imagine the cheapest, [...] transister radio, turned up way too loud, then amplify that sound,beef up the bottom end, and uh yeah now you have the guitar sound. I should state for the record (no pun intended) that I am not strictly a doom, or even metal fan exclusively. I tend to go with whatever rattles my chain, whatever \\"genre\\" it comes from. And as I listened with awe, my chain did indeed rattle (as did my fillings). The songs improve as the CD crawls onward,,,, and onward. As a non partaker of drugs, I don't enjoy all stoner bands, but the ones i enjoy, I LOVE. It just has to stand alone without chemical enhancement. So I have to say this definitely ROCKS. It's just that it rocks like a Brontosaurus on Mogadon. So by all means buy, but don't take it too seriously, and laugh along as your stereo self distructs!
B00005A46T|5.0|Their first CD was a blast, everyone knows that CD changed the music industry. After those years they had to come up with a new CD. And they did a very good job. <br />People always feel the need to compare CD's. Don't compare, this CD is a new piece of art. It's an individually standing CD. No connections to the first CD rather then being recorded by the same record company and the same artists.<br />The album is a very nice album, and I listen to it alot. The booklet is made of some nice paper, the cover is a nice looking goat. Be sure you read their statement in the booklet.<br />I've read some other reviews on this site and people start comparing to the first album anyways, no one can stop that. But think on some of the bands of these days: Limp Bizkit, KoRn etc. Those bands create almost exact copies of earlier CD's, and people judge that. Now a band (Slipknot) does something new and it shouldn't be compared, cause it so different, and the first thing people do is compare it to the last CD and get conclusions out of that.<br />This CD is so worth it to be bought! It's very good! Go buy it!
B00005NWM3|5.0|Awesome awesome awesome CD.  I saw them in concert 4 days ago and already knew they were awesome and they just blew me away even more.  If you like Rock and want Rock to be number one again like it should buy this album it's awesome every song on it.  You already know &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; and know it's awesome and that song is good enough for the price of this whole cd.  Even more outstanding I think is &quot;Good Times Gone&quot; it sounds like it just came out of the great LED ZEPPELIN but with a little twist.  10 awesome songs compacted in to one amazing cd.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This album rides in on the strength of their Radio Campaign for &quot;How you remind me&quot;, the lead off single...and the rest of the album is just as good. Driving hard rock mixed with catchy sing-a-long choruses and hooks. Without being obviously depressing, some songs on the album have a very haunting feel to them. Brilliant. The album is solid from front to back, and worthy of your money.
1577311760|5.0|I feel that Eckhart Tolle makes a strong case for paying attention to the obvious, in paying attention to our &quot;not-so-common&quot; common sense. He is the first to state that he is saying things that many spiritual leaders have said in the past, or perhaps ALL truly moving spiritual leaders have said. His work is in many ways a condensation of those teachings. He quotes Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, and others.<br />He states that all humans have the capacity to &quot;get it&quot;, that we are all beautiful people. It is easy to take his words at face value and not actually apply them. I listened to the audio version of his book. For those that feel he contradicts himself, the tapes might be useful: the words of the book are delivered in Tolle's own voice, with his inflections, melting some misunderstanding in phrasing choices. It is often easier to remember something he said 10 minutes ago than something you yourself read over 50 pages ago, and perhaps 2 days before.<br />I highly recommend Tolle's statement of the obvious. A truly powerful statement is a statement of the obvious, because it cuts through all the mental clutter, all the B.S., everything that keeps us from understanding.<br />Enjoy!
B00005N5SF|5.0|Plato's Stepchildren is one of my top four favorite episodes, along with Space Seed, the City on the Edge of Forever, and Mirror Mirror. I've been waiting a long time for it to be released on DVD and am very happy that it will be soon. It also has historic value in the fact that the first inter-racial kiss on national television took place in that episode. Don't let overly sarcastic commentary spoil your fun!
B00004Z459|5.0|I MUST ADMIT I BOUGHT THE CD FOR THE SONG CRAWLING I THOUGHT<BR>THIS SONG ALONE IS SO GREAT THAT IF ITS THE ONLY GOOD SONG ITS<BR>STILL WORTH THE MONEY BUT BOOM WHAT A SUPRISE ALL THE SONGS ARE<BR>AMAZING JUST PLAY IT AND DONT SKIP ANY TRACK ITS INCREDIBLE CD<BR>CANT EXPLAIN IT WITH WORDS YOU MUST LISTEN!!!
B000000OU0|5.0|Well, &quot;the GUYS&quot; did decide to &quot;Get Over It&quot;, and get down to &quot;The Heart Of The Matter&quot;; and weren't we,the fans the true beneficiaries of THAT attitudeand fact! &quot;Get Over It&quot; just slammed me back in time to prime Eagles full-tiltrock, and proved just once again what these guys are made of. (Also, the &quot;social commentary&quot; inherent in it tickled me. D. Henley at his forte' perchance?) The new stuff was pretty impressive, but then Timothy B. Schmit&quot;s soaring soprano always did give me goosebumps before, as it did exquisitely on &quot;Love Will Keep Us Alive.&quot; (as did their omnipresent,never disappointing harmonizing.) Also absolutely ADORED their re-workings of their &quot;classics&quot;, acoustics and &quot;paringthem down&quot;, plus slowing them down a tad worked wonderfully. And of course, being the inveterate perfectionists that they are, the sound was impeccable; whether it was their trademark rockers or ballads. I, personally, had been wishing, and hoping, and praying that &quot;the Reunion&quot; would occur for a LONG time. There wasn't one ioata of disappointment in me on ANY level concerning THIS cd. As far as I'm concerned,this baby is a &quot;must have&quot;, stand-on-it's-own-laurels-beauty&quot;; no matter whether you already own their complete (up to then, at least) discorophy or not! As I do, but I sure wouldn't part with this baby, no matter what I had priorly owned,up to; and including then. Period.&quot;Restore your soul music&quot; indeed, as well as giving me a huge upsurge of faith, in general. I want to thank them personally for that. Guess I did, huh?
B00004NRWH|5.0|Everybody else that reviews this CD seems to be overanalyzing it.  Plain and simple, this CD rocks, and one of the few that I can listen in my car on the way to work from front to back, over and over.  It's really that good.  If I had a complaint it would be that there's only 11 songs on the album.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Bob Dylan's recent 60th birthday received such reverential attention by the media that it came close to looking like they were eulogizing him. Au contraire. The man is alive and well, and thank goodness for that, because his newest album is a rollicking blast.<br />&quot;Love And Theft&quot; is even better than the brooding classic Time Out Of Mind: more musically diverse, extremely tightly performed, more optimistic, and best of all, funny as all get-go. I still can't get over the fact that he says &quot;booty call.&quot;<BR>It's fitting Dylan took the title from a book about minstrel music, because the new album is all about blues-based ballads; not so much the sappy definition of ballad (though there are a couple of those on here as well), but old-time storytelling ballads, circa the Harry Smith Anthology. And talk about theft: Bo Diddly, Eddie Cochrane, Dock Boggs, Leon Redbone, Hank Williams, and Blind Lemon Jefferson are but a few of the sounds heard on the record.<br />The special edition cd, whose digipak format makes it more aestheticaly pleasing, makes it more fascinating. Bob's 1961 recording of 'I Was Young When I Left Home' has him using that mock-grizzled voice he used at twenty; now his voiced is grizzled for real, and he seems to be thoroughly enjoying using it. He snarls deliciously on 'Lonesome Day Blues', 'High Water', and 'Cry A While', then croons like an ancient hobo on 'Bye And Bye' and 'Moonlight'. His best vocal performance has to be 'Mississippi', the best jewel in a collection of gems; his phrasing and intonations are dead-on.<br />Lyrically, Dylan is as scorching as ever, but this time a sly humour pervades his lines, and you can practically see his poker face as he delivers his lyrics like an old grifter. The album's best lyrics are in 'High Water', which reads like a blues version of Desolation Row with a bit of surrealism thrown in for good measure.<br />&quot;Love And Theft&quot; wouldn't be as great if it weren't for Dylan's outstanding backing band. Multi-instrumental dynamo Larry Campbell, bassist/musical director Tony Garnier, hotshot guitarist Charlie Sexton, and superb drummer David Kemper make up his best band since, well, The Band (organist Augie Meyers also provides effective keyboard punctuation). This is a group of musicians that has the chops to challenge Dylan night after night, and as a result his studio efforts have never sounded better.<br />The Bob Dylan of 1997 had him grappling with his own mortality, but today's Bob loves life again, and the new cd is the realisation of the image he's been cultivating since 1997, the travelling country-blues troubador, complete with a Lee Van Cleef mustachio. He's back, he feels good, thank you very much, and to rephrase his own song, he ain't goin' nowhere, and the world is all the better for it.
B00000K2SC|5.0|Every time I watch this movie I like it more!  The effects are breathtaking, the story is mindbogglingly good, the fight scenes are incredible - One of the few special effects movies I've seen where the effects enhance the story and never take away from it. It even has the worst actor of his generation and is still one of the best movies!  If you've never seen it you've really missed out!  Rent it immediatly!!!
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya is a brilliant musician and composer and this CD certainly exemplifies that fact. I saw her perform &quot;Only Time&quot; on the American Music Awards and I was astounded by her stellar performance-- in the midst of all of the tacky pop non-music, her performance certainly presented music as something deep and beautiful. Anyway, The CD is terrific and I listen to it all the time. I would recommend it to anyone. In a world where music has become cheap and shallow, this CD is a breath of fresh air.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is my personal favorite Beatles album. It's fun and flawless. You get one great song after another. &quot;Come Together&quot; is one of their best. It's even been done by Aerosmith and Michael Jackson. &quot;Somewhere&quot;, by George Harrison, is one of the best and prettiest songs they've ever done. A masterpiece. &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; is silly and entertaining. One of my favorites on the album. The second half of the album features much shorter songs that sorta all roll into each other without stopping. &quot;Polythene Pam&quot; and &quot;Mr. Mustard&quot; are the standouts of that bunch. And, of course, how could we forget &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot;. A masterpiece of pop music if ever there was one. There it is. A perfect Beatles album. This is a necessity!. Get it!.
B000009ED0|5.0|this album by kid rock is great!it definately beats \\"the history of rock\\" and \\"grit sandwiches for breakfast\\".the very best songs on this album are bawitdaba,cowboy,devil without a cause,i am the bull god,only god knows why,and F--K off.those are the very best songs on the album.the worst song on the album is \\"black chick,white guy\\".if you like kid rock a lot,and if its between the history of rock or devil without a cause,pick devil without a cause.this CD is worth the money buying.i have it and its great!.the history of rock is good too,but \\"devil without a cause\\"is a lot better.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|How can you possibly go wrong with this album?. It's kinda sad that an album filled with songs over 30 years old from a group that broke up over 30 years ago is the best and freshest album than most others released around the same time. Music just isn't the same these days. This album should take everybody back to a magical place and time. These songs are special. I know after listening to this album that one would wish that everything else was on here too. What a great album that would be!. I, for one, hope they come back with a sequel CD called &quot;2&quot;. This is a definite must for any music lover.
B00005NW02|5.0|system of a down is my favourite band and now toxicity is my favourite cd. i am not going to write a whole review of the cd cuz i dont know who would care to see other peoples opinions about cd's and concerts and stuff like that. but the best songs on the cd are, deer dance, X (multiply), ATWA (air, trees, wind, animals), shimmy, aerials ahhh nevermind you get the point jsut go out and buy the cd.
B000003S5H|4.0|My 14 month old child took some of her first steps to track 1,<BR>Le Femme d'Argent! She now walks free and gracefully! That track is just phenominal from opening organ to end. I need to play it again to her and see her reaction.<br />I first heard about Air from Tribune concert review at Chicago Metro. Wish I was at Show. I ordered Moon Safari. As old (42) eletronic music fan ( Kraftwerk, Soft Cell, 80s Depeche, Yaz, Silver Apples, Pre Dark Side of Moon PF, ORB etc.) and electronic engineer, I admire electronic music tinkers that can play real music. Moon Safari certainly brings the genre forward with a classical / pop influence.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|All the songs are really good on the album. Loads of hard work! Who cares about if one tiny song is shortened or something?? Just enjoy it! The only problem is that the videos and enhanced things for the computer are bad quality.. and simple.. but just buy this. You won't regret it.
B00005214X|4.0|&quot;All things must pass&quot; was my melancholy companion through much of my first two years of college. Few people would have guessed that George Harrison -- the invisible Beatle -- had this kind of album in him.<br />Sure, some of it is syrupy, even derivative, yet it evokes a time and place that has come and gone without many landmarks worth noting. Harrison obviously spent his one big shot at solo fame here.<br />There are songs that can make me cry and wonderful shifts in tempo and spirit. Guitars are George's specialty.<br />Spirits have faded a bit. Harrison's work seems less important now. But he had his moment.
B00005NOZ6|5.0|The version on &quot;Silent man&quot; is worth the price alone!! The Video of another day with beckenstein is killer as well...Even at low volumes in the car, the bass drum pumps, and the keyboards swell-speaking of Jordan- this CD does his Keyboard justice- its in complete stereo. Thanks Guys!!!!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|didn't know what to expect,  listened to the 30 sec clips on the old computer,  didn't like it, bought the cd, put it on the cd player and am lovon it... my suggestion...buy it, listen, dance....<BR>thanks bob
6304139586|5.0|After a long time between viewing for me I found Hook better than ever. Spielberg did it again. Like many of his others he has created a truly magical and inspiring film which will be utterly amazing to a children and hysterical and heartfelt to adults. <br />Containing some of the best performances I have seen and almost faultless casting ( lost boys were a bit off, and pans son drives you up the wall ),  it includes Robin Williams - as the pan &quot;who did grow up&quot; into a middle aged overweight lawyer, Bob Hoskins - as the utterly lovable pirate smee, Julia Roberts - as tinkerbell and Maggie Smith - as a touching older Wendy. The movie however is stolen by Dustin Hoffmans rendition of - Captain Hook. Talk about an actor made for a role, Hoffman doesn't falter once, he is fantastic. Deviant but charming throughout he times some clever one-liners perfectly and makes you feel privileged to seen such phenomenal acting.<br />With the help of spectacular scenery ( Hooks ship and the North symbol in the ocean are particular favorites ), fantastic costumes ( excluding Tinkerbells party dress - looked like it came out of an opshop )  and some of the funniest dialogue you will hear ( Hooks me, me, me, my, my, my, now, now, now speech for one ) you'll be screaming &quot;Good form&quot; in no time.<br />So forget what the critics said on its release ( they are always wrong anyway ) and trust the viewers for I have never met one who doesn't love this movie. You will love it.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|&quot;High Water&quot; belongs with some of Dylan's best. &quot;Sugar Baby&quot; is also wonderful. The rest of the CD is fun and sounds closer to Tom Waits than the Dylan of the mid-sixties. Great to hear a legend back with the same edge that we've come to expect from his songs.
B00003CXWV|3.0|Johnny Depp proves once again that he can portray just about anyone in &quot;Blow,&quot; a story based on the life of George Jung the first American drug traffiker to bring Cocaine into the USA from Colombia on a major scale. Depp's style of acting is really anti-acting in that he literally becomes the part he is playing much like Marlon Brando, James Dean and Paul Newman who came out of the New York's Actors Studio. His style of acting is very natural, though with little of the seams and krinkles we see in Brando or Dean's performances. Depp also makes daring choices: how different can his chracter in &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; be from his character in &quot;Chocolat&quot; or here in &quot;Blow?&quot; Depp is the best thing about &quot;Blow&quot; despite director Ted Demme's dreary, lackluster pacing. Penelope Cruz who plays Mirtha, Jung's wife, heretofore has been a whirlwind of talent and sexiness, but in &quot;Blow&quot; she is merely drugged out,petulant and mostly boring. Check her out in &quot;Woman on Top&quot; or &quot;Some things about my Mother&quot; to witness Cruz at her best: earthy, smart and sensual like a young Sophia Loren. Franka Potente as Barbara comes off best after Depp proving that she can also play a kind, warm-hearted chracter very much in love with George. &quot;Blow&quot; only succeeds because of Depp and Potente and to a smaller degree Paul Reubens as Derek. It's interesting to note that the real George Jung, who will be released from prison in 2015, had never heard of Depp before this film!
0385474547|5.0|Chinua Achebe is a great story writer. In his novel, he tried to express the fear, feeling, and anger of the natives that were being colonized. What a wonderful job he has done, in telling the story through the native's eye by making the readers walk in the natives shoe. ***** Mefti
B000021YQV|5.0|I greatly anticipated this cd for a long time and that wait was justified.  Their first cd was very good, but this one is a whole lot better.  This one has more of a diversity.  It has singing, screaming and some great guitar and drums, which all blend together masterfully.  Serj has a great voice, no one can go from screaming to singing to whispering and back like he can.<BR>They are unique and no one else is like them.  The best song is Chop Suey, it is better than Sugar.  Others that are good: Prison Song, Needles, X, Forest and Atwa.  If you buy this cd, you will not be wasting your money, so go buy it.
B00003CX8J|4.0|As an X-Men fan, I liked the fact that they finally hit the big-screen (Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart ROCK!). As a movie fan, I applaud Bryan Singer for concentrating on the criss-crossing relationships between the characters (though I wish Storm had gotten more screen time). And as a DVD fan, I hope a &quot;specialer&quot; edition comes out with director commentary, but it's fine. The &quot;Making Of&quot; and screen test are nice touches.<br />But, what about the &quot;easter eggs&quot;? I won't give away what you'll see, but look closely on the trailers and still gallery menus. The ice rose and Wolvie's dog tags... Hmmm...
B00000IMCW|5.0|George Romero's cult classic.....buy it!!  Remake in the works, so check out the orignal ....
B000002WPI|5.0|Not only is this album a masterpiece, it's also a turning point for the east coast rap scene.  Right from the beginning this album displays its unique beats, and multi-talented rappers.  RZA,GZA,Ol' Dirty Bastard,Inspectah Deck, U-God, Ghostface killah &amp; Method Man the whole original Wu-Tang clan is there to drop lyrics like bombs (sorry couldn't help myself).  &quot;C.R.E.A.M&quot;, &quot;Method Man&quot;, &quot;Protect Ya Neck&quot; are some of the standout songs on the album, but once I give the album a 5 star rating it pretty much means every track is good.  Pick it up for an east coast masterpiece.
B00005K3NY|4.0|Movie Summary: Cameron Vale is jerked from his life as a mentally ill homeless man and whisked away to a corporate building. There he is given a drug that stops the voices in his head. He is told that he is not insane but he is one of only a few people with special mental powers. He is a Scanner. The corporation and its head scientist Doctor Paul Ruth clean up and attempt to train Cameron. They then send out an under prepared Cameron into the middle of a scanner war to track down a very powerful scanner who has plans to conquer the world.<br />My Opinion:  Almost all the reviews for Scanners call it a Horror movie. I don't agree. To me Horror suggests movies like &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;. Scanners has some gore which more than likely is what gets it the horror label. I found it to be an Action Thriller with major SciFi elements. It's also a detective/spy type mystery film. It's all these elements together that make Scanners interesting and entertaining. The plot gets a little confusing in the middle as Cameron searches for other scanners, but our confusion mirrors Cameron's and is intentional. As things progress everything becomes clear. Stephen Lack is excellent as the weird scanner hero. I liked him enough to go look up what other films he has been in. Patrick McGoohan and Michael Ironside also give great performances. Overall this is a very entertaining movie that I will watch more than once and recommend to others.<br />DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen anamorphic - 1.85:1  Sound:  DD 2.0 Mono. For at least the last quarter of the movie the sound does not sync up with the video. Extras: Trailer only. This is a bare bones DVD with Audio problems, but it is offered at a VHS price.<br />What You Should Do:  Buy the DVD if you are a fan of this movie or of Horror/ScFi movies in general. It's not a high quality DVD release, but the price isn't going to make your head explode.<br />Related Movies To Check Out:  Three Days of the Condor, Reanimator, Bride of Reanimatorhe Condor, Reanimator, Bride of Reanimator
B000053VAF|5.0|kevin smith is a god. this is a great movie. this comedy is not worth missing. jay and silent bob are great.  the whole story is great and plot makes sense.  if your religious do not take seriosly k. just sit back and enjoy.
B000002N1E|5.0|With this CD Prince declared not only was he back (well sort of, he was still called O(-+&gt; then), but he was back with a vengance.  The sounds on this CD just tear though you.  It's loud and raccus and the best part is Prince is back to playing guitar!  He's such a talented guitar player and it's terrific (and long overdue) to hear those talents featured once again.<br />The presentation of the music is set up to be like you're clicking your way through some cyber world, dipping into the various 'experiences'.  A computer-like voice introduces the CD and is heard many times throughout along with keyboard punches and assorted beeps and blips.  It's a great idea, but one that might ultimatley date the CD.<br />Fortunately the music included here will wipe out any bad taste left by the computer host.  Things start off with a bang with the rocking 'P Control' and 'Endorphinmachine' before hitting the gentle groove of 'Shh'.  'We March' is a song about racism, that offers some interesting lyrics, but is probably the weakest song here.  &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World' gets a much more guitar and drum based treatment than what was heard on the radio and 'Dolphin' is all about rebirth, transformation and reincarnation.  'Now' and '319' are so full of energy and immediacy, they drag you to the dancefloor and won't let go.  'Shy', 'Billy Jack Bitch' and 'I Hate U' form a trilogy of sorts.  Telling the story of meeting a girl, falling for her and then the messy relationship that follws.  It's raunchy, it's raw and it's pure heaven to hear!  The CD closes with 'Gold' which is anthemic like 'Purple Rain' and 'The Holy River' but surpasses them in that it feels so urgent.<br />That's the one thing that stands out to me.  This is an urgent sound.  I've never heard Prince sound like this.  It's a sound of such heartfelt energy that it just HAS to be heard, and it has to be heard NOW.  It's an amazing experience.  A GOLD experience.  Don't miss out on it.
B00003CXIP|5.0|if you have ever had a friend and you and that friend did something crazy you should check this movie out.  this movie is quality friendship film. i recommend this good movie to 99% of you.
B000002MT0|5.0|This CD is not for everyone. It's sexually explicit, it's violent and it's fairly dark and depressing. If you're not ready to go to these places you will not appreciate the artisty shown here. However if you are, you will be treated to a most unique and unforgettable expreience.<br />From the outset you know this is not a regular CD. 'Come' is a 10 minute plus track that hooks you from te beginning then just pulls you across it's melodies. You're not going to want to play it in front of your grnadmother, but it's one tight jam and the lyrics (When I blow that mind baby, I'm gonna drive you crazy) are classic Prince. 'Space', 'Phermone' and later 'Letigo' are the radio friendly songs included here. They are mid tempo, easy going songs that put the focus on the lyrics. Suddenly we are thrown into the land of techno and raves with 'Loose!'. It's the one high energy dance cut included. The sudden change is jarring but serves to introduce us to the more introspective, dark and violent songs. 'Papa' tells a story of abuse that some have speculated is autobiographical. The obligatory break up song comes in the form of 'Dark'. 'Solo' is sung mostly acapella and is hauntingly beautiful in it's depression. The CD closes with 'Orgasm' wich isn't a song at all, but, well just what you'd expect form a track with that title.<br />This is very much a concept album. Although not every song is depressing or tragic, you come away with that feeling. Maybe it's the dark, brooding packaging with it's proclimation of Prince's death (1958-1993). But the CD is full of sexual energy (be it titilating, seductive, or violent), head bobbing grooves, beautiful melodies and thoughtful lyrics.
B00000IQC8|4.0|first off this was my life till i saw this film. &quot;im not supose to be at work today.&quot; very funny more wow great film great characters (jay and silent bob) look for silent bob dance. not much more i can say but what a great movie. i hope everyone enjoys it as much as i did and still do.
0684874350|5.0|Frank McCourt is able to touch your heart and your soul by sharing his family tragedy with us.  His family (yes, disfuntional) lived through hard times.  But they were consoled by their belief in the church and in family.  We all put too much stock in unworthy people at times, but when you are born into this life and it is either sink or swim, you learn to swim and to make do with the worst.<BR>I have a special dislike of their father as he was a small and selfish man.  But then again, it was a time when most of their country were &quot;on the dole&quot;.....how were they to know different?  At least the boys grew up and moved away from the poverty and made their lives back in America.  I adore Frank McCourt's writing and hope he continues.
B00004S6GL|4.0|This is a terrific album. Buy it! If you're reading these reviews you obviously have some interest in this kind of music!<BR>Elliot and the Like! (Matthew Jay, Travis etc..) have come out of the shadows and in their quiet way are fast becoming a refreshing force in the music world... and to a degree being left alone to do their thing.<BR>Elliot's songs take me back to early Simon &amp; Garfunkel, a little Brian Wilson, and undoubtedly Paul McCartney without a deliberate stealing! His writing reflects a similar poetic colloquialism that was very much in Paul Simon's early work! It's a welcome return!<BR>This collection of songs also show Elliot growing up without losing his root which made us all take notice in the first place!
6305426651|2.0|About a year ago I wrote a controversial review over this movie. I decided to pull it off in the end because I realized it didn't convey my opinion correctly.<br />Today I want to repeat my efforts to point out the things that were wrong in this film, because I truly think someone did here something unjustified and got away with it.I know the most see it a remarkable 'human spirit victory', not me.<br />To begin with, it's all attached to the way you allow yourself to perceive the Holocaust.<br />Most recently, I've read the opinion of an Austrian Philosopher, that his beliefs raised much ado in the European academies. He has published an article that, in short, speaks about the need to percept the actuality of the Holocaust as another tragedy among many in the 20th century. He reminds us that there were more than a few like-Shoas genocide events and that one shouldn't dramatize this in particular.<br />He resents the sacredness people are giving to the Holocaust, and claims that it harms the greater goal of healing and evolving to a better humanity as a whole.<br />Why have I mentioned this ?  Because I suspect his thoughts, in a way , are given form in this film.<br />First of all, you'd have to agree with me that the main subject of this movie is the Holocaust(and the efforts to inclose it from the child). Moreover, it's not just a comedy - it has a purpose.<br />Now we can begin our journey. Half a movie is evidently almost a pure comedy. The terror that is to come is cued, very subtly. With the other half I have my problems, because here we really enter the concentration camp, and the Holocaust.<br />Up till now, ok, the father concealed the truth from the son -and from the rest of the viewers. But once in the camp - the comedy continues, AND, a person can get the impression that this is what it really was.I would causiously say taht you might give legitimacy to Holocaust deniers by screening this film-they will find a lot to hang on to. It's wrong to put things in this light. You see the reality of the camp through the eyes of a child ,as a game, and people might think - hell, maybe that what it really was, everything else is another pulp fiction of the Jews !<br />I feel that this movie help those who are responsible, or feel responsible to polish their conscience. How? By pretending it wasn't that bad, not to say it wasn't at all. Recall this scene: after the supper with the Germans, the father takes his son to their quarters. There is mist all around, and everything is foggy - and exactly then he witnesses for the first and last time a stack of dead bodies ,apparently Jews, the only innuendo in the film for what is really going on . He fortunately succeeds in preventing his son from seeing.The wrong is the whole atmosphere which allude us this was all a dream,a Nightmare - the dead pile wasn't real!<br /><br />Look, I didn't spend watching the movie searching for things like that, but it just popped up and really bothered me - and there are more examples like that .<br />I admit, an article I'd read before I saw the movie influenced me. But aren't we all ?<br />We criticize things all the time - so why regard a `non harmful' comedy, when it is about the Shoa, as it is? I looked deeper and found disturbing messages all over the film that I feel shouldn't be ignored. That's why it was important for me to express it, even though most folks disagree.  Do not take the film as innocent as it appears! This 'comedy' had a purpose, and it wasn't just to entertain us.<br />Getting back to the Philosopher I started with, this film is the first I know ,that allows itself to look in another glasses over the ,up to this point, a somber ,terrible and serious tragedy. 'All the sudden' it is fine not to dramatize the whole concept . We can start talking now with the `take it easy' terms. It's not a major disgraceful point in the humanity evolution anymore, like it can be interpreted from the opinion of the Philosopher.<br />I hope reading this clarified your understanding of my resentment from the movie,though you may still wouldn't agree with me...clarified your understanding of my resentment from the movie,though you may still wouldn't agree with me...

B00005NI5Y|5.0|Having just received the CD + Bonus Tracks, I went right to the extra disc containing the two previously unreleased recordings. Song 1, I Was Young When I Left Home, sets the tone. It's a beautiful folk tune circa 1961 that belongs on volume 1 of &quot;The Bootleg Series&quot;. Song 2, The Times They Are A-Changin', a demo of which is on that disc, leaves you breathless. Dylan the poet. Dylan the prophet. It's all been said and written before, yet this song resonates powerfully once again. It's always been a big song. An anthem. But just now, close to 40 years after its release, in light of yesterday's horror, its verses, cliched though they may be, are eerie. You all know them. Go back and listen again. This version is lovely, but any will do. See if you don't get the chills...I've only listened to &quot;Love and Theft&quot; once and it hasn't really sunk in yet. I'm sure, after repeated listens, it will grow on me. After traveling through time and memory with the bonus disc, I'm pulling out volume one of &quot;The Bootleg Series&quot; for all that it's worth. Peace and love.
6305014140|1.0|This was one of the worst animes I have ever seen to date.  If you're very religious, and consider something that takes things from Christianity and makes them into something sickening or mixed in with some other religion, then don't buy this anime series.  It was offensive to me.  The story wasn't that great either.  I would have liked it a lot better if it were more realistic than sick.  Religion shouldn't be tampered with in any way....<br />P.S. This is just what I say/my opinion.  I didn't say it was a fact.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Now, I love the Star Wars films... although this might not be as good as the *other* movies... this still is George Lucus' masterpiece! And 'heck', it's the first Star Wars film on DVD! Look at all those bonus features! It'll be a blast. I thought the movie was *good* but not great. It can be entertaining... just not as entertaining as the first 3. The special effects are totally stunning. (Just look at the pod-race scene, holy...!) It may not be as classical as the movies before it, but 'heck', it's Star Wars and I'm pretty 'darn' happy. Get this disc, it's a work of magic (the special effects that is..) the actual movie is O.K. it's not TOTALLY AWESOME, but it'll do until a new one comes out.
B00003CXD0|4.0|If ever a movie got robbed on Oscar® night, it was TOOTSIE.   Up against the historical powerhouse GANDHI, it didn't stand much of a chance.  But in any other year, it would clearly have swept the statuettes off the stage.  <br />This sublime comedy is a must for every aspiring actor, not only for the message it delivers about the need for talent to be tempered by professionalism, but also for the sheer quality of the acting on display.  There's not a single actor in the entire piece who fails the script.  The editing is particularly crisp, often adding a comic punctuation of its own.  <br />For me, the standout actor is not Dustin Hoffman but the highly underrated Sydney Pollack.  As Michael Dorsey's frustrated agent, and the only character actually in opposition to Dorsey's impersonation, his sense of frustration and confusion provides, I think, the funniest moments in the film.  What's even more impressive is that his character echoes his behind-the-scenes role.  As the film's director, his principle duty is to make sure that the film coheres into a logical narrative.  Similarly, as Dorsey's agent, he provides a lot of that necessary narration.   Though many of Pollack's lines are not only hilariously funny, they also serve to better define Dorsey and provide answers to fill in potential plot holes.  In the end, the audience is twice served by Pollack.  Not only does he direct with great comic assuredness, his character crucially makes Dorsey's madness believable.  <br />What makes this DVD disappointing is not its film.  No, the woeful lack of any special features is simply inexcusable.  There is really no reason to buy the DVD over the cheaper VHS.  It's incredible to me that such a seminal work can be so bereft of even a simple director's commentary.  Hopefully, later &quot;special editions&quot; will be a more complete addition to your DVD library.
B00005A46T|1.0|I read in numerous magazines that the new Slipknot album was going to be (as quoted by the band) &quot;the heaviest and best album you will ever hear&quot;...boy is that a lie...the fact is the album is terrible, everything almost sounds exactly the same, if you literally took out the lyrics its the same patterns over and over. &quot;Left Behind&quot; sounds like they took the same groove from &quot;wait and bleed&quot; and wrote another song. These guys got big on the way they look flat out, if they didnt look like that they wouldnt be selling this many albums. And ive recently discovered this band MUSHROOMHEAD, and i have found that they have been doing the mask thing since late 1992, and that they're original look back then was: white, orange, and blue jumpsuits and rubber masks, ex:pig mask on bass player, gas mask on drummer with spikes in it, and latex bondage masks. And if you search for old slipknot pictures you'll find they didnt look like they do now and were only a 5 piece band. I have lived in Iowa all my life and I have never even heard of Slipknot till I Saw they're self-titled cd in stores. So putting all that info together I have come to realize that Slipknot is just a &quot;metal version of the Backstreet boys&quot;. And i feel bad for the band Mushroomhead cause theyre probably really struggling to get out there but probably get a lot of crap from Slipknot fans, calling them ripoffs, etc..but anyway I do not recommend &quot;IOWA&quot; its jumbled noise and theres just too many things going on. If this is the future of music then kill me now. Don't buy this album, instead go pick up MUSHROOMHEAD &quot;XX&quot; it has a lot more to offer musically then &quot;IOWA&quot; does.
B000000P11|5.0|I originally picked this up for 2 bucks used because I thought the cover looked cool. Best 2 bucks I've ever spent.<br />I like Script of the Bridge, but this is one of my favorite albums of all time - I've just about worn this thing out. It is very well produced in that it has a consistent feel throughout - the ambient echos and repeated counterpoint against changing harmonics give it at the same time an open yet warm &amp; earthy feel. The covers are some of the best I've heard, keeping the feel of the original songs while making them sound as if they should have been written for the Chameleons all along. <br />I don't understand the pretentious label that some other reviews have given this disc. Morissey is pretentious. REM got pretentious. This is just wonderful. <br />I can get lost in this CD.

B00005J9M1|5.0|I'm a huge Pet Shop Boys fan. &quot;Very&quot; is my favorite album of their's. While the early to mid-'90s were drowning in grunge music, PSB puts out a brilliant yet underrated synth-pop album that will remain a personal favorite among loyal listeners. Neil and Chris' cover of the Village People's &quot;Go West&quot; is far superior version. I own the original orange case for &quot;Very&quot; which I cannot bear to part with but when I found out about the reissues w/remixes and outtakes I had to buy the newly reissued &quot;Very&quot;. I must say that the reissue cd is awesome. I love the the previously unreleased 12 inch remix of &quot;Go West&quot;. I've heard other remixes of the song but this remix is so much better. I am so glad that I now have the duo's tribute to the same titled comedy show &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; on cd. I always did like that song but it was only available on cd as an import. Overall excellent album with even more excellent remixes and outtakes. Definitely well worth the money.
0060245867|5.0|.....you will have hours of fun ahead of you.<BR>My favorite time of the day is when I take my kids to bed and read for them. We read different kinds of books, but each child always gets some special favorites. If you give a Mouse a Cookie is among 5 year old Marta's all time favorites. We can read the book over and over again, and the story is just as cute as when we first discovered it.<BR>The story starts with a little boy eating cookies outside his house, he sees a mouse and wants to share his cookies with it. The mouse eats the cookie, then asks for a glass of milk, of course the boy gives him some milk, and the story goes on and on. The little mouse asking for more and more, the boy having a wonderful time following his new companion. From a napkin, to scissors to trim his hair, a broom to sweep up, and so on. And the wonderful, funny last page when the mouse asks for a glass of milk, but of course, if you give him a glass of milk the chances are that he will want a cookie to go with it, and we are right back to the start of the book. The most perfect story for a child who always wants repetitions, over and over again. <BR>The book is beautifully written by Laure Joffe Numeroff, and the cute drawings to illustrate the story are made by Felicia Bond.<BR>Lucky parents and children with books like this to share.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland
014028009X|5.0|I usually read all the books my female friends recommend (well, at least I start reading them; as some are a just too singlemindedly feministic to enjoy). The 2 Bridget Jones Diaries I've read so far produced many floods of laughing tears. Her self irony and the funny-honest way she writes down her thoughts as well as whats happening to her are outstanding. She even managed, that my wife and myself keep using the &quot;gaaah, gaaah, gaaah's&quot;, whenever something remotedly similar happens to us ... and just can't help laughing every time 'cause our minds fly back to Bridget ....   :-)
B00003CXWV|5.0|With all the accolades of 2000 going to &quot;Traffic&quot;, I was left with the usual disdain for an ignorant industry, public, and media.  Then along came &quot;Blow.&quot;  Despite the absence of the same slick production and large celebrity cameos (unless you consider Bobcat a major celeb), this film is incredibly versimilar to the real characters and settings upon which it is based.  The film's basis is a major reason to praise it, it is not a moralistic attempt at presenting a pro/con, two-hour-exclusive on the world of drugs, it is the story of a real anti-hero.  Of course it does not hurt that George Jung is portrayed by the finest actor of our time, Johnny Depp.  But Depp is not the only one doing a stellar job, Ray Liotta and Paul Ruebens also turn out noteworthy performances and Penelope Cruz demonstrates much more talent here than in any of her other films.  Top to bottom, &quot;Blow&quot; is well done and well performed, but the basis in the real story of George Jung is what distinguishes it from other movies made about illicit substance in the United States.  A study of the real story presents an almost identical account to those shown in the film (check out the DVD for an even more in-depth depiction in the deleted scenes and a peek at the real story from the real George Jung) and this is critical in entertaining and provoking thought in anyone with the most elementary understanding of drugs in the United States.  This film should and does stand on its own merits, but it is almost unavoidable to compare to &quot;Traffic&quot;, the Substance Abuse 101 as compared to this film marvel, which is more like a graduate course.  &quot;Blow&quot; is worth a look as both a story and a commentary, perhaps even to those who are not interested in the subject that deals with one of the most important legal, social, economic, and international dilemnas that we face today.
0380796090|5.0|At first I had some problems with the style the book is written in, but very soon I was too deep into the story to let it interfere with the fun of reading it.<BR>It's really one of the better books, that give those of us men, who are interested in the way a female psyche &amp; their thoughts (&amp; their resulting actions) work, interesting insights.<BR>A really entertaining book about something, that can happen to every one of us; seen thru the eyes of an emotionally intelligent woman that doesn't let herself go.<BR>Marian Keys can keep up her funny kind of storytelling over the whole book, the basic topic being everything else than funny. Really fascinating ! I will read her other novels, too !
B00003CXN4|3.0|Traffic is most commendable for its cinematographic and actorial ability to create the hot, arrid, and hopeless feel of Mexico, the calm but uneasy nature suburbia (possibly the worst job it does), the striking and multi-faceted world of the upper class addict, and the torn morality of a drug cop.  Most notable is the performance of Benecio Del Toro, who continues to emerge as one of the most dynamic actors in the business.  But beyond it's solid fundamentals, Traffic is a bit too ambitious and simplistic.  In a rush to assert a pro/con format, the film forces its points, most egregiously when Topher Grace's Seth bursts out about the reasoning behind drugs in the &quot;ghetto,&quot; an important point that was merely brushed over by his speech.  Grace does well in his first role in a major film and there are really no complaints to be made about the acting, but each character is so audaciously allegorical that the story becomes a tough pill to swallow.  Moreover, with two hours of screen time to force ideas into the viewer's mind, Traffic is without a new idea (except for the dolls made of cocaine perhaps).  The &quot;social relevance&quot; of this film is capitulated and expanded upon in a single page in Charles F Levinthal's texts and the story is otherwise without any great appeal.  If you are curious about the world of drugs and truly a novice on the subject, then this is a fine introduction, otherwise you will be able to stay awake and commend the film for its production, not much else.
B00004YKUX|5.0|I have been absolutely floored by this album. As Johnny is getting old and suffering from a degenerative illness, it's unknown if there will be any other new recordings by this amazing man. In the liner notes, he even states that he started it intending it to be his last.<BR>As a result of this, his voice sounds different than before - more tender, and even a bit fragile. But still, his voice and style is unmistakably Johnny Cash, as he does a number of original pieces as well as takes on works by U2 (One), Tom Petty, and Neil Diamond. <br />One immediate standout to me is &quot;Field of Diamonds&quot;, with backing vocals by June Carter Cash and Sheryl Crow and a some beautiful piano chords lying in the streams of guitar. Without shame, I'll admit tears in my eyes. Then again - harmonies (especially ones like this) always have a powerful effect on me.<br />There is also the great death row track &quot;The mercy seat&quot;, penned by Nick Cave.  Johnny sings/speaks the first person story of a convict on his way to and in the electric chair.  The song starts with just guitar and Johnny's voice, but continues to build with organs and pianos while leaving behind the melodrama of the Cave's original.<br />There are many other great songs on this album - &quot;I'm Leaving Now&quot; features Merle Haggard and Johnny singing together &quot;get out of my space, get out of my face, I'm leaving now&quot;; &quot;Country Trash&quot; and &quot;Before my time&quot; are perspectives on older days; &quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot; is another great gospel adaptation from the man in black and closes out the album &quot;I'm going there to see my mother, she said she'll meet me when I come. So I'm just going over Jordan, I'm just going over home.&quot;<br />You can't go wrong with this album. This is music as it's supposed to be - celebratory, melencholy, full of stories, with simple but (as always) powerful instrumentation. It's a great mix of songwriting, with almost equal parts Cash originals and adaptations of others works. It stands well with (and a bit beyond) the other new Cash releases of the 90's ('American Recordings' and 'Unchained').
B00005NOZ6|5.0|Depending on how you look at it, this album will never be judged on its musical merits alone.  The performances are amazing, in particular Jordan Rudess' keyboard playing, which has revitalized Dream Theater in ways we as fans still haven't fully realized.  However, this will always be overshadowed by the artwork.  The extremely unfortunate circumstance of releasing this album on the same day as the greatest terrorist attack ever committed on American soil in the same city where this CD was recorded is perhaps one of the greatest coincidences ever.  Will this overshadow the musical contents?  It remains to be seen.  However, I'm sure Dream Theater fans will always remember September 11, 2001 with an extreme sense of irony.  Dream Theater's performance on this record is inspired and intense.  The instrumentalists are all super tight, unleashing unparallelled virtuoso performances on a willing and receptive audience.  The songs are translated perfectly and profoundly on the live stage.  Dream Theater obviously gave the New Yorkers as well as the other fans in attendance a night they will never forget, and released this for the public on a day none of us will ever forget.  The spirit carries on.
B000002JSV|5.0|It is very puzzling why this absolutely great record of ... rock and roll doesn't get more recognition.  This is AC/DC at their best and they never would surpass it.  Powerage shows a confident, brash, and ballsy bunch of guys from \\"Down Under\\" playing fantastic, stripped down, honest, dangerous, but good time Rock n' Roll.  Loaded with great melodies, lots of sweeping hooks, double entendres, wonderful guitar licks, and Bon Scott at his sneering, cynical, yet good natured best.  Even as you get older you'll find yourself turning the volume knob all the way to right when you throw this classic on.  On Powerage the boys had finally worked out all the kinks and were still playing with a unquenchable passion and sense of abandon that they soon would lose a great deal of when they hit the big time with their next, less impressive work, Highway to Hell.  There is not one bad cut on this solid and high-wired collection of no-nonsense, good time, \\"yeah we aren't PC who cares for we sure don't,\\" recording.  From the incredible opening power chord laced anthem, Rock & Roll Damnation, the listener is hooked and they refuse to let your mind wander at all until it's over.  Down Payment Blues is a seminal cut featuring a bluesy, fuzzed up, ode to having nothing and liking it, and it may be the most overlooked AC/DC song in their entire catalog.  You can't help but smile when Bon belts out \\"I know I ain't doing much, but doing nothin' means a lot to me.\\"  Next up is the in your face, foot stompin' number Gimme a Bullet, where the Brothers' Young and Bon just crank it out.  The last song on this side of the record is their ultra-high energy masterpiece Riff Raff.  The opening \\"riff\\" on this 100 cup of cappuccino track implants itself so firmly in your brain that you couldn't shut it out with a sledgehammer, while Bon Scott sings like a man possessed,<BR>only it's not by evil, but rather the power of almighty, wicked, hard rockin' music, that feeds his frenzy.  Side two of this record doesn't let the listener rest, for their classic piece of snarling, sleaze, Sin City is the opening track.  I couldn't have spent my one year of living purgatory in Vegas without playing this monster at least once a day.  What's Next to the Moon is another of the all time lost AC/DC classics and it holds its own against the classic opening cut on side 2.  Gone Shootin' is the next cut on this, never say die, work, and this song is where all Bon Scott fans will wonder why they even listen to any AC/DC albums with that other guy?  He smacks this brooding, menacing, methodical, cruncher right out of the park.  No time to rest 'cause they are cranking out the next tune, Up to My Neck in You, with a pounding yet very up beat piece of Garage Band with an attitude straight forward rocker.  The last song on the record is only for any guy ever has had his heart stomped on by some soulless, vixen, and somehow still misses that broad anyway.  Yeah, you'll be playing this cut all the time for anytime you're girlfriend, wife, etc., gets on your back you must play this as a cathartic release.  You know it's something special when Bon spews out acappella, \\"Two faced woman with your two faced lies,\\" followed by the Young brothers slamming the same chord four times in a row like it's Thor's hammer, and some critics think this is the records disposable tune?  Brother's it is perhaps the most essential track on the record.  The remixed version on CD is noticeably cleaner, but the muddier and murkier original version is just as good.  This is one of the few albums that kept you from going into a ... which was brought on from all those saccharine middle of the road, ... rock albums of the seventies.  Powerage is meat and potatoes.  They never played better and they never had as much fun playing it either, and it shows.  Somehow, it remains a lost classic.  Get off your duff and find it!  Nobody did it better, not even themselves after they released this tour de force.  Rock on!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|&quot;Memento&quot; should teach Hollywood a lesson or two in the area of smart filmmaking. I don't know that I've seen a more engrossing film over the last 2 or 3 years. Its combination of exciting, yet simplistic, storytelling and a marvelous soundtrack really make this film stand out head and shoulders above anything that's been released this year. I really get excited when a director uses the right music to convey the right emotions - it sets the right tone for a film that may get some attention at Oscar time next year.
B000053V7Q|5.0|Sit back and enjoy the finest ever testament to the King! Picture and sound on this DVD are as perfect as we are ever likely to get from 1970. Yes, we are deprived of several wonderful performances from the original movie (most notably &quot;I just can't help believin'&quot;), but this special edition focuses on showing Elvis the man as well as the most dynamic performer of the 20th century. Enjoy the rapport of Elvis and his band rehearsing, the thrill of his fans when he jumps into the audience, then watch the cat move in &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;! The charisma shines through like a searchlight. This movie should have been the greatest Elvis movie when it was first released. Now - IT IS!

B00000255F|4.0|Bruce Springsteen may not have created heartland rock with this album, but he certainly defined it. The classic track from the album is of course &quot;Born to Run.&quot; When I first heard it on this CD after only hearing it infrequently on the radio over the last several years, I was struck with the realisation of how great a song it is, and also just how relevant it remains today. That's the highlight, but the rest of the CD - from &quot;Thunder Road&quot; to &quot;Jungleland&quot; - is excellent as well. The primary motif throughout the CD is a bitter pain and longing. The most pathos-ridden track on the CD is &quot;Meeting Across the River,&quot; which is simultaneously bleakly stark and filled with a dark pathos. The rest of the tracks aren't so bleak, but they all do capture an aura of trapped hopelessness.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|I'm not a big fan of horror movies. Especially if they conatain a plot about zombies. But after renting a copy of &quot;Army of Darkness&quot;, the third in the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; series, I decided to go out and find a copy and see where the terror started. While not big on effects, this movie does what it can on its budget and is still standing after its initial late 1970s release. While its definetly not for the weaked stomached, it is a great film in its own right, and deserves to be in any film collector's collection.
0767817486|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've seen ever. This is a story about a man, nammed Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) who tries to smuggle hessise(turkish drug) across the boader to America. But there is one small problem he gets caught. He is sentecenced to serve four years in a turkish prison. Billy leaves a worried girlfriend, father, mother, brother, and sister behind. In the prison he meets durgies and a whole new kind of people he never thought would exsist. The guards beat and tourcher not only him but everybody in that prison and other prisons in that part of the world were just the same. In Turkey who don't have the right to free speech like in America so when he went to court he had a hard time trying to defend himself. Billy is then sentenced to 30 years in the prison which I might add does not really qualify as a prison at all in my opinon. Billy and Rand quaid and one other person try to escape for every day for a whole week but then they are caught by a inmatte who gives randy qaid away. Randy is beaten so bad that he is in a hospital for months with a hernia. Billy gets so mad he kills ruski the immate who gives them away and basically goes insane witth rage and then immeditly after he is sent to a turkish mental institution with pyscos. His girlfriend talks to him and he has a new light os getting out. He bribes then kills a guard puts on his uniform and leaves. Three months later he crosses the boarder into Greece and gets on a plane and goes back to America to reunite with his family. <br />This is emmotional true story. I dont like this movie for many reasons one is almost have the movie is spoken in the turkish natoinal language. This has too many graphic seens that I don't care for and many people won't like. I was frequntly looking at how much time was left in the movie and you should never be doing that when your wacthing a movie. I don't like this for another reason becausethe story is horribal even though it is true. I just don't like to see Americans being beaten in a turkish prison. Maybe you would like to rent this movie and see what I'm talking about but this is definitly not a movie to buy.
B00005N5S5|4.0|The transfer of this film is beautiful. I can finally toss my VHS copy. The features are the reason we're purchasing this one. There are 2 well made documentaries but the first thing you will want to check out are the delted scenes. This is what makes the dvd worth it. There are only 6 segments. Each feature commentary from James Cameron. You only wish he did commentary on the film. The scenes are too short to get in real insight into the film from the commentaries. The final deleted scene is really an alternative ending. This edition is 1 dvd but there are materials on both sides. Cool, now-standard animated menus.
0131103628|5.0|It is difficult to avoid cliches when talking about this book - it is just so good, that one can't help heaping superlatives on it.<br />This book is affectionately known as 'K &amp; R', after the names of the authors, and it is almost definitely the most widely respected of all books on any given programming language.<br />This is the book that introduced the 'Hello World!' program to the world :-), which is now practically a standard first program in any introductory book on any programming language.<br />This is straight from the creators, and the implied authority, while an excellent reason in itself for taking a look at the book, pales in comparison to its other merits - brevity &amp; clarity being foremost.<br /><br />This book is best appreciated if you already have some programming background - i say this from experience, since i knew Fortran 77 &amp; Pascal before i learnt C, and the knowledge of Pascal, in particular,made it much easier for me to pick up C than classmates for whom it was the first programming language.<br />Of course, if you're new to programming, you could still try learning from this, but it might be a bit of a struggle. If so, the books by Kelley &amp; Pohl, K.N.King or Gottfried(Schaum series) may be useful for 'getting upto speed' with C first, and then coming to K &amp; R.<br />C is the one language which is both 'high level' and 'low level' at the same time - to date, it is the nearest to the ideal of a programming language that is easy enough in description to be followed by human readers, and at the same time close enough to the machine's language to be executed fast.There are faster languages, to be sure - assembly language is necessarily faster than any high level language. But just try coding a reasonably involved program in assembly, or even reading such an effort ! There are other languages which might be 'easier' for people to read, but they are slower(C++,Java,etc,etc).<br />It is also the 'mother' of all modern biggies - C++ owes even its very name to C, Java was derived from C++, and Perl is **written** in C !!<br />So knowing C would give you a better appreciation of the other languages as well.<br /><br />And it's still the language of choice for systems programming - so no systems programmer can afford to be a non-expert at C.<br />Anyway, back to the book - and what a book it is!

The authors choose their words judiciously, and there is not a word out of place.The book is designed to make you think, for there is no better way of learning than to think things out for yourself.<br />Reading the carefully worded text and working out the compact examples will teach you a lot - if you can go through all the exercises, well then you'll surely be an expert when you finish the book.

I am a disciple of Wing Chun under Sifu Sam Chan (but not his best student) and found this book very informative giving a look into the life of the man who is considered by many the Father of Wing Chun.  I strongly recommend this book if you enjoy the history behind Wing Chun as I do.
0790736233|1.0|Silly, self-important nonsense masquerading as deep profound Science Fiction.  Jodie Foster plays an utterly humorless and emotionally icebound BUT totally brilliant young woman (a type of role she is becoming tiresomely expert at) who is supposed to be carrying a torch for the appallingly inept Matthew McConaughey.  The lack of chemistry between them makes a significant part of the story rather hard to swallow.  Namely, one can't believe that Foster's walking iceberg has any interest at all in the McConaughey's inane all-purpose guru.<br />This movie is to serious science fiction what a Hallmark card is to Shakespeare.  Slight, admittedly rather efficient, but ultimately forgettable.
B00003CX5P|5.0|The familiar Fox Fanfare, followed by the eternally remembered line &quot;A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...&quot; BLAM! STAR WARS!!! Thus begins one of the greatest epics in years, &quot;Star Wars: Episode I--The Phantom Menace&quot;. It takes everything that we love about Star Wars movies (Jedi Knights, Royal Heroines, Cute Sidekicks, Gigantic Space Battles, Stunning Special Effects, and Awesome Lightsaber Action)and brings it into a new era. <br />The story itself is simple, a pawn/set-up for the rest of the series. On the surface it feels like an ordinary space adventure. But all Star Wars fans can sense the tragedy and doom that lurk within the unfolding events and within our hero, Anakin Skywalker (the phantom menace?). It begins with a blockade of the planet of Naboo by the corrupt Trade Federation, and the fight to free the planet by Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi and the beautiful young Queen Amidala. Also involved are a slave boy named Anakin Skywalker (destined to become the evil Darth Vader), the goofy Gungan creature Jar Jar Binks who aids the Jedi(and causes them a few headaches along the way), the two bickering droids R2-D2 and C-3P0, and an appearance by wise Jedi Master Yoda. On the other end is the sinister Senator Palpatine, who secretly manipulates the government and the Trade Federation under the guise of the shadowy Sith Lord Darth Sidious. By the end of the saga he will have become the evil Emperor, controlling everything in the galaxy. Also serving the dark side is his apprentice, the satanic figure of Darth Maul, a terrifying and formidable nemesis for the Jedi.<br />Writer/director George Lucas takes this basic story and hides within it the seeds of the adventures to come, making it more than it seems. The actors are credible, the special effects are stunning, and the music by series composer John Williams is excellent. Even his score hints at the darkness to come.<br />The blazing action steals most of the film. From the opening Jedi fight on the Battleship to the fast-speed Podrace, we are treated to some of the most amazing cinematic action ever. To top it all off, the raging final battle that explodes on Naboo is super-exciting. But the best action set-piece is the breath-taking three-way lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and the evil Darth Maul. It is the greatest fight scene yet to be captured on film.<br />So don't dismiss this film because of its standard plot--it's merely setting up the rest of the saga. And don't dismiss it because of the cute and cuddly stuff--this is going to be the most lighthearted Star Wars film, a contrast to the darkness of Episodes 2 and 3. Don't judge it so harshly, because nothing could ever live up to the 16-year hype of Star Wars fanatics. All in all, this is an excellent sci-fi fantasy adventure that takes us back to that magical galaxy far, far away for a slam-bang adventure story. And the adventure is just beginning!!

079070546X|4.0|The best Christmas vacation ever! Christmas just wouldn't be the same without Chevy Chase and all the gang for this laugh-out-loud slapstick riot. When the Griswolds (kids played by different people) decide to spend their Christmas vacation at home - they not only deck the halls, but themselves as well.<BR>Co-starring in this comic masterpiece are Beverly DeAngelo and Randy Quaid. The best Chase movie since Fletch.
B000056IKS|5.0|Now, perhaps, Neu will get the recognition they deserved for so long.  The legitimate reissue of these absolutely essential albums on CD will surprise many listeners, because they prove without question that Rother and Dinger virtually invented much of what passes for &quot;new wave,&quot; punk, and ambient/new age.<br />Regardless of this, what is the Neu! sound?  On this, their first album, it's largely the manically driven, pulsing drumming of Klaus Dinger that anchors everything, while Michael Rother plays guitars and synths.  But this is only the primary element of their sound; over the top of this Rother and Dinger overlaid numerous instruments and noises, aided not a little by producer Conny Plank.<br />It is a bit dismissive of Dinger to state that he &quot;only&quot; played drums; he played a number of instruments, including what he claims is an electric banjo on the bizarre, Sonic-Youth like track, &quot;Negativland.&quot;  Rother, for his part, is often simplistically dismissed as the &quot;softer&quot; member of the group, but in several places on this first disc he demonstrates a very aggressive guitar style and a willingness to play with sound and noise that belies that claim.<br />The music is not dated at all and is still mostly without parallel, even in today's music scene.  The driving rhythms overlaid with sound effects, guitar and bass, create an atmosphere where every song is as much experienced as listened to.  From the opening thrust of &quot;Hallogallo&quot; to the final creepy whispers of &quot;Lieber Honig,&quot; this is a CD that every serious rock fan needs to listen to.  And listen to repeatedly; it reveals more on subsequent listens.<br />There are a lot of albums that are called &quot;classic,&quot; and there is a lot of hype flowing these days about so-called &quot;Krautrock,&quot; but Neu!, like their contemporaries Faust and Can, live up to their legend.  Definitive, worthwhile, and necessary.
6305014140|1.0|This DVD was highly recommended to me.  Now, the animation isn't half bad.  The fights are smart, and have incredible martial arts.  But the problem is, this is a rated X movie with enough junk to ruin it.  The gore isn't nearing realistic, but is rather WAY overboard.  Expect buckets of blood, including gruesome scenes of a monster drinking blood from a bleeding man.  Expect language, lots of it.  Expect nudity, and not just a little, but even a couple rape scenes along with the nude and sex scenes.  And sorry, but the story is rather shallow, and the voice acting really leaves something to be desired.  This is a standard action flick, with interesting ideas, but that can't come close to saving it from all the ...it has.
0812550757|4.0|&quot;Speaker for the Dead,&quot; the most anticpated second book from Orson Scott Card that follows the Great Ender Wiggin series. I went into the &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; looking for starship travel, intergalatic war, and aliens and all I got was a grown up and more serene &quot;Andrew&quot; Wiggin. Don't get me wrong, this book has great writing and a good storyline, but I got the totally wrong picture from just reading the back.<br />&quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; follows the discovery of a new race of aliens in another world about a million years from the killing of all of the Buggers. The first book revolves around Ender Wiggin being a child commander and totally killing off all of the race of alien Buggers and soon finds out everyone misunderstood the Buggers. Now, a million years later, Ender is still alive, due to light speed travel and is in for a whole new challenge. After the colony of Luistania suffers the brutal killing of one of their Xenologers by the alien race deemed the piggies, everyone is in a state of terror. It is up to our friend Ender to travel there and sort out the mess that has erupted before the humans kill all of the piggies in ignorance.<br />The book was a very well written peice of literature, but you know what they say about the sequel not being as good as the first, well it applies here. Orson Scott Card has great imaginative abilities and wonderful setting are displayed, but if you want to look for his better works, look elsewhere. I suggest this book to all science fiction buffs out there, but if not, you will not like it.  The characters are strong and symbolic and the plot is alright, but is just doesn't have what it takes. I was originally going to give it 3 stars, but the imagination that went into a work like this was incredible, so I'll give it 4 stars.
0767825411|3.0|3 stars doesn't apply to the movie, which is a 5-star rating<BR>any day of the week, but to the poor translation of this movie<BR>to video.<br />While the digital remaster greatly improves the quality of the<BR>film, the panning is totally obvious and wholly unacceptable.<BR>There is some bad panning in GB2, but not as much as here and it<BR>really is very distracting.

B00004R99T|5.0|This is a top notch production. The songs are sweet and the story is wonderful. It is an exciting way for children to learn a little history, even though it is not entirely accurate. It reflects the rigid cultural bias Pocahontas had to overcome. It is a good account of two different cultures meeting. Some comments: &quot;Great.&quot;  &quot;Awesome.&quot; &quot;It was a good story because Pocahontas was a good person.&quot; &quot;The Indians have brown skin like me.&quot; &quot;It was funny.&quot; &quot;I learned a little about Pocahontas; now I need to read and see what really happened and if the movie goes along with it.&quot;  Best for ages 5 to 8.

0800187792|5.0|Charming, wholesome movie with powerful acting by likable characters. Without being overly sentimental, shows how parent and child can reconcile differences. Inspiring insights into flight, migration, death and self-strength. Ages 12-18.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|This new album is not as good as &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;, but Bob shows no sign of sliding backwards as &quot;Love and Theft&quot; is a collection of fresh, insightful songs with a powerful sound and humorous, if not autobiographical lyrics. The whole album flows perfectly between ruckus, rockabilly style blues, folk, with a touch of jazz. The two faves for me are &quot;Mississippi&quot; and &quot;Highwater&quot;. I was surprised at the twist in direction Bob took with this latest album. &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; was an album about lost chances and fading away. The new album takes a lighter yet crucial look inside the man, who still refuses to give up on himself and the world around him.<BR>Randall
B00000G09Q|3.0|Well the turtles have grown up a bit more and have matured a lot.  After defeating the Shredder and the foot they now find themselves practicing ninjitsu all day everyday.  That will all come into play when they find themselves in ancient feudal japan coming face-to-face with a Samurai war lord and a war happy pirate named Walker.  The turtles mission isn't simple.  Travel back in time, save April and get back home before &quot;time&quot; is up.  Things just don't go as planned and throughout the movie they bump heads with samurai warriors.  The turtles had no intention of fighting but when it came time they moved like ninja turtles do.  I love the fight scenes in this movie.  It was quick and simple.  Though at the same time the turtles moved with speed and grace.  It wasn't that the samurai couldn't fight it was just that the turtles fought better.  They got their weapons back in this movie and used them accordingly.  Every move they made was unbeleivable.  It was nothing like the first two movies.  Plus instead of laying down like the foot soldiers, these samurai persisted in fighting just like real samurai.  The scenery was beautiful throughout the whole movie.  I think that the Splinter puppeteering could have been much better than it was and they could have added more to the ending than what they did.  All in all the turtles are back and it's major league but kicking time.  All turtle fans will enjoy this one.  2002 CGI will animate them under the direction of John Woo.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|What a treasure! Another brilliant album by America's greatest artist. You have to go way back to find an artist more influential than Dylan. C'mon folks, this is his 43rd album and it's astonishing! It really shares no qualities with the previous &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; other than it is Dylan making more wonderful, timeless music. Gone is the Daniel Lanois production that added a lot to &quot;Time.&quot; This new batch of songs is probably more classic sounding. One thing I notice is that this band really cooks. They are so tight sounding. I guess that's what comes from endless touring. The upbeat tunes like &quot;Honest With Me&quot; sound really fresh to my ears. &quot;Mississippi&quot; will be touted as an instant classic. Many fans may know it is a &quot;Time&quot; song that did not make the album and was re-recorded for this album. Bob Dylan is so cool! I love what a People magazine writer said in a review: &quot;May this be the halfway point.&quot;
B00005KFUM|4.0|This CD has one of the best opening tracks of all time (except maybe Smells Like Teen Spirit and Round Here) - it starts of with piano, then the bass kicks in, then a verse is sung, then it fades out - to be replaced with incredible guitar. That pretty much sets the scene for the album - some quite, classical bits but mostly rocky. Stand out songs include Plug in Baby (of course), Citizen Erased, which is very rocky and the cover of Feeling Good. It does end with a fairly terrible song, but the rest of the album is incredible.
B00005NI5Y|3.0|After Dylan's last release from the Wonder Boys sound track, I had great hopes for this record, and Dylan's transformation into some sort of country vaudeville circus clown has some interesting moments. The experiments with swing and rockabilly are a couple. However after repeated listening they just don't really grab you. The first track Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum is a rocker and a promising start. His new voice is perfect for it, and the humor within the writing on this track and some others is reminiscent of his attitude on TOOM, but the rest is just not to up to that level.<br />Considering what's out there right now this is not a bad album, but for a Dylan album from any of his phases it's just not up to standard. Keep the next track forward button under your finger, or better still grab a copy of Good As I've Been To You, an underrated Dylan classic.
0553269631|4.0|This is a book about a deaf mute who moves to a boarding house in the south and changes the lives of people around him.  Ms. McCullers was a communist during the time she wrote this book and you can really see the influence of her ideology throughout the book.  <br />The story is very sad, with a sad ending, but dont let that stop you from reading this great book.  All the characters come alive and I feel the reader can relate to each ones lives.  The saddest part is that no one could hear the deaf mute (Mr. Singer) in his lonliness, and in essence I feel he was being unwittingly used by the town people.  <br />If you have seen the movie, dont let that stop you, the book is ENTIRELY different from the movie, at least what I saw of it.
B00003CY0U|5.0|This film is amazing. Ignore everything the critics have said - I can only assume that they [dont] understand the plot and follow it's twists. Yes there is a plot - and a very clever one, with some great ideas and twists. The techniques used in filming this are very clever too, and as others have said it is very real - the charachters all make believable, realistic decisions and act believably. There isn't loads of action in the film, though what there is is excellent, but it will make you think very hard about some things ...
B000055Y0X|5.0|this movie is really really good.<br />this movie shows the paranoia of the late 40's and 50's and the rest of the coldwar era for that matter perfectly!<br />the charater dr strangelove is hilarious as well! i loved this movie so much. i bought this video years ago, back when i didn't buy many videos, so you know it has to be good if i bought it back then :-)
B00004Z459|5.0|The most important thing I can say about this is they are not like Limp Bizkit or Papa Roach or anyone else like that. One Step Closer is the only song remotely like anything they have produced. They are an intelligent band, with a singer who can really sing. I think the whole band takes part in vocals, singing, rapping, whispering or shouting as their talent dictates. The guitar is great, too, especially on A Place For My Head and the electronic stuff not overused, but enhancing the overall effect. The best song is In The End, with amazing vocals and a great chorus, but there is not one song on this CD I don't like.
B00003CXP1|5.0|i can and have watched this movie over and over again.<br />i believe that EVERY teenager should be forced to watch this movie. i originally rented and then bought this video on the advice of a friend. <br />this is an extremely derpressing film of addiction. addiction is something everyone deals with and doesn't even realise it. whether it be the tv, or drugs, and thats what makes this film so scarey.<br />point two to buy this film, its done by darren aronofsky, he's a great director and has done &quot;pi&quot; a couple years back.<br />the combination of him and a powerful story makes this film brilliant.<br />this film should have gotten awards for best female actress, best film, and best editing for 2001. . .this movie was severly robbed.

0782008372|2.0|The director should put together a special edition style repolishing of this movie and gutting out Queen's spacey, cartoonish, synth laden, cheapy '80s soundtrack and instead put in a wide variety modern artists like Marilyn Manson, Destiny's Child, Little Bow Wow, Nine Inch Nails, Rob Zombie, Beck, Metallica, Cannibal Corpse, System of a Down, Paula Cole to name just a few. This is a teenage movie, so I suppose it made sense that they chose Queen instead of Brian Wilson or someone more adult oriented and ill-suited for a fantasy-swords and sorcery/sci-fi youth oriented film, but their annoying Dungeons and Dragons era music may have fit perfectly with the '80s teenage crowd but it needs an new facial guided by modern artists. Back in the day I guess, gifted, multidimensional, do-it-all bands like Queen were so diverse and talented (and unusually literate during their really old '70s cheez-o-rama glam rock period)that they could actually be counted on to score the entire film, like Prince who made all the music for his own films, and handle many types of styles and emotional states, but that's the best you can say about this. When I hear the final song in the movie &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; I'm reminded of all these annoying '80s movies like Breakfast Club and Never Ending Story. Maybe Queen, because of their background, was perfectly suited to scoring a fantasy-mythology type story telling flick for young adults back then, but I think people like Marilyn Manson and Eminem are better suited to handle deep subject matter and rich, healthy, strong, youthful, passion and act as a guide for today's youth. Plus, I'd like to see some additions of alot of digitized creatures, giant lizards, furry teddy bares, squeeking mammals, cuddley aliens, cuter sound effects and various technical advancements and colorings and improvements that would give it an extra BANG and make kids want to see it again. Maybe some day they could switch the actors digitally and replace Christopher Lambert with Freddie Prinz Jr. and the female lead with Cameron Diaz's cheeky supermodel face. I mean, just use your imagination. But in the meantime, this flawed artifact, I suppose, was the genesis for a lot of superior sequals. If you want to see a great Highlander movie, rent the second one! This one needs work.
B00000DGUG|5.0|i know there's a whole lot of reviews already written for this album, but i had to put my two cents in. this has to be one of the best albums of the late 90s. i know the single that got the most attention, 'thank you' wasn't well-received, partly because it contradicted the 'angry white female' image she acquired with the previous album.  on 'supposed former infatuation junkie,' alanis deals more with guilt, confusion, and triumph than with anger.<br />standout tracks include 'joining you,' 'can't not,' and 'that i would be good,' but 'the couch,' a tribal-sounding therapy session with ms. morissette, is perhaps her finest song to date. alanis' many vocal talents are displayed nicely on this album. she doesn't have the sweetest voice, but the way she can inject franic passion into her singing makes alanis one of the most interesting singer/songwriters around today.<br />if that's not enough, on 'UR,' we have more of alanis playing the harmonica! and she plays the flute on 'that i would be good.' you gotta respect that.<br />the first time i gave this a spin, i didn't really like it. but it's one of those albums that just grows on you. if you only know alanis from 'jagged little pill,' then you don't know the real alanis. try giving this one a few listens.
6305041156|5.0|&quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; shows the horrors of 20th century war,<br />but Kurisawa's masterpiece &quot;Ran&quot; shows battles. When &quot;Ran&quot; was<br />first released, I saw it on a big screen in London. Up to SPR,<br />&quot;Ran&quot; and Sam Peckinpah's &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; were the most moving<br />films I had seen - it terms of being thrilled by what was up on<br />the screen.<br />Of course, it also helps for &quot;Ran&quot; that William Shakespeare's<br />hand is all over the story.
B00005JKES|5.0|A good start, but 20 more to go. I can't believe I'm writing a silly amazon review, but this is important. If Industry people read these things, please do something about the atrocious delay in the release of this series. For Christ's sake, everything but Scooby Doo has made it to DVD already. Good work on 1-7.
B00005L94W|5.0|The CD captures the music of Takeshi Kitano's and Joe Hisaishi's<BR>movie collaborations. Apart from those of the recent productions (Brother, Hana-Bi, Kids Return), this album includes the very first score Hisaishi wrote for Kitano (A Scene at the Sea). All tracks are enjoyable and I highly recommend this.
B000002L9B|3.0|Ok, this is not bad, but not as good as Purple Rain,<BR>Dirty Mind, Controversy and Sign O' The Times of course.<BR>It is at the same level as Around The World In A Day: it has<BR>some classics, but many fillers and it's-an-okay-song-but tracks.<BR>Highlights include Kiss, AnotherLoverHoleNYoHead, Mountains and that's all. Boys and Girls is quite poor of instruments and melody, New Position is a better song but 2 short unfortunately, a hit single should had been made from it with much attention. All in all: it's not a bad album (Prince doesn't have bad ones:) but if U want 2 get his best from his earlier years get the ones I mentioned above.
B00000JTB2|5.0|This is probably among the top five, hell, the top three greatest blues albums ever. When these two musicians came together something really extraordinary happened. And it goes without saying that the guitar playing is just unbelievable. I listen to them play together and it makes me want to give up my musical aspirations cause they do such fantastic things with such ease.<BR>The stand out track on the album is without question &quot;Blues at Sunrise.&quot; For the first two tracks they pump out long jams like &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; (a blues classic) and Stevie's most well known song &quot;Pride and Joy.&quot;<BR>Along with some Hendrix stuff this is probably the best guitar playing ever caught on tape PERIOD. The backing players KNOW how to play rhythm and they do it well. Albert Kings voice is everything you want in a blues singer; deep, a little raspy but at the same time soothing in a way.<BR>I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of blues or real rock and roll, SRV and Albert. You can't get it better than this. <BR>Yes, the songs are long, so for the people who are used to 3 minute pop numbers this will probably be a hard listen at first. But I'll bet anything it would grow on anyone.<BR>Great album.
B00000099Y|4.0|Now listen, I like this band, and this album, but I'm really getting tired of hearing people say that this band is God.  I enjoy it, make no mistake, but I'm afraid I'm just not hearing the Godliness.  &quot;The Mozart of Metal&quot;?  Come on!  How much Mozart have you actually listened to?  The drummer and bassist are both very talented (though neither of them are anywhere near the best), but Adam Jones is an atrocious guitarist.  He rarely writes any interesting riffs, and the solos aren't much better than that of Godsmack.  I really think he's holding them back.  They need to replace him with someone like James Murphy or Andy LaRoque, then you'd really have something.  Maynard has a cool voice, but there are FAR better vocalists.  The &quot;intelligent lyrics&quot; are mostly just drug-induced ramblings and Bill Hicks bits.  I'm reminded of what that guy in &quot;Almost Famous&quot; said about Jim Morrison, &quot;a drunken buffoon disguised as a poet&quot;.  Compared to the mighty Dream Theater, Tool is pretty much nothing.  They are far superior musicians, and write lyrics that actually ARE intelligent and poetic.  You need only to listen to their masterpiece &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot; to know what I'm talking about.  Tool is not a bad band, in fact they're far from it, but God they are not.
B000002OX7|5.0|Christ, c'mon, from the damn album cover to the piano chords a few seconds into Baba O'Riley, this is just a great rock album. Good old Pete Townshend really doesn't receive enough credit for his accomplishments with The Who. <BR>Every time I hear Roger Daltry scream his lungs raw at the end of Won't Get Fooled Again, I'm filled with this kind of ecstatic feeling like I can do anything. It's an album filled with great songs that really make you feel good, and it speaks of everything The Who seem to stand for. It's an original accomplishment released during a time when rock was starting to become a little bland. <BR>To wrap it up and bring it to a coherent close, I'll just say that this is a fantastic album. The emotion sounds true and the feeling you get is unbelievable. Get it!
B000021XS0|5.0|My intro to Dream Theater was &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot;, which really blew me away. I then bought up all of Dream Theater's albums, which had nearly the same effect on me. So, when this came out, I was the first to buy it. As soon as it got under way, I was awestruck. Could this be real? Did I imagine that this album was this good? Nope, it really is amazing. The story is really cool, but a bit complicated. These guys are much smarter than I am, so I still haven't figured it all out yet. But hey, that just gives me all the more reason to listen to it over and over! This is Dream Theater we're talking about here, so I don't even need to tell you that the musicianship is great. This is most evident on songs such as &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Dance of Eternity&quot;, and &quot;The Spirit Carries On&quot;, but all 78 minutes of this album are enthralling. The addition of Jordan Rudess is a most rewarding decision as well. This guy can tickle the ivories like nobody's business. I'd say he's probably one of the best pianists/keyboardists alive (second only to my sister). James LaBrie is an amazing vocalist. He actually changes his voice to represent different characters (and yes, there are other voices in there too). I've never heard anyone else do that before. His is the most amazing voice I've ever heard. I...I can't even describe this album, it's so great, and even if I could, it still wouldn't do it justice. You have to experience it for yourself. There is little (possibly nothing) that can compete with this album. I've heard Tool described as &quot;the Mozart of metal&quot;, but I think that is a FAR better description of this band here. I can't wait to hear the new album. It'll be great, but they'll likely never top this.
0743200748|5.0|When I began listening to this on tape (unabridged) I fully expected a series of war stories emphasizing the bonding which takes place under combat conditions. Instead I found a riveting description of how important it is to value the friendship of those you love. In a world when close friendships are questioned because they are consdidered old fashioned, Ambrose examines personal friendships from his own experiences, including his relationship with his father, as well as historical friendships which he researched. These included famous military men, explorers, and most meaningfully friendships he developed himself in his various lives. The description of friendship found at the end of the chapter on Lewis and Clark is one of the best I have ever read. In a helter-skelter world appreciation for friendship and the close bonds contained therein is a glaring need which we all feel. It is far more than just a series of vignettes about &quot;the guys&quot; but more importantly a fascinating look into the need to be a friend and to enjoy the friendship of those who mean the most to you.
B00005A46T|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of Slipknot, or the genre they are a part of, but I did enjoy their first album, so I figured what the heck, I'll go ahead and buy this.  I am not exaggerating when I say that this album is INCREDIBLE!!  I mean, I expected it to be good, but nothing like this.  The rapmetal sound is nearly gone, giving way to a full-on brutal assault of hardcore, death metal, and industrial.  If you are a fan of any (or better yet all) of those genres, and have never thought much of Slipknot, this album will surely change your mind.  You need to hear such explosive tracks as &quot;Heretic Anthem&quot;, &quot;People=Sh_t&quot;, and the amazing title track.  I'm not likely to come back to the debut any time soon!  But, the improvements are limited.  The lyrics are about the same, there are still no solos, and they still wear the goofy masks.  But, Corey Taylor still sounds awesome, and Joey Jordison pounds faster and harder than ever.  This a really great album, and I think a fairly wide variety of people are going to enjoy it.  I can't wait to see what these guys are going to come up with next!
0425170349|4.0|If you ever feel board and have a few hours to spare, then get and read &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;. I read this book when it first came out years ago, and reread it a few weeks ago, and the plot of this book will engulf you and make you want more. The book itself is massive, and so is the story. Granted there are a few dull moments in this book, but then again its action more than makes up for it. If you get excited over action movies or enjoy a good read then definitely pick up this book.
B00005NWM3|5.0|There are few bands that just really impress you with a new and vibrant feel to the music.<BR>NickelBack stunned me with thier debut album &quot;the state&quot; and they keep this energy and feeling in this second album<BR>I highly recomend that you get both of these great albums!
B000001FI7|5.0|I originally heard several tracks from this album on live365.com's bittersweet radio station. I was captivated by the dark, haunting vocals and the lush sound of music. The whole album has an air of sad and lonely feelings which I find hard to resist.<BR>Give it a try! I decided to and was more than satisfied with the disc. This CD is now in my personal top 10 and would recommend it highly to anyone who wants more from their music.<BR>Also check out Baxter, Gus Gus, Lamb, Dot Allison and of course, PJ Harvey.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|Fabluous stuff. Rootsy, sophistocated, and funny all at once. Remdinds me of the Basement Tapes, but looser, bluesier. A few lines fall flat, but there's not a bad song on the album.
B00005NZBN|5.0|This is on the same genius as Bob last album Time Out Of Mind. Maybe this time the Grammy's will realize Bob is the male vocalist of the year.<br />All the cuts are great. Tweedle Dee Tweedle Dum starts it off with a high beat jazzy number, which was on of my favorite cuts.<BR>The album slows down a bit with Mississippi.  Summer days picks up the pace with a fast Nashville groove, Each cut really has a different sound yet they combine to make a total album. Listen to the sound cuts on Amazon then buy the album .  Bob's voice is strong and makes the album, I saw him twice this summer in concert, the back up band on tour is the same group recording the album. This album is one every music fan will have to buy. If your sick of the junk out there on the market try this one from the master.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Lately (like, say, for the past 25 years or so) the highest compliment you can give a new Bob Dylan album is to say that it's his &quot;best since Blood on the Tracks&quot; -- but what do you do if it's actually (gasp) BETTER than &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;? Do you say it's his best since &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;? Or &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;? I guess you do. Because, folks, &quot;Love and Theft&quot; is an indiputable masterpiece that is every bit the equal of his unreal mid-sixties landmark recordings. &quot;Mississippi&quot;, &quot;Floater&quot;, &quot;Moonlight&quot; (amazing!), and (my personal favorite at the momemt) the sublime, understated &quot;Po' Boy&quot; will all leave you shaking your head in disbelief if, like me, you thought this sort of masterful, affecting songwriting was beyond our hero for at least the past quarter-century or so. It's Album of the Year, obviously, and quite possibly Album of the Millenium -- ask me again in a thousand years....
B00004RFFM|3.0|I'm a big fan of formula-plot movies, the good and the bad.  While it can be fun to watch, Deep Blue Sea falls unfortunately into the latter category.  The special effects and action, while sometimes spectacular really don't manage to save what is otherwise a dog of a film that was hyped as a kind of Jaws on steroids.  Occasional snappy one-liners don't manage to make up for otherwise poor dialog, either.  A formula plot can also be used as a framework from which to hang a moral message of some kind, but the discussion of the ethics of research toward a cure for Alzheimer's, which could have given us some pleasantly deep &quot;do the ends justify the means&quot; arguments, seems to disappear once we're waiting to see who will die next in some horrific fashion.<br />What in my mind saves Deep Blue Sea from the one or two star discard bin is the character of Preacher, played by LL Cool J.  Without his humor, I probably wouldn't have bothered to see this film more than once.
B00005LW7R|5.0|Its hard to believe that Claudio Abbado hasnt recorded a Verdi opera in almost 17 years, but then, where are the great Verdi voices these years?<BR>Here he was fortunate enough to grab the best possible cast of our time. True, both Terfel and Hampson are still rather young for their roles, and neither is a natural-born verdian, but at least both are individual artists with first class voices.<BR>Terfel makes a jolly Sir John, and he pours a lot of sound to go with the belly, its only the sense of fun of a Giuseppe Taddei that is missing.<BR>Hampson too makes a young and yuppy Ford, missing the sheer gusto that the great Rolando Panerai brought to a role he made his own.<BR>Abbado recorded this opera after a long and serious illness, but you would never know it. The Berlin Philharmonic play like gods and most of the rest of the cast is very good.<BR>Of all digital versions this stands next to the 1982 Giulini for all around excellence. In general I would still prefer Giulinis cast, and even though Bruson is a little too-serious knight, he is the genuine article as a Verdi baritone. The Karajan digital recording suffers from his unidiomatic conducting, but Taddei and Panerai make it indispensable. The Gardiner recording has a very provincial cast that is hardly memorable (except for Sara Mingardo as Quickly).
B000002G7E|5.0|If it's one thing I've noticed while listening to the Velvet Underground's first two CD's, it's that while their debut album, 'The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico', has an amazing atmosphere to it, as if the band is far away in lala land (or, more likely, acid trips) and just having a good time, the second helping of songs in 'White Light/White Heat' have an extremely dense, claustrophobic and frightening feeling to it.<br />     The opening title track has a bluesy rhythm to it, but that feeling is completely gone by the 2-minute mark; 'The Gift', with John Cale telling the story of Waldo Jeffords and his idea of a romantic surprise gone horribly awry, sounds a lot like something King Missile would have done (it wouldn't surprise me if this song was in fact the inspiration for John S. Hall). But the real gem of this album is the 17-minute chaotic masterpiece 'Sister Ray'. Starting off with a couple of simple chords, Lou Reed starts singing about 'searching for his mainline'; however, about 5 minutes into the track, the drums start going faster, the guitars get louder, and everything spirals out of control for the last 12 minutes; this song could easily be the Velvets' shining moment in their short lifespan.<br />     If you're just getting into the Velvets', I suggest you first buy VU &amp; Nico, then this... but even going in that order won't stop from surprising you at the complete insanity of this album.
B00003CXTF|5.0|This movie is the best I have ever watched. It made me laugh it made me cry (pretty much all the way threw the first time i watched). If you are looking for something for everyone to watch Pearl Harbor is that movie. The guys can watch all the special affects and the women can watch the wondrefull love story and no to mention the cute guys (Hartnett and Afflect). This movie is one movie you won't be sad [if you] bought.
B00005LMBK|4.0|Like virtually everyone who has gotten into the Gorillaz, I discovered them while watching the 'Clint Eastwood' video on MTV. It was one of the most original songs and videos I had seen in a while, so I decided to buy the album, even after hearing that the rest of the songs on it were nothing like 'Clint Eastwood'. They were dead right, but they were definitely wrong about that being a bad thing.<br />     The whole background of this cartoon band is still a little sketchy to me... Damon Albarn is 2-D, then we have a 10-year-old Japanese girl as Noodle, a rapper by the name of Del the Funky Homosapien as Russel, and the animator/cartoonist, Jamie Hewlett, as Murdoc. Yet what really strikes me is that they've actually pulled the big feat off: while listening to this music, I can only imagine the animated band playing the songs.<br />     It's hard in the music industry to keep a person entertained while listening to a CD for more than an hour (only The Wall has been able to pull this off for me, while such albums as Exile on Main St. make me want to stop it halfway through). And while, unfortunately, this album falls under the latter category, it still does have some catchy hits, such as the bizarre, appropriately titled '5/4', the melancholy 'Tomorrow Comes Today', the (mostly) instrumental 'Double Bass', the B-movie-thriller-turned-rock-out 'M1 A1', and of course, 'Clint Eastwood'. Like I said before, not every song on here is perfect, but there are definitely enough solid tracks to keep me entertained most of the way through.
B00005JKG7|4.0|A small California seaside town is about to celebrate its centennial birthday, when an eerie, unearthly fog rolls in bringing murderous ghosts from the town's past to wreak vengeance upon the present-day inhabitants. John Carpenter's follow-up to HALLOWEEN has many similarities to its predecessor: a claustrophobic sense of mounting dread, leisurely introductions to its main characters which allows us to know them before they start fighting for their lives, and, finally, a striking and memorably creepy score. THE FOG has been deemed by many to be not as good as HALLOWEEN. In my opinion, the two are completely different films and should be judged separately. HALLOWEEN was the grandaddy of modern slasher flicks, and THE FOG is a stellar example of a scary ghost story. The cast in this film is excellent, consisting of Adrienne Barbeau as a resourceful DJ and Jamie Lee Curtis as a wealthy hitchhiker who is drawn unwittingly into the terror. Tom Atkins, Janet Leigh, Hal Holbrook and Nancy Loomis (playing my favorite character, the sardonic yet caring Sandy Fadel) are also memorable. John Carpenter should make more movies like this and HALLOWEEN. It's just too bad that he seems to have forgotten his roots. His last decent film was IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS. I haven't seen GHOST OF MARS yet, but everyone tells me to save my money. I think John Carpenter has been trying too hard to make &quot;hip&quot; films recently (VAMPIRES, ESCAPE FROM L.A.) instead of trying to make good ones. He should look to his first and second-born films to remember how to tell a good scary story. He's a talented man who seems to have forgotten he has talent. What a shame....
B000000HRP|4.0|This IS possibly the best Brand X album that features Phil Collins drumming on it. The whole album front to back is packed with some incredible jams and solos. Song in which stand-out on this album are &quot;Born Ugly&quot;, &quot;Euthanasia Waltz&quot;, and &quot;Unorthodox Behaviour&quot;. If you like Jazz, Rock or if you even like to Funk you'll definitely dig every inch of this. Another album to check out is entitled &quot;Marscape&quot; which is technically the first recordings of Brand X before they recorded under that name. The album is extremely hard to get a hold of in this country. If you ever come across it on vinyl it's definitely worth picking up. For me it's the start of the Brand X trip. It was recorded under John Lancaster and Robin Lumley but includes John Goodsall, Phil Collins and Morris Pert.

0784011214|4.0|Sylvester Stallone has been underrated as an actor but when it comes to action,he makes Arnold, Bruce and Van Damme looked like teenagers on a first date. Rambo II is an example of that, perhaps is not as deep as &quot;First Blood&quot; but it's the icon on what an action movie should give us: all around good performances (like the one given by Richard Crenna), good history and good pace on the action mood. Also you will enjoy the &quot;extras&quot; this DVD has. Like the trailer, trivia games and documentary.<br />If you love action movies, you won't regret it this movie!!!
0385484518|4.0|This book was great.  It showed me who is in his 20s, realize that death is not a pretty thing.  And helped me realize what the older people has to deal with, physically and mentally.  The author sounds a little untouched with the professor and doen't seem like he is really gonna miss him.  Kind of made me angry, he was just in it for the book or profit.  [...]But then again to face what he did, that might have been he's way to deal with the situation and some how rationalize it.  Very good book either way.

Yes, they are influenced by it, as especially heard in their first CD Mate.Feed...Repeat (with a different vocalist I might add), but they are nowhere near as technical, complex, or brutal as 4/5ths of the death-metal bands out there today. ... Six Feet Under is more technical than this.

6305807086|5.0|The reason I give this movie 5 stars is because of a scene that lasts a mere 15 seconds: John Malkovich's experience when he enters his own mind. In this scene he sees everyone else as himself, and all these himselves utter only the word &quot;Malkovich&quot;.<br />This scene made me reflect quite a lot, and I think that with it, Spike Jonze has uncovered one of humanity's biggest illusions (whether he did it on purpose is another matter): that there are &quot;other people&quot; around us. For even though we *perceive* other people as &quot;you&quot;, or &quot;he&quot;, or &quot;she&quot;, or &quot;they&quot;, this is not what they *are*. What they actually are is: I. For everyone is always I. Every life is lived by I. It would be easy to deduce that since every life is lived by I, then the logical consequence is that I live every life, but...<br />Did I just write &quot;but&quot;? Small mistake. This 15-second scene opened my eyes. For 15 seconds, Jonze showed the world not as we perceive it but as it actually is; for 15 seconds, he showed The Truth, and for that I give the movie *****.

B00005NI5Y|5.0|Wow.  Frankly, that's not even a suitable word to describe Bob Dylan's new album, \\"Love and Theft.\\"  After sinking, yet again, into the depths of mediocrity before his previous, ingenius album TIME OUT OF MIND, Bob Dylan returns for his first album of the new century and millenium.  Dylan, who was the greatest artist of the 20th century, enters the 21st century with a bang - and also with all the blues, jazz, rockabilly, and more influences from the 20th.    It's amazing that a 60 year old man can put out stuff like this, especially when one looks upon the likes of Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney, although they were never a match for Dylan even in their primes.<br />The master poet puts together a tour of 20th century music and 20th century feelings and events.  This album does have much of the feel of TIME OUT OF MIND (TOOM), but yet it is also distinctively different.  \\"Mississippi,\\" the album's masterpiece, was excluded from TOOM - maybe because it didn't fit.  It fits perfectly here.  Every song has a story to tell, from the betrayal and deception of \\"Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum\\" to the flood and distorted revival of \\"High Water\\" to the hard-rocking, sometimes raging \\"Honest with Me.\\"<br />Dylan has produced back-to-back masterpieces for the first time since the late 60s.  With the song written for the film WONDERBOYS, \\"Things have Changed,\\" it appears that Dylan's output is the best it has been in years.  This is a good thing, especially in a time where less than mediocre music dominates the airwaves.  So let us hope that Dylan and new musicians that he inspires can rid the airwaves of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, N'Sync and their ilk and bring us a radio renaissance.
B00003CXFU|1.0|Much-touted, much-praised, much-starred Erin Brockovich was a movie I was keeping for a lonely night at home, when I could rent it. To my disappointment, I discovered that Julia Roberts plays an extremely arrogant and mouthy lead character. Like the snotty girls who looked gorgeous in high school, but who thought themselves a cut above the rest of the merely plain or downright ugly masses, Roberts delivers a Brockovich who is foul-mouthed, contemptous, and demanding. I thought Dirty Dancing was bad and Terms of Endearment even worse, for portraying angry, demanding, self-pitying women who are continual victims of male exploitation or indifference; this movie tops them both.<BR>     Fortunately there is the relief of the exquisite actor Albert Finney. Even his character is dominated by Roberts's Brockovich, but he at least manages to stand up for himself and explain the facts of life as a hard-working, simple-living, honest lawyer who has had to scrape and save in order to create a life for himself and his family. <BR>     The movie begins with Brockovich as the single mother of three children, a plight toward which anyone would be sympathetic, trying to secure work and keep her children safe at the same time. However, it gardually begins to dawn on the viewer that every character around Brockovich is either shallow, mean-spirited, or ugly. The babysitter is uncaring. The working world is unsympathetic. When she is injured, her lawyer (Finney) fails to secure her financial future through an injury lawsuit, even though Brockovich, in testifying as plaintiff, exhibits ubelievable rudeness, profanity, and accusatory behavior, against the advice of her counsel. Eventually, she browbeats Finney into employing her, to supposedly compensate her for his failure to win her case. On the job, she immediately alienates her co-workers, but in the movie, the subtext is not that Brockovich has been rude, which she has, but that her co-workers are stupid and ugly! There are more &quot;oh poor little girl&quot; scenarios offered in conversations that recall events prior to the setting of the plot. If the movie Patch Adams was too sweet in portraying one heart-tugging scenario after another, with the big bad world of corporate medicine as the villain, this movie is equally over-laden with attempts to portray the protagonist as a victim. What is truly amazing, however, is that all of this pathos surrounding the persona of Erin Brockovich has absolutely nothing to do with the principal story of the movie!<BR>     Eventually, Brockovich begins to emerge as the champion of the rights of the ordinary citizen against the corporate interests which have contaminated their environment and lied to them about it. That is the theme of the movie and it is a fine story. Apparently based on reality, the inspirational value of the events has wonderful potential to make a fine, &quot;All-American hero&quot; plot, and with the added value of having a female hero. While that is still the core of the movie, the surrounding events, in which Brockovich browbeats, profanes, and dominates all of the males in her proximity, while scorning the women, drown out the essentially wonderful storyline. <BR>     It is possible that the real Erin Brockovich is actually like that; perhaps Julia Roberts was only depicting the character realistically. It is also possible and plausible that the real Brockovich, precisely because of her personality (if this performance actually reflects her personality), had the tenacity and fighting spirit to take on such a Goliath as the utility company, and that a more polite and well-integrated person (e.g. Finney) might not have had the &quot;hutzpah&quot; to do it. Nevertheless, trying to make an inspirational movie, one that chould be Sunday evening family fare, is defeated by the frequent use of expletives and a generally rude and obnoxious protagonist. I would have preferred a little airbrushing of the lead character's personality, even if it meant fudging on the literal truth.
B00003003R|5.0|This CD is incredible.  I'll start by saying that Guns is one of those bands who just sound better live.  Like some of my favorite bands (Metallica,AC/DC) GNR is incredible live.  Today you rarely get a band who is better live because the sound is so polished.  With Axl's blistering lyrics and Slash and Izzy's double guitar attack you get a great CD.  This CD has all of their hits and also has songs that didn't get much airplay.  If you want a CD with all the hits and great songs by this CD.  Because lets face it, Guns N Roses were the best band to come off of LA's Sunset Strip in the 80's.
B00005KKAQ|4.0|These new releases from Bright Midnight Records are very exciting. The Doors recorded numerous concerts during their career and now, with the authority and supervision of the remaining Doors, these concerts are now being released. This particular CD is a sampler of some eight shows throughout 1969-1970. The performances rate from amazing (Touch Me from the Aquarius Theater, 1969) to unusual (Love Me Two Times w/Baby, Please Don't Go/St. James Infirmary medley from Boston, MA 1970). When these guys were on, they were an unbelievable performers. For the most part, the three remaining Doors were always on. The question was Jim. Did he want to put on a great show, or did he want to just have himself a good time. When he wanted to do a great a show, it was just that. These releases are a treasure trove of music just waiting to be enjoyed by true Doors fans. This particular CD gets 4 stars due to the fact that it is a sampler and therefore the lack of continuity detracts from the CD as you get various songs from various shows. However the full concerts recordings are impeccable. It is as if you are there from start to finish. You should seek out the new CD entitled &quot;The Doors at the Aquarius Theater, Second Performance&quot; This is the second show from their 1969 performance which was partially released in 1983 on the Alive, She Cried album. If you recall, the track, &quot;Gloria&quot; this was a rehearsal that was recorded in the venue prior to that evening's performance. Great Stuff and you should check it out. Let's Roll!
B000021YQV|5.0|Who would know an album that I was not excited for at all, and was not hyped at all would be better than the album that had everyone excited, and was incredibly hyped-Slipknot &quot;Iowa&quot;. While I really do enjoy that album this album is much more creative and I think System of a Down is the all around more talented band, and it shows in this album. Serj Tankian's vocal range is unbelievable, he is one of my favorite new singers. Some of the best songs are &quot;Prison Song&quot;, &quot;Deer Dance&quot;, &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;, &quot;Bounce&quot;, and &quot;ATWA&quot;. All songs are good though, and you can listen to this entire CD without getting bored once. The only recent album that I can think that is better than this one is Slayer &quot;God hates us all&quot; which i recommend you get also. Buy this album.
B00005NZBN|5.0|The biggest difference, for me, between this album and his last (Time), is that notwithstanding the fact that Dylan has been touring been with the band that plays on this CD for quite a while, the CD features Dylan the singer in song after song.   The CD covers a lot of territory, from blues to rockabilly, country to ragtime.  Yet the unifying feature is Dylan's voice, which at 60, is simply terrific.  The singing and words are the stars in this album, which suits me just fine.

Like when the Klown made shadow puppets the last thing he made was T-rex,acid pies,the puppet show,the Klowns going door to door killing people,when Debbie was inside of baloon and when the little Klown knocked the punks'head off.<BR>  But now it's my favorite movie to watch I have it on Media original movie release out of print,MGM release,and I have it on DVD if you get this movie you will not regret it.  When you see this movie you'll have a good laugh and you'll enjoy this movie as much as I did so I hope you consider buying this movie because it's worth while watching it when have a spare time to watch it.

Secondly I heard that there was a lot of additional footage.<BR>For those who had seen this before and were possibly confused, here is what you need to see. The twenty-four minutes are all together, one long series of scenes that make things fit better, and explain these wonderful characters more. You can now see where the real interest in Ms. Portman really came from. What was once a great movie in my eyes has reached the level of near-classic. It all makes sense now, yes...
0517122707|5.0|I could not help but read nearly 50 pages at least upon every sitting while reading this book. Absolutely amazing. So many side stories, twist and turns, that, in the end, comlpletely fall together in a most amazing way. This book is truly a representation of modern literature at its best. Set in New Orleans, this book is a story of an intelligent man lost in a world of confusion and ignorance whose mishaps seem to effet everyone in the area. So many things are involved that cause the reader to never lose interest. Absolutely amazing. I laughed out loud on several occations. This book is filled with comedy, sorrow, and best of all, great writing. You will become lost in this world of the main character Ignatius J. Reilly, and feel the way he does. I even found myself talking like him in conversations after reading. This book is all the hope needed for modern literature. Truly a book that must be read.
B00005ATQF|5.0|'Full Metal Jacket' is far and away the greatest of all Vietnam films, the only one free from cant, humbug, melodrama, hysteria, mythologising or racist self-pity. Kubrick's film is more clear-eyed than those of Coppola, Cimino, Stone et al because he is under no delusion about America - he doesn't see Vietnam as some Fall from a mythic Eden, but a logical consequence of the American way. Because Kubrick's film isn't a narrative of inevitable defeat, but the moulding of the perfect American man, one whose duality (ambiguity, humanity) is ruthlessly expunged. Joker may say he feels glad to be alive, but the enduring image, a somnambulistic army of black figures marching in a dark, burning, never-ending landscape, is one of Hell, not the ersatz inferno of your average Vietnam movie, but the banal hell of Reagan's America, joylessly, unstoppably globalising. This is a Vietnam America won.<br />A lot of people, even so-called Kubrick fans, don't like 'Jacket'. This is because Kubrick resolutely refuses to give his audience a get-out clause, sugar to sweeten the pill, some manly sentiment or lachrymose hysteria. There is no critical distance, no attempt to suggest there is a better possibility, no appeal to our better instincts. <br />One might argue that there is a kind of relief in laughter, that Nietzschean guffaw against the void. Laughter is human, to share it is to be connected with other people. But if you look at the way Kubrick sets up the comedy in 'Jacket' (and this is one of the funniest movies ever made), you will find there is little real relief. As in all his films, Kubrick uses the identificatory techniques of conventional cinema (point-of-view shots, etc.) to make us identify not with the 'good' guys, the victims, the cannon fodder, the cynics who see through the war, but the fascists in authority. <br />The funniest comic set-pieces involve the ritual humiiation of Private Pyle - if we laugh, we join in his humiliation, siding with the values of murderous authority; if we don't (and it's almost impossible not to), we are left helplessly numb. 'Jacket' is a very numbing film, brilliantly replicating the brutalisation of feeling systematically undertaken by the military system (and beyond).
B00003CX5P|5.0|It's easy to argue over whether Jar-Jar was worse than Ewoks in 'contrived cuteness' or whether his accent detracted from the value of the movie. And yes, some of the rich &quot;you're deep in the middle of a story&quot; feeling of the other movies is lost here, since this of course is the beginning. Still, the Star Wars series has had an incredible impact on most people - from references to it showing up *everywhere*, to use of its terms in standard news broadcasts, even to many young women realizing, through Leia and Amidala, that women *can* be wielding laser pistols right alongside the men.<br />I got the VHS version immediately, and there was no question in my mind that I would order this DVD as soon as humanly possible, and sit and explore its NUMEROUS special features. The commentary, storyboards, documentaries, features on design, and rest are all fascinating.<br />To me, this movie wasn't of epic, sweeping moments, although there were a few of those. Perhaps THE favorite scene of mine is when Qui-Gon and Darth Maul are face to face with the energy barrier between them. They both realize that they temporarily are &quot;stuck&quot;. Qui-Gon uses this time in the best possible way he can - he sits and recharges, storing all of his energy for the fierce battle that is about to come. Darth Maul is incapable of any thought but getting at Qui-Gon - and paces back and forth, burning his energy and impatient to get at it. This one scene symbolizes to me the huge difference between the sides of the force.<br />Yes, the graphics are incredible, but the light saber battles to me are far more impressive, the amazing choreography that outshine any previous fight scenes. The pod racing scenes ended up getting me addicted to the pod racer game for a solid month, if not more.<br />It's a movie that gets into you and has implications on the things we aspire to and the way in which we talk to each other. That's pretty impressive for a sci-fi tale. I highly recommend getting this, if only because it is a piece of our cultural history.his, if only because it is a piece of our cultural history.
6305181810|3.0|'The Rain Maker' is Coppola's most engaging film in years.  It is a curiously inert one - the plot is an extended take on a hundred episodes of 'Quincy', so there is little suspense; there is no character development, each character almost exactly the same finishing as beginning, give or take a few bruises.  Matt Damon is so stolid, he could only be a man of unimpeachable integrity, a Gregory Peck for the new millenium in the body of Rock Hudson.  There is absolutely no conflict for the audience - the bad guys are slickly, callously, cynically evil, with every sordid revelation of their business practice only confirming this: they are all caricatures, albeit enjoyable ones.  The good guys are almost angelic.  There's nothing wrong with al this - it's nice, in these exhaustingly globalising times, to assert the values of 'little people' against monstrous corporations, even if we have to get all Capra-sentimental to do it, even if we've to deny humanity and truth.<br />So why, in spite of all this, is 'Rain' so enjoyable?  Is it the cast of practised professionals doing their thing?  Partly, if you like your crime dramas spliced with 'Around the World in 80 Days'.  Is it Coppola's uncharacteristically relaxed storytelling, giving each scene space without imposing heavy meaning on it, pushing the story along at a quick pace, emphasising the comic and the playful?  Definitely.  <br />But there's more.  Despite its professional proficiency, 'Rain' is not just an anonymous Coppola director-for-hire assignment.  There are shades of 'the Godfather' in the pastiche-Gordon Willis murky cinematography, the emphasis on (alternative) 'family' values over the threats of the outside world, and the use of the crime genre to explore the dark centre of American corporate, legal and governmental power.<br />But the Coppola film 'Rain' most resembles is 'Apocalypse Now', albeit in diluted form.  Like Willard, Rudy tells his own story, trying to control messy experience.  He is less honest than Willard, and winds up looking like the beacon of integrity he sees himself as, full of sententious self-importance.  But Coppola emphasises the Southern Gothic inherent in Grisham's narrative.  The principle of Gothic is opposed to that of Law and Reason, and one of the best scenes here shows the signing of a legal document, which makes Rudy look like an exploiter, turn into something from horror, a nosebleed, disintegration of the body, blood all over the document.  <br />The crucial scene - where Rudy fights against the wife-beating husband of the woman he loves - is deeply shocking, reason and legality giving way to violence and desire, as he finds a cowardly way to get the girl bypassing a lengthy legal process.  It's the old Lawrence adage about American literature, the disparity between the teller and the tale, making 'Rain' infinitely more fascinating than its bland courtroom surface.
006016848X|4.0|This book is great as a way of understanding how our culture trains boys and girls to be different. We teach girls that they can cry when they're sad, talk about their feelings, and share experiences with each other. We teach boys that they need to 'buck up' and be manly, to hide the tears, to face it like a man, to be the rock on which the females can rely. It is no surprise that these lessons affect adults, and affect how male and females relate (or fail to relate) to each other.<br />In essence, a few core themes run through the book, being supported by various examples, and different wording that help make the points clear.<br />First, men are goal-oriented, internalizing, and when they are stressed, &quot;retreat to a cave&quot; to consider what to do. They want to come to a solution on their own, and *then* emerge. To try to help them while they are in the &quot;cave&quot; is counter productive.<br />Men want to be trusted and admired. This is the whole Knight-in-Armor, John Wayne, Rambo training we have given men. They want to feel that the woman believes in them. To question a man is to show your doubt. The book recommends if your man is lost while driving, or forgets something while travelling, to just be quiet and accept it. It will show your trust in him to get there eventually or to solve the problem. I'm personally not sure if tihs is always wise advice.<br />Women, on the other hand, are nurturing, expressive, feeling individuals who tend to use poetic license such as saying &quot;you ALWAYS forget to do that chore&quot; or &quot;you NEVER listen to me&quot;. The advice given to men is to take what women say with a grain of salt, and not to react to any of it literally. Most of what women want, according to the book, is just to be heard. Women don't want solutions or answers. They want to feel that their feelings are being heard and understood ... they want to be held and be told &quot;Yes, yes, I understand&quot;. The book explains that men make the mistake of thinking women tell them things in order for the men to *fix* those things. Instead, the women tell them things in order to share their feelings, but aren't seeking actual resolutions.<br />While I agree that women are trained to share feelings and to sometimes be overly emotional, to tell a man that women never want resolutions, and always exaggerate, is not treating a woman as a logical human being perfectly capable of wanting answers.<br />There is definitely a lot of helpful information in the book. It is of course good to show trust in your husband. It is important to understand what your wife *means* and not just pick apart what she literally has *said*. It is good to understand that society trains men to &quot;retreat&quot; to consider problems, and that they consider interference during this time as &quot;harassment&quot; instead of &quot;helpful&quot;. It's good to realize that women have emotional cycles and can sometimes be happy, and sometimes sad, and that nobody is always happy.<br />However, be sure to read the book as a guideline on how to help your relationship, and not as a Bible which has the exact ways in which you and your special partner can relate to each other. It definitely has interesting hints and tips, and interesting stories to share. It also has many generalizations that, for many individuals, simply do not apply.istake of thinking women tell them things in order for the men to *fix* those things.

B00005NWM3|5.0|I find it irritating that the reviewer above chose to make comparisons between those no talent assclowns, Staind and Nickelback.  Nickelback is so far superior to Staind its apalling to mention them together.  Staind wrote one song that caught on because it had Fred Durst's name on it.  Since then, they have re-written and re-released the same song 3 or 4 times.<BR>Nickelback however writes some great rock tunes with more inspired bass lines, guitar riffs, and hooks, not to mention less annoying lyrics.<BR>If you have heard the first single &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; and like it, you will most likely enjoy this CD.  The tunes on here are all generally similar caliber rock songs.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I have been listening to BD for 25 years (both live and on disk) and this album raises the hair on the back of my neck.  If &quot;Time out of Mind&quot; was the vision of life as mortal, &quot;Love and Theft&quot; is that dirge turned inside out -- when all there is left to do is dance, reminisce, get silly and make puns.  It's &quot;How does it feel?&quot; merged with &quot;something is happening here but you don't know what it is&quot;, put to the music of &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot; and &quot;Planet Waves&quot; and even &quot;Saved&quot;.<br />The guy just has more tricks up his sleeve than any other working singer/songwriter out there.  Let's face it, when they unearth the heart of folk music of America 100 years from now, they are going to look at &quot;Good as I been to you&quot; and this album as key examples of the treasure trove of Dylan's work.<br />Let's hear it for it him, in between all the touring and who know what else, he stills gets himself in to work in the studio and walks out having gotten his job done.  Right on, Bob.
B000021YQV|5.0|I cannot believe just how good this cd is. It's not like they just rehashed self entitled like some other bands follow up cds seem to do (Staind, Sevendust), System grew, but didn't lose their roots. The opening 30 seconds of Prison Song I was Like 'Oh please don't turn into start stop metal' (The only problem I have with Mudvayne). Then the song kicked in, and I thanked my lucky stars. The trademark of System to me was the oddness of what their songs almost always do, and the fact that no matter how heavy the song seems to be, there is always an underlying melody to it. There is an element of comedy to them, take prison song &quot;I buy my........right here in Hollywood.&quot; But their music still holds its center. I would not recomend this to everyone, simply because of it's oddness, but if you liked the first one then this will blow you away.<br />I love all the songs but the standouts are &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; which should've been extended for another 3 minutes, &quot;Prison Song&quot;, &quot;atwa&quot; (which reminds me somewhat of spiders because of the end with the ascending guitar chords), &quot;Ariels&quot;, and my favorite &quot;Forrest&quot;. Forrest is truly amazing, its heavy, but has melody, and the chorus and the end where the song speeds up is so cool (listen to it, you'll know what I mean).<br />For your own sake buy this, to keep your sanity (or to Lose it).
0553274503|4.0|Charlie Gordon has an IQ of 60 and can't even beat a lab mouse named Algernon in races through mazes (the mouse in the maze, Charlie tracing with his hand). It turns out that Algernon has been surgically &quot;enhanced&quot; by a special procedure to increase his intellegence. The scientists want a human subject, and Charlie is their choice, mainly because his immediate family is no part of his life, and because Charlie has always had a dim desire to &quot;become smarter,&quot; noted by a teacher at his special school.<br />The novel is the story of Charlie, told in his own words through &quot;progris riports&quot; as a type of diary. His story is mirrored by that of Algernon. The scientists treat Charlie as little more than a lab animal, proclaiming at a conference that they made him into a real human being. It's only slowly that Charlie starts to gain intellegence, and this is the heart of the book - his rapid strides forward in intellegence and knowledge, but unfortunately not in emotional development. Memories of childhood abandonment and abuse come back to haunt him which severely hinder his ability to love and grow emotionally. When Algernon starts to decay - he becomes erratic and starts to grow stupid - no one knows if it will also happen to Charlie. This tension lends the narrative a tension that adds poignancy to the second half of the book.<br />This is not a traditional science fiction story - nothing is told of the details of the operation or the science behind it. Why it won the Nebula is a bit of a mystery. However, it is a very good story, well written and heartfelt. A story like this must be written in the first person, and it's done very effectively here - you get into the head of Charlie and care for him and the people he cares about. Some of the minor characters are stereotyped - for instance, all of the scientists (in fact, all the university professors) are pompous and arrogant. But the vast majority of the book is very good, and recommended.
0783228317|4.0|You will either &quot;get&quot; this film and really enjoy it or you will be left speechliess thinking you just wasted 2 hours of your life. It's all a matter of where you are coming from. If you are familiar with or have read any of Thompsons work you will get it (if not, go out and start reading!!). If you are of above average intelligence and have ever experienced and altered state you will get it. In any case, as your lawyer I would advise you to give it a try.<br />The film is a great adaptation of Thompsons book of the same title. I had already read the book years prior to when this film came out. I was impressed. It can be mind candy. It can be a critical look at the excess that is America. It can be pointless rambling. In any case, it is pure Thompson - which Depp does a fantastic job portraying. <br />The one thing about this film is it was quite a journey seeing it on the big screen. When my buddy &amp; I left the theater and walked outside to the car WE felt like we were the ones taking part in &quot;the trip&quot;. So I must applaud Gilliam for &quot;really driving it home&quot;. The visual effects are quite astounding and they will stay with you for a while - so don't say I didn't warn you about the bats!!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Didn't think it would happen. All the hyped up fluff that was offered was always a letdown. Then I saw &quot;Memento&quot; and my faith in the entertainment business of making movies was restored to an extent. What a refreshing, absolutely stunning great movie. I don't want to get carried away with adjectives but it lived up to all the hype I had heard on the net about it. The story is not original but the way it's told is. The movie is told backwards with the end at the beginning, but we are given a narrative that is unique in the way it's told to get to that end. Leonard Shelby, who is played exquisitely by Guy Pearce (who is always great in the movies I've seen him in, why hasn't he been up for the Oscar by the way????) is the haunting, tortured main character who's life has been destroyed in one fell sweep by two criminals who raped and murdered his wife and in defending her he suffers an injury which destroys his ability to make new memories. Even with that severe handicap he sets out on a mission to get revenge. What a great theme, and Christopher Nolan the director and screenwriter tells it to us in a way that is unforgettable. Joe Pantoliano of &quot;The Matrix&quot; fame is his friend (or enemy??) who sets out to help him on this quest, and Carrie-Anne Moss (also from &quot;The Matrix&quot; provides the femme fatale character, and the two of them complement Guy Pearce'S great performance very well. Joe Pantoliano's is able to inject humor, empathy, and charm in his character and Carrie-Anne Moss provides some good eye candy and and excellent acting as well. Even though the theme is serious it has it's funny moments too, and this helped to relieve some of the tenseness of the strong scenes that I found myself caught up in along with Leonard Shelby. Please take the time to see this movie and view it with an open mind and patience. Once you &quot;get it&quot;, and that may take more concentration than you're used to giving a movie, I just can't see why the &quot;getting it&quot; will not be the most entertainment adventure you've had with movies so far this year. You won't forget it!!! BTW, Guy Pearce is pretty darned good looking in this movie too!

044022425X|5.0|It took me two years before I was to pick up and read Ms Gabaldon's books, as the notion of reading a time travel romance was off-putting to say the least.  However, after much encouragement from a friend, I finally took the plunge.  To date, I have not come up for air.   I haven't read anything this good since James Herriot (All Creatures Great and Small).  Speaking of James, Diana creates wonderful character's, and James and Claire are no exception.  My life has not been the same since reading the Outlander series, and I often find myself reflecting on the lives and times of her character's.   Her books are so good, that it is heartbreaking to finish them.  And so, upon finishing her fourth book, Drums of Autumn, I turned right around and started the series all over again.   I eagerly await her fifth book, The Fiery Cross, which continues the story of Jamie and Claire.  Thankyou Ms Gabaldon, for providing me with a safe sanctuary to go to on rainy days.
0767818040|3.0|I could hardly wait to see this movie, having so much heard about it. the truth is that i was a little bit disappointed, 'cause you know from the start who the murder is. the main actor is a pretty boring man (i know why he didn't make it in Hollywood), and the film has no rythm. Only Melanie Griffith is worth seeing (a great influence on '86 Madonna's look).<BR>that's all folks,<BR>R.+ S.
0380973634|5.0|In this story, Neil Gaiman takes the readers on a wild ride through the dangerous but fascinating world of London Below.  No one is who they seem, and strange and exciting things are around every corner.  Each character is painstakingly developed; these aren't your run-of-the-mill people.  A girl who has the power to open any door (even when there is none) who is on a journey to find out who murdered her family.  A con artist who takes payment in the form of huge favors.  A woman who is legendary as the Hunter.  And finally, an average man who got sucked into their strange world through an act of kindness.  Neverwhere takes you away from your own reality and transports you right to London Below, where you walk right by the characters.  You mourn when tragedy happens, you rejoice when they are triumphant, and you hold your breath with anticipation with every new danger they encounter.  The reason that this story is so enticing is because most people can relate to the main character.  He's an ordinary man who just got...stuck in his life.  But suddenly something happens and he's on an adventure where he sees and experiences things that he could never have even imagined.  Everyone gets bored of life once in awhile, but by reading Neverwhere, you loose yourself in London Below, where things are anything but dull.
0812550706|4.0|What Earth needs, is a hero. A genius hero, and fast. How is a genius created, and be made a hero against one's will? To save the Earth, must a genius be taught, and desire to kill? Mustn't a hero empathize with the enemy, to know them better than they know themselves? What if the enemy can do the same? What must be done to unlock superior potential?<br />In a future military state worldwide, Andrew Wiggin was unorthodoxly authorized to improve upon his siblings' best qualities. He was breed to have his brother Peter's intelligence and cunning and his sister Valentine's manner and instinct. Ender, as he calls himself, is a genius among geniuses, which is why he is chosen for the elite Battle School training. Having been antagonized by others, especially Peter, all through his life, Ender would have gladly left Earth for the Battle School; if not for the reciprocal love of Valentine. At the school, Ender is purposely thrown against one adversary situation after another, thoroughly defeating each one. The school has studies of the art of war, but most importantly, it has the Battle Rooms: 0-G combat simulators. For the purpose of interstellar war and challenge of Ender's abilities, he is advanced through training and the school itself all too quickly. In doing so, has lost his soul? In the mean time, Peter and Valentine may destroy what Ender is trying to protect. Now the human race rests upon the shoulders of a pre-adolescent, whether Ender knows it or not.<br />Ender's Game is a cerebral infusion of the tortured, grown up mind of Ender. He is constantly manipulated, which brings out many different things in him, and the reader, every time. Indifference, anger, resolve, respect, remorse, guilt, and sometimes joy. Ender's Game (paperback author's definite edition) is not like the Sci-fi genre, but a plunge into the motive and conscience of a deep protagonist. This book rests on the empathy of the reader to accept volatile minds in children. Unfortunately, if you immerse yourself too far (as it's very possible) into the characters, some of the intended, unpredictable shocks may be deadened. The introduction gives much insight into the author. This book is great for all readers and those looking for something new; although the following series requires adroit interest in all aspects of the novel. Ender's Game is definitely worth enjoying.
B000003TA4|2.0|Musical shifts....moments when popular taste turns on a dime...are spread throughout the last 50 years. They happen rather naturally, and are NOT due to any one person or group. Thus I cannot help but roll my eyes each time I hear that Nirvana, who had the first hit of one of these musical shifts, mistakenly given credit for the shift itself. Anybody alive in 1989 will tell you that the things that had defined 80's rock were feeling stale and repetitive, and that people were hungry for change. The return to rock that was so poorly labelled grunge was just about destined to occur at that point.<BR>However, I am not judging this record based on the undeserving credit it recieves. I am judging it on the music....<BR>I don't listen to radio much, and I don't even have a TV, so I don't know if these songs continue to be the center of massive attention (I do know that many of Pearl Jam's hits from the era are still played fairly regularly....a shame because they've been so much better since 1995). But I do know that as someone who was a teen in 1991 it's hard for many of the early songs on the album to seem new or fresh. They certainly aren't bad songs. I've never been a fan of Kurt's lyricism, nor of the repetition that plagues much of this album, but they aren't detrimental to the music in any way. There's just not much going on, and what does go on is fairly on the surface and limited to one emotion. It does have it's moments...the opening of Come As You Are, the first moment to show that Kurt doesn't need a fuzz pedal and a power chord to write a song, is extremely cool. Dave Grohl (ironically, the most talented songwriter in the band) is absolutely essential for Kurt's stylings. His drumming gives some moments the energy they need, and does a lot to provide the soft/loud transitions into the choruses. Also enjoyable are Polly and Something in the Way. They're both accoustic, but Kurt doesn't alter his songwriting in any way to fit the instrument, and so what we're left with are very intimate sounding (and very welcome) breaks. Kurt also absorbed his punk influences very well (as evidenced in Territorial Pissings). But whlie individual songs are often enjoyable, the record as a whole (which is what I'm reviewing) simply comes across as too singular, limited in scope, and, to me, uninteresting. Kurt's screaming is urgent, unquestionably, but too often he's not saying anything with it.<BR>Even if I liked them more, I could never consider Nirvana great, simply because for every great record he has, artists like Pearl Jam or Springsteen have 3 more, and artists like Dylan have 8 or 9. I don't think that quantity is near as important as quality, but I do believe the two need to work in tandem to create a truly great artist, and it's a shame that the industry right now thrives on momentary chart toppers rather than artistic and inventive artists like Kurt could have become.
0743216458|2.0|Unless you're a real military history buff, reading about battle isn't as fascinating as one might think.  I love history - particularly World War Two - so I was excited to read Ambrose's  book, particularly in light of the HBO miniseries. For the first 150 or so pages, I found the book compelling not just as history but as a vivid account of the human spirit and resiliency under extreme conditions.  Unfortunately, my interest started to wane at the halfway point as Ambrose lays on thick the American patriotic chest-thumping.  While America certainly helped bring WW2 to a close, this book portrays the British as a bunch of disorganized . (A common characteristic I've found in American literature written about the era.) The British withstood the Nazis for two years before America came in.  To portray them as anything less than heroes does them a severe disservice  and fatally taints what should have been an enlightening read. <br />Based on the first two episodes of HBO's miniseries adaptation, in this case, I recommend skipping the book in favor of the movie where, rather ironically, the role of Winters, unquestionably Easy Company's most stalwart hero, is brilliantly played by a Brit.
B00005LE3Q|5.0|FRENCH CANCAN is arguably Renoir's best film in the 1950s (rivalled only by THE GOLDEN COACH and THE RIVER). It may well be the best filmization of that oft-filmed musical hall story, Moulin Rouge. It surely beats the hell out of John Huston's colourful but basically vacuous ..., or any other contender. <br />FRENCH CANCAN is a wonderful example of the kind of farcical frivolity that characterizes Renoir's work in the 50s. In a sense, the film struck me as a semi-sequel to the magical GOLDEN COACH, although CANCAN is much more intricate and restrained work. Both films are uniquely similar in that they never venture outside the theatre. Some critics have rudely charged the film for being too stagey and theatrical, but what the critics fail to see is that Renoir celebrates the theatricality of movies: He finds energy and vigour in the theatre functioning as a profound metaphor for life.<br />But what's so special about FRENCH CANCAN, aside from the exquisite colour, music, and dance numbers, is the way it understands that the wonderful world of the theatre is a result of hard and painful work. As the film proceeds, it leaves behind some hurtful feelings. Some of them are not reconciled. And Jean Gabin, in one of his greatest performances, is very adept at conveying these sombre feelings. Nonetheless, such feelings become thing of a past when the film reaches its spectacular finale, with the gusto of swirling cancan dancers. <br />FRENCH CANCAN is the most passionate and invigorating work of Renoir's late period. It is also my second favourite Renoir after THE RULES OF THE GAME.
1859849296|4.0|Hitchens is willing to go places no one else will.  Here he examines the real life and actions of a modern day icon.  He raises real concerns and questions about Mother Theresa's actions and alliances.  I would have given the book a 5 but, to be honest, some of it seemed extreme in its criticism.  I would definitely recommend reading this book to at least create awareness of the possible hypocrisies that do exist with this extraordinary woman's life.

0062502182|4.0|To contrast with some who might say that this book is borig, I had to read this book for a class of mine.  However, I happened to think that it was so good that I have finished probably several weeks ahead of my class.  This book, as you may well know from reading the other reviews, is about a young shepherd named Santiago living in Andelusia, Spain.  He has had a dream two times in a month and goes to a fortune teller to get an interpretation.  He then meets an old man who says he is the &quot;King of Salem&quot; who helps him to decide whether on not to go to find the treasure he has invisioned in his dreams.  My favorite part of in this section, maybe because I just finished writing a three-page essay about it, was when the old man tells Santiago the story about the young man going to the wisest man in the world for the secret to happiness and it's moral &quot;See all the wonders of the world, but never forget the drops of oil.&quot;  All in all, I think this is a wonderful book, though for some it may be hard to get into.  I wasn't for me, but then again, I am, as it says, a Fantasy Freak.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|A few months ago the music press dusted down their Bob Dylan obituaries, changed everything from the past to the present tense, and called it a celebration of Dylan's sixtieth birthday.  Typically, Dylan took no public part in the celebrations.<br />\\"I blew out some candles, ate some cake, and went to bed,\\" he told the Times.<br />He managed a little more too, spending a couple of weeks in a New York studio in mid-May, on a break from his ongoing touring.<br />With Dylan at the production desk the album was quickly recorded and mixed.<br />Dylan and his band were joined by keyboardist Augie Meyers, who reported that the sessions were workmanlike, thoroughly enjoyable, with Dylan penning extra verses between takes as needed.<br />The result, \\"Love And Theft\\", Dylan's 39th studio album, positively hums with brilliance.<br />Though it sounds little like the Grammy-winning \\"Time Out Of Mind\\", the new album fits right in with Bob's musical journey through the past decade or so.<br />In 1991 he released a collection of old folk and blues songs on \\"Good As I Been To You\\".  A year later the more focused collection, \\"World Gone Wrong\\", popped out.<br />Dylan was delving deep back into his musical roots, shaking the dust off his battered copy of the \\"Anthology of American Folk Music\\" and clearing the dust from his own head.  \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" came along in 1997, loaded with musical and lyrical references to myriad blues, folk and country songs.  Old timey and bang up to date, the album was a huge success. <br />Four years on comes the next instalment and it is every bit as good.<br />A condensed, densely packed, pocket-sized version of Bob Dylan's America, \\"Love And Theft\\" sounds like nothing else you'll hear all year<br />From barroom blues to gentle swing, the 12 songs here cover a huge geographical territory: from the Deep South to Appalachia, from Florida to the Iron Range.  The America that emerges is a feral country, barely a step away from the wild. <br />Full of hope, large skies and boundless possibility, this America is also ruthless, brutal and casually cruel.  Dylan sings of honeybees buzzing and flowers blooming in the gently swaying Floater.  A few verses later he's warning that he's not to be messed with.<br />Dylan narrates his way around this landscape, observing odd characters and weird locations, from the troublesome Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, who initially sound like a pair of loose-limbed eejits but who by song's end you'd not want to meet even on a well lit street, to the Po' Boy who can't put a foot right.<br />Romeo and Juliet drift by, as do Othello and Desdemona, immigrants to this restless nation; Darwin crops up, stranded out on Highway 5, his future looking dodo-bright; and seemingly plain folks all would fillet and skillet the unwary in a trice.  Dylan shrugs his shoulders, makes a note in his book, and remarks about the changing weather and changing locations.<br />It is a rich confection indeed.<br />But all this musical arcana would mean little if the thing didn't sound so damned good.<br />Dylan and his band are in perfect synch, honed into a versatile and duck's arse tight unit by the endless touring.  <br />Whether cutting loose on \\"Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum\\" or on \\"Honest With Me\\" (which crackles and zips like an updated \\"Highway 61\\") or taking it gentle on \\"Po' Boy\\" and \\"High Water\\" Dylan and his band are a perfect musical unit.  Effortlessly, they take on and a variety of styles and sounds, cutting a swathe across musical America.  If it all goes pear shaped they'd make a hell of a decent living on the wedding and 21st circuit.<br />Jorge Luis Borges said that with the best poetry there is a thrill, an almost physical emotion, which comes with each reading.  The lyrics, Dylan's singing, and phrasing, and that razor sharp sound, together make \\"Love And Theft\\" a truly thrilling thing.  Poetry it may not be; a stirring, striking, and hugely enjoyable collection it certainly is.<br />Dylan effortlessly recovers the past with these songs.  I imagine that this is the musical landscape that the teenage Dylan dreamt up living through those long cold Iron Range winters, his radio tuned to stations from Memphis and New Orleans broadcasting weird and wonderful tunes.<br />Dylan told USA Today \\"I think of it more as a greatest-hits album, volume one or volume two.  Without the hits - not yet, anyway.\\"  And you know, he wasn't far wrong.<br />\\"Love And Theft\\" is a gem.
B00005NEZ3|5.0|The entire CD is excellent, only track I don't like is Rock the House(don't like rap). Turely something I enjoy listening to.
B000053VAF|5.0|This is the DVD to top all DVD's!  I have never seen a DVD with more special features.  There are things on this DVD that will keep you busy for a week or two.  The deleted scenes are hysterical and so is the whole layout of the DVD. If you enjoy watching Dogma or any Kevin Smith movie, this is a must buy!  Stop fooling around and buy this damn DVD!
B00003CXIY|3.0|This isn't anywhere near the best movie I have ever seen. But it isn't the worst. The characters are quite likable and even though they don't always do the right thing you still root for them. At the end it was worth watching.
B000059MEK|5.0|Even though i've only heard the first 4 songs on Toonami.com , i am really impressed with it. The ONLY other songs that i've listened to more than 37 times in one sitting, are parodies called &quot;Regurge&quot;. If I wasn't a 15 year old, I'd buy it in a heart-beat:). I was really impressed with &quot;Harder, better, faster, stronger.&quot; At first you think the lyrics are random words, but you soon find out how they come together... of course i had to listen to it like 20 times (not an exaggeration) to figure that out. I'm either slow, or I really did not notice nor care because... well I love it!! Also the music videos (also on toonami.com) were really awesome and I really love the work the creators did. GOOD JOB!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002BPS|5.0|How can you not like the offspring?  These guys basically introduced me to the punk sound ever since I listened to &quot;Smash&quot; I knew I was hooked.  When you put this CD in your CD Player, Discman etc. make sure to strap in your seatbealt, because you are in for one hell of a ride.  From &quot;The meaning of life&quot; all the way to &quot;Change the world&quot; I can't bring myself to skip one track, I've owned this one since 1997 and I'm still kickin it loud to this day.
B00003CY3W|5.0|Amazing.  This movie represents Indy films at their best.  After seeing Memento and this film mainstream movies are no longer on my list of movies to be seen.  Everyone who loves a great teenager angry at the world movie needs to run to your local theater to see this movie.  No words justify this movie.  See it now.
B00004T9UF|5.0|On Eminem's previous release &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; we were introduced to the immature white MC who rapped about what he wanted, when he wanted and didn't give a damn what you or anyone else thought.  But when the &quot;Marshall Mathers LP&quot; came out the wolrd was forced to meet a new slim shady, a much darker &amp; more stressed out MC who was more fed up with the world than ever.  The only way for him to release this constant stress? On his latest album, for 90% of the songs.  This album conatins some of the more serious and angry sounds of &quot;Kill you&quot;, &quot;Stan&quot;, &quot;The Way I Am&quot;, &quot;Remember Me?&quot;, &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot;, &quot;Amityville&quot;, and the always controversial &quot;Kim&quot;.  Also are songs remniscent of Slim's older days on tracks &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; (Great song, but played out), &quot;I'm back&quot;, &quot;Drug Ballad&quot; &amp; &quot;Under the influence&quot;.  Great album, or as my friend Zepplin21 put it &quot;A dark, noir classic&quot;.
0790749815|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock made an extraordinary film in North By Northwest, and it includes some of his most amazing cinematography.  It's astounding to think that the &quot;special effects&quot; are based on the real locations involved, since CGI was certainly not available in the day this was made.  Cary Grant is excellent as a man on the run in a case of mistaken identity.  I was hooked within the first 15 minutes of this excellent film.  The DVD looks better than the film has looked in years.  Likely as good or better than it did upon first theatrical release.  The special features are just the icing on the cake.
B000002BBY|5.0|This CD definetly holds a place in my heart for the memories it brings back, and the classic songs it displays.  &quot;Wonderwall&quot; &amp; &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot; were really the ones that sold me over on it back in 1995, and I remember being very pleased listening to it for the first time.  Personally though I dont buy into their whole theory of being &quot;The greatest rock band of the 90's&quot;, no offense guys you are talented and all but lets not get to full of ourselves...but then again that is part of the rock n roll ego, so go ahead and self indulge, even though I still dont agree with you ;O)
B000021Y77|5.0|I bought Run Lola Run on a whim, and instantly became a fan of Franka Potente (Lola) and Tom Tykwer (Director/Writer).  Lola is an amazing story of just how far we will go, and how hard we will try for those we love.  The film is constantly in motion, as Lola has 20 minutes to get 100,000 DM$ or her boyfriend Manny's life will be in jeopardy.  The 81 minute film covers these twenty minutes, and does so in a very interesting way.  I became so immersed in the film, that I began to forget the characters were speaking in German.  There is also an English dub available, but the German sountrack is superior.  The image on the DVD is excellent, and the commentary is also worth a listen.  Definitely worth the price of admission.
B00005NZBN|5.0|Whether you are a Bob Dylan footsoldier or merely appreciate his somgwriting ability, this is a must have piece of work!  His songwriting seems to only get better with age.  After his Award wining 1997 album, &quot;Time out of mind&quot;, this is a follow up that leaves the listener wondering how he can get any better!  In contrast to the dark and moody lyrics and strings of &quot;Time out of Mind&quot;, &quot;Love And Theft&quot; is decidedly upbeat.  Bob plays with the serenade and teeters on the edge of some rock-a-billy, with that Bob touch of course.  Gentle serenades like moonlight or the gritty Po'Boy will remind everyone why Bob Dylan is a legend in the music world.  His music, thoughts, words and resonance are unmatched.<br />Please enjoy....I just can't stop listening to it!
B00005NOZ6|5.0|Simplemente brutal. Los que hayais visto el video o el DVD ya sabreis de lo que os hablo. Un concierto maravilloso. Tocan entero su último disco &quot;Scenes From A Memory&quot; y después repasan los mejores éxitos de su carrera. Como siempre mención especial a Mike Portnoy y a John Petrucci que son el mejor batería y el mejor guitarrista del mundo.<BR>Os recomiendo que lo compreis YA!
006092988X|5.0|This story is basically about the struggle to overcome adversity.<br />It chronicles the childhood of Francie Nolan, a very wise girl, mature past her years, who grows up in the mean slums of turn-of-the-century Brooklyn, New York. <br />In spite of quite a terrible childhood, filled with indignities, unfairness, and pain, Francie is determined to succeed, so that she may rise up above her surroundings. Although she must leave school before getting to high school, to work in a factory, she fights her way back to an education, eventually making it to college and out of Brooklyn. <br />Francie's fight out of the slums is truly inspiring--like the &quot;Tree of Heaven&quot; that grows out the broken cement of the sidewalk, she fights through setbacks and never gives up. What I found to be especially wonderful was the fact that Betty Smith made no character all good or all bad. This enables the reader to feel what the character is feeling, and understand their motive in doing what they do. Thus the story is felt and experienced on many different levels and in many different ways.<br />I really love this book and I would recommend it to everyone.
0783114222|5.0|It is a part of history that will never be forgotten. The goal is incredible, we all know roughly what happened but the tension is still there.<br />My 3 year old son was fascinated, we watched one episode every night or so together as a family - it was great fun. I highly recommend it for everyone.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Bob Dylan has produced the greatest album in his catalog.<br />Not since &quot;Blood On The Tracks&quot; has there been a Dylan album which is incredible in it's scope, while remaining intimate to the listener. Whether it's the touching &quot;Sugar Baby&quot;, the driving rhythms of &quot;Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum&quot;, or the honky-tonk feel of &quot;Lonesome Day Blues&quot;, his skills has a muscian and as a songwriter are at their peak.<br />With the incredible sucess of &quot;Things Have Changed&quot; from the &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; soundtrack, one would think Dylan would keep in the same vein, but he takes the theme of reflection upon one's self and offers us many aspects on that, while taking the listener on an American music history lesson. Whether it's the Blues, Honky-Tonk, straight ahead Rock, he has managed to give the world a breif history of American music and styles, while remaining unique and never cliched.<br />This is a must have in everybody's CD collection. Even if you're not a Dylan fan, this would be the one CD to represent the most important voice in American music, if not the world.
B0000027F3|5.0|This is the best CD by Judas Priest my favorite band. It has everything a Judas Priest fan needs. GET IT!
B000002HRE|4.0|Although nothing near as good as the first three albums. For Re-Load, the Metallica boys stuck a bit closer to what they know- load, fast, in-your-face metal music. Fewer of the songs sounded overly experimental or out of place. <BR>Not to mention, I love Maryanne Faithful in &quot;The Memory Remains.&quot; I also think that &quot;Fuel&quot; is quite possibly one of the best songs for driving really fast to. <BR>This CD is a great addition to any Metallica fan's collection and complements many of the bands talents.
B00003CXWV|4.0|Blow is one of those movies you watch twice at the movies, and the buy the DVD. Its one of those movies that has that &quot;it&quot; that makes you feel good about paying to watch it (and about paying to buy the DVD). The whole story is great and the script is very, very well developed; fast-paced but never loosing its sense of order; the lessons it teaches about life and about destiny will impact you, mostly because of the great acting by Depp and Liotta; and the movies follows itself throughout with good music and greatly created scenes.<BR>     &quot;BLOW&quot; is by far one of the best movies in recent memories, and its actors, screenplay, and storyline make it what it is.
6305014140|5.0|I don't watch much cartoon but theese is a great movie, regardless. Action packed. If I were you, I would watch this. We dun need no stinkin badges, we have swords. Watch this movie,regardless.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Michael Bay - he doesn't direct a film, he just runs it through the camera.<br />It's hard to believe that so much money was spent on this film (in production costs and marketing), yet not more than a buck-ninety-five was spent on the script. Was Braveheart a fluke for Randall Wallace and did Mel Gibson bring more to it than we know?<br />It's one thing to expect the most banal popcorn movies from Bay and Bruckheimer, but this one set the new (low) standard and demonstrated once again the creative bankruptcy that plagues modern Hollywood.<br />It's nice to know that we can take liberties with history the way Bay did. He appears to be the kind of director who would cast Tara Reid or Shannon Elizabeth as Cleopatra and Freddie Prinz, Jr as Mark Antony.<br />As a director, he has poor understanding of human relationships onscreen and has effectively failed film drama 101. Do we even care for the characters or the bevy of servicemen who &quot;died&quot;? 'Cause I know I didn't care for not one of the sailors caught on the sinking ships (except for the fact that I was looking for friends who said they were extras in the film)! Does an Oscar-winner like Cube Gooding, Jr. deserve to be reduced a near-silent film role (even though he was barely in the movie, he had the most effective and telling scenes)? As an African-American actor portraying a real hero there was an opportunity to explore part of Pearl Harbor that we never knew, but I guess that would be ground breaking. Is there ever a moment in this film that we don't know what is going to happen next? Is there anything more revealing about those events that wasn't explored in such films as Tora! Tora! Tora! Did the special effects fight sequence have to be so repetitive?<br />One could go on and on, but that's not the point. A film like this should point viewers in the direction of great cinema that cover the great conflict of the 20th centurty, i.e. The Sand Pebbles, 12 O'clock High, The Dirty Dozen, Stalag 17, Hell In the Pacific to name a few. But this film, much like Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (and upcoming Band of Brothers) ushers in a new type of WWII cinema that isn't as appealing. A type that brackets (and thereby creatively controls) the events of the story with a major, much researched real event. A film like The Dirty Dozen or Where Eagles Dare (another underrated gem that needs to be on DVD) fictionalizes pretty much everything except for the fact that it's WWII to great drama effect. How can forget characters like Cassavettes's Franko or Marvin's Major Reisman. There characters didn't fight in any &quot;real&quot; battles, but they sure as hell fought the good fight in a very compelling movie. The same can't be said for the woeful Affleck and the shallow Hartnett (their characters don't even illict memorable names much less performances).the Pacific to name a few.

0790729725|5.0|This movie is a great ganster film with great stars like Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci. Speaking of Joe Pesci, I saw him once while I was walking in the streets of L.A. He was picking up some clothing from the cleaners when I decided to get his autograph. I was about to walk up to him when I realized I had no pen or paper for his signiture, so I ran a block to my car to get something for him to sign. When I got to my car I checked in the glove compartment for pen and paper. All I found was a pencil and a scrap piece of paper which already had writing on it. I was going to have him sign the back when I realized that this scrap piece of paper was a shopping list my grandmother gave me a week before. She specifically asked me to buy the things on her list for a birthday party she was giving my grandfather, which was that same day. I only had 5 hours to buy everything and give it to my grandmother so she could prepare it for the party. Most of the things were hard to find, so I was driving all around L.A. in a panic. On my way to a store I was flagged down by a group of cholos drinking in front of some house. I thought I was going to get jumped, but when I got closer I realized I knew them all. They were my homies back in juvie hall about four years back. It was good to see them all. Lefty, Angel, Joker, Paco, Gordo, Siesta, and Doc. It was like a reunion. They asked me to stay and drink with them but I told them I only had time for a few because of my dilema. My homies always backed me up, so they said they would take care of it for me. They told me to stay in the house and drink a few beers while they all go out and find the things that I need. I agreed and they all left. 15 minutes later I heard a knock at the door. When I opened the door it was an old cholo all covered with tatts.He called himself El Gato. He asked for Doc and gave me a bag to give to him. But before he would leave he wanted me to take a hit of the blow to show him that I wasnt 5-O. So Itook a hit and passed out like a chump. When I hit the floor El Gato dropped the bag and took off. He probably thought I died or something. An hour later my homies came back and found me unconscious on the floor. Doc recognized who the bag belonged to and immediately took my homies to El Gato's cribb so they could do some damage. After they took care of El Gato they came to my aid but couldnt get me up. I was out like a light. They didn't know what to do so they called Maria, Paco's sister, thinking maybe she could do something. When she got there she kissed me on the lips and I slowly opened my eyes. She was the first thing I saw. She was talking to me but I was a little disoriented. Looking at her lips move I started to get my berrings back. When I finally understood what she was saying I heard her say, &quot; Aye Poppy, chu are de fairest one of all. Give me anudder kiss, babee!&quot; As I looked at her I saw a 5 foot 2 inch, 180 pound 38 year old cha cha. Not gonna happen. I got my grandmothers stuff and got the heck out of there, with my homies yelling and laughing telling me to comeback and visit again. Anyways, If you havent seen Goodfellas yet, rent it or buy it. It's a great gangster movie.
B00004RJ71|5.0|Blood In, Blood Out is a sterling example of the Chicano cinema of the late eighties and early nineties.  Along with films like American Me, it demonstrated many of the struggles of an increasing population of Mexican-Americans in a very serious style opposite to that of Born in East L.A. (still very funny).  As Latinos have come more into the mainstream, flicks like these have not been embraced but, it seems, forgotten and neglected. This film is extremely lengthy but engrossing from start to finish.  It deals with violence, drug addiction, and the function of the family in a Mexican neighborhood in Los Angeles. East Los Angeles is a stone's throw from where I grew up and this film is very versimilar and it has many poignant moments.  Best of all, this film is an indicment of the penal system which has become unsafe and meaningless in the course of the last thirty to forty years.  Blood In, Blood Out should not be missed by any type of thinker, it has appeals to the blue collar concern (note its popularity in the armed forces) and to the more academically-oriented.  Check this one out!
B00004Z311|1.0|What is it with this movie?  It has the potential to be a great movie because of the caliber of actors and the great scenery, but the plot is too slow for an adult.  In fact, a child would really love it except for the fact that there's a demon on it that would scare the Heck out of them and give them nightmares for a week!  I was expecting a much better movie.
B00002MZ4V|5.0|When it comes to cinema, no man is more synonymous with excellent film scores than John Williams.  This is a mammoth collection of great literature of this genre.  There are the well known Williams pieces and some lesser known gems.  So then, why not 5 stars?  The performancs in most cases, do not live up to the original soundtrack performances.  But, to have this many pieces in one collection so as not to have to buy each soundtrack is priceless!
6300184080|5.0|This is a movie that everyone should see. It has excellent performances by Cher, Eric Stoltz and Sam Elliot. Its about a boy with facial deformities and how he has to struggle with his disease, as well as the regular trials and tribulations of adolescence. It's really powerful and portrays things in a very realistic light....love, friendship, family, discrimination and bullying. For example the real feelings and emotions Rocky has and how even though his mom loves and protects him, she isn't perfect either. The movie focuses on making the best out of the hand life deals you, with drive and determination and the support of your friends and family.... Watch this movie, it is very powerful and moving.
B000002C1W|4.0|I must admit that until I read this review, I had no idea that so many people actually did not like this album. I have been innocently enjoying this album for many years now. What is the typical Pink Floyd music that people keep talking about? How are any of the Floyd albums musically related in any case? The band has gone through so many changes anyway. The only trademark that I can really associate with PF music is psychedelia. And there too, I do not find Another brick in the wall, really a trademark PF song, comparable to comfortably numb or take it back. Time, money are also very normal songs, which do not really *fit* PF, really speaking except for weird sounds. And yet, each of these songs are brilliant.<br />Coming to the tracks, I think the start with Signs of Life is brilliant and very appropriately long (or should I say, short). Learning to fly was the first song of this album that I liked. Dogs of War is brilliant and experimental. It takes time to grow on you, but you will really really love it after sometime. One Slip and On the turning away are grreat songs, especially one slip if you talk about the flow. In side B, I in fact like the New Machine songs. I think they are very unique kind of tunes, very very experimental. Terminal frost is below average and long, so you can skip it. The album ends decently with sorrow. Sorrow is a good song again. Believe me, you will find many good songs in this album.<br />In one sentence, what I like in this album are the experiments.
1573225517|4.0|I'll have to admit that I found 'High Fidelity' boring and without nerve at first. But anyway I kept on reading because - well what the heck, I had bought the book in an airport to keep me busy on the plane so my demands weren't exactly high.<br />And then a funny thing happened. I seemed to be more and more moved and excited by the novel. And before long I was caught. I simply could not put down the book until the last page had been flipped.<br />'High Fidelity' is very down to Earth and realistic (which is characteristic for all of Hornby's novels and short stories). And maybe that's why the book can seem boring and without nerve at first. But the boringness is really what makes the book exciting! Although this seems weird, I have a perfectly good explanation for it. Usually novels are filled with high-flying drama and are not that realistic. At least not for all of us (a novel like American Psycho is of course realistic for a few serial killers but for the rest of us it's really far out). But in 'High Fidelity' we all, or most of us at least, can relate to one of the main characters and say: &quot;this could might as well have been me&quot;. That is the really intriguing part of 'High Fidelity'.<br />And for anyone who likes classic rock 'High Fidelity' is a must. The book is packed with little anecdotes and stories that will only be recognized by those with quite some knowledge of classic rock.<br />If you think life itself is interesting then go get 'High Fidelity'. If you, on the other hand, like to get away from everyday life then stay out of the way from this book. You'll might get a serious depression out of it.
0783114222|5.0|What makes this one of the best programs ever to watch on your DVD: <br /> - Facts are real, has plenty of information about what probably is humankind`s greatest achievement. The mix of real footage and amazingly created ones add to  its real life/documentary spirit. But it`s far from being a documentary, although every fact is real. It goes beyond on the narration. <br /> - It`s not \\"Americana\\" on its spirit. Mr. Hanks and his team deserve merits for showing this great achievement as a mankind victory instead of an \\"America only\\" feat. Congratulations! <br /> - Each episode is presented thru an original point of view, not the one you`d expect. This gives new life to the facts. The Apollo 13 episode, for example, shows how an anchor man from a TV network faced his drama at the same time as the astronauts. A great achievement since if it was presented the other way it would fail when compared to the movie. Actually, one complements the other. <br />  - Many generations have not lived the man on the moon. This is the best way to give them a small feeling of what that meant. It`s the closest an historical document can  get to emotion. Anyone will learn great and funny facts from the Apollo project and  its missions. <br /> - Episodes are very successful in passing the feeling of this great achievement.  You`ll be proud of it, specially if you happened to be alive when it happened. At the  end you`ll regret the fact that today we (humans/nations) spend too much time and energy with small problems that don`t take anyone anywhere. <br /> - On the latest episode you`ll learn that one of the century`s \\"greatest\\" men was, actually, the first pirate whose actions [messed with] the life of the first great filmmaker. <br /> - Mr. Hanks talents go far beyond acting. Congratulations! <br /> - Acting is amazing, direction perfect, screenplays compelling. You won`t believe this was \\"just\\" a 12 episode TV miniseries. It`s FAR better than many movies made on science fiction/space exploration genres. <br /> The only point where they`ve sleeped: <br /> - The box and its opening \\"book\\" scheme doesn`t feel it`ll be up to date when man reaches Mars. <br /> I`d like to remind you all that this is not a science fiction miniseries. Its focus is on the spirit, the challenge, the emotions, the technology, the men and women involved on taking the man on a voyage from the Earth to the Moon. <br />    it`s far from cheap. But worth every cent.
B000003BZ4|5.0|These guys have it all.  Any fan of southern rock should check these guys out.  Heck, any fan of rock should give these guys a listen.  Amazing song writing fills this entire cd.  Monkey Hill, Painted Silver Light, and Mr. Big are my favorites.  Mother Earth also rocks, and the jazzy madness of Trane is quite impressive.  Buy this cd.  Now.
B0000060NF|5.0|At the end of the CD there is a quiet refrain of \\"What's Going On?\\", where Marvin sings, \\"Brother, Brother, everybody thinks we're wrong...\\"...and...I always have a tear in my eye...the sadness and the beauty. \\"What's Going On?\\" is simply the best R&B album ever recorded!!...and really, few have come close to it in thirty years (maybe Stevie Wonder's \\"Innervisions\\"). Several years ago I hoped we'd be surprised by some artist who'd take a chance and produce something that pulled us all together and spoke to the ills and tensions of today's society. I wanted Keith Sweat to do it....he has the instrument, his beseeching voice (not pleading, not begging)...but he got rich and comfortable. Too many artists are comfortable...too many bling, bling videos with mansions and expensive cars.  I believe we will get that album for the new generation...WE WILL!! ...we NEED it soon...we NEED it NOW!! I look to Lauryn Hill to bring that album now...she has it in her. I will wait patiently.
B00000J8EK|4.0|This is a great album, but every album has its flaws.  The first two or three tracks i find kind of anoying because they are very laser gun style and sound like they came from the late 80s.  After those tracks are done, the album is great. Tthe rest of the tracks are nice.  They range from slight trance to a splash of rock.  It is a great all around album that is going to put you in a good mood and put a smile on your face.
6305657939|5.0|This film has it all.  Beautiful clothes (all by Michael Kors, for the fashion conscious), fantastic locations, romance, action, suspense and the sexsiest love sceen of all time.  Stars the two most perfect specimens (and the only two who could pull of these very slick roles), Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan.  The dialogue is fantastic and totally sexy.  There is no other film like this and there is no other man like Thomas Crown.  The soundtrack is equally as perfect with Nina Simone, Wasis Diop and the very sensual and sexy Sting performing &quot;Windmills of Your Mind&quot;.  Absolute perfection.

B. White, November 1929<br />As the poem Natural History, written some 23 years before Charlotte's Web indicates, EB White had a long fascination with spiders and their webs and the truth to be discerned in them.  In fact, he was enamored of the natural world in general and his desire to be closer to the land led him to move to a Maine farm in 1939.  It was in the farm life and specifically in the comfort of the barn that the inspiration for this children's classic came to him :<br />  As for Charlotte's Web, I like animals and my barn is a very pleasant place to be, at all hours. One<br />  day when I was on my way to feed the pig, I began feeling sorry for the pig because, like most<br />  pigs, he was doomed to die. This made me sad. So I started thinking of ways to save a pig's life. I<br />  had been watching a big grey spider at her work and was impressed by how clever she was at<br />  weaving. Gradually I worked the spider into the story that you know, a story of friendship and<br />  salvation on a farm.<br />From these humble beginnings he wove an enduring tale of love and loyalty, life and death, and, perhaps unnoticed by most of us until adulthood, of the comic ingenuousness of man, and of the value of knowledge and a big vocabulary.<br />White, renowned as an essayist, wrote so clearly and fluidly that the pages whiz by.  And if you get a chance to listen to the audio version that he reads himself, it is the performance of a master storyteller.  Though a native New Yorker (Mt. Vernon anyway), White had by then picked up the rhythm and accents of a New Englander.  In addition, he tells the story with apparent affection for his creations, love of the barnyard, and amusement at the goings on.<br />I was trying to figure out what made it all so magical and then I found this quote in which he described his own work (What Am I Saying To My Readers He ?, May 14, 1961, NY Times) :<br />  What am I saying to my readers? Well, I never know. Writing to me is not an exercise in addressing<br />  readers, it is more as though I were talking to myself while shaving. My foray into the field of<br />  children's literature was an accident, and although I do not mean to suggest that I spun my two<br />  yarns in perfect innocence and that I did not set about writing &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; deliberately,<br />  nevertheless, the thing started innocently enough, and I kept on because I found it was fun. It also<br />  became rewarding in other ways--and that was a surprise, as I am not essentially a storyteller and<br />  was taking a holiday from my regular work.<br />  All that I ever hope to say in books is that I love the world. I guess you can find that in there, if<br />  you dig around. Animals are part of my world and I try to report them faithfully and with respect.<br />He succeeded quite brilliantly in the task he set himself.  I know of no work of literature by any author that better expresses respect for animals and love for the world.<br />GRADE : A+wned as an essayist, wrote so clearly and fluidly that the pages whiz by.

B000002H33|5.0|This is a Metallica album from the good old days, when they knew how to write great rock songs; when they didn't write in web site &quot;if you think Metallica is a sell-out, fu....of...&quot;. ANyway, let's stick to this album. It has very great trash metal tunes, altough for mw it was clear that Metallica always copied the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and gave it a disguised form. All the tunes here are killers.
B0000508U6|5.0|I have written many published reviews over the years, and I <br />would have to say that this album ranks right up there with the <br />greats. It is genuine and heartfelt and give music hope for the <br />future. It is its own genre and deserves to be treated as such. <br />It is the best album of the year by far, the next closest album <br />being No Name Face. If Coldplay can follow up this with another <br />stellar product, they could surpass Oasis as the greatest band <br />of the last 20 years.

There's nobody like him, and you can bet there never will be again. Thanks for the ride, Bob.
B000002UB6|5.0|You all know the history to this little gem; so I won't go into that.Some people think LET IT BE is too unpolished and raw in some places,overpolished in others.To me the last released Beatles album is that wild,unpredictable Beatles jam session that we always wanted to sit in on.We also have the sparce(for him)Phil Spector prescence,touching up a few of the bare tunes with sweeteners that never fail to entice.It's a pity that Ringo did not have any tracks to himself on this album,but them's the breaks.To quote John Lennon,\\"When I heard it,I didn't puke\\"<BR>(although Paul apparently did).<br />TWO OF US - Straight after digging a pygmy,we have the country rock duo of Lennon and McCartney.The lyrics sum up their friendship in a direct,yet precise way.The dual harmonies are spellbinding.Fades off into:<br />DIG A PONY - Rolling rocker with hard chords and that unique Lennon wordplay.\\"Dig a Moondog\\" is a sly reference to one of the names the Beatles went under in their pre-Hamburg days,Johnnie And The Moondogs.Great screaming backup vocals from McCartney.<br />ACROSS THE UNIVERSE - A Lennon discard dating back from India;attempted several times unsucessfully,and given to a wildlife conservation appeal album(called \\"Nothing's Gonna Change Our World\\").Spector unearthed it and put female backup singers and bird soundeffects into the mix.A spiritual lyric and vocal;John sounds at peace with himself.<br />I ME MINE - George Harrison's comment on Apple Board meetings. Part ballad,part rocker;all memorable. <br />DIG IT - An informal jam session captured on tape.Billy Preston rolls in on keyboard,and John keeps playing the word association game.Apparently,there is a much longer version of this in the vaults;I for one want to hear it.<br />LET IT BE - After a mocking aside from John,we have Paul's hymn to his long departed mother.The Spector-added choir turn this track into an almost religious experience.George adds some guts to the gospel(so to speak)with an emotionally charged guitar solo.<br />MAGGIE MAE - The boys jam on a traditional Liverpool sea ditty about a \\"scrubber\\". Wish it was longer. <br />I'VE GOT A FEELING - Two ideas mixed into one;typical McCartney screamer combined with Lennon wordplay.<br />ONE AFTER 909 - Unusual rockabilly treatment of a pre-Hamburg Lennon/McCartney effort;this track was attempted in 1963,but not released.The boys sound energised on this track. <br />THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD - The version that made Paul see red.<br />An unassuming,flat ballad when first recorded;Spector added orchestra and choir to make this timeless.Unfortunately,<BR>McCartney was not consulted on the changes;the rest they say is history.<br />FOR YOU BLUE - George \\"gets loose' on this jaunty,bouncing bluesy number.Check out his \\"Elmore James\\" quip in the middle of the song.LOL! <br />GET BACK - Or is it the story of sweet Loretta Phart who thought she was a tailor?Unforgettable Beatles rocker with playful keyboard solo by Billy Preston and a classic Lennon \\"thankyou\\" to wrap up the loose ends and the show.
B0000025VU|3.0|Dylan developed a quirky reputation in the 80s for sabotaging his records with astonishingly mediocre songs, while leaving superior ones in the can. The release of &quot;Bootleg Series Vols. 1 - 3&quot; reveals what a superb album &quot;Infidels&quot; could have been. I'm surely the ten millionth person complaining about the exclusion of &quot;Blind Willie McTell,&quot; not only one of Dylan's best 80s songs, but one of his best songs ever.<BR>Dylan fans agree that he released many bad songs in the 80s. Oddly, based on my reading of &quot;Infidels&quot; reviews, I find it apparent that no one can agree on what the bad songs are. Personally, I think &quot;Man of Peace&quot; and &quot;Neighborhood Bully&quot; are terrific songs, but I seem to be in the minority. &quot;License to Kill&quot; and &quot;Union Sundown&quot; do nothing for me, and again, I seem to be in the minority. &quot;Jokerman,&quot; of course, is a classic.<BR>Other lamented exclusions from &quot;Infidels&quot;: &quot;Foot of Pride&quot; and &quot;Tell Me.&quot; If the following had been the contents of &quot;Infidels,&quot; I would rate it five stars and regard it as one of Dylan's best albums:<BR>Jokerman<BR>Tell Me<BR>Neighborhood Bully<BR>Blind Willie McTell<BR>Man of Peace<BR>Foot of Pride<BR>Lord, Protect My Child<BR>Someone's Got a Hold of My Heart
0743201140|4.0|Buy the book!  A code found on the book jacket that lets you take the StrengthsFinder insturment, and print out the results and supporting documentation is worth the price of the book.<br />As you read through the interpretation material, you will discover a bias in the research with which you may agree or disagree.  I had both feelings simultaneously.  The StrengthsFinder was incredibly accurate for me personally.  However, being a professional survey, questionnaire, and inventory taker, I found that I could guess the answers that fit my self-perception.<br />I highly regard a complex way of considering human personality that allows for a deep level of individuality.  This complex way looks at gifts, skills, and preferences. Therefore, I find that-like all instruments-the StrengthsFinder is inadequate alone for making holistic life decisions.<br />Even so, finding your strengths can mean finding lasting satistfaction in your field.  So this book, the instrument, and the interpretation of each strength will help you focus yourself.<br />I also found helpful a section that talked about how to have a strengths-focused organization.
B00005LW7R|5.0|The long awaited collaboration of Terfel and Abbado in a recording of Falstaff has finally been realized.  The recording demonstrates the depth of perception Terfel has achieved in this role following his performances at the Salzburg Festival.  With Thomas Hampson as Ford, the interaction between soloists and conductor brings endless illumination.  The quality in all departments of the Berlin Philharmonic provides continuous pleasure.  The only thing that bothers me in this set is how Anthony Mee uses English vowels in his Italian.  But it must be said, with the recording industry in a decline, that this is a remarkable achievement and in my opinion the most generous contribution on record to mark the centenary of Verdi's death.
B00005NW02|4.0|This album is just amazing. System of a Down are definately a band we are going to hear a lot about in the not so distant future. Toxicity is quite different to their self titled debut, the music and vocals are much better, this is definately a band whom has musically matured.<BR>     This is a very strong album, Serj Tankians lyrics are good but it is his vocal style which captures my attention. These songs are suprisingly catchy and Serj's range shines out, the guitar and drum work are commendable as well.<BR>     This album is definately worth picking up. The strongest tracks are &quot;Prison Song&quot;, &quot;Forest&quot; and &quot;Chop Suey&quot;. The only weak track is &quot;Jet Pilot&quot; which really is why i did not give this album 5 stars.<BR>     System of a Down are definately on an up.
B00003CXWV|5.0|If you want to see a movie about the drug scene go see Blow. This movie should have gotten all the rewards instead of Traffic. [....] It's a true story and it shows how marijuana and cocaine gets into this country. From the growers, drug trafficers and then the distributors. The only thing that disappointed me was Penelope Cruz. She's a beautiful lady but she's that great of an actress. But I strongly recommend this movie if you want to know how the drug trade works.
0385493622|5.0|Okay, maybe not precisely like a Grisham novel, but this is an exciting book, with lots of drama and lots of insight into the people in it. The book isn't math. It's rather more like Dava Sobel's &quot;Longitude&quot;--just a fascinating story about an incredibly difficult problem and the kinds of genius and hard work it took to solve it.<br />If you like books about people who achieve the impossible, you'll love this book.

B00005NWM3|5.0|This is the bands second album titled \\"Silver Side Up\\" This is one of my favorite cds. If you liked the songs \\"Leader of Men, and \\"Breathe\\" you will love this cd. You probably heard the song \\"How You Remind Me\\" and the cd is full of songs like that. My favorites are How You Remind Me, Never Again, Woke Up this Morning and Hangnail. Nickelback is far better than some of the poser stuff on the radio. So go buy this album...
B0000241WA|5.0|You can certainly be forgiven for not expecting much of this collaboration between the Hamlet-like founding Byrd member and the smart Texas cowpunk/new wave chick. But have faith and buy!<br />Gene Clark and Carla Olson put together a fine dozen songs consisting of a few by each of them and wonderful selections from other writers (Gram Parsons' &quot;Hot Burrito No.1&quot;, John Fogerty's &quot;Almost Saturday Night,&quot; Joe South's &quot;Don't It Make You Wanta Go Home&quot; and Woody Guthrie's forever relevant &quot;Deportee&quot;). Their two voices mix wonderfully, Clark's soulful world-weary plaint and Olson's throaty contralto complementing each other. The instrumentation is a scintillating all-acoustic platform that makes me wish more people made records without amplifiers. This album will never date.<br />The only complaint for this release is a greedy one: I wish they had done more than twelve tracks.

B00005NI5Y|4.0|If you listen to the critics, you might be disappointed with \\"Love and Theft.\\"  THAT word, \\"masterpiece,\\" is being tossed around a bit too freely, as it often is when Dylan releases an album that demonstrates some ambition. A new disc from ol' Bob is almost always a masterpiece compared to the bilge emerging from most CDs these days, but only time will tell how high a position \\"Love and Theft\\" will claim in Dylan's tower of song.<br />The track most likely to find its way onto the next greatest hits album is \\"Mississipi,\\" a song left-off \\"Time Out of Mind\\" when Dylan didn't see eye-to-eye with producer Daniel Lanois on how it should be presented. There were no such disagreements this time around since Dylan produced himself (under the pseudonym of Jack Frost). But every song on this set has something delightful to offer. I like \\"Sugar Baby\\" the best.<br />\\"Love and Theft\\" is an unquestionalby strong, immensely entertaining, and sometimes hilarious collection of new songs, a very worthy addition to the man's catalogue and a testament to his talent at the ripe old age of 60. It's good, solid Dylan.

6304359217|4.0|Air Jordan and the Heckling Hare? Couldn't work.....could it? Leave your cynicism about merchaindaising at the door, because Space Jam accomplishes something that The Flintstones Meets The Jetsons, or other such fare, could never achieve. First, for such a goofy concept, the film is remarkably grounded in reality, and some of the best scenes are about victimized NBA players dealing with no talents; add to that the implications of Jordan's experience with the Looneys affecting his chosen sport. Performances are dead-on, and Michael is as properly laconic an actor as he is a player. Finally, the key to this is the Looney Tunes themselves - it's their first foray into true feature films. Thankfully, each character (especially Bugs and Daffy, and those two ought to be) are complete in character as they were in the 40s and 50s. Seeing Bugs get equal billing as the live-action star is beyond promising; it's a reminder that Bugs Bunny has possibly meant more to Americans than a great deal of actors, writers, and directors combined. People will pass on, but the &quot;mild-mannered forest creature&quot;, as he himself would put it, will live on into eternity.
6304383827|4.0|This movie ranks among my all-time favorite movies.  It's a wonderful adaption of the Jane Austen's novel.  Gwyneth Paltrow is delightful as the title character, not to mention the great acting by Jeremy Northam and Toni Collete.  I fell completely in love with Jeremy Northam's Mr. Knightley after watching the movie.  :)<br />Having watched both the Paltrow version and the A&amp;E version of the novel, I have to say that i enjoyed this version a lot more.  The Paltrow version captures the light-hearted atmosphere and humor of the novel far better than the A&amp;E version.  Also, I liked Northam's more sympathetic Mr. Knightley in comparison to Mark Strong's stern approach to his character. <br />My only bone to pick with the Paltrow version is how the director treated the Jane Fairfax/Frankchurchill subplot.  It seemed like there wasn't enough time to include a more drawn-out story.  The A&amp;E version did a much better job with it.

B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd started out as the leaders of the London underground movement and from there progressed musically with the technology surrounding them.<br /> After two psychedelic albums, they settled into more dreamy sound scopes, so after a further five albums, they produced \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\". This, in many ways, set the example for a lot of the bands that followed. Great material, excellent production and fine musicianship.<br /> The basic theme of \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" is about the stresses and strains of everyday life. Roger Waters later came up with the idea of expressing the fears of ordinary people and how these drive people mad. In other words, Roger Waters wrote this while he was just mad, not mad at the world for being a World War 2 baby, which he has since become obsessive about in his later work. The Dark Side refers to what goes on inside people heads, the subconscious and the unknown. Recurring lyrical themes were used, such as mortality, madness, war, greed, stress and loneliness.<br /> \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" had been performed in the Pink Floyd live set for more than a year when they went into Abbey Road studios to record, with Alan Parsons as the Engineer.<br /> The band had met in a rehearsal studio in London in November 1971 and began working on music for their next album. Over the course of the next two months, they wrote and rehearsed various musical ideas including bits and pieces that the band had written in the past. These included such songs as \\"Breathe\\", from the \\"Music From The Body\\" album (1970), \\"The Violent Sequence\\" that was written and recorded for the \\"Zabriskie Point\\" soundtrack (1971) which became \\"Us &amp; Them\\", and \\"Brain Damage\\" from a demo Waters had recorded whilst writing for the previous years \\"Meddle\\" album.<br /> In the beginning, the songs were in no particular order. Roger Waters later came up with the idea of linking the pieces through a central lyrical theme, so once it was all cobbled together it was played in public in its live format in January, 1972 at the Brighton Dome, England. It was then released to the rest of the world in its studio recorded version in March 1973. Sales by 2000 had passed the 45 million mark and it had been a number one almost everywhere in the world, incredibly not though in their mother county the U.K where it was kept off the number one spot by \\"20 Flash Back hits of the sixties\\" of all things. The album stayed on the Billboards top 200 for a stunning 741 weeks.<br /> The C.D returned to the charts in 1991 after Billboard instituted it's pop catalogue category where it went straight to number one and stayed on that chart for over seven years. So, not a bad little earner then.<br /> The music has became the eternal soundtrack to student bed-sit land, the sound is lush and multi-layered whilst remaining clear and well structured. A fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not invites, but demands involvement in the excellence of it's superb performance. The sound effects on songs like \\"On The Run\\", \\"Time\\" and \\"Money\\" (with sampled sounds of clinking coins and cash registers turning into a rhythmic accompaniment) are especially impressive, especially if we remember that 1973 was before the advent of digital recording techniques. This is probably Pink Floyd's best known work and it's an excellent place to start any C.D collection. However, if you are feeling particularly flush then get Pink Floyd's Live double C.D \\"Pulse\\", where the band (without Waters) lay down a definitive live version of \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" along with another hour and a half's worth of Floyd's best known work.<br />Mott the Dog.ts live format in January, 1972 at the Brighton Dome, England.

0736041850|5.0|This is a MUST for all those involved in strength/weight training. This book will become a major cornerstone/reference in anyone's library, as it has already in mine. The book has all the major exercises for each body part covered [from squats, bench press to dumbell rows]in great detail, shows how to do them correctly and also shows all muscles used for each movement in full anatomical pictures. This book by far exceeded my expectations and is another solid published book by Human Kinetics! I HIGHLY reccomend this book!!!!!!!!
B00003CXZ1|1.0|Yes, though the beautful Angelina Jolie romps through most of the film in skin tight tops staying true to the Lara Croft of Tomb Raider video game fame (with the exception of a wholly unnecessary shower scene), it's not nearly enough to save this horrid mass of dreck. Even the incredible special effects are wasted in a hodge-podge of slice-n-dice editing that makes it impossible for all but those with ADD to follow. The story is senseless and the ending hokey as it comes...<br />Don't waste the money unless you are a die hard fan of the game or Mrs Billy Bob...and really not even then!
B00005NZBN|4.0|A wonderful work, Love and Theft lets us continue to watch the ever-changing faces and roles Dylan has played throughout his career, and as such is a marvelous insight into this dangerous character. He seems to move effortlessly through any musical syle he selects, and the band is like a fist. Check out Mississippi, Lonesome Day Blues, High Water and Sugar Baby especially; all classic Dylan &quot;keepers&quot; in my view. Another milestone.
B00005NW02|5.0|Ever since the first time I heard Chop Suey! I couldn't wait to get this cd.  It's 15 tracks if you include the bonus track and it's around 45 minutes long.  Toxicity starts off with one of the best tracks on the cd, &quot;Prison Song.&quot;  I love this song and it has pretty cool lyrics.  &quot;Needles&quot; is definately one of their heaviest songs ever.  &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; is their first single off of Toxicity.  If I were S.O.A.D.  I'd make ATWA or Prison song the next single.  Another sweet track is Psycho, in which Serj chants, 'Psycho, groupie, cocaine crazy....'  Also, check out the bonus disk.  Pretty cool stuff.  The only reason this cd is considered explicit is probably the bonus disk and several drug referances.  Buy toxicity now.<br />dj ozell
B00005NW02|4.0|There were two much-anticipated metal releases this year; one, Slipknot's Iowa, came close to surpassing the potential of their debut, but System Of A Down's uneven, but energetic and smouldering new album (produced by the great Rick Rubin), Toxicity, elevates the Armenian-American quartet to among the elite in hard rock today. No other metal band today is so adept at combining the aggression of aggro, unique melodies, and political consciousness as these guys.<BR>At their best, SOAD sound like the best rock band on the planet. 'Needles' features the best fast-fingered riffs this side of Slayer, while the phenomenal 'Deer Dance' puts a demented Middle Eastern twist on the grinding guitar rhythms Anthrax perfected fifteen years ago. 'Jet Pilot' is just plain exciting, two insane minutes of severe energy. Best of all are the spectacular 'Chop Suey' and 'Aerials', whose combinations of time changes and harmonies show auch an an intense band is capable of showing some soul without reverting to the pathetic whining that pervades nu-metal these days. Serj Tankian's powerful singing of &quot;father why have you forsaken me&quot; in the awesome bridge in 'Chop Suey' is thrilling to hear.<BR>Toxixity would have been awfully close to perfect if it weren't for a few songs that threaten to bring the entire album back into the realm of the sophomoric. 'Bounce', 'Shimmy', and 'Psycho', though musically as enthralling as the rest, are thematically stupid, sounding nothing more than frat-boy rants, and completely clash with the intelligence shown in the other twelve songs.<BR>The real star of the album is the vocal talent of Tankian. There is no other hard rock vocalist as talented as he right now, a singer capable of screaming like Tom Araya, growling like Corey Taylor, ranting like Jello Biafra, and belting out the notes like Bruce Dickinson...all in the same song. He actually makes the huge line &quot;All research and successful drug policy show that treatment should be increased and law enforcement decreased while abolishing mandatory minimum sentences&quot; fit into a song without losing a breath. His lyrics can be a bit pretentious (&quot;self-righteous suicide&quot;? Come on...), but I'll take a bit of pretentiousness over banality any day.<BR>With Toxicity, SOAD comes very close to reaching new heights in heavy music, and this is only their second album. Their musical potential is staggering, and they should only get better.
0446604844|3.0|I have been a fan of David Baldacci for the past two years.  I enjoy reading his books normally.  For some reason I felt like I was never going to finish the book and then I felt let down with the ending.  After following the trail across the country I guess I was hoping for a happier ending.
0800141660|4.0|Pre-Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon Ang Lee-directed film based on a Jane Austen novel. Like all Jane Austen adaptations, this is a period piece usually with a great deal to say about society and love. Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson are both more than appealing in their roles as the main characters. Winslet is the hopeless romantic, always getting her heart stolen and broken and coming ever so near the heroine's last breath, while her sister, played flawlessly by Thompson, is the older, more mature and settled one who tries her best to keep Winslet grounded. The book is full, like other Austen books, of misunderstandings and missed opportunities for love, and Ang Lee brings a beautiful sensitivity to the nuances of these relationships, which, in less capable hands, could come across in a crass and altogether unappealing fashion. Also stars Hugh Grant. ...
6303142257|1.0|This has got to be the dumbest movie I have ever seen!  Such a dissapointment coming from Disney!  There is no plot to the movie and it doesn't keep the children's attention.  It teaches no lessons other than to be mean (the queen of hearts).  I cannot stand this movie and it will NEVER be in my house!
6305308659|3.0|The always brilliant Tobey Maguire (who will soon skyrocket to superstardom with his starring role in the upcoming Spiderman) stars with the talented Reese Witherspoon in this entertaining family drama about a brother and sister who are somehow transported into a 1950s television show. The film begins with Witherspoon as an airheaded, shallow popular girl with absolutely no interest in college or much of anything beyond sex, fashion and talking on the phone. Maguire, as her brother, is a semi-geeky kid who is obsessed with a 50s sitcom set in idyllic Pleasantville. As he is preparing to watch a marathon of the show, he and his sister get into a fight about what to watch and somehow end up breaking the remote control. Don Knotts plays a strange tv repairman who gives them a remote control that zaps them both into the 1950s. When they first arrive in this idyllic tv world, Witherspoons character is haughty and angry, while Maguire really loves this new world. As time passes, and they have to integrate themselves into the tv world, they find that they change it and turn it from black and white into colour. The film is a clever concept, the acting is lovely, and the changes the characters go through in their odyssey through 1950s tv family idealism are interesting. Joan Allen, William H. Macy, and the late JT Walsh also star.
B00005K3OT|4.0|This appetizing romantic comedy features little romance and little comedy. Yet it's entertaining, the acting is good, and it co-stars the most mouth-watering confections since C.S. Lewis's mythical rooms of Turkish Delight. I would recommend renting this film before purchasing, but to be honest, I can't really think of a reason why you as a viewer would be displeased with this one.
B00005NWM3|5.0|It sounds pretty good so far, a little repetitiveness in the hooks and riffs, but hey, even perfection has it's flaws. The song &quot;Woke up this Morning&quot; is a perfect descrition of what's goin on in the U.S. right now...I feel depressed now. Get the album, DL the track, whatever! Just hear it and pray for those in the towers and those who will feel our military -and global- might.
B00005LQ04|4.0|I had no idea what to expect from this movie, but I've been interested in several Dario Argento films.  If you can afford it, get the 3-disc limited set.<br />The BIG BONUS is the CD soundtrack of Goblin's music!  I love it.  The clarity is so superior and I just love the music; Goblin plays a variety of mood music from frantic, tension, wild horror, to a gentle piano piece for a ballet scene.  <br />Yes, the ending is a bit quick.  But the first 10 minutes and the final ten minutes (just prior to the ending) will knock your socks off!  Extreme quality picture and sound, although the CD soundtrack (3rd disc) has the greatest clarity.  You must live in a place where you can blast the music throughout your whole house.  It is not meant to be played at low volumes.  Treat yourself to a wild, terrifying audio experience.

B00000G6QK|1.0|This is by far the funkiest and tastiest live jazz fusion funk record ever recorded. This album was conceived(mid 70's) at a time when truly creative music was very much appreciated, unlike today. There is more substance in this record than I have space to elaborate on here. And there is not one funkless bone in this band. This will be a well appreciated addition to any true music lovers collection.<br />Peace &amp; Happy Funking
B00005A46T|5.0|I have been a hardcore Slipknot fan since their first CD came out. Their first CD was the best metal CD ever recorded. Hands down.  Iowa is a great CD I think it is as good if not better that the first. The vocals from frontman #8 rock.  His voice is always screeching, growling, singing and just producing sick sounds.  Along with his two awsome guitarists (#7,#4) thrashing away and all three drummers (two percussionists) playing three different beats, it just forms insane souonds that will blow your mind.  If your a metal fan, buy this CD. <br />3:

B00003CXMG|5.0|Cameron Crowe really outdoes himself here, and clearly uses some of his own personal experiences and observations to create what is one of the best movies of 2000. <BR>It has a young-boy-finding-himself appeal, rather like a 1970's 'Perks of being a Wallflower', yet the characters are exceptionally developed and appealing, especially the divine Miss Pennylane, a groupie come professional band aid.<BR>The plot has a handsome gentle humour and a fabulous way of ordering scenes to maximise the effect of the piece. I adored the phone call and reply 'Has the acid kicked in yet?' and reply, 'How can you tell?' followed by the immediate shot of Russell on the top of a house screaming 'I am on drugs'.<BR>The director delivers a sensitivity to the film and the characters, and reveals beauty admist the drug culture and ideas<BR>of the 1960's and 1970's. Of particular note was the scene in which the bus sings Elton's classic 'Tiny Dancer' and the aeroplane scene in which members of the band admit their mutual dislike, love and homosexuality. As well as Pennylane's reply 'What kind of beer?' when it is revealed she is traded for $50 and a case of beer. But then, the brillance never ends in this film.<br />This film is truly fabulous, reminding us what we love about music, and what we love about life. I only wish I had been there.
B00005LKHW|5.0|This is one great movie. It is literaly made for everyone; comedy for people who want to laugh, romance for people who want to feel for the characters, nudity for the guys..., and a lesson for the parents. A great cast, story, and funny moments to make this movie a part of your DVD library.
B000002GFC|3.0|I bought this for convenience rather than playing my vinyl copies of Disraeli Gears and Wheels of Fire. Big mistake as the bottom end of the scale is mostly missing. It is difficult to hear Baker work his magic. Keep your vinyl or buy the box set as the remaster quality is apparently better.
B00005NZBN|4.0|They couldn't have put the bonus tracks on the first CD?  And if they really felt they didn't belong there with the new music, they could have put a little more on the second CD.  Dylan recorded many \\"alternate\\" versions of his songs, & his vaults are overflowing.  What a waste of a CD.  Just get the normal version of Love & Theft and download the two bonus songs of a Napster-like service such as Morpheus, LimeWire or WinMX (unless it is illegal to do so in your area...).<br />Love & Theft is a very good album,....
B00003CXZ3|5.0|I just have to say that this is the best movie I've seen since The Usual Suspects. Everything about this movie is good - the editing is completely awesome because the scene progression puts you precisely in the mindset of Leonard, and the acting is great. The plot is decent, but how it is presented is absolutely phenomenal. If you pay more attention to the movie, you get more out of it because you know exactly what happened at the end. The story is airtight, and although I've seen it four times, I can only barely grasp the full scope of the movie. Excellent - I hope it's represented at the Oscars this year.
0380973650|5.0|If you've read Gaiman's work before, you will recognise many of the themes in this book.  Everything about the nature of Gods -- what they are, where they come from, how they survive, and what happens when they don't -- seems to be of supreme interest to him.  As well, he is often concerned with the relationships between &quot;common&quot; mortals and the &quot;uncommon&quot; (deity, supernatural forces, etc.)and how that relationship changes a person.<br />Gaiman certainly has the background knowledge to explore these topics!  In fact, much of his work seems to contain less truly original content than it does beautifully arranged and applied folk traditions and mythologies.  But to Gaiman, it seems that everything is a mythology, from tales of the Norse Pantheon to serial killers and black helicopters.  Myself, I see the world that way too, so it's validating to read someone else who does.  People who don't see the world that way, however, can find Gaiman's work long-winded and irrelevant.<br />Gaiman's use of language is one the strongest points of this novel.  He uses no more words than necessary, yet combines them in exquisite pictures like &quot;Chicago came on slowly, like a migraine.&quot;  Having read _American Gods_ following a cheesy and bombastic fantasy novel, I was really refreshed!<br />I also really liked that much of the book was set in small towns and out of the way places.  Living in a small town myself, I can say that Gaiman really has a handle on both the charms and oddities of small town America.  It's great to see that given space without being made totally sinister, as King tends to do.<br />Some people have objected to the lack of Christian content in anything with the word &quot;Gods&quot; in it.  Similar objections were made to sections of _The Sandman's_ run.  The only thing I can say to this is, if you're a strict monotheist or a religious fundamentalist of any kind, you will probably not like this book, so don't bother. Ditto if you don't like having your idea of the world challenged, or if you just don't find questions about the nature of deity interesting.t like having your idea of the world challenged, or if you just don't find questions about the nature of deity interesting.
B00005NWM3|4.0|'Silver Side Up' is everything a sophomore release should be: it immediately shows progression in production, musicianship, scope and composition and the confidence gleamed from breaking into the industry shines brightly on every track. Then it also has a few instant hits to announce the band's return, and these serve to hide the sleeper tracks that ensure longevity.<br />From the start it's an onslaught of visceral anger, rejection and just plain adrenaline-induced energy that only let's up as the final seconds of the 50-minute disc winds down to a humorous bluesy jam. I honestly can't pick a favourite track as its very hard to pin one down - not because they're all similar, oh no, but because they're all just so much damn fun. No more just 'that Canadian band with the Kurt Kobain impersonator' Nickelback have gained enough credit in my book to stand above the plethora of bands trying to do the same in this post-grunge-alt-metal era. My only complaint would be that the track's 'How you remind me', 'Too Bad' &amp; 'Just For' first and second parts (split invariably by a bass-filled bridge) are exact copies of each other - in tempo, rhythm and lyrics, only the vocals seem to alter. But this is only nit-picking since I won't complain hearing a fun piece of music twice.<br />I'm dead certain I won't be listening to this album in six months, but for now I enjoy every minute of it.
0140042520|5.0|While &quot;On the Road&quot; remains the quintessential Kerouac, &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; at times reaches even loftier heights of spontaneous prose brilliance.  Simply put, this book is kicking.  It sometimes explodes with lyrical fireworks; other times it slinkily floats with the ease of cool jazz.  A must-read for Beatniks who've discovered Jacky's brilliance, or those just looking for a little literary buzz.
B00005221M|5.0|LOTM is one of my all-time favorite films. While it seems that many people here didn't like the changes made in the DVD Director's edition, I found the changes, for the most part, to have enhanced my enjoyment of the movie. I was most pleased that the Clannad song was dropped from the film as I found it rather distracting. I would have liked to see more deleted scenes and other behind the scenes features. This is by far one of the most accurate portrayals of the French &amp; Indian War period ever made and is filled with action, romance, great battles, and beautiful costumes. I simply had to have this great movie on DVD!
B0000541AM|5.0|This is he best movie ive ever seen
B00005221M|2.0|The director's cut DVD version of The Last of the Mohicans took what was one of the greatest films, a film that seamlessly combined romance, action, and some of the most beautiful cinamatography ever seen, and managed to destroy the flow of the film, change some of the stirring music and drop a few of the movie's best lines and moments all in the name of adding in extra scenes that are, in the end, completely useless. The DVD doesn't even contain the option to view the original version and has very little in the way of &quot;extras&quot; such as behind the scenes footage or interviews with any of the people involved. I am going to have to stick to my VHS version of this fantastic film, and recommend that others skip on splurging for this very disappointing DVD.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Unbelievably, nearly 40 years into his career, with 42 albums already to his credit, and at 60 years of age, Bob Dylan has given us yet another masterpiece. This is a total left turn from his last album, the deeply personal, grieving Time Out of Mind, with its burlesque nature and playful lyrics; much the way as Bob delivered the all-over-the-map Desire after the release of the personal, moving Blood On The Tracks. But Love and Theft is an entirely different animal. The music is indeed an expansion on the standard 12-bar blues theme, but a good portion of it sounds different, almost like early-century lounge music. Songs such as Summer Days and Bye and Bye prove that Dylan's recent cover of Dean Martin's Return To Me was no fluke. He evokes the mood and spirit of this type of music surprisingly well. Few would've thought him capable of it. But we should've learned by now not to underestimate Bob Dylan. Whereas Time Out of Mind was very bleak and world-weary-focusing mostly on mortality and broken love affairs-Love and Theft is more playfully witty, the lyrics evoking a sense of the sly and the sardonic, in a way that has not happened as magically on a Bob Dylan album, since, I dare say, Blonde On Blonde. You can tell that Dylan had fun making this album. And it is as fun to listen to. Tracks such as Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, Lonesome Day Blues, and Floater (Too Much To Ask) showcase this playful side of Dylan. The aforementioned Summer Days and Bye and Bye, as well as Po' Boy showcase the easy-going, pseudo-lounge act side of Dylan. And then there are songs, such as Mississippi (in fact, an outtake from Time Out of Mind; which only shows how great that album was), and the biting closer Sugar Baby showcase the darker, mortality-obsessed side of Dylan that he wore so openly on his sleeve on his last album. This is another album that's destined to be a classic. One of the best albums of the year. A must-own.
B0000027I6|5.0|Nine years ago this CD really put my feelings following the Gulf War in perspective. In light of the terrible terrorist attacks this past Tuesday in NY, DC and Pennsylvania, one should listen to this album to gain some inner understanding and keep a balance between their anger and sorrow. Many of the songs on this album carry very powerful messages about ourselves and really makes us question where our values are truly centered.
630026999X|3.0|In this collaboration with Stephen King, director George Romero assembles a distinguished cast and pays vividly hued homage to the E.C. horror comics of the 1950s. (This film appeared years before the TALES FROM THE CRYPT series.) Five creepy tales are strung together by a framing story involving a young boy being punished by his father for reading the gruesome, titular comic book. &quot;Father's Day&quot; tells the tale of a family patriarch exacting beyond-the-grave revenge on the daughter who murdered him. In &quot;The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill,&quot; a Maine hayseed (King himself in a ridiculously over-the-top performance) is overtaken by a meteor-based plant growth. A cuckolded husband exacts watery revenge on his cheating wife and her lover in &quot;Something to Tide You Over.&quot; A hairy beast in a box is used for nefarious purposes at a university in &quot;The Crate.&quot; Finally, in &quot;They're Creeping Up on You,&quot; a wealthy, arrogant New Yorker with a fear of germs has a disturbing run-in with cockroaches during a blackout. <br />While the stories are a bit brief, the style is appropriate for the anthology format. Romero's use of garish colors to mimic the ink in comic books is visually appealing, preventing the gore on display from being too off-putting. Featuring early appearances by actors such as Ed Harris and Ted Danson, CREEPSHOW is eerie, engaging entertainment. <br />There are so many reasons why I like this film. The length of the film. 120 minutes. That's two hours of horror stories. If you notice lately, any movie that has more than two stories is usually about an hour and a half. Stephen King and George A. Romero on the other hand, were able to put together a two hour film.<br />It's mostly the suspensful scenes, that get you asking, &quot;what if that was me?&quot; Seeing people suffer in this movie, adds a great effect on the audience. Most of the time I could feel the pain they were going through. Like Ted Danson's story, orwhen Ed Harris was under that grave. Stephen King was funny as he acted as a retarded farm boy. <br />If you haven't seen this film, then do so. If you get the same effect I did, then my review should be helpful to you. <br />Oh yeah! if you're one of those guys who like having snacks and pop during a scary movie, then I would suggest you eat up fast before the last story. Trust me on this one!<br />I hope my review was helpful to you!
B000059HCI|5.0|This movie, shocking, riveting, is one of the most incredible performances I have ever seen. Recommended to me by a fellow film-lover, I had no idea what I was in for. The tour through a drug addicts life, and the incredible mirror of the more standard druggie to the pill poppers, ignorant of the incredible weight their habits carry, unwarned by society, will shock and amaze you. Aside from that, the cinematic techniques employed in this film are incredible - long takes at fast speed, super short shots, and walking shots with the character still, the background moving behind them, all expertly placed, filled with meaning, symbolism and power. It will blow your mind - I was just blank for hours after, unable to comprehend the power of what I had just witnessed. I recommend this to anyone who has ever done or thought of doing drugs, as the most powerful possible deterrent (DARE doesn't have anything to compare to this), anyone who is losing their faith in Hollywood's cheesy movies, or anyone who likes movies. Just don't expect to do anything for a while afterwards - your brain will be literally overpowered.

B000059XY3|5.0|This movie was among my top five movies of 1995 and deservedly was the highest grossing films of the year.<br />How people can consider the first two films better than BF is beyond me... I saw the first Batman on video and snickered, Batman Returns put me to sleep.<br />But Batman Forever left me breathless.  I actually ran out and saw it again the following day in the theatres and the audience clapped after viewing it.  Val Kilmer was perfect in this part, I thought that he played Bruce Wayne with enough seriousness without making him look  too self-absorbed .  Whereas Micheal Keaton in the first two films never let me forget for a momment that he was comedic actor.  The exact antithesis of Batman/Bruce Wayne.<br />Batman Forever has a tight plot with good acting and excellent character development.  The actors actually play well to each other. Kilmer and Nicole Kidman have the best chemistry of any movie couple I have seen in a long time. Chris ODonnel was also a great Robin, I think that it was more effective for them to have made him a college aged boy instead of a teenager.  It made him look more believable.  Carey and Tommy Lee Jones did not impress me much (but then again Batmans villains never have).<br />In all this is the kind of film you can watch again and again!

B000002J1H|5.0|Prog never was this beautiful. I was in high school when the record (at that time we use vynil) came out and I recall I literally destroyed it by the number of times I listened to it, with the greatest relief of family and neighbours given the constant extremely loud volume... buy it if you do not already own it.
6301967992|1.0|No plot, no acting skills displayed (except bad ones), poor music, poor photography, and an overall worthless movie from start to finish.<br />This movie is billed as a comedy but fails in every aspect of movie making.  It is not funny.  The plot is non existant, and the music and photography are not just bad, they are awful.  The viewer cannot tell night from day, and the story line doesn't help one decide if it is night or day.  The acting is so bad that it makes a cartoon look good.  The sound is also bad and the dialog is almost impossible to follow.<br />One star is too much for this movie.  Avoid it at all costs.
B00005NW02|5.0|I really doubted the SOAD could top their incredible self-titled debut, but they have...and FAR surpassed expectations.  This album is such an amazing accomplishment of modern metal that I  find myself almost speechless.  Serj Tankian is this generation's Jello Biafra.  His lyrics are pointed, political, and biting.  He does not flich when giving his opinions, whether it be on the state of modern collegiate education (Shimmy) or the overcrowded penitentiary system of the USA (Prison Song).  As a whole work, Toxicity succeeds on EVERY level, the music is raw and hits you like a blast of adrenaline.  The best thing about Toxicity is that it plays as a WHOLE album, something that is extremely rare in today's watered down metal climate.  Every track on this cd is strong, it is UNRELENTING and BRUTAL.  Some of my very favorites are Jet Pilot, Prison Song, Forest, Aerials, and Toxicity.  The song Toxicity anchors the album and is the absolute best thing that SOAD has done so far.  Bringing in Rick Rubin was a great decision because the strengths of SOAD have been maximized(Tankian's ranting, fast and numerous tempo changes, and Dean's heavy riffing) and the weaknesses simply no longer exist.  The track placement on Toxicity is to be commended as well and much credit should go to Rubin.  I never thought I would say this but this album smokes TOOL's LATERALUS by miles (and I'm a huge TOOL fan).  Toxicity will hit you like a scud missile quick and deadly, but the remains will be with you for a lifetime. HiGhLy ReComMeNdEd.
B00005NB8J|5.0|This movie's release has been hexed from the start. When the movie was released on Laser Disk, it had a sound problem that took 3 months to get it replaced. Then when it came out on DVD, it was a straight to DVD transfer, no special features, no enhancment of the quality and it was one movie that was split on both sides of the DVD. If I wanted that, I would have stayed with Laser. I have a copy of this new release, and it has special featuresa, deleted scenes and you can watch it as a directors version. I am very impressed. I am glad they finally gave this movie the attention to detail it deserved. It's fantastic!
B00003CXWV|5.0|There was a time when I didn't like Johnny Depp. I used to steer clear of his films simply because I had a pre-concieved notion in my mind that I wasn't going to enjoy myself watching Johnny Depp. All this changed however after I saw &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;. And once again, I am impressed with Depp's work, this time in the movie Blow. Depp's portrayal of legendary cocaine dealer George Jung is wonderful. He makes Jung such a likeable person that you don't want to see anything bad happen to the guy, even if he is waste deep in cocaine. Another thing I found interesting about this movie was its almost non-existent use of sex and violence. The story itself, of a middle class kid from Massachusetts growing up to be America's number one coke dealer with simple business savvy is so intriguing that it didn't need the usual drug-dealer movie cliches. Killer flick.
B00005J9ZB|5.0|I was a bit skeptical at first due to not knowing what to expect. I had heard great things about this CD but you never know if their tastes are similar to yours. From the moment I turned this CD on, I was hooked. Superior arrangements, superior vocals and superior instrumentation makes for a phenomenal album. You have all the different characters singing throughout the CD, but more importantly, they even sing to each other during nearly all of the songs. They converse. You do not see this often in music. It makes for an experience you will love.<BR>Get this CD. You won't be sorry.
B00005BJPO|5.0|i recently bought this dvd collection and i am very impressed. the footage quality for this dvd collection is much improved over all the other versions of this movie that i have seen from the theater to videotape. the packaging itself is very impressive.<br />the additional dvd that accompanies it includes the &quot;making of akira&quot; documentary that was previously available on videotape. there is also additional material on the making of the music and a glossary of terms and storyboard art. for fans of this excellent example in modern-day animation, the supplemental material provided on this second disc is very in-depth.<br />the only thing about this dvd edition that bothered was the dubbing of the movie. there is a brand new dubbing version made for this particular dvd edition. i, myself, prefer subtitles. it keeps the original language intact and more truer to the story. dubbing usually requires editing the english actors' voices to meet with the lip movements. the voice acting doesn't seem to match the movie but since this is my preference to watching this anime, it should be up to each individual. but you can still choose between english, japanese with subtitles, and japanese (for those fluent in the language) this is a wonderful edition for those who can find it. the material accompanying the movie disc has plenty of material for those wanting to learn about the production of the movie itself.

B000056HRZ|5.0|I highly recommend this film, and would give it many more stars if I could.  It's a great and entertaining film.  They don't make it like this anymore.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|how strange this album was released on 9/11/01 - the day when the whole world seemed to be turned upside down. It was an amazing escape to be able to put this album in the next morning and go back to what seemed like a much more simple time. Listening to &quot;Mississippi&quot; (the album's gem), High Water, Sugar Baby, and most of the others is an escape back to the Dylan albums of the early 70s, less BOTT more New Morning or Planet Waves but with stronger lyrics. I don't think I will ever be able to disassociate this incredible album from the tragedies of this week, but in a way that makes it even more special.
B000053V7Q|5.0|The re-editing of this feature film on the King left me wanting more, the sound, the colour are so much improved of the televised movie I saw some years ago. This dvd demonstrates how a movie can be improved with today's technology. It felt like being at the show live!
0767849493|1.0|The only thing funny about this movie is the fact that someone still thinks George Carlin is funny. From the moment he appeared in the beginning I knew this would be a turkey. A friend of mine recommended this and the premise sounded good, a comedy that knocks the Catholic Church? &quot;I'm there!&quot; I said. Instead, Kevin Smith actually lectures the audience through his character's dialogue which is insulting to an audience that paid money to laugh. You can tell that he thinks he's being clever about it too. Do movie-goers really spend money to hear a director's religious views? Movies are supposed to be an escape, especially comedies! Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are both completely annoying as two foul-mouthed angels. Jay and Silent Bob were great in Clerks which is one of my favorite movies. You start to get the feeling though that he's milking it for all it's worth. Enough already! I do agree that there are two many uptight religious fanatics who can't take a joke. Unfortunately there aren't any jokes to be found in this boring flick and that's the real sin.
6305327041|4.0|This film is a fast-paced romp written and directed by 4 different indie directors. They each have a story to tell that ties into the main story involving Tim Roth as a bell-hop ordered to run a small hotel by himself on New Years Eve. Suffice it to say that Roth gets WAY more than he bargained for, but don't worry, he'll get the last laugh! If you liked &quot;Dusk Till Dawn&quot; &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; or &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, and actually LAUGHED at times during those films, then you are truly sick enough to enjoy your stay in each and every one of these &quot;Four Rooms&quot;...
B000003S09|5.0|This is the first KC album I bought.  I had been an avid YES fan, and decided it was time to check out some other prog rock pioneers. KC was a YES contemporary (Jon Anderson appeared on one track on the &quot;Lizard&quot; album, which is now playing in the background as I write, and Bill Bruford left YES to take on a lengthy tour of duty behind the drums in KC). The repercussions of this album have been showing themselves throughout the ensuing decades; the So-Cal punk band Bad Religion released their version of &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; (a rewrite, not a cover), called &quot;21st Century Digital Boy&quot;. This album also introduced Greg Lake to the prog rock scene. He eventually left after the 2nd album to help form ELP.<BR>This album stands as a testament to the formation of the prog rock landscape. It reveals foundations both humble and ambitious. Mr. Fripp is a marvel in understatement, relying more on texture than flashiness. The tell-tale British reserve is perfectly represented here, as is their careful respect for tradition: this album can stand equally as a great rock album and as a tribute to various classical and jazz idioms.<BR>This is a must buy for any fan of music that seems to require some mental participation on the part of the listener. This music is very cerebral, yet that never gets in the way of the pure enjoyment of this, and indeed any, KC album.
1572522232|4.0|I thought this movie [was bad] when I first saw it years ago, but I've since changed my mind. Suspiria is several cuts above most of the Italian schlocko fests that pass for horror films. I read once where the Italian idea of horror is one of trying to capture the essence of a nightmare, therefor, contemporary logic need not apply. If you watch Suspiria with that idea in mind, it works very well. Don't ask why a ballet school would just happen to have a spare room full of razor wire, just suspend all rational and pretend you're in a nightmare world with it's own rules of reality. The strange characters, creepy lighting, and non-sequiter events are either ridiculous or mesmerizing, depending on your approach when watching this film. Shut off the lights and crank the sound. Everything in this film is meant to assault the senses, and the score is about the freakiest thing I've ever heard.
B000003S0P|4.0|Whereas all the previous albums (with the possible exeption of &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot;, to which I do not have the lyrics) had very engaging lyrics, &quot;Red&quot; seems to drop the ball somewhat. &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; seems so in love with itself; the music is quite ballsy, but the language is trite. I have come to reevaluate &quot;One More Red Nightmare&quot; in terms of the recent events of Sept. 11, 2001, in which the United States of America was the victim of a vicious terrorist attack.  The lyrics to this song have become very poignant, containing a sense of emotion that they previously were devoid of. I had always thought of the song as a rather witty take on the fears one encounters regarding flight, but in this trying time, those fears are elevated to a previously unimaginable level.<BR>Anyway, this CD is definately captivating from a musical standpoint; enough so that the lyrical content is hardly noticed. If only the early 80's KC had this kind of musicianship, then, well, then this would be a perfect world.<BR>Amen, Hallelujah.
630414542X|4.0|Highlander's one of those movies where if you 'get it', you like it. It's more than obvious many people who have reviewed it didn't get it. The story was interesting, the cinematography was inspiring, and the Scotish landscapes were breathtaking. As far as the acting goes, yes they could have done better. But it didn't detract from the mood of the film. I have the original VHS, the director's cut VHS, and the widescreen director's cut DVD. In that I acquired each as they became available, I've never regreted their purchase. On picture and sound quality, yes the DVD could have been better. But, again, it's not enough to detract from the mood of the film. And let's make no mistake about it, this picture is about mood and feelings. As far as the Queen music goes -- well, let's just say I've never been a fan. But even so, &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot; was quite appropriate for the sequence where it was played. And the Michael Kamen score (the orchestral pieces) is rousing and wonderful. I still don't care for the sequels or the series. But then, they are but shadows of what was attempted in the original movie. While the fight scenes weren't great (look at Crouching Tigar, Hidden Dragon for that), if you like a little swash and buckle, a little romance, some nice scenery, and an interesting story, I'd recommend this one.
B000003S0I|5.0|Welcome to KC, Mr. Bruford and Mr. Muir! The sometimes harsh percussion excursions on this album make for a truly unique experience. This album stands alone in the entire catalogue of KC material. Nowhere else is the use of percussion so thouroughly investigated than on &quot;Larks' Tongues in Aspic.&quot; From the maddening shifts in ferocity in the title track to the Pink Floyd-ish &quot;Easy Money&quot;, the two percussionists take center stage. I truly wish that Jamie Muir would've stayed on just a bit longer with KC; the material on &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; seem eerily empty without his presence. Later in KC's exitence, when Pat Mostello joined the soon to depart Bill Bruford on drums (the &quot;Thrak&quot; LP), it seemed that indeed the members themselves yearned for the tight percussives of &quot;LTIA.&quot; The effort was too little, too late.<BR>Regardless, this album is possibly one of the best of the KC output. It is a must have.
B000001FA4|3.0|I'm primarily a rock guy, and don't care so much for U2's softer-sounding CD's.  I'm speaking of this one and their latest, _All that you Can't Leave Behind_.
B00003CXSP|4.0|Hannibal is an excellent film, but it has little or nothing to do with the spirit of Harris's book. Thank the lord, probably, because the book was so horrific, it could never be filmed accurately.  I, and many I know, had to keep putting the book down while reading it--on film, it would be impossible to sit through. Harris's point was the corruption of the FBI and the federal government and that in comparison, the madness and evil of Hannibal Lecter was small potatos. In a world of such structural immorality, Lecter can become the protagonist one roots for. The world is truly turned upside down. In the film version, the public and private crucifixion of Clarice is barely touched upon, nor is the true evil of Mason Verger and the corruption he and his family spread in U.S. society. Without reading the book, one cannot realize the true dimensions of what was happening to Clarice, the one honest woman left in the USG, nor to the U.S. Congress and justice system. In light of this, it would have been impossible for Clarice and Hannibal to sail off into the Buenos Aires sunset together, as they did in the novel. So, much of the shock value and true tension of the book is lost in the film, and one has a traditional ending where the left hand of justice triumphs, ironically, and Clarice is left standing, still inside the 'system,' whether as a member of the FBI or not. Juliette Moore does very well as Clarice Starling, making one forget Jodie Foster. Anthony Hopkins, alas, is showing his age; if another sequel is in the works, they better make it fast. It's difficult to generate chills for a gereatric serial killer missing an appendage.
0767805712|5.0|Judging by the numerous reviews before me, I can skip the synopsis and critique part and get down to the nitty gritty.<br />This is one exceptional movie. It was simply way ahead of its time. I was much younger when I first saw it and didn't think much of it back then. Years later, I watched it again and the second time around, this movie affected me in so many levels that I kept thinking about it for many, many days. In short, entertainment at its best.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I own every Depeche Mode album and this one is working it's way to the top as my favorite. I have always admired Depeche Mode's ability to be different yet sell at the gold and platinum levels. This album is another example of what I like most of DM, their ability to grow; as people and musicians. They aren't afraid of their releases sounding drastically different from previous releases. I say &quot;drastically different&quot; because I was almost shocked when I heard the album for the first time. I remember feeling this &quot;shocked&quot; when &quot;Ultra&quot;, &quot;Violater&quot;, and &quot;Black Celebration&quot; were released. Of course, I may have been &quot;shocked&quot; but there is always something distinctly DM on every album and there is no question that DM has a spirit that shows in its music. <br />&quot;Freelove&quot; is distinctly reminiscent of &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; and I could do without &quot;The Dead of Night.&quot; But, &quot;I Am You&quot; is a wonderful new sound and feeling for DM that reaches back to &quot;Love in Itself&quot; and blends it with &quot;Home.&quot; I am truly impressed with the freshness of all of the new tracks.<br />The angst, anger and bitterness is almost gone from the days of &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; that persisted all of the way to &quot;Ultra.&quot; There is a new-found innocence to David Gahan's voice and Martin Gore's song-writing reflects a slightly more positive view of life. With &quot;Sweatest Condition&quot; having obvious ties to &quot;Violator,&quot; though, you can't mistake the history of DM.<br />If you are a DM fan (wavering or otherwise) you should definitly buy a copy of this CD. If you are new to DM, this is a good starting point before digging into their earlier work. If you are one of those people that &quot;sort of&quot; likes DM, I think you'll be impressed.

6300214559|5.0|This is a beautifully rendered period piece, with outstanding performances by the entire cast. A very young, petite and exquisite Helen Bonham Carter plays the title role of Lady Jane Grey, who was fifth in the line of succession to the throne of England upon the death of King Henry VIII in 1547. The first was Edward, King Henry VIII's only son. The second in the line of succession was Henry VIII's oldest daughter, Mary. The third was his other daughter, Elizabeth. The fourth was Lady Frances Grey, the Dutchess of Suffolk, and mother to Lady Jane Grey.<br /><br />Upon the death of King Henry VIII, his only son, nine year old Edward, became King Edward VI of England. His uncle, the Duke of Somerset, brother to Edward's mother, Jane Seymour, third wife of Henry VIII, ruled as Regent. In 1552, he was removed and beheaded. The ruthlessly ambitious John Dudley, the feared Duke of Northumberland, took his place as Regent. Here, the role of John Dudley is marvelously played with implacable and sinister resolve by John Wood.<br />King Edward VI, touchingly played by William Saire, very much likes his cousin, the quiet, religious, and intelligent Lady Jane Grey, and treats her kindly. Both are devout believers in the Reformed Church. In fact, her ambitious mother, the Dutchess of Suffolk, marvelously played with icy malice by Sara Kestelman, expects that they will probably wed. She does not count on Edward dying a premature death. The Duke of Northumberland, however, knows that the King is ill and will probably die. He realizes that with Edward's death his Regency and all the power that such office confers will be no more.<br /><br />So, in the Spring of 1953, he tells Frances that the King is ill and likely to die and proposes to Frances that Jane, instead, marry his somewhat dissolute youngest son, Guilford, dashingly played by the very young and handsome, Cary Elwes. Together they intrigue, as they know that Mary, a staunch Catholic, is next in the line of succession. Dudley tells her that since she is the fourth in the line of succession that she waive her rights to her daughter, Jane, who is fifth in line. He will have Edward sign a decree making Jane his successor, under the pretext of keeping the Reformed Church in and the Catholic Church out. This way England will remain Protestant.<br /><br />When her parents, the Duke and Duchess of Suffolk, inform Jane of the proposed match, she protests and objects. After being beaten by her mother, she relents and marries Guilford. They fall in love as only the very young can, impractical and full of high ideals. Then, their bliss is rendered asunder, when the perfidy of both their parents becomes apparent upon the death of King Edward VI. Jane and Guilford are hustled out of their home and taken to Court. There, Jane is informed that Edward decreed her his successor. She becomes a most reluctant Queen at the age of sixteen. It was a reign that would last all of nine days.<br /><br />What happens to Jane and Guilford, as well as all the other players in this first class drama, is well worth watching. In addition to the those performances already noted, Jane LaPotaire is magnificent as Queen Mary, and Patrick Stewart is marvelous as Henry Grey, the Duke of Suffolk, Jane's father, whose ill advised action in seeking to restore Jane to the throne was the functional equivalent of signing her death warrant himself. Look also for a touching performance by Jill Bennett in the role of Miss Ellen, Jane's attendant, who showed Jane the tenderness her parents failed to provide. With a first class cast and beautiful sets and costumes, this is a most enjoyable film. While not totally historically accurate, it is still a notable historical drama and a very enjoyable one at that.ley tells her that since she is the fourth in the line of succession that she waive her rights to her daughter, Jane, who is fifth in line.

0783211856|5.0|First, I would like to dedicate this review to all those who have suffered from the recent horrendous attacks in New York, The Pentagon and elsewhere. Why? Because a movie like &quot;Schindler's List&quot; reminds us that in the presence of unspeakable horror, we can still move on and conquer the evil that wishes to take us down. The Holocaust is undeniably the most horrific crime against humanity to date and Spielberg brings to vivid life here in a masterpiece that is timeless and important. The world must never forget because if one forgets history, it will surely repeat itself. We must never forget and never let our children forget of what we as humans, can sometimes be horribly capable of. But at the end of the film, brilliantly filmed in black and white which makes for beautiful images, we realize that good does triumph over evil and that one person can make a difference. In a time like this, when it seems like evil has won the battle, we must always remember that it takes an effort and risk to win. &quot;Schindler's List&quot; takes place in a time when evil men sought to rule the world but those with courage and hope did not give up. I am still reeling from the shock of the attacks in New York, tears have been shed and blood has been spilled. Let us pray for the victims and their families, but we must also not lose hope and a film like this is there to remind us that good men who strive for what's right, regardless of what must be sacrificed, can change things.
B000001IPL|2.0|This album is just like all their others, it has about four of the best songs you could think of and 10 other songs that suck.  That's how all their albums go, but when their songs are good, their really good.
B00005B5L4|5.0|This sounds great.  But you must have a 5 channel surround system for this to sound right with a compatible DVD audio or video player.  I have an APEX DVD and it works and sounds great.  I still like to listen to the old LP,  but this is quite an experience.  I just wish they would have mastered the original on it so you could play it in the car and I imagine that technology exists by now.

B000000W6R|5.0|Most bands don't even approach this with their A material. Billy Corgan is a musical genious with James Iha being quietly great along side. This collection contains several great soothing tunes like &quot;Blew Away&quot; &quot;Hello Kitty Kat&quot; &quot;Soothe&quot; and my personal favorite &quot;Whir&quot; which sounds incredible on a good stereo along with several others. Included with the soothers are only two rockers &quot;Frail and Bedazzled&quot; which is one of the best power tunes from the band and &quot;Plume&quot;. The rest are lighter tunes and all are great. The only one here that I don't care for is &quot;Girl Named Sandoz&quot; but some may like it. If you are new to the band grab it along with Siamese and Melancholy and if you are already a Pumkins fan it is a must. And I guess you can't forget Gish - just get all of the releases they are all unique and conatain some great stuff.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Nickelback have produced a superb follow-up to &quot;The State.&quot;  Chad Kroeger's vocal style, combined with the musical talent of the band allow for ten killer tracks.  This is especially true with &quot;Never Again,&quot; &quot;Woke Up This Morning,&quot; &quot;Too Bad&quot; and of course, &quot;How You Remind Me;&quot; a song which can reasonably be noted as the best song of this year.  <br />My only complaint with this CD is in its similarity to the angst-ridden lyrics of Staind.  Staind are an equally super band, but it seems to me that Nickelback have lost a little of their originality in their effort to co-exist in Staind's niche.<br />Nevertheless, this is a fantastic CD and I recommend it to all.

B00005M4JS|5.0|A fairytale fantasy of temptation by chocolate that is so seductive in nature, you must have some chocolate of any kind close by. The scenes literally drip with smooth liquid pleasure as chocolate is melted and then formed into creations of desire.<br /><br />Pleasures that await and a temptress who enchants an entire village with the call of chocolate melting slowly in your mouth is the theme around which this story is molded. There are moments of humor, an almost wild wind that calls to Vianne to follow her gypsy spirit and a handsome rover who challenges her sorcery.<br /><br />While the religious villagers show an outward piety, in their hearts they want to abandon themselves to temptation and happiness. Vianne arrives in the tranquil French town and in her own way changes the future. There are various ideas that are in a way, just a fantasy for some and for others may be a reality.<br /><br />Issues like having a child out of wedlock, leaving your husband and not going to church are portrayed in a \\"you choose the way to live\\" light. Morality is frowned on and this film makes no promises to those who don't want to just escape for 122 minutes. I found the religious aspects to be almost a comedy...which is not always a good thing, since those that don't see religion in a good light won't find it any more appealing. It also shed a light on the sometimes misinterpretation of how we are to live this life. Love is essential. There is a balance between pleasure and godliness. Somewhere in the middle you can find peace and happiness.<br /><br />In the style of a story, adult desires are captured and woven into a tale of pure pleasure. Anything that happens, does so only in your mind. Captivating from beginning to end. As a chocolate lover, I have always known that chocolate holds powers, no other food has. Chocolate brownies anyone. ;><br /><br />The appeal of the story comes from those pleasures we want to succumb to. With this movie, you can have all the fantasy and none of the guilt. Well, unless you are eating a container of chocolate brownie ice cream while watching it.<br /><br />An escape from the ordinary that will melt in your mind...<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewre eating a container of chocolate brownie ice cream while watching it.

Gaiman does a supurb job of weaving fairytale, myth, legend, fantasy, and a little science fiction into a complex, tale.<br />Reading this book, I was sucked into the parallel universe Gaiman had created with such detail. You couldn't help but appreciate the time and effort that must have gone into researching and learning about so many different religons and legends. His new twist on these ancient beliefs are what made this book exciting to read.

Lyrically, strange and wonderful in the way of the Anthology.  You can comb the Anthology lyrically and find all sorts of quotes from Love and Theft.  Like some modern painting, lots of interesting things are happening at once.

0767817664|4.0|This little flick has been one of my guilty pleasures ever since childhood.  It is not the greatest movie ever made, but it does deliver on its promise to scare, titillate, and tickle.  Add this 80's classic to the list of really fun B-movies: Flash Gordon, Lost Boys, Buckaroo Bonzai, Vamp, Easy Money, American Werewolf in London, Motel Hell . . . ah, those were the days.  Rather than repeat what many viewers have already said, I'll just give you my favorite scene: Evil Ed, Pencil in the Head.

B00003CXWV|4.0|&quot;Blow&quot; is a well done film depicting an era. Though the point of &quot;blow&quot; is kind of hard to figure out, it is an interesting movie to watch, and you find yourself mysteriously rooting for Jung as he rises and falls. <br />The best part of this film is the first part detailing Jung's rise to fame, and his doomed relationship with his first girlfriend. The shots of California and the beach are the quintessential way that we all wish it truly were. <br />Somewhat depressing, somewhat amusing, and always entertaining, you won't go wrong adding &quot;Blow&quot; to your collection. Depp is always good in all his roles.

Well,although the story seen to go a little slow and it concentrate more in some characters leaving many other important characters out,it still makes its point.The story has a message,a world were humans and mutants can live in peace and in my opinion I think the story fullfiled that part.

Great visuals, amazing performances (Sciorra and Williams are terrific, not to mention Cuba), great quemistry and a perfect movie.<BR>There are no words to describe it, except to say it is beautiful and it makes you have hope in love, 'cause in the end that's all that matters.<br />Whatch it! Buy it! You will not regret it!
B00005MNP7|5.0|About time Eat to the Beat was available on domestic release. This is a good remastering. Boy, it's good to hear &quot;Eat to the Beat&quot; and &quot;Living in the Real World&quot; in digital sound. <br />I do have a gripe: Capitol has done a wonderful job reissuing CDs by the Band. THey include the original artwork, exhaustive liner notes and additional photography. Those reissues do a good job enhancing the original recording. Here, the repackaging is a little sloppier. The bonus tracks don't add much. (Surely, there must have been some studio outtakes that would serve to round out this collection, rather than the muddy concert clips included here.) Mike Chapman's liner notes provide little new insight, and it's a shame that the sleeve artwork from the original CD aren't contained herein. Means I can't dump my vinyl version of this from way back when. <br />Oh well, it's a minor quibble -- certainly not enough to make me withhold my 5-star rating.  The core 12 songs that make up Eat to the Beat sound great here.
B00005QAPH|5.0|When I first saw the movie, it took me quite a while to figure out what Fellini was trying to tell us. I guess he intended to ridicule himself as a filmmaker, and I find it hilarious and clever in a sensational way. This mesmerizing masterpiece would grip your attention simply with the bizarre and imaginative opening scene, which is really a cinematic feast.<br />Thanks to Criterion, 8 1/2 is finally on DVD with a load of special features. I found the following information from DVD Planet. <br />The film is presented in Full-frame format, and the sound is mono as usual....<br />DISC ONE: Feature film; Screen-specific audio commentary by film critic and Fellini friend Gideon Bachmann, NYU Professor of Film Antonio Monda with excerpts from Fellini's interviews and letters and Deena Boyler's on-set diary; Introductioon by Terry Gilliam; Theatrical trailer. <br />DISC TWO: &quot;Fellini: A Director's Notebook&quot;; &quot;Nina Rota: Between Cinema And Concert&quot; documentary; Interviews; Still gallery.
B00005NZBN|5.0|Like a man delusional,<BR>Gone mad from drought,<BR>I cried at the presence of water,<BR>Down in the dead well.<br />Dylan makes the rest of the so-called performers on the current music scene look like no-talent novices.  Finally, a work of sheer musical genius.
B00000JGEF|5.0|This is one of Arnold's best action films.  If consider yourself an Arnold Schwarzenegger fan you have to get this movie.  I like this movie because it is everything you would except an action movie to be.  The plot, Arnold and his squad of elite Army Commandos got to a remote South American jungle and think they are going to rescue South American officials captured by terrorists.  The Predator has something different in mind.  Arnold's team gets picked off one by one by this mysterious creature that seems to be hunting them.  Predators are aliens that go to planets and hunt the species living there.  The Predators have been coming to Earth for centuries, they are attracted to heat and will only hunt somthing that has a weapon.  This is a classic action movie that you must see. A great action-packed suspense thriller that will keep you guessing and keep you on your toes.  <br />Also see the sequel: Predator 2
044022425X|4.0|As a huge fan of Diana Gabaldon's work, I eagerly awaited the fourth installment of this saga. I was a little anxious that after three books the writing might have lost some of it's power. Not so. I found that the author has continued her along the same winning way as in the three previous books and with the change of continent, infused not only Jamie with a new and intriguing life ahead, but Claire  also is faced (perhaps for the first time) with the uncertainty of not really knowing what lies ahead.<BR>I found myself enjoying this fourth book as much as the others ( although I think Crosstitch is still the most riviting of them all for it's sheer suspense) and I am chomping on the bit while waiting for the next installment in the lives of Jamie and Claire
B00005JKHP|5.0|This is the one Star Trek that carries the torch of the main elements of the television series far better than the others that followed. It dares to go where no man has gone before and does so with astonishing visions. I have only seen one movie(2001: a space odyssey) that compares in terms of visuals. The interior of the V'Ger vessel is simply amazing and the story that builds to the ultimate climax is still interesting to me. The special effects hold up today and then some. I would much rather see this than the CGI of today. As for the acting, yes it is wooden for the most part but I honestly dont care. It is perfect in its way. To me, the definitive Trek film.
B00000G3HZ|1.0|So many years later, I decided to give it another try.  It was worse than I remembered.  If you enjoy watching a bunch of boring losers sit around and whine, you will love it.
B00005NWM3|4.0|i just got this cd, and honestly, i bought it for &quot;how you remind me.&quot; but after listening to a few of the other songs, this cd is just as good, if not better than their debut.
B00000K0DT|4.0|I rented this because it is on some top 100 list, and I was surprised at how engaging I found it. The acting is good, the plot is fascinating. I couldn't even have guessed the ending. The film alternates between scenes from the present and about 6 months prior. Some may find that unnerving, but it is very well written. I recomend this film for anyone who likes mysteries or crime stories.
0385335482|5.0|Sophia Kinsella is a utterly brilliant--or &quot;brill&quot; as a real Brit would say. In &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic,&quot; Kinsella has a created a loveable but looney character who is funnier than Bridget Jones (really). This is a truly stellar entry in what my husband teasingly refers to as the &quot;British Chick Book&quot; genre. <br />In the hapless Rebecca, Kinsella has created a laugh-out-loud funny heroine any clothes-loving, finance-challenged gal can relate to. (And who hasn't misused their Visa at least once or twice?) Of course, Rebecca's financial foibles come with a twist: she's actually a financial journalist, who deals with her own money woes by stuffing letters from the bank in her top drawer (out of sight, out of mind) and solid savings plans, such as winning the lottery.<br />&quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; is well-written and terrifically funny. What more could you ask for in a book? I can't wait for Kinsella's next novel!
0780631684|2.0|I found the story idea for this film very interesting, and the writer and director could have done so much more with it.  However, as it stands, the movie is quite boring.  There are so many elements to this movie that could have been fleshed out more.  What comes to mind, particularly, is the surrealistic encounter with the man at the funeral home.  They could have brought his character in again at a later time for some more interest.
B000006T0D|5.0|Deborah Harry's face on the cover of this album still hypnotizes me.  I can look at it forever.<BR>After this legend band's first 3 albums, what would they come up next?  They had achieved fame, Deb had become an icon, they had joined the NY avante-garde artsy crowd.  The band evolved and gave us the sublime Eat to the Beat, undeniably still a Blondie album but ahead of it's time.  Harry's voice becomes a miracle, but I've always felt that Clem Burke's amazing drumming drove this band and this becomes clear on the album's first<BR>cut &quot;Dreaming&quot;. The funk/rock sound of &quot;The Hardest Part&quot; was new for the band and they successfully explode from your headphones. &quot;...Nitro and acetalyne, open la machine&quot; - are these perfect lyrics or what?  The reggae/punk sound of &quot;Die Young, Stay Pretty&quot; is also new, and ROCKS.  Deb calls you &quot;.. a dried-up twig in your family tree&quot;.  Damn!  Her voice in &quot;Shayla&quot; haunts you.  The perfection of &quot;Atomic&quot; and &quot;Union City Blue&quot; makes these tunes eternal.  &quot;Slow Motion&quot; is pure Blondie pop.  And they perfectly describe being famous on &quot;(I'm Not)Living in the Real World&quot;.<BR>Eat to the Beat changed my &quot;musical expectations&quot; forever.  Listen to it and grow.
078401020X|5.0|The movie was very fast-paced and provocative! One of the reasons I watched it was because of Sharon Stone giving her greatist if not deadly &amp; sexually inticing performance as a novelist with a sexual urge that entraps Michael Douglas! A truly beautiful if not dangerous movie!
B000006NPY|5.0|I'm not a Smashing Pumpkins fan however I was awfully curious to hear &quot;Adore&quot; because I heard nothing but complaints from the so called diehard fans. I hate to see bands churning out the same ol' material for the sake of pleasing their narrow-minded fans. If the Smashing Pumpkins had continued churning out &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; or &quot;Melancholy and the Infinite Sadness&quot; they would have just come off sounding tiresome and redundant like a lot of bands do today.<br />&quot;Adore&quot; is an experimental album for the Pumpkins which should have succeeded but instead it failed to the displeasure of many fickle fans. I originally thought that &quot;Adore&quot; would sound something like The Cardigans' &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;, that Garbagey rock/trip hop sound. I didn't think the music was as influenced by electronica music as a lot of people claimed that it was but it certainly had a lot more textural layers musically than before.<br />&quot;To Sheila&quot; is a stunning kick off to this gorgeous album. It is a quiet, acoustic ballad that made me reconsider Billy Corgan's abilities as a songwriter. &quot;Behold! The Night Mare&quot; is a drop dead gorgeous eight minute epic ballad that really took my breath away. A perfect goth song I thought. The music on &quot;Adore&quot; is a far cry from the band's previous albums beginning with &quot;Gish&quot;. I  consider &quot;Adore&quot; more of a goth album with the melancholy lyrics and fragile melodies. A classic album in my book.
6304140711|5.0|this psychotic thriller brings out the best acting abilities in both mark wahlberg and reese witherspoon, along with alyssa milano and others.  \\"fear\\" is about a rebel-type guy (mark wahlberg) who falls for the girl-next-door-type (reese witherspoon), but when reese's family interveins in their relationship mark decideds it's time they DIE.  i DEFINATELY recommend this movie.  it's awesome!
B000000993|5.0|TOOL's adam jones use his guitar in such a way that is undiscrible the feed back in intolorence is so complex and uncontrolable but adam can use like it was his voice, [....] they can actually play. a must have for real music fan and guitarist (bass guitarist too)
6301095014|1.0|I just thought people should know that this film is dedicated to the &quot;dedicated to the gallant people of Afghanistan&quot;.  Amazing isn't it?
B00005NW02|5.0|I have had the first soad album sense it came out and i got this the day it came out. toxicity is defently different from the self title album it faster more hard core and less of darons awsome solos, and the chop suey song is the only song like that pretty much (which is a good thing cuase that is way to acoustic for soad0 the rest of the stuff is pretty good. system of a down is the future of music.
B00000BKDV|5.0|Maiden is one of my very favorite mainstream metal bands, up there with old Metallica. As I type this I am listening to &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot; for the thousandth time, and am no less blown away than at first listen. I just got this album a few days ago, having only seen the videos to &quot;Flight&quot; and &quot;Trooper.&quot; The whole album rocks as well. Some of Smith/Murray's most sky-straddling dual solos are on here. To me, &quot;The Trooper&quot; is Maiden's centerpiece, on this disc or any other. From opening blazer &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; to closing epic &quot;To Tame a Land&quot; this record is on fire, inspired, and inspirational to so many succeeding bands. The crushing production is a plus too. &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; was my fave but now has been eclipsed by this disc as my favorite Maiden opus, though I recommend &quot;Somewhere&quot;, &quot;Number of the Beast&quot;, &quot;Powerslave&quot;, and to a lesser extent, &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; as well. Maiden were at their most focused in the 80's, though the 90's yielded occasional gems as well. Classic power metal at its best! Now to purchase the much praised return-to-form &quot;Brave New World&quot;. Rock on Maidenheads!
0792156684|5.0|A stunning achievement in every aspect.  This movie deserves a place among the classics.  This is no chick flick.  It is a movie that everyone needs to experience, if only once.  Do so with an open mind! Colossal epic.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is just one of the most intelligent, innovative, and suspenseful brain teasers to come along in years. Definitely reminiscent of the Hitchockian suspense, where you're guessing until the final scene. Memento is abot a man who's short term memory has been destroyed and he is trying to puzzle together the clues to who murdered his wife and who assaulted him and gave him this condition. The movie is brilliant in the sense that we are as clueless as the main character Lenny, we are trying to piece things together with him and in doing so we question our own memories and interpretations of the facts. Guy Pearce is swift and glides gracefully from scene to scene with that fragment of fear upon his face like anyone in a condition where they couldnt remember one thing from the next. We totally empathize with his character and we are totally right there with him with each lost and lingering gaze. Memento is so smart that it out smarts even the most intricate investigator, it makes you apart of the puzzle. You become the eyewitness. The eyewitness who can only see what they want too and process the facts. By this movie's end, you'll question what you've seen and heard and wonder have you identified the killer or made yourself the suspect.
B00000ICD9|5.0|You must be prepared to watch this movie.  This movie will stretch you.  This movie will challenge your beliefs.  This movie is very &quot;artsy.&quot;  Robin Williams is fabulous as usual.  The visual effects are staggering.  This movie has left a lasting impression on me, and it is a work of art.
B00005B6C9|5.0|BeeGees lates album &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; show that they'll always be the greatest! You would just love listening to their music in your car with the volume cranked up and the windows down. Terrific cruising music!! Here are my few favorite songs from this album:<br />This Is Where I Came In: I like the strong drums and guitar in this song. <br />Sacred Trust: Lovely song with a good beat. I love it when the music fades out and you hear only the nice harmonizing voices of Barry, Robin, and Mauric Gibb.<br />Man In The Middle: It has a sort of &quot;Moody Blues&quot; type of feel, with neat synthesizer and drums. Chorus is really nice.<br />Walking On Air: Another song which reminds me of &quot;Moody Blues&quot;. The lyrics are real nice, with words like &quot;I think I'm walking on air, so much in love I can't tell what I'm saying...&quot;<br />Embrace: The words are so good in the song &quot;Embrace&quot;. Whenever I listen to this album with my family, we always have to listen to this song.<br />And practically all of the songs are fantastic with such good lyrics. If you're a BeeGees fan, this is an album that you have to buy and listen to!
B000035P80|3.0|Most people who come to see this are those who are fans of Bob Dylan's music. After seeing this, i still like his music, but one finds it difficult to admire the man behind the songs afterward. Aside from the gripping performances (and the amusing &quot;Subterrarean Homesick Blues&quot;), we see Dylan rudely and arrogantly treating almost everyone around him with gross contempt. He's really hard to like after seeing this. However, Joan Baez brightens things up by allowing us to see her lighter side. She makes wild faces into the camera and does an amusing belly-dance parody.
B00005NZBN|5.0|rock'n roll's poet laureate has put together another extraordinary cd! This cd is better than &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;. His band is in top form and these songs are a collection of all types of music genres. You probably won;t hear any of these songs on the radio because the radio formats are too slow to realize that the sing songwriter is back! And Dylan is back in a big way. Buy this cd, you won't be disappointed!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I loved this movie, probably the best musical of all-time. I bought the soundtrack before seeing the movie cause I had heard Lady Marmalade before. So I got it listened to it over and over. Then saw the movie. I was extremely disaponted at the lack of songs on the cd. I heard Baz is in the owrks on a 2 CD soundtrack featuring the missing songs. I hope it comes out I will snatch it up as soon as it comes out. But I'm sure more people would have bought it if &quot;Spectacular,Spectacular&quot;, &quot;The sound of Music&quot;, &quot;The Can-can Mix/Zidler's Rap&quot; &quot;The Show Must Go on&quot;, &quot;Nature Boy&quot; (by John Leguizamo) and &quot;Come What May&quot; (movie version) were on it. Those are the best songs from the movie. &quot;Because we Can&quot; gets annoying after listening to it so long, and I loved it when they mixed MARMALADE, and Smells Like Teen Spirit into it.
B000056K04|3.0|If you are a radio rock/pop junkie, this album might catch on and introduce you to some &quot;new&quot; music, but for those who have followed Dave Matthews, it is a huge disappointment. Gone are the days of the lengthier jams with meaningful solos. Gone is almost all musical interaction and intensity found on previous endeavors. Instead it is replaced by formulaic, flat and meaningless music.<br />Glen Ballard (producer) has tried to fix something that wasn't broken. And for anyone who has heard the sessions recorded with Steve Lillywhite (who produced the previous CDs) dubbed &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot; knows that &quot;Everyday&quot; is not the REAL Dave Matthews Band. While the music on this CD is not at all bad, it is just a watered down version of one of the most eclectic and creative groups around. And to know that an entire album as good as &quot;Lillywhite&quot; sits on the shelves just makes it even worse.<br />So release &quot;Lillywhite&quot; already!!
6304398395|1.0|Downey Jr. is too fat and \\"subdued\\" to pass as the lanky energetic Chaplin. He also affects this cockney accent that Chaplin never possessed. Ackroyd never fails to suck the life out of any movie with his hambone brand of \\"acting\\". The movie reveals nothing, save for nude shots of Mila.
B00004U8H4|4.0|Although I was immediately smitten with the GORGEOUS Christian Bale (just to check out his perfect body is worth the price of the film!), the first time I watched this movie I was confused.  Bale portrays Patrick Bateman, a sterotypical 1980's corporate yuppie, who suffers through each business day pretending to be someone he is NOT!  As you watch Bale move through the movie, it is obvious he is one of the great acting talents of today.  He scares the hell out of you as the apparent corporate vice president by day, psycho serial killer by night.  Oh, but IS he?  What a contrasting transformation Bale makes from his role in the wonderful movie &quot;Little Women&quot; as the suffering and love struck wanna be beau of &quot;Jo&quot;.  The second time I watched this film, I was left with the conclusion that the character of Patrick Bateman was not a serial killer at all, but a repressed business man venting his fantasies through the course of the film.  I reached this conclusion because his victims seemed to mysteriously disappear when he'd go back to get rid of the body, or were spotted by other corporate suits while traveling abroad.  Bateman's reaction to these &quot;spottings&quot; of his victims and the real estate agent's denial of any bodies lends some sense to my theory.  I love Reese Witherspoon, but she was miscast as Bateman's boring fiance, and Samantha Mathis' role as Bateman's lover wasn't much more exciting.  The movie has it's moments, though, and several times I caught myself sitting up straight and paying attention!  I will probably get emails telling me I am completely wrong, but believing Bateman's murdering and mayhem is only supposed to be in his mind made the movie more credible and believable to me.  It is DEFINITELY a &quot;keeper&quot; for the home theater library.  I bought the uncut version.  A campy, scary, funny film!
B000002GQJ|5.0|One day I was looking through some singles in one of the sales I loved going to at our local church. I came across 'Question' and was curious to hear it as it had been #1 in the UK but not played in Australia. I was so impressed I went straight out and bought  'A Question Of Balance', my first Moodies album, knowing for someone to produce such a beautiful song, the album HAD to be great. It turned out to be every bit as good as I expected and is close to my all time fave album. Every track is a joy, with strong melodies and lyrics.  The lyrics of  the track 'The Balance' are particularily brilliant in the way they reflect on our existence.
0446677450|2.0|Written way too basic for what it sells itself to be.The first two chapters sums up the whole book. There are no, I repeat No specific detailed examples of how or what to do. Only generalizations here!
081541028X|4.0|Michael Collins was command module pilot of the historic Apollo 11 mission to the moon in July 1969. Had he not forged such a distinguished record of achievement in the cockpits of exotic, out-of-this-world air &amp; space craft, first as fighter jet test pilot and then as astronaut, Collins would have likely experienced noteworthy success at the keyboard as a writer. After seeing this book on a recent list of the &quot;100 Greatest Adventure Stories,&quot; I decided to give it a read. Collins' brilliant narrative helped me rediscover those feelings of admiration, wonder and awe that I experienced as a young boy while watching the space launches and moon walks on B&amp;W TV. This is a fascinating, revealing and oh so candid first person account of the pathway that took Collins to the moon and back--his early career as a fighter jet test pilot, selection and induction into the astronaut corps, preparation and training of an astronaut, the personalities of many of Collins' colleagues in the space program, the exquisite and intricate planning intended to minimize the risks to these brave explorers and ensure their success, his own anxieties and something of the impact on the families of the astronauts. All of technology's wonderous achievements of the last 20 years, e.g., laptop computers, cellular phones, internet, cable TV, etc. seem to pale in comparison to the marvel of sending man to the moon and bringing him home again...safely. While circling the moon in the command module Columbia, Collins needed to correctly press a sequence of computer buttons 850 times just to manage a successful rendezvous with his partners Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin as they returned from the surface of the moon in the lunar module Eagle. Just one example among many of the incredible vision and engineering and planning involved in NASA's glory years of success. Despite his wonderful accomplishments, Collins does not take himself too seriously, tells his story with wry humor and is maybea little irreverent. His story sent tingles up and down my spine again...after all these years!
0671024256|5.0|As a hopeful writer, just beginning, at age 18, I found Stephen King's memoir extremely powerful and helpful. He has a great way of writing that makes the reader both respect him and relate with him. He's one of the richest authors in the world and yet he doesn't talk down to you or gloat about about his status. Instead he gives it to you straight.<br />I've not read any of his novels, I've seen a few of his film versions, but it wasn't his body of work that lead me to this memoir, but rather I was interested in how he did it. He's talented, orginal, both respected and critized, and he's extremely famous. You don't have to have read any of his novels to get the power of this memoir, that's not to say it wouldn't help. In fact this book has encouraged me to read some of his novels. Finding the secrets behind them have made me want to read them.<br />The style of the book is easy. He begins telling you about himself and his childhood through his adulthood. He then focuses on the process of writing, how to do it and how to go about publishing, but he does this as a friend might. He never says this is the only way to do anything. This is what worked for him and he never lets you forget the luck that goes along with his success and anyone's for that matter. He then discusses the accident that nearly killed him and how he survived.<br />If you are a big fan of King or an inspiring writer, pick this book up and you will not regret it. It's both informative and touching. It's warm and cold and will leave you with a slightly different view of the King himself.
B00005ASHM|5.0|After Marvin Gaye's WHAT'S GOING ON, the best album ever.
B000002UAC|5.0|&quot;With The Beatles&quot; sees the Beatles finding their footing in the pop world considerably solidified.  This is their second album, and features such classic Lennon/McCartney compositions as &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; (which was, interestingly enough, the Rolling Stones' first hit), &quot;All My Loving&quot; and &quot;It Won't Be Long.&quot;  The Fab Four also lend their own treatment to Smokey Robinson's &quot;You Really Got A Hold On Me&quot; and &quot;Till There Was You,&quot; from Meredith Willson's &quot;The Music Man.&quot;  This is actually one of my all-time favorite albums.  Its pacing and song selection display the early Beatles' talents to a tee.<br />The cover art, with its chiarascuro lighting effects, is a photograph taken by Astrid Kirscherr.  Kirscherr was the fiancee of Stuart Sutcliffe, the Beatles' original bass player.
0060987464|5.0|I have always been a fan of manson's music, but I never really knew what was true about him and what was false. As it turns out, this book showed me a side of life that i'd never been shown before. It is a book that is very hard to put down, and i've found myself reading until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, for hours straight. The book gives many insights into manson's life, and why he is the way he is today, but it also shows that Manson is a bright individual, who knows what he's talking about. This book shines suprising reality on what you may have taken for granted before. My view of the world is certainly much different after reading this book. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a much different view of the world. I have lent it to several of my friends and they have confessed to me that they were suprised by how good of a book it was.  If you want something that will keep you reading page after page, i say you buy this book.
6304806426|5.0|This is one of the most beautifully made movies in history. The clean and clear transfer to DVD makes it even more beautiful. It has one of the finest actors playing the star in Ralph Fiennes. It also has Dafoe and Binoche. The story is long yes, but why does that have to be a bad thing? If the movie is good, it shouldn't matter how long it is (that goes for you Leanard Maltin). This film has everything and deserved to win the academy award for best picture (although Fargo should have won this is still a great choice however).
B000002B30|5.0|Greatest Hits albums are going to be a blessing and a curse in every situation. They are of course a blessing because you get great songs, often the cream, on one disc -- very convenient for your car CD player, for example.<br />Of course, by getting a Greatest Hits album you are only getting the most popular, not necessarily the best, songs. And with Springsteen, if all you ever bought and listened to was this record it would be a damned shame, because there has been no other single artist in the past 30 years with as deep a catalogue of songs. <BR>In fact, because Springsteen's albums are each so rich and lacking in duds, one can certainly question the wisdom of a Greatest Hits album. There is a certain assumption behind hits compilations that they allow you to avoid the dreck that populates 80 percent of the songs that record companies do not release as singles -- a problem that Springsteen does not have.<br />But for a casual fan or a serious Springsteen follower who wants one disc full of hits to go along with the rest of their collection, this does the trick.
6304233639|4.0|This was a very entertaining movie. Earth is invaded by evil alien forces. Nothing the earthlings try can stop the invading aliens. You have an outstanding hero model with Will Smith. This role made me a Will Smith fan. There are action sequences that are too numerous to count. The scenery thar displys the destruction that is brought by the aliens is unbelivieable. The special effects that are used in this movie are also great.There<br />is also a good rescue of planet earth by Will Smith. You must see this movie. It is well worth your viewing time. This movie will be a collectors item. Buy it.

0790741164|4.0|Oliver Stone obviously had his own conspiracy theory about what happened on that cold November day in 1963.  So he made it into a movie with the help of real life New Orleans District Atttorney, Jim Garrison.  The result, an entertaining, but thought provocative film.  We'll never know the answers about what happened, but Stone gives us some food for thought.
B00000255F|5.0|Two songs from this album -- Thunder Road and the title track -- have simply the best lyrics of any rock songs, ever. When sung with Springsteen's voice, they become epics that so successfully captured the yearning to escape to a new American dream while the old one was rusting away. These songs remain Springsteen's finest work today, and should be in every collection.<br />As an aside, both Thunder Road and Born to Run were actually taught as part of my college Poetry textbook. They more than held their own against Sylvia Plath, IMHO.
B00005NGAL|1.0|This is a severely edited and shortened atempt at presenting &quot;Cats&quot; This attemt to push this great musical on the public fades as only a small screen presentation of a ghosttly  show, with star turns for people who do not deserve to be brought to the forground.

B00005KHJT|5.0|This version is so raw. It's awesome.More scenes makes it even better. So I suggest you buy it.MIchael MYers in this film is so freaky killin everyone.Can't wait for halloween 8 to hit theatres.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I love this CD.  Admittedly, I am a fervent Dylan fan-atic.<br />If you had never heard Dylan in your life, you might be intrigued by this collection.  You might wonder who in the world is this man with the smokey voice, and where did these eccentric lyrics come from and what, if anything, do they mean?<br />But, if you've ever loved Blonde on Blonde or Highway 61 Revisited or Bringing it all Back Home or Blood on the Tracks or Desire or Time Out of Mind (to name only a few), you will hear this CD and you will smile because you will know that Dylan's muse has been working overtime.  You will chuckle at the silliness, you will laugh out loud with joy to hear the intonations that are uniquely Dylan, and your heart will soar at the romance and feeling here.  Only he can accent in that oh so surprising place and bend that line, confounding you to sing along.  The added bonus is the talent and brilliance of his backing band (with whom he also tours) on this recording.<br />Who is this funny little man who, for forty years, has been loved, studied and revered by millions?  He has given us his life, forsaking anonymity, to do not only what he loves to do but what he seems driven to do.  As Joan Baez wrote, \\"You're a savage gift on a wayward bus, but you stepped down and you sang to us.\\" <br />If you love Dylan, don't miss Love and Theft.  If you don't know Dylan, Love and Theft is a great place to start, but you've got a lot of catching up to do....<br />Thank you, Mr. Dylan, for bringing joy and delight to us once again.  May you truly be Forever Young.  You are amazing, and we are blessed.
B00005K3OT|4.0|First off, Chocolat is a metaphor -- a metaphor for thinking in new ways, trying new things, renewing the human spirit, enjoying life and salving deep emotional wounds. On that level the movie works wonderfully well, with Juliet Binoche giving a marvelously subtle performance that balances her character on the edge of vulnerability while exuding confidence.<br />Some windy sourpusses reviewing this simple, wonderful and heartwarming tale (How many of those does Hollywood put out a year? Two, three?) seem to focus on The Horror that the main character tempts townspeople with chocolate during Lent, and therefore it is anti-Catholic. Those arguments are simply silly dreck. It's not anti-Catholic, it's anti-dogma and pro-tolerance and pro-living. I suppose those reviewers would be happy if the townsfolk had burned the woman at the stake for being different and a veritable magician!<br />Unless you will be offended by temptation (in which case you shouldn't see ANY movie), you will find Chocolat a delicious treat.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This CD is the best. It's better than their first album.<br />1.Affirmation-Too many &quot;I believe's&quot;....just kidding, I like this song, good way to start the CD- 4.5/5<br />2.Hold Me- I love this song! This is song is very sweet-5/5<br />3.I Knew I Loved You- First single, very sweet and very nice. You get kind of tired of it though. 4.5/5<br />4.The Best Thing- The chorus is VERY VERY catchy. First time I listened to it, I already knew the chorus- 4/5<br />5.Crash and Burn- I also love this song. It's very cool and inspiring- 5/5<br />6.Chained to You- Not my favorite song but good 3/5<br />7.The Animal Song- A head bopping song, a toe tapping one too. I like it. 4/5<br />8.The Lover After Me- Another great song. It's very sweet.5/5<br />9.Two Beds and a Coffee Machine- MY FAVORITE SONG OF THE WHOLE ALBUM! It's very very pretty and sad- 10/5...<br />10.You Can Still Be Free- Very soft at first but gets loud through out the song. I really like it. 5/5<br />11.Gunning Down Romance- This is a very cool song. I love the ending- 5/5<br />12.I Don't Know you Anymore- A very sad and pretty song. I love it 5/5<br />BUY THE ALBUM IF YOU WANT TALENT
B000001ESF|5.0|Mix: <BR>1) Three supremely talented musicians.<BR>2) Sci-Fi inspired, over-the-top lyrics.<BR>3) Hard-driving guitar-and-drum heavy rhythms.<br />Take away all limits on creativity, such as time limits for songs (2112 is more than 20 minutes long), and you get a unique record. You won't hear this much on the radio, but it's great at a concert and its great on your CD player. Really great stuff.
6305165912|5.0|Amazingly funny, *GREAT* performances (especially from John Goodman and John Turturro) and extremely well-written. I appreciate something different everytime I watch it, but I always laugh. <br />The whole thing starts with Bridges' character, Jeff Lebowski (who insists on being addressed as &quot;The Dude&quot;), being attacked by a pair of thugs who are unknowingly looking for a DIFFERENT Jeff Lebowski. The story is full of ridiculous coincidences like this and branches off into all sorts of outrageous and creative subplots. The characters are all very unique and most of the comedy comes from their interaction with each other, which is obviously very enjoyable to watch. <br />The DVD includes a nice making-of/interview featurette... but as always, I would've loved to see more.<br />Highly recommended; those easily offended by bad language may not have as much fun as my wife and I did. For more of the same, see Raising Arizona or O Brother, Where Art Thou? Brilliant.
B00002R0MC|5.0|From Judge Not to Redemption Song, Songs of Freedom spins a mesmerizing web about you that can only be called inspirational and transformational. You can dance to the beat, you can cry, you can laugh, you can sing along, but always you will listen and be touched. An important voice for social justice, a poignant plea for understanding and brotherhood, a love songs so real it hurts. All are here in spades.<br />This is the definitive Bob Marley collection. Every song is not just good, but transcendant. The collection traces Marley from his roots in the Jamaican ghetto to the height of his powers shortly before he died, more than 20 years ago.<br />There is also an excellent companion book that explains the songs and gives an excellent brief history of Marley's career.<br />That certainly helps with songs like &quot;Trenchtown Rock.&quot; Trenchtown is a slum built atop a stinky sewage trench -- so you can tell immediately and viscerally where Marley is coming from.<br />This compilation belongs in everyone's collection.
B000002MJC|5.0|I bought this album soon after it was released in 1993. Until that day I used to hate DM except for some of their good songs. One of my friends highly recommended this one. This album is generally a dark one, i think it represents Dave Gahan's mood in those years. His vocals are excellent, very different tunes of guitar and keyboard has been used in the record. The lyrics are, of course, very good. It is a &quot;complete&quot; album so I am not going to mention any favorites here. This album surely deserves a reasonable place in music history. Don't buy this album if you are expecting a synth-pop record.
B000001FY9|5.0|You could hardly do better than Legend. Marley's inspired anthems and soft, soulful ballads are on full display here. While not as definitive as the Songs of Freedom box set, this CD should be a part of anyone's collection of the greatest music of all time. Marley remains an inspiration more than 20 years after his death.
B000059MEK|5.0|Recently I got the new Daft Punk cd called \\"Discovery\\".  If you haven't heard of Daft Punk, then you probably aren't familiar with electronica.  Anyway, back in the olden times in 1997, I was staying up at 2:00A.M. for various reasons *cough*crack*cough* and I watched mtv, like anyother crack addi*err* music addict, yeah, that's it!<br />i saw this music video called \\"Around The World\\" and I was astonished.  I mean, wow.  It's basically a uniform, synchonized disco-dance music video, with people in costumes (skeliton suits, robot suits, swim suits?)  and it was very, VERY odd.  I thought I was dead, I really did.  I remember in the music video, it had no vocals, and just daft punk's song, Around The World.  I swear it was something to freak all over.<br />In 7th grade, I mentioned the music video to my friend logan.  He said he saw the same music video, and it was by a band called \\"Daft Punk\\".  He said he had the music video on a tape at his house, but he never found it.  In 8th grade, pretty recently, he or I brought up the subject again.  Now that i had the skills, knowledge, and power, i downloaded the music video from Morpheus.  It was freaking AWESOME.  I swear to goodness, it r0x0r3d.  So then I downloaded the song in mp3 format.  That was cool.  I got pretty interested in their music style and their coolness.<br />Recently, Daft Punk Released a new album, Discovery.  I wasn't too terribly interested, and the months passed.<br />On Cartoon Network recently, they aired 4 daft punk music videos for their new album (all animated, of course).  The music impressed me so much, I went to Hastings the next day and bought the album.<br />The packaging of the album is very simple with a \\"Daft Punk\\" logo, if you will, that is metallic with a splash of rainbow.  The back is also simple, and it has a black background with white text giving all of the names of the tracks on the cd.  If you open up the case, you will find a cd booklet with lyrics to some of their songs, a photo of the two recording music on a piano, and the times of each track.  Then behind the cd itself, is a \\"Daft Club\\" card that has a 16-digit pin to get into their members only web site so you can download unrealsed, remixed, and uncut tracks from their new album, and their old album, Homework.  All and all, I felt this album was one of the best albums I have ever purchased.
0790734850|5.0|L.A. Confidential is a movie just frankly out of place in the modern cinema. A wholly realized vision of studio-run Hollywood, the movie feels like an old studio film. <BR>A love triangle, corruption, ambition and celebrity scandal all swirl about a plot that is well-executed and has the look and feel of a classic.<BR>The character-driven screenplay has plenty of twists and turns, and top-flight actors Kevin Spacey, Kim Basinger, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce (among others in this all-star cast) give Bogart and Bacall a run for their money.
B000002LGQ|4.0|Closing the 1980's is Madonna's 1989's contraversial fourth album, 1989's gospel infused &quot;Like A Prayer,&quot; and her first trip into spirituality. After a bitter January 5th divorce from Sean Penn, you can hear the dicussions of her relationship with him on this album. Concidered her more mature work where people took her more seriously as an artist, became a success. Always experimenting with different styles and knows no bounderies, she mixes gospel, pop/rock, dance, ballads, and Spanish/ Latin music. Dedicated to her Mother who taught her how to pray.<br />Opening with the gospel-infused title track 5:39, which starts out hauntingly, and the dance energy of the hit &quot;Express Yourself&quot; 4:37. She seems to get up in the clouds with the pop duet with Prince &quot;Love Song&quot; 4:52 (where their singing &quot;this is not a love song). She didn't do a bad job (sorry Prince fans), but he drove me crazy and I didn't care for this one. The destination sound of &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot; 5:16 has a beautiful melody with her chanting some of the words like a story, and the sad ballad &quot;Promise To Try&quot; 3:36 seems to describe the loss of her Mother. The sweet, thoughtful pop hit &quot;Cherish&quot; 5:03 brings back the upbeat sound, and the sweet fantasy sound of &quot;Dear Jesse&quot; 4:20 shows an innocent side to her. She gets more melancholy with the haunting ballad &quot;Oh Father&quot; 4:57, then gets back into the groove with dance single of Keep it together&quot; 5:03 (made a great single). She then gets to the haunting tragic Spanish ballad, my favorite &quot;Pray For Spanish Eyes&quot; 5:15, that if you were to get this for one song-this would be it. Wrapping it up is the inspirational, gospel-infused &quot;Act Of Contrition&quot; 2:19. When will the music industry wake up and realise you can't get rid of someone who is that talented, smart, and driven; motivated? Enjoy!
B00002E23E|3.0|Robert Plant and Jimmy Page were always somewhat disappointed with The Song Remains the Same, and it's not hard to see why...Some choppy and grainy video, not the highest-fidelity sound and certainly not one of their best live performances. But still, even Led Zep in a mediocre format is still 10 times better than just about anybody else out there. This is a also a great disc for younger Zeppelin fans to get a sense of what this band was like, including how crazy-huge they were, in their day.<br />I actually like the cheesy shorts in this movie. It fits the mood of the time to a T, and they are funny besides.
0064407667|5.0|What happens within this story does indeed seem tragic but &quot;Lemony Snicket&quot; style of writing will so captivate you that you will want to read this book cover to cover to your children or take it upon yourself to read it. The Story of Klaus, Violet, and Sonny does indeed have moments of 'extremely unpleasantness.' Such as their life with Count Olaf yet even through that you will continue to be unalbe to put down this book. I must have read this about 5 times and am reading it again, this is one book you should not miss.
6305546789|5.0|&quot;You can`t kill the boogey man&quot;. That`s what little Tommy Doyle says in the movie; and it`s true. &quot;Halloween&quot; has survived with style the test of time, and is truly one of the best horror movies ever.With their limited budget, John Carpenter and Debra Hill have done an excellent job in creating suspense, chills, and terror in this classic masterpiece.<br />The plot of the film is simple. Six year old Michael Myers brutally murders his older sister on Halloween night, and is locked in a mental institution for 15 years...until he manages to escape and bring the small town of Haddonfield in danger once again.<br />The main actors of the film are Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis, both of which do a fantastic job. The factor that struck me most in this film, however, is its creepy, gothic soundtrack which is played brilliantly on and on throughout the whole movie; thus creating a good amount of suspense.<br />The only critisicm I have to make towards this film is the fact that Michael`s face is revealed for just a second in the later part of the movie. This undoubtly blew away much of the mystique sorrounding the maniac killer. Other than that, I recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies. Forget &quot;Scream&quot; or &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;. this is truly the creme de la creme of terror.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This CD is unbeliveable... I usually save my 5 stars for Stanid cd's but Nickelback is my second favorite group... &quot;The State&quot; was awesome but i think this CD is better... Buy this Today!!
B00003CXS4|4.0|I saw this in the theaters and rented it a few times I really enjoyed it, brad pit is hilarious as a piker. I think that if you haven't seen it you are missing out but don't watch it to many times or you will lose interest. good the first and second time but isn't as appealing the third and forth.
B00005NOOH|5.0|For History buffs and those who have a keen, deeply felt interest in World War II beyond just the military events, the World at War, produced by Thames Television (1981) and released earlier on VHS by Thorn/EMI, is a 26 episode documentary set apart from all other documentaries about WWII. No other, with the exception of Walter Cronkite's CBS series, comes close to an unbiased, analytical perspective of a War that cost perhaps 50 million lives and took an emotional and philosophical toll we are still trying to comprehend today.<br />Narrated by Sir Laurence Olivier and covering all aspects of the war, this definitive series is used by many colleges and universities as a source for History and Documentary Film courses. There is an incredible depth of archive footage used; skilfully woven with interviews of major figures in the War from Britain, US, Canada, Europe and Japan. Many major eye-witness leaders and ordinary people who were still alive in 1981 contributed sometimes surprising, sometimes incredible, and sometimes haunting interviews. Yet, for all its skilful editing and historical sophistication, it is clearly presented and emotionally compelling. In my opinion, it is, along with Kenneth Clark's &quot;Civilisation&quot;, the best ever produced British documentary.<br />What makes this a stellar and overpowering account of the War is Olivier's narration. Never blustery, patriotic, or theatrical, Sir Laurence delivers pointed, thoughtful analysis with his incredible command of English and oration. Music for the series was composed by Carl Davis and even the opening credits set an unforgettable tone in a haunting image of a child in a photograph, dissolving in flames. This series is for those trying to make sense of a 6 year period when the world went mad. Five Stars PLUS.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|The first couple times thru this cd I was amazed. It was as though Bob had found the fountain of youth.The first thing it reminded me of was Blonde on Blonde. The energy, the wit, and the razor sharp lyrics were all there. I'm a dylan fan, but alot of his work (time out of mind is a fine example),is sort of like reading shakespeare. You know it's \\"great\\" but it's hard to enjoy. Heavy, deep but not much fun. Love and Theft is as great as any dylan and on top of that it's a joy to listen to. The band cooks,the songs go from rocking to catchy to beautiful. You don't have to sit in the dark and concentate to \\"get\\" it.(It will work that way too!)<BR>I honestly can't believe he did it. I wonder what the Grammys will do about this. This cd is clearly better than TOOM. Six stars.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I think it must be something in the water over in Iceland.  First Bjork, now Sigur Ros.  I first heard of this band on MTV2.  What really caught my attention was their first video release.  It is simply gorgeous and eery at the same time.  This album is proof positive that music is the ultimate communicator; the entire cd is sung in Icelandic and even though I don't understand what they're saying, I feel in my heart what they are trying to say.  I must admit that I only get past the 5th song and then I'll lulled to sleep by this amazing cd.  If you like Radiohead or any other emo-rock/alternative bands, I highly suggest Sigur Ros to you.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|My God!!  I have been a Dylan fan since about 1967, and have followed relentlessly (and often with disappointment as the decades have gone by)...  But, the journey has been worth it!  I don't know where to start:  the music, the words, the day of the album's release, the eerie forecasts in some of his lyrics...  <br />I decided to open the CD case, and give it a listen.  After \\"Time Out of Mind\\" and his constant touring since that album's release, it was clear he was placing a long distance call to his muse.  But little did I realize how deeply his muse must have penetrated him to his core, his soul... <br />This is the most vital, inventive, lyrical, bluesy, swingy, rocking, and clearly-enunciated recording I have ever heard by any \\"rock\\" musician, bar none.  As much as I admired \\"Time Out of Mind,\\" this is at a whole new level.  On \\"Love and Theft,\\" Dylan has shed the \\"trying to get to heaven\\" and \\"love sick\\" despair of growing old, the weariness of life, the almost gloomy view of life and love.  Instead, he had found a new lease on life, shed one more layer of skin, and redefined what rock music is.<br />Each song is a story, full of incredible characters, startling vignettes, awesome imagery, full of hope, and suffused with gloom (Lonesome Day Blues, High Water), black humor (Sugar Baby, Mississippi), and self-deprecating wit (\\"I've been in trouble since I put my suitcase down\\").  It is as if the man was born of whole cloth.<br />Rolling Stone, in giving this CD 5 stars, called it a masterpiece.  Even that is an understatement.  What anyone can say about it is an understatement... This recording redefines rock music.
B000050XEI|5.0|In height of all that has happened in the United States recently, this album work by Enya has helped to carry me through emotionally. This album is one of her best works - in addition to being filled to the brim with emotion, she captures this hymnotic mood to her melodies that just captures the listener. I feel safe listening to her soothing voice. <BR>Track #3, &quot;Only Time&quot; is the track featured on the &quot;Sweet November&quot; soundtrack, as well as the track that has been portrayed on the Friend's seasons premier commercial with Monica and Chandler's wedding. It also is the track that many broadcast networks are using as a backdrop for coverage photos of the aftermath in NYC and D.C.<BR>I doubt anyone would be disappointed by this album. It's emotional and it lifts spirits. Enya's voice is comfort.
6305657947|4.0|To all the technical nay sayers out there with their whining<br />&quot;you cannot fold a painting&quot; and &quot;you cannot wash oils off with<br />water&quot; I have but one thing to say and that is - stop already.<br />If you see ANY movie and you hold some serious professional<br />knowledge about the stuff going on on the screen, THEY ALWAYS<br />ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS GET IT WRONG!!! That is a given. For me<br />as a telecommunications engineer, that reveleation came with<br />&quot;The Long Kiss Goddnight&quot; and in &quot;A Clear And Present Danger&quot;.<br />So that being said, I take a huge chunk of disbelief and<br />remembering that it is a movie ( so technically always flawed ),<br />I have to say that I enjoyed this movie immensely.<br />Renee Russo is so good and her scenes with Brosnan zing off the<br />screen. I can only say that those reviewers stating there is<br />no chemistry between Ms Russo and Mr Brosnan would probably not<br />find any chemistry between potassium metal and water either.<br />And damn! When Ms Russo is on the screen, it is a wonder that<br />the screen does not melt. I cannot remember a movie in recent<br />years in which any female character has been dressed so sexily.<br />She simply radiates confidence and ability - both professionally<br />and sexually. In fact though the love scenes in this movie are<br />by no means gratuitous nor offensive, Ms Russo shows all the<br />allure of her character while fully clothed.<br />&quot;Do you want to dance? Or do you want to dance?&quot;. Indeed.
0316777722|5.0|It truly takes a lot to make me laugh, but I learned not to read anything by David Sedaris in public. His skewed inside viewpoints of life are hilariously offbeat and ring true. So true, that you will be laughing out loud. Whether describing his amphetamine induced college \\"performance art\\" shenanigans or his childhood abuse by a speech therapist bent on taking glee in his curiously high-pitched lisp, Sedaris knocks you over with a literary feather laced with lead. Commentaries on New Yorkers, southerners or any other ethnic or regional folk are side-splittingly accurate. Always self-depracating, Sedaris is kind enough to include everyone in his hit-list of ridiculous human behavior. As a reference, David Sedaris' wack-job of a sister is also highlighted. It is no surprise that she went on to be a major contributor to Comedy Central's \\"Strangers With Candy\\". Don't be surprised however, if everyone you tell this book about has already read it.
B00005NZBN|5.0|well after waiting for a long time..i am totally delighted..it has humor..great little slices of Americana..takes you through the 20th's..to 2001 blues ..a real treasure for everyone..it's a true masterpiece ..his voice which is an acquired.taste..is what really holds the music together..the song and dance man has outdone himself..fantastic..rc
B000007O9L|5.0|Anyone who thinks the Stones are a flicker of their former selves hasn't heard this album. These modern re-recordings of some lesser-known gems from Mick and the boys sound incredible. The sound quality is outstanding and the talent of these rock legends is unmistakable. If you're a Stones fan, this is a must. If not, this CD will make one of you.
B000000H48|3.0|This is a follow up to the THEM album. Thankfully, this is actually listenable, with the guitar solos produced by Chris Tsangarides who would produce Judas Priest's classic PAINKILLER album the following year. AT THE GRAVES begins on an eeriely poignant note with spooky keyboard effects before King's screams and the raging guitars burst through. SLEEPLESS NIGHTS is a great track: top songwriting, musicianship &amp; production. A VISIT FROM THE DEAD is beautiful and melodic in the first half until the guitars change the mood completely. THE WEDDING DREAM, with it's deranged wedding march will chill your blood, &quot;AMON&quot; BELONGS TO &quot;THEM&quot; is a stomping S.O.B of a track while the melody and eerieness merge on the instrumental SOMETHING WIERD. VICTIMISED combines the best of both worlds, whil the album ends nicely with the repetitive riffery of the inrumental CREMATION before King's last chilling words. Good stuff,but not up there with DON'T BREAK THE OATH. But what album ever will be?
B00003CXWV|4.0|Ok, maybe my review title ain't all that accurate. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this movie immensely.<br />Its not perfect, treats some of the subject matter a little more patly than I would have liked. You would think a movie like this would be a film about the coke industry of the 70s and 80s. Instead, the film is a tragedy, Jung's meteoric rise to fame and fortune, his crash and burn, his numerous attempts to right himself, his numerous failures.<br />You wouldn't know it going into it, but this film is about a man (albeit through some illegal, immoral, and unethical means) trying to provide for his family. Don't go into this looking for the next &quot;GoodFellas&quot; or &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;. It's a single-man character study, and as such (IMHO) succeeds admirably.<br />The ending of the film still haunts me.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|The concept of this movie is a very interesting one. You follow the daily life of the main character who is unable to sustain any short-term memories, but he still has his long-term memory. So he lovingly remembers the wife he lost and how he lost her. He lives on a quest to find and kill her attacker. Unfortunately he can't remember any details in the present and thus takes Polaroid pictures and writes himself notes about people and places. There are some characters in this movie who take advantage of his weaknesses and exploit him. Also, this movie starts at the end and works its way backward in time to the beginning. It was a little disconcerting. Though it was interesting for the first half of the movie, it began to lack substance from there on. In the end, is was thoroughly unsatisfying.<br /><br />One side note: of my friends who have seen this movie, more of the men liked it -- even loved it.  Most of the women didn't like it.  It's most definitely not a \\"chick flick\\"
B00003CXZ4|4.0|I'm not going to bother reviewing the film, except to say &quot;I love this movie&quot;.<br />I will say this about the DVD and it's presentation. Lackluster at best. Sure, they threw in a couple of trailers, an interview with the writer/director, the short-story text, and &quot;interactive motion menus&quot;. Bah!<br />This movie, being the classic that it is, DEMANDS so much more.<br /><br />Like what, you ask?<br />1) How about an option that would play the film in chronological order?<br />2) (MINOR SPOILER&lt; - This won't make much sense to you unless you've seen the film) Full, indepth explication of the &quot;Sammy Jankis - Leonard Shelby&quot; connection. Maybe the director taking us through HIS opinion(some of us are kind of stupid and may not take the hint).<br />3) How about some commentary?<br />I hope the Criterion Collection edition (if one is forthcoming) has a bit more for us &quot;Memento&quot; fanboys.<br />This movie is a must-have for anyone that appreciates fine film.
0425170349|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Best book i have ever read.... i havnt read very many books but hey..<BR>It was very enjoyable reccomended !
B00005BJPO|5.0|Just being a fanboy and reiterating what a great film this is. A landmark of anime-tion. Great extras. Would have been nice to have some voiceover commentary. Of course, that commentary would need it's own translation, no?<br />If you can find the Tin edition of Akira....buy it, immediately. A sure-fire collectors item. Already, used tins are selling for more than original purchase price.<br />And they ain't making any more of them.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie requires repeated viewing and pondering afterwards to &quot;really&quot; understand it. That is why we &quot;buy&quot; DVDs instead of just watching in the movie theater, isn't it? Moreover, there are a couple of scenes that actually requires the viewer to pause or put it in slow motion -- those scenes are rather creepy, realizing what kind of brain games that the writer/director Chris Nolan wanted to play! I didn't realize this particular scene until my 4th viewing, but darn it, it was brilliant!
0316777722|5.0|I crankily believe that 90% of modern American pop culture is generated by the same six people. Davis Sedaris is not, thankfully, one of those people. His book is so weird and unpredictable that I found myself alternately gasping and giggling throughout the short time in which I devoured it. <BR>    I too spent my childhood in NC and had that delicious, goofy &quot;HEY! I'VE BEEN THERE!&quot; reaction when he mentioned places like Greensboro and the Raleigh Art Museum, and when he commented that his speech teacher thought &quot;pen&quot; was a two-syllable word. I am also a former student of French, a sometime participant in odd theater pieces, and blessed(?) with a remarkably peculiar family. Therefore my laughs were that much louder because of the classic &quot;It's funny because it's true!&quot;  principle of comedy. <BR>         In the Seinfeld era of mass-produced catchphrases, I appreciate Sedaris' dry and inventive manipulation of language.  Several of his turns of phrase have already wormed their way in to my daily conversation. I have begun to nurture my inner vachette. I would like to personally thank the author for writing the phrase &quot;I was sitting at home, braiding the bristles on my whisk broom&quot; because it is the most inexplicably hilarious image I've encountered in a long time.  It's funny because it's true. Most of us are really that weird.
B000059MEK|4.0|The main reason I bought this disc was for the the four tracks &quot;One More Time&quot;, &quot;Aerodynamic&quot;, &quot;Digital Love&quot; and &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; because they had animation directed by Leiji Matsumoto (Starblazers) and sound extremely great. The other songs fit into classic techno and eerie techno. &quot;Crescendolls&quot; was a great song that I recommend using at parties a lot. Among other things, &quot;Superheroes&quot; is a very pulse pounding song and &quot;High Life&quot; sounds like a remixed song of the 70's. Songs like &quot;Nightvision&quot; and &quot;Verdis Quo&quot; are very slow and quiet songs prooving even techno can be easy listening. Thats what I love about what Daft Punk did with this disc. It took risks trying some new techniques and some that other bands are afraid to touch. They use voices as actual music by manipulating it and even add some distortion affects that you might have noticed in some old PC games. However, if you were a big fan of Homework, I would suggest listening to a few tracks. And I would recommend staying away from the last two songs on the disc. They're just lengthy lyrical tracks. Still, Discovery is one hell of a fun techno experimental CD to listen to. Its nice to hear something new in a world with nothing but lyrical rap and pop.
B000002HPT|5.0|This is a great cd some people say it sounds like pop but it really is great sure theres alotta slow songs but there good slow songs theyre not boring so its great everything buy it
B00005NOZ6|4.0|This is just a CD version of the DVD. I was not impressed with the sound quality of the DVD, but the sound quality of this cd is spectacular. They include a couple of songs that were not included on the DVD like a section of &quot;Acid Rain&quot; and &quot;The Mirror.&quot; This is Dream Theater at their best. LaBrie has a difficult time hitting the extreme high notes, but its ok. You might want to buy it now (if you are a collector) because they might change the cover- the cover includes the two WTC buildings. Some stores have already taken it off the shelves because of the title- its pretty scary. Its more scary to think that the release date was moved forward to this date. Anyway, this is a great CD and is a must for any Dream Theater fan.
B00005J6UP|5.0|The story of Goonies takes you on a wild adventure (treasure hunting) with a bunch of kids to save their homes from been bought over by some rich tycoon. You won't find fantastic special effects in this movie, just typical fun and adventure any kid can dream of. If you miss your childhood days (which I do), I bet you will enjoy this movie very much! One of the magic of this movie is the memory of my childhood years that returns while I was watching it.<br />As for the DVD itself, you will find loads of extras. There's the MTV, deleted scences, etc. I just love the commentary by the director and the then kid actors who have all grown into fine adults. The commentary will tell you both the fun and hardship the actors went through while shooting Goonies.<br />If you like simple adventure movies, I recommend this one to you.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Jack lemmon has this undeniable presence that just draws you into what ever role he played! He Just fit into this every man magic that it seemed as if a hidden camera is placed into his real life situations and we are allowed to observe. This quality trancends acting this just is Jack Lemmon, he never was an actor he was just a genius! The Apartment gives him the ultimate setup and sceneray to chew on and he rips into like a beaver attacking a sequoia! The film places him in the midst of being the ultimate underdog, he goes to work everyday to earn a living and returns home to his home life, one that he lives alone but even his home life is over run by those who have more power than him his co-workers at work. The higher ups use his apartment for rendevous and at times demand the key to his place, leaving lemmon no choice but to sleep on a park bench on a rainy moonlit night. But why does Lemmon put up with being the ultimate punching bag? Why do any of us? Because we have to survive and bite the bullet but as the film progresses and we meet the ultimate swine played to perfection by MacMurray and falls in love with Shirley MacLaine his reolve is tested and he breaks and when the plot spins from haate to love to suicide to friendship and back to love you never ever loose faith in Jack Lemmon you never doubt him or think of him as being weak or shallow because he is not Lemmon's character is the ultimate creation, the force of all great films, he is everyone! As the film went on I didn't find myself rooting for him to get the girl, or to get a great job or to even get even with those who have broken his spirit i just wanted Lemmon's Charater C.C. Baxter to be happy!
0767814037|5.0|I love this movie..It's about 4 men who end up meeting and saving each others lives on their way to Silverado..There's killin' and great Saloon scenes and 1 really funny scene with Scott Glenn running through some theives hide out..U will really enjoy this cowboy flick..
B00003CWL6|5.0|When American Beauty came out on DVD i was very hesitant to buy it because i prefare British movies but this one of the few films i agree with the critics. Kevin Spacey is excellent as 40 something Lester Burnham from the begining i felt for poor Lester (his anology of the after life is my favourite part of any film ever). As gets persucuted from by his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and his Daughter Laura (Thora Birch) for daring to revolt against his &quot;normal&quot; suberban life.His revolt begins one night when he goes to see lauras cheerleading group(my second favourite part of the film) he meets Angela (Mena Suvari)lauras best friend and they both change each others lives when Angela realises she has feelings for lester. One of the stangest characters is the Burnhams new next door neighbours particulary there son the drug dealer who spies on Laura and ends up selling Lester Drugs. This Has to be regarded as the greatest fim of the 1990's mainly due to the emotional performances from Spacey and Suvari and if there is a dry eye win the last 20 mins your more manly then i am i have seen it at least 10 times and i always end up crying in the end 20 mins. So i would like to congralulate Sam Mandes on a superb film which is both funny and emotional something hard to do nowadays.Kevin Spacey on been in my opinion been my favouite male character out of any film and finally Mena Suvari who is my favourite hollywood babe and her character is the best piece of acting by a woman in any film. So in conclusion go buy this film it will be the best purchase youve ever made . Thank You.
6305678707|5.0|I've seen this film about 20 times and I still love it. The terrific scenery of San Francisco is just one element of a &quot;thinking person's&quot; action film.  A movie with a brain. And, probably Meg Ryan's best performance on film. Mark Harmon and Connery are perfectly cast and the script is intelligent and fascinating. I love this movie.
0451163540|4.0|Ken Follett is one of the best &quot;bestseller&quot; authors around. And he's versatile--check out Pillars of the Earth, which couldn't be more different than this book, Triple.<br />Triple centers on Nat Dickstein, who is working for the Israelis with the seemingly impossible task of stealing a sizable amount of uranium. Dickstein's exceedingly clever plan keeps you turning the pages, as do the counter-efforts of the Russians and Arab agents who want to derail his plan. The main characters are well-developed and multi-sided--and the &quot;bad guys&quot; are not just cookie-cutter heavies--they have their sympathetic side as well. Which, I think, is what kept me from putting the book down until I finished it. Great reading for a vacation, trip or just relaxation.
B000003BEM|5.0|This is classic rock, sure, but that don't mean its good.  There's good classic rock, like Barry Manilow, Air Supply, The Carpenters and Herman's Hermits.  Buy those bands if you want good classik rock!!  Also, support The Bengals, there the best football team ever.  Go bengals, who-dey!!!
B000001FZK|5.0|This is the musical equivalent for those elusive and unexpected moments where one's sense of solitude implodes, yet at the same time somehow dissolves unvieling a space within more expansive, beautiful, and rich with secrets but also struggles.
B00005NZBN|5.0|This album is a must have by any music fan.<BR>I like the song Floater (too much to ask) the song is just [cool]. Dylan at 60 sounds great. This album should earn more Grammy awards then Time Out of Mind. Anybody who listens to it will absolutely love it...
B00005NZBN|5.0|No, this isn't Dylan's most personal (that would be Blood on the Tracks) his most energetic (Live 1966) or mysterious (The Basement Tapes or perhaps Time Out of Mind), but Love and Theft's twelve songs show Dylan at his most varied, in an astonishing mix of electric and country blues, twenties pop, fifties rhythm and blues, and sixties Highway 61-style rock, all performed with a maturity and humor that carries the music to the highest level.<br />Love and Theft is Dylan's first album recorded with his current touring band, certainly the finest he's worked with since The Band.   <br />This is the first great rock record of the decade.<br />It's worth mentioning that the limited edition contains two tracks recorded in '61 and '63, &quot;I Was Young When I Left Home,&quot; and &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin'&quot; (an alternate take), well worth the few extra dollars.   <br />If you care about Dylan at all, this one's essential.<br />Thanks, Bob.  I needed it.
0060934913|5.0|<br /><BR>What an author!  Bourdain's prose style is elegant, and his comic timing is absolutely marvelous.   As a long-ago resort restaurant employee, I know that much of what he writes is true, but he still gave me some surprising information.  For instance, I like his Tuesday night restaurant suggestion.  And mussels?  Though I love them, I'll never order them blindly again, unless I know how they have been prepared.  Fortunately, they're a breeze to make at home, so that shouldn't be a problem.  Bourdain writes like a veteran, and makes you feel like a restaurant insider.  His stories about &quot;Bigfoot&quot; (most feared/loved/loathed/admired restaurant boss) are priceless.

B00004SVGE|5.0|Diana Krall will be viewed as one of the greats years from now. The rendition of &quot;peel me a grape&quot;, is lush and sexy. Her style on some of the classics, like How Deep is the Ocean is unique and brings another feeling from the song, than heard by other artists who've recorded it.  The songs are romantic, smooth, and mood setting for an evening of cheek to cheek dancing.

B00000I950|5.0|I've heard Waterloo, I've heard Ring Ring, I've even heard The Album, but none of them have kept my CD player on repeat as long as Voulez-Vouz. From the the funky As Good As New, to the relaxing Chiquitita, to the all-time ...shaking hand-clapping Voulez-Vouz and the groovy Does Your Mother Know, this was the swedish pop phenomenon's best. I don't know how I discovered Abba, all I know I was going through some boxes in the garage looking for some video game stuff, I uncovered a box of old tapes. I found a tape with a faded cover with a strange word on it that had a backwards B. I decided to pause my search and play the tape, because it had a picture of two pretty women and two handome men on the front. After popping it into my stereo, I heard a string section playing followed by a groovy beat. I looked at the back of the box to see what the name of the song was, and it said \\"As Good As New\\". And then after listening to the song once I rewinded the tape, started it again, and started dancing to the irresistible beat of As Good As New. I later learned that the tape was not an Abba album, it was some strange Abba bootleg mix from Egypt (I later realized that because it didn't have Voulez-Vouz or Does Your Mother Know on it), which is easy to understand beacuse that's where my dad grew up in the 70's and 80's. Since the tape was so old the sound quality was really bad, and I longed for it on CD. And until about a week ago my dream came true. I walked into a Tower Records store in Harvard Square (which is in Massachusetts) with my dad, and I went over to the computer database thing and typed in \\"AS GOOD AS NEW\\". I hit enter, and suddlenly a big list of songs with the title As Good As New appeared. I clicked on the one that said \\"ABBA\\" next to it, and on the screen it said \\"AS GOOD AS NEW- ALBUM-VOULEZ-VOUZ- ARTIST-ABBA\\" I ran over to the Abba section, went through the CDs, and pulled out Voulez-Vouz. I ran over to my dad with the disc in my hand and begged him to buy itfor me, and he agreed. And so in the car I was holding a little bag with Voulez-Vouz inside, and some (heh heh) Beatles Cds. I kept thinking, \\"I've got As Good As New on CD at last!!\\" As Good As New was the only reason I got the CD, but I didn't care. When we got home I put the bag on the table, and took out Voulez-Vouz, leaving the (heh heh) Beatles Cds inside. I put the disc into my CD player, and immediately began grooving to the sweet sounds of As Good As New, and after playing and dancing to it three times I sat down on my bed, out of breath. I decide to let the CD run so I could hear the other songs, and not making myself feel guilty for making my dad pay ... for one song. After hearing As Good As New again, something made me jump off the bed and begin dancing to the super disco beats of Voulez-Vouz. When Voulez-Vouz was finished (I played it 5 times) I made myself promise to let the CD run without repeating a song, unless of an emergency. It turns out I had one more emergency, this time with Does Your Mother Know. After playing it twice, I thouroughly enjoyed every other song on the album, with the exception of I Have A Dream. Since then I have copied As Good As New and  Voulez-Vouz into my MP3 player, and have listened to them on a daily basis. So, this ends my review. But if you haven't got this gem, GET IT NOW!!
B00000JCOV|4.0|When i bought this cd i had never heard slipknot before and after i had listened to it a couple of times it became one of my favorite cds. isnt as good as Iowa(new one) though. It is a combination of metal and occasionally hip-hop. If you dont already have it might wanna buy it. the reason i gave this four stars is because all the songs are good and they are all different.
0780622650|1.0|...It is without question the WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN... The plot was dumb, the movie was too long, the special effects weren't very good, and the acting was atrocious. A cigar store indian could have added more depth to Matt LeBlanc's role, Gary Oldham (normally a wonderful actor) seems to sleepwalk through his part.  The script is so bad... <br />Nothing in this movie worked right on any level...
B00005JK99|5.0|This is, by far, the funniest movie ever made.  No question about it.  ...Even if you're new to Python, and there's nothing wrong with that, this movie is probably the best one to get started on.(\\"The Life of Brian\\" and \\"The Meaning of Life\\" are for extreme hardcore fans only.  They aren't funny at all.)  Every single skit in this movie is hilarious.  I mean, this movie will redefine how you think about comedy movies.  Every time you see a comedy from now<BR>on, you will use this movie as the standard of comparison.  John Cleese steals the show, playing roles ranging from the French taunter who launches farm animals from atop his castle, to the ever-quoted Black Knight(It's just a flesh wound!)  I'm not going to list off every single skit, because it would ruin it for people who haven't seen it yet.  Besides, you wouldn't know what I was talking about.  If you haven't seen this movie, see it NOW.  You will most likely enjoy it if you are a fan of British Comedy, or Mel Brooks movies such as \\"History of the World Part I\\" and \\"Young Frankenstein\\".
6305291489|5.0|I think this is one of the best family movies I have seen. I think Lindsay Lohan is adorable and amazingly talented. A must buy, collectors item.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Bob Dylan has a history that is known to all of us. What is great about him and this cd is that he has never stopped growing. I would have been easy for him to rest on his laurels as a legend but instead he continues to deepen his music. Love and Theft is a good example of this. It is so refreshing to see this kind of honesty present in the music business in all forms from India Aire's new cd to Soul Manifesto by Rodney Jones to Jill Scott to Love and Theft. Bob Dylan just keeps getting better.
B0000509BZ|5.0|This original highlander is the best of them all. Christopher Lambert (Connor MacLeod) made an excellent hero. Sean Connery's (Juan Ramirez) guest appearance was well recognized as well (in flashbacks). The movie revolves around a band of immortals who cannot die unless their head is cut from their body. They are done so in sword fight duels well done by both Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery. The evil immortal of the movie is The Kurgan (Clancy Brown), a Russian immortal seeking the prize through killing Connor MacLeod as well as becoming the last immortal. While the movie shows Connor and the kurgan dueling with immortals, we go through flashbacks to 1536 and 1542. 1536 was the date were Connor was viciously wounded by the Kurgan in the battle the MacLeods and the Kurgans. Miricously he was revived and believed to be a devil worshipper therefore driven away from his home, Glennfinnan, Scotland. He came to Glencoe to settle down and marry farm girl Heather. He was then founded by Ramirez and tought the ways of immortals. <BR>   More than 400 years later we are in Present day 1986, New York City, we're Connor MacLeod is running an antiques shop and falls in love with Brenda, a NYC cop who investigates the killing of a immortal done by Connor. Connor is founded by the Kurgan and challenging him. The fiery battle to claim the prize lies with in them. I recommend this movie.
B00005NWM3|2.0|Nickelback's sophomore effort is disappointing, to say the least. Their first, \\"The State,\\" was one of the best albums of 2000. The industrial/grunge combination blew Nickelback's competitors out of the water. And then came \\"Silver.\\" Nickelback decided to dump its industrial influences and go with metal/grunge, probably in an attempt to cash in on Staind's success, while at the same time essentially losing all its originality. After hearing \\"How You Remind Me,\\" the only great song on the album, I rushed out and bought \\"SSU\\" the day it was released on a whim. Never have I been more disappointed. These songs lack the power of \\"Breathe,\\" \\"Old Enough,\\" and \\"Worthy to Say,\\" songs from their debut album. Not to mention the riffs are drudgy and unoriginal. Stay away.
B000002X4T|5.0|I'm so glad to have re-discovered this gem.  It showcases Jefferson Airplane as the powerhouse band they were.  With four fine songwriters, and as many vocalists, they could pull off a variety of material all driven by the hot guitar/bass duo of Kaukonen and Casady (later, and now, Hot Tuna).<br />The song, &quot;Volunteers,&quot; is as stirring today as ever--the rhythm guitar, and Marty Balin's vocal both crackling with energy.<br />&quot;We Can Be Together&quot; has that unique meld of Slick and Kantner voices; and, with the underlying guitars is an archetype of the  Airplane sound.  It's also a precursor to the one outstanding (and one only) &quot;Starship&quot; album, &quot;Blows Against the Empire&quot; that followed this one.  &quot;Good Shepherd&quot; is my favorite Jorma Kaukonen song/arrangement--such a nice melody, contrasted with his jagged-edge guitar.  &quot;Turn My Life Down&quot; is another fine Kaukonen song with Balin vocal highlighted by a jam with Kaukonen on lead and Stephen Stills on Hammond organ.  <br />&quot;Wooden Ships&quot; is good performance here although it pales by comparison with the Crosby, Stills and Nash version. &quot;A Song for all Seasons&quot; is the one bad song and shouldn't have been included; but it doesn't mar the rest of a very strong album.  &quot;Meadowlands&quot; is a brief gothic-sounding organ piece which leads perfectly into the crunching guitar chords of &quot;Volunteers.&quot;
B000002INR|5.0|Warrant, Slaughter, Cinderella, Kix, Winger, etc. are the ones who gave bands like Skid Row and Motley Crue a bad name.  Skid Row does not fit the &quot;Hair Metal&quot; category at all.  They were much more raw than any of them.  Because of one two ballads (18 &amp; Life and I Remember You) they were labled as such. These songs are great though.  Skid Row is my third favorite band of all time.  Any so-called hair band that can intimidate Pantera on stage has got to be amazing!  Sebastian Bach has the best voice I have ever heard.  He holds notes better than most female R&amp;B singers and that is not an exaggeration.  My favorite songs on this are:  Youth Gone Wild, 18 &amp; Life, Midnight/Tornado, and I Remember You.  Buy this.
B00005LQ6S|4.0|This movie wasnt what i expected. But it was still good. This movie ignores the fact that highlander 2 and 3 ever happened. This is the only highlander movie that reflects upon both the first movie and the series. It revolves around and enemy, Jacob Kell (Bruce Payne) of Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) thought to be dead. Connor did not realize it but Kell is immortal. More than 400 years later we are in Present Day New York in the Sanctuary, a place where immortals are put in a form of protective circle. To be removed from the game forever. Connor is one of those mates. He is tired of the endless fight to survive. He is sustained with the memory of his mother's death and the death of Rachael, both done by Jacob Kell. Eventually, Kell and is band of immortals annihilate the sancturary except for Connor, who is let go. And now we are brought to London, England. Where Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul) receives visions of what is happening. He comes to New York to find Connor MacLeod alive, and a vastly enemy upon them. Although, this enemy is to strong, neither one of the Highlanders can beat him alone. <BR>This movie showed many scenes i saw in previews that i did not see in the theatrical version or in the All New Cut video version. There is a scene where you see Connor MacLeod swinging his sword through Jacob Kell's head and Jacob Kell splits into two. There is a scene where Connor MacLeods first sword. Is thrown at Jacob Kell but his hand moves up and it stops. There is a scene where you see both Highlanders jumping through a portal. There is a scene where you see Jacob Kell holding a glass with Connor MacLeods face in it screaming and Kell blows it away. These are all scenes seen in previews that are not seen in the theatrical version and video.
B00003CXXS|2.0|I cannot believe how putrid this movie is.  Yes, it had some great moments, but absolutly NO feeling!  Okay, The Lost World: Jurassic Park was a little tough to understand but the recipe that Spielberg uses is unsurpassed for these films.  I enjoyed believeing that these creatures were real and the human ideas of leaving these animals alone because we cannot control everything.  This movie just gives you action, special effects, and no story.  This movie is only 1 1/2 hours long, 30 minutes or more less than the first two.<BR>I work in Universal City and have been on many of the sets for JP2 and JPIII.  The sets are beautiful, the action is intense, the script is childish, and the score is grotesque.  I believe that Universal gave the audience what people wanted to see - Dinosaurs and action.  As long as people keep going to see movies like this then more sequels in this fashion will be made.  I don't mind sequels, but they need to be respectable so they can continue on a saga.<BR>I am a JP fan.  I do suggest seeing this film.  If you are a fan, you may never watch it again.  If you want action and explosive sound - You'll love it.
B00001OH7N|4.0|This is Bowie's first real foray into the dark side of human nature, which also marks the begining of his work with guitar legend, Mick Ronson. Released in 1970, it was a radical departure from &quot;Space Oddity&quot; which had a strong folk influence. &quot;The Man Who Sold The World&quot; has a heavy metal feel to it without the stupid, satanic horror schlock of Black Sabbath and the ilk that followed them.<br />What you get here is music from someone who had obviously read Nietsche and psychological texts. To put it country simple, it's metal with brains. &quot;The Width Of a Circle&quot; is a strong opener and what follows is one of the best songs in Bowie's early catalog: &quot;All The Madmen&quot;, which is based in part on David's brother Terry, who was institutionalized more than once. &quot;Black Country Rock&quot; is good, but not great. &quot;After All&quot; is just plain errie, with an almost funeral dirge chorus and a middle section that sounds like demented circus music. &quot;Running Gun Blues&quot; seems to be a comment not so much on war itself, but those few sick individuals who enjoy the killing. It's presented with a black humor that reminded me of the classic courtroom scene from the film &quot;Where's Poppa?&quot; In which Bernard Hughes rants about &quot;killing gooks&quot; to a stunned judge.<BR>&quot;Savior Machine&quot; is another fine track, concerned with runaway technology, and the title track is truly a masterpiece. I don't give the album 5 stars because of two tracks that just don't seem to work for me. &quot;She Shook Me Cold&quot;, and &quot;The Supermen&quot; just don't stack up the the quality of the rest here.<br />Bowie's work from 1969-73 is simply some of the best Rock music ever commited to tape and &quot;The Man Who Sold The World&quot; stands out well on it's own.
B000000WCA|4.0|many people think that the spice girls only do stupid-immature- pink-sticky but in this album they sure prove they don't. this is a great combination of pop, r&amp;b, disco, soul and funk. this album has EVERYTHING. you'll love it, no matter what's your favorite music type. it's hot, new, hype, and it's really good. you'll enjoy it, trust me.
B000055XMF|4.0|This film is unlike any other so-called Rock movie ever made. It has absolutlely none of the zaniness of A Hard Day's Night. It isn't filled with great music performances like Woodstock. It has none of the innocence of Beach Blanket Bingo. It is gritty, it is raw and sometimes it makes you feel very uncomfortable. In other words, it is rock and roll in all of it's glory. Great acting, fantastic staging and scenery, gritty real world color imagery, a blasting soundtrack featuring The Who or their songs re-recorded for the film. You will be mesmerized, fascinated and heartbroken, and in the end, ultimately perplexed. The film, unlike the album, fails to find redemption on the cliffs of the English shoreline and just sort of fades away. But that, in of itself, is a wonderful commentary on how fleeting and ephemeral the whole experience that is rock can be. One minute it's there, and maybe thirty thousand people are all locked in with the beat, then it is over and everyone sort of feels a little foolish and sad that the experience is over. But it is all about the experience, no matter how fleeting or delusional it may be. Rock is Dead, Long Live Rock!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Bought this on the afternoon of Sept. 11 and began listening on the commute home, etched in my mind the burning towers of the World Trade Center, and when I came to &quot;High Water&quot; and Dylan's ragged, wise lyrics, it all came together. I have been with Dylan since &quot;Talkin' New York&quot;, &quot;Gospel Plow&quot;, &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; and the rest on the first album 40 years ago, and now we have come full circle. He's older, he's wiser, he's simply brilliant, with a jauntiness and sage flippancy we haven't seen for some time.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I loved &quot;Du Hast&quot; the first time I heard the song. The music was loud and abrasive yet melodic like their German brethren the legendary KMFDM. &quot;Mutter&quot; quickly picks up where &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; leaves off but with better production and the inclusion of the strings in their brand of metal/industrial music. I love &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; but &quot;Mutter&quot; totally blew that album away. The songs are heavier,louder, and angrier. Considering the tone of mood in this country this past week, &quot;Mutter&quot; is an excellent album to vent out one's frustrations to the terrorists who crashed the WTC, Pentagon and in Pennsylvania. I may not understand a lick of German but I can certainly hear the angst filled throughout the entire album. I loved how the band incorporated a string section in songs like &quot;Spieluhr&quot; and &quot;Rein Raus&quot;. The string section and the thunderous raging industrial beats compliments each other I think. I am going to have to place &quot;Mutter&quot; as another favorite album of 2001. Just killer music.
B00003CXA2|5.0|For those of you who haven't already seen Forrest Gump, shame on you.  I won't even bother reviewing the movie, because it has been done by 197 other people on this site at the present.<br />What I will review is the 2nd disc of the DVD.  I was amazed to see how some of the shots and scenes came to be in Forrest Gump.  Such as when Tom Hanks had to go in front of a blue screen with X's on it to be able to nail the JFK/White House/Handshake scene.  The 2nd disc was worth the purchase of the DVD.  You will never watch the movie in the same fashion again after seeing it.<br />Oh, and the actual Movie isn't bad either! :-)
0688170528|5.0|I have recently become a fan of Jodi Picoult. I enjoy her stories and her writing---always very interesting and compelling. I ordered her older books after reading &quot;Plain Truth&quot;. And I'm so glad I did. <BR>This novel was gripping from the first page--I had a hard time putting it down. Having known &quot;kids&quot; who were very similar to Chris and Emily, I believe that I understood their feelings about their love, their being &quot;joined at the hip&quot;, the families being closely tied together. I also understood the painful reality of a young girl feeling so desperate that suicide would be the only way out of her pain.It was so real--and powerful to read. I couldn't put it down------except that I was reading it in the midst of our nation's terrible tragedy on Sept. 11---and found it was too painful to read about Emily's death when thousands of other deaths were happening in real life. I had to take a rest for a couple of days-----and finally finished it last night. A powerful ending to a tremendous story.<BR>I hope Jodi Picoult continues to write such terrific stories. She's one of my newest favorites and I'll continue to read her books.
B00005NW02|5.0|I don't like Metal.  Never did.  I assumed System of a Down was Metal, because of what I'd heard on the radio with Sugar, Spiders, and the newest release Chop Suey!.  Good thing I was mistaken.<br />This album is far from metal.. it's actually a brand of music I've never heard before.  They have a style all their own.  With brilliant lyrics, and somewhat of a political stance, System of a Down smashed a Home Run with Toxicity.  The album is incredible.  There are a lot of catchy guitar riffs, and a lot of the songs chorus' are equally as catchy.  This CD won't leave my CD player for quite awhile.
0440180295|5.0|Even as we find ourselves ready to enter another war and in the middle of the tragedies that occurred September 11, 2001, I remain strictly anti-war.  I do agree there is a time one must fight for what they believe in, but War is far from glorious.<BR><BR>Vonnegut does a wonderful job of relaying all of this to you.  What is most captivating about his style is how it flows so smoothly even if the main character can not remain in one time period.<BR><BR>The character in this book claims to have know aliens who have shown him that life never really ends for we all exists at the same time in many different times.  That they look at us as you would a mountain range, all at once, while we see only ourselves at this moment.  That in itself I found profound since it hints at us having no true free will.<BR><BR>This is a theme he touches upon often and I believe he feels that, not to sound cliché, our destinies are already written for us.<BR><BR>This leads to his character showing a deep degree of apathy for everything, including the horrible bombing of Dresden in WW2.BR>Especially because of where we find ourselves now, I truly feel everyone should read this book, it helped me see thing differently. I was literally reading this book while the World Trade and the Pentagon were hit by terrorists.  It helped me to turn to it, I am not as cold to things as the character, but somehow it offered a chilling calmness in his disregard for all that goes on.  So it goes.
B000001Y2U|5.0|like manson himself said, this is essentially a pop album.  which it is.  it's catchy, it's simple but it's very well-written.  i think part of the reason people think this album is so great is because of it's mystique.  at this time, manson was at the peak of his controversial thingy he had going.  everyone hated him or loved him and everyone was talking about him.  so that made this that much better.  but the music can stand on it's own even without the controversy, even though i feel it adds a lot.  no real music fan who knows what music is would really call this stuff metal.  it has a bit of a metal feel to it but everyone knows there's heavier and better stuff out there more deserving of the title.  and there's more controversial stuff to.  just look into anything death/black metal or gangsta rap or whatever.  there's worse stuff i know.  but i guess i should talk about the music at some point.  the music is catchy, the lyrics are well-written and every song has some sort of theme or feel or point that manson is trying to make.  in those respects every song stands on its own.  it's a weird thing to describe and i'm feeling lazy right now so i'll just say, if you like 'beautiful people', 'tourniquet', and 'deformography', there's no reason why you shouldn't like this.  if you don't, whatever.

B00000I0XW|2.0|This is my second Sarah Brightman CD, and probably will be my last.<br />After I bought &quot;Time to Say Goodbye,&quot; I told myself maybe that tiny, squeaky voice on that CD is an exception to her work rather than the rule. And I figured, besides, this CD is an operatic/classical work, Sarah Brightman should sound different on this CD.<br />Big mistake. The same small, squeaking voice. I just can't stand it. Barbara Streisand sings a MUCH richer version of &quot;Memory.&quot; Sarah Brightman's version simply cannot compare.
B000002UYZ|5.0|Recognizing the difficulty of assembling a compilation of Beatles hits, this album really surprised me.  It includes several hit singles (&quot;She Loves You,&quot; &quot;Love Me Do,&quot; &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot;) as well as several importantant album tracks (&quot;Yesterday,&quot; &quot;Drive My Car,&quot; &quot;Nowhere Man,&quot; &quot;Elanor Rigby&quot;).  For what you get, this is a good compilation, but if I were making the album, I would have hit a lot more hit songs that were missed in the compilation.  In fact, doing it my way, a triple album might be required.  I would have:  CD 1:  Love Me Do/I Saw Her Standing There/Twist And Shout/Please Please Me/From Me To You/She Loves You/I Want To Hold Your Hand/It Won't Be Long/All My Loving/I Want To Be Your Man/I Should Have Known Better/Things We Said Today/You Can't Do That/And I Love Her/Can't Buy Me Love.  CD 2:  A Hard Day's Night/I'm A Loser/ Baby's In Black/Eight Days A Week/I Feel Fine/She's A Woman/Ticket To Ride/Yesterday/Dizzie Miss Lizzie/You've Got To Hide Your Love Away/I'm Down.  CD 3:  Help!/Day Tripper/We Can Work It Out/Drive My Car/Norwegian Wood/The Word/Nowhere Man/Michelle/In My Life/Girl/If I Needed Someone/Paperback Writer/Elanor Rigby/I'm Only Sleeping/For No One/Yellow Submarine.  Well, even though so many hits are missing from the red album, it still represents the best of the Beatles from 1962-1966, so it's still a good buy.
0783227019|5.0|This is my favorite all-time movie.  Al Pacino and Sean Penn and excellent, and the directing by Brian Depalma is brillant.  Carlitos Way is a fast paced action/adventure film where the characters of the film are strongly developed.  Carlito Bergante is a strong willed, reformed individual in New York City whos past keeps coming back to haunt him as he trys to walk the straight and narrow.  I believe this to be Al Pacino's best film, and a timeless classic for all to enjoy!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|It is always dangerous to draw conclusions too early but I believe this album is one of his greatest and will burn itself into the minds of those who truly 'get it' when it comes to Bob Dylan. I'm one of those fans who felt that blonde on blonde was the greatest album ever -- measured by my urge to listen over and over and over. These were not ordinary 'songs' that grab you for a while and then become stale. These were emotional experiences to be repeated again and again. It is not just the words, or even primarily the words. It is the voice -- the incredible expressiveness and spontaneousness -- with the melody and phrasing specially tailored to fit the words and images of each line.<BR>My first listening to love and theft was disappointing as usual. First of all, it was not another blonde on blonde. Second, tweedle dee and tweedle dum?? -- give me a break! I thought, 'great ... another under the red sky'. Then came Mississippi -- well that song clearly has potential. Then some swing. I hate swing! But, guess what -- like all great Dylan works, you have to give it a little time and a few listenings to really know. Sometimes, as with under the red sky, the songs never seem to come around and get you.  But I'm getting the inkling that this is truly a masterpiece in the same category as blonde on blonde, blood on the tracks, highway 61 revisited, free wheelin, and subterranean homesick blues. I put it ahead of time out of mind -- in my view there are a too many 'skip-over'songs on that album -- and ahead of oh mercy, desire, and street legal.<BR>In terms of individual songs, the jury is still out on tweedle dee and tweedle dum but it may be growing on me. Mississippi, po boy, and sugar baby are all wonderful. As usual, it is the voice that makes the phrases so moving and memorable. Moonlight has Dylan actually singing melodically and it sounds great. Cry awhile, lonesome day blues, and high water are better than the blues numbers on time out of mind and part of why Ilike this one better. I'm not sure if summer days or bye and bye are ever going to blossom though -- may need to fast forward through them.<BR>I've been to two live concerts in the past few years and both were incredible. So I'm not surprised at how tight the music is. He clearly loves playing with his current band and it shows. Now if only he would have played some harmonica on a few cuts ....
B00005NZBN|3.0|the backing band is tight, the music is good, with the feel of 50s Hank Williams, Carl Perkins and others.  And most of the songs, especially &quot;Mississippi&quot; are among his best, which is saying a lot.  But the '60s Dylan voice needed maturity, the '70s voice was just right, the '80s voice was evolving, but the '90s-2001 voice has lost me.  Kind of like Tom Waits with a hangover and a head cold, after smoking his second pack of Marlboros for the day.  That's really the only reason I can't listen to Bob nowadays. Too bad, because the &quot;sound&quot; on his last two records is even better than that &quot;wild mercury sound&quot; he loved so much back on 1966's world tour.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Every Bob Dylan album, from his 1961 folk debut to this latest outing, has had a flavor all its own and distinct from previous releases. Like Neil Young, Dylan moves from one genre to another over the course of just two albums. From the explosive, blues/rock of Blonde on Blonde to the folky, serene John Wesley Harding, for instance, or from the spare and bitter folk classic, Blood on the Tracks, to the folk-pop extravaganza, Desire, released the very next year. Among the many trademarks that have become associated with Dylan over the years stands his knack for effacing past efforts with new, surprising experiments. Dylan's musical glance is always peering forward. Perhaps that is the quality of legends.<br />The poignantly titled &quot;Love and Theft&quot; is no stranger to that kind of resourcefulness. Yet, it is perhaps Dylan's most distinctive effort ever, as not only does the entire album command a sound all its own, but so does each song. The only track here that might remind one of the brilliant blues fest that was Time Out of Mind is &quot;Summer Days,&quot; whose rollicking, fifties flavor is reminiscent of &quot;Dirtroad Blues&quot; or, for that matter, &quot;Tombstone Blues&quot; or &quot;5 Believers.&quot; But while Dylan returns to his folk, blues and rock routes throughout the album, he also delves yet again into newer territory, and exerts a very confident hand upon the pastiche of styles that unfolds over the course of these 12 new songs.<br />Though Tom Waits's shadow lurks in the eerie and thunderous opener, Dylan then slips comfortably into the gorgeous, folk ballad, &quot;Mississippi.&quot; And while the lyrics throughout the album are usually melancholic, the music itself has been stripped of the gloom that pervades most Dylan efforts. Rather than sounding incongruous, the blending of loose musical arrangements with downtrodden lyrics produces a splendidly affective pathos. This is particularly evident on the wondrous &quot;Sugar Baby&quot; and the beautifully blue &quot;Mississippi.&quot;  Tunes such as &quot;Floater&quot; or &quot;Bye and Bye,&quot; a jazzy (yes, jazzy) waltz, would sound just right at the shampoo aisle of your local grocer. However, when Dylan's blade-sharp wit chimes in, as he marks his astonishment &quot;that I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,&quot; the song comes alive. This is the virtue of any artist with the lyrical prowess of a Bob Dylan, that they can invigorate the blandest melody with the wild flames of language.<br />&quot;Love and Theft&quot; has been billed as an album &quot;for the masses.&quot; Well, it is still Bob Dylan, still that voice that would make for a great anti-tobacco ad, but if this album really does have the capacity to contain multitudes, it is due to its stunning potpourri of styles and lyrical mastery. &quot;Love and theft&quot; confirms that Dylan's recent return to form and glory was no false dawn.d the beautifully blue &quot;Mississippi.&quot;  Tunes such as &quot;Floater&quot; or &quot;Bye and Bye,&quot; a jazzy (yes, jazzy) waltz, would sound just right at the shampoo aisle of your local grocer.

B00004XOLZ|5.0|Really, no words can describe this CD. It is the most tragic and beautiful collection of songs I have ever heard in my short life. Setting the mood with eerie opener 'Twilight' Antony and his Johnsons could not have got off to a better start. A dark song, with an echoing crescendo. 'Cripple and the Starfish' follows, and this would probably be my favourite. Just listen to it. Song three, 'Hitler in my Heart' has the most beautiful ending a song could ever have. I could go on, but do yourself a favour: Get the CD, turn the lights out, and lay down on the bed. And listen.

Here again is all the matchless songcraft, the wit, the unmistakable love for the great old American music that has marked all Dylan's great work. And all presented via some of his greatest-ever vocalising.<BR>Debate will doubtless rage about which of the 12 songs are `classics' and which `throwaways'. I think this is a feature of the album that makes it especially Dylanesque; what at first may sound like lesser-lights, on further listening reveal layers that make the songs much more. `Floater [Too Much To Ask]' is one such, with its wonderful evocative quality that has Huck and Jim at the tiller in my mind's eye. `Po' Boy' is another.<BR>But instant masterpieces there certainly are: listen to the way he sings `I crossed that riverrrrr...' on 'Mississippi', surely one of Dylan's greatest-ever vocals, to say nothing of the tremendous rhythm section. And when has he ever produced a more atmospheric track than `Highwater [for Charley Patton]' in which he manages to pay tribute to perhaps the greatest of all Delta bluesmen, not only by including his name in the title but by reference to several Patton classics [Highwater Everywhere Parts 1 &amp; 2, Shake It and Break It, High Sherrif Blues, for example] in the lyrics. Yet the song itself is nothing like anything Charley ever did. Rarely has there ever been so varied a Dylan album. Fans and scholars will yet again have a great time speculating on what Bob is doing here. `Concept album' is a phrase that will ring for sometime when this disc is discussed. None of us is a Michael Gray but that need not stop us throwing ideas around; here's one:<BR>In his liner notes for the album 'The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers:a tribute' 1997 CK 67676, Bob wrote:<BR>&quot;Jimmie Rodgers of course is one of the guiding lights of the 20th century whose way with song has always been an inspiration to those of us who followed the path. A blazing star whose sound was and remains the raw essence of individuality...his voice gives hope to the vanquished and humility to the mighty [NB 'I'm going to teach peace to the conquered/I'm going to tame the proud' - Lonesome Day Blues, from Love &amp; Theft]. He sings not only his bawdy, upbeat blues and railroading songs, but also tin pan alley trash and crooner lullabies as well. He is the Ringmaster General and is, as in the Warren Smith ballad, the man who 'held your hand and sang you a song'. What more could he do...Times change and don't change. The nature of humanity has stayed the same. Jimmie is at the heart of it all with a seriousness and humour which is bedfuddling.&quot;<BR>A thought that sparked a concept?<BR>Oh, and the 2 bonus tracks are great too.
B00005OWEH|5.0|This new version of Coppola's masterpiece is  more coherent than the previous one.At the same time,one finds in it a certain humor(the scene of the GI's encounter with the bunnies reminded me of M.A.S.H) and some erotic scenes which deeply modifies the film(it is no longer a &quot;males'film).<BR>Coppola has not done better ever since and unfortunately, few recent films have reached such a degree of achievement.But keep in mind that the film is not about the Viet-Nm war but about the decay of civilisation.It is therefore more than useful to watch this film now!

6305320802|3.0|This DVD is rated with a picture quality of 4 compared to Carousel with a picture quality of 3. I take strong exception to this and might want to give it a 2. Carousel was a much better picture quality. For example in the begiining of Oklahoma, when Curley is sing the &quot;Surrey with the Finge on Top&quot; you can see a target grid on his Red shirt as the image is panned. This is a very sloppy transfer even for non-anamorphic. I can only hope they will re-release it again in anamorphic format.

The succession of Mary's Protestant half-sister is feared, yet occurs.<br /><br />Henry VIII is dead and the country is divided. Catholic against Protestant. Elizabeth is portrayed at first as a woman of the world who takes great pleasure in playful, sensual dancing with her lover. She seems willing to take risks to be with the man she supposedly loves.<br /><br />After becoming Queen, she takes on such responsibility that she loses herself in her realm of power.<br /><br />\\"If you think to rule me, you are mistaken.\\" -Queen Elizabeth she tells \\"Joseph Fiennes\\" who was absolutely brilliant in this movie and every woman will just wish she was the one being persued so pationately.<br /><br />When she is still a Princess, she is accused of treason, this throws her into a world where evil men are consumed with the need for power and cloak their sins in a guise of piety.<br /><br />She sees the horrors and wants to make one church the rule. This is rated R mostly for violence and a few love scenes which are hardly a minute long. The torture scenes are rather awful and I wish they would have done away with all the heads on stakes, etc. However, they don't look \\"that\\" real.<br /><br />Through this movie you begin to really dislike Queen Elizabeth and as her heart freezes, so does yours. I am still wondering what her lover saw in her...she looks rather pasty in that makeup as if with her heart, her face lost all blood as well. ;><br /><br />Brilliantly acted by all and a royal feast for the eyes. The costumes are stunning and Joseph Fiennes is excellent in this movie.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B000001Y79|5.0|Before this CD came out ska music was mostly isolated in its popularity to California, and had a small following in other places.  Then along came No Doubt and kaboom, ska was launched into the public eye finally getting the recognition it deserved throughout the United States. Most modern ska bands can thank No Doubt for a good portion of their following because their fans probably owned the epic &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; at a time.
B00003CXP1|5.0|If you thought the sight of Jennifer Connelly getting it on naked with a ...(sexual toy) could never be repellent, then let me introduce you to a whole new experience...<br />And if the cinema reviews of \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" were agreed on two things, they were that it was stymied from the beginning by its outdated and unsubtle source material, and that the last twenty minutes are hard to watch and impossible to enjoy.<br />Yet what recommends the film is the fact that despite the stomach-churning closing sequences, it is not only compelling but impossible to tear yourself away from (and, incidentally, never as painful and unsettling as his debut \\"Pi\\"), and that despite its apparently two-dimensional moralising, it remains with you longer afterward than any film since perhaps \\"Magnolia.\\"<br />It is certainly a measure of Aronofsky's high-minded approach that although he has cinema's sexiest couple at his disposal in Connelly and Jared Leto, he never trades on their looks and the only nudity is non-sexual. Indeed one of his greatest achievements in the film is making the golden couple appear increasingly grotesque as their fall progresses. Connelly in particular echoes Roald Dahl's Mrs. Twit, whose ugly thoughts over time, you may recall, began to show on her face until she became so ugly you could hardly bear to look at her. But \\"The Twits\\" never did brave that ...(sexual toy) sequence...<br />All the lead performances are flawless, and Ellen Burstyn was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for her role as Leto's mother. When a director and actor come together so well you get infinitely memorable moments like Burstyn's beaky, wrinkled face peering with confusion around the room at the edge of a fish-eye lens. Horrible. What's most astonishing on viewing the film again, though, is that \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" clearly marks out Aronofsky as the natural successor to Stanley Kubrick (and isn't it nice that we had only to wait two years?), with his fastidious attentionto frame composition, his delight in colour, his careful use of a brilliant score, and of course, most tellingly, the sense of something missing in the heart region...<br />This brings us back to what the some didn't like about it, and with these concerns taken into account, the film itself probably only deserves four stars. I'm giving this package five though, as the DVD gives it a whole new dimension (though not the one the critics were looking for). The extras are simply the best I have ever seen on a single disc set, and, crucially, now you can program your DVD player to run the chapters backwards, and give the lovely Jennifer and Jared the happy ending they deserve.

0767817710|4.0|Leave it to Sam Raimi creator of Evil Dead and Army of Darkness to envision a western where men are so tough and grizzled they can light a match off another man's beard stubble. John Herod (Gene Hackman) presides over the wicked town of Redemption where he takes half of every dollar for himself in exchange for letting the rest of the town live.  Every year he holds a fastest draw contest where the meanest, the ugliest, the flashiest, and the fastest gunmen eliminate each other in a formal contest for prize money. Sharon Stone centerpieces as  female gunman Ellen who comes to town for the opportunity to take down Herod for what he done to her and her daddy. But the reason to relish the film is for its two dozen seedy gunmen who go by names like Scars, Ratsy, Charlie Moonlight, Zeb, Simp Dixon, and Bordello swell just to name a few. Each gunman has his own style. One likes to wipe poisoned horseradish on his bullets before a fight another keeps his gun in a camera. Pre-fame Russell Crowe appears as a hardcore killer turned pacifist preacher. DiCaprio plays &quot;the Kid&quot; who makes the women worry his pretty face might get damaged before every showdown. Like most Raimi films its all very much tongue in cheek and meant to make you laugh while trying to keep a very straight face. In some ways you wish he had become even more audacious. But Quick and the Dead is testosterone laden fun with a little leather clad estrogen farm at the helm for a bonus.

What is the unknown? What is the data? What conditions does the solution need to satisfy?<BR>2. Do you know a related problem? Look at the unknown and try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown. <BR>3. Can you restate the problem? Can you solve a part of the problem. <BR>4.

0790729407|4.0|While this is a tale of an Irish struggle for autonomy from perceived British tyranny. Michael Collins is a good primer into the mind of terrorists and worth viewing for people who want to understand why people do unthinkable things to make their point known.  Terrorism is the tool of people to weak to engage in a war yet desire to have their pain and anger acknowleged by the mighty. While on a much smaller scale, it Michael Collins gives a perspective that is relevant to todays events.  I thought about this movie many times since the Trade Center bombings.  The film does not sympathize with those who commit random acts of violence and Michael Collins pays a great price for breaking from the hardcore wing of the IRA to create a first step compromise.  The film is a good historical lesson, beautifully shot and is food for thought as we enter into our next epic chapter of American life.

It is the story of the famous General George Patton, one of the most successful and feared generals in WW2.  He believed in the glory of war and often quoted the classics, believing that he was reincarnated from some of history's most famous military leaders.  He cursed a lot and was, at the same time, deeply religious and there is no doubt that he cared about the men under his command. Relentless in battle, he believed in discipline and hated cowardice.  The press made a big thing about how he slapped a soldier who was crying, forcing Patton to make a public apology for that incident.<br />This was George C. Scott's greatest role and it is interesting to note that he refused his Academy Award for best actor because he did not feel himself to be in competition with other actors.  He was larger than life in every single scene of the 171 minute epic and came across as intended - stubborn and unlikable and a bit of a nut job.  I never could either admire or feel any empathy for him as a person although I was glad that he won the battles. However, in spite of the battle scenes as well as his frequent confrontations with authorities, I found myself bored.  Maybe this was because I knew that he would win the battles and therefore found little dramatic tension.  The video was much too long and I actually fell asleep several times.  I wanted to like the film better, but unfortunately couldn't.<br />I can't help thinking about the times in which this film hit the theaters. The Vietnam War was raging and there was a huge anti-war backlash.  Patton had to be considered the epitome of what was then called a &quot;hawk&quot; who raged about the glory of war in spite of the agony of the men who had fallen in battle.  This film was not just about WW2; it was about all war.  And it dared to glorify war itself without sugar coating it as fighting for what is right and mom's apple pie.  The appeal of the film was that it made people look at their own perceptions of war, a debate that was already on everyone's agenda.  Perhaps that it what made it so popular at the time.  It must have also played better on a big screen than my tiny TV. The film is important only for fans of war films, as it is a classic in that genre.  For all others, I can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.pie.

B00004XONN|5.0|None of you out there, besides 5-6 of you are real radiohad fans. It is dissapointing to see radiohead faithful to over analyze the band that they have come to love. People, where do you se the change, yes the sound is somehwat diferemnt, but do me a favor, listen to the beatles as well. Kid a and amnesiac came form pablo honey and the bends. The bends is the best album of all time and I refuse to sit hear and listen to these reviews about a band who has grown up, no changed. Listen to every radiohead release form Pablo Honey to the Lps all the way up to Amnesiac. Yes, the sound changes at some points, but the music remains the same, same melody, same voice same message. The guitars are no gone, they are just mixed with electronica,the rock sound isn't gone, they just rather be a little softer. And you may ask, yes where is that rock sound. Go buy the pyramid and knives out eps and listen to Transatlantic drawl and Cuttooth, rock has not died and radiohead will forever be radiohead.
B0000214F0|2.0|I will concentrate on the movie's historical accuracy (or its lack of it), since the previous reviews seem to either have overlooked it, or claimed that it is &quot;historically accurate&quot;, or on the opposite extreme, that it totally ignored history. <br />&quot;Caligula&quot; does have some merit from the historical point of view, surely already present in Gore Vidal's original script. It's also very weak in many points.<br />The bare events of Caligula's life and reign are actually quite accurate. It may surprise many viewers that most of the secondary characters - Emperor Tiberius, Senator Nerva, the praetorian prefect Macro, Tiberius's grandson and Caligula's rival for the succession Gemellus, Caesonia, Chaerea (who murdered Caligula), his sister Drusilla - were all historical and, as far as the facts have come down to us, their portrayal in &quot;Caligula&quot; was fairly accurate, at least according to some ancient authors.<br />Tiberius did retire to the island of Capri in his last years and did invite the elderly Nerva to join him there, and ancient authors do claim that he indulged in sexual perversions there. Nerva really committed suicide as shown in the movie.<br />The conversations between Caligula, Nerva and Tiberius, probably by Vidal, really reflect contemporary views and issues - for instance, the deification of Julius Caesar and Augustus, Tiberius's predecessors: Tiberius was totally cynical about the whole thing, whereas Caligula firmly believed it. Throughout the movie, many of Caligula's lines come straight from ancient authors.<br />On the other hand, Nerva's comment on Caligula's &quot;gift for logic&quot; seems to owe more to Camus than to ancient sources - still, a nice touch, I thought.<br />Tiberius's murder by Caligula and Macro, Caligula's removal of Macro and Gemellus, his incestuous relationship with Drusilla, her death, his marriage to Caesonia, her giving him a daughter, his increasing tyranny, his farcical invasion of Germany and attempted invasion of Britain, and his murder by his own guard - are all historical facts, and on the whole not too inaccurately shown in the movie.<br />On the other hand, the movie's biggest weaknesses from the historical point of view are (1) the way it *looks* and (2) the suggestion that Caligula's and Tiberius's depravity were somehow &quot;normal&quot;, part of Rome's &quot;decadence&quot;.<br />The sets and clothes all look more like something from a Fellini film than from ancient Rome. Tiberius's palace on Capri is perhaps the most unrealistic, along with that ship, and the execution machine - and countless details.<br />The clothes aren't very realistic, either. Romans were more casual about nudity than we are today, and I suppose that their clothes might reveal much some times. But I doubt that Roman ladies would be as casual about parading half-naked as portrayed in the movie (I mean in normal situations, not the sex scenes).<br />Moreover, it's simply not true that &quot;orgies&quot; such as that portrayed in the movie were common among the Roman upper classes. Actually adultery - also on the part of males - was an offense punishable by death, at least for the upper classes (this didn't cover prostitution). The vast majority of the Roman senatorial class would, and did, find behavior such as that of Tiberius and Caligula scandalous.<br />However, Caligula's in cognito wanderings through Rome after Drusilla's death give perhaps for the first time in a movie a good impression of what ancient Rome actually was at night - dangerous, dark, chaotic, where no person of means would venture without an armed escort.<br />I also enjoyed the glimpse of what an emperor's routine largely consisted of, with Tiberius and Caligula stamping their seal onto endless piles of official documents.<br />&quot;Caligula&quot; was obviously intended to be mainly a pornographic movie - Bob Guccione made sure of that. But it also, at some point, was intended to have a core of historical accuracy, which is why Gore Vidal was asked to write the script. <br />This core is still present in the movie, and it's not true that you don't learn anything of Roman history by watching it.<br />But of course, I know that that's not what most people will watch it for. So perhaps Guccione was right.
B0000549B0|5.0|great fun about a very tall bunny based on a play also about a very tall bunny
B0000028M7|5.0|A GREAT album, I would probably be called a &quot;poser&quot; for thinking this to be the best AIC album but it is. Not so much dark but great heavy riffs and catchy lyrics on Lane's great origional voice proves Alice to be one of the best grunge bands next to The Melvins and Mudhoney. From &quot;Them Bones&quot; to &quot;Godsmack&quot; it is already one of the best Grunge recordings ever but with &quot;Angry Chair&quot; and &quot;Would&quot; it just adds leaving the only track not incredibly amazing to be &quot;Hate to Feel.&quot; An incredible, must buy album for any grunge fan weather your a hardcore grunge fan or not.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|To me Rage Against The Machine have many characteristics that are outstanding. The fact that they use no artificial sounds and are clearly proud of the fact that all they use is guitars, drums and vocals (as stated on each of their albums). And the fact that they are against everything holding the public down. If you want a clearer insight into what they mean, I strongly advise you watch Fight Club first. <br />The sheer political content of the album is overwhelming, not to mention their closure of the stock exchange as a protest in the, &quot;Sleep now in the fire&quot; video. Another point is also how damn good a guitarist Tom Morrello is. Damn he's good. His solos are powerful and full of anger, this combined with De La Rocha's firey lyrics makes you want to start a little revolution of your own. Basically, the music is great, the sheer creativity of R.A.T.M knew no end until obviously, Zack De La Rocha left during their joint tour with the Beastie Boys.(&quot;Rhyme and Reason&quot;) Tracks that stand out are The first track &quot;Testify&quot; which instantly draws you in with its raw anger and the equally powerfull &quot;Calm Like A Bomb&quot;. Most obviously, &quot;Sleep Now In The Fire&quot; Is a clear favourite among fans. Listening to the lyrics of these songs is like listening to the leader of a militant group or even a poet with a cause to fight for. <br />If you really liten to what De La Rocha says: you may learn that you are not as free as you think you are, the message gets across clearly. which is why I have rated this album, as a success!
B00004XQP4|4.0|Being possibly their biggest fan, I picked this CD up the day it came out. When I had heard they were abandoning their punk roots, I had gotten a little nervous. After listening to this album the whole way through, however, I breathed a sigh of relief. I thought it was a great CD. It was all set to go above Dookie as my 2nd favorite Green Day album (nothing could surpass Nimrod).<BR>Unfortunately, unlike their other albums, this one does not get beter with repeated listenings. Their are GREAT songs on the CD (such as Blood, Sex and Booze, Waiting, Church on Sunday, and Minority) that you just can't get enough of. But there are also mediocre songs that almost seem to get worn out if you listen to them more than a couple of times, like Warning, Fashion Victim, or Misery (which is entirely too long for my tastes). <BR>Maybe I was just expecting too much after waiting three years for this album to come out. I'd still recommend this CD if you enjoy their music. Billie Joe's voice sounds the best it ever has on these songs, and they have some amazing lyrics. However, if you're new to the band, I would pick up any of their other CDs before this one.
B00003CXX8|1.0|How bad this movie is.<br />It's not just cheesy, it's also dumb. Just plain dumb. What happens when you get an intriguing plot, good actors, and cool sets? Oddly enough, you get a poorly acted, scripted, ridiculous film. <br />The plot is pretty good, although not in the least bit scary, as was advertised in the trailers. During the dramatic parts, I couldn't keep from laughing. It was hard to believe some people actually wanted us to be quiet - were they actually enjoying the film? The acting done by the man who plays Terry Glass is comical, not a reflection on him though - just the silly character. They try to keep you guessing, but I knew what was going on the moment I sat down (and I arrived late!)<br />Bottom line: Don't waste your money, like I did. At least see something midly enteraining, like 'The Musketeer', if you insist on seeing a bad movie this fall.
B000001FVL|5.0|I had already bought the four sigles released from this album (Video Kiled the Radio Star, Living in the Plastic Age, Clean Clean and Elstree) when I bought the album. This album is a recording both of the time and ahead of it's time. To me, it did not get the exposure and the success it deserved. This is the album that was the blueprint for ABC, The Art of Noise, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Asia and Seal.<br />OK, some tracks have not stood the test of time so well - Kid Dynamo and I Love You (Miss Robot) to name two, but take a listen to the wonderful Johnny on the Monorail, the poppy catchy tune of Living in the Plastic Age, or the classic Video Killed the Radio Star and who but the the owner of the hardest heart could help but fall in love with 'em? Elstree is quite simply, my favourite song of all time and the album the one I would make sure I would take if my house were on fire. It is my desert island disc! BUY IT!!!
B00003CXTG|2.0|If you want to really learn about what hapened in Pearl Harbor, then get yourself a copy of &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora.&quot; Otherwise, the only thing worth seeing in this movie is the segment dedicated to the actual attack on Pearl Harbor, for its realism and incredible effects. The acting was very poor, and the love story was for the most part pointless. Too bad that Cuba Gooding's role was so minor (a cook from the USS Arizona): he might have been able to save the movie, because Ben Affleck didn't.
B000053V7O|5.0|I find it curious that in all the reviews of &quot;Round Midnight&quot; that there is virtually no middle ground.  People either loved the movie (most) while others hated it.  I suspect those that didn't like the movie are devotees of fusion and fail to appreciate the jazz of the 1950's.  Gordon while not the &quot;topical&quot; character of the film, lived this story as an expatriated saxphonist.  He brings a reality to the picture that is lacking in similar ventures such as &quot;Bird&quot;.  While I think &quot;Bird&quot; is too an outstanding film, the reality of watching the music being created live is not there.  <br />This film shames efforts like &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; because of its stark reality.  There is no glossing over and memorializing Dale Turner in the movie.  He's there with all his warts for all the world to see.  This wasn't a star vehicle like &quot;Lady...&quot; was for Ross.  This may be the most honest film ever made.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is one of the greatest pieces of works of the 20th Century. The music and lyrics come together brilliantly to portray a journey through the human psyche riddled with temptation, fake Gods and insanity hence the title Dark Side of the Moon. <br />The whole story doesn't become apparent until the last words on the album &quot;...everything under the sun is in tune but the sun is eclipsed by the moon&quot; translated, for every good an evil will prevail, or another - good is sometimes well hidden. Essentially the album can be seen as one massive drug trip as well as a journey through good and bad. The heart beat getting louder and screams (Speak To Me) followed by sheer bliss (Breathe), which is a simulation of the initial hit from the stimulant. Then a sudden rush of disorientation portrayed by whirling electronic synth riffs (On The Run), showing a form of escapism from reality. Now the stimulant has the effect of taking you away from reality and Time appears to stop however in effect Time is going faster &quot;ticking away the moments that make up a dull day&quot; - Time. Breathe reprise is next, &quot;home home again, I like to be here when I can&quot; - which is talking about being able to relax and not to worry because you are high again (home referring to being high). The Great Gig In The Sky comes next, this has been described as a song about death and going to heaven, in drug terms it is about getting high and leaving touch with your body. Money - a song that is slightly out of place in music - it doesn't have that chilling effect that the other songs have but there is that excellent base riff and in a time signature of 5/4 that gives it its funky feeling. Back with the drug theme - the lyrics are very clever, change the word money with drugs, it fits in nicely. Us and Them - on the surface a song about war and a person in power commanding his troops into battle (Waters lost his father to war), when digging deeper its about the bad side of the stimulant fighting to take control of your mind and you coming to terms with the addiction. &quot;...and who knows which is which and who is who&quot; &quot;...it can't be helped there's a lot of it about.&quot; Now the full blown effects of the drug are taking complete control in Brain Damage, &quot;There's someone in my head but its not me&quot; the drug now has complete control and insanity has set in. Finally Eclipse &quot;and everything under the sun is in tune but the sun is eclipsed by the moon.&quot; This is about being in touch and in control with everything that is going on and trying to find reality.<br />An excellent album unsurpassed by any other bands, there are so many interesting hidden messages in DSOTM, a drug trip is just one of these. The music in itself is just breath taking and paints many landscapes with its spacey and chilled ambience. Gilmour is still one of the best on guitar - he brings out emotion with every note articulated. This is definitely one of those albums that is intellectually stimulating for philosophical people and to musicians, both will learn something from the Floyd. &quot; I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.&quot;
B00005M989|4.0|If you like Prince, this is a good collection of his hits. There are quite a few songs on the CD, so you will really get your money's worth. Too bad he tried to adopt &quot;The artist formerly known as...&quot; title. His best work is right here. He should have never deviated from what he produced.
B00005LB9O|5.0|The Invisble Band by Travis was and excellent buy. In my opinion the best tracks are Sing, Flowers in the Window, Last Train, Dear Diary, Indefinitly and The Humpty Dumpty Love Song. Side, Pipe Dreams, The Cage, Safe, Follow the Light, and Afterglow are also wonderful.  This album is much more mellow than the first two, Good Feeling and The Man Who. There is a calm, yet rocky quality to most of the songs, but some aren't very rocky at all. The lyrics are really great, and you can usually tell what is being said without reading the liner notes. Fran's falsetto suits the mood of the album very well. I recommend this to people who are already Travis fans, and people who like mellow melodic rock.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|&quot;Some things are just too terrible to be true.&quot;<BR>   In the context of recent events, have truer words ever been spoken?
B000002KDO|4.0|Perhaps it's because I own the Warner Bros. version of this album, but due to the bad production the songs sound layed back, even the heavy ones such as Sweet Leaf and Lord of this world. It's really too bad, the songs on here are incredible(I should get the Castle version).<br />You can trace most of the Sabbath influenced bands(too many to count) to this album, it's easy to see why with great rockers like Sweet Leaf and Into the void.  Those little interludes : Embryo and Orchid are pretty good, especially the guitars on the later, sounds midevil.  The band wasn't all about Satanic worship and sludgy guitars and they amazed us all when they wrote Solitude, a slow ballad wich takes you away to some distant palce in the back of your mind.  After forever contradicts the bad press the band was getting for the whole satanic thing(read the lyrics you'll see why).  My favorite track on here is the great Lord of this World, many bands have tried to cover it without success, the original is all you need.<br />Though Vol. 4 surpassed this album as far as song writing, it's still a great listen and very impressive lyric wise, Ozzy's lyrics get better with every album.  This was my introduction to the band and it only left me wanting more.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|If you like simple movies that tell simple stories, don't buy this movie.  You have to watch this movie from title to credits.  Just when I thought all original ideas in movies were gone, along comes &quot;Memento&quot;.  I saw it in the movies, and have watch the DVD at least three times.  Each time its like fresh air being pumped into my viewing experience.  While it had limited screening when released, it stayed on those screens a long time.  This may well develop a cult following.  However, it is not a film everyone will like.
B00004WEJZ|1.0|Sean Connery is without a doubt the best Bond ever. But by the time this movie was made, the formula which made him such was lost, and only recently has Pierce even come close. The movie follows the same basic formula as some of Moore's cheesiest bond titles (aka View to a Kill), using high tech gadgets and special effects to make up for a lack of panache and storyline. As has been said before, aim for Thunderball... the story is similar, but the classic bond flair and style are there. In truth there is no comparision
080017948X|5.0|Simply the best movie ever made.  Try to top it!!
B00000K19E|5.0|This is a great movie, especially for sci-fi lovers. What if the world we live in isn't real, but it's just a computer simulation created by violent machines in order to keep us calm while they secretly enslave us? No, I'm not crazy. This is the set-up for &quot;The Matrix,&quot; which cleverly twists reality. Mind-bending special effects add to the already clever, original plotline. Keanu Reeves, often a very underrated actor, stars a Neo, the possible savior of humankind from machine-enslavement. Laurence Fishburne, who sounds a lot like James Earl Jones as Darth Vader, is Morpheus, the leader of a group fighting the machines. Carrie-Anne Moss, in her first big Hollywood hit, scored big as Trinity, the female fighter aboard the ship/Neo's eventual love interest. All actors, who did most of their own stuntwork, pull of their characters better than most actors could manage in a film that highlights its flashy special effects. Have I mentioned that Keanu Reeves is great in this? Have I mentioned that he looks hot being great in this? Directed by the Wachowski brothers, &quot;The Matrix,&quot; along with all it's special features on DVD, will show you something you've never seen before, and make you think about something you've never thought about before. If nothing else, just sit and stare at Keanu Reeves for two hours.
B000002KE2|5.0|With todays music scene seriously dipping in quality, I've been doing what alot of people have been doing : going back in time and discovering the older bands such as Pink Floyd, King Crimson and my latest discovery Black Sabbath.<br />After Master of Reality, Black Sabbath had sort of backed themsleves into a corner.  The fans where in love the slow pounding sludge guitar that was Sabbath's trademark, Sabbath had begun to experiment a tiny bit on Master of Reality with tracks like After Forever and Solitude but that was just the beggining.  You see Vol.4 not only rocks harder than MOR it also beats it songwise.  This album grabs you by the kneck from beggining to end whereas Master of Reality was tough to get listen to at times not so here.  Another thing about this album is it's rocking power, it seems like the band let loose and went wild, Iommi's guitar is allowed to breathe, while on the last record it sounded layed back and so did the band.<br />The songs I most enjoy are Wheels of Confusion, Yesyerday's dream, Supernaut, Snowblind, Cornucopia heck I love each and every song on here!!  Changes sounds like something Ozzy would go on to do with his solo carreer.  <br />I don't understand the people who give the album bad reviews, personally I can't find anything wrong with this one, great introduction to the band if your new ot them.
B000059HCI|5.0|If you ever get into your skull that drugs will make the porblems in your life go away, go see this movie. It's like a train wreck-terrifying, disgusting and utterly spellbinding.<BR>Previous to this movie I had always had an aversion to drug flicks. You know what I mean,they're either preachy or flashy, filled with glamorous, talented people or crummy low-lifes. Then I heard about the movie when I saw the Oscars and a couple of months later the name was still stuck in my head. I hadn't heard too much about the plot except that it had to do with drugs and that it was good. Four stars from pretentious critics good. So I decided to check it out.<BR>The cover made it seem like arty, stream-of-conciousness garbage and I almost didn't rent it. Thank God I did. I have never considered taking drugs in my entire life, but if there was even the tiniest doubt that I might, this movie obliterated it. At first the interesting camera work caught me off-guard but slowly I started to get into it. As I did, (wonder of wonders!) I started to feel for the characters. They aren't crummy low-lifes. Jared and Jennifer's characters really do love each other, Marlon Wayans is a lost mama's boy, and Ellen Burstyn just wants her life to be like the &quot;as advertised on TV&quot; version. But slowly as addiction takes over, their lives collectively spin out of control.<BR>This movie is watchable for the last sequence alone (pathologically disturbing) and I highly encourage everyone to watch it. You won't regret it (except maybe for the second when Jared Leto is injecting himself in his gangrenous arm).
B00005A46T|5.0|...looks like Slipknot predicted what was most likely going to happen with this CD... Those of you who said that they don't like their new CD because they didn't do the rap-rock thing again or something else like that, go back inside and pop in a Backstreet Boys CD and have fun, I'll listen to Slipknot though, thanks.  In the Guitar World issue with Mick and Jim, they said that this new CD isn't for the fly-by-night fans and will certainly pick out the loyal ones.  Looks like that happened, everyone who wrote a bad review pretty much stated the same thing that was &quot;wrong&quot; with this CD.  I thing this CD is the best thing metal has going for it, it's definently a ray of light in a music scene full of fake mall-metal bands.  Every song is awesome, no need to go through one by one. Buy it!
0767903862|5.0|Nothing makes me want to travel more than a book by Bill Bryson.  His adventures in Australia make me want to see/find the unknown plants, to look for gold in the desert, to see the ancient microbiology of the west coast(of course, at all times keepng an eye out for deadly things that could kill me instantaneously).  Maybe I will hitch a ride to Australia and see the Great Barrier Reef(watching out for sharks the whole time of course)
6305499365|5.0|I have a theory about upward mobility as it exists in a corporate workplace (actually, I've been relaying this theory for so long that I no longer remember if it is my own, or if I've stolen it from someone smarter than I; If it's the latter, I apologize for my thievery).  If one is ambitious enough, and good enough at their job, they will get promoted.  If they are still ambitious, and good enough at this new job, they will get promoted again.  This process continues until said person reaches the limits of their abilities.  Then they are promoted one last time, into a job that they can't possibly handle.  This is where they stay for the rest of their working lives.  I've seen it happen time and time again at my place of work, and it's this kind of sophistic reasoning that gets spoofed so mercilessly -- and so perfectly -- in &quot;Office Space&quot;.<br />Writer/Director Mike Judge has crafted a spot on depiction of office life in the latter part of the twentieth century.  Technology has advanced to such a degree that those who fail to understand it are either relegated to being its slaves (a running joke here has a nefarious fax machine tormenting two programmers) or promoted to management.  Those in the latter category, made obsolete by technological advancements and having no real duties themselves, are relegated to becoming bothersome micromanagers, in the hopes that their stock rises a quarter of a point.  Everyone is worried about job security, and rightly so, for the average worker is about as interchangeable as the coffee machine, and respected less.  And anyone with any semblance of a soul is constantly involved in bemoaning the wastefulness of their lives.<br />Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingstone) is one such troubled soul.  He's involved in his company's Y2K readiness project (with the benefit of hindsight, the pointlessness of this task is made even more pointed).  But he despises his job.  Tormented by ennui but hampered by lethargy, he sees no way out.  Afateful visit to a career-counseling hypnotist frees him from his shackles, by allowing him to relax into his job.  His newfound candidness is, of course, rewarded with a promotion.  Livingstone imbues Peter with a bland everymaness that is at once appealing and relatable.  He is surrounded by a madcap menagerie of accurately depicted office drones.<br />David Herman (as the unfortunately named Michael Bolton) and Ajay Naidu play Peter's clueless programmer buddies, rebellious enough to constantly plot against the company, but too scared to do anything about it.  The three of them share my favourite scene in the movie, when the aforementioned fax machine is smuggled out of the office, and beaten mercilessly with a baseball bat.  Judge handles the scene like a hit in a mob movie, or a drive-by shooting, adding aggressive hip-hop music to the soundtrack, to play up the ridiculousness of the situation.  The scene is played as horrific, but turns out truly hilarious.  Other office citizens include John C. McGinley and Paul Willson, who play gleefully insipid consultants, brought in to give the company an excuse to downsize, and Richard Riehle as a paranoid lifer, whose job may or may not be redundant.<br />The biggest cheers in the cast go to Gary Cole and Stephen Root.  The former plays VP Bill Lumbergh.  He's every employee's worst nightmare: a lifeless, endlessly droning, boring, malicious, and unimaginative manager.   Brought to life through a costume that includes unfashionable glasses, shirts that match collar to cuffs, and an ever-present coffee mug, Lumbergh subtly terrorizes all who serve him with salutations that make him appear interested, but in fact amplifies the apathy he has for his employees.  Cole nails Lumbergh perfectly, allowing the man's slime to ooze from every pore.  Stephen Root, in the film's showiest role, plays Milton, a milquetoast, asocial, &quot;squirrelly looking guy&quot;.  Saddled with coke bottle thick glasses and an inflamed complexion, Milton is the ultimate social outcast.  Root gives Milton an under-his-breath lispy voice, easy to overlook.  So much so that his repeated threats to &quot;burn the building down&quot; if not granted any respect go unnoticed.  The passive aggressive cat and mouse game fought between Lumbergh and Milton over a stapler (!) provide for some of the film's best and most telling moments.<br />Jennifer Aniston, who plays Livingstone's love interest, does fine work with an underwritten role.  She brings a kind of quirky restlessness to Joanna the waitress (tormented by a witless boss of her own, played by Mike Judge himself), although her desperation shines through as well (otherwise, why would she torture herself working at a classless establishment as &quot;Chotchkie's&quot;?).<br />&quot;Office Space&quot; will touch a nerve with anyone whose ever worked in a large office.  In fact, if you've ever encountered schizophrenic traffic (the film's opening scene follows Peter on his morning commute; he's caught in a hilarious catch-22, as any lane he changes to slows to a stop, just as the lane he's just come from starts to move), been bothered by door-to-door magazine salesmen, gotten zinged by static electricity, or been maligned by any of a dozen other inconveniences of modern urban life, you'll find something here to relate to.  And, ultimately, laugh at.

B00005NI5Y|5.0|Love this recording. I saw Dylan many years ago in Lakeland and a few years ago in Tampa.....always changing. The last time, he had a swing band opening for him...this is the kind of sound you hear \\"Summer Days\\". And then there is \\"the rockin blues \\"Lonesome Day Blues\\" (Blonde on Blonde revisited:).Take a listen. Any Dylan fan will be pleased!
0684847817|5.0|I love this man's art. And the fact that his books aren't just galleries, but contain interesting and wonderful information makes it even better. All the images here contain their own special personalities, and it isn't hard to believe he has pixies sitting on his desk, and goblins hiding things in his kitchen.
B00005B36H|5.0|I've not been a TOOL fan for too terribly long.  Just since April.  My friend let me borrow Aenima.  I loved it.  So I bought Lateralus when it came out.  Let me tell any of you right now, that any of the people out there calling Keenan's lyrics &quot;neanderthalish&quot; obviously haven't listened to this album more than once or twice.  I think what threw a lot of long time fans is the lack of swear words on this album.  I've only been able to find one, in &quot;Ticks &amp; Leeches&quot;.  Instead, this the lyrics on this album explore relationships.  Grudges, communication, topics like that.  They are incredibly deep, and not nearly so angry as some of the tracks off of Aenima.  The flow between &quot;Parabol&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot; is seriously one of my favorite moments in any song I've ever heard.  This album shows Maynard James Keenan at his most poignant.  I'm not in any way dumping on his lyrics up until this point, but I'm saying that his songwriting on this album is better than any I've heard from him.  <br />This album also comes with a little makeover in the sound of the guitars.  I don't know how to explain it, only because I'm not a musician.  I can tell you I like the way it sounds a whole lot.<br />Do yourself a favor, and buy this album.
0399146253|3.0|Good plot but much to wordy and seems the author wishes to impress us with her knowledge which we certainly do acknowledge however just too much of a good thing!

B00005JKHP|4.0|When Academy Award winning director Robert Wise released the first Star Trek film back in 1979 he, like George Lucas, wasn't content with the final cut or special effects, which were imperfect mainly due to timing constraints. 22 years later and Wise has reworked the film in every respect. <br />There are a few versions of Star Trek the motion picture, but this isn't the culmination of all the footage available combined into one long version. In fact, in total it's only 5 minutes longer than the original theatrical version. The (5) scenes that are taken out / deleted from the original version are on the second disc thankfully plus 11 scenes missing from all previous versions. It's more replacement and enhancement. For example, Spock's ceremony on Vulcan, the visuals of the landscape are brand new (huge statues everywhere). New special effects from Foundation Imaging are also present, including a new computer generated Enterprise plus other sequences have been tweaked.<br />It's digitally remastered, the sound mix is new, there are new special effects, new scenes (and trimmed old scenes). In short, it's 70% of the original movie. <br />However, it's not perfect, it feels very different. Some of the re-editing has really helped it. There were 2 really dodgy scenes involving Ilya and Decker in the original where he sets a new course after the wormhole and she crassly responds with &quot;Science officer's computation's confirmed sir&quot; then they both smile at each other. While this line has been removed, the smile is inserted earlier in the film when the ship is leaving the solar system. A good decision. Secondly, Chekov's hand injury is nicely underscored with some music. I feel that too many of the scenes have been shortened or deleted. While Wise has corrected the pacing in the earlier part of the film, it seems like everything is resolved too quickly.<br />The sound also loses some atmosphere. The restoration team have obviously thought &quot;we can put a new sound effect in here, here and here&quot; - it's really over the top especially when you hear computer noises from the Enterprise-D (Next Generation) in there. While the sound mix of music and effects are impressive the vocals are as muffled and quiet as they always were. As for the picture quality, it's not been cleaned up at all.<br />Special Visual effects are neatly inserted, a couple of shots of the Enterprise here and there but nowhere near as many as I was expecting. The new scene with V'Ger launching orbiting devices looks excellent.<br />As for the film itself, it's not the best Star Trek film if you compare to the Wrath of Khan or First Contact but it's huge in scope; although slow and cerebral it's still a feast for the senses after all these years. The only problem is that this isn't the &quot;right&quot; director's cut. It's half the way there, better pacing, better editing but there's too much missing. You can't help wondering that the scenes that were removed could have been inserted in a clever way with new effects to improve the movie further.
B000002J09|5.0|This is one great ablum!  It has some of the greatest Zeppelin songs ever writen.  From Black Dog to Stairway to Heaven this album is awsome!  The song quility is so clear compared to the record it is amazing!  This is the best Lep album that they made!
B00005NOZ6|5.0|If anyone still had any doubts that Dream Theater is the greatest live band in the world, then this new live album has surely erased them. This huge, sprawling, monumental 3-disc, 3+ hours performance captured here for our enjoyment is quite simply progressive rock music at its best. Dream Theater is a technically adept band, and they play their songs onstage with skill and precision, but they also manage to avoid the shortcoming that a lot of bands don't, which is to say that they do not sound cold and sterile, overly technical, as they constantly jam and improvise on their songs, and include bits from other artists songs as they go along. This makes for a very lively performance. This album is simply a must for the DT fan. It includes all three of their extended suites: their last album, the magnum opus Scenes From A Memory, amazingly much improved (not to mention Metropolis Part I), A Change of Seasons (which incorporates The Simpsons Theme, among others), and the three-part &quot;A Mind Beside Itself&quot; from Awake. There is more than a handful of other material as well. All of it is immaculately performed, and inherently listenable. This is an excellent way for the band to close out this portion of their career, as the millennium has ended, and they have delivered their masterpiece (Scenes From A Memory), and this serves as a sort of capstone, a copendium of all that they have accomplished up to this point. It contains most of their best songs, and shows their strengths as a live band. It also shows that they are a band who cares about their fans, as it includes three full discs of music at the price of a normal double-disc set. This is not to be missed.

B00005A46T|1.0|You call THIS music?! Pul-eeze. All it is is some band of punk guys banging on some drums or strumming on a guitar and screaming at the top of their lungs - screaming angry lyrics like they are always mad at the world or something. Slipknot is just plain weird. I can't believe you call hard metal real music over pop. That just isn't so. I think I'll go listen to my sweet pop albums over these angst hard metal ones. Most hard metal .... The only hard metal rock bands I can stand are Metellica and Limp Bizkit Otherwise, hard metal isn't for me. I just don't see how people can actually call this real music. I like the classic rock, alternative, and regular rock, but I don't like this. Listening to hard metal rock gives me headaches. So what if they write their own music and play their own instruments? So does some pop artists and bands. This is not what I call artistry or original. And if you think pop is a trend, well so is hard metal. Hard metal is also manufactured and featured on TRL. This is the truth. As much as hardcore hard metal fans hate to admit it, it's all true. I'd listen to 'N Sync over Slipknot (the worst pop band ever). So feel free to write all kinds of negative and hate comments to me about how pop ... and hard metal rules. But this is how I feel about hard metal. Instead of this junk, go buy some real music by groups like Backstreet Boys and Dream Street. I know you think I'm crazy for saying that, but really - listen to them. Just keep away from this ...!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie is one of the most intriguing stories that have been told on film, mysterious but clear if you stick with it. The DVD is a pretty nice package-you'll like the fact that you can see the scenes in chronological order and the tattoo gallery is pretty cool. To tell the truth I can't say anything bad about \\"Memento\\" because I just love this movie!The acting is marvelous and the way the story is told is captivating. Check out Guy Pearce of L.A. Confidential-this guy can act!! Don't know why Hollywood is ignoring him. He held this story together perfectly and allowed us to get into the mind of this poor man who's on a mission that at most times is so hard for him to stay focused on because of his \\"condition\\" so he delevops ways to remind himself of important details about his quest for revenge that are quite amazing-like tattoos and Polaroid snapshots of people and cars, etc. I liked Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Anne Moss too. Christopher Nolan's screenwriting is wonderful. This should get plenty of Oscar nods but sadly, the Academy, like most people who look for entertainment has a short attention span and impatience with quality film making that makes you think. Too bad.
0553274503|5.0|This is a truly touching, yet often overlooked novel. It follows the progress of a mentally retarded man who is given an operation to increase his IQ. The entire book is written through Charlie's progress reports, written by Charlie himself, as a sort of diary. As Charlie's IQ increases, his spelling improves, he starts to become aware of people's attitude towards him, and he begins to learn how to love. Soon, Charlie's IQ skyrockets. He learns several languages in a matter of days. He composes sonatas, without ever having a music lesson. He understands human emotion more than any other average person. Yet, tragically, the effects of his operation start to wear off. The reader sees Charlie's grammar slowly start to decline. Soon, Charlie is right back where he was when he started, but the reader is certainly not. The first-person writing in this novel truly connects the characters to the reader. I would definitely put this amazing novel on any bookworm's top 10 list. It's on mine!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I just bought and listened to this new Dylan CD today. I was listening to the second song on the CD called &quot;Mississippi&quot; and I thought I had heard the song before. Then it struck me, it was the same song from Sheryl Crow's last album &quot;The Globe Sessions&quot; that came out a few years ago.<br />I thought, why is Bob Dylan doing a Sheryl Crow song? He really hasn't done anything like this since &quot;Self Portrait&quot; came out over 30 years ago.<br />I ran back home, got out my Sheryl Crow album and much to my amazement found out that Dylan had written the song in the first place several years ago. Interesting deal on this; did he write the song for Sheryl Crow as a kind of gift? Sheryl Crow is such a fine songwriter she really doesn't need anybody's help. Does anybody know the whole story behind this?<br />I listened to Sheryl's version (which has an upbeat, pop feel to it) and compared it to Dylan's version. No contest; Dylan's version is better because this is a song of regret that is better sung by somebody who has a world weariness about them. <br />In Sheryl's version, it sounds like she spend a week in Mississippi and left because she was wasting her time. In Dylan's version, it seems like he'd spent twenty years in Mississippi and had wasted most of his life. Big difference.<br />Perhaps over time, Sheryl Crow will have lived long enough to sing this song again and have it really mean something. As it stands, her current version as stacked up to Dylan's falls apart into a heap of dust, and sounds like the whining of a twenty year old spoiled girl.
B00003CXX8|1.0|Gosh, this movie was so lame and so ridiculous. There was no suspense, no thrill at all, and not for one second was I hooked to this movie. The whole premise of the movie is screwed up. The kids' parent's die, and the guardians they're forced to live with are only after their money (not to mention psycho), so they're basically killed. What was the point of this all?
B00003CXZ1|5.0|This movie is for harcore fans of the Tomb Raider series only. I think that the reason everyone hated this movie so much is because they had no appreciation for the game. Or maybe they did, and the fact that the movie just plain wasn't that good made them not like it. Did that make sense? The lowdown: I only gave this movie 5 stars because I love Angelina Jolie and I love the tomb raider franchise as a whole. I love everything about it. So if you aren't a hardcore fan of the series or you have taste in movies, don't get this one.
0201508036|2.0|The book contains so much math formulas in the beginning that you probably think that you have to go back to your math books. If you have to get this book for your class then basically you are in trouble like me unless you are an expert. The book is not also very interesting in reading. Authors do have technical knowledge but have no clue how to hold the readers. Unless you are wasting your life for Image Processing only then I recommend getting this book otherwise \\"Big No-No\\" for everyone else.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|As a frequent cinema go-er and a media studies student I am rarely dazzled by a film, but this one left me speechless and desperate to see it again. Still transfixed by the fantastic music, energetic and original dances and touching storyline i rushed out to by the soundtrack so that i could keep a piece of the movie with me until i can buy it on video. If your dubious of the film because of mixed reviews there really is nothing to lose. Go and see it just to feel the excitement and energy that has been put into this film but dont forget to take your tissues!!
0440180295|5.0|I first picked up this book in a [retail store] as a freshman in high school. This book was on my AP English class, and I had a good friend who was a sophomore who read and recommended it to me.<BR>So one day a month or so after bying this book I pick it up and start reading it. <BR>Vonnegut has a style that reminds me of a seven year old who has been eating sugar cubes, which is a good thing, because it keeps you from being bored.<BR>Along with this impressive writing style, Vonnegut adds a thought provoking plot.<BR>Well worth the money.
0553106635|5.0|...that i almost broke down into tears when i heard how long id have to wait to get the next book.<BR> <BR>this entire series is absolutely amazing! it is definitely not for those who are easily offended, because there is a lot of material some may find tasteless, but personally, i feel that all that material just adds more power.<br />i love how there is no one archetypal hero. u have to find your own hero(es). anything can happen in this world. no one is invincible, with supernatural powers that aid him/her (but dont get me wrong, i like supernatural powers too). to expand on the powers part, i love how Martin keeps the magic &quot;quiet&quot;, like Tolkien. its there, but its something strange to you because you dont know how it works.<br />all together, this is a great series, and it just gets better and better w/ each installment. i mean it. this is a MUST for fantasy fans.
B00003CXAA|5.0|It's the film that started the whole mafia craze, appeals to all type of movie goers, it has a beautiful plot, action, violence, intriguing and interesting characters, and a mastermind director Coppolla, and talented writer Mario Puzo that brings all these elements together for a good family fun movie. It also has good dvd extras for the techies and nerds out there
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men captures a part of American History, though not long in our past, still mostly forgotten.  The Depression forced millions of people to loose their jobs, their homes, and in many instances their identities.  The Dust Bowl, which spurred this Great Depression, also forced many people to emmigrate to other parts of the country, and search for employment.<br />For our main character, George and Lenny, they too have been deeply affected by the dust bowl, and along with countless others, are searching for employment, as well as the right piece of land where they might finally settle and live.  The only problem is, that they can never stay in one place long enough to find that piece of land.  Lenny, who is mentally retarded, keeps getting into trouble, and George always has to bail him out; the result of which leads them both to make a run for it until they come upon a new place of employment.<br />Their final destination, and the most promising for George and Lenny turns out to be their worst.  Up until they enter upon this ranch, Lenny has had a fixation and obsession with stroking &quot;pretty&quot; animals, many of which have been mice.  Inadvertantly he has killed them all; breaking their necks as they struggled to free themselves from Lenny's grip.  Lenny's innocence does not allow him to understand why the animals have tried to flee.  In his anger and confussion he squeezes them harder so they cannot escape.<br />Killing animals is one thing.  But when Lenny inadvertantly kills Curly's wife, George finally realizes that Lenny cannot be controlled.  Knowing what Curly and the other men will do to Lenny, George resolves to beat them to it, in a more humane manner.  <br />&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is more than just a story of friendship.  It is a psychological drama which plays out in our minds as we read deeper into the story.  And to see it played out, I recommend the early movie version with Burgess Merideth as George, and Lon Chaney Jr. as Lenny.
B00005JIZA|5.0|Every song on here is great.  I am going to see him on Saturday in Boston and can't wait.  This album is great &quot;Background music for life.&quot;  Nothing better came out this year.  (Although the PushStars &quot;Opening Time&quot; is a close second).  Buy this one and you won't be able to stop playing it.
B000002I6V|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time. I never would have made it out of my teen years if it weren't for this record. I still find it incredibly beautiful, moving and inspiring.
0345442989|5.0|...if you're a Sith lord, that is.<br />Ahh, Palpatine, it's always a treat to see him in action, and Luceno has the great one's character dead-on. Make no mistake, this is a Palpatine book, for even when the unassuming Senator from Naboo isn't in the spotlight his presence is felt as he lurks in the shadows, pulling the strings that bring about the rise and fall of many principle characters.<br />Whether acting the part of kindly old friend and confidant or displaying his might in his Sith lord incarnation, Palpatine proves himself deserving of the status of ultimate SW villian.<br />Often imitated (how many bad guys in sci-fi and fantasy fiction since ROTJ have just been Palpy knock-offs?) poorly duplicated (Dark Empire...shudder) but never surpassed (sure, some great baddies have appeared in the EU: Thrawn and Tierce in the Zahn books, Dzem in Planet of Twilight, and most recently Lord Shimrra in the NJO, but none of them can match the Emperor), Palpatine weaves a web so tangled it's all but impossible for even the closest reader to divine what his real goal is.<br />Of course, you can't build an entire book around the villian: Luceno's novel tells an action-packed story, features some great cameos, gives a lot of useful background info (if only this had been published before Phantom Menace, a lot of fans would have enjoyed the movie more, or at least been able to understand it!), and gives readers an inside look at the Jedi council and philosophy, but we all know who the main man is, even if the other characters don't. Tell me you don't feel chill whenever Palpatine interacts with someone and ends up maneuvering the dupe to do his bidding without the poor soul even realising it!<BR>After reading this, I can hardly wait to see the great one on-screen again in Episode II!<br />May the Force be with the SW universe (they'll need it with Palps to contend with).
B00005NZBN|3.0|I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.  This album is good, but it's a far cry from a masterpiece.  Perhaps most people are just happy to hear him still singing solid music.  But theres nothing new or innovative going on in the melodies, nothing major to be worked out in the lyrics...<br />What we do have are enjoyable lyrics, tight musicianship and some fine songs - most notably &quot;Mississippi&quot;, &quot;Floater&quot; &amp; &quot;Po' Boy&quot;.  Not a masterpiece, but a nice piece of work from the mature Dylan.
0140284087|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  It's very funny and entertaining!<BR>I'd give it more stars if I could.
B000021XS0|5.0|There is no word that will ever be able to describe this album!  &quot;Great&quot; is not good enough!  &quot;Masterpiece&quot; isn't either.  I never knew that music like this could EVER exist!  This was the second Dream Theater album I heard (the first being 1992's Images and Words, which dissapointed me at first), and it literally has changed my taste in music, for the better, it seems.  After my dissapointment of Images and Words, I wasn't expecting much.  I was, basically, a metal head, looking for as much E5 chords as you could fit into a song.  I heard the first track, and thought &quot;This album is inspired by LSD&quot;.  As I listened for the first time, I was surfing through ye olde internet, and I didn't appreciate the album, until the very last song.  I was amazed, just by the very last riff!!!  I then went to my room, and listened to it again, and, since that day, I have been a Dream Theater fan!!!  The aforementioned first track, Regression, is a very simple song, but is actually quite likable.  Then, it goes into &quot;Overture&quot;.  After this song is finished with you, you can't help but focus your attention to the sounds completely!!!  There is not one song on this album that does not sound like it shouldn't be there!  Everything is perfectly placed.  Unless you have the CD with you, it's sometimes impossible to tell where one song ends and another begins.  Everything blends so well.<br />Unfortunatly, amongst &quot;the majority&quot;, this album is greatly unappreciated!  This is not a pop-friendly album.  What it is, though, is an almost perfect blend of instruments and vocals, lyrics so complex yet meaningful that only geniuses like Mike Portnoy and John Pettrucci can come up with, and, in my groovy opinion, one of the best albums of all time, and it is very likely to remain this way.<br /><BR>Of all the songs, my personal favourites are 'Fatal Tragedy', 'Beyond This Life', 'Home', 'The Dance of Eternity' and the very haunting, and emotional,'Finally Free', without which, I don't think I could have appreciated this album to the fullest.
B00003CX5P|3.0|This edition, that is recently coming to DVD, appears to have all the bells and whistles that is humanly possible. This is fantastic to see, since my all-time favorite movie is Star Wars: A New Hope. The reason I give Episode 1 three stars, is because it appears Lucas was trying to capture family audiences with special effects and goofy characters, instead of just telling the story. Still though, I did see the movie twice in the theaters. Why? #1, just because it's part of the Star Wars saga, and #2, because the Jedi action scenes turned out even better than I could've imagined. Scenes like Quang Gon Jin burning through the blast door with his light saber and Darth Maul staring at Obi Wan between the laser divider, during that unbelievable fight scene. These Jedi fight scenes, I believe, surpass the original. Other than that, the movie was entertaining, with an excellent cast. In the upcoming Episode 2, I don't really know what to expect. If Lucas was satisfied with &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, but not happy with, &quot;A New Hope&quot;, what are we about to expect? Critics gave The Phantome Menace 2 1/2 stars and A New Hope 4 stars. Will we see another 2 1/2 star action movie, or a 4 star brilliant work of art? Let's hope he learns from his mistakes, because by the time this trilogy is finished, I may be over the hill. :-)
B00004W510|5.0|Greil Marcus of Rolling Stone Magazine called this &quot;a 12-sided jewel&quot; in 1969.  Not to disrespect Mr. Marcus, but that is a complete understatement.  While I am partial to Music From Big Pink, this is quite possibly the greatest music of any genre ever produced.  Listen to Garth Hudson's sheer brilliance on &quot;Up On Cripple Creek&quot; or Robbie Robertson's guitar solo at the end of &quot;King Harvest&quot;, or Rick Danko's (R.I.P.) crisp, tenor voice on &quot;Unfaithful Servant&quot;.  Richard Manuel (R.I.P.) and Levon Helm bring tears to one's eyes in their duet on &quot;Whispering Pines&quot;.  Anyone who has not heard this album and calls himself/herself a music fan, must purchase this album soon to retain that claim.  The Band was by far the most innovative and talented rock group in history and for anyone to have not heard their second album will not have a large gap in their musical experience.  There has not been and will never be another group like them, so this is a can't miss, timeless album.  Rick and Richard, we sorely miss you guys and will keep you in our hearts and minds forever.
B00000DCHD|5.0|Billy Joel won Grammys for this and I think rightfully so.  This is a great album, a sidestep from &quot;The Stranger,&quot; jazzier and lighter.<br />I really like every song on this album.  Each one has their own &quot;artistic merit&quot; and before I knew that Joel had won awards for this, I would glance at the CD cover, run through all the tracks in my head and think, &quot;This is a phenomenal group of songs.&quot;<br />&quot;Big Shot&quot; is the rock number and a nice opener (Word on the street is that it was written after a really bad date with Bianca Jagger).  &quot;Honesty&quot; is a poignant piece with thought-provoking lyrics.  I particularly like the way Billy segueways from the line &quot;'Cause you're the one that I depend upon...&quot; into the chorus, &quot;Honesty is such a lonely word,&quot; without taking a breath.  There's another &quot;word-on-the-street&quot; story behind this song regarding Liberty Devitto, Billy Joel's drummer but I'd rather not mention it here.  :)  If you want to know, email me.<br />&quot;My Life,&quot; the theme from &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; (that sitcom where Tom Hanks-- yes, *that* Tom Hanks-- dressed like a woman) is catchy and fun and has fabulous &quot;Screw you&quot; lyrics.  &quot;Zanzibar&quot; is probably the jazziest of all number and is my least favorite, not because I don't like jazz but because the lyrics are basically about a sports bar and therefore not nearly as &quot;touching&quot; as the ones in &quot;Honesty.&quot;  :)<br />&quot;Stiletto&quot; is this dark number that always makes me think of alleys behind bars and the creepy people lurking in them (although that's not what it's about).  Very, very good metaphor here (I sound like the English major that I am) and very, very effective.  &quot;Rosalinda's Eyes&quot; was written sort of about Billy's mother.  It's calypso-ish and has a bit of a Latin groove to it. &quot;Half a Mile Away&quot; is probably my favorite piece on here just because I like the uptempo beat and the musical phrasing.  &quot;Until the Night&quot; is the &quot;show-stopping&quot; ballad and reminds me a lot of &quot;This Night&quot; from the &quot;Innocent Man&quot; album.<br />&quot;52nd Street&quot; the title track is the shortest one but is a lot of fun and a nice ending.  Billy deserved the awards that he won for this album.  Don't be surprised to hear things here that you don't hear on &quot;Storm Front,&quot; &quot;The Stranger,&quot; or &quot;River of Dreams&quot; though.  He took some chances and I think you'll agree that they paid off.
B00004W50T|5.0|Back in 1968, five young men created an album in the basement of a small house in Woodstock, NY.  That album is called Music From Big Pink, named affectionately after it's origin.  Eric Clapton has claimed that the album has changed his life and the direction music was headed during the psychadelic era that was the late '60's.  Listen to the three lead singers belt out &quot;We Can Talk&quot;, one of the group's most underappreciated songs, Richard Manuel's emotional voice on &quot;Tears of Rage&quot;, Rick Danko's belting out of the verses to &quot;Wheel's on Fire&quot;, the masterpiece he created with Bob Dylan, Levon Helm's soulful rendition of &quot;The Weight&quot;, Garth Hudson's intro to &quot;Chest Fever&quot;, and Robbie Robertson's guitar during &quot;Caledonia Mission&quot;.  These are five men whose combined talents added up to more of the sum of their parts, a rarity for a music group.  A truly special album, with a distinct sound.  Rick and Richard, we haven't forgotten you.

There's another &quot;word-on-the-street&quot; story behind this song regarding Liberty Devitto, Billy Joel's drummer but I'd rather not mention it here. :) If you want to know, email me.<br />&quot;My Life,&quot; the theme from &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; (that sitcom where Tom Hanks-- yes, *that* Tom Hanks-- dressed like a woman) is catchy and fun and has fabulous &quot;Screw you&quot; lyrics. &quot;Zanzibar&quot; is probably the jazziest of all the numbers and is my least favorite, not because I don't like jazz but because the lyrics are basically about a sports bar and therefore not nearly as &quot;touching&quot; as the ones in &quot;Honesty.&quot; :)<br />&quot;Stiletto&quot; is this dark number that always makes me think of alleys behind bars and the creepy people lurking in them (although that's not what it's about). Very, very good metaphor in the song (I sound like the English major that I am) and very, very effective. &quot;Rosalinda's Eyes&quot; was written sort of about Billy's mother. It's calypso-ish and has a bit of a Latin groove to it. &quot;Half a Mile Away&quot; is probably my favorite piece on here just because I like the uptempo beat and the musical phrasing. &quot;Until the Night&quot; is the &quot;show-stopping&quot; ballad and reminds me a lot of &quot;This Night&quot; from the &quot;Innocent Man&quot; album.<br />&quot;52nd Street&quot; the title track is the shortest one but is a lot of fun and a nice ending. As I said earlier, Billy really deserved the awards that he won for this album. Don't be surprised to hear things here that you don't hear on &quot;Storm Front,&quot; &quot;The Stranger,&quot; or &quot;River of Dreams&quot; though. He took some chances and I think you'll agree that they paid off.
B000002KIC|4.0|Before you read further, I would like to make a bold statement many would agree with. Robbie Robertson undermined the philosophy that The Band had established with his entire attitude towards this concert. These were five men who each considered themselves equals amongst eachother and Robertson decided he would simply end the group's sixteen years with a film none of the others were interested in pursuing. Not only that, Robbie had Martin Scorcese film him almost exclusively, both on stage and during interviews. Notice how rare the shots are of Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel, two pieces of The Band just as important as the guitarist. This is all without considering the studio overdubs present on the album. With the exception of Levon Helm, each musician's performance was enhanced during the production of both the film and the album. The special moments are present however: arguably the finest live version of \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\", Muddy Waters' \\"Mannish Boy\\", Van Morrison's \\"Caravan\\", and The Staples joining in for \\"The Weight\\" (studio). What makes this 4-stars however, is what is missing: a spectacular version of \\"Wheel's On Fire\\", a stunning cover of \\"Acadian Driftwood\\" (a difficult song to perform live), Muddy Waters' \\"Caledonia\\", and most glaringly, \\"Don't Do It\\", the group's final live song with the original five members. Each of these can be heard on \\"The Complete Last Waltz\\", a historically valuable (if not in sound quality) bootleg that was released about five years ago. I hope that I have enlightened some of you as to the content and history of this concert. Rick and Richard, your music will live forever in our ears. Rest in peace.
B000002NAK|5.0|Middle-class girl, can act a bit, moves to the big city, climbs up the ladder and over a few men, sets her sights on nothing less than worldwide fame, does anything and everything to make that happen, and makes sure everyone in her life works toward the same goal. EVITA is, of course, the autobiography of Madonna. Or, at the very least, the story of Argentina's controversial populist hero Eva Peron is the role of Madonna's life. Say what you want about how well she acts it, but this lush pop-rock soundtrack is hard digital proof that she was born to sing it. Completely giving herself over to the role--the one thing her critics doubted she could everdo--Madonna turns in a vocal performance that may well surpass that on any of her own records.<br />Madonna also, not surprisingly, dominates this soundtrack. She sings some parts, including the sad ballad &quot;Another Suitcase In Another Hall,&quot; that weren't written for the role of Eva Peron; and Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, who won a slew of Tony Awards for the 1979 Broadway version of &quot;Evita,&quot; have given her a new ballad, &quot;You Must Love Me,&quot; that works equally well as an anthem for either Madonna or Peron. Actor Antonio Banderas, following up his small singing role in the movie &quot;Desperado,&quot; proves a more-than-capable Che Guevara.
B00005NZBN|5.0|While none of the songs (except the magnificent &quot;Mississipi&quot; which has some of his best vocals in a long time) can hold a candle to &quot;Not Dark Yet&quot; from &quot;Time out of Mind&quot;, each and every track has something special to it, which the 1997 Grammy winner can't, making it a better overall album.  The songs &quot;Po' Boy&quot; and &quot;Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum&quot; are also instant Dylan classics.  Last, but not least, the alternate version of &quot;Times the are a Changin'&quot; is an added bonus to a wonderful album, and possibly his last (God forbid).  A treat for any birthday or someone who has shown interest in Dylan.  Bobby, to put it in your priceless words, &quot;You ain't goin' nowhere&quot;.
B00005K3OT|5.0|The recent atrocity by spineless cowards in NY found me in dire need of a comedy. I've always been a movie freak, and knew that \\"Chocolat\\" was up for Oscars...yet, reviews kept me from seeing it or renting it (I'm so ahshamed to admit it!) Well, the reviews were wrong.\\"Traffic\\" was moving & profound, and OH! so heavy. \\"Gladiator\\" was very good, but over-rated...my favorite of the Best Picture nominees this year was \\"Erin Brockovich\\" because it had humor as well as a riveting performance by Julia about an important issue. The luminescent Juliette Binoche has never given a bad performance (absolutely deserved her Oscar for \\"English Patient\\"). \\"Chocolat\\" is timely, now more than ever.Like a faiy tale, it's a tale about good & \\"evil\\", but only certain people's idea of evil. Fundamentalist behavior? So appropriate. Johnny Depp is always great, and Dame Dench & Lena Olin and Alfred Molina were so in touch.This is not a trivial film, as some Academy critics have said. I enjoyed it immensely and recommend this to people who love to laugh at intolerance. This is not a film about decadent indulgence (well, not entirely). It's a thoughtful display of a fairy tale world where good triumphs over evil. RENT or BUY THIS FILM!
B00003CXP1|1.0|This movie is a post-modernist deconstructed pipebomb that highlights flawed belief systems by gutting the viewer with images of obscene and horrific nihilism. And, it is really not that innovative. A self-conscious Grand Guignol from a sophmoric film student with a poor first showing in the boring and borish Pi.<br />Clever misanthropes like Miller, Celine and Kerouac always have discovered something of the sadness that sleeps next to beauty-and often overwhelms it. This is a useless book translated into a propoganda real for the Director's MTV editing chops and ill-formed moral intelligence.<br />It reflects bile as if reflecting bile is a grand intellectual experiment. It praises decandant sickness and then comdemns it in the same scene. Slickness unto death. The logical extension of the Western commerical art that rapes its subject while pretending to do so analytically.<br />I pity the world that allows this filth and its creator to peddle these perverse and nihilistic wares.<br />However, if you like that sort of thing, this movie is for you.<br />...
B00000IMCU|5.0|In this sequel to the classic Night of the Living Dead, director George A. Romero has seemed to discover that zombies aren't all that scary. &quot;Here comes a zombie! Ahhh!!!! Wait...I can step right around it, that was easy enough.&quot; With this new vision of the walking dead, he gives us the definitive zombie movie entitled Dawn of the Dead. This is the perfect film for a guy's night out. The gore is plentiful, the normal satirical black-comedy Romero uses so masterfully is there, and there's a gang of Mexican motorcyclists! What more could you ask for? Really?<br />How about character development that most Hollywood dramas can't touch? How about scathing commentary on America's racism problem? How about the ability to make the viewer actually sympathize with the ZOMBIES? This isn't your average drive-in, splatter flick. This is an entertaining and thought-provoking film that will go down in history as one of the best examples of horror that could be popped into the VCR. So gather the kiddies (heh heh) and enjoy Dawn of the Dead...you may want to skip eating the pop corn, though.
B000001C6M|5.0|This album, along with Venom's debut \\"Welcome To Hell\\" , is what I like to think of as the birth place of all that is wrong with musik, I really hate this band and their style of music.  Its just fast boring noise with filthy, hateful lyrics!!  Listen to Korn, Linkin Park, Kid Rock and Staind to here good music.  Also, support the Cincinnati bengals, the best football team in history!!  I'm out....
6300183211|5.0|Set in the sun-washed shores of Miami SCARFACE tells the tale of Antonio Montana,a smalltime cuban refugee hoodlum who makes his way to miami during Castro's jail evacuation in the spring of 1980.The film shows the rise Tony makes to the top of the Miami drug underworld and his subsequent fall because of bad decision making on his part due to his drug addiction. AL pacino delivers one of his greatest performances in this 1983 classic. The score for this film (done by Giorgio Moroder) is one of the greatest film scores I have ever heard.In the film Giorgio assigns music to each of the main characters(Tony,Gina,Elvira,and Alahandro Sosa)and playsit during critical moments in the film having to do with the character.This and other aspects of the film make it definately one of directer Brian DePalma's greatest masterpieces.
B000056JYC|5.0|There is little doubt that this is one of the essential arena rock albums ever! On Frampton Comes Alive Peter Frampton packs a huge punch where he is most comfortable; in front of thousands of screaming fans. (A situation most of us would hate to be a part of) His best songs are here, played better than ever. However there is more to this album than just Baby I Love Your Way. (However great that track may be.)<BR>This is a very consistent album with high kicking, energizing run throughs of Do You Feel Like We Do, Something's Happening, Show Me The Way, and Shine On. However some of the most listenable music is when Frampton's goes accoustic and solo for peaceuful renditions of Wind of Change, Just the Time of Year, Penny For Your Thoughts, and All I Want to Be (Is By Your Side). (In fact half of the first disc sounds like an MTV Unplugged concert)<BR>To put it simple there is not one bad song on this double album. Frampton Comes Alive is one of the best live albums ever, and is pop rock at its best. This 25th anniversary album is the best version as it contains some unreleased hard hitting versions of White Sugar and Nowhere's Too Far For My Baby, and also includes a great studio bonus track. (Day's Dawning). Don't delay. Get it NOW!

B00000253N|5.0|You could debate for hours on the topic of what is the greatest Dylan album. Is it Highway 61? Is it Blonde on Blonde? Is it Bringing it All Back Home?<BR>Though they are all brilliant albums the best of Dylan's 30 plus studio albums would have to be Blood on the Tracks. This is Dylan's most personal albums. For his first three classics he explored the problems of the world. He explores the difficulties of his own life. He explores love being won and love being lost. He sings of being &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot;, looking out for a &quot;Simple Twist of Fate&quot;, and of a woman giving him &quot;Shelter From the Storm.&quot; He sings of kindness and generosity. All is done with his brilliant accoustic guitar and a fine backing group.<BR>In conclusion Blood on the Tracks is Dylan's most listenable and appealing album. It is a folk rock classic. Dylan's Greatest Achievement. No fan of real music should be without it! GET IT NOW!
B00005LB50|4.0|The Springfield's 3 albums comprise one of the shortest and most valuable releases from any US rock band. Box Set shines for the most part but there are a few curious omissions. As mentioned before by others disc 4 is a bit repetitive. It probably should have been arranged a bit differently for the fans. The first three albums should have have appeared on the first three discs (with demos and outtakes including the much missed 9 minute version of Bluebird) with the fourth comprising demos that never made it to the finish line.<br />The packaging and research are just so-so. Rhino has done a splendid job on a number of other reissues so it's a bit surprising how weak this set is. The booklet is full of interesting pictures and clippings but I would have preferred to have the band's story told a bit more extensively with observations about each track/album. Instead we get a short history of the band and appreciation that is heartfelt but lacking in any real value.<br />The graphics are interesting but make the booklet hell to read. I really didn't need a where-are-they-now section. Instead, let's see an analysis of of the music and their times with a bit more depth than the superficial piece included. I've come to hate the large boxes for these sets as well. They are awkward. Why not do something similar to the Xtc BBC box set (with a more detailed book)?<br />Hopefully when Young gets around to reissuing his stuff on CD (I have to completely disagree with Young's assessment of CDs. While they have many limitations when mastered correctly and using the right format -i.e., 24 bit mastering, etc--they can sound terrific)he'll reintroduce a box set that's a little more comprehensive than this set. While it's nice that the Springfield finally got the recognition that they deserved (unlike say, Poco, 10cc, Loggins &amp; Messina and a number of other talented performers)and a box set, I just wish it could have been put together better.
B00005K3O4|5.0|I know name sounds stupied but it is actally better than you might think.the movie is about thes alines that look like clowns{duh!}come to earth and trap people in cotton candy concons and then drink thier blood.and these four teens and a cop try to stop them.i have the new dvd verison and it has a lot of speical features like five making-of featurettes, audio commentary with the chiodo brothers,2 drleted scenes whit directors commentary,some bloopers, storybord and photo gallery,and of coruse a theateical trailer.and also the film qulity is good.and despite waht some of the reviews say it is in widescreen.if you are a big fan of this movie buy the speical editon dvd.
B00004Z511|4.0|Finally, the wait is over! After three dark years away a new Radiohead album hits our shelves. We all knew we were going to get something different, after all, it is Radiohead that we're talking about, but did we think it was going to be this different? The fact that this wasn't anything that we were expecting could of been the albums downfall... BUT it's still a fantastic piece of music. I have an opinion of releif that this isn't just &quot;OK Computer, Part 2&quot; for this album shows that Radiohead are an extremely talented band who are open to new ideas. Take into account when &quot;OK Computer&quot; was released and the world was full of dissapiontment that they hadn't made &quot;The Bends#2&quot; and now that record is a landmark in music. I only gave this 4 rather than 5 stars coz I am a sucker for lyrics, especially those of Thom Yorke, and this album does have one too many instrumentals including the almost pointless title track. Though this is the case, the songs with lyrics are great. &quot;Optimistic&quot; would fit in on &quot;The Bends&quot; or &quot;OK Computer&quot; with it's heavy guitar riffs and catchy chorus, and &quot;How To Dissapear Completly&quot; a close relation of &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; and &quot;Exit Music&quot; showing off Thom Yorkes amazing voice and the albums only appearance of an acoustic guitar. In my opinion (and Thom Yorkes for that matter) the best song is &quot;Idioteque&quot; A rare look into Radioheads dance roots with it's thumping bass drum and a new found obsession with electronica. All in all I'd say when you buy this don't give up on it if you don't like it, it is worth the wait, just don't compare it to the other stuff or you might be put off. The only thing missing is a couple more tracks and the impressive solos of Jonny Greenwood on the guitar. But as I said, a fantastic piece of music, and should be added to the collection.

0446605409|5.0|Nelson Demille is awesome!  This is the first DeMille book I have read, and I couldn't put it down.  As soon as I finished it I started The Lion's Game.  I am an avid Clancy reader, but I wanted something that wasn't so technical.  I picked up this book and was not disappointed.  I fact I may have even liked it more than Clancy.  I have never read another author with DeMille's ability to make the words seem to jump off the page.  It was like watching a movie in my mind.  The plot was awesome and plausible, the characters were very realistic, and the dialogue was the best I have ever read.  I seamed as if I was there.  Great story.  Highly recommended.  If it is the first DeMille book you read, I can bet it won't be your last.
B0000524CY|5.0|I have seen this movie and all its sequel and none of them are as frightning are as good as this.The exorcist is about a little girl who gets possessed by a demon and as the movie goes on the mother contacts a exorcist that tries to get rid of the demon inside her.The movie is known as the scarest movie of all time for sure and the new 11 minutes are great and a very intense scene with regan walking down the stairs backwards.The picture is clear and the sound is excellent but the special freatures are slim with only 2 trailers, 4 T.V. previews and a director commentary but I found the main menu had errie music.All in all the movies great but the special features are slim.
B000000WA4|5.0|. . .just listen to this CD. This is one of the best CDs in my massive collection. There isn't a bad song on it, some just take more listenings than others to enjoy. Billy Corgan is an amazing songwriter putting such feeling into his lyrics and music. Some people may complain about his voice, but no matter what, you can truly hear the emotion in his voice, which I think is the most important aspect of a singer.<BR>This is the perfect CD to just lay back and listen to the whole way through. Some of my favorite songs (Zero, Galapogos, Porcelina, Lily, and By Starlight), also have the most poetic sounding lyrics. This CD is a must-have for anyone who likes the Pumpkins, rock, or just good music.

0375703764|5.0|My only regret in purchasing this book is that I bought the paperback edition.  Besides me, it has been through the hands of both of my teenagers and dozens of their friends (and their friends' parents), and the book has finally become unbound and tattered (maybe appropriately so.)  This is definitely not the read for a wimp, but if you are up to the challenge it is wickedly delicious!  I didn't laugh at all when an appraiser told me last month that my house is 1/4 inch larger inside....
B000006TRV|5.0|By the time 1979 had come Pink Floyd had a tremendous string of incredible albums. Throughout the 70s Roger Waters slowly formed the band, or tried to, into his band. Both streaks climaxed here. The Wall is an incredible album that is based upon the character Pink who loses his father in WWII and grows up to be a mentally unstable rock star as an adult. Waters writes some of his best lyrics here and there is incredible music to convey the lyrics to the listener. Waters conveys fear, paranoia, and general insanity to the listener through Pink's travels from a fearful childhood to his trip into paranoid isolation brought upon him by his protective mother, suppressive schoolteacher, and over-bearing wife. They lead him to build &quot;a wall&quot; around himself to protect him and his fragile psyche from the outside. It really is incredible as both a conceptual piece and as rock music. The true substance of this work has made it into on of rock's most celebrated releases and showed the true talent of Roger Waters and of Pink Floyd even though the other members had less input then before.
B00005JKES|5.0|Finally, I got the email notification today that I could pre-order this. And while I knew it was coming, I became flushed with excitement of having these (1-7) on dvd. I wore out my taped vhs from bravo, I wore out my box set. I need these on dvd. And now I have the opportunity. Just keep 'em coming. The prisoner shouldn't be the only great show to get the all inclusive dvd boxed set treatment. This is a great day.
B00005JKES|5.0|I just wanted to point out that the pilot will NOT be in this collection. It is just the episodes 1-7 from the first season. There is a rights issue from what I understand over the pilot (I believe Warner Brothers owns it).<br />I am still very excited to be getting this though. I hear that there will be commentary on the non-David Lynch directed episodes (he doesn't believe in it).
6304474652|4.0|This is a delightful romantic comedy. Matthew Perry is a charming, self-effacing leading man. Salma Hayek is a most fetching and winsome leading lady. Strong performances by the supporting cast help make this a most enjoyable movie.<br />Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) lives in New York and has a high powered job as a field agent for a builder that specializes in the construction of night clubs. He is sent to Las Vegas to supervise new construction. While there, he meets a fiery, latin beaty, Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek), with whom he has a very memorable one night stand. This is totally out of character for both of them. In fact, she is so embarrassed by what happened, that she sneaks out of his house first thing in the morning. Before he even knows it, she is gone, never to be heard from again, until she shows up on his door step three months later to announce that she is pregnant with his baby.<br />Alex tells her that he supports her right to choose. Isabel chooses to have the baby. She asks nothing from him other than he meet her family, so that it is not such a shock when she announces that she is pregnant. He agrees to do so. He meets her traditional, Mexican-American family and is taken by their warmth, a quality that is sorely lacking in his family. He rarely sees his own family, except for the obligatory holidays, while Isabel meets hers once a week for dinner.<br />Alex and Isabel fall in love and have a quickie marriage ceremony performed in Las Vegas. Naturally, as they are now husband and wife. they move in together. Then reality sets in. They contend with cultural difference, with pain in the you know what in-laws, and with the every day adjustments necessary, when living with someone one does not, as yet, know. Then, the trust that had developed is violated, and they each go their own separate ways.<br />What happens with the baby? Does the marriage survive? Watch the movie and find out. The experience will be an enjoyable one.
0380977281|4.0|I was given this book by a friend who introduced me to Gaiman's work in a book swap (I gave him a book I loved, he gave me a book he loved).<br />I had expected it to be miserable and dark and suffering and full of too much &quot;angst&quot; for me. Instead, it was beautiful, creative, and very funny.<br />I have made a specific effort to avoid Neil Gaimon because of all the &quot;hype&quot; around Sandman. I now realize there's a reason why people get so excited -- the man is BRILLLIANT!

6305842442|1.0|I was excited to see that the were coming out with a Limited Edition Collector's set of this film. I was excited because this is one of my favorite films and I thought this version would be loaded with extras. Well, it isn't. Not even a single commentary. Not a &quot;Making of..&quot;. Nothing. You don't even get a choice of what version you want to see, the director's cut or the original. All you get is a poster and some pictures of the film! They want us to pay almost seventy dollars for that! Forget it. I'll wait for the Extra Special Super Collector's Edition Set (If it ever comes out.) This just proves Warner Bros. is responsible for some of the worst DVD transfers ever.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This was an exceptionally good movie. Maybe the best I've watched this year. Well written and a constant surprise.<BR>Good to own a copy as it is re-watchable.
B00005631D|4.0|This was Deodato's final 70's album and a very good one. It includes some amazing tracks such as &quot;Tahiti Hut&quot;, &quot;San Juan Sunset&quot;, &quot;Chariot Of The Gods&quot; and the title track &quot;Love Island&quot;.<BR>This album includes performances by Earth Wind and Fire. this album is also very relaxing and takes you places far away when you hear it. You actually wish you were on that very Love Island that he's playing about. If you get a chance to get a hold of this album on CD definitely check it out. you will not be disappointed.

B0000584V3|5.0|This is the first Opeth album I bought and it is amazing. I am not a typical metalhead. I listen to Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd and such, but the complexities of the music are unbelievable. My roommate listened to Dirge For November, having never listened to metal before, and immediately wanted the song.  When I was introduced to metal, Opeth is what I first heard and could not get it out of my head.  I've studied music all my life and speaking from a musical stand point, these guys are geniuses
B000003TA4|4.0|DOn't get me wrong, i love nirvana!!! But this is definetly their weakest album, the one that got the attention of the pop-fans. Overall, it seems too polished. In Utero is the real Nirvana, with excellent songwriting and a more garage-feel. Polly was good, but when they followed it up with Rape Me they created the perfect anti-rape anthem. Something In the Way is the best song on the cd, as it shows Kurt Cobain's life behind the mask. This one seems very upbeat n the style, although the lyrics arent necessarily, whcih really detracts from the value of the album. Get Nevermind if you like pop, get In Utero if you like to see who Cobain really was.
B000000OE7|5.0|Having listened to this album for a period of approximately six years to date, I can say that its appeal is long lasting and it stands as one of the greats.<br />Suffering very little bearing in mind it was produced after the death of band leader Freddie Mercury - who's vocal tracks (most of them original) have been sensitively blended in with new music from the remaining members of the group, the result is a fascinating album.  <BR>With a fan club run as a multi-national company at the time of release, you may have expected it to be a simple 'cash-in' orchestrated by the record company - this is not the case.<br />The tracks on this album reveal quality.  I'm pleased to say that the classic Queen ingredients are present - lush multi-layered vocal harmonies and electric guitar, breathtaking guitar leads from the axe-master Brian May, superb vocal leads from Mercury, together with faultless musical accompaniment and strong songwriting - this is classic Queen.  The tracks range from the almighty stadium rock anthem 'Too Much Love Will Kill You', the incredibly catchy 'Heaven for Everyone' (an immense track), the wonderfully depressing 'Mother Love' as well as more refreshing tracks such as 'You don't fool me'.  This is an emotional album full of feeling and energy - as you would expect from Queen.<br />In summary this album ranks as one of the strongest Queen albums; I personally believe it is very under-rated.  Queen were just getting better and better...you would be forgiven for thinking that this album lives up to its title's claim...
B00003CXN4|5.0|The tragic events of September 11 dramatically remind us that too much time and energy have been wasted fighting the so-called war on drugs. We now have a real war against terrorists who perceive the United States as the &quot;Great Satan&quot; who must be destroyed at any cost. Director Steven Soderbergh has created a masterpiece that demands the attention of all thinking citizens. We are provided a front row view of our futile efforts to prevent drug users from acquiring mind altering substances. Michael Douglas portrays the newly appointed U.S. drug czar who quickly learns that the task is hopeless. He can't even keep his own daughter from drugs, forget about complete strangers. Steven Bauer and Catherine Zeta-Jones are convincing as a man and wife team of major drug lords who hide behind the facade of normal yuppie respectability. Miguel Ferrer stars as a mid-level drug seller who long ago realized that he is easily replaceable. Guys like him are a dime a dozen, and his possible elimination would ultimately be rendered as meaningless.<br />&quot;Traffic&quot; is held together by Benico Del Toro who eventually earned the Academy Award for this role as the Mexican undercover police officer committed to doing his thankless job. He is surrounded by corruption, and must exercise extraordinary virtue to prevent being likewise seduced by promises of great wealth and power. Del Toro interacts with virtually all the characters in this story. The war on drugs compels him to cooperate in torturing suspects, kidnapping an alleged killer in the United States and transporting the individual illegally over the border into Mexico, and many other violations of basic civil rights. This police officer is caught between a rock and a hard place, and opts to subscribe to the dubious ethic that the end justifies the squalid means. There is no way to combat the easy availability of drugs if one abides by standard police procedures, and the minimal dictates of Western Civilization.<br />Everyone should see &quot;Traffic&quot; at least once. This is especially true for our elected officials and legal scholars. The most recent terrorist attacks upon the World Trade Center and the Pentagon have only highlighted the absurdity of our war on drugs. &quot;Traffic&quot; will force everyone to ask themselves if this pseudo on-going conflict is worthy of continuation. I think many will be converted over to my negative position on the matter.>Everyone should see &quot;Traffic&quot; at least once. This is especially true for our elected officials and legal scholars.

6305972591|1.0|Being a fan of Stephen King's works, I was willing to give this movie a try.  I was severely letdown.  This ranks as one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen.<br />The story begins as all the kids in the town of Gatlin murder all the adults.  Then two adults stumble across the town and soon find themselves stalked by the sickle-toting children.<br />I found the movie impossible to be believe.  This movie is just not scary.  I can't seem to figure how Linda Hamilton got through this movie with a straight face.<br />I read in Stephen King's biography that Stephen King declared this one of the worst movies ever made.<br />Enough said.
B000003BEV|3.0|The year 1967 was the year of psychadelic albums, introduced in 1966 on the Beatles Revolver, psychadelic songs, moved underground where bands (namely Pink Floyd) fine tuned it to art, and gave it a feel that one finds in a rave nowedays. When psychadelic music exploded into the mainstream with Sgt. Pepper and Piper at the Gates of Dawn in 1967, it was clear that a movement had begun, the Stones had dabbled with psychadelic music on Aftermath and Between the Buttons, and on Their Satanic Majesties Request they put out their answer to the two previously mentioned albums. While their effort has not lasted as long as the Beatles or Floyds masterpieces, they did put out a few good songs on this one. When i first heard 2000 light years from home i thought i was listening to a lost Pink Floyd track, the style is almost identical to that of Syd Barretts Floyd, wierd noises, a sci-fi theme, and pounding deep drums make it a great track. So if you buy this you must certainly get Sgt Pepper and Piper at the Gates of Dawn. But dont bother if you dont care for pure psychadelia.
B000003S0D|4.0|Now, I know I gave this 4 stars, but I am biased as a KC enthusiast. This is probably their worst album. Don't get me wrong, I like it; it's just that this doesn't seem to capture the spirit of the band as well as their previous or later work. I was truly looking forward to hearing Jon Anderson (I am also a YES fanatic), but was disappointed when I heard the song on which he is featured: he only sings backup vocals and is easy to miss. It is interesting to note that this was just a short time before Bill Bruford would leave YES to join KC.<BR>In short, if you are not a big KC fan, this won't be of much interest to you. But, if you can't get enough Frippisms (like me), then this will be a treat. You can't have a KC collection without it.
B00005A46T|5.0|I really found nothing wrong with Slipknot's self-titled album. I mean I do agree that these guys don't have alot of talent in some areas, but the energy that they bring to the table is just incredible. So I was skeptical about their new album entitled IOWA. Well everybody that says that these guys have sold out and that they suck, can stick it up their ... Slipknot have gone death metal. Pure brutality. As simple as that. I read in one review of this album that Slipknot have stuck a blood covered knife down the throats of their listeners and they are going to make you like it. I could not agree more. A perfect way to sum up Iowa. Corey Taylor(8), continues to be one of the most talented singers in metal. With his full on assault of ferocious screams and beautiful melodies, Taylor will continue to lead the attack that is Slipknot.Of course Joey Jordison(1), continues to be one of the best drummers out there, as he continues his fast pounding and full on assault.<BR>Slipknot have definitly scored a perfect 5 with me on Iowa. Its's time for people to stop disliking these guys due to the masks and jumpsuits, and it is time for people to start looking deep into the realm of savagry that is Slipknot.<br />Tracks of note: People=..., Disasterpiece, Everything Ends, The Heretic Anthem, Gently, Left Behind, The Shape, New Abortion, and Iowa
B00005M4JS|4.0|Taking place in the early 60's, &quot;Chocolat&quot; weaves together the tale of a tiny French town and one women that changed the lives of its people forever.  &quot;Chocolat&quot; may seem cute and simplistic on the outside, but if you watch carefully, you may just notice the amazing amount of symbolism used to portray lessons learned that we take for granted every day - and maybe haven't quite caught on to yet.  The movie begins by introducing the stiff, proper, tiny French town, and its even stiffer and meaner mayor.  See something your not supposed to see? Turn the other way.  Miss mass? Hide in a cave.<br />A very gypsy-like mother and daughter find haven in the tiny town, doing all that is forbidden.  What's wrong with opening a chocolate shop in the middle of Lent? What's wrong with refusing the mayor's invitation to the Sunday preach? Why does she have to wear black when there's a flaming red dress in the closet? Slowly, the women begins to tempt passerbys into her chocolate shop (which, by the way, is VERY good), all the while earning the hatred of the mayor.  When she becomes associated with the so-called &quot;river rats&quot;, the mayor despises her all the more.  There must be an end to this 'madness' and he's nearly suceeded in putting the chocolatry out of business for good. <br />How will a tiny chocolate shop survive in a town such as this? Will Josefine ever face up to her husband? Will the little boy Luke see the light in his grandmother and break away from his protective mother? Will the river rats suffer an untimely fate? Pop &quot;Chocolat&quot; in your VCR to find out.
B00003CXN4|4.0|I had a hard time deciding whether Traffic or Crouching Tiger was the finest film of 2000.  I decided that Traffic was #2 ONLY because it's difficult to watch it multiple times, and the impact is not as powerful the second time around.  That being said, this is an amazing film.  Traffic explores 3 distinct sides of the drug problem in the United States: Trafficking, Use/Abuse, and Control.  It's amazing to see this topic portrayed even handedly.  This film certainly does not support the current method of drug control, but additionally, does not suggest legalization.  It does show what a negative impact illegal drugs have had on our society.  Some may be disturbed by the disjointed narrative: 3 distinct stories that abut each other, but do not intertwine.  The film is well worth the attention required to appreciate it though.  The image on the DVD is superior, but it lacks special features that would be welcome.  Certainly a commentary from Soderbergh would have been welcome.  Perhaps we'll see a special edition at a later date.
B00005J6UP|4.0|I have loved this movie for years, and snapped up the DVD.  The plot merely gives a vehicle for the antics of these talented and often hilarious children.  This version provides outtakes (which to me seemed wisely cut) the awful Cindy Lauper video, (which goes on and on), and a making of short.  I'd loved it when I was younger, and now I get to see my own children giggling uncontrollably over it.  Good fun and nothing but.
0345350499|5.0|i just wanted to say i absolutely loved this book. I've always been interested in arthurian legends as i was born in england. But i actuallly chose to read the mists of avalon for an assignment in art? hard to explain but i used morgaine as my focus, shown the way this book depicts her (as a wise priestess) and the way others depicts her (evil witch). I wanted to reccomend the other books in this series The forests of Avalon, lady of avalon, and Priestess of Avalon. Now i'm not quite sure of the order but i think it goes, Forest of avalon, lady of avalon then mists of avalon. prietess of avalon is the newest out so naturally i had to read it last.
1577311523|5.0|Philosophers like Krishnamurti say that the path of spiritual enlightenment starts with being aware of one's own thoughts. Commentators (of Upanishads and Gita) such as Swami Chinmayananda suggest that spiritual enlightenment is attained when the mind quietens. I have great respect for the above authors. However, I was frustrated for a long time as &quot;watching my thoughts&quot; and &quot;quietening the mind&quot; seemed impossible to achieve.<br />In this book, Tolle gives very practical advice on how we can watch our thoughts - the idea is to simply live in the present, in the Now. &quot;...Make it your practice to withdraw attention from past and future whenever they are not needed. Step out of the time dimension as much as possible in everyday life. If you find it hard to enter the Now directly, start by observing the habitual tendency of your mind to want to escape from the Now...&quot; is a brilliant piece of advice from the book.<br />The book is organised in a question-and-answer format and it is easy to read.<br />When we start reading the book, many questions rise in our heads. E.g. <BR>*How can we forget the past? Doesn't past influence on our current situation? <BR>* How can we not think about the future? How do we, then, plan for the future? <BR>*How practical is it to ignore the time (future)? <BR>All these questions and many other questions that come to mind while reading are answered in the book.<br />If you plan to read this book please think about the following: many of us read books like these and find them 'interesting'. As long as we are reading the book we feel inspired and we live in the Now. A while later, we go back to our routine and forget about living in the Now. To get the true benefit from this book, my suggestion is to create some measures so that you are reminded of the principles regularly. Some things you can do:<br />*Write down your questions, their answers and your other thoughts that come to mind, while reading the book. Review these regularly. <BR>*Find people who are interested in discussing the issues relating to spiritual enlightenment and discuss. <BR>*Make it a point to read or listen to books that relate to living the Now, on a regular basis.
6302787300|4.0|Questions of the morality of invading a foreign land and claiming it for God seem to be answered only by the viewer. Columbus dreams of finding land; of a conquest and adventure. He dreams of a new route to reveal treasures and paradise in distant lands. This movie chronicles the first two landmark voyages in a sweeping and unhurried film journey.<br /><br />Had less time been spent on the cinematic qualities, more details could have been included. The slow pace almost lends itself to philosophical questioning; giving the viewer time to contemplate the sheer magnitude of the adventure. It is as if you are taking the journey yourself.<br /><br />Beautiful lines about how power given so effortlessly can be easily taken away or, how we carry heaven and hell wherever we go, makes us all look deeper into our souls to find out what we ourselves are made of.<br /><br />Columbus is often told he is a failure, but to himself he never is. Although he seems ill fated in keeping the peace, he somehow survives to see a new day. The contrast between the goodness of man and the evilness of a man's heart is portrayed in one blow when Moxica chooses evil over good. The result is disastrous and savage warfare breaks out, revealing man's animal nature. There are scenes of brutality I fast forwarded through. This is definitely not for children and should have been rated R for those aspects alone.<br /><br />The scenes of sailing are lusciously filmed. There is some comedy at the beginning when you will laugh out loud if you are watching closely. The love between Columbus and his wife was hardly touched upon and could have been so much more dramatic, yet was very romantic. The chemistry between Columbus and the Queen is tantalizingly amusing. He knows how to charm a woman and earns the Queen's respect because he doesn't fear her power.<br /><br />Gerard Depardieu is ideal as Columbus, his accent is mesmerizing, but do turn up the volume to hear what he is saying. He comes across as thoughtful and courageous although he has his moment of deceit before taking his first voyage in that he really is not sure how far away land will be. He not only takes his life into his own hands, but expects all who follow him to dream with him.<br /><br />One can only gain more respect for Columbus as a man, yet less respect for ourselves and for our need to overthrow each other in a struggle for power. You will learn something about human nature, and about navigating the waters of life.<br /><br />A poignant story that will arouse within you the desire to spread your own wings and fly to distant lands to conquer you own need to explore the world. You may not have the patience to watch this twice, but seeing this once guarantees you will never forget it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewas his moment of deceit before taking his first voyage in that he really is not sure how far away land will be.

B000002LVB|5.0|Ever been caught by surprise by an album from a band you thought you knew?  Well I have heard a lot of VU and always thought it was pretty good, but I never bought this one because I thought I had enough VU and I hated the cover.  When I put it on I was amazed... this is a great album, maybe their best.  If you are uncertain about what to by from this band try Loaded, it will become a favorite and stand the test of time.
0375815252|1.0|After having read Charlie and Chocolate Factory after seeing the movie based upon it, I was happy to discover that there was a sequel.  I immediately checked this book from the library and started reading it right away.  Needless to say - I was very disappointed.<br />The plot of book is, truthfully and bluntly, quite stupid.  It was sequel made for the purpose of having sequel.  Don't waste your time reading this book.
6305537313|4.0|Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard are two attractive young people who live parasitic, unfulfilled lives on the fringes of high society.  Peppard's Paul Varjak is struggling to make ends meet while he writes; Hepburn's Holly Golightly is simply struggling to fend off loneliness and the panic attacks caused by her precarious future.  They find each other and a very touching love story unfolds, culminating in a wonderful rain-drenched finale.  It loses a star from me because of Mickey Rooney's offensively stereotypical performance as Mr. Yunioshi, the Japanese landlord.  His inclusion is especially stupid because the character has no useful function in the story whatsoever.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Often droning and fairly mechanical, Radiohead (despite the comparisons to neo-prog rockers like Pink Floyd and King Crimson)<BR>are a truly modern band, definable only by our current geo-social landscape. Weird textures, trampled mutterings, off kilter paeons to cars and capitalism...Radiohead are the consumate art band for the new millenium, having resoundingly broken away from their guitar oriented roots to explore I-Mac soul. If in the past Pablo Honey was heavily influenced by U2, and Thom Yorke's hair was heavily influenced by Flock Of Seagull's, Amnesiac finds them standing on the abyss as purveyors of a new jargon; one dotted with blips and beeps and brand new black suits and pale complexions honed on rainy British beaches. They may well create some of the least sexy music since the ill fated John Tesh/Yanni collaboration, but perhaps all this is ultimately what makes them important. These are not sexy times we live in after all. Human experiences and the wild veracity of youth have been replaced with the steady humming of circuitry and living vicariously through rapidly developing technology. This is anti-rock n'roll, a tremendously blatant warning about the growing fear and despair brought about by our own willful isolation from ourselves. Nothing lately has more succinctly captured that feeling of loneliness and inuhmaity than this icy blast of melancholic virtual reality. Listen to it as a soundtrack for alien fashion shows. Listen to it as the accompanying backround for a million science fiction novels. Listen to it as hymns for a newly minted modern form of spirituality. Just listen to it.
630027120X|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful, moving movies I have ever seen in my life.  The film is a trenchant examination of actual events in South America during the 1600s.  The movie deals with the Spainish and Portugeuse politics on slave trading, and a Jesuit Mission which is caught right in the middle.<br />I have never been a big Jeremy Irons fan, but his performance in this film was absolutely sensational.  Robert Deniro delivers a his usual high-quality job, and the venerable Liam Neason rounds out a high-octane cast.  In addition, Aidan Quinn stands out in a small but important role.<br />I dare say that this production was well worth all of the hoopla afforded it by the Cannes film festival.  I admit that I am normally disinterested in awards given to movies, but this one was deserving of all the homage paid to it.  It is one of the most well-done movies I have ever seen, and the cinematography ranks up there with &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; and &quot;The Last Of The Mohicans.&quot;  It also features the best soundtrack of Ennio Morcionne's career.  In fact, it is more than just a soundtrack, it is music that actually helps to tell the story.<br />In a word, this movie is unforgettable.  It delves into ethics, politics and the horrifying prospect of human slavery like few films have ever done.  Despite its religious overtones I can't help but think that even the most die-hard atheists would be hard-pressed to be unmoved by this movie.  It's just that gripping.

0679746048|4.0|Girl, Interrupted is an autobiography about a teenage author in the 60's who was admitted into a mental hospital for a borderline personality disorder.  We found this book to be an interesting story of the psychology of the mind.  We felt that this book was well-written, serious, and, at times, ironically funny.  As teenagers, we found that the author's mind was revealed in a dark labirynth of a teenage mind.  We recommend this book to anyone from teenage girl-age to adults, or to anyone who is interested in the challenge of the woman's mind.  One thing to keep in mind is that the book is written out of order, which makes it a bit confusing, until you realize that that is part of her disease.  This gives the book a unique flair and an interesting view of her disorder.  We highly recommend it.
0805062971|3.0|I feel I should start off this review by saying that I bought and read this book because I enjoyed the movie so much (and it's rare when I actually like a movie I see).  In every case, when I watch a movie and read the book version, the book version is superior.  However, this is not the case for &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  My biggest problem with the book was the genre in which it is written.  The narrative is quick, with short paragraphs, constantly shifting between describing the action and waxing philosophy (more on that later).  This technique made it difficult for me to empathize with the unnamed main character.  While Palahniuk did succeed in making me feel the despair and frustration of insomnia, it was much more difficult to understand the tragedy of having a split personality, knowing that you're being followed and tracked, or the frustration that must accompany why strangers are calling you &quot;sir&quot; and treating you with uncommon respect.  Also, the most interesting and developed character is Marla.  While I do appreciate her character, I would have preferred a more developed main character or Tyler Durden.<br />There are, however, some very good aspects of the book as well.  I have read this book being compared to &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; and &quot;On the Road&quot; because it's so representative of my generation (indeed, the quick pace reminded me of &quot;On the Road&quot;).  In many ways, I agree with this comparison as Palahniuk addresses many issues and frustarations unique of Generation X:  being bombarded by violence; constant pressure from advertisers and commercialism; empty feelings that result from a consumer culture; the fact that we are &quot;a generation of men raised by women&quot; and thus have a self-identity conflict and others.  While I can't identify with Tyler Durden's rant that we are &quot;God's middle children,&quot; without a special place in history and that it would be better for us to be noticed for being bad than not be noticed at all, I imagine that many in my generation can identify with that remark.  In all, I would recommend the book to members of my generation as it addresses topics that the movie does not, but I would also strongly advise you to watch the movie first and to talk to others about the topics raised.  It can't help but assist us in making sense of our generation and our time.t be noticed at all, I imagine that many in my generation can identify with that remark.

B00004SYWZ|5.0|I have been following A-ha since 1985 when Take On Me hit the top of the charts. This CD marks their entrance into the 21st century with some of their best work yet. They really have evolved into a mature band that you can start out liking in high school and still enjoy their new releases into your thirties. My favs on this CD include &quot;Summer Moved On&quot; and &quot;The Sun Never Shone That Day&quot;.... However, I think the track &quot;You'll Never Get Over Me&quot; is one of the best. Even in its simplicity it has a kind of depth to it. The way Lauren Savoy's vocals slowly emerge from the instruments throughout the song is brilliant. This is a must for all who have followed or forgotten about A-ha. I hope they release some of the tracks here and get back on the American scene.
B00003CXSP|3.0|While I enjoyed the movie, the way the &quot;cut&quot; scenes were presented was a disappointment. They were not included in the movie where they should have been, but instead were placed in a separate section. Sometimes it was difficult to tell where they actually would have been in the movie.

074322454X|5.0|Band of Brothers is a great read about the men Easy Company as they crossed Europe in WWII.  It always surprises me when people attack Ambrose for his use of interviews with the men who were there.  I don't see why people insist that history must be written looking only at quartermaster records, officer journals, or the opinions of those who were never there.  People gripe about the insignificant details totally discounting the recollections &amp; emotions of those present. The debate in trivia misses the whole point.  And the idea that a state side army record is more reliable than the word of a soldier in the field is questionable.  We are very lucky to have a book using truly original sources instead of depending solely on archival sources.  Ambrose's writing style is also criticized.  If his writing attracts those who are usually turned off by history books, I think that is great.  It is important for every to be educated in history, not feel threatened because a history writer has a mainstream following outside of academic circles.  If you want a griping account of what our fathers or grandfathers faced in WWII this is your book.
0767802659|4.0|With director Paul Verhoeven at the helm of a film, you never know what you're up against. As a storyteller, his sense of direction tends to be hit-or-miss; some turn out fine, while other flounder. As a director, his sense of over-the-top style and dazzling special effects provide viewers with a like-it-or-hate-it experience, even saving some of his films from failure.<br />&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is a special case, a movie so gawdy and ridiculous, so over-the-top in effects and lacking in logical plot that many who see it will be divided down the middle. For me, the movie works, due to the fact that since the story is sheer sci-fi hokum, you can put it all aside and just enjoy the spectacular roller coaster Verhoeven has crafted, a thrill-ride of rollicking visual effects and action stunts that inspire laughter in all the right ways.<br />The film's beginning is slow and monotonous, as it introduces us to the characters and sets up the conflict. We meet several students at a futuristic high school, on the verge of their graduation and parting ways. It begins with Carmen (Denise Richards) and Johnny (Casper Van Dien) being in love, trying to make it work as they part to train and become troopers, though Carmen gets the wandering eye for a fellow pilot, and they part ways.<br />As all of this happens, a race of alien bugs, which inhabit a distant planet, have sent an asteroid to Earth, which destroys Buenos Aires, the hometown of Johnny and Carmen, who, along with the entire Starship Troopers force, wage war on the bugs, landing on their planet on a mission to wipe them out.<br />The story is small on development, which will turn away those looking for logical plot twists and lucid storytelling. &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is concerned with neither of the two, and instead chooses to focus on the elements of excitement, humor, and satire. And for the most part, this gamble pays off, delivering on many of these promised elements while leaving the plot in its wake.<br />I'll come right out and say it: the action is tremendous, big on special effects while low on tension and connection. This is due to the absence of story, but it hardly seems to matter. This is Verhoeven's canvas, and he turns it into a playground for some very stunning visuals that are as exciting as they are completely cheesy (even a five-year-old could tell that the bugs are fake).<br />But, for some reason, it all seems to work. There are scenes that provide a reaction of awe and wonder, such as a scene in which a missile is fired into a bug cavern, creating a tremendous explosion that does all but leave you sitting still. Lots of gunfire, running, chase scenes, bloodshed, mayhem, and explosions keep the energy at a high. These scenes work because their unbelievability and silly conception are so humorous that you can't help but go along with the gimmick.<br />There are even elements of satire present, involving the use of propaganda and images that look like something out of a futuristic World War II. The movie plays like a promotional campaign for enrollment in the armed services, and Verhoeven shows no shame in interspersing such videos throughout the film. Throughout all of the movie, there also seems to be a sense of surreal patriotism that is corny and clichéd, but works delightfully with the rest of the material.<br />I walked into &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; expecting less than what I came away from it with, and it proved itself a satisfactory sci-fi adventure film. The story is bad, but the effects and virtuoso direction of Verhoeven make this a film for those who consider substance a distraction from style. Just go along with it, leaving scrutiny behind, and the movie works.
B0000214G6|2.0|9 1/2 WEEKS reminded me of that birds and bees joke. That's where the Dad told the son about sex in very graphic terms, finishing by asking, &quot;Have you got any questions?&quot; Then the kid says, &quot;Yeh, Dad. How do you keep from laughing?&quot; Well, this movie was a little bit funny about the sex parts. A guy on a bar stool sort of blushed when Basinger and Rourke engaged in some foreplay at the bar. Mostly, however, the movie &quot;story&quot; was demeaning to women. It was not entertaining. It was boring. I give it two stars because of the locations. The movie shows off a side or two of New York City, and the evening photography was excellent.
0151003084|5.0|Terrific satire of the morality tales of days past. We laugh now, but books like this were actually read to young children to warn them of the woes of society and the wages of living like children. This books take up where those books left off and turns it up a notch. Very humorous rhymes and sometimes chilling drawings, but for the most part the situations are ridiculous enough to laugh at, particularily the child who dies of ennui. Edward Gorey's drawings call to mind the art of Charles Addams, though even darker if you can beleive that! If you enjoy dark satire then you will enjoy this book. If you find yourself to be extremely sensitive then don't even bother to pick it up.
B00003CXWU|4.0|First off I have to say I agree with all the reviews here. This movie was a real nice surprise and I enjoyed it a lot. Many folks have been comparing it to movies like Goodfellas and Scarface. While I agree with these comparisons I noticed the use of violent scenes in Blow is much less than these other examples. It never turns into a &quot;blood bath&quot;, but you almost expect it too. The few violent scenes give you a flavor for the type of people involved with drug tafficing and then adds to the increasingly paranoid and tragic feel of the movie the further along it goes. I think this a more effective use of violence in movies...a tool for setting a tone. Another reviewer also made a good point about the movie not showing the effects of getting hooked on drugs. I agree here too as George's own drug problem was quickly glossed over.
B000003S0I|4.0|Well worth it for people who like interesting rock music. A grower, it might take a few listens. Bruford left Yes to join crimson, it seems like a good move because he can show his talents more. Apparently this album was a bit of a nightmare to record. Larks part 2 rocks hard and the tune was used in a film.  There's lots of interesting pecussion tricks and good bass playing. Robert Fripp steals the show with his Easy Money guitar showcase. Some nice ballads and long instrumentals too. Worth getting. thank you
0399146253|1.0|I hated this book, but not for the reason I expected. Black Notice was so dark and depressing that I expected this one to be even more so.  Actually, it was so sloppy and unbelievable that I just couldn't get involved in the plot.<br />Aside from rather uninteresting introspection into Kay's personal history, this entire book consisted of rewriting the plot of two previous novels (Point of Origin, Black Notice) into an even more complicated conspiracy... and setting us up for future (and probably even more unbelievable) conspiracies in the next book.<br />My proposed plot for the next one, at least as plausible as the conspiracies, is this:  Kay awakes in a mental institution, receiving therapy for her delusions of grandeur, paranoia, and possibly multiple personality disorder.  She really did kill Diane Bray, but was found not guilty by reason of insanity.  The rest of the conspiracy was the product of her paranoia.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I have already written a review on this incredible movie, but I accidentally made it a private review.  Over time, however, it made me furious to find 1-star reviews here, and so I decided I should write another review.<br />The theme of this review is that &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; is NOT an average Disney cartoon by any means.  It's very different for a variety of reasons.<br />1) The storyline.  No 5-year-old kid could ever understand the storyline to this film.  It's about a young prince who was cursed by a demon that attacked his village.  After he killed the demon, the prince discovered that the curse is a curse of hatred that comes from the west.  He must go and stop the evil that is going on in the west, to &quot;see with eyes unclouded by hate.&quot;  Otherwise, the curse will kill him.  The rest I leave to you, but the basic point is that the flim is about love and hate, joy and sorrow, and human life and death.<br />2) The dialogue.  The script in this film is truly unforgettable, with quotes like: &quot;You cannot alter your fate my prince, however you can rise to meet it if you choose&quot;, and &quot;Now watch closely everyone, I'm going to show you how to kill a god.  A god of life and death.  The trick is not to fear him.&quot;<br />3) The violence.  Yes, there is enough violence in this film to merit a PG-13 rating, and although an arrow doesn't NORMALLY chop arms off, it just goes to show that when hatred takes over someone, it can really make them crazy.<br />4) There's no real &quot;good guy&quot; or &quot;bad guy&quot;.  Although San wanted to protect her forest, she and her wolves also killed the husbands of many of the women in Irontown.  And although Lady Eboshi wanted to destroy the forest for iron, she also cared for the lepers of Irontown and was very loving to her people.  And the prince doesn't side with either one of them, he just wants to make peace so his curse will be removed.<br />5) The length of the film.  It is 134 minutes long.<br />6) The animation.  It is absolutely incredible.  It took three years to create this film, and they were not wasted.  The Nightwalker is absolutely an amazing sight to behold!  And when the prince entered the magical forest, he said, &quot;This place is magical.&quot;  I said the exact same thing.  I forgot I was watching a cartoon.  I forgot I was watching a movie.  I even forgot my own name.  It was that breathtaking!  (Oh, and by the way, the dubbing was done along with RE-ANIMATING the mouth movements to match the English language!)<br />Bottom Line: If this STAGGERINGLY good movie ISN'T so good that it makes you forget everything as you watch it, then my name isn't....uh....uh....uh....
0684833395|4.0|I have somewhat mixed feelings on this book. While is is a great study into the insanity of war and has many truly hillarious moments, this book just doesn't flow. You'll be reading about Yossarian's present problems and suddenly you will be reading about some incident that happened in the past, and there won't be so much as a transition, then you will be right back to the present. This is why I gave it 4 stars.<br />On the other hand, this is an excellent satire on war and its insanity, and is laugh-out-loud funny. The book follows a crazy bombardier named Yossarian who is uncanny for pointing out paradoxes and contradictions in the modern psyche. Yossarian wants to get out of the war, and he pursues several avenues, but is thwarted on one end by a neurotic, brown-nosing Colonel Cathcart, and on the other by the melancholy, and also neurotic, Doc Daneeka, who will not allow him to get of by reason of mental defect. I wish I could post a funny line that had me laughing, but there were really few individual lines like that. Mostly there were exchanges between Yossarian and the people he meets. This book is not beach reading: you have to really concentrate to see what's going on. But it was a fine read nonetheless.
B000001DTM|5.0|If you're thinking where to begin your U2 exploration, don't hesitate any more. Start with one of rock's landmark albums - &quot;ACHTUNG BABY&quot;, U2s best and hardest album to date. This one has everything a good U2 album has: strong lyrics by Bono, terrific guitar work by The Edge, hard drumming by Larry and smooth bass lines from Adam. Come to think of it, this was the first and for now only U2 album that had all of these things in one place (&quot;THE JOSHUA TREE&quot; is near by, but it's not as passionate as &quot;AB&quot;).<br />It starts of with a bang, a song called  &quot;Zoo Station&quot;, the best beginning of an U2 album. If you hear the lyrics close you'll see a strong message of what U2 were thinking of doing at that time - they knew they scored big time with &quot;TJT&quot;, but also screwing up big time with &quot;RATTLE AND HUM&quot;, an album that almost ruined their carrier. So U2 knew it had to do something new, something that will transform their sound from the 80's on through the 90's. And they did that fantastically.<br />The entire album it's excellent, there isn't a bad song to be found. The Edge is having the performance of his life (just listen to &quot;Even better than the real thing&quot;, &quot;Until the end of the world&quot; and &quot;The fly&quot;) - amazing solos and fantastic riffs. Bono's lyrics are surprisingly good (everyone knows lyrics are U2's weak side). But &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Acrobat&quot; and &quot;Love is blindness&quot; are without any doubt one of U2's best lyrics. And &quot;One&quot;, that song is pure poetry, one the most recognizable and most famous U2 song. And it has every right to be - it's beautiful.<br />If you still don't have it, get it. You won't be sorry.<BR>And if you listen to the album closely, you just might find your self in these songs.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|As the year progresses there have been many surprises, but far more dissapointments... Earlier this year I stopped by my uncles theater to see a movie with virtually no publicity, hoping the movie would live up to my uncles recommendations.<br />This turned out to be, by FAR the best movie to come out this year. The story is about a man who suffered a severe trauma during a tragic event involving his wife. He ends up with what is described as a lack of short term memory, he can remember the big picture... Who he is, where he's from and what has happened up to a moment... from then on he can only leave himself hints as to what has happened.<br />The narrative is told in reverse, bassically you start in what appears to be a series of episodes starting from the end and culminating in what appears to be the cause of the events. Forcing the viewer to play close attention to the events as they unfold, putting you in almost the same situation as the protaganist himself... you end up trying to keep track of everything that's going on without anything there to remind you.<br />All I can say is this movie is well worth at least one viewing, if that is not enough for you to make this purchase... nothing will ;).
6305622930|5.0|Like all the critics say, this is the best motion picture biography that was ever made. Every thing, right down to the pearl gripped guns, is right. This movie is truly amazing, it maintains interest for almost three hours? The movie begins with Patton in North Africa, fighting against German General Erwin Rommel during World War II. It then moves on to battles in Sicily and Europe. The tank battles are the best that Hollywood has ever filmed. There is no reason why any history buff should not have this movie. It is without a doubt one of the best war movies ever made, and has George C. Scott in the best role of his life.
0812550757|5.0|Ender's game was one of the best books I had read in a while, and Speaker for the Dead surpassed even that.  Not only is the book a fascinating story, but Card wrestles with some very deep philosophical musings on coexistance.  The _Fantasy Review_ quote on the back says it all: &quot;The most powerful work Card has produced.  SPEAKER not only completes Ender's Game, it transcends it.&quot;  Though Card suggests that Speaker for the Dead can stand on its own as a novel (his intention from the start), I disagree.  I think the character development and the history of Ender Wiggin as presented in Ender's Game is vastly important to really grasping Speaker.
B000006TRV|5.0|I got the cd today and its truly moving and a masterpiece at least.  It deseves 7 stars.  It has flaws, but i do not skip a single track ever.  Pink Floyd at its best.
B00000K31V|5.0|This movie was positively amazing. Much in the tradition of 13th Floor and Dark City the movie challenges reality leaving you to question whether or not you are entirely comfortable with what you consider it to be.  Very thought provoking with positively amazing imagery and effects throughout the movie. A must see for everyone.
0140284087|5.0|These ten short Jeeves and Wooster tales originally appeared in 1925 and three-quarters of a century later provide an excellent entry point to Wodehouse's comic series. The Jeeves and Wooster stories generally follow the same template, the young, wealthy airhead Wooster or one of his upper-crust pals gets in some sticky social situation, and it is up to his genius butler Jeeves to devise an ingenious solution to the quandary. Often the stories involve some manner of deception, misunderstanding, or often, mistaken identity-and sometimes, Jeeves' scheme backfires, resulting in even greater hilarity (although as with every comic tale, all is set right by the end). The stories can fairly be compared to contemporary TV sitcoms, as they to reply on recurring (often over the top) characters, a rarefied setting, a single type of humor, and recurring situations. Simply put, if you like one Wooster story (and don't get sick of them), you're going to like them all. Much of this can be explained by Wodehouse's mastery of the language and constant deft turns of phrase, period slang, and comic timing. Those who deride the shallow subject matter and milieu of the Jeeves and Wooster series need to recall the context in which these stories appeared. Only a few years removed from the horrors of World War I-an event that is never alluded to in the series, despite the loss of an entire generation of British young men-the stories can be viewed as a bandage of sorts, an attempt to transport the reader to a world far removed from the traumatic recovery from the Great War. Not to mention Wodehouse's clear depiction of the upper classes as wastrels and idiots of the highest order when compared to the street savvy of the servants (as exemplified by Jeeves). Of course, one doesn't read Wodehouse for social commentary or as a salve these days, but for his dry wit and keen command of the written word.
B000001FLI|4.0|Reticient Roy Buchanan was precisely what he cracked himself up to be: just an ordinary fellow with nothing all that much to say (other than his puckish taste for spinning some tall tales about his birth and childhood) - until you put a guitar in his hands. His genuine unease with fame (matched best in his own era by Mike Bloomfield) gave his striking guitar playing a little extra and often harrowing edge, which served his deeply individualistic meld of blues and country musics in a manner which couldn't be duplicated if anyone tried.<br />Plenty enough did try, of course; this recluse was influential beyond his self-imposed scope. (Consider: Jeff Beck, for one, dedicated &quot;Cause We've Ended as Lovers&quot; on his resurrective &quot;Blow By Blow&quot; to Buchanan, whom Beck admitted emulating for his sleek but soulful excursion on that much-admired track.) His first official Polydor album (the label had rejected his first try at a first album, spurning his wish to pump it like he loved it on his home turf, rejecting the obvious call for guitar-slinging strut and jive; in fact, the label actually contemplated suing him for breach of contract over it) delivered the goods for the most part and then some, though Buchanan sometimes gets in his own way. When he doesn't it's exhilarating music even with that trebly-to-the-third-power sound of his worn Telecaster: &quot;I Am A Lonesome Fugitive&quot; could have been (and still seems) at least as autobiographical as Buchanan's near-signature, haunted-mountain blues lope, &quot;The Messiah Will Come Again,&quot; which is itself a stop-the-clock proposition even if Buchanan's vocal recitation sounds more like he's trying to convince himself. <br />But &quot;John's Blues&quot; is downright shattering, Buchanan crunching one after another line of pure deep emotion with such commitment that even when he's only too obvious (his one wounding flaw: he had superlatively advanced technique and often could not resist letting it ride over pure music feeling; granted, he would find himself often enough in imposed music settings which must have felt suffocating or insane,even if he could and usually did hold his own) the soul overcomes. <br />That tension, plus his sometimes-inability to decide his music (he often seemed as though he couldn't make up his mind whether he was a bluesman, a country picker - though you'd take on the dichotomy, too, if you could wring out as gripping a version of &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; as Buchanan's - or a kind of fusionesque nomad) would stay with Buchanan throughout his life. But in due course he would recover his truest root and make music equal to that root's best exercises here. By any accounting - of his style or his life - Roy Buchanan was born to play the blues.

B00005NOZ6|5.0|This album is yet another in a long list of masterpieces from DT, proving once again that they are one of the best live acts around. I've had the priviledge to have seen them on the Images and Words tour and can say they have gotten better with every year. <BR>As for the album art, I have a different view of it. According to their FAQ the symbol is &quot;....a copy of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The barbed wire represented obstacles and difficulties, the heart endurance and strength, and the fire (their) energy and passion.&quot; With the skyline of NY in the background (burned forever in our memories)these are the exact qualities that the U.S. has that will insure that we prevail in this dark hour of our history.

B00004Y6NU|5.0|Love over gold es uno de esos discos en los que se confirma lo importante que es el armado de una obra como una GRAN OBRA CONCEPTUALMENTE  hablando, no simplemente la recoleccin de distintos temas en un \\"greatest hits\\", cosa que asegurara grandes ventas, pero a la vez grandes injusticias con temas excluidos de ellas por sellos discogrficos(nunca por sus autores). Y Dire Straits no es la excepcin, es una gran banda y este disco es una gran muestra de ello. Telegraph road (1), esta perfectamente diagramado, los cambios de ritmo parecen matematicamente planeados, solos de guitarra perfectamente alternados con silencios y un potente piano que hacen que el tema paresca mas corto que los  12 minutos que realmente dura. De Private Investigations (2) que puedo decir, es ese tema que nos cambia el nimo y hasta fisicamente (en la piel y los ojos). Pero como Dire Straits es esa banda tan especial, rompe el clima al que se llega con los dos primeros temas(especialmente el segundo), con los potentes y festivos riffs de Industrial disease (3), el tema ms up del disco, que nos permite relajarnos y distendernos un poco , pora prepararnos para ese temaso que le da nombre al disco, Love over gold (4), que es simplemente una gran obra de arte, de esos temas para escuchar en el living con auriculares o en la ruta al amanecer, no importa, simplemente arte. Termina pronto, con It never Rains (5), y uno entiende que tenia que terminar ah, con ese tema. Esa primera inpresin que daba un disco con solo 5 temas, desaparece, y uno sabe que un disco puede ser excelente con solo? 5 grandes temas.
B000001DU5|5.0|I bought this CD three years age, long after this group's heyday and I became a fan of them instantly. This is the best hits compilation I,ve ever bought. Many people think of Shout or Everybody Wants To Rule The World when they think of TFF. While I love these songs their music spans beyond just these two songs. You'll be surprised at the changes in their sound from their Hurting Days. Pale Shelter, and Mad World are your typical but above average early 80s new wave songs. Change is a standout song from this period. Such a well produced pop song. The fuzz buzz running from 2:38 to 2:57 is amazing. The new single on here is a hard rock edged Laid So Low. This song is a rerecorded version of Tears Roll Down from the brilliant yet underrated Saturnine Martial Lunatic CD. The next surpise is the Beatles sounding Sowing The Seeds Of Love. Rolands songwriting` producing, and Curts voice and musicianship all come together to create a brilliant 6 and a half minute song. This is their most colorful song they,ve ever done with lots of horns and trumpets. The other surprise is the soulful Woman In Chains and Advice For The Young At Heart. Woman In Chains is a beautiful song with Oleta Adams singing backup and emotional well written lyrics. Her voice is breathtaking. The Final Cut on this compilation, Advice For The Young is a great closer to this album. It's very soulful with the Jazzy pianos mixed with guitars and organs it's my favorite on this album. I highly recommend that you get this CD. It will be in your CD player alot. Even if you have the parent albums this CD is still worth getting just for the new single Laid So Low(Tears Roll Down). It's worth the money.
B000002BE9|5.0|Fiona Apple is simply one of the finest vocal and songwriting talents to emerge in the world of rock recently. Tidal, her debut release, encompases not only every emotion imaginable, but also her comanding voice and beautiful lyrics.<BR>She writes with engrossing candor on failed relationships, a meloncholy that simply won't fade, and utter transcendence through it all.<BR>All of her songs are beautifully crafted and showcase her incredible voice. The orchestrations work very well and complement the ebb and flow of her emotions.<BR>This is simply a beautiful album. Literally beautiful, after hearing it for the first time, you can't help but fall for her in all of her sullen glory.

0553579908|4.0|George R. R. Martin, A Clash of Kings (Bantam Spectra,<br />1999)<br /><br />Martin continues on in his fictional depiction of the<br />Hundred Years' War. The throne has changed hands, the<br />exiled priness of the Targaryen line is marshalling<br />her forces, the Yorks-- excuse me, the Starks-- have<br />been declared the Kings in the North, and the<br />Baratheon brothers are squabbling amongst themselves<br />in the rural eastern bits of the kingdom. It all<br />sounds rather boring when put that way, but it isn't.<br />Martin has given us a worthy second installment in the<br />Song of Ice and Fire series.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting feature of Martin's<br />writing is that he's capable of juggling so many<br />different stories while enabling us to keep enough of<br />the details straight in our heads so we can pick them<br />up again easily. Most notable is the story of Daenarys<br />Targaryen, who gets very little screen time here, but<br />whose story is fleshed out immensely in book two.<br />Martin gives us quite a bit to work with in very few,<br />and very readable, words.<br /><br />Winter is coming, and I'm quite looking forward to the<br />next book in the series. ****
B000003BF1|5.0|This has got to be one of the greatest albums ever. So many great songs off one album. Gimme Shelter is a great opener and a great song, one of my Favorite Stones songs. Live with Me and Let it Bleed are also great. Midnight Rambler is haunting with great blues feel and chilling lyrics about a serial killer. You Got the Silver is a great vocal by Keef, the God of Riffs. Monkey Man is just plain awesome. Great lyrics, awesome riff, great use of piano, just a great song. You Can't Always Get What You Want is the perfect closing track with the boys chorus slowly fading. I've never thought an album could be perfect but this is. This is a work of art, that's why not one bit of it should be changed. Screw bonus tracks, this is a master piece. Would you add a tree in the background of the Mona Lisa because you thought it could use something more? than why do it to Let it Bleed?
0553573403|4.0|One wag reviewer points out that reading Martin is<br />not a good idea of you like your main characters to<br />live through the novel. While things aren't quite that<br />drastic, this is certainly a work that throws as many<br />monkeywrenches into the works as possible. And the<br />scariest part is that this is book one (of six-- and<br />the two that have come out since are both more than<br />three hundred pages longer than this one. This is all<br />setup, folks).<br /><br />Many compare this to Tolkein in its scope and subject<br />matter. I think it's a lot closer to what Elizabeth<br />Moon did in her The Deed of Paksenarrion series--<br />Martin shies away, for the most part, from the magical<br />aspect of fantasy and concentrates more on medieval<br />political intrigue and warmaking. Not to say this<br />isn't a fantasy novel, but it should certainly appeal<br />to readers of political-intrigue books (I've compared<br />it more than one to Jeffrey Archer's Kane and Abel and<br />The Prodigal Daughter) and historical nonfiction.<br />Perhaps Martin will achieve the popularity and status<br />that Moon so richly deserved and never got.<br /><br />The plot of A Game of Thrones focuses mostly on two<br />families, the Starks and the Lannisters (erm, York?<br />Lancaster?). The present King of the realm of Westron,<br />Robert Baratheon (wed to a Lannister), gets the two<br />families back at each other's throats when he asks the<br />head of House Stark, Ned, to be his right-hand man.<br />Robert and a few other well-meaning folk attempt to<br />bring peace between the two houses, but it wouldn't be<br />a six-book series if they succeeded, right? Murphy's<br />Law operates in spades here. Add in the beginnings of<br />another storyline about the last vestiges of the<br />bloodline of the Targaryens, who were forced out of<br />the country when one of the Lannisters killed King<br />Aemon, and you've got the makings for six thousand<br />pages of medieval intrigue that are sure to grab hold<br />and not let go. Which might not be the best thing in<br />the world to do if you have impatient readers, as<br />Martin is releasing books in the series at a rate of<br />approximately one every two years. My advice: read<br />slowly. You've got a while before the next book in the<br />series comes out. 4 1/2 starst not be the best thing in<BR>the world to do if you have impatient readers, as<BR>Martin is releasing books in the series at a rate of<BR>approximately one every two years. My advice: read<BR>slowly. You've got a while before the next book in the<BR>series comes out. 4 1/2 stars
B000000W5P|4.0|Well, I hate Disco, but Miss You is awesome. Great opener and is definatley not what you expected. When the Whip Comes Down is pretty cool too. Just My Imagination, Some Girls, Lies, Respectable, and Shattered are ok. Before they make me Run is a great Keith vocal with great lyrics. &quot;Booze and Pills and Powders, Choose your medicine.&quot; and &quot;Gonna find my way to heaven cause I did my time in Hell.&quot; are some of the best in the song. Beast of Burden is probley the best on the whole album. That leaves us with track 6, Far Away Eyes. I hate country, that's why I love this song. All though this is a country song, Mick just bashes country through the whole song. If you listen to the lyrics, you can tell this is a great country satire song. Definatley Not your average Rolling Stones album.
0790742780|4.0|Reviewer Maltin's query of \\"what's the point?\\" leaves me baffled. The point is that virtually every one of us can relate to the situations Douglas' character confronts and has at some point fantasized about finally cutting through it all. I thought this film was a dead-on (and often witty) commentary on contemporary society which avoided clich in its portrayal of its very human central characters. Those who could relate to this film might also want to check out the novel &quot;Arcadia Falls&quot; by Rand Johnson which, though a very different experience, is also a story of a man who finally makes a stand against a world gone wrong.
0385501560|3.0|Chuck Palahniuk is a poet in a novel sort of way. Instead of writing the mundane life of a boy who we'll eventually hate, he twists Victor Mancini into a character that we can't leave alone. <br />'Choke' is a novel about...well...sexual addiction and sexual frustration, only it doesn't stop there. Inbetween the sexcapades of our friend, Victor, we learn about his mother, his friend, his lack of imagination. His childhood, his belief system, his career.<br />'Choke' combines the wit and humour of Palahniuk's other creations and makes it breathe on it's own. The angst of one man churning the nation. We won't stop there. We'll keep spitting on those who work menial jobs and scorn those who feed their addictions daily. We'll turn hate filled little boys into Victor Mancinis.<br />A must read. If you're into that sexual addiction thing.

B0000060NH|5.0|This has a much smoother, more mellow sound than most blaxploitation soundtracks.  Hey it's Marvin Gaye what would you expect?  Limited amount of vocals probably hurt this cd in some fans eyes but I loved it!!  In it's own way, Trouble Man is the equal of the more noted soundtracks of the period.  Again if you like super smooth intrumentals this is the cd for you!  Beautiful music.  If I was to list the essential blaxploitation soundtracks I would go with SHAFT, SUPERFLY, TROUBLE MAN, and THE MACK!  The Trouble Man theme is as good as any of the other themes.  Check this out!

B00005NWM3|2.0|I loved The State, so I bought Silver Side Up with only hearing How You Remind Me. Bad move. While the album appears to be more personal with songs that seem to be about an abusive father-figure and similar - it just sounds too much like cheesy 80's rock. While I like How You Remind Me, the &quot;yeah yeah, no no&quot; repeated over and over again is tiring, and a lot of the album is like that. Its like they were grasping for rhymes and so on. I'm going to listen to it a few more times, but it doesnt compare to The State.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|All right, I have something I need to get off my chest. First, though, the review. This is incredible. While not quite in the class of Blood on the Tracks and the electric trilogy of 65-66, its still a dern fine piece of work, right next to Freewheelin', John Wesley Harding,  and Time Out of Mind, masterpieces all. Tweedle Dee is a great opener, bluesy, a little bluegrass, awesome, straight through the finale Sugar Baby, which is a song that can take it's rightful place in Dylan's canon next to the other greats. Po' Boy is a wonderful song along with the fun Summer Days, the blues rocker Lonesome Day Blues, and especially Highwater, the second best song on the album, behind the instant classic, Mississippi. This brings me to what really cheeses me. How, how I ask, can people criticize his voice? A conventional voice singing Mississippi would have made it just a good song. Dylan's voice does something to it that is unimaginable if you've heard the Sheryl Crow version. His voice is an additional instrument that no one else knows how to play. Dylan's is truly beautiful singing. This voice is a world-weary, but I've survived dangnabbit voice and is truly a revelation. Feel free to follow Ricky Martin and his crew of phonies who are destroying American music, if that's your thing; eventually you'll find that road leads nowhere and long after they're gone, Dylan will remain.
0679721037|3.0|Precise, journalistic overview of the events at ground zero when Hiroshima was bombed. I had hoped the book would deal more with the emotional effects of the bombing on its victims (and there is a bit of that), but mostly it's a factual account. That said, I recommend it. It's such an important historical document, especially if you're an American, that it's worth an hour and a half of your time.
B00005NKW4|5.0|Charming, well-acted and well produced. The child star is excellent. While some items are unreal, the story is so strong that it suspends reality. Opens avenues for discussing human relationships and adult interactions. The best. Entirely held kids' attention. Made them feel sad and then happy. &quot;Pretty cool.&quot;  Best for ages 8 to 12.
B00005B6N7|1.0|This film is boring,factually inaccurate and complete rubbish!If you want a good underwater adventure,try The hunt for Red October or Crimson tide and avoid this trash at all costs!
B00004TJTQ|5.0|Full of coming-of-age themes with plenty for kids to talk about: love, loss, creativity, and growing up. Good representation of the forties. Brings up civil rights issues. Kids were attentive to the issues presented. &quot;It showed how a boy could love a dog so much.&quot; The ending is very sad, most felt that the dog didn't need to die. &quot;Friendship is important even between people and their pets.&quot; Best for ages 8 to 12.
B00004TFK3|4.0|What a movie, that's all I can say. Will Smith is at his comedic best in this sci-fi movie that for about 10 seconds makes you actually think. This is a great no brainer movie to watch, so when you are ready to relax and watch a funny movie, watch MIB. Tommy Lee Jones is an unknown and non-existing agent for a non existent and unknown law enforcement/immigrations officer for illegal and legal aliens...Extra-terrestial aliens. At the end of this movie it has you looking at that guy down the street wondering if inside that humanoid body is a little alien with controls like a car. Will Smith is a NYPD detective with an attitude and a big head, but he is in for piece of humble pie as Jones takes him into his world!
0790720434|5.0|This is a wonderful, universal story. The content is appropriate to this audience. Kids identify with characters on many levels - losing parents, being part of a family and learning to understand feelings. Stimulates students' creativity. Kids are inspired and moved by the emotions present in each of the characters. &quot;No matter what your problems are, you can overcome them.&quot; &quot;It must have been taped in a big garden. It was neat.&quot; &quot;Awesome, it was the best video ever.&quot; Best for ages 8 to 12.
0425179877|5.0|As a &quot;space Junky&quot; I love to learn about the early days of the space program.  Its awesome to read about the way NASA started and all the risks and worries of our first space pioneers.  Gene Kranz writes in a matter of fact way but provides first hand experience that I doubt you'd ever read anywhere else!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I am giving this an extremely enthusiastic 5 star rating for this reason: you can enjoy this album all the way through at work, driving home from school/work, you can listen to it while you study, and listen to it to go to sleep and enjoy different parts of it at this different instances.  If you wanna tap to the blues beat in the car listen to &quot;Lonesome Day Blues,&quot; &quot;Summer Days&quot; and &quot;Honest with Me.&quot;  If you like melancholy music listen to &quot;Mississippi,&quot; &quot;Bye and Bye,&quot; &quot;Moonlight,&quot; &quot;Po'Boy.&quot;  I honeslty cannot give any of these songs a bad rating.  The one thing I notice and probably why I love this album so much is that there is more emphasis on poetic words than the music.  This is poetry highlighted with music whereas most other music is noise highlighted with words, some of which are hardly poetic. If you are looking for some music that doesn't give you a headache but can also make you happy, and have your feet bouncing then Love and Theft is a very wise purchase!  Congrats Bob on the best album by far of this year!
B00000373U|4.0|I usually shy away from linear/folksy song writing, but the sheer talent of this man transcends my tastes. He's got such a strong amount of emotion in his voice you can't help but be moved. Now it's not without the occasional cringe lyric. I mean we are talking about Elliot smith, every cardigan clad ...emo boy's dream,... but it's a small price to pay.<BR>He also has a very distinct production sound to his music. A very deliberate 4 track, hissy, analog sound that really adds to the &quot;poor artist in a ... soho slum&quot; feel.
B00005NZBN|5.0|This is an astonishing recording. Bob produced it and it shows. &quot;Time out of mind&quot;, good as it was, is no match for this amazing piece of classic Dylan. Honest, clear, deep into his own mortality, this is Dylan at his best. How can he trust others to produce his records is something I will never understand. This is, simply, the very best he has done since &quot;Blood on the tracks&quot;. Is that enough for you?
B00003CXZ4|4.0|This is a film about the dialectics of remembrance and oblivion, about the question of the existance of a real world outside of our consciousness, about the nature of time and truth in a psychological sense.<br />Given it would be possible that a man has his full capability to think, remember his complete life until a special incident (when his wife was raped and he was heavily injured trying to help her), still can think and draw highly difficult conclusions, but is unable to make any new memories thereafter. He can plan for the future, but forgets within minutes every detail that was ever happening since his injury.<br />The very last thing Leonard remembers permanently, is the pain to see his wife dying, and his permanent will for revenge.<br />People used to say, time can heal every pain. But he cannot remember anything since, he even does not know how much time passed by: &quot;How am I supposed to heal if I can't feel time?&quot; He's searching for revenge as if this would comfort and relieve him. But he cannot even remember, if his wife is really dead (he saw her dying, but maybe she recovered?), he does not know if he already got revenge ... Sure, he has his photos, but other than people with a normal memory, if he doesn't like the truth he can simply burn a photo in order to clear his conscience.<br />Trying to give the viewer a feeling of his &quot;condition&quot;, the film jumps backward in time, step by step, tells the reason later than the event, thereby fully stretching the VIEWER's attention and short-term memory. Only at the end of the movie, i.e. the beginning of the story, the viewer can know, should know, if all of Leonard's conlusions have been logical, in other words, whether or not he punished the right one (or two?).  <br />It's almost impossible to understand the complete plot after seeing this movie only once, and even after the second time you will still not be sure. This makes it really absolutely interesting. For me, the movie is based ona brilliant idea, exciting, made virtuoso, unfortunately with very low respect to reality, but still a rewarding brain-teaser and contribution to a philosophical and psychological discussion.
B000002BSG|4.0|I bought this CD just for the famous song and it's video. But when i got around to listen to the rest of the songs, i found them quite relaxing to listen to. My favorite is a song with no lyrics at all, but it uses different instruments in it. If your into pop music or you just need a break from the bubble-gum BSB and N'sync, this CD is perfect.
B00000253N|5.0|There are good albums, there are great albums, and there are masterpieces. Then there is &quot;Blood on the Tracks.&quot; I cannot think of any album that is its equal and, trust me, I've tried. Even in Dylan's amazing catalog there is not a single album that equals it. True, there are albums that have more musical sophistication and may be played a bit better - but &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; has something behind all that - it's got some serious soul. This is a painful record; a record recorded after Dylan's divorce from his wife, Sara (whom he had written many, many songs for and about). The order of the tracks is absolutely perfect. The opener, &quot;Tangled up in Blue,&quot; is one of Dylan's finest - absolutely amazing to listen to. Every other track details love, love lost, and betrayal (&quot;Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts&quot; is deliciously nasty, filled with seediness and treachery). Every track on here is spectacular - all 10 are standouts. However, something must be said about the last three tracks. &quot;If You See Her Say Hello&quot; is such a tender song - very bittersweet and a fullfledged masterpiece. It is a lament but also a song of happiness written by a lover who respects and understands what his former lover did. &quot;Shelter for the Storm&quot; is also a masterpiece - religious imagery abounds here. I can't figure out every detail of this lyric, but it is one of Dylan's best ever - absolutely amazing to listen to. &quot;Buckets of Rain&quot; - wow. Soft, sweet, yet also sad. The last line is one that sticks in your had: &quot;Life is sad; Life is a bust; All you can do is do what you must; You do what you must do and you do it well; I'd do it for you; Honey, Baby can't you tell?&quot;<BR>This is an album that belongs in everyone's collections. It is beautiful yet vicious. A piece of genius and the masterwork of the 20th Century. You could not possibly find a collection of 10 songs that is better than this one.  The cohesiveness ofthe album is also stunning.  Bob Dylan is surely a genius and &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; is, thus far, his finest moment. His past two albums, &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; and &quot;Love and Theft,&quot; are spectacular as well but if you haven't listened to much Dylan then you'd best start here.
B000059XYM|3.0|There's really not much to say about the premise of this offensive, trashy, but funny, film. If you've seen any of the \\"Scream\\" films or \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\", then the film's premise needn't be explained. What we get is one crude joke after another. The most surprising thing about it is that a lot of them are funny. Believe me, you'll laugh, but you'll also be ashamed and embarrased that you did. The script has no real direction, it just seems to be a runaway train tossing off one liners here and sight gags there. It's a rather fun ride tho. Ana Faris, as the heroine, is very appealing. I can't quite put my finger on it. \\"SNL\\" regular Cheri Oteri is another stand out. Shawn Wayans, who plays Ray, is very funny as a muscle bound jock who has a strong feminine side. It's one of the few running jokes in the film that stays funny. Regina Hall is very funny. She's a wonderful comedic actress. Marlon Wayans was annoying. You don't care one way or the other if he's on screen. Scary Movie isn't the first horror spoof, and probably won't be the last. Nothing new and nothing memorable. But, I have to say, I laughed. If this is your kind of thing, then go ahead and try it. You might like it. Skip the sequel.
B00005A46T|4.0|well to to put it blunty im not a &quot;hardcore&quot; slipknot fan. I do like the band and I do have the origanal version of there 2nd cd (yes second) which contained the songs frail limb nursery and purity. Though if you lined me up with the crazy &quot;slipknot is the best most talented band&quot; fans, I would stick out preety bad. well anyway the new cd is preety good. slipknot said that their new cd would be faster and harder and they stayed true to their word. the pace is strong and you get hit by song after song over a 66 minute period. some of the songs like &quot;the heretic anthem&quot;  even manage to be catchy (dispite some very dumb lyrics).                  <BR>   so where does the cd fault? well for one its a lot harder to sing along with corey. he yells so loud, so fast, its hard to tell what hes saying most of the time (which isnt always bad). some of the songs on the cd also manage to be really stupid. i mean whats the deal with &quot;disasterpiece&quot;. &quot;noises, noises, people make nosies, people make nosies when their sick&quot;. what the hell is that. the song starts well then it just brakes into a random drum roll and a chorus that in no way fits the song.<BR>   some people may think I dont understand slipknot. Though I think i do. The cd is quility and is worth a listen. slipknot, though not overly talented is one of the better new (non underground) speed metal bands (and yes their not death or black metal).
6302968143|4.0|This movie is criminally underrated. First of all, the film wasn't the flop people think it is. It did over 45 million at the box office. Okay, that settled, let's dig in. Three witches from the 1800's are hung for taking the souls out of children in Salem, Mass. Present day Salem, a lonely teen resurrects the three hags accidentally while visiting their old cottage that has turned into a mini museum. The witches, well cast and perfectly played by Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy, set out on Halloween night to take the souls from the children as they trick or treat. The three lead actresses are perfect in their roles. They really bring them to life. This is a fun, light hearted film that the whole family can enjoy. The setting and decoration is perfect and has that great Halloweeny feel. There's also a funny cameo by Penny Marshall and Garry Marshall as husband and wife(but who are real life brother and sister in case you didn't know). This is a real great vehicle for Bette Midler. She fits perfectly. You'll also recognize Thora Birch(American Beauty)as the little sister. The film is a wonderful family treat that will delight and entertain the whole family.
1586210912|3.0|Just finished the book and found it to be intersting and may have motivated me to search into other topics and strategies for investing. However, I felt the book was oversimplified, repetitve and mis-leading.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus rode on high expectations, and since its release, I have seen mixed reactions. I'm not sure quite why. In all honesty, I was skeptical that they could match Aenima. Or rather, live up to the hype. Thankfully, Tool didn't try to one-up themselves. I guess this is why so many people are accusing them of selling out. I think that accusation is ridiculous, and obviously the attack of someone that knows nothing of the band themselves. I guess it's the burden of the artist that such an enviable work as Aenima needs to be followed with more of exactly the same in order to please the masses. I don't think there's a dull track on Lateralus. Everything here is pure emotional exploration, without losing Tool's legendary lyrical ambition. Lateralus is also far better from a production standpoint than anything tool has done. The drums and bass especially are crisp and alive. Lateralus also has a unique sound in this day and age. Whereas most modern rock sounds the same- firmly grounded rock-style drumming laid down behind stadium vocals, a fat bassline and showoff guitars, Tool opts for uniqueness from every angle- Carey's stunning, precision drum patterns; Chancellor's thinner, effects-laden bass lines; Jones' morphing, progressive guitar tracks; and Keenan's soaring- though never showy- vocals. A lot of people don't seem to like the last tracks of the album, but I think they're some of the most emotional music on it. Slow, building, and requiring more patience, I think they're ultimately more rewarding. Not to mention that the lyrics to Reflection are beyond what praise can adequately convey.<BR>In all, I think alot of people are missing the point, but I'm glad just to see so many people searching. Keep it up. I can't recommend this album any higher. This may well be a new high in modern rock music.
6304913176|5.0|Starship Troopers is a wonderful movie though no where near as good as the book. The Book is a must read.
0440219078|4.0|As I began this story I really enjoyed it. I love stories involving utopias and this book embodies such a society perfectly. But as you round towards the end of the book in utter excitement the story takes a turn that I found disapointing. If I had stopped reading this book half way through, even three forths of the way through, I would say it was one of the best books I have ever read; but after the ending I have to say that though this book was enjoyable and highly recomendable I wish it could have ended differently.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a superb adaptation of Jane Austen's &quot;pride and Predjudice&quot; . I recommend it! Nothing like the silly adaptation of the 1930. I loved the story, the acting, the ending, everything! Buy it! It is well worth it!  I just could not stop watching it!  I was stuck to my TV until I finished it.
B000001E7V|5.0|Former Massive Attack member, Tricky, strikes gold with his debut CD, Maxinquaye.  This album has an almost surreal effect to it.  The fact that the lyrics can be undistinguishable at times adds to that effect.  Each track has its own mood to it and this is a CD that you will not get bored listening to.  All the tracks are excellent but especially, Overcome, Black Steel, Abbaon Fat Track, and Strugglin'.  If you are getting into trip-hop then you must buy this CD.  Especially recommended for those who have all 3 Massive Attack CDs and Dummy by Portishead.
6300182452|5.0|Just who is this &quot;stranger&quot;, portrayed by Clint Eastwood, who has entered Lago, and what is his purpose?  From the time he arrives, until he leaves, we are left wondering about this shadowy individual.  <br />Lago is a small Texas town where not to long ago a brutal murder of a sheriff occurred, while the whole town watched, too cowardly to come to his aid.  &quot;Help me,&quot; he utters again and again, while his attackers whip him to death.<br />Now enter the man with no name.  Is he the spirit of the dead sheriff, his brother perhaps, or maybe some kind of ghoulish devil?  Who ever he is, he quickly takes over the town, then takes charge of it, preparing for the return of the three men who killed the sheriff.  It seems his real attempt, other than to avenge the death of the sheriff, is to run the town into the ground; retribution for their earlier cowardice.  The most fitting reprisal being, perhaps, having the townspeople paint the town red, and then rename it &quot;Hell&quot;.  <br />Eastwood's character has no compassion for the people, and as much as he abuses them, we cannot somehow feel sorry the way in which they are being treated.  And even after trying to build up their defense, and train them to shoot at their targets properly and effectively, he still comes to their aid at the end - the bad man shouting out &quot;Who are you&quot;, and never given a reply.<br />Most westerns are the shoot 'em up kind, which we enjoy.  The difference between them and &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot; is that this movie hangs on our moral conscience; and we don't soon forget it.
B00003CXP1|5.0|One word described the way I felt after viewing this movie---finally.  Finally, someone had the guts to make a depressing movie, that will leave the viewer sad yet satisfied.  Finally, someone made a movie without using a lot of special effects, but still told a story with innovative and unique camera techniques (not to mention a horrific yet capturing soundtrack).  This someone mentioned is Darren Aronofsky, and I believe that he is one of the best new directors in film today.  I love both of his movies (Pi being the other, don't miss that one either), and I am looking forward to his new project with Brad Pitt.<BR>Back to the subject at hand, Requiem for a Dream is a great movie with very believable characters played magnificently by Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely, and Marlon Wayans.  The simple plot is magnified by the camera work and acting.  This movie is a must see.   Go out and watch it now....heck watch it twice.
B00005JA2B|5.0|If you want to experience a 'Kansas Moment', buy these albums now! You'll most certainly revel in familiar music, but it's like listening to a new album. Upon openning the CD(s), you could tell from one glance, that a lot of work went into these: great pics, liner notes, and extra tracks. Like I said in my Masque comments, I feel fortunate to stumble across these albums. I guess since these are remasters Sony figures it can't charge full market price, but the overall production is clearly on par with todays market.
B000002BMV|4.0|It seems that Journey is often dismissed as a lame 80's pop rock band, but they were much more than that.  They were actually closer in spirit to oldschool progressive rock, like Yes or Kansas.  There was a little of that &quot;80's sound&quot; in there, but the progressive aspect is undeniable.  Listen to Neal Schonn rip into those amazing solos, and see if you can still tell me this is simple pop rock.  &quot;Don't Stop Believin&quot; and &quot;Open Arms&quot; are great mainstream tracks, but this album has more to offer than just those.  The title track and &quot;Keep on Runnin&quot; are good, energetic hard rockers, and &quot;Who's Cryin Now&quot; has a very jazzy feel.  I don't care much for &quot;Still They Ride&quot;.  A ballad about the James Gang was kind of odd, I think it should have been a faster track.  But all in all, this is good stuff.  It's a bit mainstream, but the talent is definitely there.  These guys played very tight, and all the musicians were good at what they did.  Oh yeah, and Steve Perry is a great voacalist, much better than the newer guy.  If you like this, I would recommend albums from Queensryche, Dream Theater, and Transatlantic, so you can kind of see the &quot;evolution&quot; of progressive rock.  This album's not really essential, but I'd say it's probably Journey's best, and an enjoyable listen for any prog. rock fan.
B000002JPA|5.0|Okay, I'll admit it.  The first time I listened to this album, I thought it was crap.  &quot;What is the appeal of this band, dammit?&quot; I thought.  &quot;WHY are so many people amazed by this band?&quot;  Sure, Pull Me Under and Metropolis caught my attention, but I just envisioned the band as just another 80s hair band that had forgotten to die before they got into the 90s (I never knew that they were a fairly new band at the time, dammit!).<br /><BR>Then, it happened.  I got Metropolis pt 2:  Scenes from a memory, which, for lack of more strong phrases, blew me away.  I was amazed by this album.<br /><BR>A couple of months passed.  Then, I decided to have another wee listen.  I noticed so much more than I had before!  Pull Me Under, Metropolis and the last two tracks (Wait For Sleep and Learning to Live) are still my favourites, but the songs I never really saw the appeal of during my first listen, such as Another Day (the one I thought the least of, because it reminded me heavily of Bon Jovi, who I detest with prejudice of the most extreme existance) and Under a Glass Moon (what a GREAT song!) really jumped out at me!!!<br /><BR>But I think the single greatest song on this album is, without the shadow of a doubt, Learning to Live!  I don't know if it's the case in all of DT's albums (the only ones I've heard are Awake, Images and Words, and SFAM), but from the ones I've heard, the last tracks have been, literally haunting!!!  After listening to that song, I could not get the final part out of my head!  &quot;Why does it have to fade out so damned soon!&quot; I kept on saying!  In my opinion, that song should be 15 minutes longer, and the extra 15 minutes should consist of only the ending!  THEN it should fade out, dammit!
B000002UEB|5.0|Hmm, what can I even say about this album that would be at all helpful?  You already know it's a great album, with a brilliant storyline, and amazing vocals.  The best album ever made.  Hmm, well, not quite the best ever made, but probably up there.  I do agree that the story is great, and the sound clips help to understand it (reminds me a lot of Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot;), but I'm afraid that where it excells lyrically, it lacks musically.  I did find myself enjoying this, but I wouldn't say that it blew me away.  The songs are good, but &quot;Eyes of a Stranger&quot; is the only one that came close to blowing me away.  The solos are great, and the melodies flow quite well, but it's just...well, it's good stuff, but there's something missing.  It needs more heavy riffs (after all, this is metal), and some more complex instrumental interludes (after all, this is progressive).  If you want to hear Queensryche at their best, I would recommend &quot;Empire&quot;.  This album is at most second to that one, but you need to get it if you like Queensryche, or just this kind of music.  It's not quite as good as &quot;The Wall&quot;, and it doesn't come close to Dream Theater, but it's a great album nonetheless.

He traces the advents of different ways of constructing the world order - from Machiavellian &quot;Raison d'erte&quot; policy of the First Minister of France Cardinal Richelieu, to the first concept of the &quot;balance of power&quot; advocated by Metternich at the Congress of Vienna, through breakup of that balance by Crimean War and Bismarck, from British policy of &quot;Splendid Isolation&quot; to British policy of limited alliances just before the WW1, from the mistakes of Treaty of Versailles, to the Marshall plan, from Kennedy policy of containment during the Berlin and Cuban crises, to Nixon's (and Kissinger) conduct of the Cold War. <BR> <BR>This is a brilliant exposition of the academician and the practitioner of the art of diplomacy.

0380973650|3.0|This book surprised, shocked, disgusted, intrigued, but ultimately disappointed me. The books main premise of a fight between the transported 'Old World' gods and the new ones of modern urban America is a good one, each fighting for the thing that makes the gods immortal - belief in and homage to them. This war is slowly brought to light as Shadow, the main character,  learns piece by piece about them, through direct interaction and through multiple dream sequences. Shadow's growing acceptance of the weird, different, and (normally) impossible is well handled, carrying the reader along a path from everyday reality to a final acceptance of a truly fantastic world, where our world is in some ways just a shadow of the true reality.<br />Gaimam is at his best in the dream sequences and the short historical interludes that give a proper background to the arrival in America of many of the 'Old World' gods that are interspersed throughout the book. Within these, there is a distinct dark flavor, almost an oppressive depressiveness,  an evocation of the not quite seen. Some of the descriptions of the odd-byway distinctive American tourist attractions are interesting and striking.<br />Where this book fails, however, is in three distinct areas:<br />The first problem is the sheer variety and number of the referenced gods. Most authors working in this area have confined themselves to using gods from only one distinct pantheon (Norse, Greek, Egyptian, Indian, etc). Here, Gaiman has referenced gods from almost every corner of the world. Few readers will have the background necessary to recognize all of these (especially not from the minimal clues Gaiman gives to their identities), and therefore will not be able to add each god's distinctive qualities to the portrayed character, thus making these characters near ciphers.<br />The second problem is very limited character development for anyone other than Shadow and Wednesday (Odin). Even Laura (Shadow's dead wife) and Mr. World (Loki), major players in the final resolution, are given very minimal development, leading to little emotional involvement by the reader in the outcome.<br />The third problem is Gaiman does not give any real 'presence' to any of the 'new' gods; there is no feeling either for or against them, as they nebulous names only ('media', 'credit', 'auto').<br />There are some scenes of rather shocking sex and a rather cavalier, everyday tone to his relating of some very horrific events. These add a lot to the very dark tone that prevails throughout this book, but 'atmosphere' alone cannot carry the full weight. At the end, I was left with a feeling of 'OK, so what?'  An ambitious, interesting concept for a novel, but not totally successful in its execution.(Loki), major players in the final resolution, are given very minimal development, leading to little emotional involvement by the reader in the outcome.<br />The third problem is Gaiman does not give any real 'presence' to any of the 'new' gods; there is no feeling either for or against them, as they nebulous names only ('media', 'credit', 'auto'). <br />There are some scenes of rather shocking sex and a rather cavalier, everyday tone to his relating of some very horrific events.

0767802519|5.0|In one of Natalie Portman's earliest performances, and undoubtedly one of Jean Reno's best, The Professional is the story of a Hitman who grows a heart, when he sees that his neighbor, a young girl, is being abused at home.  Shortly after that, a corrupt DEA raid leaves the girl's family dead, at which point Reno's character takes her in.<br />The movie is quite good...the concept of a Hitman with a heart is not one seen too often.  Gary Oldman also delivers a fine performance as the corrupt DEA officer who murders Mathilde's(Portman's) family.  Jean Reno, however, stands out the most in this film.  What could probably be considered his breakthrough American performance, or at least on of his best to date, his role could not be filled by anyone better.  <br />The European extended version, called 'Leon: The Professional', not only delivers the same great movie, but it also adds an extra half hour to the movie over-all, extending the character development of Leon(Reno) and his origins in the circle of organized crime, the relationship of Mathilde and Leon, and just completely enhancing the movie overall.  <br />Exciting gunplay and excellent character development make this movie well worth the price of admission.  Undoubtedly Reno's best performance yet, supported by a strong performance by Gary Oldman and a rather well done performance by Natalie Portman.
0446607274|4.0|When a black attorney who has built a high profile practice sueing the LAPD on civil rights violations is found killed on the downtown funicular know as &quot;Angel's Flight&quot;, Bosch, Edgar and Ridder are called in.  In a city haunted by both the Rodney King riots and the OJ trial, the investigation proceeds on pins and needles. As Harry digs, he comes to suspect that the truth may lie in the case Elias was working on - the civil case stemming from the murder of an eleven year white girl from a powerful family.  It all gets nicely complicated.  Harry's also trying to quit smoking (finally!) and his marriage to Eleanor is on the rocks.<br />On the whole, I enjoyed this Bosch.  It was nice to have a book that didn't spend huge amounts of time in Las Vegas.  This book has plenty of juicy twists and turns without treading in the realm of obscurity.  It's still not as good as some of the early Bosch stories but well worth the time it took to read.
B00005K3O4|5.0|Killer Klowns is without a doubt one of the best American films ever made. Hands down. <br />The sheer cleverness that went into making this film, paying tribute to so many other B movies, is simply magnificent. <br />The plot starts like so many other movies of its kind; teenagers (played by actors/actresses in their late twenties) making out at a spot called &quot;The Top of the World,&quot; witnessing what they think is a meteor and quickly going to &quot;investigate.&quot;<br />What they discover is a tent in the middle of the woods. What the audience discovers is a pure gem of a movie. Every possible circus reference is used in this movie, all the way down to the Klown Kar. <br />This movie is a mark of brilliance. Part of me wants a sequel, part of me wants this to stand on its own forever.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|If you're still skeptical after reading all these glowing reviews, you shouldnt be- this album is nothing short of astonishing.  Like most great albums, it draws you in like quicksand with each successive listen.  <br />Production-wise, the music doesnt sound like its been handled too much from the time it leaves the instruments to the time it reaches your speakers. There's no fancy mixing, no slick production, just a roomful of soulful instrumentalists backing up Dylan's time-weathered vocals.  <br />There's certainly something for every lover of American music here: furrowed fields flooded with blues, characters soaked full of rain and moonshine, and the kinds of songs that spring from an age when radio was still a novelty, songs that you could imagine people playing together on the front porch.  <br />It's also strange to think that all these anachronisms should pour out now onto such a changed American landscape. Yet that's what gives them their power- not only to contrast where we've come but also to underscore the truths and pitfalls that are still common to our experience, then or now.  And as always, Dylan sings out these snippets of myths like he's wringing out a flag filled with a million untold stories, the cast as motley and unforgettable as ever.  <br />Be sure to check out the luckless charm of Po' Boy, or the old wound that has been reopened in Sugar Baby.  It's all here- a walk through a damp field that leads to the source, setting off the crickets as you go.
0679879269|5.0|This sequel of the subtle knife was exellent!But I liked the previous one better.Lyra is kidnaped and Will sets of to search her.The final battle with the authorithy and the abbys in the world of the dead are all great.I thought the end was kinda sad.<BR>Great!I know you wil like it.<BR>Just sit back and enjoy...
B00003CXAA|5.0|The title says it all. The Godfather trilogy is simply the best; 'nuff said.
B00004YW6I|4.0|An uncanny and haunting album in light of the recent events in new york.
6302824729|5.0|Sequels usually don't live up to the legacy the first ones leave, but I have to say that Karate Kid Part II is better than the first.  Karate is no longer about winning points in a tournament, but about defending your honor and way of life.  The final scene is about life and death, not to see who gets 3 points first.  See where Mr. Miyagi was born into the life of karate and learn about his ancestors.  Find out the reason why Mr. Miyagi left his beloved homeland and first love.  It's a wonderful story that has action, drama and comedy all in one.  I definitely give this movie 5 bright stars!!!!!
B00005ATQM|4.0|This DVD was a total suprise...a bunch of head banging metal heads that created a fantastic DVD...who would have thought?  This DVD has excellent channel separation, good crisp highs, excellent subwoofer lows, the voices were usually centered and properly mixed, and the rear surround channels had lots of action.  I dont care for Metallica's music but was blown away by the quality of this recording.  If your a Metallica fan I recommend this with 5 stars.  If you dont like their music, I still recommend this with 4 stars.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I love this movie...especially the character Chunk!  The DVD has deleted scenes and commentary that are good extras, but not necessary.  After watching some of the deleted scenes, you don't really have to wonder why they weren't included in the movie, but they're still fun to watch!
0517118297|5.0|The way she writes is just phenominal, I would give anything to write the way she does. And how well she relates the facts of her time peroid into her Novels is just fantastic! I loved it and will love it for a long time to come!
0792844890|4.0|I think this movie is so funny...I was a little disappointed with the special features...not much going on there: theatrical trailer, commentary, behind the scenes footage; no cool game or deleted scenes.  It doesn't matter, though...you buy the DVD for the movie, not the features.
0789723107|5.0|A very straight-forward book on web usability.  Anyone designing web sites will find thought provoking ideas that will help improve their sites.  Krug's writing style is relaxed and he doesn't take himself too seriously which is a refreshing change in this crowded subject area.
0792838084|5.0|I wonder how David Lynch's mother felt when she saw this story pour out of her darling son's mind.  If she's anything like David himself, I'm sure she was extremely proud.  Lynch made one of the best films of the 1980s when he completed Blue Velvet.  This is one of those movies that is so powerful and visually stunning that you can't help but involve yourself with it's sick and strangely motivated characters.  When watching this you will cringe, you will grind your teeth, and you will find yourself with a disturbed look on your face...and Lynch wouldn't want it any other way.<br />    This film is a fusion of neo-noir style, art-house poetry, heart-stopping suspense, and sadistic erotica.  It's not for all tastes, but should be viewed by anyone who's willing to give up two hours and think for a little while.  What does Lynch have to say about society today?  Not much that is positive, let me tell you.  But he doesn't shove it in your face, he lets the viewer determine how he feels through examining the actions of the characters caught in the web of criminal activity and violent sexuality that the film offers.  You may not be smiling after watching this movie, but I do promise you two things: 1) You will NEVER forget the movie  2) You will have nightmares in which Dennis Hopper stars as an antagonist.  His role is so startling and demanding that you may find yourself staring at him in awe.  To prepare yourself for Blue Velvet, try viewing the gentler Lynch opus The Elephant Man, or the original cult classic, Eraserhead.  Small town America was never so terrifying...
B00005B4GU|5.0|Somehow, this has become my favourite album. I bought it on impulse because I liked other Radiohead singles, in fact, I'm one of those rare people that doesn't have firmly developed opinions on the supposed evolution of Radiohead. Which, I think, might be the best way to approach this album. It is subdued, but energetic at times [&quot;Packd Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box&quot; for instance]. &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; is beautiful in its piano simplicity; &quot;Life in a Glass House&quot; is distant and aged, due to the blues-like saxaphone. I listen to this album before I sleep, on the bus, anytime, it doesn't seem to matter...I just can't get enough.
6302424739|5.0|I am an adventure movie fan. I love clashing swords and galloping horses. A dragon to be slain or a world to be saved just plain thrill me. My heroes have always been cowboys and knights and people who spit in the face of danger. So why am I writing a review of a movie like this? Well, don't tell any of my neighbors, but I's b sucker for a great &quot;people movie&quot; and this is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Anthony Hopkins isn't Hannibal and Ms bancroft isn't Mrs Robinson in this, and they , and everyone else in it, are GREAT!
B00005NZBN|5.0|This is Bob at his best - touching, funny, lyrical, and self-deprecating.  There is not a bad track here.  The &quot;bonus&quot; tracks make for an interesting contrast between  young Bob Dylan in the 1961 and old Bob here in 2001.  Thank you Mr. Dylan for a great, great album.
B00005K9LN|5.0|So, at least they re-released the remastered version of JUDAS classic albuns. BRITISH STEEL was the turning point on their career, when they accepted to go a little bit more mainstream without losing their self respect. They changed producer, added Dave Holland on drums and began a new phase. The ersult: this classic here.
B000059WOD|5.0|I haven't heard of Linkin Park up until the time I heard Crawling. I still felt a bit skeptical about buying their CD so I downloaded a few MP3s. Finally I said to myself...'that's it, I'm going to go by the CD.' Well, that was around the middle of the summer and ever since, I haven't stopped listening to this CD; like many others who have contributed their o' so true thoughts on what is certainly the best CD you can possibly find. Now, I swear by Linkin Park!! I can't get enough of this CD, I love it!!! It is in my discman 24/7 as it is with everybody else. Linkin Park certainly is the most talented band in the music industry, right up there with P.O.D!
B00002MZ2T|5.0|After hearing quite a bit of awesome music in my life, in my opinion, Savage Garden far surpasses any of them! The awesome duo of Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones packs so many punches. And all in one album! Affirmation is an awesome song, with one of the albums two trips in the line &quot;I believe you can't control or choose your sexuality&quot;. Other then that, it's a beautiful song, and the good *WAY* over powers that one &quot;bad&quot; line. Hold Me is an okay song. It's my least favorite and I usually program my radio to skip it. There's nothing in the song that's bad, I just don't care for the style. I Knew I Loved You is the most awesome song ever! It's so sweet. And so very, very true. The Best Thing is another great song. About being so in love with someone that they've become your better half. Then onto Crash and Burn. This is a very, very close second in my favorite list, right under I Knew I Loved You. This song is about those times when you feel like breaking and someone let's you break on them. It affirms that everything will be fine in the end. Chained To You is amazing. It sounds like an 80's pop song, but different. Kind of the same theme as The Best Thing, but in a different way. The Animal Song is so creative! The guys definitely were in a good mood while writing this one. Instead of crumbling under the stress of this world, Daz sings about not thinking about it and exscaping it. The Lover After Me is kind of sad. It's about a relationship that was carried on and then the broke up, but after 7 months he still isn't ready to let go. Two Beds and a Coffee Machine is nothing like it's title. It's actually a song about an abused wife. But she has to continue to go home so she can feed her family. Free To Fly is a truly inspiring song. Though I do not like the chorus very much {it slows the song down too much} the lyrics to the rest of the song will leave you with a great feeling. Gunning Down Romance isn't as repulsive as it might sound. There are times when each of us just becomes engraged at the love around us. That's what this song is. And last, but certainly not least, I Don't Know You. This is probably my third favorite on the album. The piano in the background is truly breathtaking. Overall, this album deserves way more then 5 stars. I listen to it every day and I'm still not sick of it!
1881273156|5.0|This is a SUPERB book for those wanting to renew their love, find out how to love better, or just read a well-written, lovely book! It's amazing that love has languages too, but they are as different as anything, and Chapman really details them out for ya. You might be getting a marriage-survival guide in this book! It also helps people to understand how other people express love in non-verbal ways and how you might need to express love in non-verbal ways. Lots of great examples, this is a MUST HAVE book for all lovers -- and we are all lovers, aren't we?
B000002H70|5.0|I can still remember the first time I heard this album. The day it hit the shelves, I borrowed the disk from a friend and sampled it while on break. Like no other album before or since, the brilliance of this work immediately overwhelmed me. I listened to the first 30-45 seconds of each song, track by track, through the whole disk. I kept waiting for weak songs to skip over, but they never came...<BR>I bought a copy for myself immediately after work and listened to it in it's entirety, twice, that very night.<BR>To this day, so many years later, Disintegration remains one of my favorite albums. It is pure, raw, distilled emotion set in an environment that encompasses such a depth and breadth of feeling that you could lose yourself there. For a time.<BR>For me, this is the Cure's Magnum Opus. If you don't own it, get it.<BR>If you have it, go listen to it again.<BR>If you listened to it and don't like it, try again. You didn't hear it first time around.
B00003CXWU|5.0|Wow!  Not that I am surprised that this is a great movie, I mean it has Johnny Depp (a very unrated actor in my opinion).  This movie is not only about drugs, money, and sex......it is about soul and emotion, trying to love and take care of your friends and family.....even if it is considered to be corrupt.  I am not saying that George Jung was a hero......he just hated poverty more than he hated sin.....and this movie does portray him as likeable....Johnny Depp does a wonderful job, in transceding what the character is feeling......and who is to judge that this is all so terribly wrong.....I bet if one, dug into what the US government and CIA has done and still does.......it would not be that much different than a drug cartel.
0899663036|5.0|This book is my favorite. I red this book in Turkish my native language. I loved the charecters.Francie who is a combination of Katie and Johnny and herpassion for life and the love of reading,her brother Nelly that is favored by Katie,the character I love most is Johnny he has an increadible imagination ,one of the best father charecters I ever red I didn't think he was a badperson because despite his drinking problem he was a good dad.Katie is the mother and she is so strong while reading the book I always taught she would survive anything.The story is how this family survives death, poverty and love between them and Brooklyn
3931372898|5.0|I love this book. It's a classic. It's about a boy from another planet and a pilot.The Adventures the boy had is amazing and the book has a wonderfull philosophy inside the pilot gets valuable life lessons fromthat amazing kid such as being an adult, notto kill the inside child and what is most valuable are not seen with eyes, with heart.The part that prince said goodbye to wollf is amazing,real touching.After reading that book I look at the stars to see the amazing little prince. I recomend this book to everybody espacially adults and I think adults enjoy this book more.
B000000LZV|5.0|If you have any interest in where West Coast post-punk came from, the answer lies somewhere between here and Meat Puppets II. The crowning achievement and perfect introduction to one of the most acclaimed and yet still under-appreciated bands of the rock era.
B00003CX5P|1.0|You have failed your highness. Lucas is the true Phantom Menace.
B00005NW02|3.0|I was anxiously awaitng this release due to the single Chop Suey! which was full of energy and original.  If the execs were trying to hook people by releasing this single first, it worked on me.<br />I am certainly not one to shy away from raw vocals, hard music, and pulling lyrics, but this was a bit too much.  Every song has that throaty yell that has become a trademark in hard core rock.  And to discover that the lead reveres Charles Manson??  That, I must say was a turn off.<br />This is certainly not a horrible CD.  But it is not the best I won.  I still love Chop Suey! but can't say that about any of the others songs on this CD.
630438551X|5.0|This electrifying adaptation is an amazing tribute to how effectively the world of today can by synthesized with the words written by Shakespeare in the 1500's<br />Once again we are reminded of how what Shakespeare wrote then is a relevant today as ever<br />I'm not a fan of Leonardo de Caprio but must say that in the role of Romeo he excelled himself, while the beautiful Claire Danes was charming and unforgettable in her role as Juliet<br />The production begins with the narrators represented as a newsreader on a TV screen and from there we are taken to the town of Verona Beach where we observe gang warfare, deals made in corporate high-rise buildings and the lavish parties in 1990's style<br />I was electrified throughout the performance and amazed at the genius of the adaptation<br />Kudos must also go to the actors who so brilliantly portrayed the villainous and slick gangland leader Tybalt and the drag artist Mercutio
0064407667|5.0|This book is number 2 after Harry Potter It rulz. If you want a book full of sadness but also full of dark humour this is the book for you. It's easy to read so you can finish it easily it took me one day to finish it but I couldn't put it down!
B000021YQV|5.0|this is the best album of 2001...amazing album a true classic
0821221841|4.0|Good overview of how a camera and lens systems works.  The book discusses all formats of cameras and various lenses and filters in good detail.  Very good explainations of exposure depth of field focus and all other general topics are discussed.  This is a great reference for anyone who wants to know the workings of a camera. The book also convers what each format of camera can do.  It outlines techniques for achieving effects based on focal length, apeture and film speed.  There is also a section of filters and what you can do for you.  The book has a heavy bias towards black and white but most techniques are transferable to color.  There is not alot about exposure control that is in the next book the The Negative.  This book will help with camera care maintaince and help you decide what kind of equipmnet you will need as you advance as a photographer.  The descriptions are never brand names but types of cameras and lenes.  This book is very fundimental and therefore timeless.
B000001E18|2.0|After a succesful change in direction and sound with Achtung Baby, U2 decided to try it again with Zooropa. What a mess. The former stellar guitar work disappears into the mix, the songwriting is dull, and then we come to the vocals. Bono seems to feel this sludge is inventive and original, but all the listener gets is a little boy playing with his new tape machine. I hope drugs were involved, at least then he'd have an excuse. For a singer with a voice that could cause goosebumps in the past, this exercise was a waste of talent and other people's money.<BR>It has become popular in some circles now to say this album is an inventive work whose merits are only recognized by the truly insightful. Don't believe it.
630420065X|5.0|This movie stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt who's Covert Team have all been assassinated..And everyone thinks he's done it..So he's on the run and trying to find the real killer..This movie has great special effects and gadgets that u would only dream of..
B00005NGZX|5.0|this album harks back at their album &quot;when forever comes crashing&quot;, in that it is much bleaker, heavier, dirtier, darker and goddamn terrifying than &quot;petitioning the empty sky&quot;, which was the first converge album i heard.<BR>Jane Doe is a masterpiece. the guitarwork is amazing, the drumming spectacular and jacob's voice is just sheer horrifying. his heavily distorted shrieks are unnerving and awesome.<br />the best tracks, for me, are Concubine, Distance And Meaning, Heaven In Her Arms, the amazing duo of Phoenix In Flight and Phoenix In Flames, and Jane Doe (11 minutes of unsettling insanity).<br />if you're a fan of converge you won't be disappointed. if you're not yet innitiated... just wait until you hear this.
0767903862|5.0|I just finished reading &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; a couple of days ago, and I am mailing right it off to a friend of mine to read.  My first encounter with Bill Bryson was through &quot;Made In America&quot; (also highly recommended) his everyman's guide to the history of the English language in America.  I found Bryson to be intelligent, funny, and down-right readable.  I followed up with &quot;Mother Tongue&quot; which wasn't as funny as &quot;Made in America&quot; but equally as informative and a pleasure to read.<br />I then picked up &quot;A Walk in the Woods.&quot;  I just couldn't get &quot;into&quot; this book.  Bryson's style was different from the other books I'd read, and I found it not quite as compelling.  A couple of months ago I picked up this book and started reading it.  It is similar in tone and style to &quot;A Walk in the Woods,&quot; but this time, I found myself intrigued.  Maybe it's the subject matter, or maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this type of book when I tried to read &quot;A Walk in the Woods.&quot;<br />Regardless, I highly recommend &quot;In a Sunburned Country.&quot;  If you like to travel, or just armchair travel, if you find new cultures and countries fascinating, if you like to learn little-known and quirky facts about people and places, I'm sure you will enjoy this book, no worries.
068484267X|5.0|This book kept me up all night. I could not let this book go. It made me realize that other parts of the world have similar problems to the ones we see in our part of the world. This book hit home right on the dot. His carefully picked words, his details, his politeness, his innocence, his ambition, all made me want more. I can't wait to read the second part of his memoir. This is an excellent story teller. And, I hope that his writing days are just beginning.<BR>     Tis'
0380973642|5.0|This was a wonderful anthology of Neil Gaiman's work.  I've been incredibly impressed with his comics and his novels, and this didn't let me down.  Dark, humourous and disturbing... scared the crap out of me, in a good way.  I recommend it highly, but not alone when it's dark outside.
0783240287|2.0|Having seen the play, and loving the colorful, musical presentation of Joseph's story, I was disappointed to see the movie cheapening the theatre experience.  The &quot;narrator&quot; is a modern woman who doesn't blend into the story at all, but is present in almost everything.  The audience of children are included in the movie which also detracts from the play itself.  The performers are talented and accomplished, but the above distractions ruined the experience for me.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|&quot;Memory is Treachery&quot; states one of Leonard's crudely etched tattoo's. &quot;Memory can change the shape of a room&quot; Leonard himself states at one point in the film.<BR>This is the heart of 'Memento'. It is not just a clever plot, or ingenious concept, it is a look at self-identity and what drives us in our day to day lives. Christopher Nolan takes a classic Film Noir concept, revenge, and twists it on it's end, making it less about a manhunt, and more about the search for an identity.<BR>It's been taken away from Leonard, and he struggles for it, grasps in the proverbial dark for it, looks to strangers for it. When all that you know fades, who do you trust, where do you begin to look.<BR>This is what 'Memento' is trying to say, and while it will baffle you with double crosses and hoodwink you with red herrings, it will also create conversations, and questions.
B000003TAW|5.0|If you are reading this review, you probably already heard one of the songs on this cd and there's not much more I can say about it.  The songs on this cd are unbelievably catchy.  I don't know anyone who doesn't like this cd.  Give this cd a try, if you don't own it.  Chances are you will like it and soon you'll be humming &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; and &quot;Say it ain't so.&quot;
B000002UAU|5.0|I don't want to say that much, because I'll just be repeating what other people have already said.<BR>No album changed rock and roll more or was better than the legendary Sgt. Pepper. It is an amazingly fluid and melodic, flowing into one album that creates a colorful, psychadelic world of its own. (Unfortunately they tried to make a movie out of it, but it failed miserably) It is diverse, yet united, which is why it is better than the legendary White Album. All the while the melodies and lyrics are perfect and unprecedented. In conclusion it is a playful, carefree, psychadelic, album that has never been topped. Greatest album EVER! Do not waste another minute without this in your musical collection. Get It Now!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I've always been a fan of Bob Dylan - from his classic days to his more recent work - but I was blown out of the water by Time Out of Mind, surprised that he still had such powerful music in him. This, of course, raised my expectations significantly for Love and Theft - and I have not been disappointed.<br />On this CD, Dylan's lyrics remain as compelling as always, and he delivers a nicely varied compilation of songs that are, of course, totally Dylan. It took me quite some time to place 'Mississippi,' even though I knew I'd heard the words before - I barely recognized it from Sheryl Crow's Globe Sessions because it's such a quintessentially Dylan song. <br />By the time Summer Days - the third song - comes on, it's clear that Dylan's taking full advantage of his musical range - and he continues to explore different sounds throughout. Some pieces seem to harken back to the early days of '50s rock, while others have just a tinge of the big band era - I had to check the liner notes to make sure that I wasn't crazy, that was an organ I heard... <br />Dylan accomplishes a feat only a few of the greats can - he manages to expand and explore new areas while still retaining his unique style and tone. This CD is perfect for both diehard Dylan fans and neophytes who only know him through his innumerable classics. Love and Theft definitely builds on Time Out of Mind and shows that Dylan still has a great deal of creativity and new music in him. Bravo. Can't wait for the next one...
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Like most of us, I first noticed Guy Pearce in L.A. Confidential.  Of course, his performance in that film was no less than flawless, but his turn in MEMENTO tops it.  Pearce brings an innocent and genuine naivity to his character Leonard Shelby.  Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantaliono are also great in this amazing movie.  Chris Nolan wonderfully combines intensity with mystery, suspense, humor, and great plot twists to an already interesting film.  MEMENTO basically works backwards.  That is, the opening scene is supposed to be the very last one and vise versa.  The way that Nolan shoots the film (each vignette is about 15 minutes that precedes another) is great.  MEMENTO makes you think and is very entertaining.  I highly recommend this film.  DO NOT BLINK, COUGH, SNEEZE, OR GLANCE AWAY, because you are sure to miss a minute and vital piece of this mind-boggling, perplexing puzzle.
B00000J7SS|5.0|First of all to like this you must be open minded,I felt this from day one but for some your taste must be abnormal or you must be a fan of Sun ra, hendrix, Sly Stone, and p-funk to catch on, cause Miles was listening to a lot of Jb, sly, and jimi at the time but these songs kicks ... man big time. Miles combined afro caribbean vibes and made a funk opus, cause this is funk maybe Miles was behind the times but he caught up and took jazz to a new direction very few can comprehend, yes this is hard to understand for some if you are not open minded but one listen i caught on,just picture jazz from a egyptian-cuban vibe i can expain this all day but still this ia a classic. R.I.P. MILES dAVIS.
B00003CXWV|5.0|BLOW is one of those fantastic movies that comes along every once in a long while.  BLOW &quot;blew&quot; me away when I saw it in theaters months ago.  Ted Demme directs the movie fantastically and the performances are top-notch.  Everyone is used to seeing Penelope Cruz in romance movies (i.e. All the Pretty Horses and Captain Corelli's Mandolin), but BLOW allows Cruz to really shine.  Even though at times, the audience is sure to dispise her character, that's how one knows a good performance when they've seen one.  In my opinion, Johnny Depp gives one of the best performances of his career in this movie.  Ray Liotta is also good as Depp's open-minded and extremely forgiving father.  Paul Reubens is hilarious and also turns in a note-worthy performance.  Blow is a great movie, the DVD has fantastic extras, and if you like music.....check out the soundtrack to BLOW.  It rocks!!
B00004XQP4|2.0|This CD isn't nearly as creative as Dookie, Insomniac, or Nimrod. Instead, for this record, they put half of the songs as &quot;Time of Your Life&quot; part 2's, or songs that are just pathetic (will somebody explain &quot;Misery&quot;?). If your gonna get any Green Day record, get any record except for this one. This was such a waste. Even though it's more like 2.5 stars, and it's not terrible, this is Green Day, and they can do 100 times better than this.<br />Favorite songs: Blood Sex and Booze, Fashion Victim, Castaway, Waiting, Minority

B000002N2P|5.0|After making the classic Dookie, Green Day decided to go a little heavier and make more of an angry punk record. And boy, did they do a good job or what? Out of all the Green Day records, this is the angriest, loudest, punkiest, and heaviest of them all. And maybe, just maybe, the best of them all.<br />Favorite songs: Armatage Shanks, Stuck With Me, Geek Stink Breath, No Pride, Panic Song, Stuart and the Ave, Brainstew, Jaded, Walking Contradiction
6300214559|5.0|Okay, okay. This was an awesome movie. I cried and cried afterwards. It stinks that I can't find enough info on if Jane and Guildford actually loved each other. Really, I did love this movie, I wasn't joking.
B000002MP2|5.0|This CD has to be THE punk-pop CD in the history of punk-pop. It's got everything, from punk riffs to extremely catchy melodies. Back in 1994, this was somewhat a revolution. Today, it stands out as THE classic punk-pop record. If you don't have this CD yet, go out to your local record store and buy it today!<br />Favorite songs: There isn't a weak track on this record, so all of them are my favorite songs!
B00005N9CV|5.0|Diana Krall has done it again. The best record of the year.<BR>Every song is excellent and will reunite her with Grammy's.
0871137380|5.0|An amazing story about the US military action in Somalia. My brother gave it to me and I bought it for two friends, one who, in turn, bought it for a mutual friend who is the commander of a tank unit. My brother's review, &quot;I couldn't put it down, I couldn't put it down, I couldn't put it down.&quot; You won't be able to either. After I read this book, I went out and bought an upgraded trauma plate for my flak vest.
B00005LQ04|5.0|It's a rarity to see movies like this one these days. Argento is a serious visonary with the horror genre.The feeling you get from watching this is so intense and disturbing that you will never look at horror the same way ever again.Masterful photograpy and story line and not to mention Goblins very uncomfortable and eerie music score gives the viewer an unforgetable roller coaster ride into terror.Please do yourself a real favor and purchase this DVD!!!
B00004TH6O|4.0|This band loves rock and roll.  They will open you up and let themselves inside.  I can prove it.<br />Infectious, unafraid to employ any conceivable sound, unwillingly in defiance of any musical construct, Queens of the Stone Age is a constantly evolving group of mutually respectful musicians who at the core are two of the most humble souls rock and roll has ever known.<br />That being said, listen straight through to &quot;R&quot;.  The lattice of Kyuss remains, as the origins of any great band should, and, now a few years growns, I still listen.
B00005N9CV|2.0|Ms. Krall's latest album consists of stylish renditions of standard tunes, consisting of &quot;mood music&quot; appropriate for rainy days and background music. Unfortunately, for those who remember her earlier albums or may have heard her perform, there is very little if any of her substantial jazz piano playing ability on display. Given the abundance of elevator music and/or &quot;smooth jazz&quot; offerings, it is regrettable that Ms. Krall does not have the courage, conviction, or perhaps opportunity to simply record a straight ahead, hard bop trio album (or a quartet with someone of note -- Joe Lovano?). Most likely, given the success of her last two albums, she has the means to choose her own artistic projects. Her tasty, well-constructed improvisations were such a welcome addition to the new jazz talent that made its brief debut in the early and mid 90s. Now they have taken an excellent piano player who is easy on the eyes and made her a fixture of yuppie love affairs.
B00005NWM3|4.0|The cut &quot;Never Again&quot; is arguably the most driving and powerful of the 10 tracks, but one of the better tracks that no one seems to be mentioning is &quot;Just For.&quot; Continuing the theme of protection of wounded women that the first track &quot;Never Again&quot; advances, &quot;Just For&quot; is quieter but with a burning anger that sticks in one's mind. Consider these lyrics:<br /><br />&quot;I want to take his eyes out, just for looking at you...yes I do.<br />And I want to take his hands off, just for touching you...yes I do.<br />And I want to rip his heart out, just for hurting you and I want to break his back now....yes I do.&quot;<br />All told, Nickelback has scored again with an even stronger album than their excellent release of last year, The State. Do yourself a favor, buy it.
B00005NP04|5.0|For the past ten years, Martina McBride's breathtaking soprano has been an enjoyable fixture in country music.    This eighteen-track Greatest Hits offers her most successful recordings.<br />As this set shows, hits collections are not always the most satisfying representation of an artist's work.  McBride's early hits (1992 through 1995) were all romps like \\"My Baby Loves Me,\\" \\"Life #9,\\" and \\"Wild Angels.\\"  Subsequently, the first third of this chronologically arranged disc is predominantly uptempo, with only the poignant ballad (and non-single) \\"Strangers\\" interrupting the frenetic pace (\\"Still Holdin' On\\" - her sorely missed duet with Clint Black - would have helped the balance).<br />The disc starts to blossom with McBride's best work from 1997's Evolution (her strongest release to date) and 1999's Emotion.  The gospelish \\"A Broken Wing\\" and the anguish-filled \\"Whatever You Say\\" showcase McBride's impressive vocal range while \\"Valentine\\" and \\"Wrong Again\\" reveal her mastery of intimate material.  \\"Love's The Only House\\" finds McBride revisiting social issues (first tackled on \\"Independence Day\\") whereas \\"Happy Girl\\" and \\"I Love You\\" capture her perky pop side.<br />Greatest Hits concludes with four new tracks.  Among them, the power-ballad \\"Where Would You Be\\" takes McBride to new depths of vulnerability, countered by the feisty \\"When God-Fearin' Women Get The Blues.\\"  All four make it clear that the Martina McBride musical story is far from over
B000056V73|3.0|A lite weight &quot;coming-of-age&quot; tale; 70's rock as seen through Kate Hudson's rose-tainted shades. There were a few good bits and performers, but overall, the characters were romaticized: the earnest striver, the bad-girl-with-a-heart-of-gold, the tarnished knight who comes through in the end. The camera work is TV-average. As for the soundtrack--how can a film be about the liberating power of rock and make an Elton ballad its centerpiece? For rock in all its jaded glory?--try Scorseses the Last Waltz.
B00005NI5Y|1.0|Correctly titled because we all LOVE the guy. He will forever be remembered as the greatest poet / writer / folk balladeer. THEFT, because now he is using that well earned fame to steal our money. This album is just plain awful. Very difficult to listen to his voice that really has failed. Other reviewers call as good as &quot;Blood On The Tracks&quot;, not quite sure how any music lover or audiophile can make such as statement. DO NOT WASTE YOUR CASH ON THIS!! Have tickets to his 11/23 show, hope he doesn't promote the album!!!!!
B000002GHH|5.0|For anyone who has heard this masterpiece... this is a perfect marriage of songwriting, producing and musicians. Combining all the elements of what makes a successful recording came together in 4 magical days. Producer John Chelew coordinated the union of musicians Jim Keltner, Nick Lowe, and Ry Cooder with Hiatt's powerful songs. The result? A classic... bringing out the best sounds from Hiatt ever recorded! To hear a similar perfect union, check out John Chelew's recent marriage of the Blind Boys of Alabama with the likes of Danny Thompson, Charlie Musslewhite, David Lindley and John Hammond... in what is probably the best recording they've ever made.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I think that the best movie I ever saw was Moulin Rouge.  I don't think that I have ever witnessed such an awesome movie.  Everything was great!  There are no complaints!  I think that Ewan McGregor was so great in this film.  He really put a lot of emotion into his role and it showed.  He plays the part of a romantic writer very well.  He is a great singer! Nicole Kidman is a good singer too and played her role well.  I think all in all it was an awesome movie!
0374250332|5.0|I chose to read this book for my history class, and I was not disappointed in the slightest.  This book has it all: adventure, courage, and satire.  It is the story of America's first astronauts, some of the bravest men and most skilled flyers in history.<br />The Right Stuff was also made into a movie, and although the movie was great, people who have seen it haven't gotten the full story of the early space program unless they read the book.  Wolfe creates several conflicts that don't show up in the film, such as the ambition of the X-15 astronauts to beat the Mercury Seven into space, as well as the conflict between man and machine.  The film ends when Cooper's Mercury 9 lifts off, and that is disappointing.  Wolfe's book describes how Cooper performed a manual re-entry and proved that the astronaut was truly a pilot and not an observer.  Wolfe also argues that Project Mercury, as well as the Soviet Vostok program, built mutual respect between the two nations and effectively ended the Cold War.<br />The book is quite accurate, as most of the events are corroborated by Gordon Cooper in his autobiography (which I also recommend.)  This novel will go down as a classic, and it will be read by generations to come.
B000001FS3|5.0|This is no doubt one of the best albums ever produced. I have worn out a CD already. My dad went through 3 vinyl's of this album. Containing signature tracks &quot;Where The Streets Have No Name&quot;, &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot;, and &quot;With Or Without You&quot; you can't go wrong. Contains the cream of the crop for U2 and is the culmination of their career in my opinion. I discovered new favorites in this CD with &quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot; and &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; as well as others. I have been known to start a road trip with this CD and not change it for 3-4 hours. If you are a U2 fan you already own this album, for those who do not YOU NEED THIS ALBUM!!! It ranked 65th on the all time sellers list. Need I say more?
B00005A46T|4.0|...I have both of their major-label LP's and I must say, yeah, they did get heavier, but they did not get more talented. The first reason I was much more satisfied by Mudvayne's L.D. 50 over Slipknot's self-titled was the presence of creativity, thought, and plain brilliance in Mudvayne's CD. I remember disliking the way that Slipknot's music was so unorganized and sloppy. It was like the music was just there to hurl expletives at me, and the music wasn't even that heavy! Well, Slipknot did improve in some ways with their follow-up IOWA, it's thrashier, heavier, and much better orchestrated than their first attempt. However, I didn't see any standout tracks except a handful, with most songs being a cycle of noise, no DJ work, screaming, more noise, and bushels of curses randomly being caught by ear over it all. It's not a real improvement over Slipknot's self-titled. What happened to songs like \\"Wait and Bleed\\", \\"Spit It Out\\", or even \\"Me Inside\\"? True, there are some moments, like \\"My Plague\\", \\"The Heretic Anthem\\", \\"Left Behind\\", and \\"I Am Hated\\"; yet it all sounds like a depressing cycle. I've liked Slipknot for a long time, and their music, although poorly done, IS listenable. Don't get me wrong, though. They are a good band. They do something that gives them an edge over most nu-metal bands, and Corey used to rap like no one's business. Unfortunately, that's all gone now. Slipknot's practically thrash metal now. That would be good, except that they can't match Sepultura, Fear Factory, or Pantera. Do yourself a favor, though. If you're not a big Slipknot-fan, and would like to hear some quality metal that sounds slightly similar, check out L.D. 50 by Mudvayne, or just get their first CD.
B000002OR4|5.0|Haunting, heartbreaking, somber, edgy; interwovenly the music of horror, the music of mourning, and the music of reflection; simultaneously universal and distinctively evocative of a real time and a real place, of a specific people with a particular suffering.<br />&quot;Auschwitz and Berkenau&quot; in particular is chilling.
B00005MP58|5.0|I absolutely love this version of &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice!&quot;  I can't even say how many times I have watched this over &amp; over; all 6 hours worth.  If you're a romantic at heart, or love period films, you'll love this.
B00000251N|5.0|my name is freeke galstaun,living in holland Soest.<BR>...since so many years I adore the voice of neil diamond. I have been to the concerts here in Holland,once with my belated mother,I still remember the song forever in blue jeans,also the remembrance of his spectaculair performance in rotterdam with jonathan living seagull. Never forget that.His voice makes me feeling calm,like being in a peaceful world.<BR>I think  neil diamond has a charisma,personality that also makes the songs he sings so special.<BR>He is one of the greatest singers in the world.
B00005NOZ6|5.0|Totally unappreciated in their time, Dream Theater continues to take the world by the pants and give them a wild ride of crazy and innovative works of art.  I am always amazed at the talent that flowes out of this band, on the cd's and especially live.  You can't miss this 'Once in a Lifetime' chance to buy a piece of coincidental history.  Long live progressive rock.  Go Eagles!

B00005OAIE|5.0|For a debut CD, &quot;Room For Squares&quot; cannot be beat. John Mayer has packaged all of his phenomenal live songs into a spectacular album that showcases his awesome talent.

0790729601|3.0|Eraser is exactly the kind of movie that demonstrates the paucity of Hollywood's imagination--not in filmmaking, but in celebrating its own peculiar achievements. Eraser never set out to be a &quot;good&quot; film, and it succeeds spectacularly at not achieving this goal. And why shouldn't Hollywood celebrate this kind of filmmaking? After Russell Crowe took best actor for Gladiator it seems apparent that the Oscars need entirely new categories: instead of best actor, how about best OVER-actor? Or &quot;Worst Dialogue Delivered Thoroughly Convincingly?&quot; It takes talent to go so far over the top that you come back again! I'd nominate James Colburn for &quot;Best Lee Marvin Impersonation&quot; and certainly James Caan would sweep the &quot;Most Intensely Smoked Cigarette&quot; category--can that guy suck smoke like nobody else! And Eraser might take &quot;Thinnest Thread of a Plot on Which Action Sequences Can Be Hung&quot;, although competition would be fierce. It would also be nominated for &quot;Coolest Sci-Fi Gun and Nozzle Flashes/Tracer Fire&quot; but wouldn't even get a mention for &quot;Most Buckets of Bullets&quot; or &quot;Most Buckets of Blood&quot;. Schwarzenegger himself could receive a lifetime achievement award for &quot;Most Throwaway Lines Obscured By An Accent&quot; which would complement his earlier &quot;Most Herculean Physique&quot; award nicely. And let's not forget the screenwriting--&quot;Biggest Thing In A Shot-Out Aquarium That You Know Is Coming The Instant You See It&quot; and &quot;Most Gratuitous Use of the Phrase 'Dos Vadanya' To Establish The Villain's Ethnicity Just In Case You Weren't Paying Enough Attention Earlier&quot;.<br />The Oscars sure would be a lot more fun if Chuck Russell ran them. And if he didn't like the outcome, he could always unleash the Man-Eating Crocodiles. We can but hope....
B00003CWTI|5.0|I have to say that P.T. Anderson is my favorite director. This is one of his best (it's tied with Hard Eight though). Great acting, script, and direction. Buy this one.
B00004STJD|5.0|I am not a fan of comedies- in fact, I hesitated to get, \\"Le diner de cons\\" (The Dinner Game) until I read other reviews and heard what a few French friends thought about this film. It is not at all the comedy you'd expect- so funny- laugh out loud funny but down to earth with a few moral messages hidden within the script. In many ways, it is easy to relate to each character's pros and cons. What a wonderful way to teach about man's flaws and more importantly, how we treat one another- through laughter-a modern Molière, maybe? Now, I want to see all of Veber's movies. This is an excellent film.
B000002KFJ|5.0|Great song-writing, good compositiion (if at times pompous- but hey, that's the point of hard rock/heavy metal).  Angst oozes from the tracks and the lyrics are thought provoking (but don't spend too much time mulling it over).
B00004XQ83|4.0|Since i saw the film I can't get &quot;man of constant sorrow&quot; out of my ears; all is very blue, very intense, this is great gone music wonderfully remade. Pardon my english.
B0000033P0|4.0|&quot;The Only Way&quot; / &quot;Infinite Space&quot; are trite, as well as everything else here.  The shining redemption comes with the first half of the album: Tarkus - perhaps the single best piece that ELP ever recorded.
0783229526|1.0|While this film may appear as being a painfully long and meaningless one, it really defined the counterculture of its decade. Nevertheless, with characters who'll suppose of such mind-bending pharmaceuticals as daily substances to indulge upon, unnecessary close-ups of vomit and urine, and swooping camera movements at any and every opportunity, this very atypical film is certainly not for everyone. But for the self-seeking and fans of Hunter S. Thompson... Director Terry Gilliam, a master of complex, bizarre visual imagery, does such an outstanding job in capturing the exact intensity and utter madness of Hunter S. Thompson's classic book, which really would come as to no surprise whatsoever, as the book itself became their script! Usually after having finished with a book that's based upon a film you've previously seen, you say to yourself: \\"The film was nowhere near as good,\\" unlike for this title, where both the film and book equally major. And, like the book, Gilliam really has you develop great sympathy for these very dysfunctional and fatuous people whom, as you sit there and observe of the many risks they so carelessly make, you really grow to love and don't want anything fatal to happen to them.   <BR>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a pseudo-psychedelic, very colorful and stylized comedy so funny, so excruciatingly funny that the mere thought of it will draw a smirk on your face, and perhaps even have you laugh, then. And I was quite amused over the idea that Gilliam actually went as far as allowing us to enter its characters' rather hazy and indefatigable world and see it all the way they do, merely to generate greater sidesplitting and outrageous moments that are of an ideal blend for a fanatical film its kind!<BR>The performances were just incredulously stunning! In fact, these vivid actors were so persuasive, you'll forget of the fact that they were even acting at all, let alone whom they were portrayed by. The very underrated Johnny Depp proves that he's a worthy actor who'll be willing to do anything for whatever roll that strikes his taste, as this one had following his approbation upon Thompson's inspirational book, which also had an affect onto Benicio Del Toro, who, when gaining that much weight for a roll, you know he's committed.
B000002U8G|4.0|Minimalist enthusiasts might enjoy &quot;Echoes&quot; - the only piece here that stands the test of time.  The other tracks seem to be Beatles' left-over rubble, filling an album-side's worth of material leaving the only worthwhile &quot;Echoes&quot;
B0000013GT|5.0|All of Outkast's albums are completely original and brilliant, but when it comes to a perfect flow throughout the entire cd with every single song just right ATLiens is my favorite. Jazzy Bell is my favorite song on it, a lot of people like Wheelz of Steel best. I can never stop listening to this Cd, it's always in my player in the car, work, and at home when I go to bed. It's my favorite Cd in the world, I'm so glad it was made.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie was, in fact, hilarious.  Buy it; you won't regret it.  There's not a whole lot to say, as most words are inadequate, but it is hilarious.  And dude, it's spelled NEWT.
B00005JCAA|5.0|Okie, I'm a sap. I really enjoyed this film, and fell in love with every character. Joe Black is great, and shouldn't be missed. Watch it with your signifigant other.
006109594X|5.0|Patrick Robinson is a great action read! If there are a few technical errors, who cares? Mr. Robinson has moved to #2 on my must read list. It is best if you read &quot;Nimitz Class&quot; before you read &quot;H. M. S. Unseen&quot;. This is a work of fiction and the characters are fiction, but there are continuing references throughout the Robinson &quot;series&quot; to one non-fiction individual. Robinson, a Brit, knows what a jerk this person is, and was!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|5 Stars. Instant classic. 'nuff said.
1563894696|2.0|This book is not great. Maybe you like the art.. OK, that's one thing. Personally, I don't. But even if I did, I'd like some writing to go with it.<br />People compare this to Frank Miller.. which I think is a very valid thing to do since it's intended as a direct follow-up to Miller's little masterpiece, &quot;Year One&quot;. First off, I should say that I think Miller's Batman stories are really works of literary genius, as good as many great novels. The Long Halloween can't really be a work of literary genius as there's barely even any writing in it. The whole book can be read in no time flat. Most of the supporting characters get no time at all, and I'm still confused as to why any of Batman's usual roge gallery was included since none of them are really used well, and since their presense begs for questions about their origins, all unexplained here. This is a follow-up to Year One, so where did all these people come from? From the laziness of the writers, that's where. The story of Harvey Dent is handled horribly as well. There's a huge gap between his story in Year One and where we pick up here, and we see almost nothing of him after his trasformation, and we don't get too deep inside his head during the actual transformation, because I guess thought balloons would muddy up the &quot;artwork&quot;. So what this leaves us for drama is basically just the moment where he gets acid thrown in his face. It's sad.. so's roadkill. So's this waste of nearly 400 pages. Almost as shameful is the endless parade of Godfather references trying to act as if they're homages when all they are is further excuses for new creation. My main problem with this all can be summed up in one word: Density. As in total lack thereof. Miller would have used about 3 pages to tell this story, and then taken us inside Harvey's head for the rest of the book, and then ended it in a way that reinforced the genius of his allegory. This book ends with Batman punching people. Even if you don't expect this to be a masterpiece like Frank's work, which I (perhaps foolishly) did, it's still just not very good. <br />To compare this with Frank Miller is just nuts.. He usually has more than 3 words on a page, for one thing, and his characters usually do something. To compare the art to Watchmen.... well, lets just not even go there.<br />This is the only Batman book I've ever been sorry I bought.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|5 Stars. Instant classic. 'nuff said.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|Although the music on this CD is nothing compared to the absolutely breathtaking singing in the movie, I have to say that I am pleased with this CD.  Still they left many great songs such as &quot;Like A Virgin,&quot; &quot;Spectacular Spectacular,&quot; and most importantly of all, &quot;The Show Must Go On.&quot;  I mean, how could they do this to all of us, Oh well!  This will have to do until the release of this DVD before Christmas!!!
B00005A46T|5.0|I've never been a real fan of loud, metal music, but this cd is sooo awesome! The music is great and the lyrics to the songs are well written. My favorite songs are Everything Ends, Left Behind, I Am Hated, The Heretic Anthem, and well, if i wrote any more i'd have pretty much the entire cd written out. If you dont have this cd, you really need to go and buy it! Even if you dont care for slipknot, buy the album for the pure hell of looking at the booklet inside of the cd. It is one of the most creative cd covers and booklets ive ever seen. This album rocks!
B000002J1F|4.0|This is a great album. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the &quot;solo&quot; pieces. They make the members come off as a little self-important. &quot;Cans and Brahms&quot;, Rick Wakeman's piece, doesn't seem to gel with the rest of the album; it's an anomaly that would have worked better somewhere else (eg. on Mr. Wakeman's &quot;The Classical Connection&quot;). &quot;We Have Heaven&quot;, by Jon Anderson, fits, but I would have trimmed about 30 seconds from it; it seems to drag on a bit for a vocal piece. Bill Bruford's &quot;Five Per Cent for Nothing&quot; is wholly forgettable, which is sad considering his remarkable talent (his work with Crimso and Earthworks are highly recommended). &quot;The Fish (Shindleria Praematurus)&quot;, the Chris Squire vehicle, is a little too abstract; it feels as if it was thrown together at the last minute. The only standout is &quot;Mood for a Day&quot;, by Steve Howe; Mr. Howe never seems to disappoint (except for when he sings).<BR>The rest of the album is classic YES. &quot;Roundabout&quot; is about as classic as they come, and I'm surprised the rest of the band oriented tunes don't get as much attention.<BR>A must have.
B00000IMCW|5.0|[...] This is essentially the print released during the original 1978 release; the only difference is some additional material added during the police dock scene.  The Cannes cut and the so-called \\"Director's Edition\\" are interesting, but not what Romero intended for domestic audiences.<br />That being said, \\"Dawn\\" is no ordinary horror film!  So many reviewers completely miss the point. DOTD, in my view, does NOT suffer from anachronism.  Indeed, this brilliant satire of consumerism is very appropriately set during the 1970s. The excess, the self-absorption of the \\"me\\" decade is a perfect backdrop. The special effects are indeed cartoonish and not particularly scary. This is perfectly appropriate for the satirical nature of a film that some interpret as a very dark sarcastic tragedy.<br />The film is a continuation of the scenario of \\"Night of the Living Dead\\".  The recently dead have risen and are attacking the living.  \\"Dawn\\" starts 3 weeks after \\"Night\\", and the living dead have begun to get the upper-hand over humanity.  To make matters worse, many of the human survivors refuse to acknowledge the situation, in some cases inciting rioting, looting, and violence among the remaining human population.  Four survivors from diverse backgrounds take to the skies in a traffic helicopter to find refuge, and they land in a shopping mall in an area overrun by the living dead.  The quartet manage to wall themselves within the mall and set up a small survivor colony.  The nearly limitless supply of goods and diversions in their shopping mall citadel appeals to their natural consumerism, and they spend the next several months in a fog of denial and overconsumption.  Of course, such a short-sighted society will eventually feed upon itself and collapse...<br />Those viewers wanting brutality and violence by themselves (without the interference of Romero's subtext) will not especially enjoy this film.  Alternative films directe by  Fulci, HG Lewis, etc. should satisfy this audience.  There had never been a film like this up until 1978, and it's unfair to compare DOTD with its successors.<br />Technical details are average across the board, note that details about the aspect ration can be found on IMDB and elsewhere.  Extras are sparse; this film cries out for at least a directors commentary and digital cleanup.  There are rumors of a future Anchor Bay edition containing much more than this package offers; in the meantime, this edition will occupy a needed place in a thinking person's horror collection.  See \\"Document of the Dead\\" (dir: Roy Frumkes) for an informative but dry commentary on the making of \\"Dawn\\".ence.  There had never been a film like this up until 1978, and it's unfair to compare DOTD with its successors.<br />Technical details are average across the board, note that details about the aspect ration can be found on IMDB and elsewhere.  Extras are sparse; this film cries out for at least a directors commentary and digital cleanup.  There are rumors of a future Anchor Bay edition containing much more than this package offers; in the meantime, this edition will occupy a needed place in a thinking person's horror collection.  See \\"Document of the Dead\\" (dir: Roy Frumkes) for an informative but dry commentary on the making of \\"Dawn\\".
B000001ESP|5.0|How often can you listen to an album and get the distinct impression that you're listening to a greatest hits collection. This is one of those times. Every song is penned with intensity and purpose, which caused them to be vastly palpable commodities. The musicianship is impeccable, which is a must for any progressive rock player. This music is challenging stuff: the seeming simplicity draws you into a greater underlying complexity that is rarely achieved in rock music. This kind of dualism is normally only found in jazz and classical music. But you have to remember that this band (along with King Crimson and Yes) came out of the same wellspring as such fusion bands as the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Return to Forever, Tony Williams Lifetime and Weather Report. Rush was to come a little later, but are of the same pedigree. Neal Peart is no stranger to jazz, having contributed to an album titled &quot;Burning for Buddy&quot; (a tribute to jazz drummer Buddy Rich that also featured Bill Bruford from both Crimso and Yes and who now heads his own jazz combo, Bill Bruford's Earthworks). This background is never taken for granted in Rush. They utilize everything that is at their disposal to create lush sonic pictures (enhanced by Mr. Peart's deft lyrics). I could write about the songs themselves, but you've heard them all on your local classic rock radio station. If you can get past Geddy Lee's voice (and it took me a while to get used to it, I had to go by way of Jon Anderson), this music will be of great interest.<BR>Possibly the best Rush endeavor.
B00004Y87O|5.0|Of all of the films screaming for a DVD Special Edition, \\"Escape from New York\\" is at the top of the list. There must be 1,001 untold stories about the creation of this film...and the treatment on VHS and DVD to date has been spartan, at best.<br />My feeling is that this film should be reedited a bit, particularly in the beginning. I'm not a big fan of exposition, but if you watch the film, there is an odd moment. When Snake is in the glider headed for the City, he asks Hauk what to do if he finds that the president has been killed. Hauk replies \\"Get 'em both back\\". Both of what? There's a snippet of dialog missing. (Hauk is clearly speaking of the President AND the tape, but it's not clear).<br />If it were made by a lesser filmmaker, EFNY would be unrecoverably dated. But the film is so engaging that there is a timeless quality to it.<br />Call him Snake.
B000002J1H|4.0|I'll admit, I only have this one on vinyl, so I don't listen to it as much (I try to keep my vinyl in as good of a condition as possible), but I know enough to make a few comments.<BR>First off, and this doesn't reflect on the music, WHERE IS ROGER DEAN!!?? His YES covers are hallmarks of rock art and are some of the best in the business. Sure Hipgnosis is great, but I don't wanna look at some dude's behind when I pick up a YES album (frankly, I ain't too enamored with the breasts on the CD and jacket design for the &quot;Time and a Word&quot; album).<BR>But, the Music calls. What happened in the mid to late 70's that made YES go all pop? Where's the prog? Hey, this is great music, but if I wanna hear great late 70's YES, I'll throw on &quot;Tormato&quot;.
0060920084|1.0|This book was practically forced into my hands by someone who knows I am from the MidWest, not far from Kankakee, which Bryson mentions on page 42....and my daughters went to school in DeKalb, the very name of which Bryson finds unpleasant.  I consider myself somewhat &quot;cosmopolitan,&quot; having grown up in Chicago and now living in San Jose, but I spent 25 years in the middle of my life in one of those sleepy little farm towns with the grain elevators.  Those people he depicts as dumb, uneducated, totally uninformed, etc. are really the backbone of America, the people who keep her fed, working, taxes paid, etc.  It's also very odd to me that we all know it is politically incorrect to point out people's differences or features or disabilities and make fun of them.  We can't make ethnic jokes or &quot;gimp jokes&quot; without being thought insensitive.  Yet in page after page, he makes disparaging remarks about any overweight person he encounters, even if he thinks he is being clever by calling them &quot;clammy&quot; or &quot;meaty.&quot;  He makes an automatic judgement that each of those overweight persons (usually a woman is his target) is somehow unworthy, not interesting, not entirely clean, sloppily dressed, and not a good wife or mother.  If you think this is an exaggeration, re-read those paragraphs.  Apparently to him, being fat is the number one sin in mid-America.  <BR>   Yes, some towns have only a gas station and a Dairy Queen and their idea of a good time is the annual summer all-town picnic.  But that's their life.  The idea of traveling is to observe and to enjoy the culture, food, scenery, and ideas of others, not to laugh at it and go away smugly congratulating yourself on being &quot;better than them.&quot;  <BR>    I tried, but I could not finish this book.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Absolutely incredible album... Their best to date, although their other albums, particularly their recent efforts, are also stellar. Every song on the record is amazing... Paranoid android is a masterpiece... Totally different themes and elements coming together seemingly randomly to create a piece of music that is stunning. The guitar riff is killer. Airbag- what a great ballad... haunting melodies are great. Tourist is a great song, too, and the lyrics apply to just about everybody. Fabulous album, great band... Certainly one of the 3 greatest albums of the 90s
B00003CXWV|5.0|First and foremost, the dvd extra's such as the interview with George Jung, Ted Demme and George Jung discussing the movie, and commentating was excellent. The music/vocals by Nikki Costa creates a very sombering moment and when viewing the last moments of the film it makes you even sadder for George Jung. Johnny Depp did an excellent job of bring this character to life and I have to admit that I felt sorry for him in the end. The thing that I admired about George was his sense of independnce and freedom, even though it came at a cost due to personal choices. I think most people begin to care for George when his daughter arrives and that changes your opinion about him slightly. Regardless this film was fantastic and would be a great addition to anyone's personal library.
B000002KAT|5.0|This is not only Morrison's era-defining masterpiece, his &quot;Pet Sounds,&quot; or &quot;White Album,&quot; it is one of the finest albums ever made, Period. Nostalgic, spiritual, rambling, and poetic, &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; captures the sounds of a fragmented soul and makes them sound beautiful. In a stream of conciousness, Morrison breaks our hearts and rebuilds them again in new shapes, letting his bluesy voice soar and whisper through classics like &quot;Cypress Avenue,&quot; &quot;Sweet Thing,&quot; and &quot;Madame George.&quot; Morrison would never again come close to reaching these hights, even on the much heralded &quot;Moondance,&quot; but few would. This is an experience everyone should have.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|The range and inventiveness of the songs' musical styles and arrangements are what first struck me, from guitar-and-drum driven rock and roll rambles to violin-sweetened crooning. Then I began to listen closely to the lyrics, which again arc from surrealism of the kind Dylan first featured on albums like &quot;Bringin' It All Back Home&quot; to knock-knock jokes, with much of the content composed of unexpected juxtapositions of lyric fragments from old blues and folk songs. Yet whole new stories emerge.<br />I have owned the disk since last Monday (although it seems like much, much longer ago, for so many reasons), and I've listened to it nearly non-stop, so to say that I find it compelling is an understatement. Yet it would be difficult for me to recommend &quot;Love and Theft&quot; to anyone who did not already hold Dylan in high regard; his voice is so ragged and raspy that he makes Tom Waits sound like Paul McCartney by comparison. I suspect that it would put most folks off. <br />But a thought occurred to me - the comparative grotesqueness of his voice is not unlike Marlon Brando's weight: The expressive power of these people makes qualities like body size or sweetness of voice simply irrelevant. There are just not many individuals who can create whole characters and worlds with just a few phrases. When they do what they do, you just can't help being drawn in.
0446677450|5.0|This book is an outstanding and remarkable hit.  The style is simple so every kind of reader could understand.

0345442989|4.0|In this novel, we see more of the high-calibre writing talent of James Luceno, who previously scripted two of the New Jedi Order (NJO) novels.  <br />Luceno does a masterful job of capturing the essence of characters that many will recognize, including the eventual Moff Tarkin, Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi (as a youth of course), and a host of others.  Other characters make appearances, including: Vergere, who seems to be playing a part in the NJO series, a Jedi Master named Cboath, a newly elected leader named Amidala, and two jedi whom we saw face Darth Maul in Shadow Hunter.  Luceno has done a great job of keeping the reader guessing on exactly what the eventual goal of the plot being hatched by dissidents really is.  Of course it turns out that Sidious has been orchestrating things very far in advance.  But we are also able to see the even Palpatine cannot plan EVERYthing, as he exhibits some doubts and slight apprehensions during the story.<br />The novel takes place some weeks before Shadow Hunter, and thence before Phantom Menace.  Luceno, as mentioned, did an excellent job in incorporating all those things we know to have taken place, but also in rounding out HOW they came about.  I think that this is an excellent lead-in to Phantom Menace, better than Shadow Hunter.  <br />I have read that many feel the book moves too slow.  Well, it may seem so, but for those with patience, it takes only a moment's thought to realize how much work went into planning the outcome.  It is clearly worth any perceived effort.  Much of what we see is political machinations, a great deal of course being orchestrated by Palpatine.  We are able to see how he was able to position himself to be the successor to the Chancellor's post.  <br />Much of the story also hinges upon the pursuit of some criminals by the Jedi, particularly Qui-Gon Jin.  We are able to see how he was unable to remove a momentary focus from his mind, as we know later proved to be his undoing.  There is also Jedi combaton a scale not appreciated before the NJO series, as we see a relatively large gathering of Jedi working in concert against a much numerically larger foe.  When you read this, you will know why the Jedi were so feared by criminal elements, and by Palpatine.<br />I don't know that I could give much more praise to this book than I have already.  I am sure that most Star Wars readers already have this one, but I would like to recommend this to those that may have been soured on Star Wars after Phantom Menace came out.  I know of many that claimed they did not understand what it was all about.  Well folks, here is the background that will answer your questions.
B000005QH3|5.0|Quite simply THE BEST 70S ROAD MOVIE EVER.......EVER. Its better than Two Lane Black Top, Aloha Bobby and Rose, Bullit (although that was 68' I think), Gone In 60 Seconds (the 1974 original not the Nic Cage [one]!), Driver, Duel, Cannonball Run, American Grafiti(sorry don't know how you spell grafiti). It really is the best. And the car is just to good for words!
B00003ZKS1|5.0|I just re-purchased this album - I first bought it on tape back in the 80s and wore it out.  Schenker's second solo album, MSG, was almost as good, but this first album is Schenker at his finest.  Rapier sharp playing, distinctive flying V sound, great songs, even Gary Barden performing well.  It was a pleasure to listen to again.
B0000028RR|5.0|Not alot of albums have such huge impacts as this one. Before this was released, no band or musician was this political, this anarchic and definatly not his defiant! The picture on the front of the album shocked people, the lyrical content shocked people, and what really shocked people was the fact that every track on the album was created using only guitars, drums and lyrical talent. Th eband seemed to pride themselves on the fact that there was no artifical sounds on the cd. Good on them. It appears that by doing this, they wanted to put an emphasis on their own talent and not cheat by using synthetic sounds.<br />The music is firey, powerful and very angry. When listening to tracks such as &quot;Bullet In The Head&quot;, &quot;Bombtrack&quot; and &quot;Killing In The Name Of&quot;, you are drawn into Zack De La Rocha's anger by the powerful solos and fierce distortion. The three above tracks are brilliant and are some of my personal favourites. One other beinf &quot;Wake Up&quot; which was featured in the motion picture: &quot;The Matrix&quot;. The fact that the film stood for everything R.A.T.M did makes their vision of how the world is now become reality. Yes we are being controlled and opressed and I feel that the band put this over splendidly in all of their albums, their first album however is just a small insight into what's wrong with the world today.
B000002NHN|5.0|I bought this CD based on reviews I read, so I was a little unsure what to expect.  After listening to it, I loved this collection.  Very, very good indeed.
B000003TAW|5.0|In the early ninties, it was all about MC Hammer and who could have the biggest flat top. From these trying times emerged a band truly devoted to the rock scene. Weezer is a band known for it's catchy lyrics and deep thoughts. With some amazing guitar riffs and lyrics that relate, the band puts together what can be called their best album. This album has sold consistently for the past 8 years, proving it's strength through time. With ten songs including the hit &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; this CD is sure to please anyone. Highly recommended, five stars. A truly incredible peice of work.
B000002GQK|5.0|This is the first Moody Blues CD that I bought.  It is a wonderful album that is delightfully mixed.  I have enjoyed a great many hours listening to this album.  The album is very even in terms of presentation by the members.  The mix of the Moody Blues is awesome in its own right and it is accurately dipicted in this album.  I highly recoomend it for its wonderful mix.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I never would have thought that I could EVER listen to a cd as much as I have listened to Alicia Keys or Jill Scott, but this sistagirl from the ATL has done it! From her debut, &quot;Video&quot; to &quot;Wonderful,&quot; her tribute to Stevie Wonder, india.arie provides mellow, thought provoking music that continues to play in your head even when the cd is no longer playing. I literally just lose myself in the music. Her sultry &quot;Brown Skin&quot; is what intially made me buy the album, but there is so much more. &quot;I See God in You&quot; is a truly beautifully written song, and &quot;Ready for Love&quot; is an emotional ballad that everyone can feel or relate to. It's hard to say which song is the best, since all represent an amazing effort on her part to provide her listeners with only the best. Clearly, india.arie has more soul than one can ever imagine. Her voice is smooth and her energy is refreshing. Whether it is an uptempo song full of inspiration (Strength, Courage &amp; Wisdom) or a slow jam (Beautiful), trust me, this woman will have you feeling music like you never have before. Like she says in &quot;In my Head,&quot; &quot;I am but a vessel, so I sing.&quot; And girl, you are doing an amazingly good job of it!
B000001EGA|5.0|This is the great album of EJ and BT musical biography.  They  once again show the music world that they are a great music combonation.  The album is amost his greatest and one of the greatest recordings in the 1970s  (that goes for most of EJ's albums).  The album is very enjoyable to listen to as EJ and BT have proven that their formula for good music is well lasting.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Let me say at the outset that &quot;Hannibal&quot; is not a sequel to &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot;  Once you realize that the two works stand on their own it is much easier to appreciate the two.  To be sure, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is infinitely more obvious than it's predecessor.  &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; was more Clarice's story whereas this one is Hannibal's.  Nor is there any compromise whatsoever in Julianne Moore's performance.  She is quite simply, excellent.  Jodie is not missed at all.  Anthony Hopkins does a masterful job of recreating Dr. Lecter.  The soundtrack which is positively beautiful while outlining some of the most grotesque scenes of violence I have ever witnessed only add to  the wonder of the production.  The shots of Florence are spectacular. Top notch!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000001DQI|5.0|As being an Elton John fan, one can enjoy hours upon hours of his music.  In the remastered album, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, you get exactly that.  This album features so many great songs, including the feature track and the forever famous, Candle in the Wind (orginal recording).  This album truely defines Elton as a Great amongst the Great in the music industry and it was one of his first albums that he released!  His work with Bernie Taupin is magical with all the songs blending together that are on the album.  I enjoy listening to this album not only for its greatness but because it is enjoyable to listen to.
0783226063|3.0|not the long version but otherwise ok Dune 2000 is better.
B000002U94|5.0|Seger is best known for his live performances.  If you don't own any live Seger album, buy Live Bullet first, and Nine Tonight second.  There is no way to couch this language: Live Bullet is better.  Nine Tonight is a great performance of later Seger hits live, but Live Bullet is the zenith of Seger's career.<br />That said, this is a great live album.  You find songs here that are great hits, and mysteriously don't even appear on Seger's Greatest Hits CD.  This is an essential album for any fan, even peripheral, of Seger.<br />Disclaimer:  I'm from Detroit, and anyone from Detroit has a jaded view of Seger.
B00005670G|4.0|Cool stuff. Real hard-rock, just like it should be. Fans of Quiet Riot, Danger Danger, Ratt and Kix! You will like it. Rock on.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Just a great album!  It's a great entry album for the new jazz listener as well as for her long time fans.  She continues to be one of today's best vocalist.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is one of the best discs I have bought in a long time.  I was turned onto Mayer's music by a college friend.  This young artist shows some much depth in his lyrics.  I enjoy all of the tracks and look forward to seeing more of John as the years go on.  This is someone to look out for.  He is going places!<br />Oh I also just saw him for the re-release party of this album last night...., if you get a chance..., see him play live.  It's incredible.
B00005N919|3.0|I'll get over the formalities and cut right to the chase: &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; has some great acting by a wonderful cast, and a conceivably good story, but in the hands of director Paul Verhoeven, who is well-known for his use of style over substance, the mystery and psychological inklings fall increasingly short of suspenseful, leading us up to twist after twist, some of which work, others that founder. His sense of direction is in the right place, but the way in which he takes us where he wants us to go is surprisingly joyless, and without intensity. <br />The film begins, fittingly enough, with a sex scene, in which a former rock star, who is now a prestigious community member in San Francisco, is murdered with an ice pick after intercourse by an unseen blonde woman. This brings detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) to the attention of the sultry author Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), who was last seen with the murder victim. It also doesn't help that the murder is an exact reenactment of a similar event in one of her novels. <br />At first, Curran seems turned off by Tramell's forthrightness in her testimony of her relationship with the victim, and is certain that a lie detector test that proves her innocent is wrong. But as he begins to dig his nails into clues, he also finds himself mesmerized by her, and by the danger he feels in playing head games with her as she does with him. His life begins to take a nose dive: he begins smoking and drinking again, and becomes so infatuated with Tramell that he becomes even more determined to prove her innocent. <br />So does all of this really work? Some elements do, such as the wonderful acting and sometimes witty dialogue exchanges, but others, such as ambiguous clues and lurid sex scenes, do not. The movie is worth it to see the terrific talents of its cast, but take them out of the equation, and what you have is a skin flick spiced up with a Hollywood makeover. <br />The movie's two main stars are its central attractions, featuring some very effective work from Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone, who play their parts with a wicked wit and devilish fun. Douglas embodies the obsession in his character like a pro, using emotion and body language to confirm Curran's descent into infatuation. Stone steals the show, not only with her provocative figure shots, but with the excellent wit she employs in her dialogue. Exchanges between the two characters are impressive, if not eerie. <br />The murder mystery is intriguing, for the most part. It keeps us waiting until the ending, to let us know the final answer that will solve everything we've been suspecting. Each clue left to us by the story has two different paths, one that points to another possible suspect as the killer, and one that points to the until-now prime suspect Tramell. The final shot answers this question, but lessens the effect of the picture as a whole because we come to realize just how much the movie toys with us, leading us to believe one thing, and then betraying the trust we have put into Tramell. <br />The movie serves little other purpose other than to show off director Verhoeven's virtuoso style as he invites us on a very lurid trip into obsession. He fills the canvas with over-the-top sex scenes, which do little to enhance the effect of the film. There are scenes that work nicely, such as the interrogation scene, in which Tramell coolly shifts in her chair giving the detectives a clean view of her mid-section; the shock on their faces is priceless. But the movie also contains its fair share of gratuitous sex, which comes close to crossing the boundaries of soft and hard-core erotica. This is more of a turn-off, and may even provoke snickers rather than a serious approach. <br />In summation, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; has all the good parts of a thriller, but the bad parts outweigh them heavily. The acting is stellar, while the central plot is full of mystery. Too bad that Verhoeven trades in a good dealfor cheap pornography and an ending that revokes everything we've been lead to believe from the beginning.
B000002J09|5.0|I'll start by stating the obvious - This is not Led Zeppelin's best album. Not by a long shot. I could never quite decide which is the best one, but IV (aka Untitled, aka Rune Album, aka Zoso) is not that. It's extremely commercial, designed to be successful (and that worked, by the way; another problem of the album is that so many of the songs - especially Stairway To Heaven - have been so terribly overplayed on the radio and, well, anywhere else.) In order to achieve that, the band cleaned their act a little, smoothed some rough edges. The blues influences, very powerful on the first album, are present, but very lightly and moderately. The music still rocks, but not half as loud and rough as LZ II or III. Instrumental segments are kept to a minimum, because that kind of stuff doesn't sell. Sure, the four minute drum solo that is Moby Dick and the long jamming on Dazed And Confused are two of the highlights of the first albums, but how many of your avarege rock-pop fans have the patience for that? Also, the production is dreadfuly clean. Some of the best songs on the album could have benefited a lot from a rougher sound, and indeed sounded a lot better when played live (see the Black Dog performance on 'The Song Remains The Same'.)<br />It's just because of this that Led Zeppelin IV is the perfect Led Zeppelin album for the non-Led Zeppelin fan, or, on the other hand, the perfect introduction to the band for someone who thinks Led Zeppelin equals Stairway To Heaven. Those are sure to enjoy singing along to old favorites like Stairway and Rock And Roll, as well as the lesser known Going To California and Misty Mountain Hop while When The Levee Breaks and Black Dog prepare them for the real Led Zeppelin (albums I-III). Later they can listen to 'The Song Remains The Same' to hear those songs performed like they should be, and hear the brilliant playing of Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and John &quot;Bonzo&quot; Bonham at full power.<br />There is, despite everything, awonderful selection of songs here. Black Dog, a slightly bluesy track, is a marvelous song (though it sounds much better live), with powerful, soulful singing from Robert Plant. Rock And Roll is a fast, catchy rocker, the kind of tune that gets stuck in your head and gives you a strange, irresistable urge to sing along, tap your feet, or, in more extreme cases, play your air guitar or drum on the nearest available solid object. Lacking the depth of heavy metal classics like Whole Lotta Love and Immigrant Song, Rock And Roll is still extremely fun. The Battle Of Evermore is a brilliant, unusual turn for Page and Plant, and probably the only song which sounds fantastic in this clean, smooth production. It's the height of Led Zeppelin's Tolkien and mysticism obsession, and sounds like nothing else they've ever done. Stairway To Heaven, while it is one of the most overplayed songs in history, is still an excellent epic song with some great moments.<br />Side B is slightly weaker; Misty Mountain Hop, Four Sticks and Going To California are all great tracks, but none is especially original or memorable. Misty Mountain Hop is a song which was probably made to be heavy metal but was softened and cleaned. Four Sticks is heavier, but nothing exceptional. And Going To California is a sweet little ballad, a nice song but really too smooth for Led Zeppelin. The whole thing, though, is saved by When The Levee Breaks. Some of the negative reviews on this album said that the best song on it was When The Levee Breaks and it wasn't even their song. Yes, it is the best song on the album. No, it's not a Led Zeppelin original. I wonder, though, how many of the reviewers who made this comment actually heard Memphis Minnie's original song, because the two have very little in common; the brilliance of this track is Led Zeppelin's arrangement, which turned a good old blues song into one of Led Zeppelin's heaviest, dirtiest, most powerful pieces of music. Bonham, Page and Jones did a brilliant job, not to mention Plant who brought out his harmonica for the recording. After hearing this album, try to find a live recording of the song. It's guaranteed to blow your mind.<br />Whether or not you're a Led Zeppelin fan, this album is a must, an essential part of every collection. There's something here to please anyone, and if When The Levee Breaks is tough on your eardrums, listen to Stairway To Heaven again, or try Going To California. If you are a fan, don't have a grudge against this album because it was so successful - there's nothing wrong with compromising a little to expand one's audience.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|This is simply the best cd I have purchased this year.  My favorite songs are Poses, Rebel Prince and In a Graveyard. Haunting melodies and clever lyrics. Music of rare beauty.
6302000823|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, it's sweet, sentimental, comical and sad all at the same time.  Listening to the language is like listening to someone sing, and the words are just beautiful.  I enjoyed it so much when I rented it from the video store, I bought it the next day.  It's a good date movie, a good girly movie, and just an all around feel good movie about life, love and happiness.
0743216385|3.0|I'm a WWII history buff and I enjoyed this book, found it hard to put down.  It's very detailed and well written.  I only give it 3 stars because it seemed a bit short.  There were only 2 pages of photos!?  What happened to visual history?  And there were no maps!  This is a pet peeve of mine when it comes to history books.  Why is it so hard for an author to include some maps--or better yet, battle diagrams--to coincide with what it being written about?

6301967984|5.0|I can remember wanting to see &quot;The Exorcist&quot; when it came out. I was only twelve at the time and living in London where it was rated &quot;CERT X&quot;. My parents went and saw it and when I asked my mother what was all the fuss, she replied , Oh, things fly around in this little girl's room........ That was all I got....<BR>Well, my mother is still a practicing Catholic so I'm sure she NEVER wants to view that film e v e r again ...... I had the same desire to see Salo 120 Days of Sodom, the same anticipation... I have to say that Salo 120 Days of Sodom is a visceral piece of anti-fascist film.... Taking DeSade's &quot;classic&quot; and moving it to his then , perhaps present, Italy,<BR>Pasolini truly shows us the horrors of what I feel he felt in his heart and mind....Pasolini's films have always been hard to take, and many people dismiss him under the label of &quot;boring art~house film maker&quot;, I think he was a brave, outspoken man who just didn't care about other's opinions of his work and finally was murdered for his beliefs. He was a fierce, loyal artist of the soul, and as for those who say this is a sleazy film to watch, I prefer John Water's early films for fun, groovy, Divine sleazy trash fun..... Salo is a difficult film to watch, on all levels, yet one that has stayed with me, just like &quot;The Exorcist&quot;...Or for that matter &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;...All films mentioned pure genius.........
B00000G3PA|1.0|This movie is probably the dividing line between the sheep and everone else. People with flock mentalities like &quot;Armageddon&quot; because Liv is sooo cute, things go boom and make big yellow explosions, and every character has some sort of vocal handicap that limits their speech to cheesy one-liners. To say this film is bad is to insult truly bad films, which are campy because the filmmakers were trying to make something good and just didn't know what they were doing or have the money to put it on the screen. But this IS exactly the movie Michael Bay set out to make--The Gone With The Wind for stupid people. And stupid people love it! I know, I work in a video store. It's scary.
B00003CX9E|5.0|He was going to find rosebud! <br />For me, the turning point is when Kane is waiting curbside to go to a wherehouse and look through things from his mothers ranch in Colorado. Instead, he decides to fall in love with Susan Alexander. <br />Welles and Mankiewicz prove Charlies self-destruction his self-loathing here. Its so subtle. Kane was terrified of finding his own history, roots, freedom, happiness. He sabotaged his self-discovery. He denied himself the childhood world of play (remember Thatcher's christmas gift of a sled?).<br />Forget the backstory, forget the technology, forget the mood and the &quot;firsts&quot; and the black and white.<br />Films live on the writing, and this writing, this storytelling is as good as it gets!

B00005NZBN|5.0|Seriously, if you have ever enjoyed Bobs work, you need this album! But firstly, do not buy it expecting more of 'Time Out Of Mind', in typical Dylan style, the albums are completely different. Dylan has never made two albums that sound alike. Historically, Dylan always works against all expectations of him. Look at 'Blonde On Blonde' which he followed with 'John Wesley Harding', the albums are miles apart. Same with 'The Times They Are A Changin' and 'Bringing It All Back Home', 'Blood On The Tracks' and 'Desire', 'Oh Mercy' and 'Under The Red Sky' etc. 'TOOM' and 'Love And Theft' follow this tradition.<BR>But back to 'Love And Theft'. What a great album. Whereas 'TOOM' was very deep, dark and moody, on 'L&amp;T' Bob Sounds like he is having a lot of fun with it this time around, and it shows, many of the songs are very upbeat, and seem are even rocking. Many of these songs could have been written by a young Bob 35 years ago, thats how good they are. The writing style is, if anything, closer to 'Bringing It All Back Home' then anything else. The best track is without a doubt 'Mississipi'. This one track alone is worth buying the album for. That track is as good, if not better, then the best off of 'TOOM'. Another track that is almost as brilliant, and sounds almost like it could have been on 'Freewheelin' is 'High Water (for Charlie Patton)' Other stand out tracks are 'Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb', 'Po' Boy', 'Summer Days', and 'Lonesome Day Blues'. Great tracks.<BR>In the best Dylan tradition, one or two pointless tracks have found their way here, the prime suspects being 'Moonlight' and 'Bye and Bye', which arent very good, but are more then made up for by the other tracks. It wouldnt be a Dylan album if a couple of ridiculous tracks didnt make their way onto it. Also Bobs voice is sounding great! Much better then it sounded in 'TOOM'. Its probably his best vocals since 'Oh Mercy'.<BR>Overall, it isnt quite as good as 'Time Out Of Mind', but it never could be. This album will stand on its own as one of Bobs best, certainly if you dont count 'TOOM', this is the best Dylan album in over two decades. If you like Dylan, you should not be without 'Love And Theft'.
B00003CXX8|3.0|From the looks of the trailer, &quot;The Glass House&quot; looks really scary. Well, just to let you know, it's not. It was dropped in the &quot;thriller&quot; genre, but is not much of one at all. It has a lot of almost getting caught sneaking around type stuff. That is one disappointment. The other is how predictable everything is. I mean, I guessed everything correctly through the whole movie. Oh, well. The script is not as bad as some critics like to say it is. The acting is pretty good too. Leelee Sobieski (&quot;Joan of Arc,&quot; &quot;Here on Earth,&quot; &quot;Deep Impact,&quot; and in the upcoming thriller &quot;Joy Ride&quot;) who plays the main character, Ruby, does a superb job as always. The young actress is quite a beauty and is even considered the spitting image of Helen Hunt. If you like tense, almost to the edge-of-your-seat scenes, this movie is for you. If you don't like that kind of stuff, see &quot;Hardball.&quot; 13 and over for violence, some language, drug use, brief sexual suggestions, and sinister thematic elements.
0876852630|4.0|I like this novel, but certain passages I felt like I read in other novels by Bukowski.  It's a pleasure to read, but not as smooth as some of his other works.  He basically goes from job to job, occasionally having a fling, getting drunk, or going to the track.  If you're a Bukowski fan, buy this book only after you've read Post Office (dealing with a terrible job), Ham on Rye (childhood through adolescent), and Women (sex).  Certain passages make this a must read - but other Bukowski books are better.
0767802519|5.0|I think this film is a masterpiece. Luc Besson has beautifully directed this achievement and it is probably his best film (Fifth Element aside). The best thing about this film is the different emotions you feel. You feel hatred, happiness, worry, and sadness all for one character. Leon is a professional (hence the title) cleaner, or hitman. He is a very alone person who has no friends. He does have a soft spot for the 12 year old girl Mathilda(wonderfully portrayed by Natalie Portman). When Mathilda's family is killed, she stays with Leon, but she wants revenge. Leon begins teaching her the tricks of the trade which provides some very funny moments. They begin to get very close, and he feels love for the girl. I will not ruin the whoile story for you but it really is a must see.Jean Reno was born for this part and Gary Oldman plays the eccentric bad guy very well. This movie does have some explosive action scenes, but it is really more of a drama. Yes there is a directors cut which in my opinion isn't much better than the regular and the regular is 10 bucks cheaper. Buy this film either way and you will be wonderfully happy with your purchase.
6305546789|5.0|Way Better Than What Some Of The Reviews Are Saying! Some review is saying that there is no plot. That is true but in haloween 2 it sort of explains everything.

B00004YRQA|4.0|First of all, let me give my credentials so people understand that I know what I'm talking about:<BR>-I know a lot about computers, and take great interest in technology.<BR>-I have been a Playstation owner since 1997, and bought a PS2 just this year.<BR>-I have played MANY Playstation games, as well as PS2 games.<BR>-I have used several peripherals on both the PS1 and PS1, including the 128k and 8MB memory cards.<br />So, hopefully you believe me when I say that I know what I'm talking about.<br />With all of that out of the way, I would like to clear up a LOT of confusion. I have read many reviews on here. Most of them completely contradict the review that came right before it. Unfortunately, it seems that many people are just making things up off the top of their head, without having any real first-hand experience. <br />So, just what is the PS2 memory card capable of, and what is it compatable with? That's what I'm here to tell you.<br />First of all, the PS2 card has an 8MB capacity. It reportedly transfers data 200 times faster than the original PS memory card. Well, I haven't actually used a stopwatch, but it's true that the PS2 card saves and loads much faster.<br />Does the PS2 card work for PS1 games? Absolutely not. I've tried this with several PS1 games, testing them in both my PS1 console and PS2 console. Not a single PS1 game was able to tell that a memory card was even inserted in the slot. So, please disregard anyone who tells you otherwise.<br />Does the PS1 card work for PS2 games? Again, a big fat NO. Think about it. Forget about weather or not PS2 games is able to to use the card. The important issue is the size of the files versus the size of the card. Most of the files on my PS2 card range from 300 to 600k, which is 3-6 times the capacity of the card. Just forget about it.<br />One point of clarification I would like to make: the PS2 DOES recognise PS1 cards, but only if you are playing a PS1 game.<br />That should pretty much clear up any misconception.<br />As for my opinion of the PS2 card, I'll give it to you short and sweet: It's an essential part of the Playstation. As I said, it is very fast with its saves and loads. <br />My one problem with this peripheral is the price. I payed an easy $30 for one of these things in a discount store. COME ON! It's only 8 Megs! I know that Sony has to manufacture these things specially, but think about this: memory has gotten remarkably cheaper. <BR>If you were to try to sell 8 Megs of RAM, you'd be lucky to get a dollar for it. <BR>An 8 Meg hard drive? Forget about it. 50 cents, tops.<BR>7 floppy disks give about 8 megs, and 7 floppies cost around 4 dollars.<br />See what I'm getting at? I'm sure that there is a way to make these things cost much less than they do.<br />But, like I said, it's an essential part of the Playstation.
B00001R3GI|5.0|It seems strange that an album should be simultaneously old and new, but that's exactly what characterizes &quot;Exile On Main Street.&quot; It is an album that wallows in the vice-ridden lifestyle of the rock and roller--lewd, rowdy, and electric. At the same time it is not a youthful album. Its exuberance never stems directly from the same virginal thrill as Berry's &quot;Roll Over Beethoven,&quot; The Beatles' &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand,&quot; or even the Stones' own &quot;Let's Spend the Night Together.&quot; It's not an album of bright-eyed discovery, but rather an album of peculiar, muted sadness, and, ultimately, hope.<br />Its songs are pleas for recognition, for relief. In &quot;Rocks Off,&quot; Mick sings, &quot;I want to shout, but I can hardly speak,&quot; and this bears witness to the remainder of the album. Throughout, Mick's vocals are pushed back into the mix. The lyrics are frequently indecipherable, and reflect an unflinching, inescapable bleakness. The sneer has disappeared from his inflections. &quot;No good, can't speak,&quot; sings Mick in the fourth song, and &quot;Oh my, my, my, I'm the lone crap shooter, playing the field every night&quot; in the fifth. In &quot;Sweet Virginia,&quot; the sixth, he begs the subject to &quot;try to stop the waves behind your eyeballs,&quot; and implores: &quot;you got to scrape the s___ right off your shoes.&quot; In &quot;Torn and Frayed,&quot; an ode to the threadbare musician, the words ring out: &quot;Joe's got a cough, sounds kind of rough--yeah, and the codeine to fix it. Doctor prescribes drugstore supplies. Who's gonna help him to kick it?&quot; It's a consuming life, but &quot;just as long as the guitar plays, let it steal your heart away.&quot;<br />The music continues for more than an hour. Mick pleads with women for a taste of genuine affection, curses them for being fickle (&quot;diamond ring, vaseline--you give me disease&quot;), touches on domestic frustration, laments the impermeable anonymity of one-night stands, and cries for help from a girl with a sanctified mind. Friends and lovers are alien now, made strange by various concoctions of regret and sorrow. Sweet Virginia is bogged down by tremendous woe, and the vice-ridden subject of &quot;Shine A Light&quot; is too fractured by her (his?) own habits to escape destruction. However, the album ends on an energetic, soaring note with &quot;Soul Survivor,&quot; which heralds an end to a tempestuous love (&quot;where you are, I won't be&quot;), but testifies to an enduring spirit.<br />The themes of desolation, helplessness, sorrow, and despair are not original. Certainly the Rolling Stones have learned much from their idols, the blues musicians and songwriters. The Rolling Stones always had a gift for giving the blues an articulate, modern voice. Here their elaborations on the blues are extensive enough that they may have contributed something new to the mythology. These ARE the blues, but they are also the Rolling Stones'.<br />It is peculiar that part of what makes this album so articulate is its de-emphasis on immediate lyrical clarity, but this de-emphasis challenges the listener. It emphasizes the emotional power of the instruments, and encourages him/her to listen more closely to the lyrics. In addition, the interpretation of slurred lyrics [yes, this is intentional] gives the listener a more personal stake in the song.<br />This album is a tribute to rock and roll, and simultaneously to the blues [and the country] that spawned it. Its dense mix and sparse lyrics both challenge and draw in the listener. That it celebrates its roots, and not the high-minded prog-rock of the time, should not deter rock fans. If anything, the emotion caught on this record should serve as proof to successive generations that those roots are a powerful and legitimate art form.
B000002J29|4.0|Overall, this is an excellent live album and a must-have for any serious Genesis fan. This album is a selection of live recordings, mostly from a 1977 Paris concert. All the members of Genesis are spotlighted to good effect here. Tony Banks' keyboarding shines as usual, especially on &quot;Carpet Crawlers&quot; and &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot;. Steve Hackett (in his swan song with Genesis) also excels on &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot;, as well as &quot;Dance on a Volcano&quot;. His guitar is, to me, the highlight of what was best about the Genesis of the 70's, both under Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins. Mike Rutherford is never specifically highlighted, but his bass guitar provides a solid foundation throughout the album. Phil Collins was still fairly new to the role of lead singer and frontman, and it shows here. But, he turns in a solid performance nevertheless, and he does an excellent job of taking the older classics and making them his own. Not to be forgotten are the live drummers, Chester Thompson and Bill Bruford. They both do an excellent job of freeing Phil to come out and make the most of his frontman role. The songs presented here are not simply copies of the studio versions. Instead, Genesis takes a number of the songs and alters them slightly, blending different songs from different albums together in new and exciting ways. Examples of this are the seamless segue from &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; into the closing section of &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, The enjoyable jam session in &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; (including a bit of &quot;Stagnation&quot; from the Trespass album), and the closing set of &quot;Dance on a Volcano&quot; and &quot;Los Endos&quot;. Of course, this album also includes an excellent rendition of &quot;Supper's Ready&quot;. This song shows, more than any other, that Phil Collins was the best replacement for Peter Gabriel that Genesis could possibly have found (even though I'm pretty sure he forgot some of the words to &quot;Carpet Crawlers&quot;).<br />Now, having said all this, why didn't I give it 5 stars? The answer is simple - the mixing. While the various instruments all sound fine to me, Phil's voice is, in my opinion, WAY too far down in the mix. Especially on &quot;Squonk&quot; - his voice has a serious &quot;echo&quot; to it. I found that pretty distracting. His voice sounds much better on the future &quot;Three Sides Live&quot; and &quot;The Way We Walk&quot; live sets. But, all in all, that's a minor complaint for me. <br />God Bless America!
B000021Y7X|5.0|Unlike a lot of concert videos, this one was directed by a legitimate film director (Jonathan Demme - \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"), and is every bit as much of a visual experience as a musical one.  The concert in the film violates all the traditions of concerts - - it IS the Talking Heads, after all - - and has a lot of fun doing so.<br />Recorded late in the Talking Heads career (after \\"Speaking In Tongues\\"), it includes practically all the well-known songs.  The   songs are top-notch and so are the performances.<br />Importantly, there is enough going on visually throughout (something different every song), that our 8 year old enjoyed it completely too.
B000002UAU|5.0|Yes, what a shame. This CD is the greatest Beatles CD! Except for &quot;WITHIN YOU, WITHOUT YOU&quot;, they are all great hits.

The Beatles have to admit that they sound better and are sounding better all the time.
0446677450|5.0|This book is a primer in basic personal finance and in moving from making a living to becoming wealthy.  Instead of working for money, Kiyosaki states adamantly, your money should be working for you. The book is filled with examples, anecdotes, and simple diagrams to illustrate each of Kiyosaki's lessons on being wealthy.  Most of the examples revolve around the contrast in financial approaches between Rich Dad (Kiyosaki's childhood friend's father) and Poor Dad (Kiyosaki's own father.)<br /> <br />Among the many valuable ideas in this book, I particularly appreciated Kiyosaki's emphasis on the need to include &quot;financial literacy&quot; in our basic educational system.  I was also struck by the author's repeatedly stressing the need to be open to new ideas and taking risks rather than just playing it safe.  &quot;Listening is more important than talking,&quot; he writes.  I agree, and I have also found &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane to be an excellent resource to discovering great wealth in every sense of the word.  I am grateful to these authors for showing people what is possible and encouraging them to go for it.
B00000255F|5.0|No other grade to give it, nothing more to say. Perfection should be the name of this album. Tallent, Clemmons, Weinberg, Bittan and Bruce probably never imegined they would record something so impressive and everlasting.
0441003257|5.0|I've nothing profound to say here: this is, quite simply, my favorite book. Not my favorite British book, or my favorite fantasy book, or my favorite Gaiman/Pratchett book. Just... my favorite book. In the universe. There are absolutely no drawbacks to this book. Am I making myself clear? Also makes a sure-fire Christmas gift. (I don't bother lending mine to people, my copy is signed. For which I waited -- willingly and merrily -- in a six-hour line on two separate occasions in two different countries. And may I add, both authors are kind, delightful, and down to earth in person.)   <br />[Aside: I'm not quite sure I agree with all the comparisons to Douglas Adams, though I do love (and miss!!!) Adams -- I find that all three have a distinctly British humor -- that characteristic deadpan understatement and irony -- which is fine but not really profound as far as similarities go, as they *are* all British. Also, I'm pretty sure Pratchett predates Adams by quite a bit -- he is older than Adams was, and began publishing at age 13.]<br />I've had a lot of fun trying to decipher which bits are Terry's and which are Neil's. :-) The end result is so seamless. It's hilarious and heartbreaking (often simultaneously) and affirms the worth of humanity (even to those cynics like myself who might sometimes question it). Can you ask for more? This book is what the movie &quot;DOGMA&quot; *wishes* it could even begin to approach. These guys are couple of geniuses who should be long remembered.

I wonder what Bethoven, Mozart and others like them would think about that.<BR>For writing a review, I think you have to have at least a remote idea of what a band is about (I cant imagine a journalist or a critic talking about the lack of better space for keyboards in a Rollings Stones CD, or to much guitar in a Van Halens release).<BR>I mean, whats that about &quot;the inappropriate prominence of John Taylor's bass lines&quot;???... This is Duran Duran for God sake! It supossed to sound this way, why the bass has to be in the back of the mix, inaudible and shy? Because that reads the manual of instructions for rock and roll? Please... get a job B.B.<BR>Thanks.
0375703861|1.0|This novel has been in my to be read pile for several months and I was anxious to get to it based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews by critiques.  Wonderful, Astonishing, Funny as hell, the jacket promises.  I failed to see the humor anywhere.  What I found were angry ramblings in regard to characters that I dont think even the author particularly liked.  Ms. Smith touched on animal rights, radical organizations, love, friendship, war, marriage, religion, science, class and culture with such a brutal tone that I became more and more depressed with the turn of each page.  There was no focus of the 400+ pages which (I believe) led to a rather ridiculous and completely unsatisfactory end.  Im very sorry that I devoted the time I did to trudge through this great disappointment.
0060931736|1.0|I'm astounded by all the applause this book's been getting.  This book is well-written, but it lacks tension, humour, and anything resembling a plot.  The use of flashbacks to tell the story is ineffective and confusing.  It's also targeted for female readers since all the central characters are women.  This book might be categorized as a novel of manners, but that would be overgenerous and an insult to Jane Austen.

Normally I try to write balanced and analytic reviews, but this is THE GOONIES! So here's why the DVD is just so cool...<BR>One. The deleted scenes. Most of us, myself included, wanted to see the long-mooted Octopus scene, referred to by Data but never seen in the film. Well, it's here, along with some other stuff which you should like.<BR>Two. The Cyndi Lauper video. It's nearly 12 minutes long! I never saw it the first time around, and it's the cheesiest, corniest 80s pop video you'll ever see, complete with a few WWF wrestlers of the time (including Rowdy Roddy Piper!) and all of the kids except Kerry Green.<BR>Three. This is the best surprise of the whole lot. The commentary, listed as only featuring director Richard Donner, actually features ALL SEVEN of the kids together. And what's better, we SEE them. The commentary was recorded sometime around February 2001, and the whole thing was filmed. Let me tell you, it is SO cool to see the kids together, all grown up and reflecting on the making of the film with Richard Donner sitting in the middle like 'dad'. It's just great. And they all seem to be as excited as I was (although Sean Astin disappears halfway through for some reason!). But I can't recommend this enough.<BR>Just buy it, you'll see what I mean. Ah, what a classic movie.
B000021YQV|5.0|If you're one of the seemingly few who liked System of a Down's self-titled debut album, you're in luck, because they're back. And even if you didn't really like them then, give them another chance. Their music style has shifted somewhat. They've aged, and they've refined their old style by adding more harmony. And yet they seem to have done this while maintaining their down and dirty, hard feel. They have definitely evolved, and are certainly deserving of recognition. Look for them to be a sleeper hit.

B000002KHH|4.0|It was 1970. Nothing had changed, as the hippies hoped it had. The sweetness of Woodstock had been killed by Altamont.  The Left in the U.S. and U.K. was dissolving in confusion and anarchy. Genial, all-for-one rock bands had been replaced by ugly, egotistical Rock Stars. The Beatles broke up, and they broke up ugly.  Charles Manson was on trial and the hideous details of what he had done were being revealed every day on the news worldwide.  Nixon was in office, and Kent State showed that there were quite a few people who wanted the hippies dead.  The war was not only still going on, but getting worse; The My Lai Massacre occurred in 1970. The gentle drowsiness of pot and the mind expansion of LSD had been replaced by the nasty jitter of cocaine.  The dream, as Lennon announced, was over.<br />Into the void came Black Sabbath.  Their music had nothing to do with hippie idealism and everything to do with 1970 and its illness.  They were blunt, unrefined, and powerful.  There was also an emotionally scarred feeling to the music and lyrics.  They hoped for love and peace in the same way a drowning man going down for the third time hopes for a life raft.  And they sounded, overall, just plain evil.  They weren't, of course; in actuality they were just four guys from Birmingham, a run-down steel town in England with a lot of struggling middle-class people.  But they sounded evil, with Iommi's detuned guitar and his preference for slow-motion, ominous riffage, Bill Ward's heavy, but finessed drumming, and Geezer Butler's active, fist-hard bass.  And then there was Ozzy. &quot;First it was the bomb, napalm, vietnam, disillusioning,&quot; he sings in &quot;Hand of Doom,&quot; stating the whole theme of the &quot;Paranoid&quot; album.<br />This is an album about disillusion, disintegration, fear, and anger.  It's basically someone reacting to the world around them with shock, and retaliating the only way they know how; with music that reflects what's around them.  That is why &quot;Paranoid&quot; is one of the classic rock albums.  As long as the world remains a place where innocence is violated and dreams fall to ashes, &quot;Paranoid&quot; will express the feelings of those who watch in horror and feel the need to do something, anything, to exorcise their fear.  The War Pigs are still out there and they're still out for power.why &quot;Paranoid&quot; is one of the classic rock albums.

6300183211|2.0|I saw Brian DePalma's &quot;Scarface&quot; in a theater when I was a big fan of violent action movies.  &quot;Scarface&quot; is one of DePalma's very worst movies.<br />Cuban refugee Tony Montana(Al Pacino) becomes a drug dealer in Florida.  Montana rises to power as a cocaine kingpin but his success is only short-lived.<br />&quot;Scarface&quot; is Brian DePalma's second worst film after &quot;Raising Cain.&quot;  The viewers don't develop any real concern for Al Pacino's character.  In such masterpieces as &quot;Carrie&quot; and &quot;Dressed To Kill,&quot; DePalma brilliantly combined lurid sexual motifs with the graphic violence taking place in the films.  In &quot;Scarface,&quot; DePalma attempts to interweave themes regarding incest into the violent storyline but these efforts are hollow and heavy-handed.  DePalma's film is raunchy and crude to the point of being farcical.  The movie probably has more swearing than any film in the history of cinema.  As a crime film, &quot;Scarface&quot; has none of the decency and intelligence that is evident in the work of Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese.  One of the movie's few redeeming features is an AWESOME one-man-versus-an-entire-army action sequence towards the end of the film.<br />&quot;Scarface&quot; is nothing more than a foul-mouthed, trashy, and forgettable film.  The movie is only for diehard Al Pacino fans, people who merely want to see violent action, and those who feel that they need to see every Brian DePalma film.  For DePalma's best crime film, see &quot;The Untouchables.&quot;
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Every song on this album is uplifting.<br />You can hum along to most of them.<br />They all emphasize melody and Dylan's trademark voice twisting colloquial phrases into new permutations.<br />The theme seems to be the sound of the American back roads.<br />There is a blues base here, but Dylan's band really takes things in a variety of directions.<br />I almost gave this four stars though because of Bob's ridiculous moustache, but after a few listens, I am trying to sculpt a replica on my face.
B00004WIBW|3.0|I am not a particular fan of Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and most modern American movies.  I would never have rented &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; if I were not a big fan of British horror film actor Christopher Lee.  &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is a forgettable yet reasonably entertaining thriller.<br />In 1799, Constable Ichabod Crane(Johnny Depp) is sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders and bring the killer to justice.  While searching for the murderer, Crane encounters witchcraft and a headless horseman.<br />&quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is not much more than a passable time killer.  The film has a number of suspenseful moments.  The twist-ending is interesting yet fails to fully satisfy viewers; M. Night Shyamalan's &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and Robin Hardy's &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; had much more effective surprise-endings.  The performances are mostly wooden.  Christopher Lee's appearance as a judge only lasts for about a minute.  Christopher Walken perhaps gives the best performance in the entire film.  His savage portrayal of a Hessian mercenary is proof that acting is far more than merely reciting lines.  Walken has virtually no dialogue and has only several minutes of screen time but he exudes an absolutely terrifying presence.<br />&quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is only for fans of both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp and those who feel that they need to see all the films of Christopher Lee and Christopher Walken.
0060977493|5.0|There is a wonderful description of the beautiful land that is Kerala in India, and a provocative narrative style that is quite forceful.Yes, one has to be patient in absorbing the images as they form.The picturseque view of the verdant landscape of the village is enticing.<br />The story has to be painted in the canvas of your mind, to really enjoy the interwoven patterns of abstractions which children can conjure up and the prejudices of the adult society of India.<br />If you are looking for a book to read after say Equal Music by Vikram Seth, this could be the book for you.<br />As you start reading this book you are immersed in nostalgia,led back to those emotions and feelings of your childhood and the inner conflicts with the world built by the adults around you.<br />If Picasso was to review the book, he would have compared it to his famous work Guernica.
B000001E18|4.0|U2 leaped well ahead of their fan base with this experimental record that is a way out there vision of the world and society.<br />Numb was a hit, and is perhaps the most bizarre and yet hypnotic U2 song ever. Lemon sounds like a lemon tastes. I can't explain it if you haven't heard it. Zooropa and Babyface also have that futuristic quality about them, with lots of Bono singing in a high-pitched tone.<br />My favorite song on the album, actually, even though it doesn't really fit here, is The Wanderer, with Johnny Cash. I simply couldn't get enough of that track when I bought this.<br />Basically, this is a good album with several intriguing songs and certainly is a must for fans tracking the evolution of the band. But it doesn't have the emotional gut resonance for me that some of U2's most inspiring work does. <br />Enjoy!
0930289234|5.0|I've been reading comics since I was a kid (ok, I'm only 18 right now...) I stopped collecting because all the comic shops near me shut down. I recently bought Watchmen on ... here, and without a doubt, it is THE BEST comic I have ever read. There are no superheroic battles, rather gritty, down to Earth crimes and crimesolving. The alternate history timeline is simply the finest writing I've ever seen in a comic. I've heard so much about Watchmen before, I finally broke down and bought it to see what the hoopla is all about. Thank goodness I did. This is a comic that justifies the medium. When someone says \\"you read comics?!\\" in disgust, show them this, or better yet, make them read it, and they'll have an appreciation for the art. Simply timeless and amazing.
B000003BDJ|5.0|Get your ya-yas out with the best two-disc music collection on the planet. Hot Rocks is chock-full of timeless Stones' classics -- I don't need to repeat them here -- and is a must for any serious Rock collection. The entire album is a staple of Rock radio, and it thoroughly documents the Stones' fusion of blues rhythms with Rock guitar and Mick Jagger's dynamic lyrics and voice.<br />You want the essence of the Rock and Roll? Buy this album!<br />(Even if you are a purist and want all of their individual albums, Hot Rocks is still great when you want their hits in one place, i.e. in your car).<br />Enjoy!
0446605409|2.0|Somehow this book ended up on my bookshelf, and as I was desperate for something to read on a trip, I gave it a go. The story itself was fairly interesting and well-done; in fact, it kept me reading (barely) despite my extreme dislike of the main character, John Corey. Corey's arrogance, chauvinism, and often inappropriate wisecracking was quite tiresome and even offensive on several occasions. The character himself admits to all these faults, but that does not make them any easier to bear nor does it excuse them. I also disliked much of Corey's behavior, and I was appalled by his treatment of the villain in the climax. Violence and other destructive acts certainly have their place in novels as integral elements of a story or character, but in this case I did not find Corey's behavior at all motivated or justified. Frankly, I find it disturbing that a character like this is seen as a &quot;hero&quot;.
B000002MY3|5.0|Wow. A pop album, in fact one of the most popular albums of all time, without a single derivative lyric! This is the most amazing, original album about lost love and twenty-something angst ever. Alanis's screechy vocals pounds the point into our heads...<br />Not only does Jagged Little Pill have some of the best songs of all time, it also has some of the best lines ever...<BR>Here's a few of my favorites from You Oughta Know:<BR>&quot;And every time you speak her name does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died, until you died, but you're still alive!&quot;<BR>&quot;It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me&quot;<br />And it's not all downers...&quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot; shows Alanis moving on, not knowing what's coming next but looking forward to what's next in her life.<br />As far as Alanis's voice not having the technical power of, say, Whitney Houston, I say, thank God! These are songs that aren't meant to sound pretty, for Pete's sake!<br />A terrific album.<br />Enjoy!
B00003CXP1|5.0|it is really a shame that Traffic, while a very good film, received so much attention and this one, a far superior film, recieved so little. the direction, score, and editing define the best qualities of independent film and the performances, especially Ms Byrstyn and Mr Leto, are spellbinding. remember to breathe in the last fifteen minutes, i almost forgot. this film so brilliantly depicts the downward spiral of addiction that you wont be able to take your eyes off of it until the last credit rolls
B000002H92|5.0|One of the best live albums of all time, The Doors In Concert puts you there with all the humor, asides and energy that you get at a live concert, starting with the House Announcer.<br />The performances themselves transcend the typical rock concert, approaching a sort of mystical musical nirvana, where the band and the audience are caught up in a completely surreal experience. Jim Morrison's mesmerizing voice and lyrics and band's unique sound envelop you and transport you to another place and time. While you may have many of the same songs on other CDs (such as The Best of the Doors), they take on a different quality here. The performances are more uneven, as you would expect with a live CD, but they have more passion and paint more of a picture...You can just imagine the sweat pouring off of Morrison, or the crazed women screaming... <br />All of the complainers here who don't want The End to be 15 minutes long can go listen to the studio version if it makes you happy...I usually listen to this, because somehow it feels more -- Real.<br />Enjoy!
B000002KIE|5.0|Despite what some pretentious &quot;rock snobs&quot; say about The Sex Pistols, the Pistols were alsolutely the best punk band ever to come out of Britain. The raw energy of Nevermind the Bollocks never fails to offend squares, even today, which I find hilarious. Along with The Stooges, The Velvet Underground, Bad Brains and Minor Threat, the Sex Pistols rank as one of the best and rawest bands in history.
B00004SCX6|3.0|Anybody who can take something titled &quot;Oops&quot; to number 1 has to be doing something right. Sure, she's insipid. Sure, her voice isn't all that (neither is Madonna's). Sure, she's showing a whole new generation how to make money by acting like a tramp. But let's face it, she's the best-marketed product of the new millenium, and you've got to give credit where credit is due.<br />I only wish she'd actually sing her songs at awards shows, or at least lip-sync better while she has that snake around her neck. (I know, that's asking a lot!)

Mel poped the question one day while Duffy watching TV and though he think she is the one, he hesitated a little and eventually agree,however a trip to the IKEA everything turned sour because Mel know him too well that he is afraid of commitments.

Eventually his relealisation and personal growth overcome his fear and embark to a quest to win Mel back.<br />Following through the roller coaster thoughts and actions of Duffy. The novel is a page turner and Mike Gayle wrote with hypersensitivity and very heart-warming details.Filled with intellectual interests and physiologically humours. With many laugh out moments and sometimes caused awe and most of all realistically truthful and insightful from a male point of view. A vivid confession.
0375704027|3.0|Maybe it's the translation that was weak but having read Sputnik Sweetheart, Norwegian Wood seems immature. I've read that this book was written early in Murakami's career but published after his other works and he himself did not want this book widely distributed outside of Japan so maybe he felt the same way.<br />Some of the dialogue felt so set up and sometimes downright silly. You could almost hear the author thinking, &quot;now here is where I make him seem really deep&quot; or &quot;this will make her seem tragic.&quot;  <br />On the other hand, I really enjoyed the descriptions of dorm life and everyday activities. When the main charcater was alone, it all flowed nicely. Whenever dialogue was involved, it often seemed contrived.<br />I hope I don't offend anyone with this mediocre rating especially amongst all the 5 star ratings. I do like Murakami's writing though and am looking forward to his Wind up Bird Chronicle.
B00005LKIM|5.0|I loved SILENCE OF THE LAMBS &amp; when I read the book of HANNIBAL a while back I started pining for the movie release. HANNIBAL surpasses its predecessor in terms of panache &amp; graphic gore. Anyone expecting Oscar material will be disappointed (&amp; nauseated) with this, but I loved it. Lecter is relatively &quot;normal&quot; in this movie, which I feel makes him all the more terrifying. The plot revolves around one of Lecter's surviving victims, Mason Verger (the always excellent Gary Oldman, in gruesome makeup) plotting to capture Hannibal &amp; feed him to his carnivorous wild pigs, as payment to Lecter feeding his face to a pack of dogs. When Clarice Starling (Juliannne Moore) learns of this she sets out to warn Lecter. Ridley Scott scores another bullseye after his success with GLADIATOR. His expected visual style complements Hopkins' performance well.  Moore meanwhile, manages to step into the role of Starling and make it her own. My only quibble is that Oldman had his name removed from the credits supposedly because he wanted second billing.And for you gorehounds there are several gruesome scenes to savor, including Hopkins introducing Ray Liotta to the pleasures of &quot;brain food&quot;. Yum.

B0000047CW|5.0|This is probably the best - if not - the most important and significant Jazz album that I have and will probably ever own, hands down. It was the first CD I ever owned and still in my top 10 list of *all* time. Getz is one of the key contributors to introducing the American public to the nuances, soul, and sensuality of Brazilian-influenced jazz back in the early 60s. &quot;Desifinado&quot; is a punchy, playful tune that takes the listener upon a delight samba dance. &quot;Samba Triste&quot; is sad, and soulful so much so that you can hear the tenor sax lightly crying in Getz's hands. In all tracks, Getz and Byrd take the listener to a point of jazz-induced highs, lows, and in-betweens only to gently pull you back and forth a few more times before slowly ending each dance so you feel complete. If you have never tasted the richness of South American influenced Jazz this is probably the best place to start. Dinner is served and with Getz/Byrd as your chefs be prepared to experience a sensuous and filling 5 course meal. Bottoms up!<BR>Moving in Stereo - d.i.roberts
B00005O5CM|4.0|Legally Blonde is a great movie with lots of laughs and a bit of mystery. Lawyers will probably like it. It stars Reeese Witherspoon as a popular, pretty blonde named Elle who wants to become Mrs. Warner Huntington III, but when the cool and rich Warner (Matthew Davis) dumps her to go to Harvard Law, Elle decides to go too and becomes one heck of a lawyer helping out her hairdresser friend (Jennifer Coolidge), solving a mystery that involves an old friend of her's (Ali Larter) and finding the man she really loves (Luke Wilson). But will Elle find out why her professor (Victor Garber) acts nice to her, or that Warner has another girlfriend (Selma Blair)? Watch this awesome movie to find out if Elle graduates from Harvard Law.
B00005NKCM|1.0|I eagerly awaited these, as I really enjoyed the series years ago. The series was wonderful, but I was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD's.  Some are black and white, but my black and white copies showed little explosions of green and red.  The sound faded, and was difficult to hear at times.  In one of the episodes the figures glowed with an eerie green.  I am normally very happy with the quality of A&amp;E DVD's, so the poor quality was a surprise.
B000021XS0|2.0|ok, for the guys who think jordan rudess is better than derek s. an kevin moore:he is not. he's a gerat virtuoso palyer, but he lacks any real inspiration. at least on this album. many of the tracks are boring, and they lacks that incredible power and inventive that you can hear on images and words and on awake. moreover I liked derek work on FII and on once in a live time much more. his mixture &quot;jazz/progressive&quot;kind of playing gave a great power to DT. talking about the tracks, overture 1928 and strange deja-vu are great, home is OK, though is unnecessary long, I like some parts of byond this life.<BR>I won't spend any words on the spirit...and on trhough her heys...while the last track has a great arrangment work on it, but on different albums DT did teach  us that when a song is 12 minutes long there's a reason, here there is not. let's hope for the next album...
B00005JKES|5.0|The best show that ever has and ever will be on television!<BR>Great music, great characters, and beautifully photographed. Death to James, though. The beauty pagant and Nadine's return to high school were definitely Jump the Shark moments. That said, I am in agreement with the previous posters that it is about time that this nevertheless brilliant show is on DVD. I don't even have a DVD player yet and I ordered it! I still have all my tapes from when I recorded it a decade ago but they are starting to fade and the commercials are aggravating (though the news briefs of the escalation to Desert Storm are somewhat interesting. Oops, tangent.) Is the pilot truly on this collection? At the time of posting the Amazon page is lacking information, though officially the pilot episode is known as The Pilot, with the next episode known as Episode One, etc... In various research I read that Artisan does not have the rights to the pilot; except for that weird European one that has an &quot;ending.&quot; (In case the network never picked it up.) And that the network pilot belongs to Warner Bros.and that only if this makes money will they release it. More a rant than a review except to say I must love it cause I want the rest on DVD! C'mon everyone; buy it! Buy it right now. You will not be disappointed.<BR>If only HBO was doing weekly series in 1990!
B00001W9G0|5.0|A classic romance, THE WAY WE WERE has never looked or sounded better. After years of fuzzy, washed-out prints on video, the long-awaited DVD release of this masterpiece has been worth the wait.<br />Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford lead the cast as Katie and Hubble, two mismatched lovers who deeply care for each other, but have irreconcilable differences that tear them apart.<br />Among the strong supporting cast are Allyn Ann McLerie (CALAMITY JANE), Lois Chiles, Herb Edelman, Bradford Dillman, Viveca Lindfors, and Murray Hamilton.<br />The DVD includes commentary by director Sydney Pollack, documentary featuring interviews with Pollack, Streisand, screenwriter Arthur Laurents and composer Marvin Hamlisch, and the original trailer.
0792153189|3.0|Of the two asteroid disaster movies that were released, it is really hard to tell who is the winner.     Armageadon had nonstop Yeah-right action, but also had a somewhat good charachters and story. Deep Impact, however, tries to convey a sense of doom and destruction rather then blown out action. It only succeds in the latter part.     The movie starts out interestingly enough. A ameatur astronamer sees a really big rock heading for earth and the planet plunges into peril. For the rest of the movie, we witness society collpse, panic and more panic. Twords the end of the film, you really dont care what happens to the poor innocent people that will surley die. For me, the best part of the movie occours near the very end of the film. That is when the smaller asteroid hits earth and causes a huge tidal wave that wipes out 50% of the planet. The 4 minute tidal wave sequence is worth waiting through over an hour of boring story to witness. Its increadible to witness new york get engulfed in the tidal wave and several other cities.     Overall, Deep Impact succeds at the short action sequences and not really in the people section.    The Good: The spectacular tidal wave sequence, all the panic is interesting to watch, mildly good \\"Were all going to die\\" Additude    The bad: Little action    And the ugly: gets boring after 15 minutes
B00003CXXS|1.0|Horrific !! Why wasted such good material with bad, stupid script and bad editing ?? Even an A list cast would not be able to save this very bad piece of work !! I seriously looking forward to the director's comment in the DVD on how and why did he made this terrible film.
0451526295|5.0|&quot;Mansfield Park&quot; has always been Jane Austen's most controversial novel.<br />The heroine of the book is Fanny Price, a powerless and socially marginal young woman. To almost everyone she knows, she barely exists. As a child, she is sent to live with the family of her wealthy uncle. Her parents give her up without regret, and her uncle only takes her in because he is deceived into doing so. Fanny's wealthy relations, when they deign to notice her at all, generally do so only to make sure she knows of her inferiority and keeps in her place. Fanny is thus almost completely alone, the only kindness she receives coming from her cousin Edmund. Forced by circumstances to be an observer, Fanny is a faultlessly acute one, as well as the owner of a moral compass that always points true north.<br />Those who dislike &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; almost invariably cite Fanny as the novel's central fault. She is generally accused of being two things: (1) too passive, and (2) too moral.<br />The charge of passivity is perplexing. Surely it is evident that for her to challenge those in power over her is extremely dangerous - in fact, when she finally does challenge them, on a matter of the greatest importance to her and of next to no importance to them, she is swiftly reminded of the weakness of her situation by being deported back to the impoverished family of her parents, who receive her with indifference.<br />The charge of morality is easier to understand - many readers feel themselves being silently accused by Fanny, and they don't like it. The interesting thing is that those same readers often enjoy &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, even though it is evident that the same moral standards are in place in both books. So, why do readers feel the prick of criticism in one and not the other?<br />Part of the answer is that in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; the stakes are higher, which squeezes out the levity of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, can afford to smile at the follies of others - they are not dangerous to her (at least she thinks not - she comes to think differently before the book is over). Fanny, however, can seldom afford to laugh. Vices that are funny in the powerless can be frightening in the powerful. Fanny's vulnerability to the faults of others is clear to her, and she suffers for it throughout &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;.<br />Another part of the answer is that attractions that are combined in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; are split in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;. In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, Mr. Darcy is both rich and good; in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, Henry Crawford is only rich. In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, Elizabeth Bennet is both witty and good; in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, Fanny Price is only good. Readers who liked &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; because it had a rich man attracted to a witty woman, will either find nothing in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; to engage their enthusiasms, or, as is not uncommon, they will actually find themselves drawn to the book's sometimes-antagonists, the Crawfords.<br />Having dealt with why some people dislike &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, it remains to deal with why other people like it. Its central attraction is the skillful blending of the story of Fanny Price herself, which is the Jane Austen's adaptation of the &quot;Cinderella&quot; archetype, and the story of the other characters, which are of the great Christian themes of fall and redemption.<br />&quot;Cinderella&quot;, is of course the story of hope for the powerless. It has been subject to a certain amount of well-intended misreading in recent decades, but the motive for that misreading really concerns an accident of the eponymous story - the sex of the main character - rather than its real theme, which is universal. &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, for example, shows how easily and successfully the Cinderella archetype can be applied to a maleprotagonist.<br />Fall and redemption is the other story of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;. At the start, the characters other than Fanny are fallen or falling. Some are so corrupt that we are have no hope for them; their presence is purely malign, endangering those not so badly off as themselves. Others have fallen far, but are not quite so far gone that we do not have hope for them as well as fear of them. Finally, there are those who are only beginning to fall, whose danger is all the more alarming for it.<br />In &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, these stories are not just side by side, they are interwoven. Jane Austen's Cinderella saves not only herself, but also saves - and almost saves - others as well. All but the worst characters in the book are drawn to the goodness in Fanny, even while they yield to the temptations that threaten them. The book has real tension in that we don't know who will make it and who will not. Those who feel sympathy for the Crawfords are not entirely misreading the story - we are not wrong when we sympathize with a drowning man clutching at a rope thrown to him. Where we can go wrong is not when we wish not for the drowning man to be pulled to shore, but when we wish for the person at the other end of the rope to be pulled in after him.
B00000K0DT|5.0|This is one of the best movies of its type that I have ever seen. It is a modern classic in my opinion. I have never heard of anyone who didn't like it, buy it, you won't be sorry.
B00005NZBN|5.0|Why, yes, it is.  Dylan has given us a golden album.  It's mix of blues, jazz, rockabilly, and bluegrass that shows Dylan at his finest.  Well done Bob.  He just gets better and better.

B00000HYXB|5.0|This is my second Blind Guardian album (&quot;Somewhere Far Beyond&quot; was the first), and each one I buy seems to bring me new levels of amazement.  SFB was great, but this one is brilliance far beyond (no pun intended) that album.  It's pretty different from anything the band has done before.  It's not as consistently fast and hard as previous albums (although there is plenty of that), and there seems to be more melodic hooks, reminiscent of early Iron Maiden.  There's also a keyboardist this time around, giving it a neo-classical, almost Dream Theater-ish sound.  Basically, the music is unbelievably great.  &quot;Nightfall&quot;, &quot;Blood Tears&quot;, &quot;Thorn&quot;, and &quot;Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)&quot; will blow you away.  I hate to whip out the cliches here, but they do apply.  This is a concept album, based on JRR Tolkien's &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;.  There are several brief narrations along the way, that sort of aid you in following the story.  This is especially helpful if you've never read the book.  I haven't read any of the Hobbit series at this time, so I was completely lost.  I will read the books sometime in the near future, as it sounds like a very bizarre and interesting story.  I recommend this album to metal fans and Hobbit fans alike.  Even if you've heard all of BG's previous releases, you have no idea what to expect here.  If you haven't heard the band at all, you're really in for a surprise.  I'd say this is probably their best album, and one of the best albums ever made.  You just can't go wrong here.
B00000255F|5.0|In 1975,the then 26 year old Bruce Springsteen was on the brink of being dropped from Colombia Records. Despite the cult following he had established on the east coast through his spectacular live shows, his first two albums had sold virtually nothing and the company had basically given up on their \\"New Dylan\\". Mike Appel had to beg a CBS executive to lend him the money to get recording underway for Springsteen's third album. When it did get underway Springsteen told Appel and new buddy Jon Landua his vision for the record. A hybrid mesh of Phil Spector's wall of sound and the lyrical fantastics of Dylan combined with his own vision of American youth. The result was \\"Born to Run\\" , a record that simultaneously saved Springsteen's career and marked him as Americas musical saviour. Though Springsteen would not really find commercial success until \\" The River\\", \\"Born to Run\\" and the media hype that followed it sent Springsteen waves reverberating across the country. A decade later upon the release of \\" Born in the USA\\" those waves would engulf the planet. \\"Born to Run\\" is a landmark record for a variety of reasons with Springsteen's song writing reaching a place that he has not really visited since. Tracks such as \\"Thunder Road\\" and \\"Backstreets\\" are not simply superb rock songs but brilliant compositions. A blending of daring poetry and snarling guitar, of love and longing, of triumph and betrayal. Others such as \\" Meeting Across the River\\" and \\" Jungleland\\" with their themes of gangs and small time hustlers could be played out on Broadway such is the power of the images they evoke. The musicianship is flawless with grand guitar and saxophone solos set amidst the lull of heartbreaking piano brought together seamlessly through some of the most ambitious production in the history of rock. It is truly the most exhilarating , most complex recording of Springsteen's distinguished career. However the true greatness of \\"Born to Run\\" somehow lies beyond the music in a tingling of the senses that cannot be explained only compared. It is the promise of Whitman, Twain, Presley, Dean, Cash and Dylan fused into an 8 track record. It is sticking your head out of a window of your car at 100mph on a highway any where on this planet and screaming into the wind. It is the young kid from the wrong side of the bridge who had no chance of making good but through sheer want and will, did so any way.g of the senses that cannot be explained only compared.

B00000BKDX|5.0|As a live album, this is truly monumental.  I'd say that outside of Iced Earth's &quot;Alive in Athens&quot; (the GOD of live albums), and possibly Ozzy's &quot;Live and Loud&quot;, this is the best live album ever made.  And, one listen will tell you why.  Just about all of Iron Maiden's best songs (at least, all the ones up to '85) can be found here.  All of them sound at least as good as the original recordings, which is something you don't often get in a live album.  Even Metallica and Slayer can't recreate their recordings.  Bruce's vocals are top tier, and every instrument is audible and right on the mark.  The best moments have got to be &quot;Powerslave&quot;, &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, and &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot;, which all somehow manage to sound even better than when they were first recorded.  This may be because they were played a little faster, but I don't know.  The part where Bruce is trying to get the crowd going on &quot;Running Free&quot; is really funny too.  Everything sounds great here.  &quot;Powerslave&quot; and &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; are well represented, the Paul DiAnno stuff is greatly improved (Paul's not a bad vocalist, but Bruce is far superior), and there are some scorching tracks from &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;. I don't have that album yet, and I'm now wondering why so many people didn't think much of it.  &quot;The Trooper&quot; and &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot; are killer tracks, and &quot;Revelations&quot; really hits hard.  All in all, this is a great live album from one of the best bands of all time.  My only complaints are that it's not very long for a double album (Disc 2 is less than 30 minutes in length), and their two best albums (&quot;Brave New World&quot; and &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;) had yet to be unleashed upon the world, so sadly they were not represented here.  If they put out a live album from the BNW tour, it could likely be even better than this (so long as there isn't too much of their '90's stuff), but until then, buy this.  UP THE IRONS!!!!their '90's stuff), but until then, buy this.  UP THE IRONS!!!!
B00000K2SC|2.0|I know hardcore sci-fi fans will probably be upset by this. The Matrix isn't a great movie. It's a cool looking movie with great effects and everything. I found the movie to be very hard and uninteresting to get into. It's not an easy movie to like. Keanu Reeves is his usual bland, wooden self. He doesn't do anything new here. I just think the film could've been a little more entertaining. I know die hard sci-fi fans will hate me for this, but this just isn't interesting enough to get into. Hard to watch.
B00005KHJT|4.0|Halloween is Best horror movie ever made. The addition of extra and deleted scenes in this dvd make it the definitive and more complete version.

B00003CXTF|1.0|Pearl Harbor tried so hard to be a monumental film classic along the lines of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;. It fails horribly. Everybody knows the history of Pearl Harbor, so, no need to get into it. The effects in this film are wonderful, of course, but that's the only thing to reccommend. The actors are pretty good. Josh Hartnett is definitley a big star in the making. Jon Voight, as the President, was wonderful. The movie drags on too long with nothing happening. They want so desperatley to have that special romantic magic llike in &quot;Titanic&quot;, but they have no clue on how to go about doing that. It's just bad. The heroes and survivors of Pearl Harbor deserved better than this. It's obvious that they are trying so hard for a memorable film. They fail horribly. It seems that the rave reviews for this movie are by girls who probably just have the hots for Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. A major overblown turkey in every way possible. This movie will make you appreciate &quot;Titanic&quot; even more after seeing this travesty.

6302824613|5.0|This is a bloody disaster of a film.  Incoherent, nothing fits together, obviously stapled together from the usable bits that remained after the truly disastrous stuff was tossed.  As a movie, it really doesn't work.  <br />But taken as a collection of skits, it's a treasure.  The cast is spectacular, the writing shows moments of acid-induced genius, and then there's that soundtrack.<br />If you think of it as a Bond-themed Monty Python episode, you won't be too far off the mark.
B00005QATY|4.0|this movie is very inventive, and has new and different entertaining characterizations. putting handsome george clooney as the lead shows that he can poke fun at his gorgeous george image.
B00003CXFV|5.0|I loved Julia Roberts in this role!  it was refreshing to see her play a different type of charachter, in this case based on a real life person! This is such a heart felt, touching story because of the work that Erin and Ed did to make such a difference to so many people.  Things like this happen all the time, unfortunately, and all too often there is no one to help them.  This is the story of how you really can make a difference, not saying it is easy, but it is possible! It also portrays life on the inside for this single mother and is honest in the hardships which are sometimes faced in our lives. Very good movie- one to watch again &amp; again- don't delay, buy it today!
0345440757|5.0|I found this book very helpful.  The first three months of my sons life was wonderful, however was also full of frustrating and confusing times.  After reading Tracy's book my Son became a much more joyful baby.  No longer as fussy as he used to be and at many times unconsulable; more so due to my inability to interpret his needs more accurately.  He thrives on a routine which we made together with the advice from Tracy.  My confidence developed and still is developing as we utilize her words of wisdom concerning the livelyhood and tender care of infants. Our son was our bundle of joy at birth and continues to bloom and thrive. All are happier in our household and more able to enjoy every moment.  Tracy's style as an author is enlightening.  It was a very quick read and a pleasure as well.  I would share this book with anyone, first time mom or not.  Much thanks Tracy!
B00005N9CV|5.0|Diana Krall has her own sound, certainly, and it is never more lush than it is on 'The Look of Love.' With a breathy, sometimes smoky voice, she evokes New York City lounges where you dressed up and drank martinis, much more so than the many retro acts out there now. <BR>She sings standards on this album and her interpretations are simply wonderful. The first song, 'S'Wonderful' is indeed that. There is bossa nova along with the usual ballads, and of course the players are top notch. Dancing in the Dark, Love Letters, and so on. <BR>Really a fine album.
B000001FY9|5.0|Relaxing and down to earth music. A nice change from our fake, plastic, capitalist society.
B00000JQFM|5.0|I can still remember my first year at a local community college in 1988 when a friend bought this CD and we started listening to it, although I had no idea who Joe Satriani was. The smoking title track had me hooked immediately and it didn't take long to realize what a talent this guy was. The entire album is strong but my personal favorites include &quot;Ice 9&quot;, &quot;Circles&quot;, &quot;Lords of Karma&quot;, and &quot;Echo&quot;. Joe never made another album again that sounds like this one. That's a great thing about him. The amazing thing is that all of his albums are great. Start with this one, the way I did.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is the best.  I loved Harry Potter, the Chrestomanci books, Tamora Pierce's Circle of Magic, the Circle Opens, and the Immortals, The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife as well as the Animorph books, Broken Sky, and So You Want to Be A Wizard.  All of them were beyond excellent, and 'Sabriel' was amazing.<br />  From the characters to the history of the world and the structure of magic, this book is as good as it gets.  It's an action packed fun read--and it's not overly full with romantic stuff.  The book is very balanced, and you'll find yourself wanting to keep reading, even after you finished that book, to the sequel 'Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr' and the upcoming 'Abhorsen' ! A wonderful book!
B00005N9CV|2.0|I heard her in concert a few months ago. She was great. Where have the hard driving piano improvs and innovative swinging vocals gone? 'The Look of Love' is very little jazz (mostly pop) with maple syrup poured all over it. I hope it didn't ruin my CD player!
B00005N9CV|5.0|After what seemed to be an eternity, the new album was released today, and I have not turned it off since the disc started spinning...  Diana's voice just improves with age!  Besame Mucho is tops on the lineup, and the final track, Maybe You'll Be There is a great way to wrap the disc...  Highly recommended for all fans!  Back to the music!!!
B00000K19E|4.0|The Actors in The Matrix took overacting to the extreme. Instead of playing their characters the way they should be played, they pretended to be all gloomy and dark, screwing up their lines, making them sound forced.However, the rest of the movie more than makes up for it, with Awesome fight scenes, Exellent visual effects, and a great ending sequence. All in all, 4 stars.
B000002GJH|5.0|With the passing of Andrew Wood(lead singer Mother Love Bone), roomate Chris Cornell(Soundgarden) and band members Jeff Ament(Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam) and Stone Gossard(Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam) wrote a colaboration of songs outpouring their deepest emotions. This albumn is the purest most musical form of mourning(and we all know what kind of impact raw emotion has on music). Definately a must have for any Pearl Jam or Soundgarden fan. Additional lead guitars by Mike McCready(Pearl Jam); Drums, Matt Cameron(Soundgarden, Pearl Jam); Additional voice, Eddie Vedder(Pearl Jam). Contains hit singles, Say Hello 2 Heaven, Reach Down and Hunger Strike. If you say you love grunge and don't get this albumn, you don't love and appreciate grunge. If you like this albumn, check out Ten(Pearl Jam), Vs.(Pearl Jam) and Superunknown(Soundgarden)

B00004BZ0N|5.0|Great Album. They are just as good as Rancid. Punk YAYAYAYAYA
B0000029J5|5.0|There are very few performers who can handle as many diverse styles and genres as adeptly as Keb' Mo'. He does folk. He does blues, He does funk. He does R&amp;B. He seems to do whatever takes his fancy and he does it so well. This CD is fun to listen to, stylishly done and moving. I loved it. After two days I went back to Amazon and ordered &quot;The Door&quot; which is equally wonderful.
B000056N8X|3.0|The problem with the Highlander films stem from the fact the original was written to stand alone without sequels. How hard is it to grasp that Connor wins The Prize, the end ? Very difficult, I imagine, when you start seeing the dollar signs. <BR> It may have been possible back in 1987, if original writer Gregory Widen had been able to compose a decent sequel with a generous  budget.  Instead he and the producers rushed out what qualifies as the worst sequel since Caddyshack 2.<BR>  Lambert was in the right movie at the right time, back in 1986, when Highlander was filmed. He is NOT a good actor by any means, but everyone has one role they are born to play. Connor Macleod is Lamberts one role.  If you disagree simply look up the films Lambert was in prior to Highlander, and the putrid slop he has done since.   <BR> Be that as it may, we are left with H:Endgame, a fair sequel making more use of the mediocre t.v. series than Christopher Lambert's character.<BR>  In H:ENDGAME, Lambert is looking as old and tired as his character is portrayed to be. I'll add he's probably a bit bitter that this science fiction role hasn't translated into more mainstream success and that obsessive fans at conventions keep screaming for him to do 'one more Highlander film'!! (It's been 15 years, people!!)<BR>  They've gone back and 'inserted' a villian where none existed before, though the concept of how the village dealt with Connor's mother was a interesting addition to the mythology. Obvious, in terms of where and how the current villian came about, but interesting nonetheless. <BR>   They brought back Beatie Edney (wonder what she got paid for this cameo?) and Shelia Gish to try and give this sequel some of the feel of the original and fail miserably.<BR>  They wrote themselves into a corner with the first film, and all sequels and series since have suffered from it. There has never been an adequate explanation of what exactly the immortals are or why their immortal. That's ok, sinceit adds to the mystique of the films, but it makes for difficult scripting.<BR>  In any reality other than this film, Duncan Macleod would've gotten obliterated by Connor Macleod. Connor has 400 years on him if you believe the website chronology, but alas, Lambert is sick to death of being associated with the series.  We hear he actually asked to have his character be summarily 'dismissed'. <BR>   Sean Connery added much more to the original film than the producers ever realized. Poor Sean, they really did his character a disservice by bringing him back in the second film.  But, since they have no respect for the fans or the actors, shouldn't they have tried harder to bring him back for H:ENDGAME ?<BR>  I will add the fight scenes are well-choreographed but, how difficult would it have been to add some matrix style sequences ? Just one way to add something new to the beheading scenes.<BR>  To summarize, they could've done worse. Then again, they set the bar for worse with Highlander 2, renegade version or no renegade version.  Still, they've cheated the true fans by introducing these worthless characters played by hack actors. They could've just brought Mario Van Peebles back from the dead in my opinion.  They never did go far enough with that whole Lord of Illusions storyline. That could've made for a fantastic sequel.<BR>   I'm holding out for a DVD of the 118 minute eruopean version of the original. You should, too.
B000002LIX|5.0|I first had Ritual de lo Habitual on tape about nine years ago. I listened to it habitually (sorry). I was so proud of my new Alpine car stereo system I got a decibel-meter and cranked this Jane's CD to a peak of 110 decibels. That was the volume of choice for this CD. <br />Of course, Been Caught Stealing caught my immediate attention. Excellent bass groove, compelling, excellent song. We probably all agree, because it's been vastly overplayed.<br />Then, nine years ago, I would listen to the first five songs and stop--except I also enjoyed the morphed Irish beer drinking song &quot;Of Course&quot;. The first five songs meld into an exulting stream of driving, bass guitar punctuated musical bliss. I would listen, rewind impatiently, and listen again.<br />Then, a few years later, I got the CD. I listened to the same old songs again, glossing over Three Days and Then She Did. They weren't as immediately listenable as the first five. My senior year of college, though, that changed. One day I realized that I'd missed those two songs, and I rediscovered the CD. Then I listened to those two songs with utter fascination. That was five years ago. I still play them often, and I still love them.<br />Of all the music I own, I wrote a review particularly for this CD because it has been tested through ten years of listening and I can confidently opine that it is one of my top five ever. Utterly outstanding--but I must add that I skip over &quot;Been Caught Stealing&quot; most times. Don't buy this just for that song or you'll be disappointed; buy this song if you like the best of the music from the genre formerly know as alternative.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Finally after many months of waiting, the latest DIANA KRALL album &quot;The Look of Love&quot; was finally released here. This work of art by Ms Krall is absolutely fantastic. The selection of songs is great, arrangements by Claus Ogerman are first class, but above all the sultry voice of Diana Krall is out of this world.<BR>  How she sings the opening tune  &quot;`S Wonderful&quot; is surely the keyword for the rest of the songs. Her renditions of &quot;Cry Me A River&quot;, &quot;Besame Mucho&quot; in Spanish or &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot; are simply breathtaking. She deserves any music award there is.
B0000025T6|5.0|&quot;Nebraska&quot; contains part of a multi-day recording session in Colt's Neck, New Jersey, during which Springsteen cut demos of new songs he had recently written, including many tunes which would later appear on his &quot;Born In The USA&quot; CD. He tried recording these tunes with the E Street band, deciding to release the original demo tape instead, and with good reason.<BR>With his songwriting skills honed to a harrowing edge on this CD, the ambience of &quot;Nebraska&quot; is as chilling as the characters in his shadowy vignettes and their motives, be it revenge, redemption, or just trying to get ahead. (If you listen close, you can hear a chair squeaking on one track.)<BR>This music is not for the faint of heart. Springsteen's howling harmonica, vocal echo, squeaking furniture, and first-person point-of-view tales of the indolent make for a frightening  journey into the minds of his anti-heroes, making this CD one of the most convincing 'mocumentaries' of Americana ever waxed. <BR>The tantalizing possibility of the existance of the Complete Colt's Neck Session CD would cause many a fan a sleepless night.

B00003W8NM|5.0|Brad Pitt is proving himself to be the James Dean of our generation. After such brilliant roles as Jeffrey Goines (Twelve Monkeys) and David Mills (SE7EN), Pitt has reached a pinnacle in his role as Tyler Durden. Coming from the brilliant mind of satirist Chuck Palahniuk, Tyler could not be seen as portrayed by any other contemporary actor. The mannerisms, speeches and action of Durden are so well articulated by Pitt, that we often loose focus on the protagonist of the film, portrayed by Ed Norton (American History X). The catalyst that ties the whole movie together is the director, David Fincher (also of SE7EN). His work ethic of perfection pays of greatly in the end product of this film. Says Palahniuk in the DVD commentary (paraphrased, since I dont have time to go back and transcribe it)'After seeing the end product, I was ashamed of the novel I wrote'. In an era where modern literature is ... and disfigured in the filmmaking process, this is a telling comment on Fincher's professionalism. I eagerly await his future releases, Panic Room, Seared, and (possibly) Rendezvous with Rama.<BR>This is definitely a DVD worth owning, with two discs, containing four commentary tracks, trailers and BTS; you will easily become a Fincher-Palahniuk disciple as well
B00000IQUT|3.0|This movie was tough to watch, and I am rarely offended by movies. The characters are so vile and there is so much violence in this movie, I would genuinely worry if people took it lightly. On the other hand, it is so violent and graffic, it exposes you to that side of life that is far too real, unfortunately. Having known victims of violence, I can relate to them much better now than before, and I am glad that a movie can helped me on this point without having to go through it myself.<br />The plot lacks a bit,, and the characters aren't delved into with much energy. However, there is enough there to help you through the horror scenes. So if you can deal with being depressed, and you just want to test yourself, this movie may not be a bad idea.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is one of the best Acustic Folk-Rockers out there right now.  It has a beat to it that is mellow but great.  Perfect for chilling or if you're just in a bad mood.  If you like this, I reccomend Peter Stuart (and his band Dog's Eye View) or Rockwell Church.
B00004W5UA|5.0|This movie is nothing you would think it is about. I rented it with a very skeptical mind, and I came away astounded. I'm not suprised that women haven't liked this movie very much, and I've concluded it is generally a movie for guys. It focuses on a turning point all men face, the transistion from early twenties to adulthood. In our culture, we often neglect questions of identity, and we typically indulge in consumerism as Ed Norton's character does in the beginning. Then comes along Tyler Dirden (Brad Pitt) who challenges Norton's life. Implicit in this is a string of doubts: I was a boy, then a teen, then young, now a man, and that means? where did that go? why did it go? It is like a midlife crisis 10 or 15 years too soon. This movie tries to reinforce that it is better to establish identity than to worry about other people's perceptions. Indeed, the characters go overboard on this, but I doubt most people will go that far. If people just look behind characters' motives and try to see the lingering doubts, the movie becomes far more intelligible and less of a macho bash.
B00004YKUY|4.0|I was a skeptic too about a Journey with out Steve Perry until two things happened. The first is that I saw them in concert. The second is that I bought this album as a result of hearing some of the new songs in concert.<BR>The concert was excellent and the fans were great. I also saw Journey during the Raised On Radio tour. Was Augeri as good as Perry?<BR>Close enough. His voice isn't quite as good as Perry's. Then again Perry's voice isn't what it used to be either. Compare his voice from Escape and Frontiers to that of Trial By Fire. Steve Perry in his prime had a magical voice, but now it is not as silky smooth and he seems to have trouble hitting the high notes. He sounds great in Trial By Fire but the songs are sung differently I believe due to the changes in his voice. So if I have to compare today's Augeri with today's Perry, like I said close enough and much better than nothing.<BR>As far as this album, I like it better than Trial By Fire. This album kind of sneaks up on you. At first listen you think ya' there are some good songs but nothing great. Then after a few turns through the CD player, you find yourself singing along to almost all songs. Although there aren't any really big smash hits, all of the material is very good and well worth the money.<BR>In all reality its not the voice that is miss so much as the song writing trio of Perry, Cain and Schon. Those guys are awesome together. As with any team, if you take away, or try to replace a key player, it changes the whole thing. Journey is one of my all time favorite bands. I would give anything to have them back as they were in the 80s. However the band has moved on and so must the fans. Rating: 4 1/2 Stars.
B00005K3NY|4.0|Scanners was filmed in 1980, and it shows in the clothes, the southern california hippie-commune dialog, and the props. In the early 80's there was a huge emphasis on cults, astral projection, and jogging, all of which show up as influences in this film in one form or another.<BR> But the mental warfare plot, the special effects, and the stunning beginning AND ending, elevate this film above average.  I've often said this is the horror film the beach boys were destined to make if they'd continued down that Charlie Manson path.<BR>  Stephen Lack would never again reach the acting summit he does here, but Michael Ironside is the true standout.  He plays a complete bastard with his usual effortless ease.<BR>   I removed a star for the simple fact that the plodding pace of this film annoys me.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Renowned director Lars Von Trier's stroke of genius in making his 2000 film DANCER IN THE DARK was to cast Iceland-born avant-pop siren Bjork in the central role and then enlist her aid in composing and performing a series of musical numbers for the movie. In the film, Bjork's character Selma lives an unrelentingly hard life as a single mother and factory worker who is quickly going blind. The film's songs come from Selma's inner world, where she (and the audience) find respite from all the harshness of reality.<br />Bjork's compositions, with orchestral arrangements from Vince Mendoza, hang together on their own quite nicely. Catherine Deneuve (Bjork's co-star) and Radiohead's Thom Yorke make effective vocal cameos, but Bjork's voice and music are the central focus. As we hear the industrial sounds of the factory turn into the rhythm of a song, or follow Bjork's oddly intuitive melodic leaps through a dreamlike haze of strings, it becomes clear that her idiosyncratic writing style adapts quite well to the cinematic milieu. As usual, her uniquely entrancing singing style stands out above almost all else.
B00004XQP4|5.0|As I have charted the path of Green Day, I noticed that many people have bashed Green Day for either &quot;selling out&quot; or growing up.<br />I loved this CD.  The songs were great, fully of heavy meaning.  It held a lot of the old Green Day energy, with songs like Minority, and rampant insanity, Blood Sex and Booze, with a mix of heavy seriousness.<br />Before you dismiss a CD based on a harsh Music Critic's perspective, ask yourself &quot;Are you loyal to your band, or are you loyal to a critic?&quot;
B000002HH2|5.0|POST, Bjork's second release as a solo artist, mines the fertile soil of the eclectic musical terrain of post-modern pop. The album throbs in and out of ambient cadences with techno beats, slips into showtune theatrics, then reels back to the dance floor.<br />With a full plate of sounds already on the table, Bjork adds her own unique flare to the presentation, proving she is not easily pigeonholed. The lyrically-insistent opener, &quot;Army Of Me,&quot; is a relentless electronic grind that is typical of Bjork's vibe, but POST also digs into Western music's more organic resources. &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot; may be a remake of an old Hollywood showtune, but Bjork's version transcends the song's silver screen aloofness on the strength of her delightful screams (&quot;Zing, BOOM!!/You fall in love&quot;). It is directly followed by &quot;Enjoy,&quot; a lurching hypnotic nod with musical help from British trip-hop MC, Tricky; and the smooth, Bee Gees-like orchestration of &quot;Isobel,&quot; a swooning accompaniment to strobe light bongo drums which announces that the listener is no longer at a rave, but at a disco.<br />POST shows off Bjork's grasp of technology, history and basic pop aesthetics. Few modern rock albums have sampled so many different facets of the atypical buffet and have come up with such tasty results.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I caught the Sade concert last night (fantastic show). Opening for that amazing lady was India Arie, a performer I had never even heard of. Thank you, Sade, for turning me on to one of the most heartfelt singer/songwriters I have heard in some time. I bought India's CD at the show and have been listening to it non-stop for 24 hours. Despite my relative naivete, I am blown away by the mix of groove, peace, and emotion the blend of vocals and strings on this CD has. Shades of Jill Scott, Sade, Dionne Farris, Me'Shell Ndegeocello, and even Lauren Hill ring through this sound. I think this lady will be around for quite some time.
B000002HPV|5.0|As one of modern music's most enigmatic and consistently entertaining personalities, Bjork has never shied away from the edge. Whether making straight ahead dance music, exploratory modern rock, or even show-tune-caliber drama, her vision has always remained innovative and original. Her voice jumps, in the space of a syllable, from a kitten-like purr to a banshee's howl, and is never anything less than captivating. HOMOGENIC, her latest musical endeavor, finds her plunging headlong into electronica, a form well-suited to her intense, offbeat phrasing and tone.<br />From the skittering breakbeats and ghostly wails of the opening &quot;Hunter&quot; to the all-out electronic crash that is &quot;Pluto,&quot; HOMOGENIC explores the melding of human and machine. The drama of &quot;Bachlorette&quot; finds a lush, rich string section following a tripping electronic beat, giving way to the Icelandic wonder's trademark wail. The juxtaposition of thoroughly modern sounds with conventional elements, such as symphonic arrangements, pipe organ, and accordion, form a central theme, to which HOMOGENIC's title undoubtedly refers. On HOMOGENIC, the traditional and the technological find their meeting point in Bjork's soaring, otherworldly voice.
6304504012|5.0|A very powerful adaptation of the Weber and Rice Musical<br />It is not a stage adaptation but has been made into an electrifying movie<br />It begins with the announcement of Eva Peron's passing at a movie theater and then we get a glimpse into Evita's early life of poverty and rejection. The political passions and earthshaking national event s at the time are brilliantly portrayed .I was not a fan of Madonna's until I saw Evita and that gave me a great new admiration for the singer<br />Superb portrayals by Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce and a Cameo appearance by Andrea Corr (of the Irish band ,the Corrs)<br />I was glued to my chair throughout and immediately  wanted the music for keeps so I shortly afterwards went out and bought the soundtrack

I just bought this  a month ago and I feel the same way as the (real) person who posted this : ) I am a fan of Dusty and Burts music also. I had never heard EC's music before....so I took a chance at buying this. He does have an earthy sound ! The naysayers did not discourage me from buying this but I was disapointed that there were no words to the songs in the cover case. I have no idea what he is singing about  ! Ha !   Also , one song blends right into the next as far as \\" his sound \\" goes. ( all sound the same ). But I like it any how .
0141301139|4.0|There seems to have been a major shift in children's literature recently, thanks, of course, to the pre-eminence of Harry Potter.  The latter is a hero parents can be proud of - bespectacled, middle-class, studious: the subtext is education is fun, enlightening and empowering.  <br />The major children's writer before JK Rowling was Roald Dahl, who boasted few of these virtues, offering children cruel wit, and a morbid, often murderous mistrust of parents, adults, education and authority in general.  He also implied that children could be malevolent and destructive.  Parents hated him - I had to discover Dahl through friends; my mum bought me Enid Blyton.  There was always the thrilling feeling that you were doing something illicit or conspiratorial reading Roald Dahl.<br />The hero of 'Fantastic Mr Fox' is a thief, a violater of property and business, and a murderer and torturer of animals, traits unlikely to endear him to the English middle classes.  On the other hand, he rejoices in family values, still endearingly in love with his wife, and a great father.  Under impossible odds, he tries to save his family and a host of other animals from the cruelty of three vile farmers, Boggis, Bunce and Bean, who are sick of the varmint's nocturnal sorties for their produce.  <br />First they try to shoot him, but only pepper his tail (a deliciously gruesome episode).  Next they dig into his tunnel, but he can dig faster.  They use huge mechanical diggers, turning a hill into a valley.  They try to starve him, surrounding the area with weapon-wielding minions.<br />The story of 'Fox' is very simple with few twists and turns.  The impact, however, can be traumatic, and not just for young children - I read this to my wife (as you do), and we both got very anxious for our heroes, faced with the terrifying industrial might of the farmers.  The irony of the story is ecological - while trying to save a few goods for business, the farmers nearly destroy the countryside and an entire animal network; the fox can only do what is natural, which is steal and kill (to which Dahl is faithful with admirable unsentimentality).  The image of the three farmers waiting, possibly forever, at the hole for the fox to starve, is chilling and close to Beckett.  <br />Once again, Dahl gets a great deal of pleasure in frightening his young audience, and his way with alliterative insults is as delightful as ever, while Quentin Blake's scribbles, though not part of the original book, are now so synonymous with Dahl's world, it's impossible to imagine it without them.
6304806426|5.0|well, is it?  i rented &quot;The English Patient&quot;, thinking it would be slow and boring . . . but i was wrong.  this movie was superb!  i don't understand how you couldn't adore this movie!  <BR>  the story isn't all that complicated: Hanna is a Canadian nurse serving in WWII Italy, where she discovers a horribly-burned &quot;English patient&quot;, thanks to his accent.  the hospital has to move, and Mr. English Patient cannot be moved far, so Hanna moves him to an abandoned monistary, where she can care for him.  she listens to his stories and discovers he is really Count Laslo Almasy, a wealthy Hungarian archeologist, doing some map-making for the British Army in the late 1930s.  he falls in love with the married Katherine (a rather dull but beautiful Kristin Scott Thomas) and they embark on a passionate but doomed affair.<BR>  meanwhile, Hanna is joined by David Caravaggio (a brilliant Willem Dafoe), a Canadian intelligence agent, who holds some distubing secrets about Almasy.  Caravaggio is thumbless, and he blames the Count for it.  <BR>  as Almasy's stories go on, Hanna and Caravaggio listen deeply about the tragic love story that ends rather sadly: the Count was burned in a plane crash, carrying the body of Katherine back to Cairo.  it all ends in a sad but artistic and beautiful ending, with Almasy dying, and . . . well, watch the movie and find out for yourself!<BR>  truly a sad masterpiece, &quot;The English Patient&quot; won 9 Academy Awards, including Best Picutre and Director for Anthony Minghella.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Yes, \\"Memento\\" essentially shatters the noir genre...shatters it to pieces and doesn't bother to stop and pick them up again...\\"Memento\\" just keeps on going leaving the wreckage of a genre in it's wake.<br />And the devastation is breath taking.<br />O.K...so maybe that intro overstates the case for \\"Memento\\" being THE great noir film of the 21st Centuty. But still \\"Memento\\" takes the film noir genre and it's concerns and wraps them up in the trappings of postmodern thought to take the genre where it's never gone before. It's all here, if you watch close enough: text v. body, perception, reality, identity, the self as a construct...these and more are postmodern themes that have been beaten to death in the literature. When these are combined with the traditional themes and trappings of the film noir, you end up with \\"Memento.\\"<br />The tried and true noir themes and signs are here: a lead character who has no clue what is really going on, the femme fatale, the third party manipulator, the shadows, et al.  What \\"Memento\\" does is take these noir trappings and raise them to the nth degree of confusion. ... This is also an outre and compelling crime story...disorienting as all hell, but that's part of the fun.<br />And the question remains...how do you make a noir film after \\"Memento?\\"  I don't know, but if \\"Memento\\" is any indication, we're in for a new noir renaissance.

B000002MTU|5.0|Quite simply, this is the best album I own.  &quot;From the Cradle&quot; has the best guitar work I have ever heard; so much so in fact, that I believe this album alone proves Clapton to be the best guitarist...ever.  Add Clapton's incredible voice and his superb musical mind to his one of a kind guitar work, and the result is an album on which every song is unique, while every song is similar in that each will blow your mind.

But I read four other books this weekend that had me gripped tight! i can't relate or get into the characters. I don't understand why they do what they are doing. and sometimes i think the author's language, sentence construction and word choices are getting in the way of telling the story. with this book, i have the same frustrated feeling i sometimes get when i don't quite understand what makes some modern art so &quot;good.&quot;
0060987464|5.0|Although I am not a huge fan of some of his music, I am truly fascinated with him.  There was more to meets the eyes with Manson, and so when his book came out, I snatched it up.<br />Sure enough, this was a great chronicle of his life and how he became who we all see today.  He debunks what his critics and vehement opposers say of him being an antichrist.  He says he just shows people how he views the world by his music and concerts/performances.  In other words, he's imitating society and showing us what we are like when it boils down to society's morals vs. its actions.  He is our collective reflection.<br />In this book we see that Manson is intelligent, thoughtful, and yes, strange.  But I urge all of those who see him as satanic to read this book and appreciate this man's work.

0380788624|4.0|I found the ending of this 918 page book to be something of a let down, but the journey was most rewarding.  One of the most irksome things was that a character crucial to the ending (Andrew) was barely covered in the early portions of the book. Andrew needed more fleshing out.<br />The author left plenty of avenues to explore in a sequel.  I hope Mr. Stephenson does so.
0316777722|5.0|CAUTION: \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is one of the FUNNIEST books you'll EVER read. You'll laugh out loud until you're embarrassed.

The book's first half has stories on various subjects (family, art class, teaching writing, working for tough bosses etc.). The second deals with his experiences in moving to France with his lover.<br />Sedaris spares no one -- not his father, sister, teachers, artists or himself -- from his scapel-sharp, insight-filled humor. Some wisecracks are instant classics. When he tries to<br />become an artist, dabbling in questionable performance art, he writes of artists: \\"Their artworks were known as `pieces,' a phrase I enthusiastically embraced. `Nice piece,' I'd<br />say. In my eagerness to please, I accidentally complimented chipped baseboards and sacks of laundry waiting to be taken to the cleaners. Anything might be a piece if you looked at<br />it hard enough.\\"<br />When a museum wants him to do some performance art it seemed \\"as though I should play hard to get, but after a moment or two of awkward silence, I agreed to do it for what I called `political reasons.' I needed the money for drugs.\\"<br />In a chapter detailing the lives and deaths of his various pets: \\"When my mother died and was cremated herself we worried that, acting on instinct, our father might run out and<br />immediately replace her.\\" When he's invited to teach: \\"I was clearly unqualified yet I accepted the job without hesitation, as it would allow me to wear a tie and go by the name<br />Mr. Sedaris.\\" And what a sadistic French teach told him:\\"Every day spent with you is like having a cesarean section.\\"<br />In his most innovative \\"piece,\\" a chapter called Big Boy, he describes his battle with (ahem) something he sees in a toilet.

0380817683|5.0|I've been in a spree of buying &quot;entertainment&quot; books - books to make me laugh and just enjoy a good (but predictable) girl story.  I've come to expect such predictability and a &quot;lightness&quot; that means that I'll finish the book in an afternoon. Rachel's Holiday was not what I expected and I loved it.  It has much more serious tones, actual character development and I really couldn't figure out how it was going to finish until I read the last page.  It was still a pretty quick read, but more like 3 days than an afternoon.  I'm really looking forward to reading other work by Keyes.
0930289234|5.0|I'd written in my review of Marvels that it was my favorite graphic novel of all time...I guess I hadn't read enough graphic novels.  The Watchmen is easily as good as Marvels, The Dark Knight Returns, or what have you.  This is a super-hero epic designed for adults who have a serious interest as comic books as an art form.  The term \\"graphic novel\\" is sometimes misapplied to over-blown comic books...that is not the case here.  Alan Moore is a great writer (arguably the best in the field) and, in The Watchmen, he has created a story of great depth, scope, and meaning.  I have discovered internet sites dedicated to pointing out the hidden subtexts and motifs of this book...they are not reading too much into it.  The task Moore sets for himself (as he often does) is to ask the question, \\"What would the world be like if super-heroes really existed?\\"  That question is more far-reaching than the average comic book implies.  The plot unfolds, not in a comic book way, but the way it might really happen.  The ending is completely original and totally unexpected.<br />On a personal note, this book will forever be entwined in my mind with the events of September 11, 2001.  Some of the issues in the book cut a little too close to home.  But for me specifically, I'll remember staying up late the night before reading this book, and then being awakened by my roommates early the next morning to the scene of the World Trade Center in flames...and thinking that I'd read the comic for too long.  Things this terrible don't happen in the real world, only in comic books...right?

B00003JRCQ|5.0|What a wonderful adaptation on Jane Austen's fine novel. The performances bring to life the characters that Jane Austen's words inspired. Amanda Root's performance as the long-suffering Anne Elliott is perfectly understated. Her transformation from 'one who has lost her bloom' into one who is able to love again is wonderful to observe. Who cannot fall in love with Ciaran Hinds portrayal of the dashing Captain Wentworth? It is perfection itself. Supporting actor Corin Redgrave obviously relished his role as the ridiculously vain Sir Elliot, and most impressive was Sophie Thompson as Mary Musgrove. After watching her performance as the old maid Miss Bates in the 1996 version of Emma, I appreciate her portrayal of the jealous hypochondriac Mary Musgrove even more. Fiona Shaw &amp; John Woodvine as Sophie and Admiral Croft were a breath of fresh air. Susan Fleetwood is convincing as Lady Russell and honorable mention should go to the actors who portrayed Captain's Harville &amp; Benwick and of course those who portrayed the Musgroves. My only complaint as a Jane Austen purist: I loathe convenient deviations from her original novel and this version fails the novel through it's portrayal and storyline involving Mr. Elliot and Mrs. Smith. I was most particularly grieved by the insertion of an unnecessary scene involving Captain Wentworth offering to quit Kellynch on behalf of Admiral and Mrs. Croft. Despite these two atrocities, I find that the performances make this a must see adaptation.
B00003CXTG|3.0|This movie had a great plot, directing, and acting.  The problem with it was the fact that it was too long!  If you took the frist half and shortened it to about 30-45 min. then keep the rest, I would have given it 6 stars!

B00004U30D|4.0|This flick is a string of tired ol' images and characters. The plot is worn out; every concept is borrowed and boring. Everything about this flick is a cliche. On the surface. I think that was by design. Oooh that's scary. You can't say one bad thing about the performances, the script, the cinematography or the score. And if you can, well... I don't wanna talk to you anymore -- you're obviously WAY too smart for me. (ah-hem) This is one of those movies that will surprize you if you let it. After purchasing this version and viewing it, I felt like it'd let me down... but then, discussing it a few days later, I realized there was still more that I got out of it (I saw it on the big screen three times, and this was the fourth overall.) I'm still convinced that some stuff coulda been left off, but I'm willing to give it a chance next time around. So what about the second tape? This version has additional footage: it has trailers for other movies (I love that, it reminds you of what all came out at the same time), it has the awards reel (I think they call it the awards reel) what the studio sends to the awards shows' voters, I guess, with all of the critics' blah, blah, blah and a little &quot;making of&quot; action... it's OK. The rest of the second tape is Conrad Hall and what's-his-name-the-director going over the storyboards. At first, it was like zzzzzzzzzzzz, but it's OK too, if you're into that sort of thing -- y'know, the sort of thing that's in the DVD, but no-one every really watches. No-one really watches, but when they find out you don't have a DVD player, they tell you about like you're missing out or something.

B00005NP04|5.0|To say that Martina McBride has an amazing voice is a gross understatement.  I can't find the words to describe Martina's vocal ability except to say that it is second to none.  This cd contains 13 of her greatest hits including 4 #1's, 1 song that she always thought should be a single and 4 new songs.  Those 4 new songs are as good as anything she's ever done and that's saying something.  &quot;Where Would You Be&quot;, in my opinion, is her best vocal performance to date, &quot;Concrete Angel&quot; proves that she can perform a song without belting it out and still convey the feeling, this is one of the saddest songs i've ever heard and Martina conveys that message beautifully, &quot;Blessed&quot; is a great song and Martina does a great job.  I've heard her say that this song could have been written just for her about her life and &quot;When God Fearin Women Get the Blues&quot; is fun and sassy with alot of what I like to call &quot;Martina Attitude&quot; and it proves that Martina belongs in the country genre.  The 4 new songs alone are worth the price of the cd and the fact that Martina is donating a portion of the first month's sales to the disaster relief effort proves that her heart is as big as her voice.  Thank you Martina for being the class act that you are.  I am proud to be a fan.

B00003CXXJ|4.0|A great  movie with clever writting, and a sarcastic tone. It works quite well. Not a Disney-esqe film, by any stretch. Please don't go into the theatre expecting that. <br />I brought my 3 year old son to watch it, and all during the movie, I felt a little uneasy about exposing him to some things in it. The donkey curses one or two times, and Shrek says &quot;Jack***&quot; a couple of times, played for laughs. A fairly large amount of &quot;bloodless&quot; violence is also involved. <br />Face it, this is a PG film, and parents should heed the rating. Watch it first without the kids. If you want to show them after you screen it, believe me, you won't mind sitting through it again.
B000001G5A|4.0|Yes, I love this performance. It's is well articulated, the soloists are great. However there is one thing that did not wuite fit: the tempos. Sure some parts sound good in slow tempo while others feel like they are being dragged. Still, I think that this is one of the finest recordings you will find out there. If you can cope with some of the slower parts, you'll find the performance very rewarding.
0380778556|5.0|&quot;Last night i dreamt I went to Manderly again...&quot; and so the story begins. Daphne Du Maurier has woven &quot;Rebecca&quot; into one of the most captivating novels I have ever read. From the moment the main character is swept off her feet by an older man, and carried off to his wealthy estate, Manderly, until the last few pages of the novel--Du Maurier keeps the reader in a trance. The characters in her novel are intricate and personable, each with his or her own secret to reveal. There is a surprise around every corner, and a new twist in the plot when you least expect it. In addition to the ingenious story, &quot;Rebecca&quot; has captured the most briliant and ironic ending perhaps of all time.

B00005LB50|2.0|Nothing to add to the other reviews criticising the duplications, the omissions and the price, but just to add one observation: Just as the Byrds provided the sonic blueprint for the Springfield in the 60s, they (and with Sony) provided the model for how to do CD reissues: <br />(1) Take each of the original albums and remaster to the highest standard of sound<BR>(2) Add lots of bonus tracks (singles, B-sides, outtakes and demos) from the appropriate period of the band's history<BR>(3) Provide well-written and informative sleeve notes (4) Retain all original artwork and enhance with period photos, advertisements, posters, etc. <BR>(5) Find a classic unreleased live performance and add as a separate new album <BR>(6) Release (in chronological order) at mid-price<br />If Sony/Columbia/McGuinn can do it properly, I don't see why Rhino/Atco/Stills&amp;Young can't. <br />The music is great, but as a box set this is a non-starter.

B00005AKQF|5.0|This album really started it all for a lot of modern hip-hop junkies. At a time when hip-hop was quickly progressing to a sort of \\"dark-age\\", De La brought imagnitive lyrics, creative beats, and amazing production by the legendary Prince Paul.<br />I highly recommened this to anyone who enjoys good music. Especially those who wish to push their tastes a little, as it is unlike anything you've heard before. And for those who are new to De La, if you enjoy anything done by the Hiero crew, Prine Paul, the Roots, or Common, I could draw numerous comparisons. If you like any of those or others, please give this album a listen.
0440180295|4.0|Slaughterhouse 5 was written by Kurt Vonnegut in 1969.  Within the story, Kurt Vonnegut is an author who is writing another story.  The Kurt Vonnegut who is a character in the story is writing a book called The Children's Crusade.  In The Children's Crusade, Billy Pilgrim is the main character.  Vonnegut also makes connections between himself and Billy Pilgrim.  Billy Pilgrim is the main character in the story.   The first chapter is an introduction to the author, and his reasons for writing The Children's Crusade are explained.  Much of The Children's Crusade describes the horrors of World War II, specifically the firebombing of Dresden.  Vonnegut had first hand experience with the destruction caused at Dresden, so he had a strong basis for describing the war.  Strangely, in The Children's Crusade, Billy Pilgrim is &quot;unstuck in time&quot;, which means that he randomly travels through time to different periods of his life throughout the story.  The idea is that Billy has lived his whole life already and died, but now he continues to skip around through different moments which have already passed.  Billy spends much of the story going through his experiences at war.  He skips around to moments ranging from his life as an optometrist after the war to his abduction by space aliens known as Tralfamadorians.  Billy even experiences moments where he is already dead.  Both the structure and ideas of the story are intriguing and new to an unsuspecting reader.<BR>I recommend Slaughterhouse 5 because Kurt Vonnegut opens the reader's eyes to many ideas and problems which may not have even entered his or her head before.  The story portrays many different ideas ranging from the obscure outlooks on life given by the Tralfamadorians to horrors and inhumanities of war described by Billy Pilgrim and various other characters.  When the Tralfamadorians captured Billy Pilgrim and took him back to Tralfamadore, they shared their knowledge with him.  They believed that every event in the universe had already taken place and that humans were just living in one specific moment.  No one can change the future, because the future has already happened.  However, they say that Billy has become &quot;unstuck&quot; from the track of the lifetime that he was following and therefore skips from moment to moment uncontrollably.  As Billy skips through time, his moments at war depress him.  He and many others display their common hatred towards the war.  Kurt Vonnegut was obviously strongly opposed to the ideals of war and portrayed his feelings through Billy.  One of the main events of World War II that was thoroughly discussed in the story was the firebombing of Dresden.  Billy was present during the bombing of the city, when he and the rest of his company waited in a meat cellar so as not to come to any harm.  When the American soldiers emerged from the cellar the following day after the bombing had taken place, they were horrified.  Dresden had been left in ruins, and no person or other life form was left living.  Billy was sickened by the masses of civilian casualties.  Kurt Vonnegut obviously must have been opposed to the decision to destroy Dresden in such a complete and devastating manner.  Vonnegut's views on war and life are well supported and strongly portrayed in this story.<BR>The unique structure of the story makes me want to recommend this book to a potential reader as well.  The story skips suddenly in and out of different moments and events in Billy Pilgrim's life.  The seemingly unrelated and random moments are tied together by Vonnegut's carefully constructed common themes and ideas.  Vonnegut gives the reader a sense of how startling and sudden Billy's time travelling is.  <BR>Although I enjoyed the new, unique style of structure, it is easy to see how one might become confused and lost in such a twisted array of scenes and images.  A reader who is used to a straight forward, chronological plot structure will have trouble getting used toBilly Pilgrim's time travelling.  If one does not take his or her time while reading this book, the reader will lose track of the many intertwining plots and will not appreciate Vonnegut's style.  <BR>Slaughterhouse 5 is a well written story which forces the reader to think about and become involved in its strong opinions and ideas about war and life.  The structure shows that a book can be successful even if it varies from the traditional chronological plot line.
0446310786|5.0|As Harper Lee's one and only book, To Kill A Mockingbird is a story that everyone should read.  It focuses on the Depression in the south (Alabama) and on the lives of a lawyer and his family and a black man accused of raping a white woman.  It is both emotional and educational.  Everyone can learn something different from this story.
B00000K0EA|5.0|I have most of the Bond films, and this one is excellent.  Make no mistake: we all lost out due to Brosnan's Remington Steele contract which kept him away from Bond for years.  Don't get me wrong: Timothy Dalton was a good Bond, for my money, better than Roger Moore in his later flicks, but Brosnan is great.<br />&quot;Tomorrow&quot; has everything we've come to expect, but a new twist is added by throwing in someone from Bond's past with Terri Hatcher's character of Paris.  The great thing about this element is actual character development for Bond, which is something we really haven't seen in decades.  The regret, the pain that James shows is becoming something of a trademark for Brosnan's Bond.  (See the entire relationship with Electra King in &quot;The World is Not Enough&quot;.)<br />At long last, we're getting Bond with a soul.  Brosnan also brings a quiet air of menace that Bond hasn't had since Connery carried the Walther, which only makes the films better.  Sadly, I fear we may not get more than two or three more out of Brosnan before he decides to pass on the mantle.  &quot;Tomorrow&quot; has plenty of action, and one of the greatest Bond chase sequences ever.  Lots of cool gadgets, and pretty good screen time for Michelle Yeoh, who's a great counterpart for James.  Grab some popcorn (or perhaps a martini) and settle in for real entertainment.
B00001QEE7|5.0|The Little Mermaid has got to be the BEST Disney film ever made.  It was my personal favorite when I was younger and remains my favorite to this day.  The music is also great.  Ariel, the daughter of King Triton, yearns to be &quot;Part of That World&quot; above the water.  When she rescues and falls in love with the handsome Prince Eric, Ariel gives her voice to the wicked sea witch Ursula in exchange for human legs.  I can't imagine any child who has not seen this film yet, but if YOUR child hasn't (or if you haven't for that matter), RUSH NOW and BUY IT ASAP!  Don't even worry about &quot;renting&quot; it first.  Just buy it.  You know you want to.  You know it's that good!!  Take my word.  I'm a Disney fanatic, but TLM is the best!!

0385335482|5.0|I bought this book on a sunday at about 5. Began to read it in the bus, continued at home, went to bed at 1am. The day after I read it in the subway, and in the bus, got back from school and went to bed at 1am. And the day after, which is today, I read it again, bus, subway, school, subway, bus, walking. This is no joke. Its absolutely great. I just CANT wait for the next one coming out in January. What first caught my attention was the book cover. How interesting! I actually like to touch it! The story is great! Of course im not like that. Dont know much about the brand names shes talking about, but I figured out they must be quite expensive. It's funny, brilliant, the end is just great! As I read I can almost feel how she feels! Im happy or sad for her! Really, if I coud've, I would've read in one day. But Ive got school!
B00005N9CV|3.0|DISAPPOINTED and I blame Claus Ogerman's \\"rich orchestration.\\" I am a huge fan of Krall and prefer her in a minimalist musical environment. The lush strings and orchestral accompaniments take away from what we have all come to love about Krall (just that, Krall!!). Also, the song selections seem a bit bland and without much life. I'll admit I was really looking for something a bit more energetic, playful, and humorous. Didn't find it here. Guess I'll have to stick with the old material `til next year.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Movie Summary: Leonard Shelby has lost his wife and himself in a brutal attack in his own home. His wife has died and Lenny has lost the ability to create new memories. He lives in a fog where the things that have just happened quickly fade into oblivion. The last thing that he can remember is his wife; his wife dying. What keeps Lenny going is the search for his wife's killer. Because of his condition, he can't remember for more than a few minutes, so he uses notes, picture, tattoos, and conditioning to keep himself on track. After searching for who knows how long, Lenny has closed in on the man he has been looking for. But is it the right guy?<br />My Opinion: Memento was gripping from the very first moment and it hasn't let up even though I've finished watching it over 12 hours ago. I loved the concept of Lenny not being able to make any new memories. It fits excellently with the backward method the story is told with. It took some mental work to put the pieces together one by one as they happened, but I thoroughly enjoyed doing it. The plot was very tight since it had to be able to fit together in small slices backwards. This forced them to have a story that worked; something that other movies are sadly lacking. The subplot of Sammy Jankis rounds out a very full story and makes Memento something very special. I found the acting to be top notch Guy Pearce is awesome as Lenny. I didn't doubt his condition for an instant. Joe Pantoliano is equally as great playing Teddy. Leonard decides not to believe Teddy's lies. We are left on our own to decide. No mater what conclusion I come to about Teddy, one thing is certain: Memento is a highly entertaining movie. It is a prime example of why I love movies like I do. Don't miss it.<br />DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 2.35:1 with great video quality.  Sound: DD5.1  Extras: Tons of extras including the entire 50 page short story &quot;Memento&quot;, Cast Biographies, Newspaper clippings pictures notes and clues from the story, Interview with the director, and Trailers. Menus: The menus are freaky and very cool. Things appear and disappear from different options as you move around. You get flashes of things that make you feel like Lenny.<br />What You Should Do:  See this movie. See it on DVD and check out all the extra features. If you are a fan of intelligent movies that make you think while they entertain you, then you are going to want to own this DVD.<br />Related Movies To Check Out: The Matrix, Jacob's Ladder, The Ninth Gate, The Usual Suspectsrom the story, Interview with the director, and Trailers.

B00005NP04|5.0|This is a great compilation of probably the best voice in music and former female CMA vocalist of the year! They seemed to want to stay with the pop-country stuff and stay away from the honkytonk country, so nothing from her first album is on this collection. This will not bother most people. Evolution was her biggest album to date, so no surprise it has the most songs on this album-five. (Of course, they could have even taken more, like &quot;Be That Way&quot;, but when an album is as great as Evolution was, it's hard to get them all. They picked the five best though!)Early breakthroughs, such as &quot;Independence Day&quot; and &quot;Wild Angels&quot; are on here, as well as crossover hits such as &quot;Valentine&quot; (with Jim Brickman) and &quot;I Love You&quot; from the film Runaway Bride. My only complaint besides not enough of Evolution (explained above) is that they did not include &quot;It's My Time&quot; her last single from the Emotion album. Her new single, &quot;When God Fearing Woman Get the Blues&quot; is a little twangy, but is in heavy rotation on CMT. Overall, if you like her angelic voice on any song you have heard, this is an excellent collection to pick up!
0064471837|5.0|I have read lots of books and science fiction literature is my passion, I think it must be the same for Nix. In this book he shows awesome detail, and takes you on a thrilling and adventurous journy. The main charecters seem so real and their story is one I plan to read again and again. Sabriel is everything a reader schould want and more. A real page turner. I know from expirience, it will really take you.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I always found irritating the habit to place intro, outro and interludes everywhere (I consider those pieces are boring, useless and superfluous). Therefore if I tell you that I even do not skip them on this album, you can tell how pleased I am with it.<br />The album title says it all: this is acoustic soul. Far from Destiny's Child so called r'n'b, India composes songs that do not need the support of computerized bombastic rhythm to exist. Listening to the people she praises in the interlude tells you where the girl took her good taste from: Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke, Johnny Coltrane, Jimmy Hendrickx, Mary Robertson, Billie Holiday, Miles Davis, Minnie Ripperton, Ella Fitzerald... to name but a few &quot;and the list go on&quot; as she says herself. And even if they are &quot;all in her&quot; she remains her own self, creating her own music from all those influences.<br />I was seduced by the beautiful deep bluesy voice and her confident (but not &quot;in your face&quot;) attitude.<br />The first single &quot;Video&quot; was a perfect summer track. Gaining a positive image of yourself and sef confidence without becoming vain, this is what the song is about. Seriously, how many girls have the body of a top model? But who cares, if you love yourself and feel good in the skin your born in, people will love you too. Just grow to accept what you see in the mirror.<br />The next track &quot;Promises&quot; is a sensual and reflexive number about relationships (all kind of relationships) and how important honesty is to preserve them. Beautifully written and difficult not to groove on.<br />Are you looking for pure sugar hot song for your tea for two 5 o'clock secret rendez-vous? &quot;Brown skin&quot; is there for you. Suddenly the room temperature has raised at least 10 degrees...(centigrade, I'm in Europe). D'Angelo &quot;Untitled&quot; video, get the picture?<br />&quot;Strength, Courage and Wisdom&quot; has a great summery Latin vibe (I think about Sade here) mixed withclassic almost gospel chorus. The mix produces a very laid back track. <br />I love the deep voice and the pulsation on &quot;Nature&quot;. This track is pure silk.<br />Another silky track and one of my favorite is &quot;Back to the middle&quot; with a simple guitar/soft beat orchestration and India voice telling you a story... The song shows best India singing capabilities. I think about Tracy Chapman here. Actually, if Tracy was playing blues/r'n'b she would probably sound like India, and if India was playing folk she would probably sound like Tracy...<br />Next one is a jewel: &quot;Ready for love&quot;, a sensitive love declaration. To be played in the dark or danced to in the candles lights. Stripped down orchestration, beautiful vocal rendition, one of the best ballads around. Worth buying the album just for this one!<br />Marvin Gaye would not repudiate &quot;Always in my head&quot; and I will not either. Sensual and classy, you'll move your hips and snap your fingers before you know it.<br />A call to each other respect is following with &quot;I see God in you&quot; and its killer chorus. One of those songs you got stuck in your head before you noticed you heard it.<br />The rhythm of &quot;Simple&quot; makes me think about Mary J Blige on &quot;Mary&quot;. That's r'n'b with soul.<br />&quot;Part of my life&quot; is another sensual danceable track inspired by Marvin Gaye.<br />Another great ballad to close the album &quot;Beautiful&quot; has a very simple guitar based orchestration once again, letting India's voice space to tell you her story, and multiplying her voice on the chorus, creating a nice dreamy effect.<br />Finally, we even get a bonus track, &quot;Wonderful&quot; obviously inspired by Stevie Wonder. The title summarizes my feeling about the entire album: this kitty here is purring blissfully in the sun

B00005NW02|5.0|What a great CD! Lemme give you a run down of the CD<br />1. Prison SONG: Great song, starts out fast stays that way.  The singer's voice changes throughout the song.  Great song if I was to rate out of 10, 10 is given<BR>2. Needles: Good song, fast and furious, just the lyrics make this one a 9/10<BR>3. Deer Dance: fast, then slow, but totally awesome.  Great song and great beat and lyrics.  Definetly a 10!<BR>4. Jet Pilot: Another good song.  Fast riff and great beat.  9.25/10 :)<BR>5. X (Multiply): Great SONG!  Hard Riffs, great beat and great lyrics.  Tempo changes slightly and sounds awesome!<BR>10/10<BR>6. Chop Suey!: BEST SONG ON ALBUM!  only forest, prison song and ATWA compare, but this song flat out kicks ....  Starts slow, hits hard, goes slow, and then hits it hard again.  Great lyrics Guitar sounds oddly tuned, but it fits perfectly.  11/10.<BR>7. Bounce: GOod song, but coming after Chop Suey is a hard act to follow.  Good song better than needles or jet pilot, just not the best song.  9.5/10<BR>8. Forest: GOod LOrd how awesome!  Only slightly less than Chop Suey!  Great song.  Tempo similar to Chop Suey, but awesome lyrics, my second favorite song on CD. 10/10<BR>9. ATWA: Great song, with a great lead in from Forest.  Mostly slow, but has a few heavy and hard hitting riffs.  Great song 10/10<BR>10. Science:  Good song, good riffs, great lyrics.  not much to say, definetly a good song 9.5/10<BR>11. Shimmy: Short but sweet.  Hard and Great lyrics, only wish it was longer, but thats ok :) 9.5/10<BR>12. Toxicity: ANother Awesome song! SLow and then hard like many of the previous great songs, another 11/10 song<BR>13. Psycho: Dark song, but great song.  Hard riffs and great lyrics and tempo.  10/10<BR>14. Aerials: Longest song on CD, but does that matter? no, its a great song.  Great way to end the CD.  10/10<br />THis is a great CD, it mixes slow and hard tempos together to create a sound your ear will love.  I am new to the S of a D scene, I just decidedto buy this CD because I liked Sugar and Spiders off the last CD, but this CD blew me away.  Its the first CD in a while that I could listen to the entire thing straight through.  I highly recommend it. THanks for reading.
B00005OAIE|5.0|..because this album deserves 10 stars! It's extremely rare these days that you can find an artist that encompasses the lyrical and musical talent that John Mayer does. At 23 years of age, he is writing music that a 70 year old musical veteran would be forever jealous of. <br />From the first times I heard John, I knew he was going to make a huge mark in music someday. Looks like the cat is out of the bag now.<br />John Mayer's major-label release of &quot;Room for Squares&quot; is one of the most amazing albums I've ever had the pleasure of hearing and owning. And my cd collection is pretty extensive. <br />Lyrically it is heartbreaking, uplifting, and unforgiving all at once. Invoking emotions that you forgot voice and song could still do. Musically it will make you tap your feet and bob your head even in public places. It is an album that you can listen to all the way through and rediscover each time. I don't think of each song as &quot;good or bad&quot;. I think of them as &quot;they are all amazing songs&quot;, I just happen to like this one more and that one a little less on certain days and moods. <br />From the opening track &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, a &quot;look at me now&quot; song that's basically about where life takes you after you're out of school and still dreaming, to the beautiful closing track &quot;St Patrick's Day&quot; in which he describes the relationships you get into out of need and slight desperation around the holiday season from November to March, this is a must have for any fan of Rock/Pop. Every song will make you smile and go &quot;damn, those are some tasty tunes!&quot; <br />For Mayer fans that already own the initial RFS release, I urge you to buy this album again! The 7 remixed tracks are extremely well done, not to mention the addition of &quot;3x5&quot;, which is an amazing song. It's worth the price, believe me.<br />So, what are you waiting for, click the button, run out to the store, spend the money, take the chance, scream at the top of your lungs. Just get this album and you'll kick yourself that you hadn't gotten it sooner.

B00005NI5Y|5.0|I've been a Bob fan for years: chillin' to his smokey voice, laid back style, and amazing lyrics.  I have always considered Bob to be a &quot;folksie blues&quot; musician.  This new album seems to be in an entirely different vein.  Gone is much of his 60's protest vibe heard in his old stuff and the &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; soundtrack, but replacing it is an amazing combo of blues and crooning ballads. The opener &quot;Tweedledee&quot; is a clincher and your attention is held through to &quot;Sugar Baby&quot;, which sounds like memory in song. Despite his age, his singing still pierces and the tunes are surprisingly contempory and so much better than much of the garbage being recorded at present.  Bob still has his finger on the pulse of the times and renders another modern classic.
0312954468|5.0|What an amazing book!  Wilbur Smith is a treasure!  I am torn between this and Monsoon as to my favorite.  This is an incredible epic told from a wonderful (albeit sometimes vain perspective).  I thoroughly enjoyed seeing ancient Egypt through the eyes of the narrator and watching the world change around him.  I HIGHLY recommend this book and the sequel, The Seventh Scroll.
B00005NZBN|5.0|This album reminds me of &quot;New Morning&quot; with its diversity of musical styles, but it is a lot better than &quot;New Morning&quot; in terms of musical performances, lyrics and strength of songs. It is in the top 10 of Bob Dylan's albums in his career. It is not as good as &quot;Freewheelin'&quot;, &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, &quot;Highway 61 Revisted&quot; and perhaps a few others, but then again almost nothing in the history of rock or pop are as good as those albums. It is the best album which Bob Dylan has released since 1974.
B000050IE6|5.0|I barely listen to metal anymore. Aghast, Brighter Death Now and Sol Invictus have taken the place of Darkthrone, Immortal and Emperor. (Well, perhaps not Emperor) But I cannot deny my Black/Death Metal roots. After all, Emperor was my introduction to dark music. It is, in a sense, sad to look back at my early Metal CDs and do not have them in such high esteem as I once had them, so I occasionally place some of those CDs on my player and spend the day listening to some raw metal.<br />But truth be said, Opeth has always been the exception. Easily put, Opeth are master musicians and there is no turn of the page. Even though they started playing Death Metal, since the very beginning the forged themselves a fine style woven in brutal melodic guitars and acoustic moments that always has a place on my CD player.<br />This style has been growing with time, each CD presenting a new and more technical Opeth, each time sounding more like anything else but metal. The variety of styles mixed in &quot;Still Life&quot; creates a new, more folkish-like, sound of an intoxicating nature. The acoustic guitar during the early minutes of &quot;The Moor&quot; reaches a peek were it almost sounds like classical Spanish guitar!<br />Opeth is following a nice and wise direction, similar to the one Empyrium has gone through. I can't wait for Opeth to release a purely acoustic album. Just imagine that: An acoustic/Folkish Opeth album with powerful growls! WOW!
B00005K3O0|4.0|Four time Oscar nominee, Marsha Mason, is absolutely fabulous in &quot;Audrey Rose&quot;, and makes you wish she'd made more movies. Anthony Hopkins matches her every step of the way, too. This is not really a thriller. Under the sturdy direction of Robert Wise, this is an absorbing, psychological drama which advocates reincarnation. It's a good film, and it sure makes you hope for more Marsha Mason movies to make it to DVD. MORE MARSHA! Please!
B00005JKES|1.0|Oh my god,  This is like buying the Star Wars trilogy that doesnt come with Star Wars!  Jeez, and the pilot was the best one of all of them.  Warner Brothers needs to get their heads out of their rear-ends and do something about this.  (And of course, the series rocks.) But the pilot not being in there with it totally brings down the stars to near nothing.  Sorry, I think I will buy it when its actually all there guys.
B00003CY3W|3.0|Ghost World disappointed me.  I love the comic, and I couldn't believe all of the fantastic stuff Clowes left out when transferring his work to the screen.  The deadpan tone that works so well in the book falls flat on the screen, it makes the girls, who in the book are anything but, seem numb and cardboard.<br />The set design was fantastic!  What a wonderful use of color!  The world evoked on the screen looked so much like the world in the comic book.  I was impressed.<br />I'm not sure I recommend this film, although I wholeheartedly recommend reading the comic book... if you like it, then I say go see the film, it's always pretty cool to see the printed page unfurling on the big screen, even if you're not thrilled by the way it turns out!
B00005N9CV|5.0|This should be subtitled &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes, Part 2.&quot; Diana Krall has produced a wonderful follow-up, with great songs (the after-hours kind), great sidemen (Russell Malone, Christian McBride, etc), great arrangements (Claus Ogerman), great sound (Al Schmitt), etc.<br />Congratulations, Lady Di...another winner!!!
B000002NJS|5.0|all i have to say is: wow!!! this album is amazing. it's truely a masterpiece, madonna's best. it has everything: pop, rock, alternative, electronic, dance and it even has an indian song!!! if you want a differnt madonna, not the disco-pop one, this is for you!!! i love it, and it's a great album, i'm sure you'll love it!
B00005NWM3|1.0|Other then the single they released for radio this album is garbage. Musically this album sounds like it was first made in the early 90's. It lacks a creativity I was anticipating when i bought the album. I recommend you save your money and just buy the single of &quot;How you remind me&quot;, I wish i would have.
B00005NP04|5.0|Martina McBride has probably the most powerful voice in country music. This new hits collection gives you a sample of her powerful pipes. &quot;A Broken Wing&quot; and &quot;Whatever You Say&quot; are two fine examples of Martina's talent. There's not a weak track to be found here. I've seen her in concert twice and both times I was amazed at the sound coming from this woman. Her newest single, &quot;When God Fearing Women Get The Blues&quot; is another that shows off her voice, a fun song about a woman run amuck, a theme she visits time and again. This is a great set to have in your collection, Martina may not have the pull of say Shania Twain or Faith Hill, but she certainlly has one of the better voices in music today and this set proves it.
0345337581|5.0|I first read and studied this book in 1974 after getting out of the USAF. I attended a college in '75 where the first week was entirely freshman, over 500 of them. Before the end of the week I had all but two of their names memorized (I never met those two people.) It blew everyone away that I could remember their names after a 5 minute &quot;hello.&quot; I graduated from this very difficult school with 3.65/4.0. After 30 years I am once again in training getting ready to test for the US Post Office where number memorization is paramount.

And the prose...!<BR>For a techie, Stephenson crafts the best paragraphs I've read since Tolkien.<BR>I recommend this to any novel reader, not just sci-fi or cyperpunk fans.<BR>As a matter of fact, there is one bad thing about this book: everything I've read since seems lame by comparison.
B0000065O1|5.0|Cindy Crawford takes you through a safe and effective workout, without all the false encouragement and fake personality. I don't know about you, but the last thing I want to see when I wake up at 5:30 every morning is some bubbly person chanting, &quot;You can do it! Look at you, you're burning fat!&quot; Just let me exercise!<BR>It's just Cindy exercising, and the camera focuses at her from different angles so that you don't get lost in the crowd. The music is great, (not the workout elevator music), and the exercises are easy to follow. My friend has stuck to this video for over a year and she looks amazing. I have been working out with it for a week, and I already feel and see a difference. Definitely worth every penny!
0782008372|5.0|This movie is by far one of the best science fiction movies of all time. Sean Connery once again shown that he has done what most actors have failed to do; get rid of being steroetyped as on single character, i.e. James Bond. Christopher Lambert is excellent as the Highlander, It is on my top ten list of best movies along with a few othe Sean Connery Movies.
0441172717|5.0|Beginning with Dune and following the series through each subsequent novel was one of the most entertaining experiences I've ever had. The Dune series will always be one of my all time favorite reads! The series has everything, psychology, sociology, religion, adventure and engaging characters all woven together masterfully by Herbert's prose.
0553208845|5.0|This book demonstrates the conflicts and questions a young prince has early in life. Seemingly to have everything from inception there is a longing for his soul to be quenched with something else, something more. Many can relate to looking for the answers before finally finding them within. A great inpiration and a wonderfully written novel.
B000002U82|5.0|This CD is most certainly one of Pink Floyd's greatest. The pure musical genius is clearly displayed all throughout all the tracks of this album. And yet while this album is a concept album in that all the tracks are centered around death and the like, it is one that all listeners will most assuredly enjoy - it is for Pink Floyd fans and those who are not quite so fond alike. Below I will make a sumary of all the tracks:<BR>1.) Speak To Me/Breathe in Air - This song is the perfect example of the concept album notion that I mentioned above. It begins with a subtle yet steadily rising heart beat and then evolves into Breathe in Air which is quite a pleasant little song about the finite-ness of life.<BR>2.) On the Run - An intrumental number that is, once again, a concept song. There is music integrated in with an airport announcer along with footsteps and heavy breathing - obviously a man running to catch a flight - although he never catches it. As the song comes to an end, a loud 'explosion' is heard - presumably the plane the man was running to catch blowing up.<BR>3a.) Time - A wonderful track starting out with the ringing of clock alarms (as per the title) and then evolving into music along with lyrics speaking of the briefness of life.<BR>3b.) Breathe Reprise - Just a brief yet pleasant revisit to Breathe in Air which was featured earlier in the album.<BR>4.) The Great Gig in the Sky - an intrumental number, save some integrated dialouge and the famous egg toward the middle of the song where a woman effectively whispers &quot;If you can hear this little whisper, you're dying.&quot; 5.) Money - Probably the most famous of the tracks on this album, this song is obviously about money. The singer of the song is portraying a greedy yet realistic view of money.<BR>6.) Us and Them - a quaint little song sounding not unlike the song, not the album mind you, Wish You Were Here, obviously by Pink Floyd. This song is illustrating a war, clearly a metaphorical one, thus explaining the title, Us and Them. There is no indication in the lyrics what the war is over, the only indication being &quot;With, Without; And who can deny this is what the fightings all about.&quot;<BR>7.) Any Colour You Like - an strictly intrumental song that is meant to be played in conjuction with the following two songs.<BR>8.) Brain Damage - A quasi-mellow yet entertaining song telling the story of a man going insane and attempting to take his own life. I'm of the opinion that this song is about drugs and the use thereof.<BR>9.) Eclipse - the closing track of the album illustrating which is quite eccentric. The track closes with a fading heart beat, opposite the steadily rising one of the first track.<BR>This album is truly an excellent one that I highly reccommend. As I said before, it can be enjoyed by Pink Floyd fans and non-Pink Floyd fans alike.
0671027344|5.0|Summary- We know nothing of his location but everything about his life.  A freshman in high school, Charlie is just beginning to discover himself.  Charlie starts out the school year lonely, with his brother being away at college and his sister busy with more important matters (boys!).  That changes pretty quickly, however.  After Charlie meets Nothing and Sam his secluded, wallflower world is rocked.  As Charlie sees his world start to tumble and shake, he probes into the meaning of everything around him.  Charlie chronicles these events and his feelings to a person we never meet.  Charlies letters recount his adventure into unfamiliar territories so many people have gone through themselves.<br />My Review/ Recommendations- I choose this book because my parents had read it and loved it.  I found the letters hilarious and sincere, yet extremely thought provoking.   You either completely identify with Charlies realistic experiences of his first year in high school or you become prepared to be in his predicaments.  Plus you meet such a vibrant array of characters you cant help but get totally wrapped up in the story.  Patrick, aka Nothing, is Charlies gay friend who sleeps with the quarterback of the football in secret and was popular until he got hooked onto good music.  Sam, the girl Charlie thinks he is in love with is Patricks stepsister has trouble with boyfriends and has trouble with self confidence, according to Charlies sister.  I think this book would appeal to anyone feeling lost in their high school experience, adults who want to tap into the minds of high school kids and into their own high school memories.  This also makes a great rainy day book whenever someone is bored.<br />
B000024D4R|3.0|The members of Pink Floyd themselves have admitted throwing this album together in a very hasty fashion in order just to have some tour material.   This, coupled with other things, is why I give this album only three stars.<br />Pigs on the Wing parts I and II are both very good, short but sweet, songs.  A better version of the two combined can be download from the various places on the internet.<br />Dogs, Pigs (three different ones), and Sheep, the majority of the album, are all pretty much the same, which doesn't really present a problem if you like any one of the songs.<br />Moderately reccommended.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|It sure has been a while since I've heard a band who is so...talented. Well, at least they know how to use all of their talent to make such a good cd. This has been a problem over many years for me where I see bands like Radiohead or Pearl Jam, who are all capable of making such great music, but either writers block, or something happens else and the music isn't nearly as good as it should be. While I'm not comparing ATDI to them, It's like FINALLY! A band that uses what it's and makes a darn good cd. I like the flow of this, many songs start one place and end somewhere else in the span of like three minutes. Their use of techno beats and bongos really gives this cd depth and and sense of something different. Relationship of Command, more-so than their others (Vaya, etc) reminds me of the Science of Things by Bush. I know what you're thinking 'What?!?, they sound nothing like Bush!' but really if you listen to Science of things, and their use of the drum machine, and their (the bands) sound it does remind me of it (while Gavin sounds NOTHING like Cedric). There are so many qualities to this cd, such as Cedric's voice, or the arrangement of music, and of course the duel guitar playing. You've got one that plays power chords through most of the song, and one that does awesome intricate parts thoughout the song. I love it. <BR>There are quite a few great songs on here that stand out like \\"Arcarsenal\\", \\"Pattern Against User\\", \\"One Armed Scissor\\", and \\"Invalid Litter Dept.\\", but by far the best is \\"Cosmonaut\\". It starts fast and almost never slows down, truly amazing. Definately worth the money.
B000002U8G|4.0|I hold that this album is among the best that Pink Floyd has produced.  <br />While One of These Days is, in my opinion, one of there best songs.  Yet on this album, it is not nearly as good as the different version on the Delicate Sound of Thunder.<br />Fearless - San Tropez are all mediocre songs and are all very forgettable.  But three of the four stars of my review are from the 23 minute track Echos.  This is a simply excellent song very similar to those found on the first disk of the Delicate Sound of Thunder.
0553573403|5.0|First, I'll say that I don't usually read door-stopper series, simply because I can't find the time, and because I figure that most stories should be told in 1000 pages or less.<br />That said, I took GoT on a cruise last week on the recommendation of a friend, knowing that I'd have lots of time to read.<br />I was not disappointed.<br />There are several things about the book that made it so great (for me). First, the book is dark (or maybe grim is a better word). The story's setting is a place where human life is cheap, and respect is gained from fear. The author doesn't pull punches when describing such terrifying events as executions, murders or rapes. I guess maybe it helped me hate the bad guys all the more having knowledge of the level of evil they were capable of.<br />Second, I've not read any other book with political intrique that's been nearly as engrossing as this book. All the way through the book I found myself wondering who I should trust, and when the protagonist finds himself caught in a royal game of kings that he had almost no chance of winning (as the queen said, &quot;In the game of thrones, you either win or you die&quot;.)<br />Third, the book never lost pace. I've read epic stories before that were simply small stories with lots of extra bits wrapped around it. GoT told a story on every page, and surprised me in every chapter.<br />I'll need to take another cruise soon so that I can read the next book in the series!
B000002A3T|5.0|This album is among Pink Floyd's best.  And part of what makes this true is that the tracks don't just appeal to hard-core Floyd fans.  I know of people that like songs off of this album that would never listen to it if they knew it was Pink Floyd.<br />Creative genius - much like Dark Side of the Moon.  Highly Reccommended.
6305013578|1.0|I couldn't believe my eyes (and ears) when I started playing the DVD version of Fritz Lang's 1927 Metropolis (a 1998 Madacy Entertainment release). The image was shockingly miserable, badly out of focus and even off-centre -- parts of it were simply cut off. It looked it was filmed directly off the screen in some old cinema; the fourth-rate print used for the transfer must have been pulled out of rubbish somewhere. My 1-star rating of this transfer is still too high -- but no lower options are available.<br />It is really sad when a great classic can be butchered like this.
B000002UA5|1.0|Not unlike Atom Heart Mother, this album, quite truthfully and with all joking aside, [stinks].  I was not the least bit impressed or struck by this album at all.<br />Not reccommended by any stretch of the imagination.
0156012197|5.0|My mom bought me this book when I was about 10 years old. I liked the pictures and the story captured my imagination. It seemed special, especially since my mom gave it to me.<br />I read it again when I was about 16 and was blown away. I cried and cried. The insights I had gained between 10 and 16, I discovered, sat in the story, like little sparkling jewels half buried in sand.<br />I read it again when I was about 22.  Again, the depth of this little book surprised me, and again I was in tears.<br />The last time I read it, I was about 25 and felt no less amazement than before at the spiraling depths of this simple story.  (This book always makes me cry.)<br />This is a book that grows with you. The story is enchanting and contains within its pages so many precious lessons, like little secrets -- keys to life -- revealed to the reader in stages, as the heart and mind grows and opens enough to perceive them. This book is a pure treasure, and I recommend it for everyone, young and old. I look forward to reading it again... and again... and again.
B000006TRV|2.0|I consider myself to be a fairly large Pink Floyd fan. But, odd as it may seem, this album is one that I heard after all of the others.<br />Like the title of my review indicates, I hold that this album has only a few redeeming qualities.  While songs such as &quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Part II&quot; and &quot;Hey You&quot; would obviously be qualified as redeeming qualites, it possesses a few others.  Mother and Comfortably Numb are both enjoyable songs, as well as the short Vera, which, I personally would prefer to be a little, if not alot, longer.<br />I give it two stars because it is not anything like the musical genious portrayed in Dark Side of the Moon and a few of their other albums.  I would not go as far as to reccommend this album to anyone.
0679731725|5.0|Stevens is a butler so professional and refined that, on a week's drive through the countryside, people assume he is a lord.  In his account of the trip, he begins with a meditation on what it is that distinguishes a truly great butler from the rest, and the writing opens up beautifully into memories of his friendship with Miss Kenton, the housemaid, and some cracks of doubt about his previous master, a man who was deeply involved in &quot;great affairs&quot; before World War II. <br />The prose is impeccable and beautiful, written entirely in the voice of this fascinating character without a hint of the dramatic irony that becomes stronger and stronger, until the novel's heartbreaking conclusion when, all at once, evening has already arrived.
B00005NB0H|5.0|Most people looking at this will probably have listened to the old Live at Leeds, which is the best live album ever made. Thus you probably already own Live at Leeds, so the first disk is kind of redundant... but the second disk is most of Tommy, played live...simply incredible.
B00005N9CV|3.0|It's lush, gorgeous, lulling.  All the same, I miss how Diana and her trio used to COOK!  Every piece on this recording is a ballad, so the tone is consistent.  Everything about this collection is restrained....I'm sad to say that this is the most uninteresting CD that Diana has released.  I hope that her next recording is more like &quot;All For You,&quot; which I think is the best work of hers to date.
B0000508U6|4.0|The past two years have been that of the Radiohead soundalike - what with the breakthrough of Travis, Coldplay, and others. While it may be easy to dismiss them as watered-down versions of the original, they should not be tossed off as such--at least not after hearing their first effort. <br />They may lack the musical and lyrical complexity of their Oxford-based counterparts, but Coldplay have a knack for crafting tuneful, understated melodies, like \\"Don't Panic\\" and \\"Shiver\\", songs that are so mellow, you might fall asleep.  Indeed, this is mostly due to vocalist Chris Martin's distinctive, sweetly hypnotizing voice (a la Thom Yorke) that commands your attention and lulls you into repose.<br />The standout track on this album is the radio-friendly \\"Yellow,\\" a slowed-down, yearning lovesong that transports you to a lovely summer evening out under the sky.  The acoustic/electric guitar overdubs on \\"Yellow\\" harken back to Radiohead's \\"Bends\\" era and herald lovely things to come for Coldplay.<br />Some of the tracks are hit and miss, and the album on the whole is not greatly innovative or risky; it's just good, mellow Britpop.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Granted, I may be giving this movie 5 stars just so that &quot;hopefully&quot; it'll rise from an over all 3 and a half rating.  When I first seen the movie I thought it was ok.  I'm not sure why I even seen it because i read the book a while ago and thought it was just too darn strange.  One thing though that gives the movie power is the excellent soundtrack.  Really folks.. the soundtrack is outstanding.  Especially the the last two tracks.  The opera song i am especially fond of.  And when you add the soundtrack with the movie it just makes it a lot better.  I&quot;m a little concerned though with the intense glorifying of Lecter in this movie(isn't this the guy who tried to bite the face off a nurse?&quot; I enjoyed this film though in that the people Hannibal killed either we're trying to feed him to hogs or were arrogant fools (which, in the context of a movie can be a fun thing).  I do have the dvd and have since watched it 4 or 5 times.  I applaud Mr. Hopkins for being able to bring the menace back to his charcter.. with a lot more human emotion mixed in this time around.  Anthony Hopkins is great.
B00004XQ83|5.0|After seeing the movie, I just had to hear the music again.  I was not familiar with bluegrass before and I haven't seen much else that I would buy, but this album is terrific.
B00004Z400|5.0|much of today's hard rock has been tainted by wannabe acts such as &quot;limp bizkit&quot; or &quot;cold&quot;. when &quot;korn&quot; first appeared on the scene, i was mortified at the lack of quality on the harder side of the spectrum, which only seemed to yield more and more copy bands (yes, kids, &quot;limp bizkit&quot; and &quot;fred durst&quot; and their &quot;we're so angry&quot; attitude is a copy of &quot;korn&quot;, who is a really lame copy of Rage Against the Machine).<br />My years of listening to TOOL were getting a bit tiresome, until a friend exposed me to a little song called &quot;Passenger&quot;...<br />Hence, my love for the Deftones was born. an amazing album in every respect, the Deftones prove with their third outing that they're here to stay and shake up the hard scene. forget about lame lyrics (&quot;cold&quot;) or ridiculous attitude issues (&quot;fred durst&quot; is a businessman, not an artist, not a musician, not a singer in any respect), the Deftones bring it all back to a small little something that's worth listening to: sincerity.
B0000026J6|5.0|So Begins the second phase of Mr. Cohen's career. The penultimate folkie in the seventies, he has written several novels, had two seperate tribute albums praise his work, stole the show on the otherwise noneventful &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; soundtrack and had his lyrics endlessly quoted in love letters, studied in lonely bedrooms, and scribbled on countless high school notebooks. And deservedly so. As much a poet as a singer, and perhaps even more so, he has always carried a heavily literate heart and tempered it with exquisite beauty. &quot;I'm Your Man&quot; is a much more modern and fully developed album than his previous work. Songs such as &quot;First We Take Manhattan,&quot; and &quot;Everybody Knows,&quot; are surprisingly and affectingly eerie, flushed out with dark waves of synthesizers and strings. &quot;I'm Your Man,&quot; along with REM's &quot;Murmur,&quot; and Lou Reed's &quot;New York&quot; is one of the works that best document the gray despair of the Regan/Thatcher decade. Merging joyless romance and a smiling cynisism, Cohen's narrators never seem to find what they're seeking, whose small triumph's are quickly spoiled but oft remembered. Cohen's voice is famously average, but perhaps the only weaknesses on this record are the intrusive back up singers who seem like they would fit much better on a Jermain Jackson album. All in all a terrific album.
B00003CX5P|5.0|The Phantom Menace is a great start to an already great series of movies. The storyline starts to explain it all. Many have said that it does not live up to the original 3 but those people are looking for Han Solo, Chewbacca and the rest that we all grew to love. But without this story it leaves us wondering how it starts. How did Luke come to be? How did Obi-wan come to know Darth Vader? Well here it is in The Phantom Menace. An action packed story that starts it all. I for one am happy to own this movie and await the other 2 to come out. Thats why I give it the highest rating of 5 stars.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This is a strong candidate for my all-time favourite movie. I absolutely adore it. When I first began buying DVD's, I found, to my horror, that Forrest was not available. Why????, I asked. Now I know. The wait has paid off in a splendid DVD presentation, with extensive extras, all captivating. You want to know how they 'did' Lieutenant Dan's legs (or rather, lack thereof)? Buy Gump DVD and find out! You want to watch the beginning of Haley Joel Osmont's career? Grab Gump DVD, and check out his screen test!<BR>Forrest Gump is a movie that transcends both comedy and tragedy. He makes us cry; he makes us laugh; but most of all, he makes us think. I can't answer for what he'll make you think, but I know he will challenge you. His simple-minded, but big-hearted approach to life is inspiring like nothing else. Your life will truly never be the same once you've seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump.<BR>I've been disappointed by DVD's of my favourites (Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, Yankee Doodle Dandy). Finally, I have a DVD presentation to which I can finally respond... Yes.
B000002GYR|4.0|This is, I believe, Tom Waits' first album, and it was the first one I picked up. I had heard him sing a song on the Dick Cavett (SP?) Show on Nick At Nite and fell in love with that raspy voice (I still haven't figured out which album that was from...). That rasp is nowhere to be found on this disc. But, what is here is Mr. Waits' keen sense of language and melody. He would be equally at home laying down piano on a Coltrane tribute as he would guesting on Willie Nelson track. The songs are beautiful. Tom Waits is the only person I know who can get away with not sticking to one genre or idiom because he makes them all so much his own. <BR>The innocence on this album is somewhat lost on later efforts due to the harshness his voice picked up over the years ...but his inner voice never changes.
6305736650|4.0|Man alive, I hate not giving Casablanca five stars. It's among my favourite films. You can't beat dialogue like that! The characters are superp, the sets and costumes are superb, Bogie is wonderful, and Bergman rips my heart out everytime she walks into Rick's Cafe Americain dressed in that gorgeous white travelling suit... And then when she starts crying!!<br />I can't say enough good about the movie itself, and I won't try. It's already been said, by others more eloquent than myself. But I will dare to critique the DVD, nonetheless. But only the DVD...<br />Full screen format??? Come on, is it that hard to put it in it's original cinematic widescreen glory??? And what about extras? An entertaining documentary hosted by Laruen Bacall is a step in the right direction, but this is CASABLANCA, MAN! What about commentary? What about photo galleries? What about featurettes, and production jazz? Put some effort into it, for Pete's sake; it's only #2 on the AFI 100, and one of the finest films ever made!! I don't want to see trailers for Key Largo, I want to see another (longer) interview with Bergman's daughter. While you're at it, Warner Brothers, give some thought to Gone With the Wind. That's even worse. All it has is a trailer, and some ridiculous trivia questions. GONE WITH THE WIND!! I hope you're planning some kind of Special Edition Anniversary Collection with hours of extras. <br />Casablanca is timeless, it really is. You must buy this DVD, if only to remember the days when movies were acutally beautiful stories, not special effects extravaganzas spiced with plenty of gratuitous sex and violence. But save some pennies, because it can only be a matter of time before WB realizes it's atrocious error, and re-realeases Bogie-Bergman-Henried with the attention they deserve.
B00003CY0V|5.0|When i saw the previews of this movie, i thought the name was kinda goofy, but when i went and saw it at the movie theatre with my friends, i thought this movie kicked butt. it was awesome. basically, the movie is about a guy who is blackmailed into helping a high tech thief steal alot of money. the main character is Stanley, played by Hugh jackman, who i think is cool, and is hired by Travolta, who always plays awesome bad guys. the great things about this movie are 1) the action scenes and the way the film is shot with the different colored hues than normal lite gives it a high tech sweet look 2) the awesome car 3) the really cool beginning and ending, and 4) the most important : halle berry's amazing topless scene. any guy who saw this movie and thinks that scene is pointless, is the biggest nerd ever. this movie was an awesome guy movie, and anybody who wants to get an awesome movie to watch while drinking and hanging out with your friends, GET THIS MOVIE!
B00003CX9E|5.0|I must admit, I have been waiting for a DVD version of 'Citizen Kane' for as long as it has been since I saw the original! I applaud this choice!! This movie is a wonderful comebination of great camerawork (directed by Welles) and he is very powerful as well as the lead. The second disc that it comes with (The Battle over Citizen Kane) was great when we made copies of it for PBS at my work. It is a nice way to understand the whole film and the real-life results of the pseudo-life story of William Randolph Hearst. Citizen Kane also combines the urgency of needing to &quot;know&quot; about the keys to a man's life (i.e. 'Rosebud', etc.) as well as watching him rise to fame and then fall from grace. It is a film like no other that has since emerged from Hollywood, a true 5-star gem! If only the combination of quality script, excellent camerawork, direction and superb acting were as commonplace now as they were when 'Citizen Kane' was released, the world would be a better place!
