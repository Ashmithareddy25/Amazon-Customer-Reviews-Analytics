B003VNKLHA|4|The gait served its purpose to provide a barrier on a particularly wide stair case. Using all pieces together (note the instructions state not to do this) it is not super sturdy.
B000NAQADS|5|granddaughter loves it, fast shipping
B00511J6BM|5|This car seat cover is high quality & very practical. It keeps my baby boy warm & protected from the rain.
B0006FHB6A|2|I bought this for my 4month old for Christmas, I liked the pretty, bright colors and the sounds the foot pad would make.. she was a little small when I put her in, but nothing a thin blanket tucked around her for support wouldn't fix, and a pillow under her feet.  She wasn't heavy enough yet to push the foot pad to make noise, all of those things she would grow into though.  The part I couldn't over look though is how close all the toys were to her head and how hard the toys were.  She tried to chew on the see-saw (teething, everything goes to the mouth) and it was too hard and hurt her gums so crying she jerked her head back and bumped it on the mirror behind her.  It was a pitiful sight. Poor baby. I don't know why they didn't allow just a little more tray space  and curved that silly bar out more so they wouldn't bump their heads.  I think a little more thought put into the product and it could be a great toy, but as it is now I think it's just a little too \\"rough around the edges\\".  I took mine back to the store and then bought an Evenflo, she fits in it much better and so far she LOVES it.
B00CPC29YG|5|These are the best. Wish they were self cleaning.
B00J2P9WS0|5|for my friend,it's so cute
B002UD65RM|5|This material is nice and soft.  I washed and dried it per the instructions and it still feels great.  It fits our graco pack n play just perfectly.  This is way better than just a basic sheet.  It adds some extra cushion to the rough pad of the pack n play.
B00B7XUVLW|5|Love it!
B00HUDH17K|5|This is very cute and easy to put together. We used this over our Baby trend car seat that our son used previously. It gives it a cute personal touch. Our little on just arrived and it is still a tad warm out here in the desert region we live in. Therefore, we have not used the blanket or cover. It is quite a bit of pink, but still very cute and comfy.
B000069EXQ|5|Bought this for a 6 months old...don't know if there are any complaints for him, but nothing fromt he parents! haha
B008HCXIU2|4|The mirror holds its position fairly well. It is great to be able to check my little one while on the road.
B004DFO57M|5|These scissors were highly recommended to me by other moms, and they make the task of trimming my son's nails so easy.  They are gentle, and I have yet to cut him with them.
B0046N26YU|5|My little one loves it and we love that it can grow with her.
B000K4YSVI|5|We have been using this storage organizer with the Lansinoh bags.  It keeps the milk organized in the freezer and in order by date.  The spring loaded slot in the back of the organizer is really nice for freezing fresh milk vertical. Would recommend having one if you freeze breastmilk bags.
B00643FQVA|5|I have a 2 year old daughter that I nursed and I would have LOVED this set to get me started and provide much needed relief.  I am very happy to have it now as I am due in 8 weeks with our second child.  The best thing in the set are the gel discs!  I know I will be using them a lot in the first month.  They warm up nicely and contour well around the nipple without sharp edges to poke you, this will help with let down.  I liked how quickly they chilled in the fridge, starting at room temp, and will use them like this for soothing the fire nipples you get that first 2 weeks of breastfeeding, yowza!  This will be a great step up from the bag of frozen peas :)<br /><br />I like the bag it all comes in, handy for small items in your diaper bag.  The pin is nice too, you'd be shocked at how long baby brain lasts and it will help me remember which tata to use next.  This set would be the perfect shower gift for the new mommy planning to nurse her baby!
B00D2NCE3S|5|Absolutely the best value for the price.  All of this sold separately by Modela would have been so much more....  Extra valve membranes is wonderful...they always wear out quickly.  LOVE this package... It works very well.
B004S8MGHU|5|So I hesitated using this bra because it seemed like it took too long to put on, hook in the pumping parts, and start. But OMG I've wasted so much time! I always try to pump for 15 min and I think pumping is the absolute worst. The seconds just drag on. Then I sucked it up and started using this bra for work and omg...time flies! I can work (play) on the computer and actually do other things. I'm telling all new breastfeeding moms about this. This would be especially helpful at home if you have other kids as well.
B000056OUG|4|It's nice, quick, easy, and can hold alot. But the products only guarantees sterile bottles for 3 hrs after the cycle completes itself-- then what????  If you take them out, then there not sterile anymore.  But you have to take them out to do another load.  The bottles are soaked, so if you dry them there no longer sterile.  I'm confused as to how to dry and store the sterilized bottles.
B00U4L0D66|3|it was very uncomfortable to use I ended up just taking it off because I couldnt stand it.
B00EMK7F1G|2|Was way too tall for my daughter on the lowest setting. The music it plays is annoying and not catchy at all. My daughter wasn't interested in any of the toys and screamed the second I put her inside.
B00WANFS20|5|My neice loves them! She puts them on her bag so she can bring them anywhere.
B002WN2B6O|5|this sterilizer saves your time it's easy to handle and conviniant ...when i have to wash lots of bottles and sterilize them i used a pan i had to wait till the water boils and it take a long time i got to see this from Amazon and i purchased it yesterday it works fine and i love it...
B001CUPT76|4|I bought this stroller cover for our recent trip to Disneyland just in case it rained, It did end up raining so we put this cover to the test. It didn't fit all the way over our stroller. We have the Graco fast action fold stroller. The cover covered the stroller enough that our daughter and her stroller didn't get wet. I'm wondering if the cover would have fit better on our stroller if we had taken off the tray that goes in front of the stroller. The cover comes with a little storage bag so that you can fold up the cover and store it. All in all it's a heavy duty cover and it allowed us to shield our daughter from the rain but still allowed her to see what was going on around her.
B0085P4Z6M|4|Our 4 months old goes to anywhere with us because no one could help us to take care of him. So it is very important to have something bringing his milk conveniently. We tried couple stuffs before, we have to bring 1--2 empty baby bottles, one insulate bottle full of hot water, milk storage bags or containers every time. It is wonderful we have this now. We got it yesterday, and we start using it today. Now we only need to bring this one bottle filled with milk, no more other baby bottles and containers or bags etc. But one thing we are not quite satisfied is the plastic part of this bottle is a little poorly made, it is not smooth enough, I'm worried my baby's hand maybe get cut in the future if he use it by himself.
B00BVYWY5I|5|Darling, almost as good as Wubbanub!
B004C053CY|5|With my first child, we went thru 4 different brands of bottles (Avent, Playtex, Nuk, BornFree).  After countless leaks, pockets where milk gets trapped and spoils, gas issues, and cleaning nightmares, we decided to throw some money at the problem for our second baby.<br />Hail to the Comotomo!!!<br />Now, I haven't tried the Tommy Tippee brand.  Once I read the reviews for Comotomo I knew it was the bottle to beat.<br />I nurse and bottle feed so the shape of the nipple is perfection.  Baby took bottle from day one and we've never had an issue switching between the two.  We have been using the Comotomo's for 5 months.  They clean effortlessly and DO NOT LEAK! They are extremely well made and durable.  No issues with nipples or any other component of the bottle.  The flow is truely slow flow (we are on 2nd level nipple now), perfect for those who nurse and bottle feed.<br />The only and I mean ONLY obstacle with this bottle is the narrow base.  You have to be careful when making bottles.  No doubt about it.  I've only knocked it over a couple of times - that may have been related to sleep depravation as opposed to design.<br />Baby is already starting to hold her Comotomo bottles at almost 5 months.<br />Bottom line, buy the Comotomo.  You won't be disappointed.
B000BXAIDA|5|We can't imagine NOT having this item. The batteries last for approximately 2 weeks, with continued use throughout the day.     The only drawback that I think is when your strapping the baby in, the loud clicking noises that the straps make sometimes makes the baby jump a bit, which I really dislike.
B003I867US|5|Very nice way to stay close to your baby & great for zoo outings ect !
B002SV2L92|5|SOS soft and they fit so well. You can not have enough sheets. Would buy more in all colors, thanks
B004FPYFGG|4|I love the white minky dot. I agree this is not the thickest chair pad, but I have no complaints as to the comfort. We only purchased it because we needed something that would cover up a cosmetic issue with our rocking chair seat--a hole in the wood that happened during assembly. This chair pad cover served its purpose for us, and was more cost effective than purchasing a new rocking chair. I only gave it four stars because I think we paid nearly $60 for the chair pad, and it could be thicker. While I'm satisfied and I think the product is accurately represented from its description and photo, I don't want to mislead anyone who may be comparing prices or who may need a nice thick cushion (look on). I wanted the minky dot because our changing table cover in the nursery was also white minky dot.
B001HLFPMY|3|Very cute set sheets fit well and have a nice feel
B005NX677E|3|I didn't get a chance to use this product like I thought I would. It was always an after thought. It is easy to use and clean.
B004Q3LBTG|5|I wanted a baby food maker and based on the reviews this was the best choice. My parents were the ones who purchased it and gave it to me as a gift. I am glad I chose this baby food maker. All you have to do is chop the fruits or vegetables, and about 20 minutes late: TA-DA! Baby food! I love the recipes and the specifications regarding time for each fruit or vegetable that the book has. My favorite thing: it makes everything in ONE container so it's easy to clean. Buy it, you won't regret it. It'll make your life easier.
B003ZFPRHS|5|This is definitely a must-have for parents with babies! It's very handy when giving the tiny ones a bath and so much easier to get the right water temp needed. And this can grow with them too. Now my toddler plays with this toy every time he gets a bath. Fun times in the bath, thanks to this Ozeri Turtlemeter!
B004FH0U9A|3|I was just a little disappointed, both with how long it took to get here as well as what it actually looks like, kind of flimsy and doesn't fit snug around a beer can. However since this is for my husband to use when our son is born and there is limited time for that event, there is not time to find a replacement.
B000I2Q0F4|5|Excellent
B000N0SNHY|3|I've only bought one other brush to compare (Munchkins Bottle Brush) so I wound up purchasing the Dr. Brown Bottle Brush again.<br /><br />PROS<br />Soft bristles and the tip foam<br /><br />CON<br />Tip foam (because it is soft, it doesn't stay in tact)<br /><br />Munchkins foam was much more durable looking but the bristles were too harsh so I don't like using that one.  Even though the Dr. Brown bottle brush didn't hold up as well as I would've liked and is more money, I still liked it better than the Munchkins one because that one is just too rigid and tough but that's my personal preference.
B00CC9L1K0|4|Super cute! I thought the letters themselves were going to be a little bigger, but other than that very very cute!
B00380F4PU|4|Handy and coordinates with the ergo. Can also be used on its own. Seems good quality with several useful sections. I think it is a little small and also pricey though. Still, I like it.
B003LQOQB4|5|My twins love to hang out on this.  It is great for travel too.  We took it to Lake Arrowhead with us.  My twins did take the toys off the little pillow.  I hook them back up all the time, but they manage to pull them out.  No big deal, though.
B000BPS0P6|3|It's soft but a bit thin. I can see the print of the mattress through the sheet.
B00CWN8IK2|1|Hahahahaha! I'm laughing because It's exactly like everyone else here says. Works great while it lasts, but three months later, water starts leaking all over the place. Thank goodness I can still return it.
B005XTKHF6|5|...easier to pour the powder out of this one than the other cheaper products on the market. So worth buying!
B00FRS2C2E|5|My  PG step daughter thought it was the best gift she got.  &#34;Now I can sleep&#34;!!!!!
B00CLGZF6K|5|The hat fits perfect for my 6 month old and the blanket is thicker than expected. The delivery time was very fast.
B0057GU264|5|Perfect!!!-Not sure how we have done without this desk for this long.  Perfect for my 2 year old.<br />Very heavy and sturdy
B00007L5WU|5|The fleece is warm and good for the winter. The size large sack fits my one year old really well and she's on the bigger side. There is alot of room for their legs and to kick and roll over in the night. It's not binding but isn't too loose either. My husband has issues zipping it but I've never had a problem.
B000GB0NZK|1|the plastic on the top of this snack catcher is not good quality.  We used it once and a piece plastic from the top tore off; a major choke hazard.  Save your time and money, I won't be surprised to hear this product is recalled in the near future...  For a better option try the \\"snack trap\\", we used ours for 3 years not and no issues with the product breaking down.
B000246T54|2|Because the camera eye moves only in one direction, the device had to be permanently attached on a wall across baby's bed. You have to decide whether you want sacrifice the resolution to see the entire crib (older child can crawl away from the view) or see just a part of it. We have cell phones and wireless network so static was pretty bad. We went with Graco's excellent digital iMonitor.
B000K7IF1O|5|I am a father of two girls, and I would be lost without this product.  We bought one when my first daughter was potty training.  Let me tell you: I would NEVER let my daughters go potty in a public restroom, especially at such a young age.  And many times public restrooms aren't even available.  Everyone that sees ours always asks us where we got it and say they want one of their own.   The list of positives goes on and on, but you can check the other positive reviews as I agree with them completely.  Let me just add that we also have let nieces and nephews use it, ranging from 2 to 10 years old.  Also, my wife needed to use it in an emergency (on the road and no restrooms around for miles) and had no problems with spilling or making a mess.  So for the people who claim the opening is too small for boys of average size, maybe they're not using it properly.    Now, I have a huge complaint - why is this being discontinued?!?  We recently lost/forgot the bag at a rest stop in Ohio.  Checked around in stores and can't find it anywhere, including Target which is where the original was from.  I checked online at Walmart and they list it as discontinued.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  I'm hoping the message gets back to Fisher Price to keep making this product, or at least give up the manufacturing/copyright for it so I can sell it and make a fortune!
B0015CA3EK|4|I bought this for my 3 month old niece,  so far she is enjoying it,  fast shipping and product came without any damages,  it also came with a toy and mirror,  I am pleased with this item, would buy from this company again.
B004I68KEA|5|The first item was defective, but getting it replaced was easy and the new one is perfect. Thanks. I know my daughter will love using this for her daughter.
B00NO3Q7D4|5|Great Bag we love it.
B000MVQBG4|5|Love this storage basket! Don't have to worry about whether or not it will stick to the wall like all the others and it'll be easy to clean! Plenty of room to hold my daughter's bath toys and nice and easy for her to access (we don't use it for her soap though because of that same reason.)
B0081C9UOQ|3|I had to pry it open so I've only used it once thus my little guy doesn't know how to use it.
B002ONWJO6|5|These binkies are great and never get lost.  What a good idea!  Wish it had been mine.  Oh well. Kudo's
B002ZDFVP4|5|My daughter was able to rest at night with this knowing this bed rail was there. No falling out of the bed.
B00AMRTJXK|5|Great fabric, soft and perfect for my babys skin. It is a little bigger than i expected , so my baby will need to grow a bit to sleep wiyh it
B008LQD1EW|3|My pump bottles needed some. This says it's slow flow but I feel like it still comes out too fast.
B00AJSIUAA|1|The straps are too difficult to tighten. I believe that this seat is dangerous because of that. I would never recommend this seat.
B00B1J972G|4|these are great for keeping pre-folds closed. the dayglo color makes them easy to keep track of, especially at 3 am when your exhausted. Every once in a while one of three hooks will pop off or get snagged on something but this is a MUCH better alternative than pins.
B00KFU9HNG|5|Need more so it was easy to order more just want 8 oz bottle too for growing baby and great products.
B003854KVO|5|JUST TOOK IT OUT THE DRYER!!!<br /><br />PERFECT WITH THE SIMPLE HUMAN TRASH CAN.<br /><br />I USE IT EVERYDAY AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B000X26MMA|5|I bought this for my niece's new baby girl and had it engraved with her name so that she can keep it always.  My niece absolutely loved the set.
B001J5ZWKI|2|Super adorable with the set, and picture perfect. However after having it up, it's not sturdy, and winding, fell down a few times. I'm pretty easy on my things, and take good care of them but the wind up for music broke where it clicks, and won't play. My hubby took a look at it, can't be fixed, my 9 month old has a lullaby player now, because I completely took it down. Too bad.
B003HS5JRG|5|My son loooooooves this toy! He stares at it and likes the sound it makes. I took this on a trip to Peru and all my family used it as a stress reliever for some reason haha anyways it's an excellent buy!
B007700SD0|5|Great product!  I have several Taggie brand things for my 7 month old little girl and she just loves them.  This is the perfect cart cover and it's a little big for the high chairs, but works well, nonetheless, with keeping her clean and entertained.  I especially like that the lap strap covers most of her belly, which keeps her more secure in the cart or high chair.  Well done, Taggies!
B008DDPLEG|3|my daughter spend more time taking this thing apart than actually using it! both the seat and the bucket come apart with way too much ease! Must monitor your child otherwise you'll have big messes on your hands! Also the batteries died within a few weeks.
B008C02AYO|5|excelente
B008FY37NU|5|My 5 month old loves this!  We have 2, one for home and travel :)
B006Z6E80Q|5|This freezing tray is awesome! I use it with my FreshFoods baby food maker and one full prepared mixture will fill this tray almost perfectly. (2 pears/2apples/2avacado etc) Each little cube is about 2oz which is great for just starting my 6 month baby on solids as thats just about what he'll eat in a sitting. I'd like to add that this tray is more for just freezing the food and then you need to transfer it to a freezer bag once frozen because the lid it comes with is just for stacking purposes and does not create an airtight seal. So that being said you shouldn't worry about the cubes being small as you can just unfreeze multiple cubes as your baby needs more food. I find the cubes REALLY easy to pop out for most foods but when I made avacado I had to get my husband to pop them out because it was just way too hard for me. Overall I'm extremely happy with my purchase and would definately recommend this to a friend. I will probably end up buying another one down the road as well so I can freeze multiple meals at once.
B001OC5UNK|2|One of my childcare children crashed into this and cut there head on the metal part.  I had to take it down and throw it away.
B0045I6IA4|5|Wasn't sure I could get these anywhere, but was so happy to see them online, since the one that she got when she was born was almost MIA yesterday and that can be a problem with an infant.  So stocked up on these and love the different colors. only downside is that everything gets stuck to the material the paci is made of, so constantly washing off fuzzies/hair
B0042D69UG|4|Super cute, my boys love them. Quality could be a touch better but for under $15 you can't expect to much. One buckle broke during installation but it wasn't an essential one.
B007A2ZSZ8|5|yep hey are awesome went through three other brand locks and finally one my 2 and half year old can't open and my 55 year old husband cant yank off and break in the middle of the nite!
B0019526XE|5|Will be great for making homemade baby food. Have not tried it yet though.
B004CL9YHS|5|I bought 3 to block all stairs. No need to ruin walls with screws, no need for complex installation, very easy to use, I love it!
B00M1Y5ARG|5|Packaged great. My wife has the same exact model, color so I loved it. Easy to install, and great quality. Watch YouTube videos for installation.
B0013FL0ZA|5|I have been using a plastic covered wire basket in my dishwasher for years.  Unfortunately, the plastic tends to tear in the wash and the exposed metal then becomes rusted.  After burying my third dishwasher basket, I set out in search of a basket that wouldn't rust.  I thought it was a bit odd that the only dishwasher baskets that came up via a search on Amazon were in the \\"baby\\" section but I was not dissuaded.<br /><br />I purchased the \\"Toddler\\" size basket and it lives in my dishwasher.  It is longer, but thinner, than the wire baskets that I've had in the past but I like this size better--I can fit a wider variety of things in it which makes cleaning up after myself that much easier.<br /><br />What goes into the basket: small \\"Tupperware\\" lids, small plastic measuring cups, plastic measuring spoons, sport bottle tops, travel mug lids, teeny-tiny bowls, shot glasses, small spatulas, cat food lids, canning jar gaskets.  And the list goes on.  There is something in the basket every time I run the dishwasher because there is always something small that needs to be washed.<br /><br />What does a dishwasher basket do: it keeps small dishwasher safe items from being blown around during the wash cycle, saving them from the wrath of the heating element as well as possible breakage for the small glass/porcelain items.  This basket does a fine job.  Everything gets shiny clean and nothing gets damaged--a true win.  The only \\"con\\" is that, because of the width of the basket and lids, pet food lids need to be placed carefully to keep them from getting stuck between the side rungs.
B00GJ4QTRE|4|Was having such a hard time with Medela and these are a life-saver! I am exclusively pumping so I needed something better!! Only one problem - realized the air dry bag was not sewn properly and everything was falling out but I can't return my product to replace because I had already started using the flanges.
B00067TA1W|5|We registered for this mattress with the former pattern (but still the Sealy Baby Soft Ultra) and couldn't be happier with it. It was actually only 59.99 then - summer of 2003 - but 69.99 is still a great price for a good mattress. <br />We have used it every night for 19 months (luckily our daughter is a good crib-sleeper) and she sleeps very comfortably on it. When I see how much some other mattresses are it seems like a waste of money. We have had ours in a vinyl protective cover, also from BRUs for 6.00, so it is in perfect condition. <br />We are expecting our second baby in June and bought a used crib and mattress for him on e-bay...unfortunately the mattress is smelly (although originally very expensive at $200) so I immediately went back to my registry and added this mattress again!
B00INS1I70|5|They look great!
B00GUN3Z1W|1|Opened the box and nothing was in there
B00EU74O1A|5|I love this diaper! It really does agitate the insert out in the wash which was my main motivation for buying it! I have tested this on every rise setting so there's not even a need to unsnap the rise. Making it ideal for sitters (and dads!) the double gusset is a nice feature too! Will definitely be buying more of these in the future. I currently only have four and they work great for overnight dipes. Side note: these would PROBABLY fit most babies right after the cord stump falls off. It would give a newborn major fluffy butt but if a newborn stash isn't in the budget these would do the trick IMO my baby wasn't overly large either born at 6lbs 15oz. Overall love this diaper very budget friendly and easy for anyone to use. One of my faves in my stash I def like these more than my bum genius (though that is also an excellent diaper!) I just like these a bit more!
B004J4VXXG|5|I like these 'cups'! Despite the bad reviews the price was right and I figured if I had problems with the lids I'll deal with it! They work well!! I washed them in the dishwasher on the top rack, they where not deformed. I have not had any issues with the lids. I use them to store small portions of food for my 8 month old twins. I open them frequently throughout the day. I have even placed them in the freezer. They work so well I would buy more!
B00GUN3Z1W|5|Good product!
B0042D69YC|4|Full disclosure: I am 37 weeks pregnant (and therefore, fully at the mercy of both baby brain and nesting issues) and decided to put this together by myself. I feel the assembly was much more challenging than it needed to be -- it is just a bouncer.<br /><br />A couple suggestions:<br /><br />First, put the batteries in. The instructions have you fully assemble the bouncer, and then have you disassemble it to put in the batteries. Taking it apart is easy -- save that for when you need to wash it (which appears will be very easy and handy). You would probably realize this before you got the thing fully assembled. I did not. If you're like me and didn't think about this first, being told to take it apart would make you want to chuck it in the lake, too.<br /><br />Second, the directions leave out some key information. Like most instruction manuals, there are images. They aren't helpful -- for instance, the images do not show how things angle, or indicate things angle in ways they do not. Common sense would win out for most of you, so you'll probably figure these details out without too much trouble, but for those of us who do not have any common sense at this time, the Seat Back Tube will angle back, not up. And the Base Wires will angle out, not back (these were fairly simple -- there's no other way to fit them into the Base Tube). In addition, the instructions do not indicate exactly what they mean by &#34;Retainer Socket Up&#34;. These plastic devices are the devices in which the Toy Bar will fit. Therefore, the hole in the things (not the section where the Seat Back Tube goes), needs to be facing out.<br /><br />Finally, certain components don't &#34;tighten&#34; the way I thought they would. Specifically, the Feet. It appears this is for a gentle vibration, but it would have been nice if the instructions had indicated this. I felt they should tighten further.<br /><br />Again, you'll probably have an easier time of it, but if you're like me (way too pregnant to be able to comprehend directions but determined to do it yourself like a typical toddler), I hope these tips will help.<br /><br />I still gave it four stars because it's adorable, and based on recommendations from friends, this will be an essential little chair when the little one is here. I do suspect I'll wish the music will play longer. (BTW, if you want the music to stop even faster, switch it to one of the animal noises -- those last only for seconds. Don't keep cycling through looking for the &#34;off&#34;. There doesn't appear to be one.)
B008VUB8ZM|5|I received a Padalily arm cushion as a gift, and discovered that Padalily also makes canopies.  I ordered one right away in a coordinating fabric, and it looked adorable as a set.  The best thing about their canopies is that they can velcro into the Padalily arm cushion loops making it easy to use the Padalily cushion while still using your canopy.  It's a genius design - and I get compliments wherever I go.  People are always asking me where I got the set!
B007MCQA9O|1|This is THE WORST video monitor EVER.  I could go on and on about what a disappointment it was right out of the box but held off because I had a newborn and a 2 year old and no time to sit and rant when my days were consumed with getting either or both to sleep... but I digress...<br />Eight months pass and the worst monitor ever decides to go ka-put.  Just up and stops working for no reason at all.  Okay, wait, I shouldn't exaggerate... only one of the 2 cameras gave out--the one that happens to be in my baby's room (aka THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE).  Sure it was a fluke.  But seriously, I hate this monitor so much I think it did it on purpose.<br /><br />Top 10 reasons to hate this monitor overall (in order):<br />10. Remember those sketchy pixelated 80's security cam stop motion videos that were so grainy you wondered how they caught the guy? Yeah, this is worse.<br />9. The battery life.  This is a misnomer.  Think \\"battery life support.\\"  The second you unplug it, no matter how long it has charged, you get maybe 45mins until you hear the dreaded low battery beep.  This is the monitor version of someone coding in a hospital.  You need to rush in, ideally with a team of people who know the monitor cord's most recent location and the nearest outlet, so that you can revive the monitor STAT.  Sometimes you win, and keep the main monitor going for a little longer.  Sometimes, well, you have to go into the next room where the camera monitors are, take off your mask, and slowly shake your head.  There was nothing you could do.  There just wasn't time.  So don't plan on taking the monitor outside with you or anything.  Patients in the ICU shouldn't go on walks.<br />8. The beeping.  Oh my GAWSH the BEEPING!  For every little stupid thing this idiot monitor beeps warnings so loud it often disturbs the sleeping babe in the next room.  I understand that you want to know if you lose connection...but when it loses connection multiple times an hour at random, when nothing has moved in either location, my patience wears thin.  Imagine you have finally gotten two kids to sleep.  You crawl into the living room, sink into the couch, hoping for fifteen minutes of the rest you remember from long, long ago.  You pour a glass of wine, check the monitor again and put it down next to you.  Your muscles relax, you draw in a deep breath, and...BEEP BEEP BEEP.  It's lost connection. No, wait, it found it again.  Ahhh...BEEP BEEP BEEP.  Lost connection.  Wait, I thought it found the connection, just a moment ago?  What Motorola hasn't told you is that the main monitor and the camera monitors aren't on speaking terms. Turns out the camera monitors are passive-aggressive, so they tend to get really defensive just when the main monitor wants to talk.  You are now a part of this broken family dynamic.  Welcome.<br />(Note: There is no way to turn all the beeps off--just the one that tells you it's going to die.  Then it dies on you and you have no idea).<br />7. Someone reviewed that you \\"get what you pay for.\\"  You do not.  I did not pay for this thing, and I regret the zero dollars. I could have done it pioneer woman style with no monitor and been less frustrated.<br />6. The \\"switching camera\\" feature.  This monitor doesn't have a side by side view, it \\"switches between them every few seconds.\\"  This isn't the end of the world, but it doesn't switch directly from one to the other.  In between, you will enjoy anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds of black text on a white background, reading \\"Switching to Baby Camera 1.\\"  So if you hear a thump in your little one's room, get comfortable, because you won't be seeing what's going on in there for a while.<br />5. The talk-back feature.  You press and hold the \\"talk\\" button.  In case you holding down the very large button wasn't enough of a clue, the picture goes away and the word \\"Talk\\" shows up, in the black text on white background to which you've become so familiar.  So say your piece fast if you want to know what's going on in there.<br />4. The video quality.  It's so terrible I have to mention it again.<br />3. It says it's a color monitor.  It isn't.  Even in the brightest daylight it uses night vision. Liars.<br />2. If you own a computer, or a television, or a radio, or a cell phone, you're going to want to keep that on the other side of the house from this thing.  It needs its personal space to function.<br />1. It stopped working after 8 months.  Unacceptable at any price.<br /><br />There you have it.  You have been not only warned but saved from an added frustration on top of the daily real challenges of raising kids. You're welcome.  Motorola, no thank you and never again.<br />The End.<br /><br />PS I was forced to give it at least 1 star to \\"rate\\" it on Amazon but really it deserves NO stars.
B000056HK2|5|My baby loves getting changed because this thing is so comfortable. You can also buy different color covers for it, which look really nice. The sides are also higher then the other changing table pads out there which is great.
B002SG7JGM|1|Bought this for our Labrador puppy. After opening the package, however, it went straight into the garbage. Cheap material and the tag says &#34;Made in China&#34; although the Amazon product information lists the country of origin as Thailand.
B001JEOG9M|5|Perfect for the bath tub.  If your child is under 2, watch out for them chewing on the pieces.  Very educational. My son learned the different types of cars and trucks.
B00GL6CT7E|2|So helpful to have these holders, keeps the pacifie close by.
B00EVD73UC|4|Got the job done at the right price. Good size too.
B009IWNPXK|4|I originally bought reusable pouches for my homemade purees but as expected they were hard to clean. Bought these thinking I would be filling them like the reusable ones (slit at the top so you can spoon in the food) but it turns out they have to be filled through the spout you eat from. Didn't feel like buying the Squeeze Station which seemed like one more thing to clean and take up space, so I figured out I could fill them w/a turkey baster. I've heard of others using food grade syringes as well. Took longer but I set aside a few hours every so often to make large quantities of food anyway so a few extra minutes wasn't a big deal. Overall these are really cute and convenient for feeding while out and about. I will continue buying them and using my method for filling. I would recommend these.<br /><br />**Update-after using my method of filling on 3 different occasions I broke down and bought the Squeeze Station and I'm glad I did. Isn't as big as I thought it would be so I can easily store it in the closet. Takes a lot less time to fill the pouches and isn't very time consuming to clean. Overall I love the whole Infantino system. Also bought the spoons to go with the pouches and they are awesome. I have 2 other brands of pouch spoons and these are the best...the hole is much bigger so it's easier to get the food out. Others I have the hole is small and only very runny foods will come out of them.
B005J58CV0|5|very good.
B000YHC6ZQ|3|I really wanted this because my 14 month old son keeps flinging his sippycup off his high chair. This unfortunately did not solve my problem, because a) he yanks this right off the cup and b) even when he doesn't do that the rope isn't long enough for him to drink from the cup. It does work well for toys and snack containers though.
B006OJIK44|4|Works great and as advertised. I had a weird spot on the stairs that no other gate could install on, but this one could. It opens and closes with ease and is secure. I'm not giving it 5 stars purely based on the poor quality of the instructions.  It felt like it was written by people who expect you to already know what every piece is and how to install it on your own. I got the job done, but there was moments where I kept wondering if I was installing the gate properly, which isn't exactly comforting when the idea that a poorly built baby gate would result your baby falling down the stairs.
B000U5LXU6|5|My house has a lot of stairs, then I been bougth three of them.  They are really useful, and my 19 months son doesn´t climb or open it.  It's really a safety barrier
B000SEVCRI|3|The magnets barely work
B007F8SDY0|5|This is the best mattress pad I have seen ever! Soft, cushion and supportive!
B0018Z35DA|1|My daughter loved this thing, but it crapped out in less than 6 months.  The remote control never worked on it either.  Very poorly made product.
B0006BAJNG|5|Perfect for storing liquids with Dr.Browns Bottles. This was a necessary buy after I mistakenly bought baby bottles. I'm glad the caps were cheap and sealed the bottles well.
B00SI2ESVO|5|works as expected
B002AAT31A|5|Super cute and exactly what we were looking for
B000IDSLOG|5|Goes great with the book!
B004W7VUOM|3|Description says they are 11 inches and they are really closer to 10 inches.  They would be good for younger kids clothing but for kids starting to grow out of the small hangers they don't work so well.
B007CGNMSW|4|It is a very nice looking high chair. We are very happy with this purchase.<br />The only disadvantage is the design of the tray. It has two not-removable pieces attached on both sides to constrain the baby legs (?), and my 17-months boy can already barely fit in there.
B00389VFH2|5|One refill lasts around a month in my house. I haven't had any problems with tearing and we pack each bag FULL!
B00OFD95A4|5|For my grandson, but he's still a little short for it.
B000CRFOWK|1|We purchased this since our 3 week old seems to be soothed by the vibrations in other products, and liked the fact that the vibrations could be triggered to start automatically if he awoke during the night and did not need a feeding. (our daughter slept in her swing for 9 months <br />). The unit vibrated when we installed the batteries, however when we placed the unit on the crib, the vibrations never worked, but would work when you removed the vibrating unit from under the mattress to repostion it. <br />
B008VS7WAY|5|we got these to use with pretty much every baby accessory we own. they were hanging on the floor mat to look at first then the baby started grabbing them to play with. now they get taken every where. one of our most used toys since they crinkle, rattle, teeth, and hang. they work well in stages since they are brightly colored for early viewing by drawing attention. they are nicely sized for little hands and have lots of spots to chew on. plus they have a bunch of different textures for feeling and chewing. great all around toy.
B001RJUVS4|5|I bought 2 of these for a few roadtrips with my small boys. This mug is great! Neither of my boys, 2 and 4, have been able to spill anything with this mug. Unlike the snack trap which they both figured out within an hour. They love that I can hand them this mug at the park and they can hold onto their snacks the entire time they play, slides and all. The only downside is that I feel it is a little too expensive, at least for me. If I hadn't had a few amazon gift cards I'm not sure I would have purchased them having never seen them in person in use, but I am very happy that I did. I definitely recommend this mug!!!
B004IEBSSW|3|too heavy. not for nyc . i can not use it myself. it is impossible for me to lift it upstairs or downstairs. my baby hates it. seldom use it. In the end, i gave stroller to a friend.<br /><br />the carseat is better. but it became too small when my baby is only 5 months old! the only lucky thing is we are in nyc and we do not drive to our ped.
B00021D1GC|3|I think this well enough but the scent is a little overpowering. It's not a bad smell but just stronger than I would prefer.
B00BJ8G1OQ|5|I am happy with this purchase, at list if my baby watching Tv (can not avoid that) she will see something that makes her happy. She loves the dvd's and she get exited everytime we play it....
B007QXTP0K|3|These are good for a while, then it's leaky and annoying always cleaning up after shaking or feeding and turning upright.
B00JBYNKWG|5|Wish I had bought this sooner. It was a bit spendy for a baby tub, but I LOVE all things that can grow with my son so I figured it was okay. I wish I had just gotten this tub to begin with. It has a sling for newborns and converts all the way up to toddler. My guy is almost 8 months old and in the 50% of height and weight and he's using the sit me up support. He's just getting the hang of sitting up right but kept trying in the little folding sling seat we had for him before.<br />This let's him have his hands free to splash and grab at stuff and helps him stay witting, he has a little room to grow and it's not a snug fit, but he's supported enough that he doesn't topple over or float out of the green seat.<br />I REALLY like this tub and would recommend just going for it when shopping for baby items. It's completely worth the price.
B0012S5HRU|5|This was a baby gift and it is amazing.  To be using something so natural for a baby is a great thing!
B00IQBQHSY|4|Really cute bag and very nice design. The key hook is a plus makes keys accessible. The bag is deep but fills up quickly. don't like that bag doesn't have a zip top closure, my baby items get lost inside.I currently use as a park diaper bag for my kids to store just in case items like diapers, bug spray, wipes and snacks
B001HTG0NO|3|But a little back heavy, and it came with a red trim, which is NOT what the picture shows. I would have gave it another star if the color was what was pictured. Wishing it had an option to buy a specialized canopy, thinking about buying one, but unsure if it will be compatible. Will update when/if I find a suitable canopy... Could have been shipped out a little faster too... and on a side note I opted for an organizer and I do know this one is great and compatible http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X2HC9W/ref=oh_details_o06_s01_i02?ie=UTF8&psc=1
B00095LILQ|2|Wifey loves it, very useful. I give it 2 stars because it should come with a stroller this expensive. Ridiculous to penny-pinch customers like this.
B000LZFZVS|5|This product is quality we really liked me and my wife this will look good on my unborn child this, I hope to continue buying in the future with amazon
B003U9V1BA|5|We love this high chair! We live in a small townhouse, so getting a high chair that was sturdy and compact was our goal. We have a TINY dining area and were disappointed with the collapsable high chairs we looked at. They were either cheap or ugly or didn't really fold flat. We had pretty much settled for another chair when a co-worker told me about the Joovy Nook, and we are so glad she did!<br /><br />We got the green chair, which unlike the Amazon pictures, actually is a pleasant lime green instead of yellowish. Setting it up initially was very easy, and directions were clear. The straps are simple to adjust, and we could tell right away that this was a high chair that folds up flat, was very study, and made of high quality materials. The removable tray cover is a nice option for people who would like to remove the surface to soak or put in a drying rack. Our daughter always seems comfortable in it, and there is plenty of padding on the back and bottom of the seat.<br /><br />The best thing about this chair is how easy it is to fold flat and open to a useable position. This is the only piece of baby gear that I have ever used that you can truly collapse or open with one hand. I can collapse it flat or open it easily with my very chunky baby in one hand.<br /><br />We highly recommend this high chair!
B00BLY1M6K|5|We have a senior Dachshund with serious back issues.  Upon recommendation of our vet, and much research, we decided to give this mattress a try.  My husband built a frame and a ramp for the bed to discourage jumping from the bed.  I made pillowcases for the mattress with fabric I had on hand rather than buy baby bed sheets.  Our Dachsund loves the bed and is much improved.  Our Corgi loves it as well.  They each have their own end of the bed as it is so roomy.  It would accomodate pretty much any size dog.  Our top recommendations!!!!!
B009W24ZBC|5|Bought this for grandson.  Was able to get it engraved in Chicago while visiting there for the Christening.  Needed to be hand engraved.  Though pewter would be better than silver because of tarnishing factor.
B008NDC86K|5|This is a nice carseat, have been using it for a couple months now. The baby seems comfy in it, but do wish it reclined a little more (rear facing). We put a rolled up towel under it but his head still flops to one side when he is sleeping. Not really sure that any other seat would be better? Easy to adjust and load/unload. way easier to buckle/loosen straps than our previous graco snugride 35! In any case, it will be forward-facing soon enough so won't be an issue. Did see it for about $15 cheaper at costco, but not in the color I wanted.
B002FB7FH8|5|The Thirsties duo wrap has worked great. I recommend velcro closures as opposed to snaps. The velcro gives you more flexibility. Snaps don't always line up and they can either be too lose or too tight. The material is waterproof but breathable as they claim. The gussets around the legs are great. They help make sure you have a good fit and minimize leaks. I have also used a different diaper cover and it had snaps, no gussets and was not breathable so I definitely recommend all these features of this product. I wasn't sure about doing cloth diapers though I really wanted to try.  At this point my baby is 3 months old and he only poops once a day.  It is SO easy to change the inserts in the diaper wraps, rinse them out and set aside to launder.  It saves money on disposables and helps the environment.  There is a sprayer that you can attach to your toilet that makes spraying poop off the cloth diaper and into the toilet fairly easy too.  I recommend giving this diaper system a try, its great.
B000IDSLOG|5|Baby picked it up quickly and started biting it and loved it.  Must have for your babies.  Great buy worth it.  Great material
B00QXI0T3G|5|This blanket looks exactly like the pictures, except the ribbon is not part of the blanket! :) Like it a lot - even softer than expected.
B00IUYFX3W|2|I am very disappointed with my purchase - the side baskets are ripped and falling apart and the back straps seem to be going in a similar direction.... I wish it had warned me that it was to be used as a very light weight bag, probably just day packing--- as I am now having to invest in a regular backpack.. and i waited to long to try to return (you know how things are with a baby) and I can no longer return it.... If I did it again, I would've gotten a regular backpack from the start and just inserted a changing pad, pouch for warm bottles, etc....
B00HPD4V1Y|5|I love these so much I ordered more! I make smoothies for my baby to sneak in extra veggies and take on the to. Cleaning them is certainly not difficult as long as you have a bottle brush. I love the safe material, not creating so much waste with the disposable and the zipper is much much stronger than I had anticipated. I was a little worried about them bursting when I froze them, but so far so good! Great product!
B00AQCRME4|3|They are good if your toddler isn't going to touch them. Otherwise, try getting something with reinforced tape. These only lasted a couple of days. My toddler peeled them off of our entertainment center and now they are among her heap of toys. We put them back on, but the tape isn't sticking anymore. Plus, it left marks on our corners. What a shame, since we really need the protection.
B00BI2VL7U|1|This Nuby shampoo rinse cup is difficult to hold, and doesn't hold enough water.  I've ordered my 2nd Kidzkamp shampoo rinse cup as a result.
B006J02T72|2|Decals do not stick well to the textured walls and most fell off within the first 24 hours. I did place a couple of the decals on the smooth doors and those decals are still holding well.
B0013O9RX8|4|As someone who commutes on the subway every day with a laptop, I needed a small, lightweight breastpump, and this really fits that bill.  I also love the hands-free straps so I can keep working on my computer while I pump.    A few minor warnings - issues not hard to resolve:  - The SoftFit breastshields that came with the system sometimes caused chafing.  I got Medela's hard breastshields and had no problem.  - Careful about doing too much with the hands free system - you have to keep your chest upright.  If you bend over the milk will leak out.  - Sometimes when I turn the unit on there is no suction.  This means the pieces of the pumping mechanisms weren't snapped together properly.  If you take it apart and reassemble it should work fine.
B000MF6V1K|3|Absolutely love the product. Never had these for my 4 year old, because she is very careful and tidy. But my 2 year old boy? VERY GLAD TO HAVE IT FOR HIM!! I was shocked the package only had ONE holder, but he can only drink on juice at a time, so it's all good. I just figured I'd let everyone else know...read the fine print! 5 star for product. 1 star for deceptive photo. Average: 3 star
B00FPDAVYC|5|Always love the JOTO film. I have purchased this for other tablets and it always applies well and look good.
B005PBOQEA|5|GOOD
B0036ZBG7W|5|Love it! Way bigger than I was expecting! So worth the price and the wait since it was out of stock when i ordered it.
B000LBDE8S|4|I love this walker for it's fun looks. Our 6-month old loves it as well. The music is fun and the steering wheel is great. My only complaint is that i wanted the wheels to lock so it would become a stationary activity center for when we are in our bi-level great room. It is sturdy though and can be adjusted for height easily.  <br />
B00LWUW7XA|5|Great product!
B001ECHXVC|5|The only thing that would make this better is if it folded to make is smaller and easier to store otherwise it is great.
B0057ECYS0|1|I'm at my wits end here. I received one of these as a gift off of my baby registry. 2 weeks after I started using it, it inexplicaply stopped working. I then had to ship it back to Amazon before I was able to order another. I mistakenly ordered the same item again instead of buying another brand and literally 10 minutes ago...I took it out of the box followed the set up instructions again...and it's not working!<br /><br />I've been sterilizing everything on my stove top with a big pot of boiling water and I'm FURIOUS that the 2nd one is defective as well. DON'T BUY THIS! It looks great but if it doesn't work, what's the point???
B001OC5UNK|5|its great, just what I needed to keep my little one safe from the kitchen area! I recommend it highly
B0057Y4EX8|4|I was looking to get a swim diaper that I could wash and re-use instead of continually buying disposable swim diapers.  I bought the 2XL for my 2 year old that is just over 30 lbs.  They were too tight!  She wore them a couple of times and then started complaining that it was too tight and so I was forced back into disposable swim diapers for the rest of our trip.  I should have ordered these earlier so that I could have returned them for a different size.  However, they look great and seem to work well at containing messes as they are snug fitting around the waist and legs.  So, provided you get the right size, I think these are a great pick for a swim diaper.
B0057L8UOU|5|My daughter adores her mobile! Great Price. So glad I bought it.
B00474CUTO|3|I bought this because the weight of my belly during pregnancy was making it very uncomfortable for me to sleep. This wedge pillow didn't give me any kind of support. I did use it after my baby was born to help prop her up so she could sleep better. And I passed it down to another pregnant friend so I think it served its purpose.
B003I8687A|5|It's awesome great size and I love that you can fold it up and hide it away. Great price too!
B0041IYOG8|5|We tried many different slings & carriers and the ergo seems to be the best for both mom and baby. for me, its not only comfortable to wear, its pretty easy to get on even without your partner. It also gives me peace of mind baby isn't going anywhere! He's safely strapped on. And he seems to really enjoy it. It didn't work very well for us when he was a newborn (even with the insert) at first though - but got much better once he hit about 15 pounds. A must for when he has the nighttime fussies, I strap him on and walk around the block and it frequently helps him fall asleep.
B000B6MKTC|4|We began with the typical audio monitors, but upgraded to video once we entered the 'cry it out' stage.  I recommend this monitor to all my mommys-to-be, because I love being able to see WHY he is crying...is a foot caught?  has he vomited?  is he just being stubborn?  Our 'camera' is in an upstairs bedroom, and the monitor is downstairs.  There IS a bit of interference, but I think no more than can be expected, expecially in our neighborhood with house alarms, garage door openers and the like so close together. <br />Well worth the money.
B00081J3N6|5|these handy plugs kept our house safe for our 13 month-old grand-baby.  Easy to put in and remove when she is not here...a good grandparent item.
B004X0WBHS|5|a good product as expected and very good would that offered a gift for each product purchasing and so motivate more users 100% recommend this particular product
B004S8MGGQ|5|This is the best hands free pump bra ever!!!
B003ZC8B1K|4|Great product, worth the money. Seller was prompt with service and delivery.
B00186ZQUO|4|We have had this bottle warmer for a week or two, and are very pleased with it.  I read other reviews on Amazon before purchasing it, and despite the variability of the reviews, got it and am happy that I did.<br />I don't get overly concerned about how hot versus warm versus \\"not cold\\" it makes the bottle. We are giving our daughter both pumped breastmilk and formula, and I wanted something faster than microwaving water and the setting the breastmilk in it for 3-5 minutes to warm it and re-suspend the fat of the milk. My goal is that it's not refrigerator cold when I give it to my daughter, although she will take a straight from the fridge bottle of formula when she's really hungry.<br />I selected this warmer to purchase because of all of the ones I looked at, this one was the fastest - shortest time it advertises is 90 seconds, versus 5+ minutes for some other brands.  I purchased it from Amazon because of the great price (and we have Prime so fast & free shipping).<br />As other reviews have said, the beeping is loud.  It doesn't really bother me, nor does it seem to bother her.<br />I have used the pacifier sanitizing feature - I do like that option as my daughter has a talent for spitting her pacifiers pretty far when she is done with them.<br /><br />I will say -- we use the Playtex Ventaire Bottles for formula.  These bottles have a large plastic disk at the bottom (for the air vent) and the disk does get quite hot from the warmer, even when the milk is just warm.  However, since I am wiping the steam off of the bottle with a towel/paper towel anyways, I just avoid handling the very bottom of the bottle and it cools very quickly.  We don't have this issue with the breastmilk in the plastic Medela bottles, as they have plain/normal bottoms.<br /><br />We have not had to descale the warmer yet, but I read the instructions and the vinegar/water rinse seems quite simple.<br /><br />Overall, for what I paid, I got exactly what I expected and I am very happy withthe performance of the warmer.
B007C8CNGC|1|Our baby prefered to eat from these spoons. They are extremely soft and flexible and perfect for introducing foods. However, after few uses and washes, black mold has appeared inside the handle of the spoon. Re-washing and boiling the spoons does nothing to eliminate the mold. I will never use them again to feed my baby again.
B00ECGX24E|5|Works well for when zooming isn't good enough<br />Even in the night vision.
B00HNTOC7I|5|Love these crib sheets! Stretchy and easy to put on mattress. Actually just ordered more!
B004LE8TOA|4|Very cute book.  Wish the pages were a bit sturdier, but really like the fact that you can insert your own sheets and it's more of a binder
B0054KHSNI|5|I had been looking for some printed flat diapers, and I was thrilled to find these.  The diapers stayed nice and square after washing, making them super-easy to fold.  They work great.
B006VYYL68|4|I purchased this as a light weight alternative for occasional use.  It pushes very easily and is narrow.  I bought this because we have a peg car seat and it can be used as a travel system.  My husband mainly uses this.  He is 6'3 and the handles are plenty tall.  The cup holder stinks, basically a bottled water is all that it holds.  The basket also seems flimsy, but we really dont use the basket other than a blanket or toy.  It is lightweight but still durable.  The fabric is wipeable, we've used it or about 6 months now and haven't had to wash it yet.  My son is 7 months old and 17 lbs and 28 in and I can't get the shoulder straps to fit snugly.  It's not an issue for me b/c mine loves to ride in the stroller so he isnt trying to escape, yet atleast.  It folds semi compactly.  I love that it can stand alone when folded with any of the stroller rubbing on the ground. The shade on this is amazing!!!!  It can completely cover the front of the stroller if the seat is sitting up, if the seat is reclined it still has good coverage.  Babies do not lik sun in their face andut is not a problem with this.  I only paid $220 at a local baby store.  It is pretty pricey for an \\"umbrella\\" type stroller but it does have the features of a full size.
B00PF8A6Q0|4|So confusing! Some AVENT classics have rings, some don't! I wish instead of calling this &#34;classic plus,&#34; AVENT was more clear on the packaging regarding rings vs. no rings. So now I have 8 bottles that need rings and 2 that don't. Its a bit annoying because I have to always remember to hold the empty bottles up and check the height to see if they need rings before pouring.
B00FZGLHVA|3|Good bag but really big. Takes up a lot of room in your diaper bag. I need to clip it to the outside of the bag usually.
B00RZTLLI4|5|I am a postpartum doula and wanted to try this product out to possibly give to my clients. I love this scarf!! The seems are perfect (no worries about loose strings around babies) and the material is way more breathable than most covers on the market. The stretch of the material is perfect enough to give you enough room to feed a large baby or even a toddler yet the fabric is still substantial enough to give you proper coverage to make you feel covered. I will most definitely recommend this wrap to my clients and continue to use it with my toddler!!
B00HI207LK|5|Cute and efficient.
B0026L7BYE|4|I have a different stroller that comes with a bottle holder and snack/key tray, so I am a little bummed that Tike Tech requires the bottle holder to purchased separate. Its very easy to attach and remove, washable and durable. I holds a cup of coffee nicely and the center pouch fits keys or a small coin purse. Its nice, but for the price of the stroller, it should be included.
B001B1FHK0|5|This works wonders.  My twins were getting very upset with water in their eyes.  This thing not only creates the best seal so water doesn't run their faces.  It also prevents water frmo getting in their ears, which is also a bonus as my sno gets ear infections! you will not be disappointed!
B00EVJN6F2|5|Great quality product!
B000GK7AMU|5|Purchased as a baby shower gift. Used for one of the games then gave to mommy. Great item for both game and gift.
B001XOVF3I|4|I like these bottles (I have two each of the 8oz and the 4oz), and my baby seems to like them as well.  I had tried the Medela bottle that came with the pump, but that made my little one way too gassy.  The vent system on these seems to prevent that.  She obviously still needs to burp, but it's way less air and less uncomfortable for her.  I like glass - no one worried about BPA until a few years ago, so who knows if BPA free plastic is safe.  At some point I will probably use plastic bottles too (I don't think I have much choice when she is holding the bottle herself) but I like these for now.  There are a lot of parts, but I use this for one to two bottles of breast milk a day to give my wife a break and let her sleep.  If you are doing more bottles than that or using formula, you may have a different experience.<br /><br />To address issues people have (1) that they break and (2) that they are too heavy for babies to hold.  The bottle says it will break with extreme temperature change, so don't use a bottle warmer and don't warm on the stove.  I pour cold milk from the fridge into a room temperature bottle, then put that in a pot with the hottest water that comes out of my tap.  Five minutes later, bottle is warm enough (not to get into thermodynamics here, but the larger the volume of hot tap water, the quicker the bottle warms).  On the second issue, these explicitly say they are not for babies to hold.
B000F1O8JI|5|I got this for my 6 month old baby boy.  He loves it.  No tipping over and getting hurt when I turn the shopping cart.
B000IDSLOG|4|Not a bad toy - however, I question its authenticity. Its squeaker is very quiet and hard to squeak - compared with my sister's who bought hers from a store. Their squeaker is a 10, while ours is about a 4. Other than that, my baby loves to chew on it.
B004CUCKWK|4|This blanket is incredibly soft, but it is not the color it appears to be in the photo provided (no color info in description). I thought I was buying a white and grayish/platinum colored blanket not a white and baby blue blanket! All in all the blanket is still very cute and seems to be of good quality.
B006PZ3WWC|5|We've had a few on our little guy and these are the best. A little expensive but built well and love their loss/replacement policy. Our son is 15 months and in the 75% for head size, these fit great and he will be able to wear them for a while. Highly recommend.
B006OJIK44|5|i did a lot of researching before deciding on this gate... and i am very happy with it.  installation was time consuming due to the instructions being awful - but now that it's installed i am so confident with it - definitely recommend.
B003H88UAE|3|Thought they would help with potty training, but ended up in the trash.  Maybe if the targets were &#34;bad guys&#34; or something?
B003DZ13E6|4|My grandson loves everything about cars, so finding this item was perfect for us. The car booster is well made and fits perfectly our car and most importantly he loves it.
B004J4VY44|5|Only used it a few times, but it works great. Perfect unit if you are looking for a good priced sterilizer.
B00B1M2TTQ|5|Warm, soft, and just perfect for cool New England nights. Plenty of room for my 7 month old. We are very happy with this purchase.
B00A0ID90A|5|Excellent product!!!
B002DND57M|2|I wasn't to pleased with the Safe Sippy 2. When I first received them, they worked great! I didn't have problems with leaks and my toddlers loved drinking out of them, I thought for sure I had finally found the perfect sippy cup! Unfortunately, all of them leak constantly now (and we're only 2-3 months into use with them). Maybe I've done something wrong *shrugs* but it is insane how much liquid comes out of these cups - I've gone over the directions multiple times to make sure I have the right plug in (I do) and to see if I'm doing something that it causing the leaks (I'm not) - nothing has worked. And we're not talking a little drop here or there, we're talking \\"whoops, I forgot to put the plug in\\" leaks.
B00M362YGW|1|Even me is not easy to drink the water. How my 9 months baby girly can do it.
B004V2I0FU|5|Great thermometer.  Like it more then others because it has a shorter tip so it can't go in too far.  Accurate
B007VBYVVA|5|I have to admit that these were not what I was expecting.  I was expecting the really thick diapers that wear forever.  I also have to confess that I bought them to use for rags.  So I get these very thin filmy diapers and much to my delight that they work great for rags, better than the thick ones for spreading stain on furniture.  They work great for dust rags and for cleaning up messes on floors.  However, I willl reserve my judgement for a few months until I have thoroughly abused them.
B00H5OI9XO|5|Works great and stays cold. Very handy!!
B000O3GCFU|5|I bought this one and the blue 10 ounce jar for both my kids. They can have their favorite meals at school any day now. I usually make chicken soup, chicken nuggets, macaroni for them. I would highly recommend this product!!
B00DJS63Q0|5|works great to expand your waitstband by 2&#34;
B000JP1LOA|5|This head support worked well for my newborn son. It is soft, washable and presentable. Do make sure your child has no sensitivities to rough textures, as this is not super smooth or soft.
B00V8KLX3E|5|Product is rock solid. Installed in minutes in my car and I can already tell it is a high quality product. The storage pocket comes in clutch. I did not think I would use it as often as I have in the short time I have had the product. Highly recommended. Already ordered another set for wife's car.
B00BXE5NWM|5|Love these cups - my kids throw them around constantly, and they really take a beating. Added bonus, the lids from the NUK insulated cups also fit on these cups (which was awesome because the insulated cups broke on me in no time). Works out great since my younger prefers the spout and my older likes the 'big boy lid'.
B00EPFH7DY|4|Small and compact. These are our to go out cups. The only downside , the flow is a little too fast and there is more spill then with the one we use at home that we got from our pediatrician, but in general these cups are good.
B004J4VY2G|1|I bought these bottles already having the mipump and thought they would be great as my baby already loves the one that the pump came with. I was leary but after having precious milk leak I had to warn others. I even tried to put food coloring in water to see where and why this was happening. It leaks frm under the ring inside where the bag is. They are also open bottles that require a bag I hadn't noticed this untill I recived them. There is no way around the leaking and that is my biggest issue. I will be returning these they are a great product if they did not loose my baby's precious liquid gold.
B00DJPK8P0|3|Not good as expected.
B00CXGPNC4|1|The back to the music player was missing and so my daughter is unable to use the sounds to soothe the baby! I wish I would've known that earlier because I would've returned the bassinet and purchased from someone else!
B000E9T8GO|3|I have this at the top of the stairs so my son won't fall down and it works great when my kids don't wiggle it loose.  You can open and close one handed after you break it in and it is pretty durable.  But as I said my kids have gotten it loose twice so far so it is unpredictable.  I know it's not an installation error because my husband is superman when it comes to installing safety items around the house for the kids!
B001FB5BFW|5|To clean this you must remove two pieces that hold the fabric to the seat.  They are located at the bottom on both sides by pressing underneath the seat (if you have big hands it's a pain to do it). When you remove them, do this: use a cutter and CUT OFF the edges, the next time it will pop out easily.
B000E82WRM|5|This mat has afforded is an uncountable number of hours of quiet time. As with most of her toys, we use it for a week, put it away for a week, bring it back out etc. and she never loses interest. Every 2 weeks is like a new toy all over again. It hasn't leaked or given us any problems for 4 months now!
B005PRQ5KM|5|Looks adorable in my kitchen with the Boon rack! I've even recommended it to my girlfriends. It makes my kitchen look so much brighter.
B00UDQ52MW|5|Excellent
B00005V6C8|3|We liked the Diaper Dekor until our son got old enough to actually rip the thing apart. The top isn't toddler proof so by 15 months he was throwing his toys into the top. It isn't the best job to have to fish toys out of a bag filled with poppy diapers-and new unused diapers that my son decided to throw in there too-what a waste. yuck! then by 18 months he figured out how to take the front cover off and nothing was sacred. We threw it out just a week ago. He is 19 months old now. Since we will be potty training him soon, we don't mind throwing his diapers in the trash for the time being and emptying the trash every day. However, we were hoping to use it for our second too, coming in just a month, to save some money. Unfortunately my son had the thing so discombobulated we couldn't get it to fit together right anymore and it just STANK! So we are opting to buy another pail. We are buying the Safety 1st Easy Saver pail this time and we are hoping for the best. <br /> <br />At 12 months we starting noticing a stink. It handled small baby diapers just fine but starting smelling bad as my son got older. Also, the refills start running out quicker and quicker as the diapers get bigger and bigger so in the beginning you get a lot of mileage out of one refill pack, but by the time toddler days hit, you are buying them all the time. I highly recommend buying something that doesn't require special refills. <br /> <br />This pail served its purpose for us for a time and was great in the beginning, but I am hoping this other pail we are buying will see us through baby #2's toddler days and through potty training.
B002CRIQMS|4|I have the natural color and its a pretty nice crib for the price. Nothing fancy and some of the screw holes are deep and it didnt come with those dots that some furniture comes with to plug it so it looks nicer. If you dont want to spend too much on a crib but you dont want anything crappy this is a good choice. The removable side is great because you can set it up next to your bed so its a co sleeper crib. Easy access to the baby. If you have a very high bed it will be a little low even on the highest setting but you can always put something under the baby mattress to even it out.
B0009EXN10|1|I normally love playtex cups and bottles. I hate these though. They leak. Bring back the old ones. I loved them.
B0000CARJQ|5|This silverware set is just what you would want for a baby/toddler. They are not to sharp or have harsh edges which is great for my baby, but are able to grab into food and do its job for my toddler. They are short and easy to handle for children and come in a nice variety for them to choose from. My biggest thing was if the spoons were deep enough to actually get stuff into... YES! Dishwasher safe too! Highly recommend!!
B002UKXLJK|4|Did it's job! a Little uncomfortable and noticeable but not as bad as actual soreness or engorged breast
B006JIN2E8|4|Lightweight, easy for my 20 mo old son to carry around. Sturdy. A little bit bulky with the large round size. But overall good
B005ZFFDMU|3|Baby did not like. Nipple a bit harder then other brands. Expensive for what it is. A bottle.
B0002ADQOU|1|It is important to clamp the seat belt when using a child's car seat but this clip is hard to use and a pain to get on and off. A better system is the red clamp that comes with other car seats.    The Graco seat is a design nightmare and should be avoided at all costs.    Always test the seat installation before buying.
B004FF84O0|3|Cute comforter, but twinkle lights were underwhelming at best.  My 4 yr old absolutely loved her new Tiana bedspread and was worth the $$.
B000PRUAFI|5|I've had this gate for almost 2 years now and it has not let me down yet. It still works (and looks) just like it did when it was brand new. My twins are now 4 years old and they have yet to figure out how to open it. That's actually amazing considering 2 years ago we went through 4-5 gates trying to find one that could outsmart them. Now they are tall enough to almost be able to crawl over it so I'm upgrading to the taller one and am selling this shorter one. By the way, the resale value on these good quality gates is very good. Definitely worth it and necessary to invest in the higher quality one like this. It has left no marks on my door frame and it stood firm the whole time without any drilling or holes.
B008WNV23Q|4|I shopped around for quite awhile for bedding that was perfect for our impending arrival, but didn't want to spend a couple hundred dollars on it. This set was right on target. It is cute, priced right, and didn't have the unnecessary comforter or bumper. I was also excited because it comes with decals that compliment the set.<br /><br />The bedding itself is as expected, looks great. The blanket that is included is very soft on one side and will definitely be used. However, we are having the same issues with the decals not staying on the walls as some previous reviewers mentioned who bought the decals separately. We cleaned our wall prior to applying them, our paint is in good condition, and though our walls have some light texture, it is nothing that should keep them from sticking. Our son's room has decals on the same type of wall and we haven't had any issues. I am frustrated that they keep falling off and are pretty much unusable, unless we apply some sort of adhesive. If I had bought them separately, I would be returning them. I would never put them on the wall next to the crib, as they could be a choking hazzard. Had the decals stayed in place, I would've given the set 5 stars.
B001P5HLXI|4|I purchased this bag because I wanted a eco friendly diaper bag that was good quality and big enough for everything I need  to put in it.  I received it in the mail today and was so excited to open it.  For being a company that brags about being eco friendly the box could have been smaller and the bag was in a plastic bag they could of wrapped it in a paper bag or something that is more widely recyclable.  Other then that the bag is great quality! Nice and thick and stays on my shoulder and that is a good thing since most bags just fall off me.  The only one thing I don't like is the changing mat is 100% polyester I wish it was cotton or some natural material like Hemp.  Other then that the bag is awesome!! And Beautiful!
B005XQ9J0S|3|Cute but very small.
B00K58VTBG|5|I've been using these for over 6 months and they've held up beautifully. The owls are made of a soft, plush material (like a baby blanket) and are easy to clean - just toss in the wash with baby's other stuff. I love the subtle colors and how padded they are.
B000Q7G3VM|5|Love this. My 1 year old loves looking at pictures on my phone. This way he can't delete them and I can switch out the pictures when I want.
B008LEZXIQ|1|Didn't help my 15 month old who had three molars coming in! I even tried having him sleep with the bracelet on his ankle under is feetie pjs!! :(
B005UJ32S8|4|Our 9 month old does his business on this potty about twice a day. It seems to be a good thing that it is low to the ground. It helps him, being more in the squatting position. He does sort of topple out of it if he were left unattended but that is to be expected, at this young age. The potty is simple and beautiful in gray and very easy to clean. It's also small as noted by others so we actually keep it in the credenza in the living room to catch him in the moment. Love it!
B00523JNYO|5|We bought these bibs after trying a lot of other kinds, including the aden + anais burpy bibs, because our son drooled like crazy!  These bibs kept the moisture away from his face and off his clothes, and they didn't need replacing multiple times a day.  We also loved that they snapped; the velcro on a lot of the cheaper bibs aggravated our son's skin.  The fabric and the color hold up very well despite constant washing.  I cannot recommend these bibs highly enough - I wish we had known about them from the start and not wasted our money elsewhere.  Definitely worth the money, you won't regret it!
B00E1CI2TO|5|Really good
B001D18P4I|5|I bought two, for my twins.  I love that this bumper comes in 4 pieces, very easy to tie on!  And most imprtantly, my goodness, they are so soft.  They have minky dots on the inside and smooth and soft minky fabric on the back.
B000Q7G3VM|5|Once filled with family photos this keeps baby occupied for a very long time.  a true keepsake as well.
B004FI9AUY|5|Needed a light for the bathroom at night for when we have guests not familiar with the house.  These lit up the room perfect and they are true to being cool touch all night long.  Came as promised and work great.
B001AMK6G0|4|My son discovered small sensory balls (a bit bigger than a golf ball) at a Gymboree class and wouldn't let go of three of them for an hour.  He was to the point of tears at the end of class when he had to leave them behind.  I searched for the small sensory balls everywhere but couldn't find them but I thought these would be pretty good.  These are about the size of an orange.  When the box arrived and we opened it, he just walked away.  Months later, he still does not play with them.  Even when I throw one at him or hand him one, he plays with it for a second or two by throwing it and walking it away.  I didn't want to give these a low rating because the balls themselves are good quality and it's not their fault that he doesn't like them.  I just wish they had them in the smaller size.
B000B4SVM4|4|My Baby loves this it puts him to sleep and he stays happy. It hasn't held together as well as I had hoped, but for a mother with a fussy baby it was wonderful until he was about three months old (15 lbs), by then he was so heavy the fabric sagged a lot and made it difficult for the swing to move. Glad I bought it and will save it to use on my next baby.
B000LP3VEG|4|The seat is adjustable and has two cup holders.  It worked well for us - used it for years with no problem.
B004V2I0FU|5|At first I was hesitate to purchase this, but we needed to have a baby thermometer in the house. I did some searching and didn't find much on the web, this product was highly recommended & we LOVE it! We had to use it for our first fever and it worked wonderfully, she didn't even cry/flinch when we used it. I had to use the thermometer throughout the day/night on her and it gave accurate readings each & every time. I highly recommend this product, the readings read in about 8 sec.
B00JFUN6ZC|5|Very fun and versatile! Loved by my kiddos. Only down side: I wish the wheels had a resistance adjustment.
B00F9Q3ETE|5|This is a much have if you have the B-O-B, I wish it was standard. Just a few velcro straps and it is installed, very handy
B002AS9MEK|5|This was an excellent purchase for my grandson.  Is lightweight, very confy and roomy.   Easy to handle.  The canopy is excellent, especially for a sunny day, you can adjust or extend the size.
B004JU0H7I|5|this works Awesome for my pack and play that i got from Target. I ruined the pad/cardboard thing that comes with the pack and play by soaking it in water for too long. So i got this to replace that. Works great!
B00KS4CHTA|5|I was surprised how easy this was to put up. Love IT!!!
B001I463G2|5|I bought this as an alternative to the cheap, low-quality pack-n-plays, which we had for our first child and quickly gave it away. We also bought an octagon wooden playpen for our son. I don't remember the name, but I know it was expensive. We gave that away bc my son would hurt himself if he fell against the rails. I chose this playpen bc I wanted something sturdier that would be useful as the baby grew. Also, the sides had to be soft but taut enough to not pose a choking hazard. We are very happy with this purchase. It is very sturdy and easy to move roll around the house, bc of the two wheels on one side. I don't worry about it caving in the middle or anything like that. Also, this product comes assembled, so that made my husband happy. This is a very good buy.
B003Y3BH1G|5|My son is a thrower!  These things have made my life so much easier.  I don't have to constantly wipe toys off when he throws them to the ground.
B000F1MUKM|4|Our family room is a converted garage with french doors, so the doorway is 4 ft wide and I needed something sturdy that would still allow the doors to close if needed. This is perfect. I applied a lot of pressure on it, and it didn't budge. The door is easy to open for an adult, but not for a child since you have to lift and open at the same time. I like that it closes and latches on its own too.<br /><br />The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because we used the larger extension and the holes for the connecting piece on the bottom weren't perfectly lined up, so there's a small gap between the bottom of the extender piece and the floor. It's very small, maybe about a cm, but still a slight annoyance. Otherwise it was fairly simple to put together and install.
B00RZTLLAW|5|I ordered this Nursing Cover in Navy. I absolutely love this product !! It is made of great quality and very comfortable. I really love that the fabric is breathable and soft. It wears like a scarf and when it is time to nurse it is very easy to cover up with this. I have been using this for 2 weeks now and do not have one complaint. I would totally recommend this as a must have for all new mothers. I will be purchasing more of these for baby shower gifts because they are a must have..
B002NLFWY8|5|Holds up well to washings. My grandson loves this character set!
B00IMN8SW4|5|Quick delivery.  My niece said her son loves them in the bat tub.
B0014HQITA|5|I almost didn't get this sheet after reading other reviews which said it shrinks a lot.  I haven't had any shrinkage... just follow the package directions and dry on low.  This sheet is super stretchy and easy to get on the mattress. I am amazed how soft it is.  I'll be ordering more.
B00J57QQ84|5|Yes I love
B000IG8HRO|2|This thing was so much bigger than my crib. You can't even try to make it fit cuz its so big. My crib is a 24 x 38 but this things got to be a 28 x 42. Make sure you got a big crib before you buy this mattress protector.
B00Q8TPOXK|4|Needed to baby-proof the house and these Edge Guards seemed to fit the bill. Applied them to 2 tables without any problems. We'll see how they do with the LO. He may just rip them off! Haha! Great product so far! =)
B001QKGLZQ|5|Here's my problem, I live with two tiny ninjas. They can open any drawer, cabinet, door and probably diffuse a bomb or whatnot. These two are like trained assassins (I mean what 2 year old isn't right?) These door latches appear to keep them out of the closets,(at least so far). Which is much better than the other similar products I have tried. I am extremely impressed with these and would highly recommend them to anyone with ninjas in their homes.
B0032FOOQ6|4|This is a very sturdy gate and the mesh is nice because my son tends to bang his head on everything. The only thing I don't like about it is that the mesh has a lot of slack to it and my son smashes his face against it. It's pretty funny, but I don't like how much it stretches out to the other side. If the gate was used in a 60' doorway I don't think it would have as much slack. Our doorway is about 42 inches.
B009ODV71K|4|Not genuine leather. It's fake? But very cute, fits a lot! Full magazine. Long wallet etc... But it's not leather
B00OK124H2|3|Super cute! Wish it came with more for the price.
B00KZ1GVZW|3|Arrived quickly. Well made. Looks great. My only problem is that the size of the chewable part is too large for my 5 year old son.
B0070A9FBI|5|Can be assembled in less than a minute. Light weight and compact. The best we could find, but also the most expensive.
B005IWM6CA|4|I bought this for my daughter and it looks good.
B000IDSLOG|5|Came as described. No complaints
B003UTUEOU|5|I bought this pillow for my sister who is pregnant of course. She said she loves it, it wraps around, not just a long tube pillow.
B008VWN510|3|Quality and ease of use are both great.  The light weight fabric is good for warmer months. The problem is the size.  We have used Large Halo sleep sacs on our son and they fit very well, but the Large Early Walker Sleepsack is huge.  We still use it like a sleep sac because our 20 month old son's feet are nowhere near the ribbed bands at the bottom.
B0035LLG2W|2|This works I guess. But we hardly use it. When your baby is crying you don't wanna wait the 3 minutes for this. It also makes the outside of the bottle very hot which I don't like. By the way the outside of the bottle feels you'd think the milk inside was boiling hot-although it isn't, just warm.
B001Q9EGMM|4|I must say I absolutely love this portable crib. I only took off a star because even though it was shipped to me very fast (a week earlier than was expected), it was missing the hardware to put it together. Dream On me however was very quick in sending me the missing pieces. Trust me I am a very impatient person, especially with the added hormones of pregnacy. But they were very efficient and I am understanding that no one is perfect and mistakes are made.<br /><br />I also purchased a portable crib mattress, which I must say I am very happy I did because the \\"mattress\\" that comes with it, is pretty much just for when it shifts into a play pen..its kinda like a thick mattress pad. But it was exactly what I was expecting it to be so i have no hard feelings about it.<br /><br />All in all great product..I even put my 3 year old god daughter in it to make sure it would be sturdy enough for the baby. :-)
B004E9SW7G|3|First off, I find it extremely concerning that the success of my pumping efforts and ability to feed my infant while at work teeters uncertainly on the point of a pair of tiny, fragile, and insanely expensive plastic valves.  Like many, my Ameda pump was insurance-issued and I had no choice of pump.  With a brand new set of valves, my pump performs great.  I baby my valves, removing them with a.spoon per my Ameda customer service representative's instructions, carefully washing, and air drying them on a towel. Despite my efforts, these spendy little nuggets go downhill fast. I swear, all you need to do is look at them wrong and they instantly develop microscopic tears.  Within a week or two, my pump suction begins to suffer, as does my husband as he deals with my pump-induced frustration and mounting rage. It seems like every mom I talk to has some issue with their pump, regardless of brand.  I will say that I had great experience with the Ameda customer support staff, even receiving a replacement motor early on when mine crapped out.  Yes, it was great to get a free pump through insurance, but being locked into the constant valve replacement is not-so-great.  But, here we are!
B005123EHI|4|Works. Would have been better if my husband wouldn't have so lazily installed them.
B000RFC39E|3|Daughter loved it, but the suction on the bowl it taken off easily by an 18 month old. Bowl and utensil set is cute though.
B00318CLTQ|1|Wish there were 0 stars for review.<br />I ordered two of these. After less than 1 week, the &#34;clip&#34; broken and came out for both bottles. Now, every time when the lid is opened, I need to pay attention to make sure the clip won't come out.<br />Do not recommend.
B003MUA3L6|4|This it a pretty good compromise between a $15 umbrella stroller and a $300 umbrella stroller.  I use it primarily for airplane travel but to also keep in the trunk of my car for outings (though I mostly use a shopping cart of ergo carrier).  I've had it for 2 months which included 2 airplane trips and so far it's held up perfectly,<br /><br />Pros: Fairly easy to push (not as easy as a BOB stroller, but that is to be expected at this price point and for an umbrella stroller) even over sand at the zoo it worked pretty well, seat reclines for sleeping baby, fairly easy to collapse/unfold (it gets easier over time due to experience as well as the joints loosening up)<br /><br />Cons: Sun shade is not very protective, except when in the fully reclined position. Pretty heavy (though I hardly have to carry it, so not a big deal).  The color is VERY bright orange- not the most attractive color.
B000HM2ILU|2|We are generally disappointed in this toy.  The first one we received was defective and didn't work at all.  We returned it to the store but were informed it was discontinued, so we had to order a replacement online.  When it arrived, it also did not work as advertised, but it does work.  However, it is VERY loud!  The speaker is located inside Pooh's head, and we can't get inside the toy to muffle it with tape or anything else.  I imagine it would be loud enough to damage a child's hearing if the child's ear is close to it.  That being said, my 4-year-old likes it, but my 9-month-old (whom it was actually for) ignores it.
B00ODV8FKY|5|Solid
B001OC5UMQ|4|We are using this Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate to keep our dogs from going upstairs. It fits the opening perfectly and was easy to install.
B00021D1GC|5|Arrived on time. Bought this for my newborn whose face was broken out with baby acne. It's helped already and it smells amazing! Will buy again
B006ZVV0R0|1|My infant's head was way too big for my infant.
B00NFETDR4|5|I love this soother.  It plays lots of different songs and the light show is so peaceful, even my colicky baby loves to fall asleep to it.  It plays for 25 minutes which is great.  I love the different settings.  I just can't say enough about this product!
B001UF8BL4|5|My baby loved it as a lil guy 2-3 months & still loves & plays with it now as an 18 month old! We Love Baby Einstein Products!!!
B001RJUVS4|5|We purchased one of these for our toddler a year ago.  He loves it.  We fill it with goldfish crackers, raisins, sliced vegetables, cereal...  It is large enough to fit anything, and since you can dishwasher it, cleaning this is easy.  Oh, and it never, ever spills!<br /><br />So, now that our daughter turned one, it is time to buys some more.  You can't lose with these.  Made in the USA with safe materials!<br /><br />Spend the extra money to purchase something of quality, and you'll only buy it once!
B002VWRPZ8|5|My daughter is entertained.. She loves all the bright colors. it can be attached to her car seat and stroller. :)
B0036SGC8C|5|Lo uso para asegurar el casco de mi moto y era justamente lo que esperaba . Lo recomiendo totalmente . La informaci&oacute;n recibida del producto se ajusta a lo real
B0010L98DI|1|I liked Dr Browns Bottles, my daughter Liked them too! Then I found out about Bisphenol -A being used to make the Bottles. After re-searching Bisphenol -A, I discovered that exposing my baby to harmful chemicals with the potential for long term affects later in life, was definitely not for me!! There are other options out there, all glass bottles are safe, as well as Born Free, Mam by Sassy, Green to Grow and Adrini. Do your own research. I'm really surprised the non Bisphenol -A Free bottles haven't been recalled yet! I'm sure it's just a matter of time, before enough people are educated.
B004FN0Z4E|3|We have the Chicco Cortina system stroller and car seat and love it, but it's really big and bulky. When we went on a trip to visit family this summer we wanted something more portable and looked at a lot of umbrella strollers. This one seemed to be the sturdiest we could find at this price range. We've really enjoyed it; it works perfectly for short outings to the mall or stores. It's lightweight and the turning radius of the front wheels makes it very maneuverable. The only thing about it that I don't like is that the recline is very small, only an inch or two. We keep it fully reclined all the time for my daughter's comfort because the normal position is pretty much vertical. I also wouldn't recommend this for an all-day outing because the lack of recline makes it difficult for her to nap in. Good, sturdy umbrella stroller though.<br /><br />Edit (2/24/12): We've had the stroller for just over five months now and though we use the stroller only casually for trips to the mall the handle covers have started to fall apart. The rest of the stroller is still working perfectly, but the handle issues makes it uncomfortable to use. Changing original rating from 4 stars to 3.
B000I1T8DQ|4|We just received this mirror for my baby.  She's sitting on her own now, and likes to grab at it, although she mostly uses it as a teething toy unless we're there to show her it's features.  She likes to see it light up and play music, and smiles when we hold it close to her.  I think it will be a great toy to use for playtime, and in her crib, for months to come.  My only disappointment is that I think it's a bit overpriced for what it is.  Still, I'm happy we have it!
B004UAD0RQ|1|Based on all the positive Best View monitor reviews, it sounded like the one to go for.  When the new model came out, I called Summer Infant and they nicely replaced our old model with the new model since it had been only a few months and we wanted to add a camera and they had no extra cameras left.  So A+ on their cutomer service.  But everything else about the monitor is poor.  The screen is tiny and the picture is grainy and not very clear.  I dropped the monitor by mistake a few weeks ago and the screen was damaged, so I needed to buy a new one.  I decided to try something different and bought the Motorolla monitor- which is amazing.  The screen size and picture quality is increadible.  It makes me wonder how anyone can give the best view more than 1 star-- perhaps the reviewers have never used another monitor to compare it to.
B0030EH8OO|2|The design of the stroller is okay. My son liked sitting in it and was comfortable. It is light weight and the basket is big enough. The cup holder for the child is so nice.<br /><br />The problem I had was we used it infrequently for one summer. Stored it inside for the winter. Brought it out for the next summer and just used it once and the wheel broke off, cleanly! Too late to return for an exchange and it was used very lightly and stored indoors. Not sure why this happened.
B001GFAFDU|5|Not the best thing but it did what it described.
B003REKG3W|4|Used this nap map for probably 3 years and washed it every week.  Held up great.  Would be better if the pillow were removable; the pillow lost it's shape pretty early on.
B00005C1JP|5|Have bo
B003TJAGA8|5|I am currently nursing my sixth child I have been through so many different nursing pads and by far these are the best
B003SRIQLM|5|I love the variety of sizes they come in and the big ones can fit a lot things in it. I use these to hold all my beauty products, they keep my room organized, and they are decorative!
B00005BYUR|5|These bottles do actually almost eliminate the air infants take in when nursing.  I noticed an immediate improvement with gassiness, fussiness and reflux symptoms with my twins.  We have exclusively used them from 6 weeks to nine months with no complaints whatsoever...not even any leaking.  If you have tried everything, use these.  If you can avoid wasting your money trying anything else, try these first.
B00HAA3KTQ|5|Perfect for a heavy wetter for overnights!
B001ER8KMI|4|We purchased this since we like to travel.  Our first trip was a great success!  This car seat was very easy to travel with, especially with all of the opening and closing of the stroller getting on/off the airplane, into & out of the Hertz courtesy shuttle, going through airport security, etc.  It literally takes 3 seconds to push/pull the handle bar and the wheel open/close mechanism.  The wheels stroll and turn very smoothly and the whole system is not very heavy & cumbersome.    The not-so-convenient steps with using this may apply to all strollers...such as finding the child-seat restraint hooks on the cars (especially the one behind the seat).  Also, the belt that goes over our child's lap when she is in the seat needs to be loosened and moved each time we put her in and out of the seat.  But this may apply to all child seat designs anyway.    Altogether, this is certainly a valuable purchase for those who like to travel.  We HIGHLY recommend it.
B00H8MQ81S|2|Product arrived with wrong parts
B000CNOIQ2|2|The warmer stopped warming the wipes after only two months. I got a defective warmer.
B00H4E9WLI|1|As soon as I opened the box I smelled a very strong soapy chemical odor that sometimes comes from foams. You really couldn't miss it.  I didn't even set up the tray yet, and I had to put the seat outdoors because it was stinking up the whole condo. I don't have a keen sense of smell. I'm one of those people who is the last to know there's an odor in the room and I smelled it. I left the seat outdoors for 2 days  in the sun, but it continued to stink. I think the smell is too strong if you can still smell it in the house after I put it outside. I called summer infant and they said they would exchange it, but I am still so repulsed by how they can release a product like that. I don't think all their seats are like that, but some of them might be.
B004I5BU8E|5|LOVE !! I purchased one almost 2 years ago when my child was almost 5. It still looks brand new, no stains. very easy to use and quite beautiful. We always get complements on it. I'm back to purchase another for my husbands car. My daughter is almost 7 now and will still need to be in a booster for another 3 years might as well have one in both cars esp since it comes easily apart. Could recommend enough. Should also say our daughter loves it as well and is comfortable on the longest of trips.
B00H8MSEWY|5|Haven't opened the box yet as this is for my Grandson's 1st Birthday and that will be Saturday
B000056OV0|5|I'm not sure what we would have done without this.  We absolutely love it and so does the baby.
B004CJ9D6W|1|This monitor is absolutely horrible!! If I didn't throw the box out I would have returned it. The monitor is not color like described. The night vision is non existent! I can not see a thing in my daughters room unless her light is on. I am now saving up for a new monitor that will not be a Levana!!
B00BDON83S|1|Not worth the price. Go to local auto store and purchase one cheaper and bigger
B00BGY935C|5|the best..loving it
B006TTECQY|5|Purchased as a gift for my niece and she loves it. Very cute.
B002WYJYT0|5|I have two of these and they are very useful.  I can use them on any shape pacifier and they have prevented them from getting dirty (from falling on the ground).<br /><br />I am glad I got them and recommend them to anyone.
B00EMZ379A|5|Used for a very dangerous vanity mirror in bathroom.  Looks great and serves its purpose.
B00005QI1H|4|We received the Deluxe Take Along Swing by Fisher-Price as a gift off our registry, but I never knew how much we would all love this swing!<br />As first time parents, we didn't know all the ways to calm a somewhat fussy baby. However, when we put our son in this swing, he would happily stay in there all day! My husband works out of our home, so this swing can be with him in his office if I need to go off and be elsewhere, or I can take it with me to any room in the house.<br />The only reason that I didn't give this swing the full 5 stars is because it would be nice if there was a way to have just the music and the swinging motion, because the combination of the lights, music, and motion seems a bit overstimulating to very young babies.
B000OS8BP4|5|Like most of the other parents here, I luuuve the Nosefrida, especially during winter cold season. I saw some reviewers complaining that using it was a 2-person operation due to the need to restrain your kid. Here's how we do it as a one-woman (or man) job. I lie our daughter down on the floor on her back, and sit at the top of her head, one leg over each of her arms, with her head right between my thighs. She knows what's coming, and kicks her little legs and complains (loudly), but it's all over quickly and she is _so_ much happier. I am now enjoying her latest cold and I wish there was a Nosefrida for adults.
B005MATQNK|5|Baby loves the swaddler! Easy to use without the annoying velcro like many other products.
B001O9F6M8|4|I got this for my brother who has a new born.  When i asked him how it was, he said he loved it.  They dont have any issues with it.
B004XOK0OA|5|Love this desk chair!  We put it in our living room, my daughter uses it to color, eat, play, sit and watch TV, everything.  She loves it and so do I.  It was just the solution I was looking for.<br /><br />As for the assembly, my husband said it was easy to put together.
B007A2ZRRC|2|Reviews said that these were easy to remove , not true . Took all the paint off the dresser. Not happy.
B001HD75I4|5|Pros:  - Very easy operation  - Lightweight  - Very convenient in airports (security, onloading, offloading etc)    Cons:  - A bit of a rough ride for the little guy on surfaces such as sidewalks and roads though he did not seem to mind that much  - Adjusting the harness straps is not that easy and they cannot be loosened/tightened quickly and requires some effort
B00BXWTVJ0|5|Works great!  Love the clean water reservoir.
B0053OSQK4|3|I bought 12 pairs of Kissaluvs trainers (plus additional boosters, [[ASIN:B002UD6DB0 Kissaluvs Cotton Fleece Booster Doublers, 6 Pack, Unbleached]] and started to use them 3 1/2 weeks ago. Snaps have already come off FOUR pairs of these trainers. I emailed the company and sent three pairs back to Kissaluvs last week for repair, and the fourth lost a snap today. THIS IS VERY DISAPPOINTING. I am just going to go buy a snap press and continue to fix them myself.<br /><br />On the bright side, I haven't had the smell problem at all. Its probably my diaper wash cycle: Pre-rinse & soak in the washer with baking soda. Then a heavy hot wash cycle with an All Free & Clear pod. Dry.<br /><br />These are great trainers.... except for the snap issue! Too bad you have to snap them to keep them on!
B00JRYRYS6|5|excellent car seat
B00AJSJCC0|5|Grandson loved it
B00155WJ4E|5|So far so good. I did purchase the bar for baby (10 months), he likes it because he can grab onto it and look around.
B000TW3BNC|5|These little swaddleme wraps are great. Our new granddaughter has slept so much better as a newborn than her older brother who didn't have these ever did! This is the best \\"new to me\\" baby thing I have seen in a long time.
B004LKS95I|5|This highchair is very Sturdy. And not difficult to assemble. I like the 3 sitting positions and the height adjustment.
B00K5KVC52|5|Best bottles ever baby like these more than v any other brand we have used
B005LRU5MU|4|I'm well out of the diaper bag stage so I never really looked at JuJuBe's product line before their Tokidoki collaboration. The Mighty Be is a great alternative to those ubiquitous canvas totes. Light, easy to roll and store, the Mighty Be is almost perfect. I wish it had a zipper option, and I prefer the stiffer lining of the Tokidoki collaboration to the slick satin lining of the standard bags. The bright interior color makes finding things a breeze.. Nice strap drop. the outer pockets are perfectly designed. My Mighty Be usually holds 2 Camelback Groove bottles and a cell phone in the outer three chambers, 2 sets of gym clothes, shoes, my purse, snacks for the Tweens, a hardcover and a Be Quick with toiletries. The bag still doesn't feel over stuffed. Great product, feels far more expensive than it is.
B009F98SSS|5|I bought these to dispose of the waste in my cat's litter box. I like them far better than the typical cat waste disposal bags. I am always impressed with Arm & Hammer products, for the most part (except their cat litter, ironically). I figured if these bags were made to handle the messes that tiny humans make, they should be fine for tiny cats. The lavender scent was nice. It did a good job of masking the ammonia scent that is often present in clumps that come out of the cat's litter box. The bags were also slightly thicker than the typical pet waste bags, which seemed to do a better job of blocking the odor in the trash can. I would recommend that these be listed with the pet supplies as well. They worked out great.
B002IWYXH4|1|To the makers of the new Diaper Champ:    I am very disappointed in the new Diaper Champ. We had one of the older Diaper Champs for our first son and we loved it. When anyone mentioned Diaper Genie, we quickly steered them towards your product. \\"Don't get stuck buying up their expensive cartridges,\\" we'd say. Not anymore. If it was just one flaw, I could handle it, but you have re-designed the DC to the point of uselessness.    First, it's much shorter. I'm not a tall guy, so I can only imagine how frustrating this is for taller people. I want to stay as close to my daughter when she's on the changing table, bending over just gets me that much further from her. Plus, I'm an adult. Bending over gets tougher each year. Every time I toss out a diaper, I'm reminded that next time, will be a little more uncomfortable.    Secondly, it's smaller. Your claim that it allows for less odors to escape is ridiculous. Of course it's going to smell less, because I'm changing the bag in it every other day. So much for saving money in these difficult times.     Thirdly, did anyone actually open the Champ and try replacing a bag before you shipped it off? It is top heavy and ridiculously off-balance. If the Diaper Champ is open, it will not stand up. How does a fact like this get past your development team? Do your engineers have children? I have banged-up walls and stubbed toes because of this ridiculous and unnecessary \\"upgrade.\\"     I don't know why you felt the need to upgrade a fine product. Yes, it's true, scraping my knuckles every time I opened the old Champ was not a pleasant experience. I do like the \\"button\\" option on the new one, though getting a bag in and out of the Champ is like some kind of Chinese Chin-Ning Chu mind game. I'm with kids all day, so I need a little mental stimulation, but at what cost, I ask you? Every time I am rocking my daughter to sleep, I sneer at my new Diaper Champ and whisper, \\"Why can't you be like your big brother?\\" Imagine the damage I am doing to my daughter.
B00H8MSKAU|5|easy to install and adjusts to fit easily
B005PWVIZE|5|This is simply perfect for underneath your bathroom vanity, kitchen sink, or furniture hutches. Nothing to install or damage your cabinets. Just slip it on over the handles, tighten the clasp, and you're done. The clasp mechanism is easy for adults to slip up and down and has so far deterred my toddler from even trying to figure it out. I wish all my cabinets were this easy to childproof!  The seller also sent a short but thoughtful personal letter with the shipment that described how she started her small business as a young mom who just invented her own solution to a child-proofing product void. She utilizes domestic suppliers (as much as possible) and gives people with disabilities the much-valued opportunity to have a small but important job helping her package and prepare her product for shipment. My mentally-disabled aunt has had a similar business-owner give her this same opportunity for many years now and I can't tell you how important it's been to her and her value as a productive working adult. If only ALL U.S. business owners could give back just a little! On top of buying an awesome product, it made me feel good about who I was buying from. Hands down - 5 stars to the seller and 5 stars to the product.
B00AJSJE3C|5|i brought this gate for the dog area and my daughter liked it so much she is going to buy one.we love it.
B005J58CV0|5|This little table kept my little girl entertained for hours she loved the music and lights evertime she put a ball in the middle then she got to figure out where it came from must buy for babies its awesome
B006K6DF9Q|5|We have tried various swaddles (most being the wrap/velcro kind) but they were a hassle and the baby's arms could easily escape. The velcro on the other products also wore out quickly. We could not use plain blankets because our babies could escape no matter how tight we wrapped them so this was a perfect solution. This product was so amazing that I kept using it for 4 months (had to stop when she could roll over and force her arms out the top).  I love the easy and fast zipper and the lightweight material. It was so nice to be able to keep the baby dressed in long-sleeves/sleep N' play/footy PJ's and then this swaddle without worrying about over-heating. Diaper changes are easy and quick with this swaddle because it zips from both ends so you might even be able to keep your newborn from waking up! I buy this product for all of my pregnant friends! I wish they made it in bigger sizes because my older baby loved being swaddled.
B007SNK6QA|5|My sensory son loves this. Helps him stay focused. Even my non sensory kid asked for one, seems to help her too. Strong enough that lasts for months with daily chewing.
B000U404OI|5|Very cute and goes with the Jungle Babues theme! I purchased this as a gift and it looks so cute in the room :)
B00GF9B28O|3|I have the Britax B-Safe car seat and this fits in the middle of the car seat handle due to the wider sides of the handle.  If you are carrying the seat with only your hand this would work.  I'm somewhat small so I find it easier to hook the carseat on my forearm to carry- this cushion does not fit on that part of the car seat handle.  It's okay but I probably would not purchase again.  Also was disappointed when I initially received at the cushioning.  It's more a a thick neoprene than full cushioning.  I suppose this might be better as it will not flatten with long term use?
B001NJC5QY|3|Ended up just using this for a bath helper, she play sin it now without the circle of toys... that feature was basically useless.
B002ALQ2CM|5|My 7 month old absolutely LOVES his Taggie Tiger!  He has become his security blanket, he loves sucking/chewing on the tags and also just flicking them/rubbing them.      Great purchase!
B00AH8IUKM|5|I use these for doublers....i like how skinny they are --its why I bought them! I wrap a prefold around them for night time in a bumgenious and it works amazing!!! Very little leaks!
B0000D9SR8|1|As you can tell from my title, I hate this item.  It has a partial swivel seat, which is okay, but if you want to move the child in the other direction forget it.  The piece that goes over the side of the tub doesn't fit larger (soakers or jaccuzi )tubs because it is too narrow, and it fits poorly over standard size tubs as well.      It also doesn't drain very well, and the seat that is on it can get  caught in the up position and pinch the child's leg.  They really need to redesign this product or pitch it.
B00APSYDFK|5|These are perfect for apple slices, chips, pretzels, carrots, etc. I wouldn't recommend leaving food in it for more than 1 day since its not air tight or leak proof
B0052SG1SU|5|Very easy to assemble and it's definitely study.
B00IYTTO2Y|5|Easy to fill and remove frozen milk because the silicone is so pliable unlike my plastic trays.  The plastic tray allows you to place in the freezer without spilling.  Washed on the top rack of dishwasher.  Would buy again.  3 cubes makes a 4 ounce bottle.
B000G80RW2|4|Cute, fuzzy hat is going to be perfect for my little one this winter.  Didn't give it five stars though because there is not much \\"give\\" in the hat.  It really won't last beyond the 6 month mark, I am sure.  And it might not even fit if your baby has a larger head (my daughter is only in the 10th percentile for head size at 4 months and it fits snug).
B000NPHEAG|5|My boobs are huge (38G) and these are the only breastshields that fit me.  BTW- These also fit the Hygeia Q breastpump attachments.
B0018JWAF0|3|Upon first review of this bottle, I was expecting something a bit better. I am not a huge fan of the design, which is 3 different parts (this can be tricky to remember at a 1 am feeding) and if you forget a part and shake the bottle, you are now wearing it as well. Pros: Definitely like the fact it comes with a cap for the nipple for the on the go person, also the fact it holds 8 oz is great as well for the hungry baby. Cons: Design with multiple items you have to remember to put in. Also, did not see any reduction in gas.
B0057ECYS0|1|I bought this a few months ago used it twice and now it doesn't work?? Just won't turn on.. Anyone having problems with this product?
B00G692FK2|4|looks good in nursery. lot of smaller pieces took alil time to put up but looks good. Wife is happy im happy
B002W5RT9Q|5|My wife and I are expecting our first child in a few weeks and we live in a split level home. We needed a gate and being that we live in a split level, we preferred to have one that swung and could be latched. We registered for, and received, a more expensive gate. It was a pressure gate that swung and latched. I thought I wanted a pressure gate so I did not have to make holes in the wall...I was wrong. If you look at most hinged pressure gates they have one thing in common: a bottom bar. The bottom bar is needed to maintain the pressure and keep the gate in place. The problem with this is the bottom bar is a MAJOR TRIPPING HAZARD. Why would anyone want to put a gate at the top of the stairs that had a bottom bar. Think of how many times you walk the stairs...now how many of those times are you carrying something in your hands?     Back to point: We tried another latching hinged gate that was a pressure mount without the bottom bar, but it dented the wall because so much pressure was needed since there was no bottom bar.     This gate is a GREAT price! It is half the price of one of the other gates we tried and a third the price of the other. On top of the great price it is also very easy to install and operate; it can be operated one handed. The neutral color is nice, but it is unfinished so it will show grease from hands. Being that it is unfinished, and sanded very nicely, a coat of paint or stain can easily be applied.     I do not feel it is flimsy or cheaply made. It will slightly shake when installed properly and latched, but this is just the way the gate latched.     I have no problems or concerns using this gate, and when our kid starts walking we will purchase another one for the stairs going to the basement.     Overall, buy it. It's the best gate for the price...easy install...well built...and sturdy.
B00BH0P1E2|4|A lot smaller than I was hoping for my 17month old. Good concept for a sippy straw cup.
B000056JIE|4|I bought these to use during the day at work and so far they've worked great. They're easy to wash and dry, I just throw them in with my regular clothes. I didn't give it 5 stars because you can't wear these with thin clothes or they show. I wear them with a bra that has light padding so it works great that way, but if you wear a thin bra with a silk shirt or dress it would show. I love them though and I still have an unopened box of disposable bra pads that I received as a gift and will probably not use. I bought two packs and might get another one so that I don't have to wash them during the week. Why buy disposables? Seems pretty wasteful to me.
B00S2A8FAM|3|The largest bag isn't THAT large and there isn't a long shoulder strap for easy carrying. It's still a cute ensemble.
B002LARFR8|5|work well.
B0057EEC44|2|Totally thought I'd give these a shot, but I'm here to tell you the novelty has worn off.  Don't buy these.  The glow doesn't last long enough to really do anything.  You're better off using a regular pacifier.
B002GAY07Q|4|These spoons do the job. Stain easily but that's no biggie. I don't have a dishwasher so maybe they wouldn't stain so easily if you had one. I like them, good size for little mouths
B000BSQHL2|1|As per other reviews, we were very excited to use this product to mark a special time in our 1st child's life.  Sadly, we were disappointed. The frame came with a decently sized portion of the black finish chipped off, obviously making the frame less than ideal to display.   But the biggest problem is the clay.  It was impossible to use properly. It stuck to everything. It was hard to remove from the package (I had to scrape it out from the inside of the foil bag and couldn't get it all), it stuck to my hands, the aluminum foil they tell you to place it on, and worst of all, it basically sticks like glue to the rolling pin they included. There was no way to make the clay flat or clean for my baby's foot.  I tried anyway, and his foot just stuck to it, messing it up even further. We could not use it.  I followed all the directions exactly. There was no salvaging this thing. I'm very disappointed with this product and would not recommend it to anyone.  Maybe the clay goes bad? I'm not sure, we received it as a gift and used it 3 months later.  If the clay expires they should indicate so.
B0043C5XYY|4|I received the Bamboobies ultra thin nursing pads as a gift at my baby shower. I had never heard of them before, but I'm so glad I had a friend in the know! They are the most comfortable nursing pads I've used, and love that they are washable. They hold up well and are pretty smooth under your bra/shirts. I'm going to purchase the overnight Bamboobies to try out as well - can't wait! These will definitely be a go-to gift for my pregnant friends.
B000U5FOT2|5|We needed a way to keep our dogs off our deck. This worked perfectly. It is strong, attractive and easily assembled. We do not use it as a pen but a fence.
B00PTL0CDA|2|I just returned this swing because my 11lb baby would not rock in it. It would have been awesome if it worked. Extremely easy to put together and it folded up real small to take with us places.<br />But I think my baby was too heavy for it
B003H4QFPA|4|I have this stroller in red (nice color of red) and I love it so far.  My baby is only 10 weeks old, so we have only been using it to walk, but will start running with it soon and don't for see any changes in my opinion.  It does not have an adjustable handle bar, but I am 5'9\\" and it fits me great.    Pros: swivel front wheel, large basket, parent tray with deep cup holder and zipper compartment for keys/phone, rain cover, large sun shade (this is the BEST), nice large wheels with shocks, easy to put together, large night reflectors, easy to fold and unfold, smooth ride.    Cons: short on head space for older kids (age 4 and up; this is the reason I only gave it 4 stars), not very easy to lay the seat back and when you do it wiggles back and forth a little when you run (only a concern for tiny babies)
B00LD68J0S|5|Only ones my baby will use!!
B000WJLKQM|5|The kid loves it!  Easy to setup and adjust, definitely recommended.
B0083SXA76|5|Very sturdy and toddler friendly.  We already had a monster snack holder, so we wanted another monster item.  This fork and spoon are nice and wide so the food gets picked up easily.
B009YSYD20|5|not use now. i hope it pretty well. my friends who used told me AVENT Breast pumps was good.<br /><br />i hope it true.
B004WPKWNO|5|It looks great on the kids playroom. good quality, easy to put on the walls
B000056HK2|4|I just recieved the pad in the mail today and it seems very nice but I have to return it becuase it is too long for my (IKEA)changing table/dresser.  Who would have thought to measure!! So please measure your table before your order a pad... or plan on sawing it in half:) <br />
B000BNQC58|5|My grandchildren love it.
B000N0SNHY|5|terrific!  great for cleaning the little nipples too!
B00ZCL7YJM|5|Works perfect for my one year old. Only thing I had to change was the vent in my Chris not round. More rectangle shape.  Had to adjust that to work properly.
B00CMQ7Z12|4|Got foe a road trip and my son didn't like it or want it. Its inconvenient because id have to pull off the interstate when he was yelling at me yo take it off. Gave it four stars because it worked fine but it just wasn't for him. I recommend buying a much cheaper one and seeing if they even like it first. Cause if they don't you're out $30 :/
B000CS9TN4|5|[[ASIN:B000CS9TN4 BabyBjörn Little Potty - Green]]    I was surprised by the size of this potty when I received it!  It was much smaller than I expected.  But it has been PERFECT for our son!  It's very simple and uncomplicated.  And it's easy to clean.  It is GREAT for potty training on the go!  We take this potty it us everywhere!!!  I would definitely recommend this potty!!!!
B009A7VTVS|5|Live the keekaroo!
B008T7RDD8|5|I gave this to my grandson he loves angry birds a lot. I thought the product was well made and it seems to endure a lot of use as it has been used many times but, has help together really nicely.
B004JPKM9G|5|Great for a nursery or little girls room, better quality than I expected, easy to hang.  Runs very smooth and quiet.
B00G5DVCKS|5|I love the WiFi baby camera for many reasons but the support I got from Gary was by far the best thing about this product! We had an issue with the first camera we received but Gary helped me get it figured out within a day (on a weekend) and sent me the information to exchange it. Our new camera came within the week and Gary helped me get it set up! Amazing!
B00952P7PC|5|Love these cups because they work with only a little leaking out of spout. And don't have to deal with valves! And no headache if they get left. One thing we noticed, they get easier to screw on and off with use.
B00A24T3FC|5|I purchased this for my son who just turned two. This is his all time favorite toy. This was a replacement for the first one he had that still lights up but no longer plays music. He bangs on it, spins it, and sometimes drops it over the side of his crib. It has held up well considering the abuse. I highly recommend this toy. Co sidering the price, I had no reservations replacing it. Thanks.
B000056OUH|5|Great sterilizer. saved us a lot of time over boiling<BR>everything. Very convenient. Recommend using rubber<BR>dishwashing gloves to remove from microwave if you are<BR>in a hurry.
B004NIH7ZG|5|I have three kids, but I only got this seat with my third child.  Because all three kids share one tub, I wanted something small that wouldn't be a hassle to move around or clean.  This seat is amazing!  It is small, lightweight, and inexpensive.  It easily stores on the tub wall or inside a cabinet or linen closet.  My baby girl was very secure in this seat from her first tub bath at two weeks until she outgrew the seat around six months.  I sat with her, but she never once slipped or slumped down--it provides excellent support at just the right angle, even for a tiny newborn.  With my other two children, I had a tub with sling--the sling was always hard to clean, and it never sat down in the water, so the baby was always cold.  With this seat, the baby is down in the water and can kick and splash, so bath time is so fun.  The only issue I had at all was my daughter wasn't quite ready to sit up well in the tub when she outgrew this, so we had to buy another baby tub for about a month (I actually bought and returned 3 different ones because I couldn't find one I liked as well as this!).  I wish for that reason, the seat was slightly bigger.  But I would buy it again 10 times over for the months of use we got out of it.
B00DEJUZOK|4|Not having experience with any other diaper covers (yet), I bought these and started using with my son when he was about 8 pounds. They were huge on him before that. Hey have been great! They contain wet and soiled diapers better than disposable diapers, unless they are totally soaked. The gussets seem snug but comfortable. We use them during the daytime only.
B00BZAKR7A|5|Very soothing. And I love that it will stay on all night. But the biggest problem is it will get left on for days!
B002V92XAS|5|Perfect for keeping odors at bay.
B002XNK2VO|3|Hi everyone! Well i have got the pillow a month ago and i am currently 34 weeks pregnant..so it was necessary that i support my body during sleep.All and all the pillow works great although i did not realize that it cannot get under the side of my belly when i was purchasing.Don't know if that is what happens with all body pillows because i never had one before but i have been using a regular pillow under my side before getting this one and that was quite helpful. So, do i recommend the pillow otherwise?Yes, only if you don't mind that it doesn't stay under the side of your pregnant belly. Hope my review was helpful. Have fun with the belly!
B00I4CAIXA|5|Baby loves. Works great for teething. Baby can hold well and nice soft rubber for chewing.
B00BNEBL6E|4|It's works good when my baby was little! Now he is 3months old the tub so small for him already .
B0036WTFXC|5|This pacifier clip is a great way to keep up with the necessary soother.  The monogram makes it personal and attractive. Nice item.
B006ZVV0NO|1|Cheap Material,<br /><br />Look bad from outside.
B00083D754|5|simple toy that 5 month old frequently chooses over other toys. So it is a win
B004G8QSY4|5|My 2 year old grandson loves it, and it is being passed on to my younger (9 months old) grandson.  He is also intrigued by it.
B000F1QV1Q|5|My baby just turned four months when I ordered this walker in February. Although the pediatrician recommended no walkers at this age, I used my judgement and decided since our home was one level, and I am home all day, I could watch my baby safely while he was in the walker. When the walker arrived, I read the instructions and assembled the walker in 20 minutes. I place him in the walker and used some baby blankets to help prop his trunk muscles so he could sit upright. He didn't cry and this was all new to him. I pushed, pulled him until he told me he was tired. He's now five months and can propel himself backwards and side to side in small steps. He hasn't moved forward too much, but of course that will change. In short, this walker is safe, durable and resonable priced. The colors and rocket shape is a bit funky retro. I did remove two items off the \\"control panel\\", the two arched movable toys, because it was too much. The nice thing as well as the control panel comes off completely to reveal a tray. The seat also easily detaches and just throw it in the washer/dryer. Rest of the walker can be cleaned by wiping with soap and water. There are three height level adjustments to the walker. And the walker collapes for storage. To summerize, I would definately recommend this walker, for it's durablility, practicality and to increase motor skills, perception for the baby.
B00005NT6A|2|I bought this humidifier for my new baby daughter and was shocked at the daily and weekly maintenance required.  It requires minor cleaning daily and major cleaning weekly.  Who has time with a baby in the house?  In addition, it was very noisy and as we co-sleep, the noise was a problem for all of us.  I sent it back the very next day.
B007OWHDS4|1|These did not work well for us. They were broken within a week.
B005XJ2VHI|2|Loved this high chair when I registered for it! And I still loved it after my 6 month old started to use it. But once my son turned 10 months old he easily figured out how to remove the tray from the chair. He did it by accident the first time, but then decided it was a fun game to pop the tray off while it was full of food! HUGE mess for every meal from then on. We tried to figure out a way to block our son from reaching around to grab the release buttons on the sides. But we couldn't come up with a solution. The release buttons are huge and take no effort to push and pop off the tray. Easy enough for a 10 month old.<br /><br />Sadly we had to give up the chair after a few short months! We ended up going with a smaller high chair that attaches to a regular chair at the table. And I thoroughly inspected each high chair tray before buying!! Not sure why Graco didn't see how easily the tray could be removed by a baby.<br /><br />So as long a your kid doesn't figure out how to release the tray on their own you are good. But once they figure it out it's all over!
B0030XN93Y|5|I actually bought this same one and just received it at jcp but i am simply in love with it. It has sturdy sides, and very deep. Seems so secure. Is real wicker, not plastic. Now there is a slight downfall. The inside is plastic bottom and a heavy waxed papery sides Then has the wicker on the outside. I opted and went ahead and ordered a bassinet liner to go with it. It would have been cheaper to go ahead and buy the combo. It is very cute, especially the hood. The mattress yet thin, when in place is very comfortable and I feel enough padding to work. Very solid for the size of baby it will hold. My husband was so impressed he told me to order his sister one for her baby shower. He is such a stickler for quality, so that is saying alot. WOuld recommend to anyone. with our first child we borrowed a cloth/metal frame type and the sides fell down twice with our baby in it, so I wanted to be sure there would be no possible way for my baby to fall out of this one and there is no way. There is a reason this style has been around for years and years!
B0043IS18I|4|We purchased this to use for our 5-month-old's stroller. We live in Florida, where the weather in winter and spring can range from the 40s to the upper 80s, so we wanted it have a portable option to keep him cool in his stroller. Up until recently, he's been in his car seat clipped into the stroller, and he can overheat really easy since he is so snug. We have clipped the fan onto the end of his car sear, neat his feet, so the fan blows on his face. It blows a decent gentle breeze, and the soft foam blades don't hurt him at all when he touches them with his feet (often). My only complaint is that due to the soft nature of the foam blades, they sometimes get bent and bump into the body of the fan. All it takes is a quick adjustment to fix that though, so just a minor irritation. Overall, really pleased with this fan! Would buy again.
B000VAV2HO|5|they are good value for the cost, serves the purpose.. have been using since 2 months,they are soft,dry quickly,easy to wash,keeps the baby warm when wrapped after bath.
B00RZTLLAW|5|The best nursing cover I have ever used!! It will be my new go-to gift for expecting moms.
B000C4Y1A4|4|The nipple and nipple material is very breastlike for the baby.  The only drawback is there is a rubber piece in the bottom that the air is supposed to seep through.  I don't think that it always works because I see air going through the nipple.  Also you have to make sure that rubber piece is in just right or the bottle will leak.  The wide mouth is easy to clean and like I said the nipple shape is very nice.
B006X4HYCE|5|love this stroller! it is light and easy to use. i like that it doesn't look clunky and the bottom basket it super spacious. i was really drawn to this stroller for the front-facing and parent-facing feature. it is a bit on the pricey side, highly recommend it just the same.
B00KU10ZSQ|5|Was great delivery Was fast i LOVE It!
B007BI8GEQ|4|gr8
B00009IMCK|5|good
B003VTZKOI|3|This product is fine for what it is, a walker for babies. I bought it in part for the price, and because I thought I wanted my baby to be able to &#34;walk&#34; around. Well in hindsight, after trying it out, I am not ready for him to have this much mobility. I wish I had returned this and purchased a STATIONARY bounce activity center of some sort. However I kept this, and I have an area where I put the baby in it and turn him loose. A nice long hallway would work well with this product. I have learned that babies can learn to stand and walk without such mobility as this provides, and they are easier to keep and eye on when stationary.
B00IRH7RQI|5|Well, I think it's fabulous and it worked perfectly but as soon as I bought it, he gave up pacifiers. So...now he just chews on the clip instead of the pacifier.
B0019QCGVK|5|This is one of those toys that is a must for teething babies! Has Five different textures on each corner to chew on and has a papery kind of feeling to center that fascinates babies with it's sound and feel. My 6 month old granddaughter loves hers!
B006LKX0Y6|3|Baby never got the hang of it
B004OR1DUG|3|Cool looking cup.  My daughter liked it because it was so different.  It is not the easiest to clean though.  I do put it in the dishwasher and seems to get clean, just not sure how long it will last.  Love Boon products though!
B00LZKBSKA|3|The instructions state this thing can carry kids up to 4 years old and 45 pounds weight, with the child on your back. They picture a person starting with the \\"pouch\\" at the front, placing the child in, swiveling the waist belt around like it is on ball bearings and the child passes under your armpit and zing he or she is on your back.<br /><br />Well our kid is just over 2 years old and 30 pounds weight. I basically could not swivel the waist belt with her loaded, and could not pass her under my armpit while simultaneously putting my other arm through the shoulder strap. Finally my wife helped me, but then the cross-strap was either choking my throat or else the pouch was way too tight for the child.<br /><br />I believe this outfit will be much better for front carry of the (hopefully) smaller baby my wife is expecting to give birth to in another six weeks. The overall quality seems excellent, the stitching is strong, and the shoulder straps are thickly padded. But for older kids of 30 to 45 pounds, I cannot recommend it.
B000A32PNW|1|CON: The folding causes a weird gap - where little fingers or toes can get caught. This is really scary for the baby & parent. The gap in the fold is also quite sharp feeling & I'm afraid you could get cut or possibly lose a finger if you were not paying attention.  PRO: I bought this to save space. Which is great - because it folds up nicely & fits on a shelf.  That said - I am very disappointed & will be purchasing something else. Don't waste your money if safety is a concern. The Con outweighs the Pro for me - and I will lose space, rather than a finger.
B002R765EY|3|This is an ok product, It could be better like the kneeling area could be a little bit bigger and I'm a small person so, otherwise the pockets and that it attaches to the bath tub is great cause I have shampoo, wash cloth and body wash at hand that is nice. But it serves it porpouse later on I'll get a kneeling pad with a bigger area for my knees cause that's the main reason you get this :)
B00005YYE3|3|The product is great, and we have used them many times before. This is the first time we order them from Amazon and are disappointed of what we received. The cups were pink, with butterflies and flowers! Nothing our boys can actually use! I know the description says \\"colors and design vary\\", but none of the pictures show anything similar to what we got. If the designs are not unisex, ten at least there should be an option to select boys' or girls' designs.
B000YPEUUW|3|pretty but not sturdy.  arrived loose in the pot.
B002UXQRES|5|These bags have held up well for me. I have been through two boxes and working on my third and have never had a leak or break. I don't use the measuring lines on the side as those can be undependable just because the shape of the bag can vary depending on how it unfolds. I pump in a bottle then transfer to the bags so I just write the oz. I read on the bottle on the bag. I have had milk frozen for up to three months with no problems.
B007IV17PQ|5|Good
B001GQ2P78|2|I bought two different sound machines.  I was attracted to this one because of the option to plug in my mp3 player, as well as the night light.  Fresh out of the package the power was intermittent because the cord would not keep a snug fit into the back of the machine.  In comparison to another and cheaper sound machine I bought, this one seems not as well made.  This machine has a great option of other noises besides white noise and nature, but the volume cannot go as loud as the other one I bought.  It is getting returned.
B004FI2P88|3|My wife bought these and gave up trying to install them. She ended up having me do the job. I recommend having some mechanical ability if you purchase these or they will end up in a drawer or garage.
B000YMUTOG|5|The product is as shown and described, good purchase.  It folds up small, but is large enough for our 24\\" baby to be completely protected from public changing tables. :-)
B009X4C796|3|I originally reviewed the Maxi Cosi as a higher quality seat than the Chicco Nextfit.  I was wrong.  Very wrong!  I can only hope that I didn't lead too many people astray; but for those that I may have, then if you are unhappy with the MC, see whether you can still return it or not.  I like having Amazon Prime for that reason... it's so easy to order AND return things for FREE!<br />Anyway, I have owned the MC, the Recaro convertible carseat, and the Chicco Nextfit. Unfortunately, I don't have time at the moment to review all the features of each, but for a high quality, deep reclining, amazingly comfortable for baby, compact, easy-to-install seat... I now choose the Chicco.  I got the \\"Juno\\" color first... which stains very easily; and for that reason I can't recommend that color. The second seat I ordered was the Mystique color; and it's great, hides dirt and looks very classy.  The seat material is very plush and high quality; the straps work easily, and the latch cinch feature is awesome! I hope this helps someone!  I found my seat on a 25% off sale at Albee Baby and got it for $209r than some cheap reflective \\"stuff\\"  The Chicco is pretty good on space, too... but of course my preference is the MC.  Good luck!
B0043IS18I|3|Great fan while it worked but it broke after only using it a few times. I hope the seller sends us another one.
B008HCXIU2|5|I searched hi and low to find a mirror to attach to the headrest so that I could see the baby while he was in the back seat. After much patience and reading other reviews, this is the one!! I'm very happy with it and the baby loves it cause he can see me too!! Awesome!!
B0061PIHOE|5|I don't have kid's by my own but, this product save my nephew life... It really woke up my sister when my 5 month old nephew stop breathing.. So I got it aging for my causins new born
B0007ORN7M|5|This is an awesome baby sitter. Our son is almost 8 months old and still has trouble sitting by himself and this is fantastic. We put him in it to sit on the back patio, at restaurants, when we feed him, etc.<br /><br />Just be careful they can fall over. Our baby is a little tall for his age and he can push himself and fall with the bumbo to one side (he did this in our bed so he didn't hurt himself, thank Goodness).<br /><br />It is a great product though. It will definitely give your baby a new view of the world.
B002VBXY68|1|Bought this swing because for the price it had the best reviews. Couldn't be more disappointed. I admit I didn't buy it from Amazon--we got it at BRU, but I don't see how that matters. This swing is super cute, I love the style. And it was very easy to assemble, took me 15 minutes. But once assembled it became obvious that the frame for the seat is severely bent, making it so cock-eyed that it rubs against the main frame when it swinngs. Also, the speeds are a joke. Even on the highest setting, it barely moves and our baby is only 9 pounds. I am returning it tomorrow and buying a different swing.
B002WN2BY6|4|My husband and I use this monitor in a 3000 sq. ft, 2-story house.  The baby's nursery is upstairs, and the monitors work well all over the house, including on the front porch and in the garage.  We are happy with the lack of interference, particularly because certain parts of our house have a metal roof, and we've had trouble with interference in other wireless devices.<br /><br />The parental units are small and portable.  Having two separate parental units is a real benefit (many monitors only have one unit).  The sound quality is not always great or clear, but it works for us most of the time.
B000056OV0|5|This is the only tub you need.  It works for infants up to 3 year olds.  Our newborn uses one side and the older toddler uses the other side.  It is so multi-tasking.  If you buy a newborn tub, you will be buying this one shortly thereafter because your newborn will outgrow the small one so quickly.  Highly recommend.
B000VKCGTM|1|Maybe I just got a dud, but mine fell apart in no time.  For starters, the tab that attaches the pad to the changing table has torn off the pad.  I tried to sew it back on but the part where it attaches to the pad is pretty shredded.  It's also splitting at the seams on the top - not such a big deal as we use a cover, but still.  My prior changing pad lasted through 5 kids- this one has lasted one kid 4 months.  We can't continue to use it because it's slipping of the table.  It's a shame because the 3 sided design is nice- just not durable.
B000056IZE|5|Have had this gate installed in our hallway with heavy traffic for a long time now, and it still works perfect. Yeeeaaah!
B0018Z35DA|5|I loved the thought of my grandson relaxing and falling asleep to this wonderful little &#34;Baby Einstein Neptune Soother &#34;  He enjoys it so much.  Happy I got it for him.
B003IT4YAM|5|I was between this one and the Diono .. I'm pretty sure both are great seats,  this one have a nice color combination, plus all the safety bells and whistles ..  one thing that sold me on this one it's how fresh are the fabrics used around your little one.
B00JU3JMHK|4|They look and feel nice. So nice that my 9 month old likes to take them off and chew on them. They stick right back on pretty well, though. They work as intended.
B008HPP67C|5|I couldn't have asked for more from a pillow for my toddler. It is just firm enough and he loves it!
B00F7QUPH0|5|I am super happy about these food pouches.  Our entire family uses them, great for schools lunches, breakfast on the go and snacks at work!  This is just another element to eating well as my family deserves to with out the added junk from the store bought products.
B0031ARQLC|5|Good and solid. Delivered earlier than promised.
B007C88GW2|5|bought this for my 2 yr old and the first time he used it, he finished his milk in 2-3 mins. i bought different brands before when he turned 1 but none of those he really liked until got this one.
B0038JDVBK|4|I love the brush but the nipple cleaner part is useless.
B005PK1CCU|3|Its was ok doesn't throw allot of air but it does a bit of a good job.
B001I481LM|5|love it
B001I7PY1E|5|I like this product. For two bathtub in my house, it has this product in it. It is so nice when I step on it during shower. Thank you for this product.
B00GSP5BVE|5|so far the only brand that really worked without getting onto the baby's face while we are sleeping.
B006V84KFQ|4|Sometimes the lids are a little bit hard to get on and off, but its true they don't leak!
B00064ATVK|5|I bought this pump when my daughter was three months old.  Upon using it at work, I realized that my milk supply was SERIOUSLY dwindling and I couldn't figure out why.  I pumped three or four times per day at work, and could only get three to four ounces of milk per pumping session, on a good day!  Talk about stressing me out! <br />I talked to a lactation consultant who explained to me that this pump isn't good for frequent pumpers, because IT ONLY PUMPS ONE SIDE AT A TIME.  Yes, it is a DOUBLE electric, but the suction alternates one side and then the other.  This means that in a ten minute pumping session, each breast only gets five minutes worth of pumping time.  This obviously results in much less suction time than you would spend nursing, thus the reduction in your milk supply.  Since I already had low supply, this pump almost ended my nursing! <br />So steer clear of this pump and purchase the advanced pump in style if you plan to do any kind of long term pumping, like at work, for extended periods of time, or if you have to increase your supply.  There is a reason that the advanced pump in style costs more: It works 100% better, is more sturdy, quieter, reliable, and will keep up your supply. <br />This double electric pump is awkward at best, and I would spill my milk bottles and get milk into the tubing all the time.  With that kind of stress, it's hard to relax for the let down.  Also, the suction was really painful to my  nipples. <br />I'm glad that some people have had good results with this pump, but it totally did not work for me.  As a matter of fact, mylactation consultant told me that she wouldn't recommend this pump for anyone. Too many problems, when the advanced works beautifully. <br />Trust me, spend the money one time on the better pump; it's worth it!
B0038OLMXE|5|I'm very happy with the gate. It's tall enough that we don't have to bend over to open it. It's easy to open by just lifting and swinging open, and it closes automatically unless pushed all the way open where it locks in the open position when not needed for a barrier.
B00C6NG20G|5|I live in an area that has many spanish speaking residents. So I thought this would be a fun (but necessary) way to get the message across. It came quickly and is a great quality sign. It looks a bit more brown than gray in the picture but it's still a great looking sign.<br /><br />Also my interactions with Pixy Ink were professional and very friendly. She went above and beyond when I goofed with my shipping address. Great customer service! :)
B008MHFRO2|3|This would be 5 stars if it the mat kept its color. When wiping it off, the color comes also. We have had the mat a month and I am guessing that by the time we have had it six months, the pictures will be pretty sad looking.
B00BWRPB8G|5|Babies not due until july!!! But love it already!
B006SFUCV8|5|I initially did not know this was a rack to hold baby bottles and stuff. I did not return it because I needed a rack to place my glass cup to dry and this got the job done beautifully. I am not using the top rack or the stick, I just use the rotating rack to place my cups on. I like the fact that it spins and has a compartment to collect the water. It is also very easy to clean. Best mistake purchase I have made.
B006JV4HFS|5|So much nicer for little ones than most restaurant high chairs. This was indispensable to us! Easy to carry and easy to wash, sturdy and comfortable for baby.
B00CGF1Y20|3|The product is good.  However after eight months is dropped they do shatter.  I had five bottles do this when dropped.  I think the plastic just wears out over time.  Also the price on this product is awful.... Buy it at the store for four bucks.
B008P8EZOG|5|The price of this camera is what attracted me but the functionality won me over
B0039ONN5S|5|These things extend the life of your microphones, but do get nasty over time. I bought multiple packs at this great price & put them on all the vocal mics for the band with more in reserve for the future. Perform as well as higher priced ones.
B009Z4W140|5|Good wide no slip base. Perfect for my little ones so they don't turn the stool over when on their tip toes.  Super light and easy for them to move too
B00529MA66|5|Worked great for my little guy, he liked much better then the velcro sacks, because he could move his arms around inside.  was easy to just zip partially and leave his arms out as well when he started to roll over and it was time to wean him off the swaddle
B001ECHXVC|5|This is the best product ever.  Wish I had gotten it sooner for my daughter, who just turned 3.  She loves being able to help at the counter and I have the peace of mind knowing that she is safe from falling.  So easy to assemble.
B000YDDF6O|4|Baby loves the music and it's easy to hold. Hope she doesn't bonk herself in the head.
B00I9RGUWI|3|My mom bought this at a shop for my 1 year old when we visited.  I'm glad we have it, although I would like to replace it with something similar the next time we are in the States because there is a problem with the front wheels. One is not balanced at all, and there is grip whatsoever on smooth floors and even on concrete requires more force to push than a stroller of this weight should.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />SUPER lightweight<br />Extremely easy to fold and load in a car<br />Takes minimal storage room<br />No obstruction on the sides- curious little ones have a 180 view<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />Requires two hands to push<br />Front wheels are wonky (see above)<br />Not the most comfortable grip<br />Low handles are just barely comfortable for me to grip, and I am only 5'5&#34;- anyone taller would really have to slouch<br />No basket, cupholder, etc.
B004BSFOTO|4|I haven't actually given this &#34;Taggy&#34; as my great grandaughter won't be born until 1st Jan, it may well be a 5* then, prompt delivery, very good quality, wonderfully coloured. My own children loved the satin edge on blankets, I'm sure that our baby will be taken with all its attractive qualities
B003C0CFN0|5|Love this product i have a baby on the way and I cant wait for her to show these off!!
B00O8RRYGE|4|Definitely too big for a new born, but it's still nice.
B001AT58VG|5|I got a rattle for my son as a gift and then bought him a lovie.  I have bought the &#34;pair and a spare&#34; lovies for a friends shower and then bought a different friend this rattle.  Everything is so soft and I feel comfortable with the construction that he can &#34;taste&#34; all he wants and nothing will come loose.
B003LQQGE4|5|I got this for my daughter for Christmas, I gotta say our family members have other ones for her to play in but this one has the most spacious seat, spins easy so she likes playing with all toys, has hooks for extra links to hang toys off of and is Great!!  I recommend this one to anyone over alll the other ones I've tried
B004J35K2C|5|I really like this car seat. It is very soft, comfortable and very easy to adjust straps and buckle up my boy. Only negative i would have is that the \\"recline\\" is definitely just a marketing nitch.
B004L2JJ78|5|This product is great. This is exactly what I was looking forward to support my infant's neck in his car seat. A lot of the other inserts were too big since he is a big baby. The fact that this sits under his head and prevents his head from flopping to the side was perfect. I was afraid that this would be too big based on the picture but in fact it's the perfect size, not too large. My baby is about 16 pounds FYI.
B002OCDA04|2|I have had this product for a little over a month and I have been using it for my twins.  I always put the seats in the tub and then fill with water.  My daughter is 16 lbs and when I picked her up the bottom of the seat was busted out.  This product costs way to much to get so little use out of it.  VERY disappointed
B001NJC5QY|5|We had the Bumbo seat but I had some concerns about baby's safety in it.  I did some research and came across this chair.  Baby loves it!  It's nice that, unlike the bumbo, I can set some of her toys on the tray or she can play with the ones attached.  When she sits in this chair she looks like she's plotting a Dr Evil style global take over, so we call it her world domination chair.  Too cute!
B00GJX94G8|1|Do not purchase this for a toddler bed. This cover is only large enough for a crib. The statement on the package, and on the Amazon site, that it fits a standard crib and toddler bed is false. This cover is too small for a toddler bed. Frustrated at false claim that wastes my time and money (due to shipping costs).
B00FNV6352|2|POOR PRODUCT, the print/paint wore off, I cant read the measurements anymore and haven't had it very long. BE CAREFUL IT LEAKS!
B0055ME11C|5|No reaction, no sensitivity issues, just clear, beautiful skin on my 7 month old grandson. GREAT product!
B002FIROM2|3|this is an ok product the materials seem a little cheap especially the plastic clip.  we have better luck tying it to a favorite toy and having my daughter hang on to the toy.  she can take it off of herself no matter what way we attach it to her.  it is just good to keep her from wandering off during oh shiny moments
B000096LWK|3|We have used thses for over 8 years in the family, they do leak when you turn them over, but i really liked them for my older son.  now my 15 month old tends to spill his drink on the floor and play with it so i am in the market for new cups, otherwise i would have just replaced the straws of my old ones and used them for the younger child
B00F18FN08|5|Great For the price ;) more cushion for an older toddler not in need of a firmer mattress.
B008K02VGI|5|Love! Music plays for a long time to get baby to sleep.  No more restarting and waking them up. Works like a charm. Lights up and baby loves it. We have been using it for months now and it gets used every nap and bedtime.
B00BPYXVHO|3|Its kind of small...looks bigger in the picture than in person....gets dirty really quickly.
B004ZHXWB8|4|This seat is AWESOME. I love that the leg area accommodates chunky thighs. It is very well made and easily wipes clean. We started using this with our daughter around 3 months. She is 6 months now and still using it everyday. I love that it will grow with her (since the insert comes out). It is a bit pricier that other baby seats, but I think the quality, design and versatility make up for the price. You will be able to use this seat much longer than other brands because it will grow with your baby. My only complaint is that it is a little difficult to pick up. It'd be nice if there was a notch on the underside to make it easier to pick up--but with that said, I think it is very stable so while it is hard to pick up, it would be even harder to tip over! Highly recommend.
B00020V5A2|2|I bought this monitor and it functions ok. We are looking to selling it and buy another brand that has a stronger reception. We have a 3700 Sqft home and does not work everywhere in the house....not good.. <br />When our 900 hz phone is used, it kills unit.
B000SXP7O8|1|I found just the right replacement straws at[...].  It is made by Nuby.  You can purchase an 1, 5, or 10-pack.  The part name is Nuby Replacement Straw Fat Oval Straw Kit.      Pay attention to notes on the old and new design.  Though my FlipIt cups are a few years old, they are of the new straw design and I am able to use these straws.  Much older cups will not be able to.  (I would buy the replacement kit mentioned by jgrimm19.)
B000083JTJ|4|I was given this as a shower gift and was hesitant to use it because of the reviews it was given.  Once I learned how to position it for my baby I have had no problems.  He started out at 7lbs and is now 15lbs.  I am still using it and plan to until he has good head control.  He seems to be comforted by the 'nestled' feeling from it.  I only use the inner portion right now and will upgrade to the outer portion if he needs it.  I do think it needs to have installation instructions included.  Being a new Mom, I initially had it in wrong. I quickly discovered this and corrected the problem, but it really needs to have instructions with it.
B000246T54|1|terrible interferance with both my phones and my computer's wireless network.  couldn't hear anything but static.
B0013FCQIA|5|These bags and system are great. The bags slip over the top of the pail with out any struggle and easily pull down as the diapers fill the pail or once you remove the full bag. The slight scent is nice to help mask odor at times. Simple and easy. No hassle.
B0098YTBCW|1|Did not do what it said in the box, no flap that comes down! Not really all that happy with it. I wish Britax could come up with an attachable umbrella that would clip onto the side and could be maneuvered so you are able block out the sun at any angle.  That would be a better solution.
B001F0RAB6|1|These liners leak, the dropins are a far better product but more expensive of course. Used these 13 years ago and never had this problem. Disappointed.
B00F0YCDJW|5|I have spent hundreds of dollars on nursing pillows.  None of them completely removed the need to hunch over.  This one does the job, is small and soft. I still need to hunch but very little. After feeding, I can noiselessly toss it aside without disturbing my sleeping kid. Fits in a very small space so excellent to travel with
B002CRIQSW|5|The crib came right on time. The box was a bit damaged but I think that happened during shipping when someone tried to move it and wasn't expecting it to be as heavy as it was. There was no problem setting it up (there was a section that did not tell us to screw together which we thought was odd so we did it anyway). The crib itself was not damaged, a little dirty but that's what you get when you buy a white crib. Extremely sturdy, very pleased. Would definitely buy this again.
B00CQWR0DK|5|While I only ended up needing the infant insert for a couple of months, it was worth the cost.  I love my carrier and it allowed me to use one carrier for either of my kids with a simple switch.  The included hood is great to cover baby's head from the sun.  We haven't had a need for the drool pads yet, but I know they will come in handy soon.
B004VL2VRO|5|I gave this item to my children for a Baby Shower Gift. They love it! We went over for dinner this week, Baby was 5 days old. The new parents were able to sit down to eat with the monitor in front of them as Baby slept. They said it was the best present they ever received.
B002L69N9U|4|I ordered the baby sherpa alpha after having my second child, needing a bag that work work for preschooler needs (juice, snacks, lunch) and baby needs (bottles, diapers, wipes, baby food). This is pretty perfect. Only fix? Not enough small interior pockets inside, like a purse. I can't find tiny things easily. Otherwise, really love this backpack.
B000056HNX|3|I purchased a lot of these bottles after reading several great reviews, however my son just doesn't like the nipple.  He was in the NICU for several weeks and got very used to the nipple used at the hospital.  The only bottle he takes well is the gerber bottle that costs about a $1.  Now he is having a lot of gas problems and I am desperate to find a better bottle for him with a similar nipple.  I hope as he gets older he will get used to these bottles.  In the many attempts I have had in using the Avent bottles, I have not had any leaking problems like so many others.
B00009VMMA|5|This stroller is HOT! It has all the makings of a well thought out stroller for both our baby and us! It looks great; we are always being stopped and complimented on both our beautiful baby and the incredible stroller with all the bells and whistles!! It travels wonderful and we have no problem packing it in our SUV or sedan.   We have a darling little girl and she loves it; she sleeps during the walks and while awake she plays with the interactive toys!!   I love it, my husband loves it and she loves it!!!
B001EQ66WK|5|This is fabulous and I wish I had it earlier.  Its perfect for sleep-overs, keeps kids comfy and safe.
B00FRQEYQI|4|My son and daughter-in-law are cloth diapering. GroVia is one of a couple of brands they are trying. I bought this shell for them and they love it. It looks great on their son and will look equally good on a girl.
B001RR3CVE|4|I love this sippy cup since you have to screw it to close it.  It does better than those regular cups that you just snap open.  It sometimes does leak if not close properly but the kids love this cup.  My 5 yr old used this when she was a toddler and now I bought new ones for my 1 year old and he loves it too :)  Finally a cup for my toddler!
B00MOMVAJ2|5|Simply put, this is a great car seat! I really appreciate the design and how well it's constructed, yet it is amazing how light it is! I feel confident my grandson is protected, as well as comfortable in this seat.  The infant insert w/ headrest gives him the snug cuddled feeling and he usually falls asleep after just a few blocks ride.  The design of the click-in base is majorly convient, love it!  Even transferring/installing in another car isn't difficult at all.  But if you should need to for convience, you can purchase a second base separately.  I'm looking into getting the Stroller that this can be dropped into.....love this idea!  I definately recomend this comfortably protective infant seat, it's definately worth every penny for peace of mind on safety and comfort for our little guy.
B00BLIRQ3E|5|I hated to pay this much for this tent when I had seen similar ones for half the price. However, the pad that comes with it, along with the hooks for toys and the bug nets make this tent completely worth it. My only gripe is that it's a little difficult to fold up, even after watching the video multiple times.
B00GCYTNYM|1|Horrible cheap and not worth it.
B00AN7U4UQ|5|I tried this pillow originally as part of the Medcline - Reflux Relief System. It is a fantastic product, and so incredibly soft.<br /><br />I tried another body pillow from a different seller based on the product reviews, but it was much stiffer, heavier and just not comfortable at all.<br /><br />This pillow is long enough to wrap around your body, and oh my! It is like heaven to sleep with. I bought this pillow separately for my mom, who already has an inclined hospital bed.<br /><br />This pillow is more expensive than some others - but if you want a great night's sleep, the extra cost is definitely worth it.<br /><br />Highly recommended, and Amenity Health even followed up with me to ask if I had any questions about the product. Great service and and an even better product!! If you have acid reflux disease, you have to get the Medcline. It is also awesome!!
B004GGQG2A|5|This thing is perfect.  My son loves being able to turn the light on and off without a stool.
B0039VCRPI|4|These wipes are soft, gentle, and work well.  We love using these as an alternative to disposable wipes, and the colors are fun, too.
B00BXWTVB8|3|I ended up returning it because it's too bulky for our space. It does not stay on the faucet snug enough either.
B000XS23FE|4|The material sucks because its kind of thin, but for the price it's a good deal.  My son never sleeps in his crib so it was a waste of money but quality product.
B00849L4AE|5|Baby love, heat preservation performance is good, is worth to recommend，High cost performance，Beautiful patterns for female baby。<br />This is a fantastic product
B005SAZ68I|4|Great Shipping speed love rhe cute product.. it did arrive with a few scratches on the wood but apart from that it was really good
B001H3IQRS|4|I bought this wrap before our baby joined us. It's very handy to have and to use, but she doesn't like being in it very long.  I will take her for walks outside in it, which she falls asleep. But if I wear it around the house, she'll fuss and cry.<br /><br />But it's worth the purchase for getting her to sleep when it has. We have tried other carriers, and this one has been her favorite so far.
B006Y3S838|1|Leaks after a few uses, the pet that holds the straw in place breaks often.
B00CWN3HQM|5|So handy!  A great buy if you are expecting - you will likely use it quite a bit.
B00EU5AL8W|3|This is a great video monitor, but my second camera losses connection very often and that can be annoying ...
B00AHVR94W|5|We purchased 4 of these for our 7.5 year old son.  For 4 different vehicles.  We owned the Graco Nautilus and found it too wide for the kids to buckle for themselves in both the high back and backless mode.  The affix has a smaller footprint.  Still has the great cup holder and a nice cubbie.  We have them installed in a Buick Rainer, Chevy Traverse, Buick Enclave and GMC Truck.  All anchor well and are easy for the child to buckle.  Love the latch so that they are not floating around in the grandparents cars when the kids are not in there.  Just wish there were more fun color choices for boys.  We purchased a davenport off another site, but 3 of these because they were $10 cheaper each.  My son thinks its girly....
B003LM6WF6|3|We bought this for our son in a different color.  We keep it on our first floor so I don't have to go upstairs every time he needs a change.  The height of the changing table made changes in the first few weeks post partum really uncomfortable for me (it made my back hurt for whatever reason).  My biggest problem with this playard is that it is very difficult to clean.  If you have a child who \\"goes\\" whenever his/her diaper is removed, you'll find messes on the changing area.  It then soaks into the fabric of the changing area.  After a week, ours was a little stained, and it's just a mess after 8 weeks.  Another problem with the item is the music player.  It can only go in one location, and it interferes with the operation of the changing table.    It has a really pretty mattress pad, but it doesn't matter to me at all since I cover it with a sheet (washable!) anyway.    These problems are seemingly minor, but do you want even minor problems in a pack n play?
B00418XCZW|1|I was so excited to get this candle and give it as a bridal shower prize.<br />When I received it, I was shocked at how small it was. This size of a<br />grape. I couldn't even use it as a prize. The photo makes it look much<br />bigger than it is.
B003SX0BA0|4|I purchased this &#34;pillow&#34; for my 4 month old daughter who has torticollis. We used it in her infant carrier and it helped to keep her head straight until it became too tight to buckle her in with the Snuggin Go (at nearly 7 months) positioned in the carrier. We will probably begin using it again once we transfer her to a regular sized car seat as it worked great. The only complaint is the price. For such a seemingly basic design, $30+ to $40+ dollars is a rip off.
B001AVNK6E|2|This pacifier looks nice and \\"green\\" but doesn't really perform well. It squishes my baby's nose making her spit it out. Had to return.
B0085CBA90|2|These did not work for me.  I did not get enough suction and ended up not using them.
B003TRZIGW|4|Exactly what I expected, a lightweight stroller for quick trips. Not the best steering, but fine for what I needed. Very glad we got this stroller for an airplane trip!
B004T816IE|5|My 15 mo son loves to use this set to feed himself.
B00020L78M|5|This has worked great for us.  I bought the extender as well and it makes a fairly large area for my LO to play in.  It does not slide around the floor and it doesn't fall when LO pulls himself up on it.    I only wish it wasn't so difficult to snap and unsnap together, but that is the only con.
B00JROOBVE|5|Absolutely adorable on my grand-daughter! Definitely would recommend this! Just a little bit of sassiness for my princess.
B002V92ZIS|3|The quality is good. The thickness of the stainless is good. They'll probably last forever.  Having said that, the bowl is ridiculously small and the plate is small. I think the plate will be too small after he is about 5 years old. The bowl is already too small for my one year old for eating soups or oatmeal. It is probably going to be ok for giving him a small amount of blueberries or cheerios once he is older and able to use a bowl by himself. The set would've been so much more useful if the bowl and the plate was just a bit bigger.  My biggest grip with this is that the cup came with scotch tape on the inside to keep it from moving in the box. The tape was hard to remove and I ended up having to use Goo-Gone to remove the sticky residue from the cup. The whole point of this was to keep chemicals from my baby and I think having to rub Goo-Gone on the cup defeats the purpose.
B004Y99M52|4|I had been eye-ing this carseat since the time I was pregnant. &#34;Back then&#34; the Graco 4ever had not been released. I really liked all the comfort and safety features this seat has to offer. My daughter was getting increasing more uncomfortable in her snugride35 so I started shopping around for a convertible carseat. I had looked into this seat but the price was a huge deterrent. Luckily the day I had committed to buying a new carseat(or two) there was one on Warehouse Deals! I jumped at it...I even got lucky that I decided to wait on a second base and a few days later one popped up on Warehouse Deals as well!.<br />I have been using it for about a week now....<br /><br />Pros-<br />&#60;&#62; Very Well Padded<br />&#60;&#62; Easy Buckle-much easier than my snugride35, also the harness is easy to open up and crotch strap stays forward<br />&#60;&#62; Flip up Arm Rests that Click into up or down position<br />&#60;&#62; Stay in car base. I meet my husband everyday at his work when he gets out and I am commuting in to my job so being able to move the carseat from car to car is nice-however this is not as easy as a snugride its do-able<br />&#60;&#62; Ryker is very sharp looking :)<br /><br />Cons<br />X HEAVY<br />X Unlock from base feature is hard to do and the &#34;Red safety flags&#34; in the seat area make it a pain if child is sleeping and you would like to remove the carseat.<br />X Cupholder is too far away for smaller children<br />X Shoulder Pads seem way to big and bulky they make it hard to get a snug harness. Not sure why they are REQUIRED for rearfacing (Has anyone contacted graco about why?)<br />X LARGE! I have an Escape and this takes up alot of space.
B0006BAJNG|5|works perfect for on the go bottles
B000GF3M22|5|This is a Christmas gift for a daughter in law.  I had bought her one a long time ago..she has totally worn it out from use, since they live on a beach. She will love it! The way it folds and has a handle to carry it is a definite bonus!
B000FT9J3K|5|We have used this crib through our two youngest children.  Sturdy, holds up and the toddler bed is nice as well.  After a couple years the paint has chipped on the top bar probably from my kids being rough with it (normal wear and tear)...nothing some paint couldn't fix.  But, it's still great and wouldn't hesitate to buy this one again.
B0082Q6AT4|4|I bought this since we had a lot of visitors after the baby came and i didn't want to leave the room each time I had to feed him or pump. Works like it should. I do think the top opening is a little larger than it needs to be. I would have also preferred it to be a little wider, but overall it does what it should.
B00L9A921S|5|Wonderful deal! I had this shipped to a friend who is expecting in a few weeks. She loved it.<br /><br />This is an excellent item for the price. Its all Burt's Bees, and not some random brand (like many other maternity gift sets on Amazon). Moreover all items are FULL SIZE!
B005P07HS8|5|I am really glad I got these.  I wear a pair everyday.  The disposable pads always made my skin itch and looked bulky and bunched under tight shirts.  The Bamboobies are soft, I don't even feel them and you can't see them through shirts.  I have washed mine a bunch now and they are still like new.
B008745ABK|3|These are cute, and have been washed multiple times already. They are just tiny. It's not as though they wouldn't hold a lot, but it has to be a certain shape, and it's just not ideal for us.
B00MI8JOU4|4|Bought this for my newborn niece Kennedy. It arrived quickly for a personalized gift. It's so colorful and cute a great keepsake. I do think $30  is a little much though
B003G2YUUA|5|Loved it!! The sound is super clear and the image is bigger than what I expected!  Great price for a great toy!
B0028IDXDS|5|I love this binky!  Since it is attached to a monkey, I never lose it.  The monkey allowed me to &#34;prop&#34; it up so it stayed in my sons mouth and it's heavy enough that he didn't spit it out for fun, but could remove it if he wanted to.  I have washed it a couple of times by throwing it in the washing machine and it was basically dry when I took it out.  My son chewed through the first binky after several months, so I bought a second one.  After he chewed through that one I went to the store and bought the same brand of binkies, but instead of the newborn ones I got the 9+ mo (i think) and removed the old ones and sewed in the new ones.  Now I have backups and since he is done teething, he hasn't chewed through any more.
B00CEKECJE|2|I only had the stroller for 4months and it closes while I am pushing my baby it's unsafe and I been trying to contact the company for help and I haven't heard anything back yet I payed to much money for these problems to be happening
B000BXJZDY|5|This was a miracle seat recommended from a friend. If you've got two kids to bathe and like the save time this seat is perfect once the infant is around 2 months. Even if you've only got one it is so much better that those fancy whale/duck tubs! Perfectly designed, baby loved to splash his legs and relax in the warm tub. I stopped using it after he wanted to sit up in the bath but it was well worth it for the few months that it was in use!
B000GJIE3K|5|Expensive, but worth every penny.  These bibs comfortably wrap around the back and velcro on the side. They wipe-off easily and last forever!  Prints are also bright and cheerful!  LOVE THEM!
B00CG3CD04|5|I bought this to match my daughter's sheets. It is sooo soft and generously sized.
B00EFR01AS|1|While cute in appearance, these burp cloths are so thin! They are great for protecting your clothing and can only be used once before they need to be washed again.
B0011ECP9S|5|It works and makes my life more efficient.
B000HZI1R2|5|This pillow worked well for positioning my baby while breast feeding.  I found it especially useful because I had a c-section and changing my position was painful.  Now that my little one has some head control and I have recovered from surgery, I am using it primarily for night feedings.  The fit is comfortable for me and I like the soft fabric.  Still looks perfect after laundering.
B00LVMSU0S|5|I love it!  Easy to set up and take down.  Nice and sturdy.
B0000DBHHR|5|I purchased the First Years Everywhere gate from Amazon.com after much research both online and locally and overall I am pleased with it. Installation was a bit challenging, not because of the product but due to the location I needed to install it and the obstacles I had to deal with. I have had it installed for about 3 months now with heavy usage and it is doing exactly what it needs to do very well (protecting our little ones from the stairs) and is very easy to open/close for even our 10yr old. I would definitely recommend this gate for those wanting something safe and secure and peace of mind!
B002VBXY40|4|I bought this for my four month old.  She is too small to use it as a walker, but she loves batting at the toys.  She hates the seat.  There is not any cushioning within the seat and there are a few areas where the plastic digs into her back.  I have to put a blanket around her just to protect her from the bulging plastic.<br />UPDATE:  So, my daughter is seven months now.  She still loves this saucer, but I ended up buying some batting to give her a little more cushion.  She walks around just fine, but the rubber \\"feet\\" that keep the saucer steady come off very easily when we move the saucer and we have to be sure to put them back on before we put her in or else she wont be able to walk around as easily.
B003LQQNH4|5|Great toy
B00HWFKGBE|2|I read the reviews about this product and seller before ordering. I did see that one customer ordered in the color blue and received in pink... I thought it was an honest mistake, it shouldn't happen again. Well... guess what? It happened to me. I clearly ordered in blue and received all 5 bibs in pink. It's okay, we can survive with pink bibs at feeding time but I would prefer to received what I ordered and paid for. The quality so far is okay, it fits just right for him (he is 28 inches tall and 18 lbs, almost 6 months) and you clean the food dropped on the bib right off... I have hand washing them at the sink and they are holding up okay, I have been using it for about a week. Right after I received it on the mail, I found the plastic bibs at Walmart. Of course, cheaper than what I paid here.
B00BLRFMS6|5|My son with autism loves textures and manipulatives.  It can be hard to find ones that are durable enough without being too hard, but this one is just perfect.  It's a great fidget and helps keep his hands busy and relaxed.  I'll be buying more but wish they were a little cheaper since it's so easy to lose things on the bus, at vocational, out in the car, etc.  This is a great product!!
B004RCSG80|5|Our grandson has so much fun with these.  He started holding and playing with these at 3 months old.  Highly recommend these.  Helps teach them how to hold things and also makes a lot of noise which he loves.....
B00KFKE5OM|4|super easy to use. the frozen food pops right out and defrosts easily in the container as well. my daughter loves them!
B001V9KPBI|1|Item did not work for my child
B000TSON4M|5|Thank you
B002L7UDT8|5|Love this product! Oh so soft and warm, and lets our baby sleep safely!
B006JW9O6Y|5|Bag and car seat made a international trip with no problem. Would purchase again if needed. Bag keeps seat clean and easier to carry. Worth the extra $$.
B00K1ZB0X0|5|I'm really glad I bought this. Not too long after I installed this, my son started moving all over his crib! Very stylish and good cushion.
B005J5RWT8|5|I ordered this in white and it is a bright white not an ivory as the first picture seems. I am so glad I found this sturdy crib for such a good price. I previously had a much more expensive one on my registry that I saw in store and this one is just as good if not better.<br /><br />It was easy to set up although I did have a total of three people putting it together. I also listened to a previous reviewer who said not to tighten the crib walls until you put the mattress rack in. Also, we took off our rings while assembling to prevent any nicks or scratches.<br /><br />It looks beautiful in white and I can't get over how great the price is when I almost spent 4 times as much. The screw holes do show but I am either going to paint them or purchase covers.
B00003TL7P|5|My son is a year old, and I have used the Diaper Champ from the first day home from the hospital.  It is so easy to use, and the smell from even the stinkiest of diapers (and my son makes some stinkers!) goes into the champ and stays there.   <br />It is very easy to clean, and as long as you wipe it off if any poopy gets onto it, there is no smell whatsoever. <br />Like I said, I've been using it for a year, and it has never left an odor in my son's room.  It's a cinch to change the bags.  A friend of mine even switched from the Diaper Genie to the Diaper Champ after having dinner at our house.  <br />If you're like me, busy with no time to mess around with messes, I highly recommend this product!
B00A2HUH72|5|Our car was totaled and the insurance company allowed us to buy replacement car seats. I decided to shop for the best. This is it!<br /><br />This carseat is truly exceptional.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-the straps are extremely easy to use. they glide comfortably and quickly. they tighten with gentle pulling. my old carseat required extremely hard pulling to tighten.<br />-the HUGS chest pads are great! they are designed to help keep the child safe in the event of an accident, but they have an additional benefit - the chest clip is so easy to move! I can quickly slide the clip to the safest position, in line with my daughter's armpits. my husband and grandparents are famous for leaving the chest clip down by my daughter's belly button. not with this carseat! you can easily put that clip exactly where it needs to be.<br />-peace of mind! there are small stitches on straps on the back of the carseat. if these small stitches break, it signals that the carseat has been in an accident and is no longer safe to use. I love this!<br />-SO easy to adjust the height of the shoulder straps. this carseat is easier to use than any other that I have tried (& we have now gone through 5 different carseats with our 2 daughters)<br />-company reputation! ask 5 moms what carseat they would trust the most, & most would agree that Britax makes the safest carseats for the most reasonable price.<br /><br />cons:<br />-this carseat is a beast! it's so heavy! we had to travel on an airplane with this carseat. wowza! it's heavy!<br />-rear facing carseats never seem to anchor into the car very well. I trust the safety of this carseat but I do not like that the back of this carseat simply hangs over the front of the seat and the back tether strap simply hangs down. I wish there was a way to anchor the back of rear-facing carseats.<br /><br />buy this carseat! if you only go by company reputation alone, you will be making a great decision!

B0082AUYTC|2|The only good thing about this pail is the way it looks. It does not hold the smell in at all. Every time the lid is opened, the entire room fills with the smell of dirty diapers. Also, you have to be very careful removing the bags, or they will tear on the lid. Definitely not worth the money.
B00IBZ8ADK|1|The leak really bad.
B0058U125O|5|Very cute - nice quality frame, well packaged. Even though this is intended for children I loved it enough to hang it in our family room. No frame needed, it looked good just the way it was.
B00190G4C8|5|This is a simple pack and play, without some of the bells and whistles that are found on more expensive models, which does what it's supposed to.  I bought 2 of these, one for the grandparent's house, and one to keep upstairs in our room (so that my wife can keep an eye on our daughter while she showers, for example).  We have a [[ASIN:B000MAKVE8 Chicco Lullaby LX Playard]] downstairs in the family room which we bought when our daughter was an infant.  I'll add some points of comparison between the Chicco and the Graco at the end of the review.    If you've used a pack and play before, you'll find setting the Graco Pack 'n Play intuitive and easy; it works just like all of the other pack and plays/play yards--unfold and lock the top rails, push down the center support, put the \\"floor\\" (mattress) in place.  If you haven't, the instructions are straightforward and easy.    The Gracos all seem to be highly rated by Consumer Reports (although they do not rate this particular model) and they all appear to be safe (no extraneous straps, no large holes/slots for limbs or heads to be caught in, etc.).  This model does come with the bassinet attachment (which \\"raises\\" the mattress off of the bottom of the play yard--useful for napping infants), but the bassinet should no longer be used once the child can self support (sits on their own).    The Chicco Lullaby LX comes with the bassinet and changing table attachments (along with a few electonic \\"baby soothing\\" goodies) so it adds to the complexity of the setup.  It also more than twice as expensive (almost 3 times as much!).  It is, however the top rated play yard by Consumer Reports.  If you need the extras, by all means go for the [[ASIN:B000MAKVE8 Chicco Lullaby LX Playard]].  Otherwise, the Graco Pack 'n Play makes for a wonderful primary play yard and also does well as a secondary play yard (which is what we're using it for).
B000O7UL1W|1|Blue Way lighter than pictured. Way lighter. Almost dirty white.
B004K38FNM|5|It was just what I was looking for. It fit perfect in my baby trend pack and play. I love using it at the park.
B00A2U86BI|5|Great item.
B000056JA2|4|After going through two of the tents that came with our playard, I finally pulled this one (both items were registry gifts) out of the closet and put it together.<br />Negatives:<br />- Did not fit over the bassinet insert for the playard since the tent snaps on all the way around. However, I view this as a problem with the playard design, not the tent!<br />- Mesh has torn slightly after more than two months of use -- easily repaired with needle and thread.<br />- Only zips open on one side.<br />- Clips for the sides are stiff, which means they can cause minor finger pinches to adults during assembly.<br />Positives:<br />- Snaps all the way around sturdily so cats can't crawl up underneath the edges and into the playard when baby is in there.<br />- Sturdy pole construction, much thicker than other tents, stands up to the weight of two LARGE cats.<br />- Fairly easy to assemble -- it took me about a half hour. A trick to getting the bowed poles into the sleeves: set one end of the already threaded pole against the floor and push down to bend it so that it's easier to slip the other end into the sleeve.<br />- Easy to wash -- can just wipe it down with a baby wipe or disassemble and toss into the wash.<br />- Converts to a cabana so you can use it around the house, or in the yard.<br />- My cats have yet to break it or get inside the playard with it up. That's saying a lot, since I have 6 active felines, 3 of whom weigh more than 10lbs. They walk along the edge of the playard all the time and will scramble over the top of it, but the poles are holding up perfectly well without any signs of damage.
B0033QQ73W|4|I was very pleased that this had a pillow and blanket. The pillow is a little tall for comfort for my toddler, but because it's Princess, she doesn't mind. I like the value of this napmat, but I am disappointed with the thickness. It really shouldn't be called a \\"mat\\" since there is only a thin amount of batting. If my daughter weren't using it on a carpetted surface, I don' think she would be very comfortable.
B000246T54|5|We just had our daughter three weeks ago and tried out the audio monitor for Fisher Price. Nothing but static. Then I started researching monitors since we were going to buy a new one anyway. I found this one as an option that is mostly only available online. Target carries online, but had a waiting time of 6 weeks or something ridiculous like that.<br /><br />Anyway, the basic specs on this were what intrigued me. 2.4GHz frequency, and infrared mode for total darkeness viewing. Our baby is pretty fussy, and you never know if she's awake and fussing, or just fussing as she's half asleep. So it was going to be a major plus to be able to see her.<br /><br />It was the 2.4GHz that scared me at first. It's the same frequency as WiFi, and I have a wireless setup at home. We decided to go ahead and buy this. I was very pleasantly surprised. With the monitor sitting right next to my wireless laptop, I can see some noise, but it's only sporadic. So that was not an issue at all. The nighttime viewing is awesome! With the camera kept upto 6 feet away, it can clearly pick out the baby. And now we can see all that she is doing in *total* darkness. Needless to say, the audio monitor works great too!<br /><br />If you are able to afford this, I would consider this a must have.
B00BZAKJ14|5|This is a great swing at a great price, It is overly price at any store. The best deals are here. The quality is wonderful. My little niece loves the swinging. she loves fighting with figures above her head. This swing keep her occupied then it puts her to sleep. It is worth the investment
B00JRYRYS6|4|Great car seat. Clip between let's isn't long enough at all tho.. Only disappointing thing.
B001CJGFT8|5|My grandson is 10 weeks old, and he loves his red doggy.  My daughter took it on a road trip, and William loved to hold it along the way and at the places where they stayed.  It is very soft and cuddly.
B006TJUN4O|5|I first found this Carrier in my search for &#34;The best baby packs 2012&#34; and it was rated as the number 1 overall. And FYI this is the &#34;Daddy&#34; reviewing this product. I found this pack to be amazing not only for me but for my wife and son as well. We use it all the time in place of a stroller. He's been in his pack when we go out since he was a newborn. He is now about 6months and is about 20lbs (he grown to be a very long or &#34;tall&#34; baby). We still have no problems with him in the pack, its safe, comfortable, not too &#34;girly&#34; for the guys to wear and well worth the cash spent. I researched tons of other baby packs comparing safety with pricing and the Cybex 2.Go was the winner in both categories of being affordable and extremely safe for my baby.<br /><br />Just to overview what we have experienced with this pack:<br />1. It last for a long time even with every day use.<br />2. It's easy to clean.<br />3. The straps help ease pressure off your back/shoulders/hips and disperses it evenly.<br />4. Your baby will fit in this pack as a NB and will continue to as he/she grows.<br />5. Both rear and front facing positions work great for baby (my son chews on the bib it comes with and even falls asleep in the pack).<br />6. The Cybex 2.Go is really simple/easy to use by yourself without assistance. (I recommend practicing with a 2nd person first to get use to it, besides its safer that way.)<br />7. Its not too overly padded or bulky, I'd consider it just right.<br /><br />In a nutshell this product is very good and lives up to my very high standards I hold to any product involving my child. If you have any questions about the pack let me know I'd be happy to help, but trust me when I say its worth every penny.
B004044LD4|3|So I don't know anything about it's performance.  My great grandson seems to be sleeping okay, so I guess it's okay.
B00RW1H2WE|4|I bought this as a gift for my friends baby and he seems to like it.
B00HAZUJLI|5|This is the second Graco crib I have purchased and absolutely love it! Bought it because I love the three different levels for growing baby. Graco is a quality brand! Would recommend to everyone!
B003KN27FA|4|It's a bit larger than I anticipated, but it went into my Britax B-Agile very easily and keeps my little guy warm. Well worth the money since we'll be able to use it for a couple of winters. The navy is much bluer in person than on my computer screen and the interior is very fuzzy. I love it!
B000G1YW98|5|love that its 30&#34; high so also my pets cant jump over it vs. the 24&#34; gate we used to have. sturdy product. well worth it and way cheaper than buying in the store!
B00IQZD63E|5|Amazing product! I never go anywhere with out it!
B001LQLLNC|5|Needed this for my sons high hair since his belt broke he holds him in but he can still wiggle out so just slows him down a bit
B003A9LO0S|5|A good price for wool soakers.  These are pretty light weight - double layered knit rather than a heavier more felted type of knit.  A good fit around the legs and pretty good protection.
B0050GD2E0|3|This cup holder serves its purpose just fine and I'm glad we bought it because we use it all the time, but if you forget it's on there and try to close the stroller without removing it first it will inevitably pop off and roll under the car. Yeah, that's somewhat annoying.
B003X3R6TO|5|These are the best cloth wipes. They're  soft and absorbent and can be used for many things. They have held up well in the wash..I put them in a mesh delicates bag.
B00640G4FU|4|We have a maxi cosi car seat and we leave in WI. I am pleased with how warm this car seat cover is, and it fits well. The &#34;window&#34; is quite a bit higher than what we need it to be for now, but our little one is only one week old so she will grown into it. It is easy to put on and take off and inside blanket keeps her nice and snug. The only complaint is a lack of fun colors! Grey and Black is all they have!? Really?
B007A2ZP6K|5|These door knob covers stop my 2-year-old from opening her door. We adults hate them too, but must grudgingly acknowledge that they do exactly what they are supposed to. Unlike some door knob covers that just require enough pressure to turn the knob, these require you to turn the knob with just the tips of your thumb and middle finger (or maybe your index finger). That is hard enough for an adult to do, and probably impossible for a toddler. Recommended.
B00853OP5K|5|Very usefull
B007S1T4Q0|4|I had a c-section with my daughter and this was great because I could bathe her in the sink standing up, but also I didn't have to hold her the whole time. Which is great because you can't get down next to a tub right after a c-section, and holding or supporting any kind of weight is really painful. I'd recommend for c-section mommies
B000I2Q0F4|5|My 4 month old loves this. It's big, bright, and soft and she loves grabbing on to the wings and giving it &#34;hugs&#34;.
B00227HMSW|5|My one year old loves her zebra. It was hard for her to get on and off the first few days, but once she figured it out, she loved it. She can finally reach the floor, she loves spinning, jumping up and down, then getting off and walking around it.
B004HKK5TK|1|Do not purchase this mattress.  It is way too soft and provides no support.  My daughter couldn't even sit up on it and would fall to her side.  It was like watching her trying to sit up right on a water bed.  It would also depress, than poof back up (like an air mattress).
B00006S3RX|5|My in-laws bought this for my son, and he just loves it.  When we put him in the ones at the store, he seemed to like this one much better than the others, which is great because this is the only one that has a carrying handle and folds up a little bit.  It is still pretty large with all the toys hanging on it, but if you're traveling anywhere with a baby, you know that any space you can gain really helps.  My son plays in this all the time.  He likes to spin the ball and stare at himself in the mirror.
B00171H784|5|My mother got me 2 packs of these burp cloths at Buy Buy Baby when my daughter was born almost 6 months ago and they have been wonderful. We use them everyday and they have saved many an outfit from ruin when the spit-up comes. They are large enough to cover your shoulder well but not huge like a cloth diaper. (they measure 14.5 x 20.5) I like to fold them in half and that way when she spits up on one side I can turn it around and still use the cloth...makes for less laundry. I recently went back to Buy Buy Baby to pick up another pack to have (figured having 18 would be better than the 12 I had) and they were out of them! Seems the stock comes in and out. Well I panicked...no other brand of burp cloth I could find had the size, thickness, and quality of these. I am so happy to see them on Amazon and absolutely recommend them to others. (Note: if you can find these at a Buy Buy Baby near you...they sell for a little less at $9.99).
B001MS83OE|3|It is a fine changing pad but it's not as pictured. It's quite contoured and that's not what we wanted. We were hoping to use this as a mini mattress if you will.. so the baby can lay down on it for say 30 minutes or something. So we wanted something nice and flat.. but this was not it. I am sure it works fine as a regular changing pad.
B008Z76L2Q|4|Is not the original but works just as well for less of the price for an original one, well recommend
B009AXSR62|5|We have used the Aden + Anais blankets with all of our kids and swear by them.  We have tried both the single layer and double layered, and prefer the thicker ones.  Although they seem to be high in price they are a quality item, and again have been used with multiple kids with little to no wear.  Very happy with these blankets and are worth the price.
B001ECDN0W|1|Really pretty chain, non-toxic - wanted to love it. Despite reading previous reviews I purchased it and now wish I hadn't. I took it out of the box and cleaned it with soap and water and after 2secs the top bead started to split. It seems to go back together a little bit every time it dries but obviously my baby chews on it so it is only a matter of time until the bead splits in half. Serious choking hazard, so disappointed.
B004IEBSSW|4|I love this bundle and would give it 5 stars but sadly it doesn't fit on the front of a shopping cart the way I would like it to. I'm used to carseats having a leveled appearance where your child is in a reclined position; There are only two options aside from placing the seat inside the acutal buggy; your child can either be inverted or you can angle them straight up by up but the red hook in the back will be too far forward to latch onto the cart itself.
B003LQVZOK|4|Thought it will be better. But my cousin loved it so it was worth it. Acceptable size. Great material.
B000069670|5|This video says it all!    I was reluctant to spend $30 on a baby mirror, but I caved when I saw the Sassy Me in the Mirror because it looked like fun for baby and versatile to place almost anywhere. Well, I'm glad I got this because my little guy just loves it!! Since Peanut cannot yet sit or even roll over, hanging it under a laptop table worked perfectly. He especially loves to chew and pull on the purple ring, as he could bring it to his mouth without him gagging and he never loses it. Who needs all those lights, sounds and electronic doo-dads. Leave it to baby to create the \\"eee's\\", \\"ahhh's\\", clicks and thumps when playing with the Me in the Mirror!
B005J5RWT8|5|The crib is sturdy, good quality, easy to assemble, and looks nice. I recommend this crib to anyone with a new born or toddler.
B006QRFD4Y|5|Simple, perfect, contains smell & wetness.
B00295MQLU|5|Got the black one. It offers excellent support for pumping; comfortable but still provides pressure for good pumping while reading, checking emails, etc. Also like the adjustable size. If you're pumping with a machine and going back to work/at work, you need this bra.
B006UO40XI|5|These are so cute and perfect for a little jungle theme. Definitely came at a great price and everyone loved them at the shower! Thought they were adorable and would use them again if I could :)
B0011ECP9S|2|It works, but it's very weak. I have to turn the power up almost all the way to get the same effect as having it on low plugged into an outlet.
B00AHVR6TA|4|I am happy with the chair. It is easy to move around. My only bad comment is that the front bar on the ground does not allow me to bring my own chair closer to him to feed him.<br />I love the fcat that it folds. It is easy to put away in a corner till u use it again. I like how easy it is to clean and I even use it for him to watch TV (for 15 min) when he eats his cookie.
B000XT30G4|5|worth the money great product
B007BH9UI8|5|Got this for my newborn daughter. She isn't really old enough to know that they are a toy, or to even hold them in her hand, but I'm sure once she is 35 or 36 years old she will have it figured out.
B00JD8HP5I|5|This set worked great for us. We can brush his teeth with the large one and then he can do it (at least try) himself with the little one. I would buy again .
B000K8RRU8|2|Not very good at blocking out sun. If you want it for looks that's about the only benefit. With a clean window and all it always seemed to come off.
B002C30S96|5|IT IS GOOD !
B00AJSIVWW|4|the booster was put together in a matter of minutes and seems to be sturdy.  I especially like the design of the cupholders with all of the weird shaped kids cups that we have.
B001GZJU4K|5|I will give 10 stars if I could. !!! I will recommend to any one BABYBJORN bouncer my little girl bounc her self always to sleep !! Just great !!
B0036SGC96|5|We went to Disneyland recently and we borrowed a friends buggyguard hook. It works great when you are shopping in the park and are not ablle to get back to your hotel room. We were able to put about 10 bags on the hook without a problem. I had to buy us our own for our next trip.
B001F50FFE|5|It's always fun to write a review on those products that not only worked out great but also were a smashing value, to boot.  This, along with the 8 oz version that we also used, is one of those products.<br /><br />When I told my wife how much I loved these bottles, she just shook her head as if to say 'The poor man has gone mental.'  Sure, I may spend more time with my power tools than baby bottles, but I quickly grew fond of feeding my baby daughter and I always appreciate a super product at a great value.  Also, I figure there ought to be some positive side to my initial, terrifying, experience to shopping for feeding supplies.  It was my mission, you see, to get the bottles and accessories necessary for feeding baby when mommy went back to work.  (baby was breastfed and went to the bottle for pumped milk...)  No problem, I thought.  Go to the store, grab some bottles and be home in 20 minutes, I thought.  Whoa.  First time parents, you know what I am talking about:  go into one of those giant baby supply stores and behold the section labeled 'feeding' and there it is - a wall 8 feet high by  40 feet long.  (seemed like 100 feet long at the time)  Shelves and shelves and shelves of JUST bottles, and we're not even talking about nipples.  My wife thought I had instead gone to a bar when I finally got home 4 hours later, exhausted and overwhelmed.  With no bottles.  OK, so the review...<br /><br />We wanted bottles with no BPA, which was beginning to make big news a few years ago, so we explored non-BPA options.  There were plastic ones, but not all of them indicated on the bottle exactly what type of plastic they were.  (you know, PETE, HDPE, LDPE, etc. with those little triangles on the bottom)  That made me unsure of plastic.  Then we considered glass.  Would they break?  Sure, if they were dropped far enough on a hard surface, but we decided we'd be careful.  So, these glass bottles have no BPA.  Another nice benefit is that they also have no printing, so we don't have to worry about what chemicals or heavy metals might also be in the printing.  And, another nice thing about not having any printing is that the printing doesn't wear off after hundreds of feedings and cleanings.  These bottles have their gradations formed right into the glass, so they'll wear out when the bottle wears out.  Which is never.<br /><br />They are colorless.  We like that also.  You can see what's in the bottle, and you can also tell when they are clean.  I mean, there's nothing so clean looking as clear glass with no water spots, right?  We've seen other plastic bottles that were colored or turned cloudy over time, and I don't like not seeing exactly what my baby is drinking.<br /><br />They are durable.  Unless you clean them with steel wool, these bottles won't scratch.  Can't say that about plastic.  They also won't melt, either, when you boil them to sterilize.  BPA-free plastic may be great when it is cold, but I wondered what chemicals they may be releasing at over 212 degrees.  Any glass is breakable, but our daughter didn't break a single one in almost two years.  And she tried.  I found them to be as sturdy, when using and cleaning them, as our drinking glasses.  No parent wants their child to be showered with broken glass, but we came to the conclusion that there was no more to fear from this happening with baby's bottles than with any other glass she is around. (car windows, house windows, drinking glasses, dishes, etc.)  When baby turned to toddler, however, the deal's off, as she likes nothing better than to hurl everything she can hold.  Nowadays it's nothing but titanium plates and bowls for her...<br /><br />Value.  This one's a biggie.  Nothing's too good for my daughter, a sentiment shared by every other parent on earth, I reckon.  But these are reasonable.  You've seen other glass bottles, the ones that ape the 'no BPA' angle, the ones that cost nearly TEN bucks for a measly TWO bottles?  Yikes!  I looked at them, and they'refine bottles, but we're talking value here and these Evenflo bottles win that argument, for me.  Besides, I recall that these bottles came not only with a ring and nipple, but also a top cap, and a seal that goes under the ring so you can shake up formula without spewing it all over the place through the nipple.  (ask me how I know)<br /><br />Other nice things:  These come in common-sense sizes, 4 and 8 ounces.  Also, they happen to fit perfectly Medela breast pump valves - for those of you so inclined - so you can pump directly into the bottle and then pop it in the fridge.  Cool!  (yeah, my wife just loves it when I wax enthusiastic about all this)  Most importantly of all, they worked great for our daughter.  No gas, no fussiness, no issues at all with the nipples, which do vent.  (there's a shallow groove on the base of the nipples that allows air into the bottle if you don't over-tighten the ring)<br /><br />Are these bottles perfect?  Not universally, I'm sure, but they were perfect for us and we'll be using them for our next little one.  One nice thing is that you can always change nipples to another brand if baby likes those best or to a different flow rate if necessary.  (they come with different flow rates??  Who knew?!)ere and these Evenflo bottles win that argument, for me.

B003X26IUI|3|This is a v good product, but it is meant for babies 6-9 months only. It has lovely bright colors and dries v quickly. I am happy with the product but just a heads-up that the neck will become tight once the baby crosses 9 months.
B00CMNMCWW|4|This is a great bag - I love that you can adjust the compartments inside to meet your needs.  An insulated compartment to keep a cold or warm bottle would be helpful - you can buy these seperate and just stick in the bag, but would still be a helpful component to any diaper bag.<br />If you insert the velcro compartment pieces on each side of the bag, the bag is not quite wide enough to accomodate them side by side.  Either a wider base on the bag on more narrow inserts might be the solution to this.  They still work fine, but the inserts on one side or the other have to arch slightly to adjust to the width of the bag. This is my only reason for not giving 5 stars, but is not a deal breaker - it is still a great bag.
B0000DEW8N|5|I chose this product because of the mobility and multi-usage. my son is now 8 (bought this when he was about 6 months old) and he can still use it as a booster when we visit grandparents as their chairs are so low for him.
B000TFGUC8|4|My little guy has been using this for 2 months now (he's 4 months now) and he really enjoys it. He constantly kicks at the toy bar, which changes the music (I don't know if he realizes that yet though). I like the options for the music and all the loops to put toys on. You can change it up as often as you like, it's really easy. I can usually get 10-20 minutes of time for myself while he's under this gym. My only complaint is that the fabric is so soft and silky that it doesn't work well for tummy time. He just slides around on it. The same goes for the stuffed whale toy it comes with it. It's supposed to be used as a prop pillow but it's slippery and a weird shape to be used for this.
B00KSABSY4|5|Great stroller fan! Foam fan is great because it doesn't hurt little curious fingers!
B00CPC2A2M|5|These were perfect for our preemie twinnies.
B002AQRNPC|5|These are each perfect and beautiful. They got here fast and in perfect condition, I would definetly buy from this company again!!
B00IBZ8ADK|5|these fit perfect! I have a medela pump and avent bottles!
B00208S304|2|Way too big and leaves space in between the two at the corner so my kids still chewed the railing I even tried tiring the two together no help
B002SG775U|3|just as seller advertised, this item was new and when I received it I loved it. But it didn't last for a few months of use before the inner lining started to come apart. I was disappointed and had to buy a new one.
B007HZ9V4C|3|My son has used the Fisher-Price Rainforest Waterfall Peek-a-Boo Soother for 2 years. We got this for our daughter when she was 4 months old and ready to transition to her crib.The music and sounds that it plays are nice, but it turned out to be a little too stimulating and not very soothing. I would attribute this to the lights that turn on and off - they are just a bit too bright. The lights on the Waterfall Soother are much more subtle and calming. The Moonbeam Soother, in comparison, also has a louder motor. The buttons on the front are too high for an infant who is not able to get to a sitting position by herself yet. Our 2.5 year old son was interested in this one so we ended up switching them.The on/off button on the Waterfall Soother is on the lower right so our now 6-month-old is able to turn it on by herself. She still wouldn't be able to do that with the Moonbeam Soother. In retrospect, I definitely would've purchased another Waterfall Soother, but luckily my son has been okay with the trade.
B004C43JIU|5|good deal
B0012UZX4A|4|This is cute.  The foot stamp is difficult to use but at least the baby stays clean.  Overall nice amount of pages.
B006ZIST04|5|Good quality and easy to install.
B0056QLVY2|5|I assumed this item would have been deliverd assembled because Amazon did not specify one way or another and I wasn't given the option to choose. This item was delivered in what seemed to be a thousand pieces. I contacted the company and they referred me back to Amazon. I was not able to reach anyone to resolve my problem at Amazon.  Thanks to my brilliant husband he put the dresser together and made my pregnant daughter very happy.  I have no problems with the furniture just the lack of information on how it would be delivered.
B003Y3BH2U|5|These little things are great! We put them on granddaughter Eliza's stroller so her toys and pacifier don't land in the road. They are easy to use and they work perfectly.
B005TJ2XQQ|5|My daughter loves the MAM pacifiers.  I got here these because she likes to chew on the sides.  She drools a TON and other than the MAM Air ones, these are the best ones for not making the drool worse.
B0012ADSN8|4|I love this toilet seat.  My son is little for a 3 year old but feels comfortable sitting on this seat. My 5 year old prefers to use it too.  It is easy to flip, cannot be slammed (bonus) and cleans easily.
B0030UUBMO|5|This is just perfect to update our portable cribs, which came with a very thin foam mattress. Our little grandson slept soundly, which is as good as it gets!
B00BWIPBC6|1|This may work for an infant but is NOT built strong enough to use with a toddler. My 18 month old daughter was getting out of bed to sleep with mom every night. Got this expensive tent and thought the problem was solved. My daughter liked going to bed in &#34;the tent&#34; and would climb in and pull the door flap down to let us know she was ready for a nap or bed.  Well it lasted just 2 months before the mesh/screen door flap tore off the top of the tent.  That was my concern the moment I took it out of the box - that the mesh sides and door was too flimsy to last. Unfortunately I was right.  And Amazon wont let em return it - so I am out $70 bucks.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.  This tent is a good idea -that is poorly constructed and overpriced!
B00AHVR4LA|5|FAST SHIPPING, NICE PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE
B00CI4IUSK|5|my son loves it!
B00HPQTJ18|3|Made cheap
B002Q0Y8QO|5|My first concern before buying this was how sturdy the material would be. We took it home (bought it from BabyRUs) tried it out and it turned out pretty good. The strap was easy to adjust, wasn't uncomfortable at all. My daughter smiled while when we put her in it and that was all the approval I needed.
B004J4VY44|4|Great for new parents trying to manage all the bottles and nipples...steams quickly and is easy to clean, assemble, etc.
B00AB795DA|5|Thank you, lifesaver
B00ISS2JPK|2|My daughter was miserable in this car seat on the airplane.  It has almost a 90 degree angle for the seat back and she could not fall asleep without her head falling forward and waking her up.  Never using it again.
B008KW8JTE|4|Bought this for my 15 month old for his room. He loves to sit on it and pretend to read his book. It seems pretty sturdy since he tries to climb on it and it won't topple over. It is on the small side so might not be great for older kids
B00BH35O4G|3|I found it wore easily.  You can only put a small amount of laundry in.
B009YSYD20|5|Quite good comparing with the manual one. My wife could be much more easier to make it, especially in the night.
B001OC5UMQ|4|Great sturdy gates but the entrance is a bit narrow and they can be hard to put into smaller door openings. I now have two and really like them.
B002JP7USY|4|Great, well-made backpack.  Perfect size for grandson who's almost 2 yrs old.  Style, zipper pulls, pockets, etc. were actually much nicer than I had expected, for the price!
B003E6OBMA|5|Great swaddler for our 4mo old baby.<br />I don't think we'd be able to get through the night these first few months without this.<br />He loves it and sleeps tight! pun intended.
B00AJSJCC0|5|I originally purchased this saucer because it was cheaper than the rest I considered. Because of the seemingly few toys, I was afraid that my son would get bored. We put him in it the first time at 5 months, and a month and a half later he LOVES it!!! He'll jump non-stop for at least five minutes (and he really enjoys the bounce he gets from it) and the rest of the time he'll just grab the attached toys, bend them to him and just chew on them or play them. I also love playing with the clear aquarium roll and will just roll it over and over, lol! At 6 months my son is now using this on the 2nd height, and pretty soon we'll have to raise it to the highest height level. I'm not sure until when he'll be able to use it, but for now he just loves to jump and play in his Exersaucer.
B002SW3F0A|5|My 18-month old wears these for fireworks and other loud activities.
B003L9JRH4|5|These diapers work well and are a great deal.  They are easy to use and I prefer them to the Thirsties brand for a few reasons.  One is that they have the pocket so the insert goes in easy and stays there, as well as easy to remove.  The other is that on the Thirsties brand, the adjustable snaps made imprints on my baby's legs.  I don't think it hurt, but I didn't like it.    You have to be careful not to put these in the dryer, but I dry in inserts that way and hang the diapers on the towel bar in the bathroom, over the heat/air vent and that way they dry pretty quickly (about 1/2 a day).    I also love the feeling I get when using these diapers... they are comfortable for my baby and I don't feel like I'm always throwing our money away.
B00V2N7FXO|5|Love, Love, Love this diaper bag. Great gender neutral plaid that my husband will carry without a fight. Love that I don't have to put baby on nasty chairs because backpack storage doubles as a portable kid restraint. Very cool!
B004LVP4BY|5|Very cute. A little big for my 21month old daughter cos she's skinny but it was still beautiful.
B0006HBS1M|5|I get far more milk out when I use this as opposed to an electric pump (playtex). It also takes no time at all! I love this pump. Definitely recommend if you are going to be pumping once a day or just occasionally.
B002NUXHK0|5|The Easy Expression Bustier has changed the way I look at pumping!  Having the ability to carry on working, talking on the phone, and using the computer (while pumping) has been amazing! A friend recommended this product and I'm so glad that I purchased one for myself.  It's wonderful - especially when pumping at work!
B00SK4UVDY|5|Perfect for a baby Easter basket!  Soft and safe!!
B00H8WHAMO|5|This fabric was easy to sew with with a rougher fabric side and the waterproof side on the opposite. Works great and shipping was fast and effective.
B00N1G8A0W|5|Awesome product. I wish I bought it much earlier. Didn't get to use it much.
B000HK6BCE|1|I don't even think this deserves 1 star! It wasn't easy to get together. It moved constantly under the mattress and when it was under the mattress... it raised it up the really high in the middle...it was like a huge lump in the middle...I'm sure it would eventually warp the matress. We took it right off and went out and bought a different brand and it works soooooooooo much better.
B00A65YMA8|5|does the job! my baby boy can grab the string, find the binky on the end and put it in his own mouth! really cute and good price!  I am ordered more for a baby shower gift!
B00O2VQZ8O|5|Good
B000FFL58Q|2|giraffe does not attach to mat and with one swift kick will come tumbling down on baby.  also baby would have to have freakishly long arms in order to spin butterflies.  will be returning
B00421BLV0|5|This is the best swaddler on the market and by FAR the easiest to use! All you do is put them in and zip them up.  I wish I had found these for my first daughter.  I like that your baby isn't in a \\"straight jacket\\" like most swaddlers.  The material is snug to make the babies feel secure but at the same time they aren't in a restraint.  I have bought this for every person I know having a baby since I found them. Words cannot express how wonderful this swaddler is!
B00GS1GXMY|5|I am so happy with this high chair! It folds up so easily...goes in the car with us so our grandson can visit friends and family.  Perfect for us and we are all thrilled with it including my daughter who is very fussy about safety etc.
B00FNJ7FRO|3|My rating is only because this exact same rocking sleeper is only $69 at Toys R Us (currently with free shipping) and Walmart has it for $49 (it was out of stock last time I checked)!  I'm used to Amazon having great pricing, but not in this case.<br /><br />The sleeper itself is wonderful (although you will need to buy 3AA batteries for the projector and a C battery for the vibration), but it's a lot more wonderful for $10 or $20 less.  Save your money and pick this up from Walmart (if you can wait for them to restock it) or Toys R Us (if you need it right away).
B00D4XZO2E|5|Purchased for an upcoming trip. I am 5'1 and it feels a little tall for me but great stroller.
B004L2JJ6O|5|We have traveled overseas a number of times and this seat packs nicely into the suitcase.  I have used it while traveling when my son was 10 months, 18 months, and 2.5 years.  At almost three years old he uses it regularly at home as we have another child who needs the highchair now.  He is not a very large boy though.  It is also very easy to wipe clean.<br /><br />The only problem I found is that it is possible for the kids to push their feet against some tables and nearly push their chair over.  I know lots of people with this seat and I don't think that has actually caused any real problems though.  I would still highly recommend it!
B00CXVNOXO|5|Fits perfect and looks great!
B00B52801S|5|Finally they dropped the price!!! I had the Minky Hero Cloth Diapers instead because they were cheaper and now they dropped the price! 5 stars!!!
B003P5NOZA|2|These are OK. They're too large for what they're designated to hold and the lids aren't held on by anything, so every time they get knocked off a shelf the lid and contents go flying. There are better ways to get the same effect.
B00829U5MO|5|The best sleep solution for new babies. The 100% cotton material is a must have for new babies and their sensitive skin. The wrapping arms makes swaddling a breeze even in the middle of the night. And I don't know about other babies but my baby always broke out of swaddles. He slept so soundly in this, I swear by them and buy them for all of my friends that are having new babies.
B00005V9ND|5|The Diaper Dekor Refills are the easiest and most economical system of refills I have come across for Diaper Disposal.  It takes seconds to refill the bags and they hold an amazing amount of dirty diapers.  I LOVE my Diaper Dekor and the refill system I purchased shortly after my daughters birth 17 months ago. Unlike other diaper disposal systems the Diaper Dekor and Diaper Dekor Refills are EASY to use and there is never any odor.
B000056JHN|4|I bought the one headset version, knowing full well I might never actually get to hear a heartbeat (no one I talked to who had used it had had much luck).  <br /> <br />However, at 23 weeks 2 days, last night, about my 3rd or 4th time using it, we were able to hear a definite heartbeat. Before that, we were able to hear kicks, which is totally worth the $20 in my opinion so that my husband can hear what I feel. I'm really glad I bought this! I tuck it right into the wasteband of my maternity pants once I find a good spot and sit back and read.
B00MRZIFD0|2|My 10 month old hasn't gotten the concept of drinking out of other sippy cups but can drink from a regular cup and make a mess. I thought this was perfect. People said it didn't leak, but what they failed to mention was that if your child drops it, liquid will fly everywhere. My son likes them but I feel like I can only put water in them. Maybe when he stops throwing things it will be better.
B0025Y6742|5|Nice small food container, nice and small.
B00292BF1K|1|I bought it for my 1 year old twins -- they dont even want to look at it.  the quality is also not good -- just worth $5 at most.
B000087L2U|1|My worst decision was not buying a new car seat.  The second worst decision was buying this one to begin with.  Trying to buy only the best for my son, and knowing that Peg Perego products are highly rated, we opted for this seat.<br />We could never get him comfortable in it. He cried and screamed every time he was in it.  It was painful to take him anywhere.   The straps were impossible to adjust.  He was always hot and he outgrew it before he was 4 months old (and way before the 20 lb, 26 inch limit).  Once we got him into his Britax Roundabout convertible, I was able to go out of the house again.  He actually laughed during the first trip.
B007IUYMUE|2|Cute, but the lion stopped making the clicking noise after about a week of use and the sun flower stopped shortly after. It isn't really bouncy. Also, when trying to put the fabric seat on, the spots where the tabs are supposed to go through weren't even sewn correctly. One was sewn at the top so the tab wouldn't go all the way through and two other ones weren't even close to the tab.
B004KMZHX4|5|The thing I like best about these wipes is that they are safe to go in babies mouth so I can clean baby items without the worry of what kind of chemicals baby might be ingesting. I originally bought them to use on breast pump parts since they are so much more economical that the ones sold specifically for this purpose. They did a great job of removing milk and keeping things clean while on the go. Now that I am finished breast feeding they are a diaper bag staple for cleaning pacis, teethers, and anything else baby might put in her mouth.
B00IISBHXU|5|Love that you can control the camera remotely, perfect to watch both my boys that share a room together.  Only need 1 monitor to watch them both.
B0028IDXDS|4|Our son is breast fed and pacifiers are not something he seemed to enjoy. We purchased this one as it was similar to the one from the hospital only it has the monkey attached. The weight of the monkey helps keep the pacifier in his mouth, he sucks on this pacifier more than any of the other ones of the same type we've tried. The animal attached to it is a good idea since it really does help keep the pacifier in his mouth.
B008D1O8TM|3|These pads are very absorbent and come wrapped in plastic which I like. However, when I had latch issues which made my breasts tender and sensitive these pads really irritated me, they felt rough and itchy. I switched to the Nuk nursing pads which were much more comfortable.
B00BEVF1XU|5|My three-year-old loves this seat and so do we. He was in a Britax Roundabout for over 2 years until he just seemed like he was running out of room. He can climb in and out of the Frontier with ease and looks to be very comfortable. The fabric is great, it seems to me kind of like a raincoat type material and super easy to wipe of with a damp paper towel. We have the seat installed with the Latch system and it's very secure. Love it!
B001R8YYOC|1|Disappointed!  My 10 month old really loved this, but I've had it less than two weeks and one of the natural wooden beads has already splintered and now I have to discard it.  I was expecting it to last longer...
B004Q2Z9TK|5|We got two. They are easy to wash and hang dry. I hang them outside with the diapers. I use them in a 13 gallon trash bin to collect diapers for a day or two. No smell, no problems. The green color is my favorite.
B0097D4ZMU|5|Bought this at a baby retailer for half the price...for under $10, this is such a great score!  Now I can stop using my IPOD dock radio static and use the white noise feature or ocean option as a replacement.  It's awesome that I can use it on the go, too.
B007AKGBU6|5|This is actually 2 products in one.  A &#34;piano&#34; toy and a baby walker ( the toy justifies the higher price for the walker IMO). My daughter has been using this for 3 months now, and it is one of her favorites. She's a tall one so from 5 months old she was able to touch the ground (but not really propel herself) on the lowest setting. She is now 8 months and is using the next to highest setting so we have two or three more months of solid use before she will outgrow it. (Hopefully she is walking by this time!) We DID have to make incisions to increase the leg holes (a common complaint it appears) but after making a cut and reinforcing it, we had no problem getting her in and out of the walker. The piano toy is removable and she enjoys having it in her high-chair while waiting to be fed. It has taken a fair amount of abuse with no signs of stopping. As a parent we appreciate that there is a host of different sounds so we are not subjected to the same tune ad nauseum.
B00NGSIH9O|5|We have absolutely loved our Zeta Zebra! Our daughter immediately took to it and hasn't stopped chomping on it yet. New Little Wonders has also been a delight to work with and I love the care they put into all of their product designs. We can't wait for Zen Zeta to be available!
B00003TL7P|5|This is THE BEST diaper pail we've had.  The Genie was a pain, with all the twisting and the special bags refills.  This locks the odor in the pail, is easy to use one-handed, and a favorite for babysitters and guests.  I've recommended it to many, and all have loved it!  We found it easy to replace the bags, and to put in a dirty diaper.  I don't know why people have had problems with it.  It couldn't be easier!
B005OI8O88|5|At first I didn't want to order these because of the steep price tag! Who really wants to spend $14 for 2 teething rings?! But I bought them anyway as a Christmas gift for my 4 month old daughter. Poor thing has been teething since she was two months old. She ends up chewing on her fingers most of the time because that is what is accessible to her. We opened these up for her (I washed them before wrapping) and instantly she stared at it, reached out and grabbed it, pulled it to her mouth and veraciously attacked it!! Her hand eye coordination isn't the greatest cuz she's only 4 months, but we were working on it tonight with this teether! Over several hours she only dropped it twice! If it did fall out of her hand it usually went around her arm, then when she'd put her arm down she would feel it as it fell over her hand. She'd stare at it for a second then bring it back to her mouth! It's silicone so it squishes easily. She had it contorted into all sorts of shapes because she'd bite it and stretch or squish it all at the same time! She bit with her front &#34;teeth&#34; and back &#34;teeth&#34; so it was small enough to get back there, but it stays wide enough that it's not gonna go down the throat! It is the perfect size to stretch over my wrist to wear as a bracelet so I always have it on hand for her, or just a convenient, hands free place to hold it! I also love that it's made in Racine, WI! Right here in the US! All that being said, I've read some reviews on this about how pieces can break off, but if you just inspect it before each use (like you should any way) that shouldn't be a problem! Also, it is silicone, it attracts hair, but again, inspect it, pull it off and build your child's immunity! For us, this product is definitely worth the price and I would buy it again in a heartbeat!
B004P1IWJQ|5|This is exactly what I needed for my daughter's laundry. I was having a hard time finding a cute, kids hamper that wasn't extremely small. This one is a good size and won't fill up quickly. It pops up nicely and seems sturdy, yet light enough for my daughter to tote around. Great purchase!
B00O20OIMU|1|My one year old was able to push hard enough to bend and dislodge the screw mounting the gate. It allowed the gate to open and she fell down seven stairs before I could reach her (I was at the end of the hall). Thankfully only minor bumps. It was installed as the directions said, and we checked it weekly to ensure it wasn't getting loose from use. This gate is going back. Wouldn't have given it one star, but I had to in order to write my review. Buyer beware.
B000PKVEPU|3|This basket is very beautiful. However, the wood seems to be splintering in some places. I need to really go over in and inspect it thoroughly again but, at this point I'd feel a little nervous putting a child in it. The basket is exactly as pictured and the seller shipped it promptly. I just am not sure if I should have expected some splintering from this type of sleeper or not. I thought that since it was supposed to be for infants that it would meet certain basic guidelines.
B003YLEU1M|5|I've had these bottles for a few weeks now and must say that they are the cutest bottles I've ever seen.  I ordered the boy bottles and the blue & green colors are very nice. My baby is exclusively breastfed and wouldn't take the standard nipple or the Nuk ones. It seemed like he didn't know how to use the bottle and would chew and play with the nipple. I bought these bottles based on all the good reviews and must say the nipples are easier for baby to latch on to.  My little guy still doesn't prefer the bottle, but knew how to suck from this nipple and no longer plays with it.  He doesn't drink more than an ounce or two from the bottle, but thats another issue.  At least he drinks some and with practice and persistence I he is getting used to taking a bottle.  Also, some other reviews commented on leaks, but I haven't yet experienced any.  Bottles are easy to wash and reassemble.
B0039ONN5S|5|these will come in a very small package... so they will be squashed. but fitting them on a microphone will get their shape back. seperatley, it will cost alot more to buy 5 of these.
B00F2MQ294|4|Really like this but wish there was a bar overhead too for baby to reach up at. My soon is 4 months and hasn't been able to grab things yet so the dangling toys are not entertaining him, yet. Other than that, it holds the baby really well and is very sturdy!
B00BH0RKSC|5|I'm a first time mom and my baby is exclusively breastfed. It has been a hassle getting her to take a bottle and a paci. I have to say she immediately latched on this paci. It was awesome, she is 2 months old and has started sucking her hand which is a terrible habit, so we wanted to find a paci. We used Avent and MAM she hated both of them.
B002MGZQUY|4|great gift
B00N3K4HP8|5|Great pillow. Soft, little and perfect for a toddler
B004AHMCKA|4|Great wheel to keep bub entertained. The only complaint is the sucking of the suction cup onto the tray. It says it has to be wet but even when I wet it, it sucks for less than 5 min and it falls off...
B004R5V8E6|4|This definitely does the job.  I will say it was smaller than I expected but my daughter is 10 months, in the 90th percentile for height and 80th for weight, and still fits fine in this.  I would say it would be easier if something lifted up to get her in and out of it.  I love the colors and she plays with the attached knobs sometimes.  All in all it does the job and she enjoys it.
B0013K1NXE|5|Exactly what we needed. Main use was to lay a blanket for our dog to hang out with us in the backyard without risking ticks and ants on him. Our dog loves it and its so practical looks good and easy to fold and carry.
B001H0GEYS|2|We're returning this because the headrest (which is not removable) forced my daughters head FORWARD -- I'm not sure if it's an unsafe angle, but it certainly was uncomfortable.  Also, the arms are incredibly flimsy and I'm sure would break within weeks.  The only thing I love about this seat is the rotating lever to tighten the shoulder straps (which is why we bought it in the first place).
B00029TCXK|4|Great table for the price, it includes a changing pad but it is really flimsy, order a standard changing pad when you purchase.
B008EN8KS4|5|These straps were really easy to install. It seems to make the furniture in my childs room more safe. I would buy them again
B000CGX7WU|3|this is ok, holds pretty securely and is very lightweight.  What I did not like was that our daughter outgrew this thing so fast that we hardly got any use out of it.
B00NOOUUHW|5|Phenomenal car seat!  My 4 year old child (36 lbs, 41 inches) can sleep in it comfortably without slouching forward.  Also, it's lightweight and although a little bulky, it's fairly easy to travel with (check on airplane).  In fact, we bought this specifically for using in a rental car while traveling.  Very pleased.  Recaro makes great car seats and added bonus: this one is assembled in the USA.
B00P6JY8MG|4|Had my concerns after battling with folding a cosco pack n play. Wanted a 4moms breeze playard but coulddn't justify the exorbitant price of it. Settled for this and so glad I did, folds quickly, easily and tidily and despite very heavy use on a recent vacation still going strong!  My only complaint is that  the changing table isnt level at all so very inconvenient to use, but with the mattress at the bassinet height we used this as a changing surface instead  and didn't bother using the attachment.
B002EEO68M|5|Very nice.
B000BYBWI4|1|I typically don't write reviews, but I felt it necessary to do so in this case.  I bathe my newborn (6 weeks old) son in this tub on the kitchen table.  I've used this about 5 times, with the 5th being the last.  The plug came open and leaked ALL of the water onto the table and floor.  I thought maybe my son had accidentally knocked the plug out, so I tried it again.  No luck, the plug came undone again and doesn't stay closed anymore.  Also, this tub is not newborn/infant friendly-I had to have my husband hold my son while I washed him because he would slide around so much in the tub.  It was also very difficult to inflate (unfortunately, I had to do it the old fashioned way as I don't have a pump)!  I honestly don't have anything positive to say about this tub.  Don't buy it!  I had to rate this 1 star, I wanted to rate it 0 stars!
B000JHN3AS|4|My wife and I recently traveled with our two year old twin girls.  The product works exactly as advertised, with just two minor compains.      1 - My wife had a really hard time balancing the weight of the toddler + car seat + suitcase.  She had to push hard on the extended handle to keep it balanced which was akward.  I was able to hold it a little lower which made it easier.    2 - You really need a very sturdy suitcase to use with this strap.  We had two suitcases; one sturdy, one a little more \\"light weight\\".  The light suitcase's wheels struggled with the weight and the handle flexed quite a bit!  The sturdy suitcase (a Kirkland business carry-on case) had no problems.    Overall, we are satisfied with the product.
B003M2XM8A|5|beautiful!
B002G1ZPWO|5|This is a beautiful table. I purchased it thinking it might not be a good size but it is perfect. I would recommend this to anyone who has or is starting up a in home daycare. It is affordable and good quality.
B00UIDDOIO|5|I love these! My almost 4 month old son is a TANK and I could not find any infant bibs in stores that fit around his neck! These are great. Two sets of snaps so there are multiple options for sizing. Smallest one fits him the best, so there is lots of room to grow and they will last a long time! Milk/saliva doesn't seep through to the backside either, so his shirts stay nice and dry vs soaking wet. Def worth the money!
B00KSABSY4|5|Members of the family that are not babies wanted one to make the Texas summer heat more bearable. Made of foam so doesn't hurt anybody if fingers get in the way, conveniently clamps on most surfaces (I used mine on an outdoor restaurant table while baby was being held). Very convenient!
B007V9AG1Q|5|This crib is amazing! The color is beautiful, it was easy to put together. No scratches or dent, despite the shape of the box.
B00A72MXPG|4|The car seat is light but there is no cushion so u need to buy a insert. The stroller is light and is very comfortable. For the price it's a good buy.
B004BYY72S|1|This is old version can't fit the hold bar, If you need hold bar you may choice new one! !
B006OE22MA|5|I have a teeny tiny 20 month old who is interested in potty training. These fit her perfect and absorb most accidents. Her clothes still get wet, but the floor is spared.
B00EE8ZADQ|5|Love this product!!
B00UW7BWXA|5|Silicon Baby freezer trays are amazing I love how u can blend your own stuff and freeze it.

These storage trays can also be used for breast milk storage, Baking Cupcakes, Ice Cube trays, Ice pops, A Chocolate Mold, and virtually anything you need to bake, freeze or store.<br /><br />.I received this product to test and review However my opinions are my
B000GEDQ92|5|WOW!  I can't believe this adorable horse is so inexpensive!  Purchased the &#34;natural&#34; color for my daughter's 1st birthday and it looks just as it does in the picture.  Both my 1 & 3 year olds love playing on it.  We've had a few of the yarn hairs come out.  Other than that, I think it deserves 5 stars for appearance, quality, ease of putting together and low price.
B0083TU2K8|5|These are a perfect size.  We use them daily.  They clean easily and the zipper keeps them nicely sealed.  I've washed them in the washer and dryer and they came out good as new.
B004FN0ZCQ|4|The seat looks very nice and very solid than what my 4 year old was using, sleeping in this car is better.
B001MTELIK|4|Works well for my needs my daughters room is right next to mine, and it works good, the battery life does not last long so we keep ours plugged in all the time.
B004W8I8DW|5|We get lots of compliments on this pretty swaddle blanket.  It's so light, and BIG! It creates the perfect comfy swaddle for your infant.  I aim to get more in other patterns!  Lovely.
B007D1O4CO|3|there definitely is a little trick to getting the bubbles to stick to one another and stay stuck...one wrong move and they all pop off!  i ordered a set for my almost 2yr old daughter (after reading mixed reviews) and thought this would be an economical gift for other toddlers on my list this holiday season...but because it does require a certain &#34;finesse&#34;...others might get frustrated with it.  i did, however, order one extra for my niece (also almost 2) because even if it doesn't work perfectly, i know my sister won't think i just passed some crappy gift onto her!
B00568MPX6|4|Works as it should
B00E48TR30|5|It shipped quick and it is cute as a button. Surprised my husband with it he loved it and we can't wait for our son to wear it.
B00BHPHZM8|1|I looked at a good amount of diaper bags online before choosing this one. I got the purple color as it matched the theme that we chose for our daughter. I bought it before I had my daughter so I did not use it until after the normal return period otherwise I would have returned it!<br />The zippers on both bags broke on the second use. Nothing too heavy was in it and I was not rough on it. While I was trying to fix the zipper on one (as this was only the second time I had used it) I noticed that on the inside of the bag near the opening their was mold..... absolutely GROSS! This was the SECOND day I used it and it had remained inside of the amazon plastic packaging up until this point and had only been stored for a month in a not damp place.<br /><br />Cosmetically the lighter color was a gross yellow/white, and the purple was NOT as pictured. It was extremely faded and like a yellow/purple color.<br />I would NOT recommend to anyone.
B00337P1ZG|5|We love this set, it is good quality, and lots to add to a room.  Now we just need the baby, and the nursery is complete!
B00KX5VGDM|5|These are great! They stick on cold windows and I have not had a problem with them falling off. The shade casts a perfect little shadow over my baby so the sun is not in her eyes. Worth the $20!
B00MRZIFD0|5|Took me a second to figure out how this cup works but it has been the best cup I've purchased for my 2 yr old. Very easy to clean and does not spill or leak. Will be purchasing more!
B000H1IYXW|4|This product does exactly as expected, but there are a few issues.  One issue is that it is a little tricky to install, although not really that bad. Once in place, it does exactly as expected and gives us peace of mind that or son will not fall off the bed while sleeping.  On the other hand, a big concern is that, as many children do, our son loves to walk and jump around on the bed.  When the child is doing that, they could easily fall over this device, causing them to fall from a much higher height then if they just fell off the bed itself.  This is a concern that I had not thought of, and while it has not happened to us yet, I can imagine that it must have happened to other children, and it is something that concerns us and is something that you might want to think about.
B0012S5HRU|5|Excelente!!!
B000F3OEEK|5|When our Graco Snugride began to flip on its side every time we turned a corner, and our daughter hadn't even hit 20 lbs, we were appalled. It was back to the drawing board on the carseat front, and again we found ourselves muddled in research studies on safety.     We had looked at the Marathon previous to buying the Snugride, but had settled on the Snugride because the safety ratings seemed to be comparable and the price was much more reasonable.     I felt as if the Snugride had different levels of safety depending on the car we put it in. Some backseats didn't seem to accomodate it as well, and it would rest at an odd angle no matter how we repositioned it.     The Britax Marathon, for its mammoth size, fits quite well in different vehicles - even in the smallest of cars. It is currently installed in a 2006 Saturn Ion, rear-facing, with the LATCH system. It doesn't interfere with visibility at all, and doesn't hinder adjustment of the seats for taller (6ft plus) drivers.    It feels sturdy and formidable, and sits upright with no trouble. It doesn't give an inch in terms of side-to-side rocking or front to back movement. For the first time, I put my daughter in her seat and truly feel that she is secure. My daughter loves the level of comfort - it's very cushy and velvety soft, and she can easily fall asleep during car rides. The \\"Hugs\\", which some people find annoying, seem to pad her neck from the straps. I don't mind them though occasionally they get turned around the wrong way, leaving an extra step in fastening her in.     My only two (rather minor) complaints are that the straps do tend to get twisted - and are a bit confusing to untangle. I often forget to velcro them in \\"open\\" position, which would prevent this to a great degree. Secondly, I don't always hear a click when I fasten the belt, and somehow that click equates to safety on some level in my mind. Nonetheless the belt does fasten, and doesn't come loose, so I suppose this is my own hangup.    All around this is a great seat, easy to install, attractive, comfy, and highly recommended to the safety-oriented parent.
B007L7FKN2|5|Very happy with my last purchase. I am always pleased with the products and the fast service that I receive from Amazon. Great Job!!!
B002S0NR14|5|I love this bedding. The colors are perfect and it makes a cute theme that you can keep into the toddler years.
B009SYEVXG|5|Super cute and great deal.  My 9 year old girls love them.  I bought 2.  Can't beat the price !
B00CXNUOE4|5|I bought this rocker for my son and daughter-in-law. They love it! My son is using it while they wait for their baby to arrive. It is well made, very pretty , glides easily and is very comfortable.
B0009XBXIQ|3|After thousands of hours of research, I FINALLY purchased a double stroller.  Though the Phil & Ted Vibe [[ASIN:B00166HCGC Brand NEW! Phil & Teds Vibe Buggy With Doubles Kit- Red]]was in consideration for a little while, the final pair I narrowed it down to were the Joovy Caboose UltraLight [[ASIN:B000P229NY Joovy Caboose Ultralight Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black]]and the Baby Trend Sit N Stand PLUS [[ASIN:B000IHTD8A Baby Trend Silverado Sit N' Stand Plus Double Stroller]].      Ultimately, what is good for you is going to depend alot on the age of your kids, how often you plan to use it, and under what conditions.  My daughters are 3  months and 2 1/2 years old.  Realistically, I didn't think I'd be using this double stroller all that much, but I wanted to have one for the times when I knew I would need it.  In my case, the winner ended up being the Baby Trend Sit N Stand Plus.  Here's why:    PHIL & TED VIBE:[[ASIN:B00166HCGC Brand NEW! Phil & Teds Vibe Buggy With Doubles Kit- Red]]  I was initially attracted to this one because of its compact design and light weight.  I also liked the Vibe over the other P&T models because you don't need to take the jumpseat off in order to fold it up (according to the website anyway).  But in reality, folding this thing up was kind of a pain.   Next-- In the \\"infant + toddler\\" mode, I kind of felt like I was putting my infant in the glove compartment.  Talk about claustrophobic! Thinking down the line, in the \\"2 toddlers mode\\", it seemed that accessing your children in this stroller is not all that easy.  The jump seat does not recline, and it is not particularly accessible.  I pictured myself trying to squeeze a sleeping toddler into that \\"underbasket\\" seat and I figured I was asking for trouble.  Lastly, I just couldn't justify the cost (nearly $900 with the doubles kit) given that I didn't think I was going to use it that often.  However, it did handle well and was very light. Despite its maneuverability, the cons seemed toogreat in comparison to the cost (plus it is not compatabile with ANY car seat)    JOOVY CABOOSE ULTRALIGHT:[[ASIN:B000P229NY Joovy Caboose Ultralight Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black]]  Certainly a better price than that Vibe!  Was surprisingly light and easy to maneuver. It was actually compatible with my Combi car seat (which is rare). My 2 1/2 year old seemed to really like standing on the platform in the store.  I actually almost bought this one except for three major things:    1) The folding mechanism is annoying.  You need to use two hands. When you have two kids in tow, you often don't have one free hand-- let alone two. Especially if you are someplace like a shopping center parking lot, or a city street, where you need your eyes and ears alert as well as your hands free.  2)  It occurred to me that even though my 2 1/2 year old seemed to enjoy riding in the store during the test drive, what would happen after several hours at the zoo? She stills needs a good 90 minute nap everyday, in the middle of the day.  I could foresee that this could be a problem because there is no way to carry an infant AND a napping toddler.   As much as I WANTED to like this stroller, I realized that its probably better if your kids are both over the age of 3 vs. having both kids under the age of 3. But I really liked the idea of a Sit N Stand because I knew it wouldn't be long before my oldest wouldn't need to sit in the seat at all, but I probably had a decent amount of time where I would still need the \\"full seat\\" capability.    3) The seat/platform area on the Joovy was really small with the infant seat installed. So even if my daughter wanted to sit and take a break, it would hardly be comfortable. (and she's small too, so I can only imagine what it would be like when she got older)    BABY TREND SIT n STAND PLUS  [[ASIN:B000IHTD8A Baby Trend Silverado Sit N' Stand Plus Double Stroller]]  After much research, I discovered the Sit N Stand PLUS.  This is a step up from the basic Sit N Stand, in that it can convert from a compact tandem stroller with 2 full seats to a traditional Sit N Stand.  Problem Solved!! The back seat even reclines a bit (but not fully) for the toddler to nap. The back seat removes easily, and can be folded up into the storage basket while still allowing room to carry stuff. Even though it officially is not compatible with the Combi car seat, it actually seemed pretty darn secure when I tried it. I can take my infant along, and not worry about the toddler needing to nap. And when the toddler wants to stand and ride, she can do that too. It only takes a minute to take the seat out.  Unlike the Joovy, there is plenty of space on the bench seat and in the standing area.  The one-hand fold is easy and effortless to use!  It includes both a parent tray and child snack tray (with cupholders) and you can access the basket easily from the sides even if your child is in the back seat.  It includes full sun canopies for both seats, which are also easily removed when not needed. I put it right next to the Joovy Caboose Ultralight in the store and they had the exact same wheelbase (length from from wheels to back wheels-- so I'm not sure why people are saying its longer than the Caboose? To top it off, this stroller is about $100 less than the Joovy.   This stroller is certainly not perfect... it IS heavier than the Joovy or the Phil & Ted and no, it does not turn quite as easily (though not significantly harder either).  However, given the cost difference; the frequency of usage that I think I'll have; and the potential longevity as my daughter grows out of the seat and into the standing only preference... getting this one seemed like a no-brainer compared to the significantly more expensive Phil & Ted and Joovy.
B002G1ZPWO|5|I bought this table in white, as an alternative to the large obnoxious train tables. My sons room is a little on the small side and this table works as an art table (we also purchased a green chair from Ikea), we also use it as a play table for cars and other toys but most importantly the oval thomas tracks and accessories that we own fit perfectly on this table. And if I pull it away from the wall he has access to the entire track and it still doesn't take over his room.<br /><br />The table did come with a bolt (1 out of 8) that didnt fit the table but we had extra bolts from cribs and what not so it wasnt a big deal for us and it was simple to put together.
B008CM582S|3|The blanket is nice and soft, but after you wash it the fuzz balls from the blanket will be on all your laundry. Now I have to buy a lint roller to get rid of the fuzzies from my clothes. Not thrilled about that.<br />And the blanket got a small rip after the first machine wash. They should change the label to hand wash only .
B00DVO0YN0|5|This is the only pacifier that my breastfed baby will take! We have tried everything and I highly recommend them!
B005X9X2WG|4|SO I JUST RECEIVED THE SNACK TRAY SO I DID NOT GIVE IT 5 STARS, BUT I INITIALLY AGREED THAT THE TOP OF THE TRAY WOULD FALL OFF WAY TOO EASILY.  I NOTICED A NOTCH INSIDE THE TWO PART AND TWISTED THE TWO PARTS TOGETHER. AFTER ONE OR TWO QUICK TRYS I LEARNED THAT THEY SNAP TOGETHER AND LOCK IN PLACE. I HOPE THIS HELPS SOME PEOPLE OUT. I THINK I'LL BE VERY HAPPY WITH THIS.
B00CG3CE4Y|5|Great product! Love these bibs !! Great coverage! I would recommend them highly! I will buy them for baby gift when needed!
B00JL6LP30|5|I think for the price, its great. It's exactly what is was wanting and needed. It's simple and modern. It seems durable and sturdy. I'm not afraid to put my baby in it. Easy to put together, just make sure you follow the directions.
B004OYWY98|5|This is by far my son's favorite teether. He is very picky about what kinds of teethers he will use and (I've tried a variety to help soothe his gums) and he uses this one daily. He likes to brush his gums, the massaging soothes his achey gums, which makes me very happy with this purchase. I plan on buying more for backups. You have made one teething baby very happy.
B00H8MRBDM|4|So far so good, easy assembly. This will be for our first baby and I did a lot nd reviews and this  Seems like  a great starter stroller and car seat so I hope it doesn't disappoint us. Baby due anyday
B00BZAFTZA|2|I bought this for my daughter in-law. She used it for about 2 weeks and the seam split out. I tried to contact the supplier &#34;Fisher Price&#34; but I never recieved a response to remody the dispute. In turn Amazon ended up giving me full credit because they gaurenteed the seller. I still have the bag, but it is worthless.
B0038JE5Z6|5|We bought one of these for our spice cupboard and it worked so well that we bought a second. The split level is good for variable heights of spice bottles, but it does come at a cost that the divider between the two splits means that not as many bottles can fit on the top, especially if they're larger bottles.
B00LDA01FK|5|Sooooo incredibly soft! My three year old daughter loves it!
B000J2DQPA|5|Very pleased with the stroller.  Price was definitely a plus.  Fast shipping and good communication.
B0064Y3VK2|4|I'm a mom of twins and I absolutely love this stroller I got the stroller for walks only and it's perfect. This is absolutely not ideal for travel I have a tandem stroller for that purpose only as it is much more compact than the babytrend which is why I didn't give it 5 stars it's very heavy but other than that I'm completely happy with my choice.
B004DC9TA8|5|Good shock absorbers and easy maneuverability.  Not the lightest stroller but best functionality when not just running to the grocery store.
B006Z6E8AG|5|very good! I like it very much, my daughter also likes it .it's a wonderful design to baby and mum
B00814ZC14|5|I like these better than any reuseable bag bc of material , easier to clean & just wipe down  on the inside and outside. I like packing fruit salad for my kids in these. Better than itzy ritzy bags we own. I will buy more! Cute designs
B003FQ5P7O|5|Great sturdy ottoman that works perfectly with the LC Glider! It rocks smoothly and we love the fabric, color, and height.
B00005YVRM|4|I really like the colors in the toy. They are fun to look at. The music is great too although it frightens my 8 month old son. He's been using this toy since he was 7 months old. It was hard for him at first because there is no tension keeping it from moving. I had to stand in front of it to keep it from moving so fast. Now he does it with ease. It seems to work better for beginners on the carpet. Then once they get the hang of it they can move it onto the hardwood floors. I love the idea of the balls. My son loves to play with them. What kid doesn't. He doesn't use the basket quiet yet but I know in time he will. I also like that it turns into a riding toy. A two for one deal.
B000096QDC|5|Prompt & good contition
B006WU9S7I|5|i love this diaper.  As easy as disposable but without those nasty plastics against my baby’s skin.  Easy to wash, easy to dry (i use the dryer because its really humid here), and so easy the husband or the grandparents can easily use it.
B008HPP7XA|5|I searched for a while for what to replace my old worn out spring crib mattress with. It was used when we got it and I'm on my 3rd child using it so it badly needed replacing.I LOVE this mattress! I love my memory foam bed so why wouldn't my son?! He has slept so much better after we got this for him, he's 10 months old. I love that the cover is waterproof but is not crinkly or loud and is super soft. I put the crib sheet right over the top of it, no need to purchase another cover. I love that this has squared corners and leaves NO gaps in my crib like our old rounded corner mattress did. This mattress is firm yet comfortable. I wouldn't hesitate to put ANY age baby on this mattress, even a newborn. No smell either, expanded to full size in a day or two and ready to use! Get this mattress, you won't regret it!
B007UYBOK4|5|safe,suit my car(ford,focus)
B0034ISZDO|3|3 Stars, it's &#34;okay&#34;, I agree.  Saved my hands from holding the cups up for the pump.<br /><br />I dinged it because of the &#34;bra style&#34; hooks . Those are such a pain.  I bought the Medela one which has a zipper in the front and is so much easier to use.  Be warned though, the zipper can spring open if it's tight enough while these hooks probably would hold up to more pressure.
B00RBTJZRM|5|Perfect towel for a little guy
B004QZBEDM|3|We purchased this hamper after reading the reviews and watching the video.  We were really impressed by the fact that you can fold it up and store it away. However, when we got it, we realized that we never store it away.. we are always using it for our LO.  One con about this is that we don't know how to wash it... I put a wet clothes in the basket once and it left a wet stain... After that, I realized that I can't put wet clothes in here and I don't know how to clean the dried up wet spot.  The hamper is sturdy and does its job, but I wish I got another hamper that I could actually wash..
B0051Y1L1W|4|We needed a double stroller for our nanny share, and we already had the Uppababy Vista and Rumble Seat.  The babies are both 3 months old, and the Rumble seat says not to use with children under 6 months.  I decided to see if this insert would work, and it did!  Note: my 3mo does have unusually good neck/head control for his age, but I still say go for it.  Certainly saved us a bundle not having to buy another $300 stroller!
B00ICSSQIK|4|The fabric is really soft. Since it is made for the mattress, it fits perfectly as well.
B001WAJVZM|5|We did have to put a zip tied on it to make it stay on, but it has very much served it's purpose and protected my son from several injuries
B000X4WORU|5|I can't believe it has taken me four babies to find this sling! As a busy mom, I need about eight arms. This sling has at least given me my own two arms back. I've tried other wraps, slings, and carriers but they are all uncomfortable for the baby. This wrap gives me so many options that I can carry my baby how he wants to be held. The soft fabric just cradles him but holds him tight and secure. I also love that it fits me perfectly. I'm no model after having four children, but it would fit a model too. It is also easy to get in and out of. We take it shopping, on walks, or to the zoo. I use it frequently just around the house when my baby wants to be held but I have things to get done or children to play with. A+!!! I can't praise it enough.
B004GCJMLG|5|If you buy these, you won't be disappointed.  Admittedly, they are a little bit of a pain to install and line everything up, but so far, I have yet to find a baby proofing product that isn't.  They are an exercise in patience, but as you progress through the first two or three it becomes much easier.  Our 1 year old couldn't resist opening the cabinets in our entertainment center, kitchen, and built-ins, once these were installed it only took a couple of days for him to realize he wouldn't be able to open the cabinets anymore and now he doesn't even try.  We ordered two sets, so fortunately we received two keys which we strategically placed in our home.  The only negative I can think with these, is if you lose the key.  It's only a magnet, so it will be easy to replace, but if you lose the key and don't have a magnet around and need to get into a cabinet, you are going to be very, very annoyed.  That's not enough reason to give this any less than 5 stars though, that's the design, so you know it going in.
B009OZMQYU|4|Works as expected. I was trying to decide between this and the VTech monitor and decided I didn't want to deal with batteries. This works if even away from baby, you will be fairly situated and not moving around.  Otherwise, even at highest setting, I have trouble hearing baby in the next room.
B00H1AGZ1A|3|I'm now on my second child and used a handmade pumping bra from an old bra the first time so I decided to upgrade a bit this time.  Pros for this include ease of use and not needing to worry about what to do with your clothing when putting it on.  It holds up the pump well and don't worry about anything falling off.  Lightweight and easily transported.  Cons are that the clips dig into your neck and if lifting your shirt up your back as well.  It gets twisted pretty easily and the straps can snap back at you if you aren't careful.<br /><br />All that being said, I'm happy with the product and will continue to use it!
B003CK3LDI|5|My daughter has had one of these since she was a newborn. She's 2 now & doesn't go anywhere without it.  She literally wears them out.  I buy them 2 at a time so I can always have a clean one available.  She loves hers so much!
B005MQRHTE|1|I used this in our City Mini stroller, but it was completely worthless. The head support did not actually support my son's head. Additionally, the snaps did not hold, so the product kept sliding. We returned it due to safety concerns. I would not recommend this product for use in the City Mini stroller.
B004YL3332|5|Fantastic product for eating out with a toddler. Does not stick well to table cloths but for tables they are great. Easy clean up.
B000LP7840|5|I just had my third baby boy and own many strollers. My latest was the Joovy sit and stand. Which doesn't hold my infant car seat. I bought this one and I love it. It was easy to put together and easy to use. My infant car seat fits in the front or back. It is a little tight in the back but over all it works just fine.
B000067K0L|5|This is the best baby playmat in the WORLD!  My son loves it and so do we!
B00G3H0G2G|3|Works of what is need for but very flimsy wish they would have put wood or cardboard on the sides of the tray to make it sturdy.
B00XHMPSVO|2|Once again the sizing is sooo wrong.  Very disappointed!!!  Cute shoe but that is it!
B001NIN992|5|Really enjoyed using this product with my new born. It gave me some sort of freedom of my arms to do a bit here and there while my baby was close and comfortable with me. I think it lasted up until 5 or six months for us then my child just didn't want to be freer and not so restricted.
B004S11PG0|5|My 2 year old is all torso and close to outgrowing her Sunshine Kids Radian 80SL rear facing so when we needed a seat for the other vehicle we needed the tallest available. I have heard about people ordering car seats only to receive older manufacturer dates so I checked before we even opened the box. It was manufactured the same month we purchased so we will be getting the full use out of the seat.
B00LKUVNHI|5|I initially got these for my baby as I like to make his baby food, but found these pouches very helpful for smoothies on the go for breakfast for my 3 and 5 year olds! These bags are good size, 6oz. I blend up fruit, yogurt, spinach and pill up into these pouches secured by zip lock. Side open and screw on clamp, easy for kids to drink. I don't have time to make in the morning, but these pouches have made a busy moms life easier! Easy to wash, dishwasher safe.
B003FIO7OE|1|These crib rail protectors are horrible. My baby is able to pull them off and it's a game of putting them back on so they can be ripped off and thrown on the floor. A complete waste of money.
B001OC5UNA|5|I previously bought  15 dollar gate from Walmart. Thought I could save some money. Fitted poorly, and my puppy who weighs only 15 pounds could knock it over. Spent a little extra with this but so worth it. Fits to any doorway quality product.<br /><br />Just wanted to come back and say I've been using this for years and it's held up nicely<br /> Highly recommend
B00AA7TDUG|4|This is super cute and very handy for a quick swaddle.  The velcro helps keep the swaddle in place without being too tight.
B001B9Q1AM|5|This mat is a comfy, no-skid resting place for baby.  It's also Vinyl-free, which was what we were looking for most of all.  While a cover isn't necessary (according to the previous review), we just use a towel on top which works fine.  We've been using this mat for 4+ months and have not had any trouble with it harming the top of our antique dresser used as a changing table.
B00BGDEZOM|4|Very pretty and bright with multiple colors to blend into most color schemes.
B00D2ZK028|5|Works great! Keeps my 2 year old from opening the oven.
B007700SEO|5|very cute. keeps baby occupied while driving. very colorful  would definitely recommend to other moms.
B00GHM86AQ|1|This stroller has been a HUGE disappointment.  I purchased all the Orbit Baby G3 products because I was told that they were the best on the market.  Within six weeks the stroller frame is broken.  Three wheels do not move so it is hard to steer and barely moves in a straight line. This makes it very hard to get around and makes the other Orbit Baby items I purchased (Basinet & Car Seat) a waste of money.<br /><br />Now to make the situation even more frustrating.  Not only is the stroller almost unusable and almost $1300 down the drain Orbit Baby customer service is horrendous.  I work in retail and understand the importance of customer service.  When my stroller was acting up I went on orbit baby's website and  I registered my product then submitted my complaint based on their instruction.  I was told someone would respond within one business day.  After 8 days of no response, I emailed again.  NO RESPONSE.  I then called and spoke to a customer service member named Paul who asked me if I had taken apart the base to put it back together and see how it worked.  I explained to him that if the stroller is broken after six weeks of use, I would like it replaced not to mention I am a new mom and not an engineer and do not have time to take the stroller apart to figure out what is wrong.  He then explained that he would only send me a new pair of wheels which I told him not to because that wouldn't fix the issue.  He told me he would call me in an hour.  NO CALL.  I, again, reached out then was told that Paul would reach out to me in an hour.  Three hours later, I receive an email telling me he was sending me wheels.<br /><br />I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone based on their customer service alone.  We spent a fortune on this system only to be treated with little to no respect by the company.  It is a great concept because the system is very easy to use and compatible but the quality does not warrant the price!
B00H3KWJ4U|4|These are great storage containers
B00H8MSKAU|5|No re-thread straps are awesome, easy to install, rear faces to 40lbs forward faces to 65lbs so this seat will last from birth to booster!! Great choice!
B00IMKQCEI|5|Excelente!!!<br />Tiene todo lo que necesita buena tela 100 algodón y la foto no le hace justicias es mas hermoso cuando tienes el producto en tus manos
B000UYFULU|5|I Love Baby K'tan, Just What I Need To Hold Baby And Still Be Hands Free<br />ItAllows Me To Get So Much DoNe, And MyFavorite Activity In Baby K'tan Is Exercising WithMy Little One
B0035RQWCK|4|After I finally figured out how to open it up (look for the black clamp release on the side!), then it was fine.  Lightweight, easy to use.  Shows wear quickly, but still works fine anyway, and a good value for the low price I paid on Amazon.  I'm not a Cosco member, so was glad to find this product available here too!
B001COIH3A|2|Despite reviews about poor sound I bought this monitor hoping that as one reviewer suggested, the sound problem was due to user error. Not the case with my monitor. My unit was clearly defective and produced very low sound and was also intermittently insensitive despite turning the sensitivity and volume all the way up. It was NOT difficult to figure out how to work those controls after a quick read of the manual. So back to Amazon this will go. I am disappointed, this otherwise seemed like a great product with very good range. I don't think I'll bother with another one because I am not sure if the poor sensitivity would occur if it was not defective.
B00D04R2JK|3|OK let's start this off by saying I love britax products! But I extremely do not like this Booster :( everytime I went to take it out of the car the back part that is attached to the Booster would always fall backwards and/or fall off :( but I love the fact that there is a buckle that goes between there legs to thread the lap belt through to prevent submerging! So it's a toss up deal with the annoyance of the back portion to benefit the non submerging of your child :)
B002SG7JSU|2|Too easy for baby to rip off of the furniture :( I think I'd be better off using the kind that wraps the entire edge of a table...might be easier for him to remove.
B004BDOIAU|2|Cute but mine did not include the clean touch inkpad which was the main reason I had chosen this book over others.
B0007ORN7M|5|This product is wonderful!!  My three month and three year old love it.  What a great alternative to baby sitting on your lap.&#60;br /&#62; Definitely a must have on your baby registry.
B00FUR01PW|4|Very nice made out of cardboard soo can loose shape
B0012LZD5I|5|Excelent
B000ECX1VE|5|We just purchased the wagon for our trip to Disney with our 1 1/2 and 4 1/2 year old boys.  It was great for getting around the airports and folds down nicely.  Here's how it worked at Disney:  When we got to the park, we were told by the greeter that no pull wagons were allowed but we could still use it if we pushed.  We pushed it through the gate (a struggle) and went on our way pulling.  No one stopped us for the rest of the day.  At the end of the day, we agreed the wagon worked pretty well - no major complaints but it seemed other guests were passively annoyed by its length and width - it was the only wagon we saw at the park so I suspect others weren't ready for it and in congested areas the maneuverability was not optimal.  The second day, we opted to rent a 2 kid stroller and that worked much better.  For the remainder of the week trip we rented strollers at all parks because they provided the same or more utility and were more convenience.  That said, we are still quite pleased with the wagon.  We plan to use it all the time this summer.  It is not hard to pull and the kids love it.  We also purchased a matching cooler that attaches to the back and that has come in handy.  All in all, if the only reason for the purchase is for a Disney trip, I would pass.   However, for general use, its a winner.
B002QCZ9ZQ|5|Looked for a long time for a neutral, sheep-themed bedding set.  This has a nice design and is affordable.  It held up well in the washer.
B005PK1DEM|5|I bought this for our van for the grand kids and it is the perfect size.  It's not so big<br />that it is in the way it is JUST RIGHT!
B0009FIMPG|1|This is a piece of junk if you think you're getting a spill proof cup. All my 15 month old son has to do is shake it and Cheerios fly everywhere.
B004GCJMLG|4|They worked better than expected. The template that comes with them makes installing them very easy. Just be careful not to drill too deep on the doors and go through the front. The magnet key is surprisingly strong.
B005DE9IYC|1|The range on this camera absolutely useless. I bought this camera to monitor my daughter while we were outside at our vacation house and cannot get more than 50' from her window it totally doesn't work while on the other side of the house. Also it's not as easy to view remotely as they make it appear... Two Skype accounts, PC, handheld monitor plugged into PC, Bla Bla Bla. Might be ok if you are 50' away and have line of site but then do you really need a camera ???????? Will definately be sending this inferior product back.
B00L74F7KG|5|Our 3 year old son loves this pillow.  It's firm for support, but still nice a soft for comfort!
B0081ZOWC8|1|Our baby does not accept it
B003HS5JRG|4|I bought this for my new grandson who is almost 1 month old and he loves this toy. There is a squeeker that is not too loud. There is one problem, the label that is sewn on with the Lamaze Brand is very rough. It seems that the stitching is smooth on one end, but not the other.
B001IXYOD2|4|We used a combination of the Playtex Ventaire and Dr. Brown's during the last 3 weeks with our newborn.  After several nights of her spitting up and fussing when fed with the Ventaire bittles, we switched exclusively to Dr. Brown's.  So far, so good - the baby is feeding without incident and because the vent is through the middle of the bottle versus at the bottom like on the Ventaire (where it can stick if not dried thoroughly after washing), the bottle vents well.  The only difficult aspect of the bottles is the multiple pieces to wash/put together each time - but this is the beneficial design, so it appears to be worth the effort.
B000RFCXIK|5|We are an active family, so we are on the go a lot.  This combo pack allows us to bring formula along without adding too much to my already packed diaper bag.  For shorter period, I use the single serve container, and I don't find myself needing to prepare more then 3 servings when using the larger one.  A friend recommended carrying the prepackaged 4oz single serve powder formula instead.  I find these better suit my needs since it's more economical to pack my own, and my daughter drinks 5 oz serving so the prepackaged stuff will be not enough per serving.
B00J6GNMGI|1|without a doubt fake! there is no way this is real! the only good thing about this was the refund was easy and quick. People who know Coach products will quickly see that this is without a doubt, 100% not a genuine coach product.  They never use fake leather on the trims of their non-leather purses along with inaccuracies in the tags as well.  Other than the fact that the purse is a counterfeit it is cute.  If it was labeled and priced accordingly (like $50 or less) then I would probably have kept it but $250 is only a little less than a real Coach purse so definitely not worth paying that much for a counterfeit product!
B00S5VS8AA|5|My son started teething at just 6 weeks old. At that time I had gotten him a basic dark cherry colored Amber necklace from a different seller. The clasp was just a snap, so as he got older he was able to pull it off easily. My family members also hated the thing because it looked girly. It eventually got lost because he took it off, so I was looking for one that had a screw clasp and I loved that this one had the blue lapis stones to please my husband. My son is 1yr and already has almost all of his teeth cut through, so teething has been stressful for everyone. Since he has had this necklace, he has not been drooling, and the horrible rash he had on his face is gone! It is a great size and fits perfectly around his ankle when wrapped twice. He has been sleeping much better at night as well. I have not had any issues with the blue transferring on his skin so far. I would absolutely recommend this necklace and will only order from The Art of Cure from now on.
B00EYUD9MI|5|Huge hit!
B005ZBHXOA|5|This seat does a good job of keeping my little boy in his chair. The seat stays on the chair well and doesn't slip around. Food and drinks wipe off easily and don't leave any stains. The seat feels pretty solid and I think it'll last a long time. There's not much more I could ask for in a booster seat. If you use seat cushions like we do, I would recommend either taking it off or putting a towel over the seat cushion to protect your chair from the Tasmanian devil eating above it.
B009WNO91M|5|We have the purple Diono booster for my daughter and just bought this orange one for my son. Our kids are very safe in these seats and the seat belts fit perfectly through the guides. Love the many options this seat has for height/width adjustments, we will never have to buy another seat again!
B00SZ5UGWO|5|product as discribed
B00IYTTO2Y|5|Even though the product says for Baby Food, this can be USED for COCONUT OIL as well!!!! LOVE THIS!!!!
B00JZXMZ6U|5|We love this product and use it with the book pop-up system. It is so easy to use and friendly for family members to use. Love this brand and their products.
B001AWEDCS|5|This little tub is great!  My little 2 month old LOVES bath time! I only used the hammock feature twice, as he was born in winter and the hammock kept him too much out of the water.  But even without the hammock, it worked great to keep his head out of the water with little or no effort.
B002H9WR26|5|I had my eye on this bag when I was in the market for a diaper bag but at that point it had a $100 price tag and I already had a decent bag so I couldn't justify spending that much at that point in time. It ended up sitting in my wish list for a couple years until it finally came down in price. I finally bought it but not for diapers. It is now my camera bag. It's roomy and has adjustable dividers and is just perfect. I can keep my camera and accessories on one side and a sketch pad and a few books on the other. Absolutely love it.
B008R1B01W|4|I like this cup but the only thing I don't like is that the straw goes in when my baby drinks from it. Other than that, practical to take on trips.
B002YWZ79Q|1|I never had stink issues in my front loader HE with another detergent.. after this - its like my dipies where washed with water.. i do not recommend it!
B00352M1RA|1|I would give the Mam pacifier a 5 star, but I'm rating this particular item with 1 star couse you do get any color, bought 2 for my son and got a green set (good) and a purple set.<br />They list an Item model number that correspond to the blue one in the first picture, but you will get any. so save your time and maybe pay a bit more but buy the color you want.
B007M2OQK4|5|Love the bottles.  Thought the smaller nipple would be a problem buy my little one has had no issues at all.
B00K0GNCY0|5|I got this blanket for my baby for 2 reasons 1. So she can't cover her face with her regular blanket she had 2. That she won't be cold since her regular always fell off her by the end of the night. We are very happy with this blanket it fits really well. It does come pretty close to the baby's mouth when you put it on so if your baby likes sucking on stuff you will want to pull it down a bit when you put it on. Also it was a drop thiner than what we expected from the pictures but it keeps our baby really warm and that is all that matters. We will be buying the next size any day now as it is starting to get small on her
B00000J44I|1|This is not what I thought because it has a name already embroidered on it. Also this was a replacement of another one and the fabric is not even close to bring as nice as the one bought directly from North American bear. Very disappointed.
B00I3K25R0|5|Perfect for bath time! I haven't seen any water get in them yet!
B000HK6BCE|2|I am thoroughly disappointed with the experience I had with my order.  I ordered 2 sets of these to install them on 2 different beds.  I opened the first box that arrived and was surprised at how dirty the item was.The white plastic pieces were marked up by brown splotches and the metal pieces had deep scratches.  There was also a number written with a sharpie on the tag.  I thought I somehow got a used set and opened the second set to compare.  I was again surprised that the second set looked exactly like the first but with a different number written on the tag. I can only assume these were used and there was no way I was going to install dirty rails on my bed.  I had to go through the trouble of returning both sets.<br /><br />I decided not to take another chance ordering cheap rails and bought the baby home rail which was more expensive (twice the cost for only 1 rail).  My experience with the baby home rail was more positive (except for the cost).
B006QI1PCW|4|This is cute and my son loves it.  The biggest problem that I have is my 4 year-old daughter turns the mic around and sings while my sone plays the piano!!
B0039MIUXA|5|I was looking for something small but comfortable to put under my desk to rest my feet on.  This stool is absolutely perfect!  The bamboo and quality of the product are amazing for this low price. The slight curve to the edges makes it comfy all around. Nicely done !
B00AIVNBN4|5|my daughter is having a ball with her learning toys. and dad jus loves the baby walker. my daughter can bend her knees a lot better using it. so thanks and loving it too
B0013FCBJO|5|My nephew loves this. Not only cute but seems so soothing to his sore gums. Great gift item as well.
B003XMWFBE|3|We have been using this car organizer for about 2 1/2 years. I do like that it helps stash toys and things in the car and also protects seat backs when your child is forward facing in a car seat. BUT, the top pocket, made of a net/mesh, tore pretty quickly and begame a hazard, the elastic separated from the mesh, and my child's feet would get tangled in it often. I finally just cut that pocket off to avoid the entanglement because I didn't think it would be worth buying another one.
B00JTTBH32|5|Love, it is very large. Made for a single wall. Very easy to remove from backing. Had a difficult time with the right placement of the trunk. It's gorgeous.
B00BMMOKYW|5|We use it a blanket for our baby at home, or tummy time mat or as a carseat canopy when we are out and as a stroller blanket.  We live in San Francisco, it is fall weather all year round, so it is perfect for our weather, not too thick and not too thin.
B00II43SN6|2|I bought this seat for my almost 3 year old. She is on the tallest setting for height and will soon outgrow this seat prior to maxing the weight limit. Not recommended for taller than average toddlers.
B007FF3ZP0|4|After trying several expensive bottles, I switched my son to these. He loves them! They come in fun colors with different safari animals on them. I knocked off a star because sometimes the cap leaks.
B00GEF7CII|3|Great car seat except it's almost impossible to remove the seat cover to wash it.  When you do finally get it removed and wash it, the cover shredded where there is stuffing for the back support and I can't sew it back together because there's not enough material left.  I would have given a much higher rating if I was able to wash the seat cover without it shredding after just one wash.  Also, every difficult to install if you have an older vehicle.
B00E3RK9IE|4|I just saw the price and definitely do not buy for $15. I think I paid $5 and it's worth that. Very small and harder in the middle since there is a rattle. She loves her Taggies pink bear that's very soft and I like how it can be machine washed (I don't think this one can be so clean with damp rag which I don't like),
B0013FGWD0|5|We looked at Target for these, and they were around ten dollars more than we were able to find on Amazon. It fit on the crib wonderfully and looks great
B0042D69XS|3|This is a great and very comfy bouncer.  My son slept in this for about a month (from 4-8 weeks), and now at 5 months he still loves to sit it in while I cook or do dishes.  However, please be careful putting this in the dryer.  The tag says you can machine wash cold and tumble dry low.  Well, the tags melted in my dryer on low and almost caught my house on fire.  It was very scary so please be careful!
B000J2DQPA|5|This was a gift to our grandaughter for the upcoming birth of our second great grandaughter.  She said this stroller is the Rolls Royce of all strollers she has seen or owned.
B004VL2VS8|2|This is for the MBP20- 1.5 Inch screen:  The reviews on this and the related monitors had me very optimistic but sadly it was a very short honeymoon.  I had bought this at a national brick and mortar store which was a good thing as I was able to return it without problems after 2 weeks.  Immediately I noticed that the picture was not very clear either at night or day.  I am not sure if this is due to the 1.5 inch monitor screen, the camera itself or both.  I was able to see my baby but compared to the Summer Best View (old model) it was not the best.  The range of the device was very good as it was able to go through the walls of a pre-war apartment.  The sound transmission was also very good both ways.  About 8-9 days after getting this it would start to make a beeping noise for no apparent reason.  This would occur a few times at 3-4 in the morning.  The only way to stop it was to restart the unit.  Needless to say I did not enjoy getting up at night when I did not have to.  Another thing I did not like about the unit is that the battery drains in about 2-3 hours when in use in portable mode.  This would happen even if I turned off the video which you will need to do as it will not go off automatically as some other brands do to save power.  I traded in the unit for the new Summer Best View but will most likely get a wireless webcam to use to look on baby.
B0031QPN6G|5|- Came in a fairly large box, but wasn't too bad to unpack  - Assembly wasn't too difficult, I put it together myself with the included hardware and the included allen wrench.   - Direction were fairly simple with diagrams etc  - Smooth glider, quiet, comfortable.  - Arrived quickly via Ground Shipping  - Pleased with the product.
B000066665|4|I only bought this tub when sadly I couldn't find an exact replacement for our last inflatable tub. The quality of this one is fine, I have no issues with that. It's just a tad small for my 1 yr old, 28.5 inch baby girl. When she grows another inch or 2 I'll have to find another replacement.  And while I'm complaining :P I'd also like to say that I don't care for the electronic quacker that they placed in the duck's bill. If they really had to put something there, I think an old fashioned squeaker would have been better.  At any rate, if you want to buy this, it's a fine tub. Just make sure to have a larger one on hand when your baby gets to about 30 inches.
B000F1QSAK|2|My little boy apparently doesn't like dolls.  When we first showed it to him, he wanted it put back in the box.  We ended up to potty training the old fashion way.
B002UJGK1C|5|In all aspects very good water bottle.easy to drink, my18 months daughter has it, keeps the water cold and safe.
B005WPPS6E|5|This is one of the best diaper bags I've ever owned. It's roomy and it has tons of pockets. The pattern and color are amazing and the price was even better. It's big enough to hold my newborn's items and my 3 year old's toys and snacks. I absolutely love my charcoal JJ satchel.
B00003TL7P|2|I recently bought a Diaper Champ but will have to return it because the drum doesn't turn. The blue rubber seal snags every time on the white plastic and makes you really have to use a lot of force to turn the drum over to dispose of the diaper. I'm sure not every model is defective like ours is, but it is discouraging and I'm not sure I'll get another Champ to replace this one.
B002N5QIOC|5|Very light material. Great for summer time naps in hot climates. The material is a little fragile though.
B00449RHH2|5|I was super lucky to stumble upon these diapers when I was looking to start clothing diapering.  These diapers are half the price of your average pocket diaper, yet they fit well, are durable, and have the cutest designs.  I've been using them for 10 months now and they're still in really great condition despite numerous washes.  They also have great customer service and a 15 day wash and wear return policy.
B00ZSB739W|5|These are the best cloth diapers we've tried. Smart bottoms are super trim and absorbent! My favorites!!! So worth the price and the initial 5-6 washes. Loooveeee.
B0052QYLUM|4|Work great.  I work at home in another building next to the house and I get the reception I need.  The graphic on the monitor isn't very vivid, but you can tell what the baby is doing.
B0007V644S|5|You get a lot for the money, they have great handles to tie the bag tightly and a subtle powdery smell. Not overwhelming.<br />I've used these for a while now.  Good product.
B0000UQQW6|5|I took this stroller through the city of Montreal with my 6 weeks old daughter. The city have many nooks and crannies that are paved with cobblestone, needless to say, the shock absorber on this stroller was excellent. Some streets were so rocky that I thought I would lose a wheel but the stroller kept up. The bug net is really great and acts as a wind breaker during those windy days also. With many pockets and generous basket,my husband and I was able to pack supplies for a whole day excursion including his camera, camcorder, binocular, etc and a full diaper bag. The reclining seat is perfect for my newborn to lie down and just enjoy the fresh air. With a very reasonable price tag attached, this is a must have for any new parents!
B000056C86|4|I have not checked it's weight(it is probable my fault), but this play pen, even though very clorful and lovely, is VERY heavy. We live in an apartment building and I was hoping to be able to use it when I go to the pool with my 6 month old, but no way can I lif both. I wish it was lighter. Everything else about it is true.
B00003TL7P|5|I registered for this after reading all the reviews and I've been nothing but happy with it. I tried my sister's diaper genie and the diaper champ is so much easier to use. The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier. I just leave some in the bottom of the champ then I don't have to go looking for them. I've never noticed a smell, and although I do agree that it is hard to open, you get used to it and it's worth it!
B0095YYBPC|5|Get it!!! We got this in several sizes since it helped our son sleep.
B0041I4EPY|5|Really a good bean bag. Much bigger, thicker, and more substantial than my beanbags by Comfort Research. It's worth noting that this product takes a good amount of time to plump back up to size after packing and shipping, due to vacuum packing. I wasn't sure that it would, but it did. It's a good product. The shell is made of red denim. I'm pleased with that:)
B008JNV37E|5|I bought these brushes for the born free bottles.  They work great at keeping the bottles and all accessories clean.  Its a great product.
B004XN1KEA|5|Exactly what I wanted!!!  Timing was perfect.  Thank you
B00005QI1H|1|We bought one because it was so cute.  I still think it's cute. But that noise!  Our one month old actually fliched when we turned it on and off.  We returned it thinking it was defective and the new one did the same thing.  We called the manufacturer and held the phone up to the swing.  The representative agreed that is was loud, but indicated that all of their (Fisher Price) swings will make that noise.  It's cute, portable and the baby loves the lights, but we couldn't take the noise.  It had to go back.  We got bouncy seat instead.
B00BEVSSUI|5|This is a great cup for babies to learn to drink from a sippy cup and cups with straws. Great idea
B0040Z3YD6|5|I have used this everyday since i bought it (1 month) and LOVE IT! i especially love the cloth at the corners on the bottom. so convenient for those little drips of milk and even for the little spit up after the burp.<br /> when it gets dirty, i just pop it in the washing machine and its clean again :)<br />i also love that it has a piece of plastic on top that allows to see the baby. that was super helpful when i was just getting used to nursing and had to see if the baby was latching on correctly.  I also love that now i can always see her and she can see me :)<br />really cute design too! (chateau silver)<br />i want to buy another one :)
B00B40QOWI|5|These stickers are sooo cute, I am so glad that I found them. I wish I found them from her 1st month. The stickers go from 13 to 24 months. I wish it read 2 yrs old instead of 24 months but it's still super cute.
B0009ET49K|5|I love this brush.  I needed a brush for smaller medela breast pump bottles that wouldn't spray water everywhere when I pulled it out of the bottle.  This brush does that, and it's sturdy.  Definitely a good buy.
B00SZ5UGWO|2|Back side is not cottom which will irritate baby's skin,
B00FXPSDRY|5|We bring this spoon with us everywhere!  Love the little case, perfect for travel and as an easy addition to the diaper bag.
B0056Z2BTM|4|Very functional! I love having the two bags! One for each kid! Great for traveling. I use the small one for when I have just one of my children and use the big one when I have both!
B00NK3YSLG|5|Cute blanket, nice service
B00ATWVDCI|5|Smaller than I expected, but it is adorable and my granddaughter likes it!
B000J2Q5AS|4|perfect, practical, good stuff, just what we needed
B002Q0Y9VS|5|I used the basic Baby Bjorn carrier for three children, and liked it well. My main complaint was the plastic square in back that holds the two straps together. As the baby gets heavier, it is harder and harder to keep that plastic piece pulled down low on the back, and the higher it creeps, the more uncomfortable the carrier becomes.  Also, this was the piece that finally broke (after 6 kids, since I loaned it out to friends, also). So, for baby 4, I decided to upgrade to this Active model.<br /><br />Much improved! The lumbar support doesn't seem to take tons of weight, but I think it distributes it better. The cross-bar in back (above the lumbar support) stays put very well. Just being able to keep this cross-support lower on the back makes for a much more comfortable carrier. I also like the new reversible \\"button-clips\\" that snap on so easily for the top of the carrier.<br /><br />Downsides:<br />1)a bit warmer than the classic/original carrier. The extra strap around the waist (because of the lumbar support) feels a bit more constricting, but hasn't really bothered me. The more comfortable back/shoulders are a great trade-off for this.<br />2) takes just a bit longer than the classic to put on because two extra straps to adjust. But still very quick and easy to use.
B004J35KG8|5|I am so happy with this diaper bag. i was worried it wasnt going to be big enough and that i would need more space but its perfect.. more room than the picture shows! I'm so happy <3
B00KHBSU0E|3|My son is 2 months and could stare at this mobile for a long time without getting bored. He loves the song and the owls. Unfortunately, the wind up song (&#34;rock a bye baby&#34;) doesn't last very long. It lasts long enough for a diaper change or to get a onesie on him, but then you have to wind it up again. Knowing how much he loves mobiles and music, I would have gotten an electronic or battery operated mobile with longer songs.
B0013F7GKI|5|Amazon is the only place where I can find the refill for the Diaoper Dekor Plus pail.  I always find it at a great price and these bags always stand up even when filled to the max.  I have never had a diaper bag break.
B00AJSIVWW|4|This is a great booster if you want something basic and simple-to-use. My child, who is 6, can correctly install the booster in the car and buckle himself in. It lacks much cushioning in the seat, but he hasn't complained about any discomfort.
B00B7M7BKW|5|I didn't realized how much damage a car seat can do to your leather seat until a few days ago. I bought this after reading some reviews and I must say. I feel comfortable leaving car seat there all time. This is a must have
B004ZSZ04O|5|They come with a yellow &#34;card&#34; that I strongly recommend using. Everybody loves them and from pictures even think I painted them. But, most importantly, I love them :)
B008X6XRH6|2|We got this because our 2 year old is scared of the dark.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cute design that our child likes<br />Child likes to carry it around during the day<br />Plugs into the wall<br /><br />Cons:<br />Hard to turn the timer off and keep it on the base<br />The light wasn't bright enough to replace our standard plug into the wall night light... (therefore defeating the whole purpose of the purchase.....)<br />The changing lights are distracting at night and keep child awake.  It's hard to keep it set to one setting.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This product did not meet our expectations and we wasted our money.
B00PKP3J1W|5|Great stuff for serving homemade receipe puree to my 10 months baby, especially for going out with a stroller<br />I can provide a healthy snack for my baby
B004H2VXT4|5|I already have another model of Columbia diaper bag but this one is really great, the backpack is easy to carry and have more space for one or even two babies. Absolutely beautiful color!
B00LVMM72A|4|I Love this stroller. The only thing I do not like is the backs of the seats tend to lean towards the middle. I don't think it has enough support. Only held up by a one inch strap. I walk two babies (1 & 2 y.o.) and I seem to be adjusting the back support so they are not leaning so much into each other. Esp. when the little one fell asleep.
B0091538FO|5|Colores perfectos para baby boys. El diseño es netral para uso cuando y donde sea. Calidad, material y precio estupendos.
B00KVJ8DHM|5|Great product!! My friend loved it!! So affordable and came super quick in the mail!!
B00000DMCK|2|This toy is rated for 3 mos - 2 yrs. Well my son is 9 mos and has had this toy since he was 2 or 3 mos. It is hard so as far as durability goes, yes, it gets 5 stars but since the idea is that it is a child's rattle, it would have made more sense if it were padded.  My son has wacked himself in the head with it more than once. I rated only 2 stars for fun and education because he found the noise to be an interesting distraction if he was fussing and i needed to calm him during a diaper change but that was it. Before 6 months it was too bulky for him to handle and then we had the danger factor of him hitting himself by accident with it and truthfully by the time he could handle it a little more carefully, he lost interest. There are many smaller, safer rattles that are jut as noisy.  My recommendation is to pick one of those.
B000A1EN20|5|I gave this as a gift at a baby shower and the material is wonderful the embroidery is simple and classy.
B008YLCUOG|4|We like our carrier a lot, it makes doing chores around the house much easier since my little one doesn't like to be down all the time.  She is a little bit small for facing forward (not quite 4 months), but too curious to face in so it does rub her legs a little bit but I know as she grows more it will be great!  It is really easy to get her in and out of when I am alone which is really nice.  And I love the air flow since she gets very hot very easy.
B00063EDF4|3|I was looking for a cushin that was a little softer. This is a stiff cushin. Otherwise it's a nice size
B002SG7IXQ|5|We ordered one of these dolls for my baby girl because it was washable, the perfect size for her to hold, and there are no loose parts to fall off and become a choking hazard.  It's even cuter in person than it is on the computer.  Absolutely adorable and so very soft!  We're ordering another so we can wash this one without tears.
B00028XJNA|3|i use these and like them but i think they are a poor design if you want to reuse because they are hard to ziplock after being washed for some reason?
B00J0YTFD0|5|Received as a shower gift and they are by far my favorite swaddling blankets! The generous size makes them perfect for many uses. They are very breathable and relieve the worries that Baby might overheat. I would buy these over other more expensive brands any day.
B005VM63RQ|5|Let me just say before I begin that what I'm about to tell you is not how this stroller is \\"intended\\" to be used, but after my 4 yr old sitting on the tray of our single stroller, it is an improvement in safety.  We have two boys (2 and 4), our youngest has cerebral palsy, and we are expecting another baby in Dec.  We had the Graco Duoglider, but we loved it too much, and our wheels started to give out and the front shade broke off.  Turns out it was a blessing in disguise because this stroller is perfect for us.  We got a Chicco Keyfit 30 carseat for the new baby, and we originally thought we'd have to pay almost twice as much for the Chicco Cortina double stroller, but it turns out when we recline the front seat all the way back, it is a perfect and secure fit with our 2 yr old in the rear seat (note that there is no extra leg space beyond the carrier, though).  We love that our youngest son can sit close to us, and we don't have to worry about his lack of trunk strength since the seat is reclined and has lots of harness options.  Our 4 year old can hang on to the handle bar with his feet on the rear footrest and see his brother, which is awesome for both boys since it keeps the youngest entertained and the oldest is always jumping on and off anyway.  It is just as maneuverable and compact as the Duoglider, but so much more appropriate for our growing family!  We hope it lasts longer than our previous Graco stroller, but for the price, we won't be disappointed (or surprised) if it doesn't.  We love it!
B00068O22S|5|They are great and met all our expectations. By the time a child figures out how to open them, that child should've figured out that this - turning on the burners - is a no no.
B0000CED7M|5|These are my kids favorite night time cup! We changed the spout to the softer white ones, this is just a preference thing though. We only received purple and blue cups. Since I ordered 5 cups, more variety would have been nice. Great item!
B005GFY488|5|Cute!
B007V9AFSA|5|Have had for a year now. We love it. It is a solid piece and looks great. The crib has a fairly easy set up and the quality seems high.
B004EKQFMY|4|THis Bag is perfect for my cousin twins! Have blue, pink and other colors, she is very happy with it!
B005O2322W|4|some part is very diffcult stick on
B0018Z6910|1|Had it for 4 months my daughter loved it. She slept hours in it so hence I loved it. By the end of her forth month  I come to find her nearly hanging from the side of the swing. Literally seconds of walking in and out of the room. I'm so glad I didn't walk into her on the floor.   I then immediately called Fisher price to report this incident & they offered a full refund that I must wait 6 weeks to receive. They also said that although the product was ment for up to 25lbs ot was not ment for active babies with upper strenth. They stated that I had to use judgement. Uh ok so basically I need to wait for mu child to fall pff the seat to know when she is strong enough to fall off?   On top of this I have the inconvenience of sending. parts back to them. Spending time & gas.    Not worth the risk!
B00BFLKK8A|4|I like this because it doesn't look like a big canvas tent like most of the coverups.  It gets a bit hot under there though because it's mostly polyester.
B00D40VPDY|5|Beautiful! I love the way it looks! I bought as a gift for my first Grandson and my Son and Daughter in law are very excited and love it! They did alot of research before selecting it, so I hope that they get many years of happiness with it!
B004J34TF6|5|EXCELLENT
B008L4P24G|5|I loooove these! Great price and great quality. I especially love the more classic look of them being uncolored, fit perfectly with our pooh themed nursery :)!
B005KHYBEY|5|A gift for my granddaughter....great...everything I expected it to be...
B00J69XIZU|5|Perfect for our baby girl. The quality is great and the company goes above and beyond to provide a safe product.
B00HNYZ8DK|5|My daughter loved these!
B00AK533XQ|4|My baby has mild flat head syndrome so I started using this pillow at night and it has helped a lot along with more tummy time. I would recommend this pillow to others
B006ZSYIAE|5|It was a gift for a friend and she loved it. It was so soft and warm for baby girl
B003ZFLS08|2|We wanted the Piglet blankie shown by itself (pink with white blanket).  Our daughter is totally attached to that one and has been since early infancy (she's now almost 2).  We lost the back-up Piglet that we had when hiking at Lake Tahoe, so we ordered a second.  Unfortunately, we received the blanket shown with the baby in the second piglet (all pink with a different shaped head).  Our daughter can tell the difference, so when her &#34;good piglet&#34; is missing, she has a hard time with the all-pink &#34;back-up&#34; version.  I want to order a second piglet that matches the first (the one she likes) but I'm afraid to order because we might get the &#34;back-up&#34; version.
B00I2ND7IO|4|This is a beautiful crib. Very sturdy, as it has a little weight to it. Very easy to put together. Although, during assembly, I acquired a couple of small paint splinters. I wiped it down with a non-scratch pad to smooth it out. I wouldn't want the baby to get one of these small splinters, they hurt a wee bit. Otherwise it would be 5 stars.
B008NAAKJA|3|Clip is so hard to open when you need to move it/wash it, etc.!  Definitely won't slip off!
B000SJ5V8E|5|My son went from being under 7 lbs at birth to 17 lbs at 4 months. I should have been strength training to keep up with his growth, but luckily I had a Moby wrap. Even though I have a history of back problems, I can wear him for hours without any discomfort at all.   It did take me several attempts to get it wrapped correctly but once I got it, we were both thrilled. I wish I hadn't been intimidated by wraps when my daughter was small.   I have a pouch, an Ergo, a mei tai and have used ring slings and backpacks. The Moby is by far my favorite. It is comfortable in cold and warm weather, easily adjustable, and washable.
B0052DXIL8|5|My 3 year old granddaughter loves these blocks.  Great for learning how things fit together, colors and building.
B00CYM1I94|5|The best $25 I've spent on a baby item. It's so versatile which is why I bought it. It goes outside, to the bathroom (while my 2 yo potty trains) or just in the floor while I'm doing other things. My infant slept in it when he had reflux those first few weeks which was a blessing!
B000067K0L|3|My daughter loves this playmat, but she stopped liking it once she got the Tummy-time gym which has music and interactive toys.  So, I felt that it would have been cheaper to buy that toy instead, since it costs not even half as much!!
B00FOGCC9M|5|Beautiful necklace - perfect color and non-polished finish for a toddler boy.  Our son wears this every day and it looks great with his brown eyes.  I think it helps a little with his teething discomfort.  He likes to feel the beads with his little fingers and definitely likes wearing it.
B00AU6RHLO|5|Excellent, grandson loves it.
B0031M9EHE|2|We got this as a gift (after already having other playmats).  It looks kinda cute, but it's waaay too much bright pink for our tastes.  The materials seem cheap. We ended up donating this to a woman's shelter.   The singing bird that other reviewers have talked about was actually the best part of the whole playmat. We held on to the bird and hang it from our Fisher Price Precious Planet playmat.  Our bird's battery hasn't died yet...it's been about a month.  It plays fun music when baby pulls on it, and the bird is adorable.  The one nice feature about this playmat is that it folds easily and quickly (It just folds in half).  This is a nice feature, as you can easily pick up the playmat and move it from room to room.  However, i think it's only so portable because the activity bars are lighter and less sturdy than other playmats. Seems to me that a little bit older baby would have no problem pulling the activity gym down.  We didn't keep it long enough to find out.   I guess if you're looking for a cheaper option, it's okay, but if your baby really enjoys floor time (2 of our 3 kids did), I'd invest in a higher quality playmat like the Precious Planet Activity Gym.
B005PK1CCU|3|This fan is ok. The on off switch is way too accessible & easy to bump when picking up & accidentally leave it on without knowing it. 2 weeks into having it we have already changed batteries 3 times. My kid likes it though & I do like that it is kid safe if he is holding it. I will probably be looking elsewhere next time for a more efficient fan! This doesn't quite do the job. More of a toy for my kid than a good fan.
B001FBG8LS|5|Very nice quality.  It is a beautiful gift for our Godson!
B0052QYLUM|5|Got this on sale & it works great! I keep it next to me at night so I feel like baby is still in the room.
B00OZA1LAO|1|I did not get this puzzle-2 cheap ones<br />came, a train one, and a number one!
B001D7DYUC|1|Caution! This Item is a Preemie Size. Perhaps I am the only one who miss understood the size XX Small...There are three sizes available: Preemie, Newborn and Small. So I thought when they write small it should be the small one -On the package it is described with PREEMIE not XX Small! I had to call the customer service twice. First they did not want to give me a refund, they just wanted to send me the same size again.
B00198PQHY|5|This is a really nice little mobile and attaches/moves easily but is still sturdy. For our little one in particular the issue was she always wanted to get to the little animals... until it got to the point where she was tall enough to rip them off. Even 10 months after animal removal these little guys are still some of her favorites (especially the giraffe which we have to wash often as the feet seem to be the ultimate teethers for front, canines and molars). It has nice melodies and a very soft light if you choose that option. Battery life is middle of the road.
B00005BUMY|5|These r absolutely great.they r easy for my daughter to put in her mouth when she tries to feed herself and r easy to clean and store
B00272BD50|5|Amazing!!!!
B00208MJIQ|5|Before having my son I saw how my niece chewed up the rails of her crib. When I saw these I knew I had found just what I needed to prevent my little one from doing the same thing. My son is now over a year and we still have these on his crib. He usually chews on everything he can get into his mouth but these guards have kept his crib looking like new!
B001L983K8|5|this was on my baby registry but no one got it for me. so i got it for myself. we LOVE it. it has brought me so much joy. i mentioned to a friend how much i loved it, and she got me another one that i don't love as much as this one.
B001GQ2RV2|4|The mirror on this product falls off.  We had to reglue it.  The sticky is not sticky enough.     Other than that- it is great.  It is colorful, easy to take apart to wash.  My son and I use it all the time.
B004ECJWK4|2|The item is excellent. It functions exactly as described and holds the door firmly in place. However, the item broke the second time I used it. It's frustrating. Hopefully, this is isolated to only the item that I received.
B001RAFVGK|5|This is the only convertible carseat I've ever bought so I have nothing to compare it to but we are VERY pleased. We have it in keylime and are using it for our 14 month old. It is absolutely adorable. We bought it for the price and the looks - we have a large car. It is very sturdy as there is little chair movement once it is locked in place. My MAJOR concern is that my daughter could sleep in it and SLEEP SHE DOES! The side pieces on the headrest ensure she sleeps perfectly. Love this seat!!!
B001CWVYMI|5|Worked great. Sturdy, has a handle.
B006ZVV0P2|4|Protects the seats -covers them pretty well.  Wish there was a little more coverage at the top since that is where my toddler's feet hit right now.  Like that it has pockets for storage.
B0000E262S|5|I just had to write in and give praise to this product- It has saved my husband and I so many sleepless nights!  We first had our daughter in a bassinet(without the monitor)with us in our room but I found that I was constantly checking on her to make sure that she was still breathing-Yes I am a new mommy but none the less when we put her in her crib an used the monitor it was AMAZING! The peace of mind that it gave me hearing every movement she made with a reassuring tick to let me know that she was still breathing.   <br />I have never had any false alarms with this monitor like some have had I believe that if you follow the directions you won't have any problems. <br />As for the parental unit making a noise - just make sure you turn the main monitor off before picking up your child- it's not hard.   <br />We have had no problems with this unit- Trust me it is well worth the money!
B000056JMU|5|As expected
B004QZBEFU|5|I very much like these containers. They seal tightly, do not retain any color or smells, freeze well, and are sturdy. They also hold a very respectable amount of food. Even once I stop using them for baby food I will continue to use them in lunch boxes etc for snacks and such as they don't have a pattern or color that screams &#34;baby!&#34;
B00DWBMWCS|3|they are very thin
B000HBMVO0|4|I have 2 Peg Perego Strollers and the OEM cup holders are AWFUL - their either too small or so cheaply made that they break, so I opted for an addon cup holder. (It seemed like an easy task at first until I kept making trips back and forth trying/returning other brands).<br /><br />I eventually found this one. It's GREAT only b/c it's the only cup holder I've found that will attach to our stroller handles in a convenient location that doesn't hinder the stroller from collapsing. However it's a PAIN to put on - so once it's on, I will never take it off. Meeting the flap into the tiny hole and then trying to screw on the nut is time consuming. If only the flap was just 1/2 inch longer and same with the nut/screw it would be easy to install/take off.<br /><br />Why 4 stars? It works. It fits. And it's a giant size that I can put a water bottle or my son's sippy, or a big gulp w/o fear of it teetering out or spilling. It's also super durable. When we've flown with the stroller - it didn't break during gate check (unlike our other cup holders that either were smashed or cracked).<br /><br />I WOULD NOT recommend this for a thin handle stroller - you have to meet a min diameter in order for it to be stable - this seemed like it was made more for a jogging stroller instead of an umbrella type.
B000ETUFVQ|5|We are very happy with our purchase. We bought them primarily to protect the car seats from muddy shoes.  The pouches are an added advantage. Excellent price as well!
B00ICVFKPE|5|Looked exactly like the picture! Very fast delivery as well! I got it about three days later after I purchased the item without selecting any of the additional shipping methods. Love love love it! Would highly recommend.
B008X732PM|5|This rear seat is expensive but worth the money.  It makes my Joovy so much more comfortable for my toddler.  He was only 2 when my 2nd baby was born, and I wasn't ready to have him using the sit n stand seat as it was just yet.  This addition is great!
B0064V72G4|1|too big for daycare
B0052QYLUM|5|I love this monitor. I've had it for a year now. It's simple and easy to use with great night vision video. The battery also lasts for such a long time. I was so surprised that I only have to charge it once a week usually, for the amount I use it. It's also really durable since it does get tossed around sometimes by my boys. I have to say, this company has AMAZING customer service. I will recommend this monitor and company to all my friends and family.
B000XPS9MS|5|I really love that this is a really soft cover, I know it's nice on my son's skin. I love the Sage color!  It fits my Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad perfectly.  He's gotten some poo on it (projectile poo in not something people told me about!) but it hasn't stained so far which is awesome!
B004CLYZ3Q|5|great!!
B0009RG8R8|5|This gate is awesome - sturdy, well made, looks nice. Only suggestion i have, is to use screws to also attach it to your floor. The middle can move, but there's 2 plastic footer attachments that you can drill right thru to keep it even more sturdy - I love this gate.
B007FRJQ5G|4|Fits good. Very heavy. But the newborn side is too hard - like a piece of wood
B00L2MED0S|5|Bought this as a Christmas gift and me brother in law and sister love it.
B0071D1AKI|5|What a genius invention. Such a simple but effective product for toddlers.
B0009ET49K|1|Really don't know why it gets such high rate! The design is stupid leaving one side without bristle, so it takes at least twice as much  work as other brush to clean up bottles. The handled is so slippery and so difficult to grab on. Its tale is supposed to clean up nipples but completely fails.Water got splashed everywhere when I used it for the first time and got soaked up. I won't use it again. I like other products of Avent but definitely not this one. I wanted to give Zero star if it is a rate.
B005AYC45A|4|Fits six bottles.  Only complaint was wish it could fit three more.
B000066CMV|5|I tried the Gentle Expressions and Medela manual pump and got only a few drops, but this one worked really well. Its comfortable, and it seems that the cushy bell insert with the oval pocket was what helped the most. It created positive suction around the nipple. When the milk would stop, I just rotated that a little, and I would get more. Everyone's different, though, but I'd advise that you don't waste your money on the cheaper pumps.
B008R9F1S2|4|Got this for a teething 9 month old miserable baby.  She seemed to do better when wearing it for a length of time. I am a paranoid parent so I never let her sleep with it on, and I guess it's a good thing because one day I looked over at her and she had somehow leaned her chin down and got it inside her mouth and it was stuck like a gag.  Not really a problem as long as the child is supervised at all times.  I actually would try to put it on her when she wasn't really paying attention in the hopes that she wouldn't know it was on and that worked for most of the time.
B000F1MBQ0|5|I'm currently 22 weeks pregnant with my first baby. I suffered from previous back injuries in the past but it never fully recovered, so I started feeling slight back pains during the first trimester of pregnancy. I had trouble keeping on my left side when sleeping which led to more back pain. I tried using snoozers and pillows, but nothing seemed to work. We looked at the local maternity stores around but they only sold the C-shaped maternity pillows, and I figured they would be just the same as the snoozer at home. Originally, I was eyeing the Comfort-U Total Body Pillow Full Support Pillow CU9000 by Moonlight Slumber, but they wouldn't ship to Hong Kong, and I was slightly reluctant to pay $100 for a humongous body pillow that I would only use for a few months (although my hubby reassured me it would be worth the money). It was Chinese New Year and the shops in Hong Kong were closed, and I really needed the help, so I paid a little extra for priority mail and the snoogle loop pillow came in three days! I used it straight after I received it, but it did take me some time to get used to on the first night (I'm still not used to hugging something to sleep), but yes, the fact that it loops around the whole body, prevented me from sleeping on my back during the night, and the shape of the pillow ensured that my sleeping posture is correct. It also keeps my legs elevated so that I don't find myself having swollen feet in the morning. In fact, the snoogle loop pillow isn't as big as others said it was (it takes up less space than me hugging a snoozer and with pillows behind my back) - we have a Queen size bed and I don't even take up half the bed yet! It's very comfy and firm, except the inside curve where the head goes, the seams are sewed a little too tight, but I usually sleep a little further down so that's not much of a problem (and there's still lots of room for me and I'm 5'5\\"). Others have complained about the fabric being too rough on their skin, but I've had noissues with this despite having very sensitive skin. During the day, I fold the pillow up so it becomes like a cushioned chair and I lean into that when I'm reading or using the laptop. It's so comfy, I often find my hubby snuggling it during the night! The only downside is the part where the head goes and I find that it doesn't support my neck enough, leaving me with neck stiffness, but now I put a very thin pillow (it's actually the pillow I used when I was a baby) underneath the snoogle loop pillow and everything is fine now! I just wish they had nicer patterns for the case, as they currently only have ivory white, but I would say, it was definitely a good buy and very worth it.  PROS:  - Supports your back when you sleep on the side  - Keeps your body in correct sleeping position  - Keeps your feet elevated to allow blood flow  - Eases back + hip pain  - Comfortable and firm  - Can be used during the day as a rest chair  - Can be used post-pregnancy if suffering from back/hip pains  CONS:  - Slightly expensive  - Inside circle seam sewed too tightly, may dig into shoulders  - Insufficient head support  - No other pillow case patterns to choose from  I use this pillow every night now and I don't think I could sleep without it!! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO OTHERS!!!
B00UTZCHUW|1|Didn't Cling to window.
B00EL3THBA|5|Fit the crib perfectly, the quilt is beautiful and the bumper pads offer good protection for baby. A good buy.
B00LIRJ03W|5|I wash the jar, put 30g millet and pour into boiling water in it, then screw the lid. After about two hours, the millet completely braised.<br />Keep the most original nutrition of the millet, it is very convienent and saving time for me to prepare porridge, soup for my daughter. I'm going t buy another one and recommend this jar to my friend.
B00RFHM7V6|4|Arrived before the expected date. Looked exactly like the photo.
B009YSYCZS|4|It's really good, probably you don't need to buy the electric one.
B00ACA3ZLE|5|Adorable.  I Bought this as a shower gift.  My friend loved it!  Great quality and organic!  Def would buy again
B0098RFSJY|4|Really enjoy these beads.  I typically don't wear much jewelry because I am with my almost 10 month old and 3 year old all day everyday, but these Chewbeads are nice to wear any day to dress up an outfit but not worry about my little one chewing on.  Plus he's teething so much right now that everything goes in his mouth so it's nice to have them on and a go to for him.  I'd recommend them.
B000VUETF6|5|Very Happy with them. Will most likely order more. Thanks!
B000067K0L|5|Excellent for growing babies! Me & my baby love the glowing lights, music, dangling toys, and all the cool colors & activities for her to discover. It's also super duper easy to fold & put away or take with you for travel. This is probably the best thing I've bought my baby girl so far
B004K0RPB8|1|I am giving it one star because I was not able to use it. It may still be a decent product.<br /><br />I purchased two bassinets to go with my twin ion. One from amazon and one direct from valco. I received two bassinets that looked great but did not fit the twin ion. The paperwork said \\"twin ion bassinet\\" but the bag with the bassinet in it said \\"tri mode bassinet\\" These strollers have different parts but the bassinet looks the same. When I called to get a return number from amazons seller, the man on the phone said that they do not sell twin ion bassinets. He refused to give me a return number and I had to call back and get another person on the phone several times. The reason they refused to give a return number is because it had been over 30 days. I ordered the ion and bassinets at the same time. The bassinets arrived but the ion took over a month and I did not know they did not fit until it was too late to return.<br />By the time I straightened this all out the baby was too old for a bassinet. lol It was a bummer!<br /><br />I decided to do a review to let you know you should call and speak to someone directly before making this purchase. You might not get what you are ordering. Have your twin ion product number ready when you call. It will make it easier to match The bassinet to the stroller.
B002IWYXH4|4|I've had my diaper champ for a year.  And it was getting pretty icky due to some of the poop getting on the &#34;chute&#34; that puts the diaper in the bottom container.  I was about to throw it away and buy a new pail but decided to try to bleach it. Which brings me to my realization...How did I NOT know the entire pail breaks down into its parts and can be incredibly easily cleaned.  I took it apart and threw the parts in the bathtub with some bleach water and scrubbed it down.  It smells good as new and is clean.  I also ordered a new gasket from Baby Trend to replace the old gross gasket.
B006XHO7CG|1|I am sorry to say, but these swaddlers are not at all good. The Velcro is loud and cumbersome. It's a shame as the Swaddle Pods are brilliant. My babe becomes very irritated if I attempt to remove this for a middle of night changing.
B0038OLMXO|5|Got this to house my 5 dogs. I bought this and also 2 of the extensions so that I could keep the big dogs from the small dogs when away and overnight. It was really easy to assemble, looks great and after 5 months of a 100lb dog jumping on the edge is holding up really well. Easy to open with one hand and door will stay ajar which is a big plus for us.
B009Z4W140|5|My son can easily move this where it needs to be. It doesn't slip.
B00D6WFVDK|5|Great blankets. Similar to the ones that cost twice as month. One of these has even become our youngest &#34;blanky&#34;.
B00EVO7Z5Y|2|It is easy to put up but I noticed the other day it was starting to peal off the wall
B0052IERHM|1|Purchased June 18th and the top strap broke on our first trip. By August 1st, it was torn on the bottom. Not durable at all.
B00135S350|5|my daughter is 2 and in love with sesame street.... and of course elmo. so this was a perfect set of utensils for her. They are easy to hold and the fun characters make her want to use them as opposed to her fingers.
B013311R9K|3|this is little heavy for my baby.
B002VBXY6I|5|My 3 month old loves this octopus!!! We attached it to the bar on her playmat and she smiles at it, pulls all of the rings and loves the crinkling sound it makes. She grabs it with her hands and feet and it keeps her very occupied!!! Highly recommend.
B0000D9RQ2|2|The swing made my daughter sit way too upright.  She just didn't like it and it seemed to go too fast.
B0038JDUYI|4|This spoon is better than other that I have used since it is soft on my child's face (like a squeegee) and it helps to scoop all the baby food easily out of the dish. The handle is also long enough to get food out of jars without getting food on me!<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />  Easy to Use<br />  Sturdy Construction<br />  Washes Easily
B00UR02O1Q|5|Excellent
B003VZ8BXO|4|We like our Baby Trend stroller system.  Our son is now 2 years old, and have been using it since his birth.  I like how easy it is to collapse the stroller and the ease of moving since the front wheel pivots all different ways.<br />The only two complaints I have is the stroller is pretty heavy and the seat recline adjustment strap doesn't work properly on ours and continually loosening and the seat reclines.
B0092NNQ98|3|We are okay with this product. I think the Bumbo's cost more than they are used.
B00208S1T2|5|does the job
B009585IJ6|5|I bought this rattle for my granddaughter who will be 4 months this week. She loves it. She gets so excited watching it and will also calm if you use it slowly. It was a great buy and I recommend it for gifts.
B001EU8IPY|4|This is a nice set, it has served us well. I haven't tried the storage bags yet, but love the 2.5 ounce containers. They are perfect for my output right now (and seeing a full container come off the pump is a morale booster in the early months). The nipples were a bit fast flowing for my newborn at first. We used dr. Brown's premie nipples instead which fit well enough, but not perfect, and kept him from sucking down a bottle in minutes or chocking and spitting up milk. The nipples that come with this set are prone to collapse, but we have found if you don't over tighten them they work better.
B007X5QMUM|5|Whiledecorating my newborn's room I cam across these pictures and I had tohave them. His room his red, blue and a touch or black. The pictures are vry good quality and the price was very very reasonable. I compared the price to Ebay and Amazon was cheaper.
B000A8LPB0|5|The Swaddle Designs blanket was one of the best gifts I received. The pictures of how to swaddle a baby on the sewn in tag was so helpful to me. The nurses showed me how to swaddle at the hospital but I couldn't remember how to do it when I got home. My best friend came to visit me and brought me this blanket. I realized the small rectangular blankets that I was trying to use were just too small and this blanket is much bigger and showed me how to make a swaddle that stayed secure. It was easy to follow the steps and after a few times my confidence grew and I was swaddling like a nurse! My husband found the tag helpful, too. I bought 2 more because otherwise I was doing wash all the time. My baby is 6 months old now and I no longer swaddle him but I have used this blanket for everything from a tummy time mat, a cover up while nursing, a changing pad, extra padding to prop his head in the carseat, and I take it everywhere. I buy Swaddle Designs' blankets for my friends now as gifts. I am very happy with the quality. I haven't found a softer big blanket, and I love the sweet stitching. It is an essential I still use daily.
B002UD661C|5|I have an arms reach cosleeper. I bought a couple of these to use as a mattress protector and they worked great. Now that she is 9 months and in a crib, I use them as changing pads. Great price and great quality. I definitely recommend.
B009JVYQ6K|5|The only pacifier my baby will accept.
B00BGY94T2|4|We had to decide between this and the Ergo. The Ergo came with high reviews from friends, but it doesn't have the option to forward face, which ultimately became our deciding point. This was an unknown product for us, but had seen great reviews of it. We also wanted a color that would work not only for a little boy, but for his dad. This one was perfect.<br /><br />First of all, a baby carrier is a MUST. And get one with hip support, you won't want to carry your 15+ pound baby on just your shoulders for more than a few minutes, trust me. We did try a Moby wrap that was given to us, but hated it. It just was to complicated, and too snug. Our LO hated being swaddled, so the Moby just wasn't for him. I think we would have liked the Ergo, we see them everywhere, but the fact you cant forward face ruined it.<br />This one is very versatile. so far we have used the front carry facing us, and facing out, but haven't used the back carry position yet at 5 months.<br />Solid construction, and this model seems to hold it's color during washes just fine. Our LO loves being close to us while we do our normal daily activities and now that he has head control won't face us, he always wants to face forward. He LOVES looking forward as we do things. Which, completely removes any doubt whether or not we bought the right one.<br /><br />A few things we don't like:<br />The clips....they suck. I understand why, but they still suck. Why do I HAVE to use two hands to remove this? I have my baby in one hand!<br />It's hot. Durable is good....but this is so nice and thick it gets hot in the summer. Yes you will sweat with this on. A summer baby is hard enough. I would love a thinner material. It's perfect for colder temperatures.<br />Lastly....its stupid expensive for a product that you won't use THAT long. I would have given this five stars except for that and the clips.
B009IVQ3N0|1|didn't fit my toilet seat. i bought the one for the elongated toilet seat (which i have) but the part that goes on the bolts to attach it was not compatible with my toilet seat. not so universal.
B0047T68WE|3|While the product was great, one of the two zippers that you use to get into the main compartment was missing!! If I am paying this kind of money for a diaper bag, I expect to have all of the parts.
B00GP3407U|4|It was a bit tricky to get on, even for an avid bike rider, but it fit my needs and my daughter's stroller needs perfectly.  Thanks!
B0097ZFMS4|5|So soft!
B0006FHB9C|5|I can't complain, these things have saved us so many sleepless nights because of a gassy baby! My first child had a major problem with gas because of the formula he was on, we tried so many different bottles and systems until we came across these. What a lifesaver! The Dr. Brown's bottles do a great job at keeping gas out of baby's stomach but these liners do an even better job! I must say though that I do miss the old design and the expandable liners, I don't know why they changed it but the new design still gets the job done. Now, with our second child these liners are still trumping any bottle feeding system out there. Don't buy the cheaper store brands if you really want your baby gas free, we have tried that and there's a huge difference in them! Will definitely be using these again if we have a 3rd!
B00FZLWA5W|2|The Hippo bib style looks exactly like the Dex Dura brand and that was what I thought I was buying. These bibs stain easily and do not clean easily. I wish I had looked closer to the description and bought the Dex Dura brand.
B00005C2IT|2|I love how it looks, but now too small for my 10 month old.  Only 2 1-oz cubes of baby food fit in each compartment.  Also, the lid is very hard to take off.  You have to be very careful not to spill the food because it takes lots of pulling to take the lid off.  The spoon is easy to use.  I will not recommend this lunch box, but will buy more spoons.
B009WUPGQC|3|I purchased mine directly from their website and I loved these pouches, they are so convenient and allow you to make your own smoothies, purees and other yummy squeezy snacks for an infant, toddler or older child. I love Everything about these pouches except that the \\"zipper\\" closure detaches from the pouch After just a few uses and that renders the pouch totally useless. I have contacted the manufacturer and I Hope they replace them for free.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />After contacting them, they did send me a new pack of 4 at no cost. They were very nice and accommodating, however the same thing happened with the pouches they sent. They just do not last very long. And its a shame because otherwise these pouches are awesome
B005MATOM8|5|Works like a charm to keep my son warm and snug. He really loves it! Delivered in a timely fashion!
B0038JE63W|5|For a small item, this is very sturdy and works just fine.
B001GQ2PAA|5|We have a 2 and 1 year-old and were looking for a side-by-side stroller for the zoo. Neither one liked to sit in the back of our previous stroller because they couldn't see very well. We ended up loving this stroller so much, we never use our other tandem stroller and plan to to give it away or sell it. This stroller folds down pretty small and we constantly travel with it in the back of our minivan. We don't go anywhere without it! The only thing I dislike about it is that the canopies don't fold down very far so the sun still blinds them when we are walking in the direction of the sun; otherwise, this stroller is perfect for us and we absolutely love it!
B00522W6SA|3|I liked the lamp shade. Had a little difficulty fitting it to a lamp. I bought and returned several since the shade sat too low on the lamp itself. I was disappointed with the packaging and shipping as my shade came with a dent in it that thankfully popped out with lasting damage.
B002NG6TV8|3|The color of the cover is more like a grey than a true white.  Just not what we expected. The cover works fine otherwise.
B00LXIYMMK|5|Love it! It's provided some great relief for my little guy, as well as a great distraction from tugging on mommy :). It's perfect. It's cute, too!
B00AQ7BIGW|5|love it
B004FPYFWA|4|I like this diaper bag. Although it is amazing how fast it fills up, and I already think I need a bigger one. I can fit diapers, wipes, outfits, nipple cream, butt balm, nursing cover, travel bottle warmer, wet/dry bag, and a few toys in here and still get it zipped. It is easily wiped down in case of spills and the changing pad that comes with is very handy. Multiple straps and pockets make it easily customizable for any family.
B004HO5870|5|I've been meaning to write and tell how very satisfied with the Jeep Wrangler Twin Stroller that my girls and I are.  I have a 3 (to be 4 soon) and a 15-month old.  We have to park some distance from our apartment so it's a little rough on the little ones.  Now they both get to ride in style.  Every morning we set the stroller up and off we go.  It's great.  It fits through the elevator and most other doors I've come up against.  The reclining back is great too because if the kids fall asleep in the car coming home at night or are still sleeping in the morning, they like laying back.  The only two negative things (if you want to call it that) about the stroller are 1) it takes awhile to put together (at least for a mechanically challenged person like me) and 2) the way the reclining back attaches to change positions.  Sometimes when setting the seat to an upright position, one side will come loose.  But that is very minor compared with all of the pluses.  It's well worth the money.
B001DVR25G|4|Beautiful piece of furniture, but my toddler grabbed a drawer on the side and tried to climb up to see in her drawer, and it bent the sliding rods. My husband had to man handle it so it would go back in the dresser. Other than that it's great- fits much more than the set I bought at R2G, and less expensive.
B00005QI1H|4|My 2 month old twin girls LOVE their swings!  I have 2 of them, and they are both quiter than any large swing I have been around.  I love the fact that I can take them from room to room with me, and to Grandma's house, too!<br />The only reason the swing gets 4 stars instead of five from me is that my girls tend to fall to one side a bit.  I wish there were some kind of head support like what is in an infant car seat.  I have improvised with rolled up receiving blankets, and that seems to work well.<br />The swings are prefect for twins since they don't tkae up too much space, are light and affordable, and can travel with you.  I HIGHLY reccommend this product!
B002968T5G|5|My daughter was born premature.  We've been so stressed, I'm trying to pump with this double breast pump and two hands tied up while trying to use the death trap pump.  Holding one breast while attempting to adjust the other. Sitting hunched for a half an hour at a time.  This has helped me tremendously.  Its comfortable too. Love it!!!
B000CNMUQC|5|I have used this for all 3 of my girls. It fits on the toilet great. They can put it on and off by themselves. Wipes down easily with a wipe (baby or clorax). It is nice and cushy, and has a nice comfortable contour.
B0043D28B4|5|Nice and crinkly for infants and fun for them to hold (and try to eat).  Your kiddo will love it!
B000G7TIZA|5|I like this, it's lightweight and easy to move around as needed, and also very sturdy.  We use it on the changing table and on the floor in the bathroom during bath time.  It provides a comfy safe place to do diaper changes, clothes changes, and lay baby down while toweling her dry.
B0016L0MMS|5|Essential purchase for any potty training toddler.
B00IJEFRPC|1|One of the bags ripped up after a couple of washes.  The second is on the verge of ripping apart.  The magnets in the bag are rusting through the material.  They definitely do not hold up.
B00DC3A1FG|5|First off, this thing is awesome.  I do feel a bit weird taking my child for a walk just like my dog, but man this thing has saved my arms, and sanity.  This keeps the child running around, but never out of reach.  It looks neat and I get many &#34;Awwwws&#34; from other people.
B0000DEW91|1|This gate would be great--if it worked. Unfortunately it does not automatically latch as claimed. I walked through the gate and had assumed it latched until I heard my baby whining at the top of the stairs! The company said that it must be faulty and would replace it, but I am still waiting for the replacement over a year later.
B000067EH7|3|This tub worked well for the first 4 months. Our son was 5 weeks early but we only used the hammock for the first bath - it just didn't appear to be sturdy enough. The recline position allowed our son to splash and have fun in the bath but he seemed uncomfortable where his bottom rested against the raised plastic area meant to keep baby in position. Since he was still too young to sit upright but obviously uncomfortable on the recline side we retired this tub and moved to a bath tub cushion which works great. <br /> <br />If I could go back in time I don't think I would purchase this tub again, but there was nothing wrong with the product itself.
B0030EH8OO|5|After a few weeks of searching for the lightweight stroller that I needed for my son, I finally found the perfect one which I had yesterday, thanks to Amazon's fast shipping and great service. I used to have the bulky travel system and my son who's 10 mos.old needed the transition already. The reviews here helped me make that decision so I'm making mine as well hoping to help that next buyer out there. First, let me state that this stroller has everything that a full-size stroller has for less money. It's a no brainer actually. I was choosing between the Jeep Stroller which is also in the same price range, and an excellent used condition jeep jogging stroller with the same price as well. I had to choose this simply because it's lightweight, easy to maneuver, has a 5-pt harness, child tray, parent cup, and a huge basket, and may I say, very stylish. The jeep stroller doesn't have the 5-pt harness. The jogging stroller is very heavy at 28lbs, so no way. The downsides are it's cheap looking when you look at it really close, and I don't think it has enough padding, so I had to put a headrest.  And it's not really compact when it's folded. For the price, those were little concerns for me. And my son seems to be enjoying it as well.
B00KMO5IOW|5|This was pretty easy to put together. My teenager helped me and we got it together quickly. I like the subtle pink color. It is definitely pink without being too loud or bright. It looks great in the nursery and seems to be sturdy
B0035HS4YO|5|I don't know what it is about this thing, but my 10 month old girl has fallen in love with it! At first I was dissapointed because when it arrived I realized it was different than the pink poodle pictured (nose shape) but it was still so cute and she LOVES playing with the ears and little corners of the blankey when she is drinking her bottle. And when I put her in the crib for sleeping she HAS to be grabbing this with one hand, it is so cute.  Definately buy at least 2 of the same if you notice your baby getting attached to it - sooner or later one will get dirty and the other one can be used until the original is washed OR else use the 2nd one for travel.[[ASIN:B001B4Z8C4 Angel Dear - Pink Poodle Snuggle Friend Blanket]]
B00AWLZD3Q|1|It's simple - if you use any bottles that aren't wide mouth (AKA any bottles best for breast-feeding babies) then this is not the brush for you. I unfortunately found this out the hard way, as it was impossible to get into the bottle. I tried using it as a brush for other dishes, to feel like I hadn't completely wasted my money, but the microfiber pads get disgusting and look bacteria-filled within the first few uses. I put it in the dishwasher to clean, and it still didn't look clean enough for future uses, so I tossed it. I'm back to a Munchkin brand bottle brush and love it.
B0038JDV8S|5|After using the brushes with foam cris-crossed at the top and breaking 1-2 a week, I bought this brush. AMAZING.  It fits all the bottles I use.  I still prefer the detached nipple scrubber, but it is nice that this one has one in the handle so you don't misplace it. Will be giving this brush as a gift to new mom friends!
B001DVRTEA|5|These are a great and inexpensive way to secure baby's toys and other things to a stroller, carseat, shopping cart cover and high chair.  My 8 month old grandson LOVES to throw his toys off of his high chair tray, so I decided to attach his toys using these.  He's still tossing toys off his tray, but now I'm not constantly having to pick them up and wash them over and over.
B00GDL7IB4|5|I love this brand of diapers. I have been getting them for a while now. My daughter broke out from other diapers, thought she just needed to get used to wearing them when she was born. She is three months old now and still gets a rash when I put her in other brands. The pattern is very fun to.
