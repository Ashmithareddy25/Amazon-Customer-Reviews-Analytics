B0065GC0BA|5.0|Beautifully written.  simply couldn't put it down.  I had recently returned from a trip to Grindelwald and the Marais area of Paris when I read this superb book and Jojo Moyes describes both places with such accuracy that I thought I was back there.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It seamlessly copied a book from my laptop to my cellphone.  That and it is easy to navigate/use its features.
1582701709|4.0|Great read! Really inspiring, can't wait to read it again! Recommend to anyone needing change in their lives right now
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I'm new to this show, I'm currently in the middle of season 2 and all I can say say is \\"ITS AMAZING\\", I'm kind of mad it took me soooo long 2 get into this show but then again better late than never. I thought Breaking Bad was the most amazing show I had ever seen on TV, but then G.O.T. Came along. Now don't get me wrong Breaking Bad is still my fav show of all time but that's only because G.O.T. Hasn't ended yet 4 me 2 make a decision on which 1 I prefer, but so far I put it up there with B.B.<br /><br />IF u haven't seen this great piece of work I suggest u start watching it, like many ppl have said u have 2 b patient 4 the story 2 unfold but 1nce things get going u will not b disappointed.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|I love Ariana. Her style, her personality, and her music. I got this the day it came out. I think you'll love this if your an Arionator!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great alarm clock! Lots of options, you can set multiple alarms, and also volume of alarm.  In all a good choice in alarm clock apps!
B00C7607FS|5.0|My wife and three year old love this movie. This is probably her favorite Disney movie of all time. Disney knows what they are doing when it comes to making movies.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This app is amazing. My husband always wanted a little home weather station. Well, this is even better as we travel, and it keeps us updated. The pictures are fun and  lovely (easily amused, some say), and there are even seasonal surprises. Worth every little penny.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Love, love, love this game, very challenging and addictive.  Purchased Part 1 and was glad to see Part 2, looking forward to Part 3.  Never had a problem with it locking up until today but I still enjoy it overall.  If you like match 3 games you will enjoy this one.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I had this on LP years ago and sold my record collection so I wanted to buy a copy on CD.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|While I've always loved AF, it seems half their stuff is so annoying that I skip it. Not on Reflektor, though. After 5-6 listens, it's all good, and I suspect their popularity will grow with this one.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|I had this on LP years ago and sold my record collection so I wanted to buy a copy on CD.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|From the time I saw the first commercial I was hooked and couldn't wait to see this film and I'm not a big on Zombies kind of guy, had to wait for it to be released (wheelchair bound and don't like to go out) and felt the film was missing something...I didn't feel for the cast...not bad if you can get it on sale for under $9.99 but not worth the $20 I spent
B003YNFYD8|5.0|I had this on LP years ago and sold my record collection so I wanted to buy a copy on CD.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I was SHOCKED!!! as someone who is a huge Star Trek fan I had mixed feelings for the first remake as JJ changed a little too much and I had to give it a balanced review, IF I had never seen a Star Trek anything I would have given the film 5 stars, but I had issues with some changes he made...anyway that's not what we're here to talk about...When I found out (SPOILER ALERT!!!!) that this film had KHAN I said &#34;Oh no...has Paramount LOST their mind by letting JJ mess with the best Star Trek film EVER&#34; so I waited and everyone stayed quiet and didn't talk to me about it. Sooooooo it finally comes out on Blu-Ray and I'm ready to tear the film apart...well it didn't work out like that, the cast has really come together and play their parts well (Karl Urban is PERFECT as Dr. McCoy) the film had a nice pace and the fact that they just FLIPPED the Wraith of Khan script was a surprise and by the end of the film I was in tears just like the firs time I saw Wraith of Khan. not wanting to give the film away for someone who has not seen it, great casting and the copy was perfect, I've gotten over most of the changes JJ has made, and excepted the fact that this is set in an alternate reality as the original series and they reference that in the film helps us old timers adjust...at the end of the day all I can say is BRAVO!!!
B000002OVJ|5.0|I had this on LP years ago and sold my record collection so I wanted to buy a copy on CD.
B00C7607BC|5.0|Of all the Disney movies this is my #1, it has it all and I've owned it on VHS, Laser Disc( which looked better than the DVD copy) and now on Blu-Ray. It's clean, crisp, sharp and over all a great film for everyone and this was the Disney film that got everyone back into animation...Bravo and I now hope we can get a break from changing technology...I think Blu-Ray will be my last upgrade I still use my laser disc player and this copy(Blu-ray) in comparisons makes my laser copy look like I watching VHS...this is a MUST own
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|It wasn't as good as the original Judge Dredd. Got a kick out of how the main character always looked pissed off. Thought the scenery was pretty good, but the movie was too long.
B00F8OUBXE|3.0|this maybe one of the better cd they put out  since human factor with mike howe but master piece with daid wayne was not a master piece to me but a good cd not in the same realm as his early M.C cd& dark master pieces and  when howe replaced him with Blessing  and there best since the first two human factor their career has been a disappointing cd after more disappointing cd since hanging in the balance. this one sound like they wanted old school thrash but don't remember it because master pieces was a great line-up but less than grand sounding effort but it had some ok stuff on it but the live 86 cd double set I bought is why I keep It still  because that live cd kills that what they will be know by and are known by now-old school fan live the first two and some lke the first 4 like me but they only have 5-6 worth remembering even david waynes solo cd before master piece was pretty good but I can't remember one song but sadly I remember how great no friend of mine was live on tour with metallica 2 years before they eventually ruined it on cd.this one should have been (nail # _ in the coffin) because no one will remember it in 6 months like the last 8?.
B007CKNX28|5.0|This is an excellent example of Jack White's versatility.  It has something for the young, the old, and the in between.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|what a great idea for a game after a great movie I love this at my age nice feature is the interaction and its easy to keep going not diffecult
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|I think that this game lends a fun twist to the match three (3) game category with enough of a challenge to keep it interesting.
1401233384|5.0|I liked basically everything about this read.  It takes place in a fun, semi-alternate universe, and spotlights The Flash (a main component in past Crisis-like stories).  This twist on Batman was very interesting, and as far as I know, hadn't bee done before (again, as far as I know).  Overall, I was left really wanting to read more from the Flashpoint universe.  I even liked how the end of the story [SPOILERS AHEAD] subtly moved us, as readers, into The New 52 universe.  One thing of note, and a possibly scary implication, is that [SPOILERS AHEAD] Aquaman and Wonder Woman are shown to have a very dark side.  Although this universe is slightly different from the main universe, the two only have about 20 years of alternate history that separates them.  This story shows that even our Aquaman and Wonder Woman are both capable of some heinous actions.<br /><br />Not too long, not too short.  Flashpoint was just right.
B00EGMHKBA|5.0|I loved Eggers' first book, A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, and I think I enjoyed this just as much. The idea of what might come once there is a company that buys Facebook, and who has a cultish philosophy wrapped in altruism is a great setting to make us put a mirror up to ourselves and our habits. Highly recommend.
0307913090|5.0|“We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love.  That is a great glory, and our great tragedy.” - Maester Aemon<br /><br />Amazing world-building.  Outstanding character development.  Wonderful story-telling.  These are the things you will find in The Game of Thrones.  I was first introduced to this book by the HBO series, Game of Thrones.  If you are able to get beyond the R-Rated material in the TV show, the political intrigue in this story about the battle to rule the realm is very well told.  Unfortunately, I couldn’t support the graphic imagery of the HBO series, so I turned to the books in order to see what happens next with these characters.  In order to get re-immersed in the story, and also because books often have additional material that adaptations are forced to exclude, I began with Book #1 of A Song of Ice and Fire.  The TV show actually stuck quite close to the book.  I don’t feel that any important story elements were left out.  Nevertheless, it was good for me to re-acquaint myself with these characters and all the action that was happening as Season 1 of the TV series came to an end.  The books style of telling the story from multiple characters’ points of view works very well as the story takes place in various locations within the vast Westeros.  My favorite characters were Ned, Jon Snow, Daenerys, and (especially) Tyrion.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|While I understand some people's disappointment with the ending of the novel (and the series), I actually think it was fitting. The rest of the novel was on par with the first two books in my opinion. The only thing I didn't think was plausible is the explanation for why the city of Chicago exists in its \\"current\\" form. I you enjoyed the other two books, I'd ignore the naysayers and give this a try.
B00D8CSVLW|4.0|There's nothing new in the way this plot unfolds. A lawyer whose best days may be behind him, a suicide, a handwritten will, loyal black servants versus avaricious family members.<br /><br />The author's skill lies in wrapping up this parcel in prose that will keep you involved through to the very end. In fact I found the denouement slightly anti-climactic, but the book is still eminently readable.<br /><br />Grisham's strength is in making the characters believable, although a trifle cliched in parts. Pickup trucks, rednecks and mistreated African-Americans do not make a new genre.<br /><br />However, Grisham's readers are not looking for that. They want an interesting story well told.<br /><br />And that's what they will get in &#34;Sycamore Row&#34;.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Good movie good adventure story good special effects actors ok monsters could have been a little more realistic but good over all
B003F44QRQ|5.0|When I was 13 this was at the Base theatre on Beale AFB, I had to sneak in but this has been my favorite vampire movie since that day.
0425252868|4.0|I wasn't sure I would be able to get into this book, which is about a German fighter pilot during WWII, aka:  \\"the bad guys\\".  Yet, I found his story compelling, and quite sad at the end when he went public with his story and how he was received.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game was great fun.  Makes you think but in a fun way.  Looking forward to more levels or similar. games.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was better than the first! I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the final book. I'm really sad that it's going to be over and I just hope I'm not disappointed!!
B002NZV68U|4.0|I love the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory movie and I love Tim Burton movies. I know a lot of people are put off by the whimsical original scenes of the first movie, like the umpa lumpa songs, but did you really expect Tim Burton to create a photocopy of the original. If anything certain components of the story line are much closer to the original Roald Dahl book. If you're looking for a fantastical good time, watch this movie!
B00013M6NK|5.0|The battery is original and it works great , maybe because is new i don't know but it still working good is much better thank original old one ,.<br />I Would recommend this product
B002ONIST6|5.0|Terrific movie. Incredible cast. I am surprised I hadn't seen sooner. Not your typical gangster movie. Intering how this movie was &#34;based&#34; on fact - added to the enjoyment factor.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|Exactly how I wanted  the music to be. I can picture the scenes as I listen to the songs. Great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and addictive. Love to sit and play anywhere i am. Like to try and beat my facebook friends at the game.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|I've read it years ago and now I just wanted with me on my iPad.<br />A book that you cannot miss!
B0026HKO2E|3.0|Obviously not as good as the first movie, but much more non stop action. I was not surprised they dragged this out to another film, part three.
B00170GXQ2|5.0|Even though Hollywood strayed away from the book (a lot) I still LOVED the movie. I liked this version better then any other..
B00F880BWG|3.0|This season is getting off to a slow start but hopefully will pick up steam soon. It may be hard to keep up the same level as last season.
B008OM0EDO|3.0|Typical Sacha Baron humor. It had it's moments. Wish there were more unrehearsed/live reaction takes like in Borat or Bruno.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been watching and waiting to play on my tablet!Thanks Kindle for adding this app! A simple yet challenging game,great for all ages (I'm a grandma) great way to pass time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|finally amazon got candy crush saga. it is really addicting .I have been waiting for forever for amazon to have it and I finally gave about a month ago and I was just looking at the top free games and I was so happy when I saw it right away
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Well the game is fun but super easy sometimes it's hard to get stars and it requires a certain amount of starts to get to the next set of levels which I think is really stupid cuz if your a child you wouldn't be able to understand very well what meaning and you would get frustrated
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|While I was glad to finish reading the trilogy, it seemed like the ending was rushed to conclusion.  I was a little disappointed at the end.<br />...The possibility of Gale's role in Prim's death was very disappointing since all along he was watching over Katniss' family while she was gone.  Maybe this was meant to lead Katniss to her choice between Gale and Peeta.<br />...Katniss' choice between Gale and Peeta seemed very rushed to conclusion with it seeming to happen behind the scenes and the reader just getting the result.  I would have liked a little more interaction on the subject.<br />But even with a few disappointing points, it was still a very good read and I enjoyed it.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This movie was great! I showed it to my class at school and they loved it! Great family friendly movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and addicting.  Love it!  You will love it, scream at it, hate it, then love it all over again.  This is the game you love and hate all at the same time.
1451673442|5.0|I read The Secret and this is much more because of the practical application to principles. All I can say is I went through this book diligently and I was amazed at how life became so much easier -- by being grateful.
0547581033|5.0|My new favorite for one year old birthdays.  The story is endearing and an introduction to the whole world is one big family.
B000SZH7RQ|5.0|One of the best boogie albums ever. Hooker and Canned Heat do a great job of highlighting Hooker's talent on this album.
B0033QC0WE|5.0|Heard this on NPR on afternoon and knew I had to have it.  I keep it permanently loaded in my car.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I didnt now I would like this game. It's cute some levels r difficult cause u can't see the whole board and if u try to shoot the bombs they don't launch right but other wise enjoy the game. Like the bonus levels as well oh and if u get refill amo as soon as that level is over you can't keep the amo but u paid for it why is that it should carry over level to level unroll u used it all.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|you gotta play this game . It is better than good for free. asy to play tutorials. I give it five star story it s graphics alone
B006M4F67A|4.0|This is a fun game with a variety of shapes to play.  Even showed my Mom (over 80) what I was playing.  She was interested in the game, but doesn't have a Kindle.  She will find it on her computer.  I enjoy this game though crashing once in awhile.
B00BT70J6S|5.0|Hearing his performances live was irreplaceable, and now that he belongs to the ages, this is the next best thing.  People who live after the time of Horowitz need to hera as much of him as possible. A young man I know believes a current young artist, an outstanding one, plays the Rachmaninoff Third better than anybody else.  He doesn't realize that without Horowitz's association with this piece and with its composer, the quality of current performances of it would not be possible.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is too good to be free. When you start you can't stop. It has very much advanced from it's original Reel Steel app from the beginning. Like I said, very addicting, get it now for free.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works great on my lg optimus g. Definitely keeps my apps backed up and frees up spare room on my phone when need too.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Love the dialog. Funny and a bit chessy a guilty pleasure to watch. Great eye candy! If you like campy law drama this is one to watch.
B00DY9X3JO|5.0|It's not too often that I purchase something that is playing on rotation over the CD shop PA system, without knowing anything about its contents,  but that is what happened when I heard this permeating the store.  Dianne Reeves has had a plethora of great recordings ranging from jazz, soul to international music, and this is an added achievement. Terri Lynn Carrington produced this album, and her taste and influence expands, luckily for us.  Reeves' cover of Fleetwood Mac's &#34;Dreams, Bob Marley's &#34;Waiting in Vain&#34;, and that chestnut &#34;Stormy Weather&#34; are among the highlights - she breathes new life into these songs.  (Haven't you heard great songs, that you wonder if they would sound even better, if they were interpreted differently, by a more capable singer?)  &#34;Tango&#34; provides a bit of Latin flavor.  Stellar support is provided by Gerald Clayton, Robert Glaspar, Esperanza Spalding, Richard Bona, Gregory Porter, Lilah Hathaway, and the late, great George Duke - 'nuff said!  Those who love jazz, soul, and vocals should not miss this.
B00G32TD98|5.0|Scary and thrilling but not gratuitously explicit. Edge-of-your-seat suspense! Definitely intense enough to get the R rating. Reminiscent of Amityville and Exorcist.
B00701QVVY|4.0|I like it but is not a master piece. I´m still specting an album like horrorscope or the years of decay.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|There are not very many movies that have sequels that were good or better than the first, and this one of them. I truly enjoyed the movie and if the ever was to have a third install i hope its as good as the previous two.
1476712042|5.0|I've loved the story , his side versos her side, I've loved reading it and i think its amazing to read his side and understand better the characters
B001RIY4WE|1.0|Be warned: The reviews on this page praising the plethora of behind-the-scenes featurettes refer to out-of-print DVD editions, NOT the single-disc Blu-Ray you see on this page.<br /><br />The Skynet Blu-ray contains NONE of the many documentaries and behind-the-scenes features found on previous T2 releases.  For those, you will have to seek out an old standard-definition DVD release.  This Blu-ray contains only the \\"Special Edition\\" director's cut and two commentary tracks (1993 & 2003).  Besides that, the menus are annoying and painfully slow to load.<br /><br />The picture quality is adequate but substandard for a Blu-ray release, probably owing to excessive grain reduction and the fact that the theatrical aspect ratio was created from a \\"soft crop\\" of the taller 35mm negative.  Fans of the old DVD and Laserdisc special features recall a one-of-a-kind demonstration of how the pan-and-scan (4:3) home video crop included more vertical picture (but slightly less width) than the theatrical crop.  This was common filming practice during the VHS era.  One would have hoped the Blu-ray transfer to restore the lost height, instead of replacing it with rasterized black bars and 25% wasted resolution (turning 1920x1080 into 1920x816), but no such luck.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Cute characters with fun graphics add to the puzzle enjoyment of trajectory solutions in this comical monster theme game.  I personally like it.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|this is the most amazing movie ever haha<br />very much filled with a ton of action and you watch tifa kick ass<br />it arrived on time and in great condition and this is the only place to buy it that i saw<br />id recommend this to anyone
B00881VLCE|2.0|The app shuts down frequently.  Sometimes pieces won't move unless you tap it a lot.  The motto of &quot;It's time to relax&quot; just doesn't work out.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I won't go into any details or spoilers. I get not making every story end all happy-mushy-goo-goo. The end of the trilogy told us about changes, growth, and love. And that life happens....bad things happen along with the good, but life continues. The beginning of the story was pretty slow though. Very little happened for like half the book. When it finally picked up, it was pretty good; but I kept getting confused whether I was reading through Tris or Tobias. (Any time I had to close the book and come back to it) It was tough to get used to that, after the first 2 books being all from Tris' s point of view. All in all, a really good trilogy. I give the author kudos for being brave enough to do what she did in this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and am so glad they decided to make it available for the kindle and it was free.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much FUN! No matter if you are five or fifty you have a blast!  You don't have to be a reader to play or enjoy this game!
B006M4F67A|5.0|IT IS COMPELLING, WITH A FEW AIDS for those difficult times,IF YOU FEEL THE NEED. It does exactly what it says, by far the best of the puzzle apps that I've downloaded. I recommend this for anyone who likes a challenge because you feel obliged to return and beat your best time and I should mention that there are so many different majong assemblies to choose from so repitition is not a problem.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad this is finally available on the kindle. I'm hardly ever on the computer anymore so having this option on the kindle is a great option.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am glad I can play candy crush on my Kindle, I really like the game. Thanks for providing the app !!!!
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|It was good but I don't know if I would have paid to see it in theaters. The story line was good but it was drawn out in some spots in the movie
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Amazing<br />This app is better than any other app i have! Get it pleaseeee<br />Also, you can take clear video and uou can take pictures<br />Wait how many long seconds and there you go
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|So fun and addictive! A must play for the bored! Get this game as soon as you can or you're nuts!
B008EKOO46|5.0|Comprehensive and convincing arguments.  Very well analyzed and presented. Easy to read.  Impressive intellectual effort to cover such a high number of indigenous groups from different continents.  But apart from New Guinea it is not based on his own research and some of the tribes are hardly mentioned. As I have knowledge of Yanomami in Brazil I am skeptical to some of the examples he mentions from that area.
B00E6895M6|4.0|I really liked this group when &#34;The Mother We Share&#34; and &#34;Recover&#34; were released as singles in the UK. I also thought &#34;Gun&#34; was an interesting song for Lauren Mayberry to sing... I was eagerly anticipating the Bones of What You Believe and pre-purchased the CD on Amazon... Overall- I must say, I was a little disappointed. Some of the other songs in this cd seem to be &#34;filler&#34; and without any substance... However--if you like synth-pop and also like something different than the usual fodder out on the airwaves these days-- try this cd.. it is good-! For me--- I think that they were capable of greater things-- Perhaps on their next release!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad to finally be able to play on my tablet. Very calming yet very exciting levels of play. My favorite New game to play.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|A somewhat short album, but all the songs are great. My favorite at the moment is White Teeth Teens. She's incredibly talented and I can't wait to see where she goes from here.
B001N4OX82|5.0|I love this movie! I couldn't find one thing wrong with the movie. I know there are some movie mistakes and all but a lot of movies have those and I can deal with it. I do love this show highly recommend watching it.
0824835921|4.0|Awesome book! Great way to learn Kanji if you dedicate time to it and practice at least a couple times a week. I think the method is a good one that really works. However some of the background stories the author gives to help remember the kanji can be really strange, so sometimes it is better to make up your own. Many stories also have a very Christian influence and history reference to them, which could be unfamiliar or weird to many, again make up your own. The book I received was in good shape.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Page turner. This series just keeps you tuning the pages and wanting more.  The characters come alive on the pages.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|great movie with a lot of fun for the whole family. funny, creativ, never was the stonetime so entertainig.<br />awesome!
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|The premise is so interesting but the actual plot so predictable. He could have done so much more with this! It reads like a young adult novel, except for the sex. I finished it, but just barely.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Very good movie. Was well worth the money. I would recommend this movie.  Very good entertainment.  A must see movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy when this became available for kindle. be careful it is such an addictive game you wont ever want to stop

B00AO2P3GA|2.0|I tried loving in to play online and it does not let me it says password is incorrect or username does not exist I event and loved in in my computer and it let me I think there is a bug in it.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|First thing I noticed is, how often the key of B flat is used for these songs. Also, that Susan's vocal range on the album is all within what a trained contralto can generally sing, her lowest note (just one time) being G below Middle C, her highest (just one time) being F two octaves above Middle C. Susan may have somewhat the vocal quality of a mezzo, but the note range she uses here is that of a contralto for sure. A real plus is that Susan's diction is truly outstanding; one can understand EVERY WORD on every song, and that is saying something! Here are my thoughts regarding this album after several 'listens':<br /><br />O Come, All Ye Faithful--key of E flat; Susan sings first, then Elvis sings an octave lower, then they sing together (not in harmony but an octave apart) and the choir enters near the end. I was a bit disappointed in this one, first, because whatever Elvis recording was used here doesn't show his voice at its best by a long-shot, and second, because for me it was all a bit overly 'simple sounding' for a song chosen to become a charity single complete with video. It's nice enough, very listenable; just doesn't seem outstanding to me in any way. One thing I did notice is how LOUD it is, though--quite noticeable when I play the CD on my stereo with the huge Paradigm speakers. Perhaps that overall 'sound' (loudness, especially in the bass) is what might possibly make the single of this song quite popular?<br /><br />The Lord's Prayer--key of B flat; Susan begins this so slowly as to sound almost 'boring' but as one listens more, it actually works, since her oh-so-smooth voice can hang onto notes for impossibly long stretches, builds throughout the song, and on its final '(for)E---ver', she reaches her highest note on this album--F two octaves above Middle C. Strong and secure version of the song--I wondered how I'd like it, and for me, her version does stand up right alongside other fine versions, happy to say. It is difficult to sing this one so slowly and do it justice, yet she more than succeeds--such control!<br /><br />Little Drummer Boy--key of B Flat; a stirring, standout song on the album for me, despite it being basically a simple children's carol. Including some downright Celtic touches, this one is truly MADE for highland pipes, drone chants (here effectively rendered by The Overtones) and a rousing key change; one of its best features is the key change directly from B flat up to E flat, something highland pipes can fit into their rather limited diatonic abilities if a song's melody fits into Mixolydian mode rather than Ionian (straight major key). Begun softly, with Susan's voice and drones, then adding in drums, other instruments, stirring choir, and more drums plus pipes, then yet MORE of the same plus that awesome key change, Susan's vocals always building--wow! (Gives somewhat the same effect to be found in Mull of Kintyre, or what is often done with Amazing Grace when highland pipes are used in either song.) Likely to be one of the album's most-downloaded songs--wait and see!<br /><br />I'll Be Home for Christmas--key of G; such smooth, easygoing, wistfully sultry vocal tones; never allowing a 'break' in her voice, Susan could easily have stepped right out of the 40s/early 50s with this one. (For the record, this song includes Susan's 'lowest note' reached on the album, G below Middle C.) Gives a hint of that wonderful, slightly 'jazzy' vocal quality found so endearing in certain numbers on her Someone To Watch Over Me album. Choir used lightly and effectively, this song really pulls at one's heartstrings. I love it, and hope to hear more of Susan singing in this style on her future albums!<br /><br />When a Child is Born--key of B flat; Susan sings first, very simply; Johnny sings the 2nd verse an octave lower, and he still sounds phenomenal! The best part happens during the next verse when both sing together, Susan taking the melody line, Johnny the harmony line. Final verse effectively jumps just one-half tone from B flat to B, both sing together first in harmony, then ending the song with each singing one final line alone. VERY effective duet, and for me this one is an album standout, possibly to be one of its most-downloaded songs. Maybe, one of my VERY fave duets yet for Susan!<br /><br />The Christmas Song--once again, key of B flat; simple, smooth, understated, and elegant; again, sounds like another throwback to a sadly bygone era, and everything I mentioned about I'll Be Home for Christmas applies to this song as well. Holiday nostalgia at its best--more, Susan--we want MORE from you of songs sung like this! I could listen ALL day, and although I've enjoyed hearing many recordings of others singing this song throughout my life, this is quickly becoming my 'ultimate number one version' of it.<br /><br />I Believe in Father Christmas--key of A; unusual lyrics that make one think; fun, quirky rhythmic tricks in its really nice melody; beautiful, quasi-poignant vocals by Susan begun together with simple piano, later adding more voices and instruments yet never over-sung. The uilleann pipes are a real plus here. This was a new song for me, and I found it full of surprises, the melody and harmonies seeming to say one thing while the lyrics say quite another. 'The Christmas you get you deserve' line reminds me strongly of Perfect Day's 'You're going to reap just what you sow' final line, and is what made me really sit up and take notice of the song lyrics. Much Googling revealed various attempts to explain this song's ironic, almost bitter-sounding lyric twists, and because of that irony (plus its lovely melody) I am enjoying the song more every time I listen to it.<br /><br />Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas--key of G (lowest note G below Middle C)--yet another of the smooth, elegant songs which sounds as if it could have been recorded six decades ago. Perhaps my fave version of this song I've ever heard! I can just imagine Susan singing songslike this in an elegant jazz lounge, or small dinner theater, with only a piano, drums and perhaps a stringed instrument or two for accompaniment. This one brings to mind the vocals in her haunting, extremely fine 1999 CD recording of Cry Me a River. Hey--Susan can STILL 'do that'--thus I can't help but feel excited!<br /><br />Hark! The Herald Angels Sing--key of D; straightforward version with no 'tricks', just choir joining in nicely, growing especially on the 3rd verse. Susan's voice leaps out strong and secure all through this one; such a nice balance between her and the choir. Very listenable but perhaps not truly remarkable; instead, simply an honest, non-dressed-up rendition of a much-recorded, standard Christmas carol.<br /><br />The Christmas Waltz--key of D flat for a nice change (one of my very favorite keys--more about that later.) LOVE this 3/4 time's kicky little rhythm; it's a tad off-beat sounding, a treat for the ear, just Susan's voice and guitar and for me is the most enticing version of the song I've yet run across. Once again, this one is right up there with the likes of I'll Be Home for Christmas, The Christmas Song and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. (Am I beginning to sound like a broken record, describing four particular songs from this album which vocally for me are Susan's true personal standouts here?)<br /><br />In the Bleak Midwinter--back to good ol' key of D for this one. Have always loved this song; am so glad Holst thought to set such a wonderful old poem to music! Wistful; simply sung lyrics evoke a 'long ago during a typical cold-weather Christmas' feeling and Susan's easy vocal manner is perfect for the reverence, humility and almost childlike quality this song needs. The choir and building instrumentation add just the right touch without becoming overdone. Gorgeous!<br /><br />Miracle Hymn--seems to begin in B flat minor, but then alternates directly with its relative major, D flat, such that it's hard to say which keyis really its base (thinking D flat, as that is where the song ends)--the song's back-and-forth tonality lends it a haunting melody and luscious harmonies which I can't get out of my head! (Let me explain: I do have this 'thing' about pieces performed in D flat/B flat minor, such that their 'sound' always seems to pierce my soul, as for me, the same music sounds 'different' when performed in the different keys and modes and each evoke unique feelings.) This one is a real winner--Susan sings it in a reverent, straightforward fashion which never overpowers its intent; I think it'll be around for a long time as a new Christmas standard. People going to see The Christmas Candle are likely to leave the theater humming its catchy tune, and will want to learn all its beautiful words!
B00ELIKDXG|5.0|The Lollipop: Adventure Two, reunites us with brother and sister adventurers Alex and Katie, their Aunt Karina and another fabulous host of magical, wonderful beings.<br /><br />Written in the same wonderful style as Firebird, The Lollipop is a truly great, charming read, the audience once again being my small son who loved it so much that we had to start over again as soon as we were finished - thank you Julia!<br /><br />In The Lollipop, Alex and Katie adventure again to write the ending of the tale of Emelya and the talking pike, the fish who can grant wishes. Food, house and a wife for Emelya, but oh! the Tsar is unhappy that his daughter Maria is so in love with someone he deems unworthy and imprisons the poor man in a tower.<br /><br />When the siblings set out, they encounter the strange creature Leshi, his sweet tooth and marvellous lollipops, and on hearing the full story set out to right the wrong done to Emelya, and to re-unite the two.<br /><br />The Lollipop is really super, engaging and sweet (pardon the pun!) too. It is a great length for a bed-time read. I look forward to reading more from this author.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|This movie reminds me quite a bit of the anime Neon Genesis: Evangelion.  I kinda wish the movie was longer so we could see more battling of monsters and how each robot works with different weapons.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Alter Bridge is continuing to demolish the world of lazy, mundane music with this album! I've been a big fan of these guys since day one and this album does not disappoint. I could do the whole track by track review but instead I'll just say this, I consider this album to be a mix of the Blackbird positive/emotional blend and ABIII's heavy weight darkness. Sprinkle in some of Mark Tremonti's awesome independent album. Just buy it!
B00FPH6M82|3.0|The storyline is pretty good, but the acting is atrocious.  I was horribly disappointed in Will Smith and his son.  The movie had some good points, but was painful to watch at times due to this awful child actor.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|It's sad to say but I really thought I would of missed Geoff Tate not being in the band. Being a fan Todd LaTorre when he was in  'Crimson Glory'  I must say, what a transformation!! The new singer surpasses all my expectations and fulfills a rebirth of Queensryche all the fans have been yearning for! This is only the beginning and I can't imagine how Queensryche will sound on the next album!! Incredible!!
B007KL8Z40|5.0|Such an awesome voice! I discovered her when I attended the Capital Audiofest this year in the Marriott in Silver Spring, MD. It's where audiophiles far and away flock together in DC for three days to drool over ridiculously expensive speaker set ups in different rooms.<br /><br />I wandered into one of them and heard one of the most captivating voices I've heard in a while. If describing it, it would be between an ethereal sounding Enya, without the voice layering and Ellie Goulding. Pulled out the smartphone and looked up which artist it was and what came up on the Soundhound app was this Norwegian singer I never heard of, Ane Brun. I got the cd in a few weeks and was very impressed.<br /><br />Looked her up on Amazon and couldn't believe she's not more popular here. I don't really have the patience to write reviews but felt compelled to with this one since she deserves a lot more reviews than just eleven.<br /><br />Trust me, if you want to show off your audio equipment or just relax with some good music, this is the album to go with.<br /><br />Although I like all the tracks, the standout ones were \\"These days\\" (this was the song playing), \\"Do you remember\\", \\"Lifeline\\", \\"The light from One\\", \\"Oh Love\\" and \\"Undertow\\".
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Another Excellent Album from Dream Theater !! I loved it !! Dream Theater never lets me down. They are constantly evolving, keeping their sound, but also staying relevant !! Pick the Deluxe version up now!!
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|Cut down in its prime, &#34;Firefly&#34; was one of the best sci fi shows on the air. This movie wraps up a lot of loose ends as well as moves things forward.<br /><br />I STRONGLY RECOMMEND WATCHING THE SHOW BEFORE THE MOVIE.<br /><br />You don't NEED to, but it makes it better. It is, however, a good, fun space western that stands on its own with the sparkling dialogue you have come to expect from Whedon, and the solid performances you have come to expect from the crew.<br /><br />If I had a nitpic, other than 2 hours is not a great substitute for several more seasons of the show, it's that the effects, though better than the Show, are not a lot better. But, they still work.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so sweet and adorable!!! This is perfect for equestrian lovers everywhere!! Especially if you can't have a horse!
B000R7HY0K|4.0|This is as Tarnatino as Tarantino gets in many ways. Very self-indulgent, but if you like him, you won't mind.<br /><br />Kurt Russell's character is like an older (more evil, sorry for the spoilers) version of his character in Big Trouble in Little China.<br /><br />All the Quentin hallmarks are there, fast cars, long pop-culture-laden dialogue scenes, and confirmation that he has a thing for feet.<br /><br />I think Planet Terror was better, but this is still a great movie.
B000LI4DX6|5.0|I gave this a high rating cause I love this moving! I would recommend this movie to every one that loves a good laugh!!
B0039TD7PY|5.0|The stories and background for the songs adds wonderfully to the live performance. James and Carole are a great duet.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Very simple and effective. Easy to set up and keep track of progress. Manageable pace and good accountability setup. It just makes sense.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|So good!!!! This movie was great for several reasons. Firstly, it's honesty was refreshing and emotionally compelling. Lilo & Stitch is actually honest about the real world and the difficulties we face. It shows the challenge in family life, how losing your parents really does affect you, and family has a greater value than anything else in the world. That in itself made watching this movie an emotional journey for me. It teaches you that you can always make new friends, even in unlikely places. Heck, it shows that you can be friends with anyone, even evil genius aliens!! I think it's one of the best Disney movies ever made because of this. It also has one of the most original storylines ever. I don't think I even need to go into detail about that. Seriously, watch the movie.
B000I3UAJ0|5.0|This is not the extended addition of the director's cut of The Motion Picture, so there are some scenes, not crucial to the plot, but makes for good character development, that is missing. If you didn't know they were supposed to be there, you probably won't miss them. This is a good movie. I am not sure why it's frowned upon by so many people. It's true Star Trek, which is about humanity, exploration, relationships, and discovery. The improved special effects makes this movie much more enjoyable than before.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really nice awesome fun and exciting to play really love it my kids think its fantastic and fun to play
B00412I0IM|5.0|3rd time buying this. Stolen Vinyl, then stolen CD. Now I'm keeping this one under lock and key... My Baby is the song that got me back when it came out but the album is superb. Unopened Vinyl going for almost $400, does that tell you how good it is?
0764574124|3.0|This book has helped in some of the language of VBA. Although this book is not quit as comprehensive as I needed John Walkenbach did a good job for us Dummies. As a step up for assistance in learning VBA I also bought  Excel 2003 Power Programming with VBA.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|I thought this book was very well written.I especially enjoy books written in this era and in England or Australia. It just shows how women were viewed and especially the different classes.  The main character was such a gentle person and very strong at the same time. I would recomend this book to others and give it five stars.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Candy crush is a fun game that is additive, and challenging. The only thing that I get flustered at is the chocolate squares that fill in and you can loose your turn. The bombs also makes you lose your turn if you can not bust them up before they count down. It makes me upset, when this happens. The chocolate squares are not fair!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|The movie has a mission on making kids and adults realize on how important is to treat the earth, trees with respect and to care about trees because all living beings need clean oxygen. It is a very good movie!
B000RO9VJK|4.0|The strategies presented in this book are great for not just starting a business, but building a business. As a serial entrepreneur of failed businesses, I can relate to the experience  of doing all the work, resenting the customer, stifiling the growth of my own business, then finally just giving up. This book helped me see that starting a successful business doesn't begin with deciding on a name and buying stationery, but that I must truly plan out my business, from beginning  to end, BEFORE I start my business, to even have a chance of success. The link to the franchise model also hit home  as I'm now constantly thinking about how to implement a system for each task that must be completed.<br /><br />This book was on the suggested reading  list for a class I was enrolled in. Very glad I decided to take the time to read it!
B009NX409M|5.0|It was really well done and the chemistry between Deniro and Streep was top notch.  Plus New York, Christmastime in the 80's, great film.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Sometimes I needed a calculator (or pencil and paper) and the only thing I had around was my Kindle Fire.  I got this calculator because it was free.  Be careful, thought, because it is not a scientific calculator so parentheses would have been a nice feature that was not included.  The display is nice and big so I don't have to put on my glasses.
B00DYEBM2Y|5.0|There are many things wrong with my life at this point, but a new Mazzy Star album isn't one of them. Criticism that they haven't \\"evolved\\" as a group is valid but really, after such a long absence, the last thing I want to hear is something completely off-the-rails and off-putting. If the next album (please) sounds exactly the same, I might hate a little bit (just a little bit) but at the moment this is a nice, warm invitation back into their world. Thank you Hope Sandoval for getting the band back together!
B00DZPVS9O|5.0|Last Patrol is the ninth full-length studio album by the legendary Red Bank New Jersey based Stoner Rock (and so, so much more) band Monster Magnet. It was released in October 2013 through Napalm Records and was produced by frontman Dave Wyndorf himself alongside Phil Caivano.<br /><br />It is the band's first full-length album since Superjudge not to feature long time guitarist Ed Mundell, although long time fans will have noticed his absence from the past three year's worth of live dates. To be fair, Dave has done such a fantastic job of maintaining the signature Monster Magnet sound, vibe and attitude that this potentially critical loss is actually well compensated for. If you like what the band have done in the past this certainly won't send you running away in disgust.<br /><br />The album doesn't really have a snappy elevator pitch like \\"the band's doomiest album,\\" \\"the band's catchiest songs to date\\" or \\"the band's most experimental release yet\\" but there's clearly a reason why it's garnering so much positive attention from fans and critics alike. Give it a listen or twelve and let it get underneath your skin, there's a lot going on here and repeat listens allow it to fully reveal all of its many charms.<br /><br />The songs are mostly long, hypnotic and trippy numbers that focus on repeating one riff (acoustic or electric) over and over again on a rolling wave of sound effects or solos, building and building up teasing the listener with their constant threats of flat-out exploding. This isn't so much a collection of easily digestible radio singles but rather a more considered and slow-burning affair. Most of it could be described as laid back or chilled, although its not an distortion-free affair by any means either, so don't fear that it doesn't pick up the pace every now and again for variety.<br /><br />Its very much what you'd want from Monster Magnet to balance out the more immediate previous three albums. A bit of a nod back to their earlier days, without lapsing into falt out nostalgia-farming. You can still very much hear the 70s and particularly 60s rock influences, you still have Dave's absolutely phenomenal vocals, lyrics and undeniable charisma, and you still have virtuosic lead guitar work only now you get it all amidst the drawn-out, slower and trippier side of the band's many-sided skillset, like it was on the first three albums, but with a bit of the new days left in too for good measure.<br /><br />It's the kind of album that will have you nodding in agreement rather than jumping around, but its none the worse for it. If you took the three most trippy songs from Mastermind and extrapolated them into a whole album, then mixed in a bit of Dopes To Infinity's relationship between the hard bits and the light bits, you'd have something vaguely approaching the style of Last Patrol.<br /><br />Highlights include the lively `End Of Time,' (which mixes a Mastermind style bounce with that Hawkwind-influenced Superjudge style) the dynamic single `The Duke (Of Supernature)' which is fabulously entertaining on repeat listens, and the Magnetized Donovan cover `Three King Fishers' which is pretty captivating all around.<br /><br />Overall; Last Patrol is yet another high quality album from the undeniably unique and interesting band, and it definitely deserves a place in your collection. It's a bit of a grower, so give it a fair chance and time to sink in, but in general, if you like the band you should be pretty happy with this release. If you can, try and the special edition version as the two bonus tracks are really enjoyable, not throwaway afterthoughts but rather genuinely cracking Magnet songs that just didn't fit the album's tone.out lapsing into falt out nostalgia-farming.

B004PGAQMW|5.0|My son loves this movie. I was able to buy it from Amazon for about $5.00, which is about 1/2 less than the other sellers. Plus my son can access it at any time and from any place.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|It's free cell and this ap works well. If you like free cell you'll like this ap. Price was right too.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I love the inspiring sounds of this album. I heard it on Pandora and thought it was a movie for the longest time. It should be!

1617751588|5.0|This is a very cute book with pictures that all cat lovers will be able to relate too. My favorite picture was of Simon when he was sick and the two cats curled up on him while he was laying in bed. Times like that make being a cat owner totally worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Didn't care for this particular puzzle/game app.  Have a downloaded<br />many other ones that peaked my interest much more.  Didn't see what<br />ALL the 'fuss' was about this one!
B00124PXW8|4.0|Great acting, a little scary, and plot was perfect. There were parts that were definitely disturbing; however, isn't that what you would expect with a girl being possessed by a demon?
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a challenging game. Lots of variety in the puzzles. Really tasks your skills of observation and matching what you see.
B0053TMP24|4.0|The second book in the Heroes of Olympus series is a slight improvement over it's predecessor, which was good read in itself. Percy Jackson returns with new friends on an adventure to the frigid land beyond the gods.<br /><br />The first 100 pages can be a little annoying. Riordan has two new POV's to introduce, and really abuses the 'oh, let's talk about something important. Oh wait, nope, we got interrupted!&#34; trope a lot in the beginning. After that though, the book reverts back to the magic of the original Percy Jackson series.<br /><br />There are a lot of reasons that this book is better than the first in the series. Having one established point of view helps cut down on all the extra set-up the last one had. There isn't any reveal of the big bad dragged out long after the audience has already figured it out. And the POV's break off at irregular intervals, so the plot isn't quite as predictable.<br /><br />This book has tons of action, humor, and fun for all ages. I was a bit skeptical after the first book in the series, but this one renewed my faith.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|Quote: \\"Clever and heartening takes on popular music. From Beethoven to Adele, a unique mix of classical, film score, rock and pop favourites\\" I love their music and their videos. They are really inspiring! However, I have to say, I was a bit disapponited because my favourite song \\"Don't You Worry Child\\" is not in any of the CDs I bought. Anyway, what they do is fantastic! I hope to see them in concert someday.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|Great item, fast shipping!  Some people panned this movie, but it is fantastic.  It is the new age of con movies (I.e. The sting) and this one did a great job ushering it in.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|They are as good as everyone says. I have mine modded with the Beyerdynamic EDT 250 velour ear cups, and a nice amp on them, and they are heaven.<br /><br />Even with the stock ear pieces though, these are extremely comfortable headphones too. And I was surprised that they look much nicer in real life. Very attractive with the thick velour cups and speaker foam gone.<br /><br />If you want reference level fidelity and strong isolation from outside sounds, look no further.<br /><br />They are also extremely efficient and sound great just off my S4 phone or tablet.<br /><br />Great headphones! Enjoying them on an audiophile headphone amp with good specs but looking forward to building them a nice tube amp.

B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Allie Brosh combines her unusually keen insight with extreme candor and her laser-sharp sense of humor and illustrates it with cartoon drawings that always capture and enhance the essence of her point. If, like me, you're a long-time reader of her blog, you will recognize several of the essays from there, but you won't mind re-reading them. in fact, you might re-RE-read them, because they are some of her best work. And the new material in the book was so worth waiting for. Allie hit a homerun with this book and I hope she continues to write, whether on her blog or for future publications.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game lots of fun.  Downloaded Candy Crush to my Kindle HD so I can play it anywhere.  I also play on my lap top.
B00F30S0Y0|2.0|This seems another sidestep for Arcade Fire rather than moving forward or more deeply into what they've done well.  It is over produced and over-engineered, its songs more contrived than composed.  At their best, they can make sings build from their lyrics and fundamental dynamics.  Here songs just get more buzz, more percussion, more noise.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I, like many people, was a fan of Brosh's blog before buying the book.  You don't need to already be a fan, though, to appreciate it; two seconds of reading anything she's ever written should make you an insta-fan, and if it doesn't, I'm sorry, your sense of humor is broken.  Brosh is not only hilarious, but also very insightful and relatable.  You should buy this book for yourself, and then get a copy for everyone you know.
1937053571|5.0|I will admit to being terrified to read this book.  The ending of this incredible series that I have loved so much - would things work out?  Would Alex and Aiden get a HEA?  Would Ares get his butt kicked?  Was there any way this brilliant author could make things work out?  Oh, I can't tell you any of that but I will tell you that I stressed.  I cried.  I screamed.  I gasped.  I sputtered.  WTH?  Really?  OMG!  Did that just happen?  Are you freaking kidding me?  Yep, that just about sums it up.  It's an emotional ending to a brilliant series.<br /><br />Alex is broken from her fight with Ares.  She's not the same and something is really wrong with her.  She's not sure she's the one to lead the army of awesomeness and she may be right.  She steps out of character a lot but with good reason.  One, she had been through a lot and two, something was definitely up.  And that is the brilliance of this last book.  Armentrout keeps us guessing and hopping throughout.  It's not just leading up to one big bang near the end, no the unexpected is popping up everywhere - especially with Alex.<br /><br />Aiden.  Hot damn, I didn't think I could love this boy more but I do.  He stands by Alex.  He sacrifices for Alex.  He's totally jealous, which is super cute.  He takes some serious licks in this book but that boys love knows no end.  I was proud of him.  I fell all over for him.  I want to hug him and cuddle him and....yeah I know he's Alex's but I can dream can't I?<br /><br />I have to say something about Seth.  I have never been a Seth fan.  I saw through him from the first time I met him.  Shallow and self-centered, I never thought he cared for Alex.  I never saw the self-sacrifice that Aiden constantly showed.  But Seth has redeemed himself.  That is all I have to say about that.<br /><br />The story is fast paced and, oh, so good.  I couldn't put it down.  Really, this book kept surprising me.  Every time I thought I had something figured out, things would turn and I was stunned.  My beloved characters went through so much and I right along with them.  This whole world evolved and I admit to liking  the result.  I freaking LOVED the ending.  It's perfect.  Just perfect.<br /><br />My fear about reading it was justified and unfounded.  While I hate to see this series end, I love the way it does it.  And as long as I can re-read and have more JLA books, I'm a happy reader.<br /><br />If you have been reading this series, then RUN and get this one NOW.  If you haven't had the pleasure of reading the Covenant series, then start.  It's great paranormal YA.stunned.  My beloved characters went through so much and I right along with them.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|How dare you create such an awesome game lol. Great fun and quite addicitive. Thanks folks. Great sharing with my friends too.
B001NLKSI4|4.0|Very good follow up with more details on his rise and subsequent fall from top.  Loved getting the &#34;in between&#34; details and am just that much more excited for the release of the movie (based on book #1).  I read both books - approximately 500 pages each - in 2 weeks.  Great reads!
B001LXIDVS|5.0|got it to replace a loaned one that was never returned
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this app. It's so much fun for me and my four year old daughter! Definitely recommend this to help pass the time!

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. I couldn't guess the outcome and it was heart warming
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This author has a very eloquent style of description, which makes it very easy to imagine the incredible scenery and characters. Great storyline....can't wait to start the next book in the series!
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|The Walking Dead is not the most well written show or the best development, plot/story arc but.. there are zombies!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I can download videos that I like go into my photos and its there. I love it I can save songs and funny videos and share it with my friends
B00870Z05U|5.0|Okay, so this is a totally different style from the first, but still thoroughly entertaining.  The plot is very depressing, but also so hammy that I laughed when I should have cried.  'Christine' and 'Madame Giry' have fantastic voices.  Lewis is great too, but I personally feel his voice is not suited for this role.  Mostly it seemed like he was singing in a church, rather than in a theatre as the bad-a ss phantom we all know and love.  Overall, this left a smile on my face; but I will probably go on obsessing over the first one, which was of course incomparably superior.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I use this app every day. I use it to have my note books for school. I write stories. I can put down son lyrics. What Ever I Want! Then I can sit back turn it to pdf file and read or study it
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|Freddy Krueger: one of the best horror movie villains of all time.This collection showcases the first 7 nightmare films, except for the &#34;reboot&#34;  of the series which wasn't a good movie. The packaging was great and the collection came without a single scratch or damage. I'll edit my review later to include a review of the bonus disc. Only complaint it's that the bonus disc is a DVD and not a Bluray disc. Most of you have already seen the movies so I see no point in reviewing them but I will include aspects like image quality and audio...
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The app is great. I love the video's and the mpoints that I get for using it. I have used the weather channel app on my phone for years. It's the best.
1452126577|5.0|This book shows any doubters out there (doubters? really?) that Tardar Sauce really is the cutest little grump and she will bring a smile to even the crabbiest mud sucker.
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|Anyone who lives in a pack with dogs will relate to this.  It captures the wonder, joy and puzzlement of dogs.  I live with three dogs and one cat. The cat has a lot of patience with the rest of us. At times.
1416550542|4.0|Kate Morton does a fine job of telling this story and keeping the reader engaged.<br /><br />Near the end...the story is somewhat predictable, but delightful, too.
1476727651|5.0|Stephen King's THE SHINING is a classic to which I never expected to read a sequel, yet DOCTOR SLEEP came seemingly out of nowhere and now that I've read it it's hard to imagine either complete without the other. This is a very different reading experience than the original, yet it dovetails beautifully with the first and emerges a modern epic that's so much more than the sum of its parts. Far more than a simple horror story, it picks up with Dan Torrance from childhood after his fateful winter in the Overlook (odds are, you already know that story), the follows him through the lowest rock-bottom of his young adulthood, to unexpected heroic redemption as he confronts the demons of his past. Ultimately the continuing history of Torrance family and their troubled history (both in battles with inner demons in the form of alcoholism and apparent weirdness-magnetism through the gift-curse of the shining) offers both a ripping modern supernatural adventure yarn while giving the original tale some extra full-circle closure and extra emotional resonance it (and a certain character who gets an unexpected final-say appearance) always deserved. In addition to further development of Dan Torrance up through middle age (with a welcome early reappearance by Dick Halloran), Abra Stone and Rose the Hat of the True Knot become equally fleshed-out, fascinating characters you will never forget. One of King's most fascinating (and often darkly comical) accomplishments is how in many ways the villains here become as fleshed-out and -in many ways--likeable as our heroes Dan and Abra. He never lets us forget that the Knot is a pack of corrupt monsters who need to be stopped, and their arrogant aloofness amidst the suffering they inflict calls to mind the hubris of society's all-too-real empowered, self-entitled villains. Yet evil people don't think of themselves as evil, something of which King is clearly maturely aware. Within their closed society, perpetuating their semi-immortality by torturing and murdering us \\"steam-head rubes\\" is as normal as eating a cheeseburger, and their interpersonal squabbling, their shared daily joys and sorrows, are as real as those between you and your own closest friends and family. When they suffer loss among their own, you feel the grief with them accordingly. That's not to be mistaken for King dealing in \\"moral ambiguity\\". You won't hesitate to cheer for for Dan and Abra as they learn together to embrace their power and take the bastards down. It must be addressed, much of King's work (particularly his later stuff, and there I'll largely be the first to agree) has been called to task for a self-indulgently bloated style, as though at some point he went \\"To hell with listening to an editor; I'm Stephen Freaking King!\\" Such is not the case here - This is a hefty chunk of reading, but make no mistake, there's no wasted space. King found himself a *lot* of story to tell here, and the gears click into place as they need to, a step at a time while at a snappy pace. There are lengthy asides of supporting character development, where a lesser writer would have me going, \\"Okay...okay...why exactly do I need to know all this?\\" yet King merely spurred me to turn the pages faster, eager to learn how this complex tapestry all ties together. That's how you know you're in the hands of a master.  This is a tale rich in all the nuance and detail a great epic character-driven story needs, with nothing it doesn't. There's not much more I can tell you without giving too much away, but suffice it to say, by the ending of this, I could stand to spend another book or two with some of these characters. Certainly it's reminded me why I've loved Stephen King since I was Abra's age. This book shows him in top form, and it's a masterpiece.
1401324649|5.0|This is a fun story.  Light, laugh-out-loud reading.<br />The story smacks a bit of Water for Elephants...but takes the reader in a whole different direction.
B000000OF6|5.0|If you are Queen fan this is a must have.  Great collection of songs!  I'd recommend it to anyone anytime!
B00E5N8E6K|5.0|Best concert DVD I have ever seen! Anyone who doesn't think this band belongs in the hall of fame needs to watch this.
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|This is a great series and I got the set quickly.  It is exactly as advertised and I am enjoying it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the story..love the time period...love the actors......a step back in time with all the trimmings. The costuming is wonderful. Very addictive, always looking forward to the next episode!
B0031KE9C6|3.0|Not bad but not great.  I love investigative shows and this one has a nice daughter / father relationship but it definitely leans in the implausible side of things.  If you love real life crime dramas you might want to check out a new incredible book on the OJ Simpson and George Zimmerman cases:<br />[[ASIN:0615871453 When Prosecutors Attack!: OJ Simpson, Roderick Scott, George Zimmerman - Baseless Government Attacks and the Media That Lets It Happen]]
B002VPE1WK|3.0|The quality is not the best; lots of good-sized compartments with full customization. Just could stand to have more padding.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Glad to finally have this on Kindle! The conversion is great, no glitches thus far. Connects to fb seamlessly, and hasnt frozen or spazzed out. Great brain game, addictive yet fun.  Thank you Kindle!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This was bought as a Christmas present, but I have heard some of the music on it, and as usual Josh Groban's singing is amazing.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|A great show!! Well written, completely addicting, this show delivers the good stuff episode after episode! FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY AROUND!!
B00EKXDVOK|5.0|Beautiful music.  Barbra Streisand has a beautiful voice and always comes through. This CD contains a good selection of songs.
0670024856|5.0|Love this book.  So interesting! The writing is excellent.  She has an excellent command of personality, location and the topics included.  One of the best I've read this year. I highly recommend this book.
B00459EZLW|4.0|One of those series that I just never had the time to watch. I had heard good things about it, so, I did a marathon on it and really, really liked it. Wish SIFI would have had a little more patience with it.
B00F6G7VJG|5.0|Excellent novel, very interesting insight into North Korea.  The writing is superb.  Recommend very highly to anyone who enjoys a wide range of topics.  It's a little slow at first, but well worth the initial investment in patience.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I loved this!
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|Great album. Explicit, but I believe there is an edited version that is censored for those with sensitive ears ;) .
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|Fun game perfect for the Halloween spirit. Good app of the day. Its a little addicting.........ok i really like it
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|This production was out of the box it was a new and refreshing version of a great play. I hope Weaton gives us more like this.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|If you like big fantasy series you must read these books morgan rice is a great author and has builder an amazing world
B00G32OER4|4.0|Edge of your seat movie. I jumped several times while watching.  If you like supernatural/horror movies definitely worth a watch.
006202406X|4.0|I am glad the reviews didn't scare me off from reading. It wasn't as good as the first two books, but I am glad<br />I read it. I actually applaud Roth for not taking the storybook ending and instead tackling issues of pain and loss, especially as her audience is teens.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Loved this movie! It's fast paced, entertaining and imaginative. Everyone I've talked to that has seen it says the same.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|At nine-hundred pages this is a long read. I would give the first 300 pages 5 stars, the next 300 three stars and the last 300 two stars. I started skimming during the final battle. Having read every book in the series I am sad to have it end but I guess that all things have an ending, even the Wheel of Time. Thanks for writing them.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Another great Tom Cruise action flick.  Excellent script and great plot line.  Tom Cruise never fails to please whenever he makes an action movie.
B0078XFYDA|4.0|His research is thorough and clearly recorded, citing points of interest and suggesting further investigation(s), and telling us why he would suggest further study..
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is very entertaining. I also enjoy being able to customize each bot. I wonder if they are going to make a sequel which will probably stink. But for now I can play this game. The kid in the movie is probably to big to be cute anymore anyway, and wolverine doesn't need the cash. Oh well at least I can play this game and pretend I'm the cute kid and wolverine is my dad! Thanks Amazon.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|This movie is one of the best grafic powered movie. You can see the details on the exo scelotens robots, or whatever you want to call them, and the audio is also amazing. If you see the movie, you'll love just as much as I do. BUT one little thing I kind of not a fan of, som of the carachtors go INSIDE the Alines, and cut them in two with their super sonic knife...
B008VRM7QO|5.0|Great research, well written and very interesting. I found this true story to be chilling, and a reminder what humans are capable of if given the opportunity and there are inadequate social and legal controls.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|Buy this book for your children and read it every night to them before bed. My sister owns a day care so she has tons of books and she was sorting through them and asked me if I had ever read this particular book to my kids before. I told her I hadn't and she said, \\" You've got to read it, please, just take 5 minutes and read it quick.\\" She brought the book over to me and said, \\" here, read it, just try not to cry ! \\" I am a sensitive person yes, but, to cry over a children's book ! I thought to my self, sure, what ever sis , surely I'm not gonna cry over a children's book!!!! I was so positive I would not cry!! I began reading(out loud to her and day care kids), and omg there was no holding it back for me. I was so choked up I could not get the words out to read the last page. I saw the picture for the last page and from the prior page as well, and I just knew what this last page would read. It was just so very touching. This book is so real and true to life in my home and so many others around the world. This reads as if it's words had come from my own mouth. This is exactly how my life is except, I'm young still at 33 and am losing my dad. I the same as this story will always love my children and want to hold them and cherish them close until the day I can't even pick them up anymore. My dad was this way with me when I was little and still is till this day at my ripe age of 33, and now that I am losing him sooner than I should be I am holding, loving and taking care of him as he has for me all my life and no matter what, he always loved me and held me through all the good and the bad, baby to adult. I love love love this story.!!!!!!!!! You just have to please take the time and money to read this one.!!!!!!!! This story is the story of a parent's love for their child through out their entire lives, and too about the cherish, respect and love a child has for their parent through till the end of their life. Wow wow wow I just love this book so much I can't tell youenough hoe touching and to to our life cycle this book is. If this book doesn't reflect a humans life between parent and child then I feel such sorrow for you. All humans should live in love as is in this book. Kudos to the author and illustrator!!!!!!!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I love playing this game. It's a little frustrating though. Just enough to keep me coming back for more! Two thumbs up!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love it! This is the first app I use every time I get a new phone. Can't live without it. Thank you
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Finally made it through. I was worried about the middle of the book. It seemed like it started dragging but then it got a little better. So many unexpected deaths. Still it turned itself around. Feels like with so many threads though that it might be nice to have some loose ends tied together. Overall better than I thought after years of expectation.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of levels, color graphics, sounds and candy crush saga fun. I play other games on King. I think King is GREAT!
B005PK56TA|5.0|I watched some of Asylum on cable and it was really different so I thought I would watch season one to see how Asylum came to be. I was completely sidetracked when I couldn't put the characters together then I seen online that they have no Correlation so then I enjoyed it a lot more. Disappointed that they do not continue this season especially since they left it at climax cliffhanger but it is understandable that they want a different story every time. If you want to watch something really different, weird, strange and interesting thus is for you. Love the creepy theme song.
B006WMILQU|5.0|This movie has long been a favorite of mine. It is well acted and has a beautiful, lyrical quality that complements Jane Austen.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|A thought provoking account of a young man in search of his purpose. I found it sad that the realization came too late.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Amazing storytelling from the spectre of the reaper.  A look at how the Nazis destroyed their own people and the horrible effect of their hatred.  The six million souls destroyed in the camps and th.. many more destroyed on places like Hummel STreet.  An Incredible story with an amazing narrator.
B00B8R1NP0|3.0|This story hits you between the eyes from page one. We readers become privy to each murder in graphic detail, and hope against hope that the main character Max, and his new partner Jesse, piece the puzzle together as deftly as possible and with much haste as the death toll increases. The deaths seem so senseless, but all is revealed at the very end.<br /><br />There was one point where I thought the two partners might get it together, and I was seriously hoping that wasn't the case, since their first meeting was quite chilly, and it was obvious that neither liked the other. That's usually when we find them, three-quarters through the story, in bed with each other in the most predictable way. However, I was spared this cliche, and their bond in actual fact relied completely on something other than romance and was more tangilble, which was refreshing.<br /><br />There is a twist at the end that wasn't completely unexpected, but it was handled well, and overall this was a good story, but I wouldn't say it was nail-bitingly original.
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|One of my all time favorite books, movie just as good!  Cast, scenes, and backdrop of the period did the book justice!
B005F9CPG8|5.0|Purchased as a gift, they are a Beatles fan and really loved it, can't go wrong with this.  Great gift for a fan
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app beats weather live.  Not as pretty, but more detail.  I wish I spent my remaining Amazon<br />coins  on this one .
0062082353|5.0|Over all an amazing book about an amazing person.  As a subject I wish there were more than 5 starts to rate it higher, as a piece of well written literature it could be better.  The storytelling and chronology jumps around a bit but not such that it kills the story.  Some people didn't like the parts written by his wife and while they weren't reviting, they fill out the sacrafices by the men and women that serve out country and how their families sacrafice just as much to defend our country.  If you want to learn about what goes on in the mind of a warrior and how they view things this is a great book, I think anyone one who has interest in military history or psycology would love it and I think pretty much everyone should read as a tribute to Mr. Kyle and all our armed forces.<br /><br />When I learned he had been killed in such a senseless way I was heart broken, and dissappointed our media didn't give it more press.  This country lost a great man and barely anyone seemed to notice.  He died helping someone as he always did and I would like to say thank you to Mr. Kyle and his family for all the endured to protect my freedom.  He left this world much too soon but did so much to make it a better place, I am glad I read this book to hear a small part of his story and of the men he sreved with.  Thank you again and rest in peace.
0446618322|4.0|Sweet story.  I'm not much of a &#34;reader,&#34; but this kept me hooked until I finished it!  The last chapter seemed like a bit of an afterthought, though.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Bought as a gift, they loved it, great for a Katty Perry fan, can't go wrong buy it if you like her and you won't be disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app is really captivating.  It starts pretty simple, but soon becomes more challenging.  It may be a little addictive.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is very easy to use, and was just what I was looking for. I also love all of the advanced features it has too.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a wonderful series and the third book, Mockingjay, is as riveting as the first two, but even better because it answers questions that have been plaguing us - will the Games ever end? Does Katniss ever learn to love? What becomes of President Snow? Terrific ending. Highly highly recommended.
B002E0JL4A|3.0|If you love Robin Williams, you'll love this movie. It's his from start to finish. The film does raise some interesting questions about how doctors treat patients as &#34;things&#34; rather than people.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved this book but the ending is unforgivable Trish dies I am officially a hater of these series. :(
B005CAPS0K|3.0|Entertaining but a little weird at times.  If you want a moderately scary move that will make you jump a couple of times this isn't too bad of a choice.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Lots of fun. Thought that it was a kids game but the more I played it the more I have gotten into it. I recommend it as a time killer.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Good story!  Has a lot of really good characters and takes turns that you don't expect.  Keeps me interested!  Try it!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game is so fun and sometimes annoying when people take your stuff but other whys the game itself is super fun guys keep it up
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|candy crush saga is really awesome I mean if I can play it online and love it imagine how awesome it would be to play it anywhere on my mobile device everyone should get candy. crush saga plus ITS FREE!!!!!
B003VANOFY|4.0|4/5 Stars<br /><br />Great headset. Compared to my old $50 purchase of another headset this one completely blows it out of the water. I would give 5/5 except that the microphone quality pales greatly to even one of my cheapest headphones. The mic quality is STUCK on tape recorder quality and the option to change it higher has been greyed out. I experience this on both win7 and win8 and so far many people are suffering from this. The microphone has a certain \\"tinny\\" sound much like listening to someone through the speaker of a phone. If you would like to hear the quality search it up on you-tube. Overall good headset, comfortable fit, made out of high quality materials on the inside, I experience perfect sound from 40 feet away and some more, battery life is very good. I am very satisfied with this product.
B009PK9SB8|3.0|Works as it should, however the cases that come with it do not fit the back of my GoPro Hero 3+. The only thing this is good for his if you have it out of the case and are taking pictures or videos. I rarely use it not that I can view from my phone. Here is a video review of it when I first got it. [...]
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is really great.  I love every minute of the game.  I am up to level 17 and I am stuck, but I will figure it out.  I don't give up easily.
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|Cool looking and interchangeable. Phone is fully protected and volume rocker is accessible with my iPhone 5s. Here's a hands on video review:[...]
B000VWQG78|1.0|I don't know why, but a few of the songs end way too early. I'm not sure if it's because of my end, or that's how it was sold to me. It's a great album but I can't really enjoy it if part of a song isn't there.
B000OSDSKM|4.0|Seven Days in May is an outstanding movie with an edge-of-your-seat plot.  Oscar worthy performances by a legendary cast.  Along with the cold war thriller Fail-Safe, a very underrated movie.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love it keeps me going  keeps my mind busy ,  the challenge of the game. And all the fun of the game. Can't wait for the  next level.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I came across this book set on accident and couldn't be more glad. This is one of the best stories I've read in some time. Can't wait ti read the rest.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Crisply and compellingly narrated in alternating chapters by orphans of different generations, the novel spans most of the past 100 years and several thousand miles of American geography. The characters stay with you long after you're done reading.
1452105111|4.0|Super cute garland for my son's first birthday party!  Was able to spell out a bunch of phrases and it was easy to assemble.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|It is a good read but drags in a few places. The history is great and the characters are &#34;real&#34; and fully dimensional.
B003XMKMTQ|5.0|This is my second order for this DVD.  I wore out the first one!  Blues legends doing awesome versions of their best songs, some anecdotes - what more could you ask for?
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|Brilliance once again! I don't want to jinx 'em, but I could easily see Reflector winning another Grammy for Album of the Year. And why wouldn't you want to own the Album of the Year?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's fun and it's addictive. There are so many levels and a wide variety of challenges.Everyone I know loves it! You gotta give it a try :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have enjoyed playing! I wish there were better instruction. you just have to figure it out as you go.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|Love it live! Her sweet voice and his spirited slide guitar with the tight rhythms and grooves of the band make this a must have for jam band and rockin blues loves!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm glad it's finally available for the Kindle Fire. I'm having so much fun with this game. It can be really challenging sometimes ... I recommend it!
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|I only caught a few shows when it aired on TV. Even then it was impressive even though I wasn't quite sure of the continuing story line. However after watching the DVD series in proper sequence it all really gelled together and was riveting from start to finish. I really liked the why the show took us on a journey that completed a full circle. The imagery, the verbal exchanges between the main characters, the food porn dished up by Hannibal, the menacing look and sound of the series made it the best thing I've seen since Breaking Bad. It has motivated me to order and read the original books. Can't wait for series two.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Way fun game! Whole family loves it! Challenging enough for everyone yet it also is good for kids! Way awesome. Other than limited lives and need friends help its way great!
B003GK21OE|5.0|Fast, intense and easy to read, no need to think, just relax ! He's eminent storyteller and you will be fascinated and surprise! The last side in the book comes to soon.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest!  So simple to use and there is so many inspiring things to do and see!  I only wish more people pinned directions to certain crafts rather than just the picture
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I have been a Stephen King devotee for many years and was truly looking forward to this sequel to my favorite book .  I did think the book was worth reading, but found little connection to The Shining.  The idea of the true knot was interesting, but not really elaborated upon enough for my liking.  In the end I'm just not sure the Danny from my mind could be this character.  I also didn't find the book very scary, and I miss the spine tingling books of early King.
B008M721MS|5.0|This  app is really fun it helps  reconnect to my friends all over the world.I Think you will enjoy this app
B00BB3UYS8|3.0|This story was interesting and I finished the book.  However, it is the first book of a series, and not a complete book by itself.  The ending is very abrupt and leaves you hanging.  If you want to learn more, you have to purchase the second book.  I didn't like it enough to do that.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this game...hurry with the updates....I got the whole family playing...even the kiddies! man...just get it trust me! why do the reviews have to be 20 words...
B000000OR9|5.0|Great CD from the quintessential Whitesnake guitarist, John Sykes! This guy showed great hooks, musicianship, technique, songwriting, and tone, tone, tone! One of the best albums from this era of rock music. Every song is a winner on this album. No weak points at all. Also, the rhythm section of Tony Franklin and Carmine Appice are bombastic! What a powerhouse. Tony has been my favorite rock bassist for years, and his bass line and fretless tone really contribute to this album. And Carmine's drums are just rock-solid.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|It is a fast pace movie with lots of action and fights. It is perfect for entertainment. The time goes by.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My kid loves this movie and I do too!  It's a great movie for girls or boys.  Some semi-violent parts to watch out for.
B00FRMDH7Y|3.0|It is a funny movie that entertains kids, but there is nothing special. My kids watched two times only.  When they really like one movie, they see it many many times.
B0063M22QO|3.0|This Mahjong game is just fun and relaxing. The game  can take your mind off of your troubles or concerns.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. It's different and exciting to see a hidden object game with a goal. Not just find items in a list and the game is over.thanks for the fun.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Excellent book, very well written. Very imaginative world. Captivating story and narrative from the beginning to the end. So glad I read it without having seen the film.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This game is so awesome you could compare this to G.T.A. Well grand theft auto is better but this is still fun
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush so addicting. I hate when I have to wait for lives on a hard level but that's because I won't pay to get more lives.
B004132I20|5.0|Bravo BBC for a fantastic moderninzation of the original stories.Loved the series so much just had to own them for myself
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|When I heard that there was a show about zombies I was immediately turned off. I love zombie movies. I love the classics like Night of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead, etc but a show about zombies, nah. After my coworkers went on and on about the show, I decided to check it out. Its more than a slightly cheesy zombie show. Its really about human instinct and our fight to live. The show is pretty good, pretty suspenseful. Keeps you wanting to know whats going to happen next.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This series is an fantastic modernization of the original stories.Loved the show so much just had to own it for myself
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is very analytical and entertaining. You do have to use your noodle quite a bit but is an awesome game all the way.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I read this right after Killing Jesus. The two are both historical accounts but this gives deeper into the life outside of the ministry. It does not offend any religious believe and offers a different perspective of the post resurrection Church.
1451683405|5.0|The merits of this work have been well represented in many previous reviews.  To the reader without a preconceived agenda of their own, without the need to prove or disprove statements made by Mr. Harris before even opening it, an honest reading of &#34;Free Will&#34; will provide enormous food for thought about how we judge ourselves and others.  Mr. Harris fundamentally accepts the fact that we must protect and defend ourselves in this life from dangerous and dysfunctional people and at no time does he morally equate a successful, contributing citizen to a murdering sadist, despite the ridiculous accusations that pop up everywhere one sees this book discussed.<br />Sadly, as with most of Mr. Harris's work, those who stand to grow the most from reading and trying to ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND him are the most guilty of illogical, irrational and downright dishonest distortions of what he actually says.  If there is one fact about Mr. Harris’s writing that is troublesome, it is that he may give his average reader too much credit, expecting them to set aside reflexive reactions to any unwelcome argument long enough to hear what he says, all of what he says and ONLY what he says at any given time. However, to do otherwise would probably require him to allocate more space in his writing to anticipating the distortions of others than to actually making his point, and I for one enjoy his concise and well-argued style.<br />This is a very thought-provoking book for the intellectually honest reader and a controversial thorn in the side of the dogmatic one.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Bought this for my husband because all our friends say it is a must watch! Can't wait to get into it, but we need to see the last season of Dexter first.
B00CKKDZ2S|3.0|I love this app because it gives u a good message for everyday and for your past, present and future.  I request this app to people to give them a good message.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally this game is available on the Kindle. This was the first game I searched for when I got this. Very addictive and fun..yay! ^_^
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|As other reviewers have noted, this book is reminiscent of Patrick Rothfuss & his Kingkiller chronicles, though slightly different in that it becomes clear that the version of the tale we are told is more complete than that shared with the scribe aboard the ship. Pacing was a little slow in places but given the level of detail in Ryan's world building, that is not too surprising. POV changes every now and then, and the story is not told in a linear fashion; I had to pay a little more attention to setting/italicized sections to get cues on where certain chapters picked up.<br /><br />I have a bone to pick with the editors (perhaps just for the Kindle edition?)--check for typos! It's likely that the numerous errors are a result of spell check/software issues, but I think it's fair to say that the publisher should have set an extra pair of eyes on this book before it was published. It decreased my reading pleasure by just a hair... I found myself re-reading a few sentences to make sure I didn't interpret things incorrectly.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next installment in this series.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The sad thing is the Divergent and Insurgent are really very good, but now they'll never be read. Truly the ending of a story makes or breaks the future telling (or reading) of it. I loved Divergent. Insurgent was okay, but I was already invested. Allegiant makes me want to rewrite history so that I never started the series. I'm sorry Ms. Roth, I don't like being so harsh, but this is the nice truth.
B00ENXBUR2|4.0|I thought this film in the new age of superhero movies was excellent. For all those who want to compare this film to original superman movies should just keep watching the originals and let the rest of us enjoy change. To each his own. I thought it was packed with awesome effects. And what a great makeover for general sod.(stupid auto correct). I can't wait to receive my collectors edition with the superman S with stand. Package looks awesome. Maybe people shouldn't. Be so critical on new films and just enjoy the show with open minds...just sayin'
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I have greatly enjoyed the writing of this series since its inception and season 5 doesn't disappoint. It's a family favorite at our house so picking up the DVD release was a no-brainer.
B00DQ8GDV8|4.0|Some parts of it are really technical and can be a bit annoying and repetitive, but it really explains our human history.
6304698798|5.0|Best cowboy movie ever !  Great plot, acting, cinematography, and music.  This is one you will watch over and over again.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|In my opinion, The Divergent Series was by far the best book I have  read in a very long time. It continues to make you wish for more and gives you every expectation you want. It's romantic,comedic, and bold all in one. I would recommend this book to anyone with a devoted heart and a seek for pleasure. This book will really change how you feel and your true perspective on what real bravery is.<br /><br />*spoiler alert on ending*<br /><br />Unlike most people who read the book, I very much respected the ending that Veronica chose. Tris went through the whole 3 books, struggling with her identity and how to balance her selflessness with her bravery. With her experiences she realized that selflessness isn't dieing for no reason which she attempted a couple of times. It's succeeding in an act for someone you love and not caring about how it may result for you. She showed her selflessness by taking her brothers place in his suicide mission. She then also showed her strength and bravery by dieing  for what she believed in and facing it head on! It may not have been the ending you wanted, but ultimately it was  the most honest and genuine ending that Roth could have written. It sums up Beatris' struggles and it showed how she overcame all of her obstacles and attained her goal. To end my statement; The Divergent Series has a beautiful ending and I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be moved.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|Helps you to understand what exactly happened when the bottom fell out in 2007/2008.  It clearly presents how the American people were duped and many fell into the trap and could not get out without loss of lot of money.  For many it was their entire retirement.  Its a good one to see to know how watchful we must be in these crazy times.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I sure like the new look. This makes it fun for me and easy enough for my grandchildren to find out the temperature and the forecast for the day
B004X75RK4|5.0|I can watch that movie back to back to back. I just love it. its funny, and clean. my husband likes it too.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I don't care what the other reviewers say...I thought this book was really good! Lots of action, some thinking, and a good ending. I will be reading the next book very soon!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The fact that I don't need to replace a perfectly good HD television to make it 'internet ready' is great.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|I'm an avid hiker, so I often found this tale of an unprepared person setting out to hike the Pacific Crest Trail frustrating, and at times I was muttering \\"What a fool...\\" However, the author's stated reasons for hiking were more to find herself and overcome grief than to enjoy the wilderness, and tales of overcoming personal adversity are always interesting. This is a well written story, and although she didn't express it in the book, I assume the author found a love of wild places and appreciation for all of nature's beauty during her journey.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this game, it's my favorite game to play, I'm so addicted to this game, it's the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
076780421X|5.0|Fools rush in is such a god movie with Matthew Perry as he is such a wonderful actor. I feel he can adjust to any role he would play
B0058YPLA2|5.0|This is a great show.  It is not your average fairy tale.  It provides a great hour escape from boring life.
B006GLT8FK|5.0|a great movie to follow in the path of the Whole nine yards. Great sequel to it. superb acting on all parts.
B00555X8OA|4.0|A brilliant book - which the author tries to make understandable, but some of it is challenging reading.  It took a while but was most rewarding .
B000WGWQG8|4.0|This series is very addicting and interesting but very slow moving and LONG. Dont watch it unless you have time to spare.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|Easy read, well written, not too many characters, good story line. Also wanted to read the sequel to Something Borrowed.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Super story teller that keeps you hooked and hooked, and hooked.  The Knight Errant rides again and the bad guys are very bad but in trouble.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Riveting plot.  Characters who begin to feel like you know them as real individuals, beautifully written. I love the fact that Suzanne Collins books are not predictable.
0385351399|1.0|I'm a huge Debbie Downer on social media. So in theory I should be praising this book instantly, right?<br /><br />Unfortunately I just can't when the story rests in the hands of an extremely dim-witted protagonist. I gave up after her third out of the blue sexual encounter with someone, all before she'd raised so much as a single objection to the obvious evils in the initiatives at her new mega company.<br /><br />I mean it's a book about privacy violation and she endures about 100 of them, and witnesses plenty of top secret up and coming ones with \\"oh okay!\\" aplomb by that point.<br /><br />I couldn't read the whole book. The only times I was moved by beautiful lucid prose were a few descriptions of kayaking scenes. He should write a whole book about kayaking. The rest is fake jargon about a fake tech company, that's as cringeworthy as you'd expect the real stuff to be. That doesn't mean you want to read lots of it though.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars for the concept of not giving up your privacy rights... if that had come up by the time I was more than half way through.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Seems I'm equally drawn to mystery novels as to stories about children with difficult lives. Having read a couple of other &#34;orphan train&#34; stories, I have to admit I'm hooked on these stories....due in a great part to the fact that although the stories are fiction, the orphan trains truly did exist and the fictional experiences aren't necessarily very different from the actual experiences of the children on those trains. This was another almost impossible to set down book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book is fantastic! I can not put it down. I am not a huge Stephen King fan but love the movie the Shining and this book is great!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really appreciate a calculator with large print and made for simple calculations of every day use and made for my Kindle Fire.  It is one of the applications I use frequently.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Michael Fassbender lovers buy this one ! He is sublime in the alien interpretation. I actually love the guy in every movie he does.
0786958731|5.0|Great game, good design, great miniatures, and great self storage!  Very fun to play and useful in other games as well. I recommend ultra pro pro-fit sleeves for the cards. Fit great and still fit in the card slots.
B006RUJST6|4.0|I could not put this book down - not for one second - I'm hooked!!!!!<br />Layken and Will meet the first day she moves into the house across from his. There is an immediate and strong attraction and they are &#34;slammed&#34; together, but then the realities of life get in the way and they are ripped apart.<br />This book is young adult fiction and the story is exciting, sweet, sad, frustrating, and gripping all at once. I laughed a little and even cried a few times.
B0030B811Q|5.0|Funny as hell, I heard it was a great movie and it lived up to the hype. A must see.
B0084HJE0S|1.0|This is more like a quick overview of the web technologies rather than a useful book about using the technology. I was looking for something more technical to help with web programming.
B009EJSQ3G|5.0|I debated whether to give this Abba album 4 or 5 stars. I decided on 5 because every time I play this album I feel so good about the music and it makes me smile a lot:)  It's not perfect. But, it IS full of wonderful songs as  Abba continues to find their musical identity. So here goes....<br /><br />1. Mamma Mia - A classic pop song. One of their most famous hits. The title became the name of the stage musical and eventual movie starring Meryl Streep. Classic, catchy pop song with terrific vocals from Agnetha and Frida.<br /><br />2. Hey, Hey Helen  -  This song seems to be about a woman torn between her conventional role as a wife/mother and wanting to find her independence. It's ok. Not my favorite.<br /><br />3. Tropical Loveland - My least favorite song from this album. The melody is decent. Frida does a fine job with what she's got to work with. But, a dull song with cliche lyrics with a tropical sound. I am surprised this is the only real solo song for Frida on the album.<br /><br />4. S.O.S.  - Now, we have Abba's first real masterpiece. Excellent production. Agnetha's vocals are so vulnerable and pure. You feel her pain. Perhaps, my favorite Abba song of all time. But, maybe not. There's so many of them;)<br /><br />5. Man in the Middle  - I really dig this song. Has a funky sound. About a wealthy man who is really empty inside.<br /><br />6 - Bang-A-Boomerang  - It's funny. This song along with Rock Me and So Long are simple, almost bubble gum songs. But, are so fun and melodic they make the experience of this album all the more enjoyable!<br /><br />7. - I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do  - A wonderful memory song for me. It always played at the ice rink when I was young and my mom would take my sister and I skating. It was a brand new hit back then. Great tune, the saxes, and incredible vocals from the girls.<br /><br />8. Rock Me. Bjorn does a decent job at lead on this rocker. The song is fun and you can't help but sing along to it.<br /><br />9. Intermezzo- I love this instrumental. Actually, very sophisticated for a pop song. Full of melodic and experimental passages.<br /><br />10 . I've Been Waiting For You -  One of my favorites from the album. Agnetha has grown so much as a singer throughout the years  But, back here, she is young....almost naive... declaring her devotion to that special someone. She has such an angelic, clear voice on this song and became part of why Agnetha is my favorite member of the group. This song has a bit of a country/pop feel to it.<br /><br />11. So Long -  Great rocker! Frantic and full of energy.<br /><br />12. Crazy World  -  I still struggle to embrace Bjorn as a lead singer. But, this song was so well written and recorded. About a guy with \\"trust issues\\" lol<br /><br />13 -  Bonus Medley - Pick a Bale of Cotton - On Top of Old Smokey  - Midnight Special  - I could have done without this. Kind of interesting. Frida does a great job with On Top of Old Smokey and Agnetha rocks out to the Midnight Special<br /><br />So, I highly recommend this album for people interested in Abba and to all lovers of fine pop music.
0142420891|4.0|Gifted paperback that's been collecting dust on my shelf for ages<br /><br />Okay, so it became quickly apparent when I started this that it didn't really go with the Halloween theme. I was already into it though, so I figured I'd just go with it. I guess it could be considered scary in a way.<br /><br />Take for instance, it could actually happen. Unlike vampire or werewolves, this was real. There are car accident's every day and the reality is... not everyone make it out alive. That's what really drove this story home for me.<br /><br />It's told from Mia's point of view while she's watching everything going on around her. It is freaking heart breaking. I cannot imagine.<br /><br />I felt it was a little slow at times though. There are a lot of flashbacks showing you how her life was before the accident. All of these things are definitely key to the story, and getting a feel for who she really is.<br /><br />If I Stay is written beautifully and even though it didn't pack a spooky punch, I am still very glad that I finally got a chance to pull it off the shelf and give it a try.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I tried to start away from the light, but when candy crush saga came available on my Kindle I couldn't help but download it to see what all the fuss was about!  Now I'm hooked like a fish!  Love it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game! I really enjoy this game even though some levels are very fun. I recommend this game for others to play.
B001AUKUTU|4.0|Great rocking album. 3 and a half starts probably if I could rate it that way, but this is damn good. Every track is rocking and a lot of the guitar work is reminiscent of Deep Purple. That's definitely a good thing. Pretty kicking album overall.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't usually play games but my friend suggested that I download Candy Crush.  This is a totally addictive game and I am glad I got it.
B00A757EFW|4.0|It's Pac man he's back I know you guys r happy I am to but the controls r not good maybe y'all should go and fix the controls if u do I would give u five stars
B00C8YOIR2|5.0|This was a refreshing and humorous take on death, life, and everything in between.  Peter John deftly balances the black comedic tone, which is one of the most difficult to manage.  Bravo on a superior story that will keep you chuckling throughout!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is the best game ever, I am always looking for it in my choice bar. It is a good game for kids and adults. This game is a great opportunity for fun.
B001JYEMOQ|4.0|It was a very entertaining movie.  I liked it but didn't love it!....however it was always interesting to see how he would get out of his many situations!!!!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|though it was a very good game like the site line and really like the company that makes these game's.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book.  I am impressed with this author.  A big fan of the genre, I know I have to suspend disbelief often for these types of stories and just brave myself for wide, gaping loopholes.  This book was so well thought out that I found myself believing it could really happen.  The author seems to have thought of everything in this futuristic society. No pitiful leaps in logic or character motivation.  In fact, all the characters are fleshed out nicely.  I ended up reading the entire series of Wool, Shift, and Dust.  The subsequent books pull everything together and explain more of the history of the silos, but you can still read Wool as stand alone book and be very satisfied with it.  These books had me thinking for days of the ramifications, possibilities, and so many other questions posed in the book.  This is how I know a book is worth recommending--- I can't stop thinking about even long after I have turned the last page.
B00472NZDQ|4.0|Great read but not his best. Still a superb page turner! Hoping will get more of the deadly duo. Loved it.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I was hooked from beginning to end and what an end it was!  No detail is insignificant! You will want to re-read this one.
B00D1VKZ3M|4.0|I was keen to revisit Bridget snd see where life had led her.<br />I did not mind that Mark was not playing a big part anymore but I was suprised by how old she was supposed to be. Wasn't she early 30s previously? Are we supposed to think that they waited years fo start a family?<br />Apart from that, which  I found difficult to reconcile, the story was another trip into Bridgets world and there were a few laugh out loud moments.<br />The quality of the Kindel version was a bit disapointing. A few obvious mistakes such as large gaps in sentences and the email printing  with Billy's letter are a few examples of poor translatin  to Kindel and were dicficult to see. I am disappointed that a product, which is published by so called professional pulishing houses can get away with mistakes while amature self publishers are criticised.fv
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I read this book cover to cover in two days!  The writer engages the reader so effortlessly!  I felt each characters emotions!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|When I heard that there was a sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34; in the works, I wasn't thrilled.  I was afraid that one of the best horror stories I've ever read would somehow be diminished by a follow up so many years later, even if written by my favorite author.  But because it's Stephen King, I had to buy it ... and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I'm not going into any specifics about the story itself, as that will only take away from the reader's experience.  It's Stephen King, he's still at the top of his game, and at the end of the day, he scared me and he pulled at my emotions.  King's ability to find that one millimeter of exposed nerve and write just to the edge of it is still as sharp as ever.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Overall good game. Same as on my phone, just bigger screen. Need distraction, then this is it.  Download it now. Have fun.
B0068OXAM2|5.0|I guess I've been out of high school long enough that much of the subject matter didn't feel like reminders.This book teaches the basics so well you really need no formal training as a prerequisite. I'm studying to take the GMAT and math wasn't my strongest skill and now I'm  much more confident now and I have about 2 months to get proficient. In summary, a useful and great book.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Excellent, well written drama that engages the viewer with great character portrayals and intriguing plot lines.  The ongoing story line meshes neatly with the events of the individual episodes to weave an engrossing bit of story telling.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Kept you turning pages - wife runs from abusive husband similar to Sleeping With the Enemy but falls in love with widowed father - suspenseful and heartwarming with a couple of twists - thoroughly enjoyed
B00G0PCGIS|5.0|While containing many moments that remind one of previous Metal Church songs the new CD has one great song after another and does expand on past efforts in many areas.That`s what kept it interesting to me.All the guys sound great on this one.It a good sounding CD production wise it has what I like to hear. I was skeptical of the new lead guitar guy Rick but he plays and sounds great.Solid songwriting and classic Kurdt riffing = trademark MC sound.The thing I love about Kurdt`s playing is the solid rhythm parts always have these tasty little single note type fills between them and you instantly know it`s Kurdt.He does have a tone and style of his own. Jeff and Steve sound great also and you can hear some of Steve`s background vocals on a few of them ,nice touch.Jeff`s drums sound really big and chunky. Ronny is the best MC vocalist of all and I was a big Wayne fan.Ronny`s vocals really hold together several songs. Popped on my Grado headphones and gave it a real listen and found each song I heard competing to be my favorite.Cd ends real strong with the last two tracks.A very solid metal album every one should buy.
1419701533|5.0|Our grandson loved the set, perfect for his birthday gift! Had one of the books and had asked for more, usually doesn't enjoy reading
B005MMY9A8|3.0|This was a good movie...  Acting could have been a little better.  I was impressed with the special effects Thanks
B007J4T2G8|5.0|loved this book the first time i read it & even more the second time. sensual and passionate but also sweet and humorous.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great. Keeps me entertained for hours that I should probably be spending working. Addictive it definitely is.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|The movie was full of action, and gave us a different slant on what the zombie apocalypse will look like. The hardest part about getting ready for the zombie apocalypse..... pretending that I'm not excited.Loved this movie. It was edge of the seat viewing all the way. Only wish I could have seen it in 3D. That would have been awesome.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was so excited for this book, and now I'm just crushed. I didn't really like how the book started out, kind of slow and building unnecessary drama between Tris and Four and then to kill Tris off in the end?!?!? Major bummer, I can't help it, I like happy endings and this trilogy does NOT have a happy ending....  :(
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A good read, but I preferred the first two books in the series.  The background given at the end was a nice finishing touch.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|Good addition to the franchise. Enjoyed the movie - pure entertainment. I do not want to spoil for others. A bit of  a plot twist if you're a fan of the comic.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|[[ASIN:006202406X Allegiant (Divergent)]]<br /><br />I realize this a YA book, most are not expecting to be engrossed in fine literature.  In the same vein, it is YA book, so why such a disappointing ending?<br /><br />I have read several of the reviews and here is one from another disappointed reader (Dianna) that sums it up quite well:<br /><br />Outline:<br />a. Tragically Ironic Death: Kill off Tori, only to find out pages later that her previously thought dead brother<br />was actually alive<br />b. Pointless Death of Very Likeable Character: Uriah<br />c. Pointless Death of Main Character: Tris<br />d. Leave 2nd Main Character Sad & Alone: Tobias<br />e. Let All The Worst Liked Characters Live: Tobias's Mom, Tobias's Dad, Tris's Brother, etc, etc<br /><br />This is the last of Roth's books I will read that I will have to pay for.  Hopefully Divergent will do well at the box office.  Shailene Woodley is a promising young actress and perhaps can bring people in even though they know their beloved character is dead.
B000I9YXKG|5.0|It has always been one of my most favorite love stories. I also love the music in the movie and the scenery in France is wonderful
B004SIIBGU|5.0|i love this. the real time bid count down durring the last hour of the bid works better than the ebay web site.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I recommend this to anyone who is having second thoughts about getting it is beautiful love it I would give it 10 stars if I could
B003H4I4JU|1.0|Piggies, Pipo and Libo...those well thought out names about say it all.<br /><br />Garbage - that says the rest.<br /><br />Also...a Catholic Brazilian colony? Seriously, give me a break, what is this the 16th century?!<br />Dances With Wolves and Avatar on low quality meth. I'd give it more than one star but its high rating needs to be knocked down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. The story is so unique and captivating. I couldn't put it down and instantly ordered the next book the moment I finished this one.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The song makes me happy it really makes me move. You need to check out the music video to the song too nice girls :)
B00DV3A84G|5.0|No wonder Bastille's Bad Blood went to the top of the charts in England. They are a great band and I went to their show in Portland, Oregon.
B0098VXE50|4.0|I have watched this movie a couple of times. May watch it again when I'm in the fantasy mood.  Well done
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Probably their best from start to finish, the drumming is top notch and tight and the solos are perfect!!!!<br />The rebirth of Dream Theater
B008602KQI|5.0|I've watched it 4 times.  Exciting.  I have read the trilogy twice.The movie is quite close to the story line.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cool! You should really buy it. It does have stuff that you have to pay for yourself though
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My grandson loves it. He loves the planes, he loves the mazes, he just loves Dr. Panda! I was amazed at how fast he picked up on the maze portion of the game, something I couldn't get him to do with pencil and paper.
0385360169|1.0|In my opinion, this was a terrible book. Worst book I ever read. I very much wanted to be interested in the story, but I simply could not get past the absolutely HORRIBLE writing. I cannot believe this book got published in its current form. It sounded like it was written by an illiterate 13 year old. I found the sex laughable, rather than erotic. The worst part about this book is the author's repetition of lame words and phrases such as 'Oh My', and 'I bit my lip', and 'I flushed', 'I blushed scarlet', 'his mouth was a hard line',  and on and on they went...... the main character Anastasia uttered these phrases what seemed like hundreds of times throughout the first book. It was maddening to read. I stopped about half way through, because to continue would have been torturous. There are too many wonderful books out there to waste time on trash like this. I cannot believe this became so popular. I mean no offense to people who loved this book, as everybody has their own opinions. But to me, this ranks up there with one of the worst, most terribly written books of all time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|About time there was an edition made for Kindle! Makes the addiction so much easier since I don't have an iphone!
B0092MJOMW|1.0|This album and band is just boring come on people what's with all these bands and the satanic lyric's and anti this and anti that I mean please this is extreme yeah more like a bad soap opera. Please people stop listening to bands that suck and listen to pop or something with nice lyric's instead of vulgar and much worse stuff in their lyrics.<br /><br />all n all a lame album and band<br /><br />SLAYER equals BORING!!!!!!!!
B0033G9OFA|4.0|Pretty cool, has the Ed Sullivan appearance mastered to CD. Also, my favorite Jim Morrison sound byte is on here, about people trying to be funny vs trying to be serious. Such a brilliantly weird viewpoint.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This the greatest game ever .and I love it.it's great for my kindle and I hope you like it .I think it's a five star game.
B0011U8NZ2|4.0|This is pretty good quality. One special part is the rendition of When the Musics Over, with spooky merge into and out of Break On Through right in the middle. Way cool.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This is a pretty cool app. I mean, like the tablet doesn't have a video camera which sucks but this app is cool. What kinda gets me annoyed is when it keeps closing.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|A mystery program with a sense of humor and a cast that can carry it off. Oh, and the continuing villains take a back seat.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It works great I love this app it's so relaxing<br />My girls fall asleep fast with it to I definitely recommend getting it. It helps calm your nerves to :)
0553381695|5.0|ILove the book. It is a great story, and a great series. I like the style in which it is written. It arrived fast.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Only wish is for offline reading mode - otherwise a great app for keeping up-to-date on what's happening in the Rss universe.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|This app has everything you need in an art program. I am using it on my Galaxy note 10.1 tablet. Very good integration to an android app from the PC version.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|A truly multi layered story. Personal tragedy, intrigue, and a very different take on the Cold War. Perhaps weare not always as good as we think we are.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is crack. If you like crack then play this game. Better connected to Facebook so friends can send life's and extra moves in times of need
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|One of those books that you need to remember when reading in public not to gasp out loud. Best read in a while.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|The writing is very good but this book is too long, the descriptions are to long, everything is too long; ended being depressed and took me to a dark place; I had to skip last 2 or 3 chapters as I was tired of skimming through the pages and with a kindle reader, it was taking forever. I could have handle all the negativity, bad luck, stupidity etc but did not understand why the main character did not return the painting with the ring, that made no sense to me.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A good story that slowly unfolds and engages the reader....surprisingly good read... And certainly a fast one. I would read more bt this author
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I like the story line, but it was bit hard to read due to changing perspectives between Tris and Four. This distracted somehow from the storyline.
B009AVCAJ4|5.0|tha bomb s***. if you havent seen it you need to cause it all that and then some.check it out.
B00EDX5QNG|4.0|Debut from New York duo who play narco-hypnotic & bluesy interplanetary trip-hop chill with<br /> haunted atmospheric strains of Prince-like disco/funk over a drifty, druggy, liquid flow of down-<br /> low, beat-driven Spiritualized mantra-rhythmic writhing.  They unveil dark, breathy floats of<br /> ecstasy that gently mutate and evolve with a supple twist from snake-like, slow-burn Shackleton<br /> electro-funk to restrained & manipulated hints of Dire Straits/Stone Roses guitar riffs—all the<br /> while searching for the soul of Love & Rockets.  The epic beauty here is smoothed by the<br /> decadent stroke of serene, sensual pump percussion; then subtly disturbed by clanging industrial<br /> background sounds.  The production is immaculately creepy, stunningly deep & clean.  This is an<br /> album that begs to be listened to on a good stereo system.  Hand-clap club beats are aimed<br /> directly at the slow-grind techno center of the hips.  “Psychic” is a dark and undeniably sexy<br /> album.  It’s no accident that two of its biggest influences are Portishead  & Pigeonhed.  You’ll<br /> want to turn the volume up high and the lights down low for this one.  An ultimate dreamy, chill<br /> out moment for 2013.
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|This was how I was dressed for Halloween. Serious BB fan. I had the pork pie hat and all but Walter's signature Wallabee shoes and the gun(no meth or money either;))
B00DMEQP46|5.0|3rd release from Connecticut band—dreamy, playful, interplanetary psychedelic pop with a<br /> creamy, mellifluous center of experimental noise sounds.  The songs have a mysteriously<br /> haunted, cogent alien softness, as though they were constructed on a world where harmony and<br /> dischord float hand-in-hand above the sway of rainbow poppy fields.  There’s a strong sense of<br /> 60s influenced sound manipulation, a trippy & melodic lava flow that has the added deep sparkle<br /> of modern electronic production techniques.  It’s a friendly listen, but only comfortable if heard<br /> with an unconstrained brain-ear.  The songs aren’t particularly hummable, but they exude an<br /> oddly inviting warmth.  Recalls bands like Tame Impala, Mercury Rev, Medicine, Pond, Flaming<br /> Lips, Secret Machines, Robyn Hitchcock, the Black Angels.  “MGMT” is a magnificent<br /> headphone album of yummy acid bliss pop.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Does what is needed.<br />Nice and big so I can see.<br />Easy to use and always available without any down time
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very addicting! Just got it and had to play it 14 times in a row before I could just go to the menu!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OMFG. I was so happy I was twerking when candy crush came out for kindle fire. this is my game right here!!!!!!!! and its soliloquy addicting too!!! thanks amazon!!!! I'm so happy!!!! :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm enjoying this game and the various levels.  Challenging enough to keep me coming back for more even after repeatedly failing a level.  Very satisfying to pass the harder levels!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|it got hung up once but other than that it was a great game. it was well worth the money.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great series, very addictive.  Once you start you'll never want to stop.  I love this series!  So will you too!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great convenience! I had been waiting for something like this for a while. It's a great helping tool. Good to have near by.
B008V8FVTI|5.0|This move was disturbing, hard to watch, but very good.  Not for everybody. If you are sensitive don't watch but if you can watch it is totally engrossing.
B003Y059EK|4.0|I have Loved this movie since I was a kid!  I Just watched it with my daughter and she too loved it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game glad it now on kindle. I can play it on all my devices. Got my whole family playing.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|Maggie certainly lead an interesting life with murder, lies and mayhem mixed in. When her wayward sister was found she traveled to identify the body. But was it really her sister?
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book has taught me to be more aware of people and situations that seem out of the ordinary. If something doesn't feel right, check it out.<br />I found the chapters on Jaycee's therapy especially inspiring. Her childhood was stolen, but she has reclaimed her life! What an inspiration!
1250038820|4.0|Awesome pictures. Just wish it had more writing. great quality what else can you complain about. dont expect much from a picture book
B00881VLCE|2.0|have been using for a while,  had a update and now won 't work anymore. unistalled and installed,  will not work. contacted amazon,  no help. ximad has not gotten back to me.  I am very sad,  I loved this game.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|Just time to say GOOD BYE to the MIB, OK? Its like seeing a billboard with a sign like: &#34;Rocky 200&#34; Come on Hollywood, get some new blood in the writers group and stop picking form Union writers.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simple and effective. Does the job. Which it would support VPN but there are ways to get around this within your local home network so no big deal. For the price it's a steal and the future.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|A very different presentation of the life of Jesus. We have been overdosed on Catholicism but rarely has anyone presented the times in which he lived as Aslan has done. We have heard that the gospels were written long after his death but this is the clearest picture of that I've ever read. I would recommend it to any modern day zealot but it's likely they would see the author, of Muslim parents, as a blasphemer. Too bad.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I like the option of solving puzzles instead of being required to do them in order to progress. Challenging and fun but Energy used up too quickly. Otherwise good game.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|It was intriguing; I liked the strong female characters and I loved the ending. I didn't care for the French language, though.
B003K15IF8|5.0|Beautifully written. A story as simple as any, yet as deep as any ever told due to Williams' insightful observation of humanity.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy to finally have Candy Crush Saga on my Kindle Fire!!!  I don't know what took so long, but the app works just fine.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|A story I had never heard. Deep and harrowing look at war, West Africa, family and survival. A story that must be read and never forgotten.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I read Divergent and I had serious problems with her world building ever since, but still, I tried to give this book a chance, I really did. It took me weeks to finish this book. Yes, I read spoilers, and I read the ending first. However, like many of the reviewers here, the ending is the least problematic thing in this series.<br /><br />- Roth tells, not shows. And she don't just tell, she over tells. She's describe one thing and tell us what it means. Many times I find myself saying: ok Roth, we get what you are saying with this visual, no need to spell it out completely for your readers, we are not stupid.<br /><br />- the dual POV just didn't work. Tobias and Tris sounded the same, and I felt that the Tobias chapters didn't contribute anything to the narrative, especially when Roth was going to just repeat them or give the cliffs notes version in Tris' chapter.<br /><br />- the deconstruction of Tobias' character. It's like he is a different character all together. Yes, he had an insecure side and damaged by his past, but he didn't miss the chance to remind us of it in every other sentence. And characterization wise, that's he only side of him Roth focused on.<br /><br />- Tris was too one-dimensional. Her character didn't really grow in this book, and Roth employed the strong female character stereotypes on her, and not in a good way. And the way she rationalizes things are so out of the left field that I wonder if she really believes what she's saying. SHE WAS VERY PREACHY TOO.<br /><br />- all the secondary characters were boring, hard to tell them apart, and all the new characters were simply plot devices.<br /><br />- Roth just dropped the main plot in the first two books without resolving them and just created a whole new convoluted world. Her long-build up from the first two books for what it means to be Divergent was anti-climatic and well, stupid. The science of it is not even acceptable for sci-fi novel type of science.<br /><br />When she explained in her mtv interview that she can't find the science for what she want Divergent to mean because all of her characters would have been considered Divergent also, I was like duh, not surprised. That's what I've been saying since the first book, the divergent concept and the faction system doesn't make sense since anyone in Chicago could be divergent. And then when she further explained divergence doesn't mean anything at all, well so much for Tris being a special snowflake that she build her up to be.<br /><br />I get the racism allegory that she was going for, but she failed to achieve it. In fact, Tris only seemed racist and that the issue of GDs only affected her when she learned the bureau killed her parents. And did she invoke the WHITE SAVIOR TROPE in this allegory! Tris, the super GP that will save the GDs.<br /><br />- The relationship between Tris and Tobias is so unhealthy and borderline abusive. Yes couples fight and make up all the time, but if they were my best friends, I would have told them to break up a long time ago. And idk why Roth really thought it was necessary to kill Uriah so that they could have another thing to fight about that will almost break them apart but end up in them having their first time to be make-up sex (which I laughed when I read the last paragraph of that scene, coz Tris was hell bent on romanticizing that moment but she clearly was in pain and didn't really enjoy it).<br /><br />-And Tris' plan to take down the bureau that everyone agreed to without much deliberation? All the reasoning the characters did in the scene just made me go wtf every time. I feel like I'm watching a horror movie where all the characters were just agreeing to do something incredibly stupid but no one was questioning it or offering alternative solutions.<br /><br />- The ending has been discussed to death (pun intended), so I'm not going to repeat them here. But all I'm going to say is the way Roth explained in her blog of how she has been setting up Tris to sacrifice herself at the right time and as a way to honor her parents made me find Roth's logic behind self-sacrifice, bravery, and selflessness to be very problematic. She basically romanticized suicide, since Tris' sacrifice accomplished nothing except justifying some poorly rationalized moral lessons.<br /><br />Needless to say, if Roth ever wants to write YA or anything ever again, get better editors coz this book read like a self-published book (which is an insult to self-published authors coz i've read better self-published work than this).
B001D8W7CW|4.0|I love Stephen King books and this movie and its cast mimics the suspense and feelings of the book wonderfully!
B008ADUHKW|4.0|Subtle but intense characterisations, the commonplace made exceptional.<br />While presented in a matter of fact way the writing draws in the reader to understand the central character.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Great read! I love the whole series!! Can't wait for the 9th book to come out!! Love it soo much!!
B004T4F7TW|5.0|One of my favorite all time albums front to back, if you like New Orleans blues, this is for you!  Or, if you don't, this album is still for you!  When I got this, I picked it up due to how well it was doing sales-wise.  When I first saw it at Target for sale, it was sold out.  Yes, a blues album sold out.  I'm sure that it didn't hurt that he had the #1 TV show at the time, but hey, I picked it up and I'm glad I did!  I'm also into Chicago blues a lot.... if the track isn't electrified or in most cases has harmonica in it, I didn't like it, so I was also on the fence due to that.  Hugh really has something special here..... the tracks are lovingly selected, the execution and arrangement are top shelf, and they are rich and amazing musicially.  Check out St. James Infirmary, You Don't Know My Mind, Buddy Bolden's Blues and/or Tipitina if you are on the fence about this.  Oh yeah, Dr. John, Tom Jones and Erma Thomas have guest spots on it.... check it out already!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Loved it, Star Trek true, if you're a real Trekkie. Plus great actors and awesome effects, overall, great movie :)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Awesome book. A page turner you can't put down. Loved the way the author kept me guessing. The ending was a shocker.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Fun little puzzle game. The graphics are great and colorful. It's one of those games you can play for hours, like Angry Birds.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Truly laugh out loud funny. This book is great for anyone looking for some honest comedy with a twinge of feminism.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read the first short story that started this all off. It was good,but not great, however I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. The story gets better as you progress. By the end I was hooked. I think this series is a worth while read.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|The kids like it. It kills time in the Dr 's lobby. Quite puzzle game. Not too violent for my kids. There not too young. Not good for the very young.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I've been a fan of Grisham since the beginning & this was one of my favorites. The familiar characters were as colorful & enjoyable as in A Time To Kill.  I highly recommend it!
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Exactly what I expected....the product is well re-mastered and the content is unedited. I would prefer fewer ads at the beginning of the DVD, but all re other BBC productions.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is so fun.<br />Good game.<br />I love playing this game in my spare time.<br />You should get this game if you love having fun.:)
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have had many email programs & many have closed.  I have a premium acct ($19.00/mo) and a couple non=premium.  They are easy to manage & Yahoo usually keeps software up to date.  I had a web based program but it was cumbersome to keep aligned with pop & img.  My secondary/backup is gmail for informational purposes.
0064431789|5.0|I love this book, my first, second, third, and well all of my elementary school teachers have read this book to me! I absolutely love the book and the movie! I love you Maurice Sendak!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Best novel I've read in a long time, riviting story that kept me at the edge of my seat to the very end. The characters were amazing and story line unexpected. First experience reading a novel about N.Korea it was bone chilling to think it could remotely resemble what life is actually like in that country.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the idea of making a minion game and its so cool seeing them in there world and the minions are so cute
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fabulous story. Didn't think I liked that period in film, but I love it. Anyone would. The story just has you glued to the screen. Went through all three seasons in less than a week and now I just feel empty. NEED season 4 as soon as possible. Done brilliantly! Bravo.
1936891026|5.0|Well written and a quick read. Just the sort of book every artist or person endeavoring to start something new should read.
B00C1S945G|5.0|Patrick Stewart leads an ensemble cast of very able actors and draws you in a welling suspension of disbelief. I watched the show in reruns as a teen and I was enthralled by it.  I rediscovered the show thanks to Amazon prime, and I find even more entertaining and thought provoking.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game I recommend it for anyone<br /><br />I just love it lol<br />I hope u do its great terrific<br />Fantastic
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am an avid science fiction reader and search for stories that aren't narrative, but create a setting in which I become a part. Hugh Howey succeeds in Wool. I am spending my reading time with Shift and Dust.
B001B6PBBK|4.0|A very well matched ensemble to tell  what is becoming a timeless, albeit very modern, story. It's always tough to find love. For many, the only descriptions of love and how to find it are heterosexual. In this movie we learn that the nuances of finding love are unique to each of us as individuals, to our humanity, not to our sexual orientation.
B001GCUO16|5.0|Loved it!  My favorite of all the X-Men movies so far.  Very interesting back story on how the Wolverine became the Wolverine.  Even better I think than the original story in the comic book.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|The Rosie Project is an absolutely delightful book. I found myself laughing out loud at some points and crying at others. The author does a wonderful job of taking us into the mind and heart of a person with Aspergers, sharing the ups and downs of his emotional (or unemotional) journey in finding a wife. Excellent, well written story!
B006L4MX0Y|3.0|Better than the Americanized version. Worth watching once maybe twice.  I would probably rent it over purchasing it if I had to do it again.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I'm still getting acquainted with this app.  I'm having trouble moving from one book to another.  Would appreciate better directions.
B000Q66JXA|5.0|One of the better fantasy movies made.  A must own for any collection. Great movie that will probably be overlooked by the younger generation.
B007AL48UK|3.0|I selected this app in order to become familiar with the game of Mahjong.  I enjoy the app, but would have liked more direction on how to play the game.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|If you're looking at it then you know you're a fan. Go ahead and buy it. It's nice to watch both old and new graphics.
B008S80OU2|5.0|Five stars? Definitely! You get all of the classic BOC albums/discs, remastered, and it all comes in an acceptable package. My only complaint would revolve around the individual card board sleeves. To keep the cost down, this method of packaging was probably the best option to provide mini replicas of the album covers; however, taking the discs out of the sleeves can be awkward. I still wouldn't hesitate to buy this set again knowing about the sleeves. The book and rarities disc are a nice touch as well.
B00180R06I|2.0|I'm a sucker* for a good vampire movie.  Regardless of how classic this movie is suppose to be, I'd rather watch Nosferatu 3 times in a row than suffer though this again.
B00C2IPB66|5.0|Sometimes movies that receive a lot of praise age poorly and years later you can't understand how it garnered such praise. Gladiator is not one of those movies. Powerful storytelling, beautiful sets that are stunningly realistic, and outstanding performances create a modern classic. The collectible Steelbook packaging is a cherry on top.
B0051T47NQ|4.0|This movie was way better than expected.  Ending was a little bit of a let down but not to much. This a hidden gem of a movie.
B0034G4OYA|3.0|This movie was fine but isn't something I would want to watch again and my 7 year old son didn't like it much.  This came out in theaters at about the same time as &#34;Wreck it Ralph&#34; and that movie is much better.  This is really more of a movie to catch on TV and not own.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Awful movie.  Even for Sci-Fi it pushes the envelope. Not to mention it just sucks as a prequel ( even if people say it isn't a prequel )
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I normally don't read these kind of books but this one held my interest. I highly recommend it. Sometimes made me laugh.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|I had both 1 and 3 but this shouldn't cost as much as it does. 1 and 3 we better movies also.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|VERY Interesting I Love This Game,It Needed To Be Longer. As I played The Game It Became Even More Challenging.
0744014956|2.0|I've found more hidden content and reference online. IMHO books like this, especially Limited Editions, should have ALL hidden content and Easter eggs.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Wish there were more levels. I could only go up to level 10. Looking for more games that are similar.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome!  It provides hours and hours of fun.  It's my secret addiction at work and on the go.  I love it!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Well thanks for asking I choise this because you get to do makeup and dressup. So that is how I like it so send me a email and tell me why you like it and I will tell you if I like it or if I don't I guess it's a MYSERY!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|WONDERFUL GAME! My Granddaughter and I enjoy this game all the time,<br />(I must admit I play all the time, she`s only 8 months ;) it's FUN!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addicting!  I see bright sliding candies when I close my eyes!  The game quickly escalates from easy to challenging, then chaing modes into &quot;pay by level&quot;.  There is still a &quot;once a day&quot; solution though.  This game is ingeniously simple.  Wholesome and perfect for the little ones.  Thank you King!
B00FQRWORE|5.0|Free Spirit: Heart and Soul  by D C Rogers is an exciting read that keeps you turning the pages. The tale begins in  London and moves forward quickly with a voyage to New York to expand our character Alex's, shoe making business. He brings with him his lovely sixteen year old daughter Mary-Ann and they are be-friended while aboard ship by Mr. Ford and his daughter Susan who helps them in this new country of wild gangs and Indians.<br /><br />The description of the voyage and aboard ship along with the desert scene and the mine cave helps the reader picture the world that the author creates. With the help of the Spirit horse Free Spirit, Alex becomes strong after his near-death experience and is trained to go between realms and keep the balance as he spirit walks. This was very creative and well thought out.<br /><br />There is an Indian named Chayton who is a wonderful character and a twist I didn't see coming.<br /><br />I love the Indian folklore and the old west and with a fantasy element thrown in, you have a wonderful story that stands alone but would also be a wonderful series.<br /><br />I received this copy of Free Spirit: Heart and Soul for an honest review and I really liked the story and recommend reading it.
B001EC2ISA|3.0|was a pretty good movie not 1 I'd watch too many times though. Good for a Halloween movie a thon.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This book draws you in.  It is a very clever eye opener into what will happen if societies don't learn to live together.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|The game itself is fun but you could spend a fortune just trying to get to another level.  I have been stuck on level 17 for 2 weeks and I can't get past unless I spend money - this really isn't a free game.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This app keeps force closing. I can't even play. I tried logging in through FB and I tried playing as a guest but nothing works. It just takes me back to my kindle 's home screen. I have played this before and it never happened before. I re installed it today after uninstalling but it stopped working. Fix this and I will give the other 4 start a depending on how I like it.

0307277887|5.0|I watched the whole T.V. series before finding out about the books, and this first book definitely worth it. The book has much more details about what Dexter does and the story in this book, is similar to the 1st season in very brood ways, but a very different story all together. If you are interested in serial killers, it should be a must to buy this book!!! :)

B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Steven Spielberg out does himself in this documentary about the Holocaust.  The film was a block office hit earning over $321 million. The music is dramatic, as are the scenes and acting, earning this film 7 Academy Awards. The film is mostly filmed in Krakow, Poland as Spielberg Chronicles the transformation of Oskar Schindler during one of the worst atrocities to happen to humanity.  This 1993 film is based on the novel \\"Schindler's Ark\\" by Thomas Keneally.  The movie is about the life of Oskar Schindler, a German business man, and how he becomes instrumental in saving the lives of over a 1000 Polish-Jews.<br /><br />The film is artfully done in Black & White, which emphasizes the mood of the times.  The stage is set in Poland, September 1939, when Germany first starts requiring Jews to register with them.  This is just the first step towards the ultimate goal of genocide. The Germans move fast from registration to ousting Jews from their homes in 1940.  The relocation of the Jews to ghettos was just the beginning of the atrocities about to happen to the Jewish people.  The once Jewish owned homes were then given to German officers.<br /><br />Once the Jews were no longer able to own businesses, Schindler sees the opportunity to make money.  Schindler was in good standing in the Nazi party and used bribery and debauchery to get what he wanted.  Schlinder uses Jewish workers in his factory and has to prove that his workers were essential for his business.  If a Jew was deemed non-essential, it was a death sentence.  The Killing of Jews expedited quickly as racial hate took over the German war machine and the genocide of Jews became rampant and unprecedented.<br /><br />Soon the Jews were herded out of the ghettos and forced to death or work camps.  This included Schlinder's Jews, as they were transported to a work camp.  Schlinder had to keep bribing German officials to keep his workers from being exterminated.  It did not take long for people to become aware of the death camps and the gassing of thousands upon thousands of Jewish people. The film is hard to watch at times as the horrors bestowed upon the Jews by the Nazis were disturbing and factual.<br /><br />Schlinder made a list of all of his workers from his factory that he wanted to try to save. Schlinder went to great lengths to try to save between 1100 and 1200 Jews by having them relocated to a village in the Czech Republic, but Schlinder's goal to get his workers out of Poland was almost a disaster. The men and women were separated on different trains and while the men went on to the Czech Republic, the women and children were accidently routed to Auschwitz, the worst death camp.  However, through Schindler's efforts, they were saved from Auschwitz and all made it to the factory in the Czech Republic.<br /><br />Even though Schindler was known as a war profiteer and a womanizer, and while he was motivated by money he still ended up being a hero to hundreds of Jews, humanitarian and savior. This dark, horrific time in world history will not be forgotten, but we should also not forget those people that made a difference.  The hopes of this movie is to shed light on the horrors perpetrated to an entire race of people for future generations to always remember what can happen when hate is allowed to run rampant in the hearts of men and how even one person can change lives, even save lives and make a difference.<br /><br />This movie relates to my World Religion class as it chronicles the hardships that the Jewish people went through during this time of war and genocide.  Around 6 million Jews were killed during this horrific time in world history, in Jewish history.  No one can ever study Judaism without studying the holocaust.  Yet, no one should have to study it, because it should have never happened, but it did, and now we can never forget.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME. I was so scared to play but it's so cool I got it for free but it would be worth the money ,Like it a lot.
B0040UAYI4|3.0|Either the sensitivety is really hard to configure or i have a way to advanced mouse. i use ann razer naga molten edition, which has a uber laser who notice every move and vibration. this might be the reason i have huge problems with the sensitivity of the eagly eye. its almost useless combined with a good gaming mouse.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is a great way to pass the time, and is also a fun way to survive. Best part is to be chased by zombies and creepers into your very own home made hotel! I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did!
0385347774|5.0|This was an intriguing story! Was slow to get into it. I really do not like books that skip back and forth from one person to another, but I am not sure how Gillian Flynn could have pulled off her overall plot without doing so. The ending is a total surprise. I read it for our neighborhood book club. The subject matter and character development made for fantastic discussion.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|When you touch the control stick for the first time, you'll be very glad you spent the money on this brand new game cube controller.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is a challenging game that is well programmed. I'm still in phase one, but I'm really enjoying playing! My son loves it, too!
B00009R86L|5.0|This pad is firm enough to provide the maximum comfort for a heavy messenger bag. But don't expect it to alleviate all the pain of lugging around your laptop and papers! It's secured very well, and can be adjusted pretty easily by sliding it on your strap.
B00FXEL00W|3.0|I bought this book because of its reviews. But ... there are so many buts. It actually was a nice little story but it always felt a little rushed, always trying to built up tension but never going all the way. The main characters Payton and Kendallwere likeable but the spark between them was non existent. I did not feel a connection with the characters, I didn't feel that their story was believable, there was little character development and I didn't really understand how their relationship changed from friendship to being in love. I really wanted to love this story, it had everything in it to be great but for some reason it was just ok.
B000TEMRO4|5.0|Best value for any greatest hits collection and Blondie. Nearly every track was a number one or a favorite. Must have.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Does exactly what it says on the tin.  Allows you to have access to a virutal calculator which works just like a regular calculator
031623480X|5.0|I found Grain Brain makes a lot of sense, although it goes against the AMA party line.  I'm trying to follow the author's advice.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game. Just hate the waiting between lives! Should show our own scores too. And amt of time for each level.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is the Stephen King that wrote The Shining.....I loved it. Thanks for the exciting novel Mr King. Its always nice to tie up loose ends.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|Way better than the stock calendar on my phone. Actually shows what the events ARE when looking in month view as opposed to just showing that I have some event entered in for that day.  Makes it way easier to skim the events for the entire month as opposed to having to look in the week view to see what events are (like in my stock calendar app).
B00D48BSBA|4.0|As usual of Forsyth, vey well researched and an extremely thought-through plot covering recent political incidents. Forsyth should publish more often. Highly recommended.
0385350864|5.0|As much as I've always loved Bridget, she felt like a soulmate in this third installment of her ever- hilarious saga. As a woman of Bridget's age who raised two children alone - with the ADHD she obviously shares - I felt like I was reading about a sister - with an unintentional and ever-present ability to make me laugh. Mad About the Boy is engagingly written and true to the characters. What a beautiful way to wrap things up. If you truly love Bridget just as she is, you'll love this latest offering rom Helen Fielding.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|cool escape app. I enjoy searching afford the tools you need to get out of the room. I like these types of games.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Seriously?! Worst book ever! My friends raved about it. I'm now wondering why I'm friends with them. It's that pathetic. The popularity of this book makes me embarrassed for my entire gender, and a bit worried about the next generation of women... and all of humanity in fact. Role model women throughout history are currently spinning in their graves. This book did change my life in one way. It gave me a new social label. If anyone likes this book I call them &#34;shades of grey-ers&#34; with all that implies and drop them a notch. I actually profile people based on their approval of this awful book. When I first started reading this I thought it must have been written by a low esteem, houseboun,d 40 year old virgin with 100 cats and a wardrobe consisting entirely of spandex pants and sweat shirts. Towards the end I just had to stop reading it. I mean who really cared what happened to these awful characters!? For me the only &#34;happy&#34; ending would be in a fiery crash that wiped them all out at once.
147676459X|5.0|This book is amazing. It has some of my favorite stories from her blog, plus new ones. I couldn't stop laughing while reading many of them, and I'll have to make all my friends read it too. Excellent book!!  :)
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I read this after seeing the movie with my daughter. The movie captured my interest because I found the take on lore interesting. I figured the book would be even better than the movie. Unfortunately I didn't find the book as interesting. I am a mature woman who can enjoy a good YA book but this one just felt to young for me. Very teen oriented. Good writing though, interesting take on the lore and good characters.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Had problems.  Bought the continued saga but lost the confirming email, and it won't let me purchase it again.  Sad that it takes real money to do a lot with this game.  Fun game though.
B00F57VFXO|3.0|My husband and I are reading this book together on my Kindle.  Obviously this is fiction.  We are a little over half through with it.<br /><br />My question about this novel is it is suppose to take place in January 1945?  He talks about Rommel as taking over for Hitler.  Rommel was murdered in 1944, after the attempt to kill Hitler.  He was forced to commit suicide.  It is hard to believe that with this much detail on the uniforms, and other things, a blantant error in history just stands out to me.  No mention of the Allies in France or the Russians heading to Poland.  By 1945 the war was coming to a close.  Is this an error in proof reading and it should be January 1944?
B0054XOMX4|5.0|I purchased this for my ten year old son. He has a bag full of Beyblades, but has enjoyed this on.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|My husband is an Ian Fleming fan.  He has read all his James Bond novels.  So when I saw this on Amazon, I thought it might be interesting.  I am always looking for new books to read to my husband as we are traveling or just spending a quiet night at home.  We especially like the spy, covert suspense novels like Vince Flynn's or Brad Thor's.  This one also hit the mark.  The book is intriguing and keeps you reading to find out how Ian gets out of this!  We thoroughly enjoyed Operation Armada!  And a side note.My husband has his CHL and carries a Walther PPK - not because it was Bond's.  He carries it because of the reason Q made Bond carry it.  It is a superior weapon!
B008JFUR10|5.0|Wow! i watch the movie on Thursday and then again on Saturday with my kids. a few bad words but a family event.
0345803507|5.0|Love this book!  Great easy reading!  Made it more interesting at home in the bedroom for sure!  buy all 3
0744014956|4.0|Very nicely put together hard cover, but in the end I found the hard cover a bigger pain to use the book. Would have preferred the normal softcover edition.
B00ENBS4GO|5.0|Was an awesome way to end Spartacus! The entire series was bad ass but this season by far has the best opposing force and leaders
0812550706|5.0|I love this book and so does everyone I know. I bought 35 to use in my classroom and we read it together as a class. After each chapter, the students answer questions in their reading journal. We are on chapter 7 and all my students are really enjoying the story. Many of them have even said that they never before would have considered science fiction. I teach high school MCJROTC and the lessons tie in with leadership and character development nicely.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It was good but hard some time I was very happy with this game it was worth the money I speet
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|As a middle-aged woman I get to take my granddaughter to movies, some of which I'm bored to tears with!  Not this movie!  The Minions alone make the movie worth every penny,but there's a lot more to the movie than them.  I had to have my own copy to watch now and then.
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|It's okay. Need for speed is much better. Not sure if it is my phone or the game but the play is slow and the controls are just so so. The graphics are pretty.
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|A Classic!  This movie is so good.  I highly recommend it for everybody's classic collection.  It is a great story and the acting is top notch.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|It is a bit complicated at first but hey it IS rocket science. Great fun and addicting. Basically you build rockets to complete missions. Along the way you have to learn about orbiting, power to weight ratios, and physics.<br />Worth the money.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|A classic!!  This is such a great movie.  A true mobster genre fan has to have this in their collection.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|Game play is great but what makes this game addictive is the trading done after each race. Nothing motivates you to suck up those bags of money more than the promise of hitting a batch of moonshine after the race.
B00006RJ7Y|5.0|This is a great story with a good moral to it. I think it's a movie most people should watch at least once. It's one of thoughs storys that moves you.
0547884591|5.0|Excellent book. So much more than food alone. Interesting and inspiring. A recipe for life and personal success, regardless of how you define it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son loves minions and even though he's two it keeps him happy during Dr visits even if he doesn't understand the game.
0385743564|5.0|I have enjoyed Brandon Sanderson's books since my daughter introduced them to me.  This is one of his best.  The concept of defeating the unbeatable was very appealing.  I also enjoyed the whole environment.  A great read, well worth your time. I look forward to the next chapter in the series.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|The overall rating is good.  The only issue I have with the game is not receiving rewards for finished tasks.  Growing ANY rare plants should allow you to receive your goals as promised.  Thank you
1401324649|5.0|It was a very funny, easy read.  It was recommended to me by a Dutch woman.  I would recommend it to you as well!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am a total candy crush addict. It's a great game. All my family and co-workers play it too. I'm amazed we get any work done.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|The chasing dragged on there for a while, but I'm glad I stuck it out.  I might consider reading more of the series at some point.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very informative. A must have in Florida. Plus I can easily see the weather in other cities. It's a very good app.
B00FX8EY60|3.0|Not as good as her older stuff, but still good. Slowly adjusting to the new songs. I'll give it a couple more plays.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Fun game not hard at all and for free what can you ask for<br /><br />Not t o men tion great for kids around Halloween
B008M9PHWM|5.0|Bob Dylan on vinyl + bonus Cd of the album. Great bonus. Great album. Vinyl makes you sit and listen.<br />Just wish there was more information on the cover and sleeves to enjoy while listening.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I loved this book! I think it really gives you a new perspective on animals and loyalty. Although it is not a book for small children, as there is quite a bit of savegery both on the parts of humans and dogs, it is a book that shows you how much the wild can change a personality.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Did not care for this style of writing , but understanding the area where it was staged. Would not recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game have it on every devise I own. Hate that I have to pay for somethings but other than that I can not stop playing.

B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I like the game although there are a lot of interruptions in between hunts a lot of popups to deal with but it is ok
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Always different. Really like the daily games. I like the challenge of trying for 2 + stars.  I Don,t get bored with them.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Kids loved it. All night long the kids roared and acted like monsters. If you like the first movie you will love this one.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I really enjoyed Wonder. It was out of my normal reading genre, but I found the book very engaging for adults and middle grade readers alike. The themes in the book - kindness, determination, curiosity, bravery, self-doubt, friendship, family, trust - are quite valuable, especially for kids going through the difficult transition in middle school, and R.J. Palacio weaves such big-picture ideas effortlessly into the story. I imagine kids who read this will look at the way they've been treated by their peers and how they've treated kids who are a little bit different and feel encouraged to examine their own actions.<br /><br />I gave this book four stars because while I appreciated the way Palacio changed characters throughout the book, giving the reader a peek into how the rest of the world views August and the way he is treated, I felt that his voice was still the strongest. I would have liked to see a little more attention paid to making every single voice participating in narration distinctive and recognizable, even without reading the character's name before their chapter(s).<br /><br />Otherwise, a wonderful read, and highly recommended!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Pretty much what you would expect.  Interesting and different physics.  Not insanely difficult to upgrade.  Ads need to load otherwise the game crashes on Kindle so you need wifi.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|This is the first modern buddy movie and it remains the best, even though it has inspired dozens of imitators in many other genres. Paul Newman, in the first of his three pairings with director George Roy Hill, plays Butch, head of the Hole in the Wall gang of robbers and rustlers in the late 19th century. Robert Redford is the Kid, who has been carrying the name for quite a while and is beginning to ripen as a gunfighter. Their characters were real, but the story is pretext for William Goldman's hip, Oscar-winning script that plays almost - but not - everything for deadpan laughs. This perennial audience-pleaser features Conrad Hall's gorgeous, golden-hued photography of Utah and Colorado locales, and Burt Bacharach's contemporary, sometimes completely anachronistic music. The song, \\"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head,\\" sung by B.J. Thomas, won the Oscar, even though it had nothing to do with the story. It's just that audiences loved the scene with Newman and Katherine Ross looking good riding a bicycle together. The centerpiece sequence is a 30-minute chase across spectacular landscapes, as Butch and Sundance attempt to elude a relentless band of hired lawmen, with one or the other of the two frequently asking, \\"Who are those guys?\\" and the chase ending with ... well, see the movie. You're likely to love it. [[ASIN:B00HU8VK4K Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)]]

B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I was disappointed in the outcome.  I guessed the &#34;big secret&#34;  before it was revealed.  It was not as &#34;shocking&#34; as I was led to believe by someone who had already read the book.  I guess I was just expecting more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Totally addicting and fun game Enjoy playing this game every time I think I cannot possibly pass a level suddenly I do ...
B00005AR3G|5.0|Wow--this Disney movie was so thoroughly entertaining and laugh-out-loud funny I can't believe i haven't seen it until now.  The characters are so well developed and lovable-- David Spade and John Goodman are perfect and Kronk is one of the funniest Disney characters ever!  The lines are witty and snappy--such a contrast with the usual boring and flat Dreamworks...and now Disneyfare.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I really love the fact that you don't need to physically connect a cord from your laptop to your television. This device makes it so easy for you to stream your favorite videos, shows, movies on a bigger screen. It also connects pretty fast and the HD quality is amazing. The only thing I wish it allowed me to do is to be able to display my computer screen so I can do other things like display powerpoint presentations.

B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|Bridget Jones is one of my favorite people (not a book character). This book was very different from previous books, and sagged a little in the middle (but Bridget is 51 so this makes sense). Nevertheless, I am glad I read it and hope it becomes a movie.

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|amazing game.very good designs with many maps and vehicles.l recommend this game to anyone. also unlock everything can u guys put a new update tor new characters please getting tired of the old one
B008RA3X5E|2.0|Don't get me wrong the app works fine.  However, if you consider downloading the free version of this I highly recommend that you just buy it.  If you don't buy it the app will CONSTANTLY bug you to buy it.  It nags and nags (it takes over your screen until you answer if you want to buy or not).  It really is just annoying to open the app at all.  Beware though by purchasing this app you are really just inviting it to bug you  to buy OTHER apps (wow! a premium calculator. now I can figure out a tip - premium style).  An insecure and needy app. I'd move on if I were you.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Love the case, I am very happy about this purchase, My phone came with a case, but it broke right away.  I just wish I had known that it was plastic, I was hoping for a neoprene, rubber one.
B0063M22QO|5.0|FUN TO PLAY, keeps you interested.  Well worth the .99 cents.<br /><br />You will not get bored with it as fast as some other games.

B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Campy but probably not campy enough.Still, a bad guy named Hannibal and mech warriors named after a cheap liquor? Pays homage to Godzilla flicks and has it's moments. Kind of a mash up of Godzilla vs the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.<br /><br />Favorites: the two nerdy boffins are well played, but the best single scene in the flick was the confrontation between the Hannibal and the embryonic creature and Hannibal.<br /><br />All through the flick I kept hearing faintly in the background &#34;History shows again and again how nature points up the folly of man.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is more fun on the Kindle and seems to be more challenging. It keeps you coming back for more.
B001MM28JG|5.0|I love Star Trek and Sci fi movies and this is the funniest spoof of the space movie genre. Great cast and truly laugh out loud moments that make you recall all the silliness of the Enterprise. I have watched it many times and decided to buy the download for my kindle so that I can watch it again and again.

B00FG1Q5J8|4.0|This is one of those games that remind me of the older days when all the games were playable and enjoyable. The pixel graphics are interesting and colorful. Gameplay is excellent with surprises on the way while exploring the vastness of space. One thing that I did not like was the touch interface. Sometimes it is not that easy to select a small crew member especially when you need to have a little bit of quick reaction to some space zombie situation. But that was maybe an issue on my smaller mobile screen and my not so small fingers. I think it would be perfect for tablets. Overall it is a great game and I would recommend it.

B00003CXBK|2.0|Apparently, the Japanese think this is awesome, but I am not Japanese. I thought it was long and boring. There is absolutely no comic relief. On the plus side, the animation is very well done, there are some beautiful scenes. Yes it was imaginative, but I much prefer Spirited Away or Howl's Moving Castle.

1492740381|4.0|“Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man’s face. It cannot be concealed.”<br /><br />All creatures enjoy beauty and pleasure. Is, however, there a danger in enjoying it too much? In his 1890 novel, Oscar Wilde tells the story of a young man, Dorian Gray, who has been blessed with vital youth and beauty, so much that he has become the muse of a painter named Basil Hallward. After creating a masterpiece portrait of Gray, Hallward gives the painting to his muse. In a fit of jealousy over the fact that the painting will remain forever young and beautiful, Dorian wishes that he could trade places with it - that the painting would age while he would stay innocent.<br /><br />After befriending Lord Harry Wotton, Dorian Gray begins to be influenced by the cynical man. Wotton believes that pleasure and beauty is at the zenith of human experience, and it is the experience of these things that is more important than anything else. After breaking the heart of a young actress, Dorian goes home to discover that, while he himself remains pure on the outside, the painting Hallward made has begun to change. The image in the portrait now bears the mark of evil, while Gray himself stays in an eternal state of youth, innocence, and beauty.<br /><br />Over time, thanks to the influence of Lord Henry and the lack of learning from his mistakes, Dorian goes further and further into a life of debauchery. And, while he stays perpetually at the age of twenty, the portrait hidden in his attic bears the marks of his life of vice, becoming a cruel image of a man who has done no good in the world. But our actions and choices do eventually catch up with us, and, try as he might, Dorian cannot escape his past.<br /><br />The genius of Oscar Wilde is in his ability to say exactly what one is thinking, whether it be couth or not. In &#34;The Picture of Dorian Gray&#34;, he paints a beautiful example of the desires of many at the end of the nineteenth century, from the bored aristocrat to those who are motivated by the superficial. And while Wilde is undoubtedly at his best in either play or short-story form, this is one novel that is extraordinary in the fact that, over a century later, it remains relevant to society.those who are motivated by the superficial.

B00004RFCM|3.0|Oh the huge hair. Oh the pink tutu. Oh Carrie!<br /><br />Despite hearing much about the show, I had never seen an entire episode of Sex and the City. My purchase of season 1 made for a great time. Unmistakably raunchy, and at times sweet, it is an addicting ride through New York. It revolves around the 30 year old Carrie and her group of friends with their relationship and sex issues. Seeing these women have real life problems we have all been through before is rather comforting. Not to mention, the dialogue is snappy and laugh bursting. Only thing dragging the show down is Carrie's awkward camera talking, random interviews with city people, and a few forgettable episodes.<br /><br />But as for the packaging of Sex and the City (DVD)? It is absolutely terrible! The boxes break easily and do not close carefully. It was also disappointing how the menu screen was so simple, there is no way to skip to a specific scene! How inconvenient.<br /><br />Great show, poor presentation. Hope I can buy future seasons in their new updated boxes.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|This movie is a great look into life with Huntington's Disease. I think Hathaway's performance in this is amazing! Huntington's is a terrifying disease. As well it does give a good look into the struggle of those with progressively degenerative diseases. There is a lot of nudity in this movie. I mean, I don't really care one way or the other about nudity, but there is more than I feel the film needed. It is also mainly just female nudity, I think we saw Gyllenhaal's booty at least one time though! But hey that mean's there's nudity for everyone!<br />Just make sure the kiddos are asleep if you don't want them to see the human anatomy in it's natural state.

Despite not enjoying much of his new work, not caring for his lack of characterization nowadays, I enjoy Tim Burton's older films. The Nightmare Before Christmas is another class and essential for the Halloween season. Animation was beautifully disturbing, songs were a blast, and it ran at perfect timing.<br /><br />My only complaint was how the DVD playing. No menu screen that allows you to navigate to the movie or special features? Really? I thought the VHS tape era was over. So... not sure if the DVD was being nostalgic on purpose or just being cheap.<br /><br />Probably cheap!<br /><br />5 star movie but 1 star for the way this DVD plays. For such a loved movie, this is just a bit ridiculous.

B0051E9INK|2.0|I was looking forward to this movie.  I watched some of the series years ago and thought this would be a great flick, especially with the incomparable Connery.  Who cannot help but fantasize about the gift of immortality and the inevitable knowledge it brings?  However, I was certainly disappointed with this this film.<br /><br />It's so 80's and cliché.  The only thing it's missing is breakdancing by 400 year old immortals.  The production quality is poor, but I suppose it's well before the age of big budget films.  I just feel there is far more that could have been done with character development or historical value.  Even the combat scenes are a joke!  There are fireworks ever time one of their swords touched metal.  Maybe we were all coked up idiots in the 80s and thought this kind of nonsense was cool.  It doesn't seem that way to me now.<br /><br />It's a cool idea for a story, but it's dated and executed poorly by 2013 standards.  I suppose that it's destined to be resurrected with modern cinematography.  Please, please, just don't have Michael Bay involved and overdo the CGI.  The hook is the character and his evolution within and with mankind through the ages.  There can be only one, but this one is not it.  2 1/2 stars.

Importantly, Johnson crafts a story that reveals the lives of people across the spectrum of the populace and documents the terrors they live with, all sourced from interviews of the lucky few who have escaped. His character descriptions are notably exceptional and readily put the reader in their lives, as difficult as that may be. Unquestionably one of the best books of the year.

1416550550|5.0|A great read, a great story...actually, a story within a story within in a story.  At first you may overlook that there is a date written before the start of each chapter.  You must make a mental note of that before reading to make it clear as to where the characters are and in what era/age/etc...once you do that, you're golden.<br /><br />There are tons of reviews on this and all I can say is I loved this book. It held my interest right out of the gate. It kept getting better and better.  It was suspenseful and you cared about the characters, the good ones that is.  I made the mistake of reading this before THE HOUSE AT RIVERTON.  It was hard for that book to measure up to this one, altho' that one improved with each successive chapter, just a bit slower at first. This one, a page turner.
B0042816YK|2.0|I borrowed this movie from a local library after hearing so many good comments about it. Perhaps we watched different movies, because I was was rather disappointed.<br /><br />The story revolves around Liz, a woman who visits a medicine man that reads her palm and tells her about the future. She decides to take his information to heart and begins making major changes in her life based on this knowledge. She begins by divorcing her husband, a man with lots of ambition but lacks focus. She finds comfort in the arms of a younger stage actor but shortly after realizes it was more of a rebound relationship than anything.<br /><br />In an attempt to figure out her priorities, she decides to take a year long trip through various locations hoping to find whatever it is she is missing. Her travels begin in Italy where she happens upon an English speaking Swedish woman at a local coffee shop. The two of them become friends and her social network in Italy begins expanding. Here she learns that sometimes doing nothing is alright, which is probably the best advice in the whole movie.<br /><br />Next she moves on to India to visit a spirtual leader she became interested in while dating the actor/yoga instructor. This seemed rather odd because it seemed like she wasn't all that interested in the leader while dating her boyfriend, so why would she travel around the world to attend her retreat in a different country? Here she is able to forgive herself for the divorce and any other wrongdoings in her life.<br /><br />The final locale is Bali where she reunites with the medicine man from the beginning and becomes his temporary assistant. He teaches her to find her balance in life, but ultimately tells her to forget the balance if she can find a love strong enough.<br /><br />Maybe the book is better because it can dwell more on tiny details and personal reflections. The movie, however, came across as a woman who had a pretty good life (successful author, large circle of friends, anda caring husband) who decides she wants more/something different. It seemed very much like a man's mid-life crisis taken to the extreme. At least with a mid-life crisis you might buy an expensive car or &#34;toy&#34;, but Liz decides to leave everyone she loves behind in order to go on a self imposed mission to discover herself mentally and spiritually. For the average person this type of &#34;retreat&#34; would not be monetarily obtainable, but due to her success she is able to shirk all obligations for an entire year.

Fortunately help is at hand in this definitive work of reference from Jordans.<br /><br />Now in a new third edition containing much new material, `Education and the Courts' has established itself as an authoritative and valuable work of reference, focusing as it does on the approach taken by the courts to education litigation in England and Wales. Written by an acknowledged expert in this area, the volume will certainly lend the practitioner, experienced or inexperienced, even further authority in court.<br /><br />In view of a number of significant new developments in education that have emerged since the former second edition of this work in 2003, the publication of this new edition is  certainly timely.  As author Richard McManus reminds us, the Law of School Transport has a new statutory framework, including the right to litigate pure transport issues in the First-tier Tribunal on behalf of those with statements of special educational needs.  Noteworthy here is that the role of the courts has been much reduced following the introduction of the right of appeal to the Upper Tribunal.<br /><br />There have been other developments carefully examined in this book.  For example, Chapter 3 on `Discrimination' deals, among a host of other matters, with disputes about school uniforms and dress codes, particularly religious dress, as in the case of (Begum) v Denbigh High School in the House of Lords in which it was held that the school's uniform policy was justified.<br /><br />Pertinent to this and other matters throughout, is the detailed examination of the impact of the Human Rights Act 1998.  Also in the field of school organisation, the last decade has seen the proliferation of Academies, although as the author points out the problems created by single sex schools and equality still have not been resolved.<br /><br />These issues, together with the full range of education related disputes are covered succinctly, yet in detail, including for example, school admissions... school discipline and exclusions... and private law actions in damages -- as well as university students and independent schools.<br /><br />Whether you regularly practice in this field, or much of it is new to you, this book will certainly appeal.  Note that there are ample resources for further research, with extensive footnoting and all the relevant tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments, EU Materials and Codes of Practice, plus as the useful index at the back.

Indeed, as the publishers Edward Elgar have explained, `Modern Piracy' is the first book to survey the law of maritime piracy, both from the perspectives of public and commercial law.<br /><br />In one compact volume, it presents a wide cross section of expertise on this fraught and increasingly worrisome subject from at least a dozen learned contributors -- academics and practicing lawyers -- of which the editor is one.  Hailing from a variety of backgrounds, they collectively offer the reader the benefit of a dazzling array of academic qualifications and practical, top-level experience.<br /><br />As mentioned in the preface, the book reflects the work of the Modern Laws of High Seas Piracy Project, the members of which have come from academia, government and private practice, primarily in Europe, North America and South East Asia.  Who better then, to offer the reader an extremely useful range of opinion and insight into the problem of piracy!<br /><br />One of the aims of the book, as the editor explains, is to consider piracy `in the round'.  Piracy in context is dealt with in Part I.  Part II examines the law from a state and government perspective and in Part III the law is examined as it relates to the concerns of private business, including the legal framework and the general law of marine insurance in relation to piracy, including a range of matters pertaining to risk.<br /><br />Piracy of course encompasses a wide spectrum of crimes, from violence and detention on the high seas to criminal acts within territorial or internal waters, including `armed robbery against ships' and more besides.<br /><br />In Part IV therefore, a number of conclusions are reached - at least tentatively - surrounding the various themes that are common to the fight against piracy, including concepts of efficiency, justice and law enforcement, centring on state intervention -- including the military -- as opposed to private initiatives.<br /><br />The work is extensively and meticulously footnoted, with a detailed index at the back, the book functions as an excellent research tool as well as rather a riveting read for everyone from international lawyers and academics across a range of disciplines, to those specializing in maritime commercial law.  Practitioners in this specialist area will certainly appreciate this current, contemporary and practical examination of it.

Note, however that emphasis is placed on the private limited company as, according to the authors, `the vast majority of companies currently registered in the United Kingdom are private companies'.<br /><br />Definitely a boon to administrators under pressure is the way in which the book is logical organised. The authors are keen to have you note that each section, or sub-section cross refers to the appropriate precedents and that individual precedents are annotated to indicate the important and relevant issues: and they are right!<br /><br />The authors point out in the introduction that this large format, hardback volume of some nine-hundred pages has been updated to reflect the practical and legal changes in company administration since the publication of the previous edition.<br /><br />In so doing, this guide provides practical help and up to date information and insights into the challenges faced by company secretaries and the specialized knowledge they require.<br /><br />The book contains much new material.  For example, there is a new chapter on the procedures for correcting incorrect data recorded at Companies House -- and there is another new section on the re-designation of share classes, i.e. where a particular share class is re-designated into a different class.<br /><br />What is especially useful in the conduct of everyday secretarial tasks is - of course -- the wealth of precedents - hundreds of them  -- plus numerous forms -- all included on the accompanying CD ROM, as well as the printed text, so they can be adapted to individual  requirements.

B0060D3BWK|5.0|This movie was my childhood. Watching it again, it's amazing to see the great performances by all the actresses and actors. You never notice such things when you're a child, but with more perspective as an adult, you can imagine how much fun everyone must have had. A classic movie.
0857931040|5.0|DO RUN ALONG AND BUY THIS BOOK<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />UK membership of the European Union has come under fire of late and it seems the resulting do-we-stay or do-we-go controversy is likely to bubble under for some time.  In the meantime though, practitioners tackling any aspect of European Law will welcome the arrival of this comprehensive handbook on this vast and complex subject.<br /><br />Recently published by Edward Elgar Publishing, this is a completely updated and augmented new edition of a classic text and as such, is certainly a must-have handbook for all practitioners involved in any way in European Union law.<br /><br />Co-author David Edward is Professor Emeritus in the School of Law at the University of Edinburgh and has served as a judge of the European Court of Justice.  He and his colleague Robert Lane, also at the School of Law, Edinburgh, have created an authoritative text of almost 1,000 pages, they also point out that the book is a brand new statement of EU Law written now by Lane.<br /><br />Written with the aim of stating the law as simply as possible and providing quick access to the primary materials, the work has grown from its original hundred pages to its present length, an indicator if there ever was one, of the increasing scope and depth of EU law.<br /><br />The book begins with a thoughtful and incisive historical overview, referred to in the Foreword by Eleanor Sharpston.  As Advocate General, Court of Justice of the European Union, Luxembourg, she declares that this piece of writing  “should be compulsory reading for anyone wanting to sound off publicly about ‘Europe’,” adding that “the reader is given a real understanding of the contradictions that make up the EU: idealism and pragmatism, federal vision and the ferocious defence of national interests”.<br /><br />Further chapters provide expert cover and analysis of the key issues pertaining to European Union law, including for example, the constitutional structure of the European Union, the Treaties, the institutional framework, the key case law of the Court of Justice and of course, much more.<br /><br />Copiously footnoted, the book reflects the developments that have taken place since the Treaty of Lisbon and there is extensive reference to primary sources, particularly in the book’s five appendices.<br /><br />Those doing further research will also appreciate the almost 200 pages containing the tables of cases, treaties and legislation, plus the detailed table of contents and extensive index.  The law is stated as at 1 September 2012.ining to European Union law, including for example, the constitutional structure of the European Union, the Treaties, the institutional framework, the key case law of the Court of Justice and of course, much more.<br /><br />Copiously footnoted, the book reflects the developments that have taken place since the Treaty of Lisbon and there is extensive reference to primary sources, particularly in the book’s five appendices.<br /><br />Those doing further research will also appreciate the almost 200 pages containing the tables of cases, treaties and legislation, plus the detailed table of contents and extensive index.

Certainly the book covers a broad range of countries and regions, from the major European jurisdictions to those in Asia which are now driving forward the world economy, including China, India and Japan.<br /><br />As mentioned in the preface, this Handbook aims at putting forward a scientific contribution to the identification of what could constitute the global features of intellectual property licensing agreements.  It touches on the issues involved in the eventual adoption of a global regulatory framework of intellectual property contract law.  Maybe, just maybe, suggests the book, it may be possible to evolve just such a harmonized legal framework worldwide, of intellectual property licensing policies!<br /><br />And now back to Sir Robin's comments on this handbook, that we really couldn't possibly express any better than we can.<br /><br />`This book,' he declares, `is readable - and anyone concerned with intellectual property licensing should read it and will find it a pleasure to do so. They will also learn a lot about some of the pitfalls and bear-traps to be found around the world....The book will be on our students' reading list.'<br /><br />For those involved in any way in IP, IP licensing and/or contract law, this book contains any number of illuminating and ultimately profitable insights into this vitally important subject and should really be in the professional library of every IP practitioner.

1846612985|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moAJU54A47J9B5]]<br /><br />ALSO AVAILABLE AS AN eBOOK<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Always a complex, contentious and emotionally charged area of law -- and not for the faint hearted -- family law has actually become more complicated in the wake of a tsunami of social change, including a number of variants in the basic nuclear family structure that have emerged in recent years.<br /><br />Especially when under pressure, family lawyers need the reassurance of knowledgeable and authoritative guidance from time to time and here it is:  the new second edition of `Advocacy in Family Proceedings' recently published by Jordans as part of their distinguished Family Law series.<br /><br />The new edition is especially timely in that the Coalition government will shortly enact the Crime and Courts Act 2012 which will establish a single family court for England and Wales.  Although this development will bring about a number of changes within a continually evolving landscape, the fundamental necessity of good advocacy remains.<br /><br />Author David Bedingfield is careful to point out that while family law advocates are responsible for certain duties that differ slightly from those of other advocates, certain basic rules of advocacy remain:  know your audience... know the theory of the case... know that courtesy never lost a case... and so forth.<br /><br />Constructing a convincing `theory of the case' in the skeleton argument is particularly important.  It should `do no less than settle the dispute,' says the author. Fundamentally it should explain why the court should decide that `your client is right and the other side is wrong'. So simple you might say, yet in the realities of family law, so complex.<br /><br />If you are involved professionally in family law issues, from adoption, ancillary relief and same sex families to child abduction, domestic violence, applications under the Children Act 1989 and appeals, this useful reference work offers practical guidance in helping you enhance your competence as well as your confidence under fire. And unlike many other legal texts, this book, with its practical, commonsense approach is as accessible to the novice and student advocate as it is to the experienced practitioner.<br /><br />This is an erudite, yet readable volume in which  research resources abound.  Note the extensive tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and practice directions, as well as the handy table of abbreviations and the wealth of footnotes throughout.  The detailed table of contents and index at the back aid navigation, especially when time is short.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't have enough time or space to say how much I love this book! I was very skeptical at first because this was my first book with this author. However, when I started reading it, I had a hard time putting it down, at the same time hoping it would never end. I'm pretty good at figuring out events in books before they happen in them an this one was no exception but I liked it, regardless, it still kept me on my toes per say. I will and have recommended this book to anyone and everyone I can. Great great read . Very good job !
006202406X|1.0|Terrible - ruined the series.  Wish I had never read.  Worst ending ever and wondering how any editor thought people would like this.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Swiftkey is easy to use, customizable and allows any user to &quot;swipe&quot; and is very user friendly. Smooth usage and beautiful looks!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love love it amazing can't wait to read the rest and see the movies beat book I've read in a while
B006LSZECO|3.0|Disturbing characters and plot twists that made you shake your head and kept you guessing throughout the book. Good read although it would not be one I would be interested in reading again and again.
B00AAZSH0U|5.0|I remember laughing out loud *11 years ago in the bookstore about how hilarious these books are. This was the one that made us giggle the most! Enjoy! We still share them with new little ones!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Jacob is a character you really hope will come out unscathed, but the family is the true victim of the plot. Interesting ending that seems fitting.
B004JMY312|5.0|Always a great family Halloween movie! We watch it every year. I was glad to find I could rent it through Amazon streaming.
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|While this album isn't as sweepingly majestic as their first, they did a superb job with the songs on it.  They are amazing singers as a duo and just as amazing as soloists.  They are my favorite artists and I will be looking forward to their next album.  They are truly wonderful.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|As an adult, when I read a YA series I (a) don't expect that much and (b) don't pay much attention to reviews. I remember what it was like to be a teen, albeit before the internet, and yeah, things are much worse when you're that age. For what it's worth, and without revealing any spoilers, I think that the author took a bold approach in this section of the series. It was an enjoyable read -- not a masterpiece by any stretch -- and it made me want to re-read the previous two books. So, if you're a teen, you'll probably hate this book; if you read it with the maturity of an adult, you'll appreciate it for what it is -- an easy read.
B00F2HW220|5.0|The tracks flow seamlessly, another epic release with an expectedly superb group of artists - whether a first-time audition of AAL, or long time fan, totally agreed with those previously stating one can listen repeatedly with unending enjoyment.  Bravissimo!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun if we did not have this game I don't think kindled would not be as fun I just AM absent with this game I mean I looooooooooooove this game
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|this game is a good game for anyone that likes hunting games. had some trouble downloading for kindle but other than that a pretty good game.
B009LDCXNY|4.0|I love this show, so of course I am satisfied.  I don't know if it is just my DVD player or the DVD itself, but I am not able to pause the DVD.  It's not a big deal, because I can stop the DVD on my DVD player and hit play to start right where I left off.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Thank you Amazon for adding Candy Crusn Saga to our apps. Love this game and am so excited to finally play it on my Kindle.<br />I was disappointed when after purchasing my Kindle, I wasn't able to play Candy Crush on it.!! This game is very addicting!!!<br /> Only downside is having to pay each time I reach a certain level.<br />Thanks again.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|For some reason I hadn't read the reviews on this movie \\"World War Z.\\"  I am tired of Zombie movies and this was another one with the un-dead or whatever.  Had I thought about it I wouldn't have ordered it, although the rental was only 99 cents! So I won't give it much of a review as Zombies do not turn me on, even on Halloween.  Sorry.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This game is so awesome I can't believe you can get these guns it's so amazing get It you won't regret it
B00BWDSO5C|5.0|Totally enjoyed it. Love all the bonus material as well. Certain to become one of my favorite movies to watch yearly if not more.
B00E6890VC|5.0|I love CHVRCHES, and had never really considered buying a CD or vinyl since I get most of my musical digitally now. Boy, am I glad I got this on vinyl. I can just sit and listen to this for a while, and it never gets old. Every song on this album is a hit, in my opinion.
B005XN31LY|4.0|If you are even at the point of reading the reviews for this show then it is for you. The plotline and ideas of the story are great, but sometimes the acting is a bit over-dramatic. The first season is the best. I recommend it 100% be cause it is really fun to watch and see how the writers incorporated all of the different fairytales and stories. I only give it four stars because of the acting, but that really isn't a big problem. If I could, I would give the first season 4.5 stars. If you don't have Netflix, then Amazon is definitely the best place to buy this season.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Command and Control is packed with new information about the technical, personal, and political challenges that characterized the development and deployment of nuclear weapons. Author Eric Schlosser masterfully interwove broad issues with a specific Titan II accident near Damascus, Arkansas. His coverage of Los Alamos events was not simply a retelling of the familiar story, but full of new insights, just as was his recounting of the slippery history of just who was in control of America's nuclear arsenal, particularly who decided how to balance reliability versus safety of the awesome devices. The struggle between civilian leaders and the Strategic Air Command is particularly illuminating. Readers should not skip Schlosser's detailed endnotes; I found them almost as informative as the text.
B0050PYNP8|4.0|Paul is great I recommend it to any Sci fi person that also has a sense if hummor. Don't miss Paul you can watch over and over.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game but very addicting! Unfortunately I spent most of my time waiting for more lives from friends! Oh well! Guess I'll wait!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Easy & fun. Can't put it down. Down side, not enough directions, had to figure out how to play on my own. Terminology didn't make it easy at all.  Example:  &#34; Bring down ingredients &#34;  I didn't have a clue what ingredients were until I talked to a friend. Fun to play when you Fourier out.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|I think its ok becouse I cont find enemy ga.es I like so Hayes _,it is ok for me and my family so ya I.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Didn't know what all the fuss was about until it came on Kindle. Awesome game!!!!<br /><br />Wish you had limited tries though.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The best yet; sad to see one of the main characters killed in a car accident any chance he will come out of this alive remains to be seen
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Doesn't have the same capabilities as a smart tv and needs to support more apps. I didn't do more research when I bought because I was under the impression that it would stream from the chrome web browser but it doesn't . So basically it's a YouTube streamer. For the price it's ok for now.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Need to have more options to get peanuts when playing kung future.  I never get more than 25 to 50.  Most of the time I only get 1.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a great game. I like everything about it . I only play when I really have nothing to do .
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|One of my favorites movies from Tom Hanks, if not his best.  Even though the movie is long it keeps you entertained.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|If 4.5 stars was an option, i think I would have chosen that. I enjoyed the third book in the series a lot.  The third book expands a lot on the mythology of the world and you get to learn the history of the Inquisitors and Obligators, which were mostly missing from the second book.  If you enjoyed the other books in the series, you will enjoy this one as well.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|This book was great expanding on the characters from the first made this a much more in depth read as you were with the people you read about in the first. which i would also heartily say READ IT!<br />A much more full bodied experience this time around as you knew the characters and only needed a little refresher on who they were. I myself have recently written a book involving some Indian lore, but nothing as inclusive as this. I have always loved this spiritual side especially when used in one of my favorite genres fantasy. Which along with some romance this book mixes well.<br />Seriously recommend this book for anyone remotely interested in these three areas, fantasy, spirituality and romance though i'm sure people who appreciate good writing will also love this book just a work of genius also.
B000UZQI0Q|3.0|After finishing the series, I would have to say that this one was the weakest of the three.  That isn't to say that it isn't a enjoyable read, it is just that it isn't on the same level as the first and third.  If you enjoyed the first book, I would recommend continuing on through the entire series.  The best part of the second book is the evolution that you get to see in Elend.
0545615402|5.0|Loved the set. Felt like I was a Hogwart's student. I lovef the comments made by Ron and Harry in the books.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game, but would be better if it connected to fb easier. Other than that it is a fun game.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|My 11 yr old was totally engrossed in this as we read it together.  Such an inspiration. Anyone that has a love for learning will relate to the main character in the book.  Highly recommend it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THE GLITCHES, BUT I PLAY THIS GAME EVERYDAY GOING N COMING TO WORK
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Great book, it made me smile and laugh. I found it very entertaining and sweet. Perfect if you are looking for a light and funny read with a touch of romance.
B002NVTSGQ|4.0|The first few episodes started as laugh out loud funny. It tapered off a bit since then, but still funny.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|This movie was really cheap. The product came quickly and in excellent condition. However the movie itself is not that great. The kids like it so I guess that mean something but not a movie I have watched more than once
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun and anyone can play. It doesn't take long to understand how the game works. I highly recommend it.
0307891372|5.0|A must have if you have this game. Great guide for finding secrets and helping with quests. I have these books for my gta games and all the elder scrolls games. They are well worth the money.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|i read alot! and this story was very hard for me to get into! it does not keep up motivated in the story, the only reason i am trying to finish it, is because i paid for it!!!  sorry!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|The grafics are clear and move right along to the touch. I like the background music, it makes playing a relaxing experience .
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I really don't care what anyone has to say this to me  is the best comedy I have ever seen, simon peg is the bomb in this movie, he is too funny and the expressions he makes throughout the whole movie is too perfect
B007Z8ZKS2|4.0|Very enjoyable read. Well written. Easy to relate to the characters. A definite tear jerker! I Would recommend it without hesitation
B00004R9A4|5.0|I grew up watching this movie and it never gets old, I love this movie a lot it is so enjoyable
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|Best show I've watched all year. The first two episodes are pretty good, but they get increasingly better from there.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|at first I was really against the show cuz i'm tired of seeing zombies movies or anything zombies, but after I first saw the last 3 episodes of season 2 into season 3 I got hooked on right away and these actors are really amazing I prefer this over world war z, sorry brad pitt I prefer slow zombies over fast zombies
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Every bit as addictive as the de game. I think this game is awesome for kids because it makes them think and use your imagination.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|each and every actress have brought these characters to life soo much and you can relate to each sibling in some way
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|She is amazing and a wonderful role model for women old and young!  How fortunate we are to be able to hear her story first hand!
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game. The format is fun<br />and different. The graphics are nice. Lots of HO for<br />those that enjoy them. Plays well on my kindle fire.<br />The only drawback was the excessive time it took to<br />download.
B006PIXKVW|4.0|Almost as good as the original with Shirley Temple that I have watched 100X over the years. Very believable characters and a slightly different twist to the original. Definitely worth watching!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Nice, clean interface, efficient service; if you need to free space in your device, this will do the job perfectly.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|glad that this is finally available on kindle.  this game is addictive!  some levels can't. be won without buying tools.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|This was a nice upgrade from the single disk Little Mermaid DVD I bought that was initially released by Disney back in the day when the Divx thing fizzed and Disney had to adopt DVD as the standard.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of rebuying my existing Library unless it is something I truly enjoy.  I am pretty sure Disney has done re-releases of Little Mermaid as DVD special editions and such but I passed on those.  However when the Blu-ray release came with 3D and all the other hype, I did decide to rebuy.  I am not sold on the 3D but I figured I would buy the current best release.<br /><br />The big thing I like about rebuying some of the Disney Blu-ray releases is the &#34;remastering&#34; and &#34;upconverting&#34; they do for Blu-ray.  As much as the picture has been cleaned up for 1080p, I think the audio upconversion is the big win here.  If you have a decent home theater setup, the audio is noticeably fuller on a Blu-ray presentation than a DVD presentation.  Mostly, the richer audio experience as opposed to the video experience is what warrants the purchase.<br /><br />As far as extras, everything that appears to have been included in the DVD set is on this package.  Although, these original special features appear to have been lifted from the original DVD set with no special treatment for Blu-ray.  There is also some new features as well that were just for the Blu-ray.  Also some of the digital addons like a digital copy of the movie and some soundtrack music inclusions are nice touches.<br /><br />Whether you had this in your collection before or buying it for the first time, this was a nice addition/upgrade.<br /><br />I think Disney will be hard pressed to top this release when it is pulled out of the vault again next time.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Lorraine Warren is a fascinating woman portrayed in this film that I was most anxious to see. I was not disappointed as it provided non-stop excitement and terror.
B004ZISVWC|4.0|Thrilling sci-fi that kept me watching. For low-budget film the visual effects were pretty good. Blah blah blah blah blah blah
B00992CF6W|5.0|add more mobs. give the ability to use mods and make it to where u have to know the crafting recipies like on minecraft and there should be an easy way to change skins but otherwise a great game.
1616550414|5.0|Fantastic, informational, interesting! I am such a Zelda nerd and definitly love having this as a part of my collection!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Cute graphics. Intuitive game play. Plenty of levels. Challenging, but solvable puzzles. Fun for pre-k on up.  It was the free app of the day, but it is worth the two bucks.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|This is the most irritating game I think I have ever played I have been stuck on 20 forever it gives you the same Color ball over and over and it is never the Color you need. I like hard games but its no fun to play impossible games especially when they make you wait forever after only 5 lives.
B007SGM084|2.0|I prefer my bedroom play in my home and not my books.  To be honest I have not read the trilogy.  It does seem to be well written but stopped  me cold not too far in.  There are lots of books that are quite good without pages and pages of sex.  This old timer will stick to them.
B004UID2LC|4.0|it could be better but you have to take in the creator's opinion after all. its perfectly understandable how the creator feels
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great book and wonderful story.  Held my interest from the very start.  Can't wait to start next book by him!
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Maggie was the main character of the story and I was so taken with her personality and her perseverance in finding her sister`s killer, that I read the story as fast as I could.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun and very addicting wish there was more lives but all and all is a great game.
B00915G6MG|5.0|NCIS  always delivers.  It's the number one show on TV and you can see that the formula is still there.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|Earn to die is a really fun game. I wan't to go outside but this game is saying stay in here and play me.
B00F8MIIKO|5.0|I really liked the movie. It was funny and I liked how he kept believing he was a scary monster even though everyone told him he wasn't
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was amazing. Yes I was upset at the end. However that doesn't mean I declared the whole book a disaster. It was well written and very exciting. This book was an excellent conclusion to the series. Whoever says it is a horrible book don't listen. You need to go in with an open mind. Remember the author is only human. You can't expect everything of her. She did a really great job with this series.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Did not order this, I had already watch 10 or 11 episodes on an iPad and had to switch to computer at RV park Oct 22, as I was allowed only one device.  the computer is confusing, when I picked the episode 11, it ordered the whole season  for me and why would I buy it when I had it Free for almost the whole Season e 2.  Very confusing on the computer, easy on the Ipad.  I am a retired lady and do not like to spend money unnecessarily, bought Seasonn because I could get if free<br /><br />Suits is just a wonderful series, great stories, great characters and actors. Very interesting and nice to get away from Violent TV which seems to plague the series shows.
B00BHBBSZ2|2.0|I could not write in such a way that I could read my writing easily. The program demands that you write the whole word continuously and when you lift your finger the word is completed and shrunk to a regular reading size. However, that causes a lot of problems when you have to lift your hand to cross a t or dot an i. It all just looked messy.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|The series just concluded and I have listened to everyone talk about what a great show this is.  I decided to get the first season knowing only the basics of the plot.  I have been so pleasantly surprised.  It has exceeded all of the hype that I have heard.  Great writing, wonderful acting.
B00CELB94E|5.0|Coming into their Own! Better than their first album and an instant classic. A definite must buy for any Oasis or Liam fan
B001RTSPVY|5.0|So well written and superbly acted.  So engaging and at many times left me on the edge of my seat, literally.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a very compelling novel that was difficult to put down. The relationship between the two main characters evoked a spectrum of emotions. The author posed plausible explanations for the difficult decisions that were made.  There were  excellent arguments given  for both sides of the issues. Great read!
B00009NHC5|5.0|My daughter in a big fan of Audrey Hepburn and requested this as a Christmas gift to add to her collection.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|At first I thought this game was going to be for younger players, but some of the levels really make me think! Now I am addicted!!
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Now if you like Zombies Movies then watch this high action style movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Not your typical Night of the Living Dead, but can this really happen with all the unknown virus out there or could mutate?
B00ARF92HK|4.0|Felt like a 90's movie with modern effects, kind of like Pacific Rim. Overall, solid movie that is definitely action packed.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Really good movie and one that I recommend to watch on a Friday night with your spouse. Get it today on Amazon
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I have had this app for awhile and have been quite happy with it. The only complaint I have is the removal of the password features that provided an added security to documents stored on mobile devices. App developers - please restore this feature!
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|No five stars but will keep you in your seat. I enjoyed the movie but there was some hokie stuff that made unrealistic to me. What if there was a unknown force that lives underneath the sea an Alien force. Watch it.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Never ran out of power on my magic mouse and looks like an Apple original part.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|I am really surprise that this was a movie that I could not get out of my seat. Action pack as Will Smith son is on a mission to retrieve a detection device that will bring help. Yet there is a killer alien smelling fear from the young boy until he realizes that fear is just emotion. Good movie.
B009CFZVR6|5.0|Great movie. My pop, originally from Italy, loves the movie and has seen it 10 times at least.  The setting is totally accurate...the action and plot are really well thought out. The American hits all of your emotions and then goes deeper. Get it and I promise you will be pleased.
0062225790|3.0|I guess I was wanting more on the scientific career.  Some of the detailed accounts of poems and  rhymes of childhood were not what drew me to this book.  Still it was an enjoyable read.
B005PK56TA|3.0|I really wanted to that piggy man chop him when he says come here piggy piggy pig... Would be fun right?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Having been an avid Stephen King reader for most of my life I often wondered about Danny and this story answers so many questions and more . The journey is epic .... I bought this book the day it came out and couldn't put it down and will probably read it again.... after I read The Shining again. :)
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is highly entertaining! I find myself using it to temporarily remove myself from the day to day grind. Recommend if you like dragons and need an escape from reality every now and then
0307266303|5.0|Exactly as described.  This book was recommended to me by a fellow runner and the reading is not incredibly boring and has been very interesting to learn the search to find the best of the best in runners.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|When i read divergent, i thought it couldn't get better. But then insurgent came out and i was wowed. Then i got Allegiant on the day it came out and i the book literally shattered my heart. It a good way. I thought it was so good, the relationship between tris, Tobias, and they're friends was what i was looking for. And DON'T get me started on the ending of this book. I was seriously in tears when i read it. It surprised me so much and i just couldn't believe it. I thought i read something wrong. Allegiant ia a fantastic book that has a amazingly sad ending that will kill your emotions.  Even though i enjoyed this book, i have to say the first two were better. But the ending of Allegiant will change the way i read those books from now on.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had this pocket edition on the ipad and I so wanna get computer version! Hope they update the hone thing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is super fun and addicting!! It's fun to interact with the horses and to compete. You don't get frustrated or anything  with it.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book describe how habits make you into who you are.  Whether you are rich or poor, happy or sad, can be traced back to your habits.  Practice how or what you want to be until it is a habit.
B0091THRCU|4.0|I ordered a Snugg iPhone 5 case when the phone was first released last year; the current order is my second.<br /><br />The case is very well engineered.  As the name suggests, it fits the phone snugly, and the elastic pull strap works well to remove the phone from the case.  The tight fit for the case means that the phone's profile remains slim and small and allow it to fit easily in my pocket.  The case is made from vinyl -- kind of like the seats on the cars my parents drove in the '70s -- but although the material is obviously artificial, it's nice enough.<br /><br />After about a year, my Snugg case started to come apart -- the vinyl beneath the magnetic pull tab started to wear away, and the piping on the ends of the case came away from the case -- but given how inexpensive the case is, it was an easy decision to order another one.  A proper leather wallet will probably be more durable, but it will also cost about twice as much.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's a good game for people who like my little pony but it does have its problems. Mine's is always has a glitch in it somewhere.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The omniscient narrator &#34;Death&#34; that is with a capital D is incredible. I usually first judge a novel by how the narrator develops the story. All I can say is Bravo. This is a tour de force in narration. I would never think of Death as empathetic, and now I truly have a new vision.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Great for thinking out of the box, excellent game. Just when you think it's impossible you find an inventive solution that makes you wonder if the game developer ever thought of that.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is great!!! I would recommend it to anyone who will<br />not be bothered by a little sadness even though it is funny and happy too.
B008ZVJE3A|3.0|Classic funny. A great take on real world music biz.  Not quite 11 stars, but everyone should watch it. Enjoy it.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|My college aged daughters are the ones that told me about this movie and I'm glad they did.  I love it.  I have watched it several times now that they are both back at school.  I think there's something wrong with these blu ray dvds.  If I pause the movie, I can't continue in the same spot.  I have to get it to restart then fast forward.  I've tried two of these with the same problem.  It's not my player as I don't have the problem with any other dvd.  It's no problem now that I know I can't pause it.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|Love the game but halfway through the background  blacks out and you see all the &quot; hidden&quot; objects. It would of had a 5 star if not for that.
B002U5HKZ6|1.0|I didn't like it. The author was too full of himself. I expected him to find a cape and start flying. Way too long.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I admit that I reluctantly played this game only when my young son downloaded it to his Kindle Fire device because I thought it would just be another 3-match game, but I was pleasantly surprised at how fun it is. I catch myself replaying levels to get all 3 stars before moving onto the next level, because I guess I'm competitive even against myself.  Great fun!
B00871C09S|5.0|Thank you for sending it so quickly! when I learned that Netflix didn't provide this classic movie in they're streaming movie program I was so disappointed and frustrated. But  you came to the rescue and delivered!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I knew the book as great already, but the ending really got me, I hope the movie captures the mixed emotions that the book gives you!
0374533555|3.0|Good topic and content but too long.  Even a good topic gets tediuos after a few hundred pages. I would have preferred a more condensed version.  Or maybe \\"2\\" books.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Cute and entertaining. Creative way of compliling scenes of the nice and simple things in life. Not terribly challenging and teaches first time players well.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love never ever toning to get another game I finally fond my game and so will u when u play it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Doesn't disappoint! I loved it on facebook and now can play easily on or offline. Runs great! Now am hoping pet rescue comes out too!!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|Just couldn't get into this book. Not one of Stephen's best. I've read them all, and this one is at the bottom of my list.
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|This is a masterpiece of carefully chosen artists with diverse talents!!!! I love every track and can listen from the beginning to the end. If you love music - you need this.
B00F3HQMV6|5.0|Definitly one of the best EDM albums of the year.. Krewella is here to stay and i'm a fan! Love it!!
B00FWLTPU8|4.0|I've always loved the &#34;Kaiju&#34; genre of big monsters from Godzilla and Tran-zor Z, to Robotech and Voltron. Pacific Rim is an awesome flick with tons of action. Yes, it's silly at times, but the Producer (Guillermo del Toro) did an excellent job of explaining where the giant monsters come from and why, and why we had to build giant robots to fight them. The acting is what you would expect, the interaction between characters is plausible, and there's only a few silly things that would make you roll your eyes. Overall, this is a great movie - especially if you like the old Godzilla movies.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|David and Goliath Underdogs, Misfits, and the art of Battling Giants is well researched and written. Lot of interesting facts.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|WONDER is a spectacularly and sensitively written book about the courage and grit of a young boy during a year in  middle school. The challenges he overcomes and the triumphs he experiences are inspirational. A must - read for young adolescents and adults who care about raising strong, sensitive children who stand up to bullies.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|A fantastic game! sometimes I worry one of the kids will spend too many of my coins. One wish; have more mini games. love the scratch game but it does get repetitive. recommend!
B00000IMTE|5.0|A piece of history, Blackmore on his own and fronted by RJ Dio, all of the Dio-backed albums were good. When they punked him, they sold out and sounded like ass, commercial ass.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is even more fun to play on my kindle!  the game loads very well and I am having frustrated fun. sometimes I get stuck for awhile lol' LOVE this game<br />The game is a simple match game . As the game moves to different levels; it of course gets harder with more barriers. free but there are certain options to buy cheats recommend
B00E9P959O|4.0|Been a fan of Rush's since 1980. Seen the band live 42 times. So everyone on the Internet complained for well over a decade for this record to come out and be re-mixed and how horrible sounding the original one was....well according to Sound Scan around 19,000 people have purchased this re-mixed version. Rush went out of their way for 19,000 people and the rest are complaining about having to PAY for the re-mix so they are stealing it on file sharing sites. One site has this record illegally downloaded at 43,000 times! Nice way to support the band with your $10 bill. I appreciate the efforts that went into this project and it needed it. Ceiling Unlimited, Freeze, Out of the Cradle, and Earthshine are greatly helped by the re-mix. Worth your 10 bucks. Doubt Rush will re-mix anything ever again though since people would rather illegally download and steal it or stream it on Spotify or Rhapsody.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It is a great app that helps me keep organized with my lists that doesn't make more clutter for me to have to dig through!
B00E5N8DGG|1.0|I was so looking forward to this Blu-Ray. The audio sync is terrible, the band looks tired, the songs and crowd are lifeless and it just boggles the mind how a band who has sold as many records as they have and has as many hits as they do can't seem to stimulate an audience or command stadiums. They play with 2 other bands when they tour and they get sucked into horrible concepts like the Vegas residency which did them no favors. Def Leppard should have hired a new manager 15 years ago. I have been a fan of Def Leppard since 1983...this thing is junk.
B004GFN11A|5.0|Must have app if you are a Wordpress user! Just be careful when working from your mobile device it doesn't always save as a draft but publishes it even when ready.
B004TMLY2I|5.0|Incredible music journey that PT takes us on...and I don't even do drugs! Hopefully one day the band will rejoin to record a new record and this masterpiece will find its way back to the stage. Buy this record!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|just finished this book very interesting story line. loved the characters, will read the rest of the series as soon as I catch up on all my reading.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Mobility Ware has done it again. This game is fun and has lots of options. Also you don't have all the ads that stop the action making you have to press the skip bar or the x. Of all the brand of games out there this one is the best.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|What could be a better read than the true story of heroism in the mountains of Afghanistan by an awe inspiring Navy SEAL?
B00ECUARO8|4.0|it held my interest and it had meaning to it the young boys in it are on their way to stardom!
1476727651|5.0|I have to say that I finished this book in about 3 days and it was a good read. I must confess every time I see a RV or a small group of RVers I think about the ones in this book. It's a great read. Will not spoil it for anyone but it's a must if you read the Shinning. This is just great following dan in this adult life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Omg! I love this game. Just started playing and I can't seem to stop. Should've purchased this game long time ago. I see why my sister was always playing the game. Love it, great game to past time by. Especially if you're stress or kids working your nerves.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|There are no words. None. I am done.<br />Ok, so maybe I have a few words I can share. For instance, I can share how my heart has been ripped out and destroyed. I can share how my love of this series is forever tainted. I can even share that I no longer have shelf space reserved for my hardbacks--which are now looking for a new home.<br />I am distraught.<br />Devastated.<br />In complete awe.<br />** SPOILER ALERT! DO NOT READ THIS SECTION IF YOU HAVE NOT READ ALLEGIANT**<br />You were warned. But in case curiosity got the best of you, let me explain my dramatics. The ending for this book blew me away. I have waited an entire week to share my thoughts, and I still can't come to terms with what I feel. I am beyond words.<br />Veronica Roth took this series to a place I never expected. I admire her brazen decision, but it has left a hole. A deep, everlasting hole. When I read that fateful scene, I could not believe it. I read it, then I reread it because I just knew I was missing something. But then that `something' never came.<br />Am I satisfied? Heck no! I wanted it to be anyone else but her. I didn't even feel complete knowing Tobias was still hanging around.<br />What did I want? I have no idea. All I know is it wasn't what I got! I just can't... ack... ugh<br />*** END SPOILER ALERT**<br />The other thing that really got to me this time around was Tobias. I have enjoyed him so much over the years, but this time he just did not sit well with me. He constantly doubted Tris, and he came across whiny. I can say that having these HUGE character flaws did make the characters so much more believable. So that was a plus.<br />I also didn't mind the alternating points of view. I was pretty excited to see Tobias's side of things. However, by the end, I found him to get on my nerves a bit. I now feel that Veronica Roth's strength is writing strong female leads. I never found myself having a 100% buy in with Tobias.<br />My final rant is the spin the final book took. We finally got to see the full outcome of this dystopian setting. It made sense, and I guess it worked, but... It didn't wow me like I thought it would. Oh, let me also go ahead and say how awful the beginning was. It started right where Insurgent ended, but I was so confused! It's been a year since I read that book. I need some kind of fill in to catch me up on things. Do you know how many books I read in a year?! These plots get muddled, and I do not want to have to reread a book just to make sense of the sequel. I'm thankful she did not info-dump, but I needed some more clues to help me make sense of the very important information being handed to me.<br />Overall, this was alright. I have loved Divergent and Insurgent. They are some of the only books that I have pre-ordered. I have counted down release days with digital timers and Facebook updates. And now I feel horribly let down. I wish I would have just waited to read Allegiant when it arrived at my library. I do not know if my reaction has more to do with the high expectations I had for the book, or the outcome of the plot. Either way, it left me conflicted.nally got to see the full outcome of this dystopian setting. It made sense, and I guess it worked, but... It didn't wow me like I thought it would.

B00FI7XBIS|5.0|love this game. passes time really well. got it in the app of the day and. I was lucky. well worth 1.99$
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Because it ONLY works with youtube and netflix. If I want to go to other sites I can not watch or view the website. Its sucks. I thought I can use my TV as a monitor for my laptop.
B00CO8TBR4|5.0|I always buy Intel i5 for my gaming PCs. Affordable and enough for gaming, since most computing for games is done in GPU (graphic card), not in CPU.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|Absolutely obsessed with this album! Vocals remind me of Damien Rice in a grabs-my-heart-immediately kind of way and the guitar picking is beautiful! I don't consider folk to be my primary music genre of choice but this album can't be ignored!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun, challenging, and just a wee bit addictive. I'm actually glad you run out of lives and have to wait for new ones. It gets me away from the game for awhile! Haven't run across any bugs thus far.
B00AFPTSI0|4.0|Grant is thorough and convincing with research based evidence to support his point of view.<br /><br />I normally don't write reviews, but the book  inspired me to let my giver out a little more.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As with many King stories this started out a little slow with a long introduction to the main charactor. Once I got into the story I did not want to put it down. Classic KIng.
B009EE6OGW|5.0|Absolute classic!  One of the creepiest,  most frightening movies ever! Alien hd will entertain  you and friends every time you watch it!!
0316055433|5.0|It is hard to review this book and add anything to the reviews already presented here.  This is a deeply engrossing novel about one character's very complex life.  I thoroughly enjoyed every part of this novel.  The main character, Theo, does not always make the best choices for his situation but the author allows us to feel his emotions with clarity and understand the choices he makes, some good some bad.  The reader does not have to agree with Theo but one does feel a strong empathy in each of his dilemmas and therefore the author presents the reader with a good deal of moral questioning that stays with one long after the book is finished.  Yes, it was a very long novel and yes it could have been shortened but why??  Does one read to race to the end of a story or to be immersed in the expertise of the writer to tell a complex story?  Some reviewers did not enjoy the story at all and found it depressing but do we read only things that make us comfortable or to we sometimes want a book that tests our complacency in life?? I will be thinking about Theo and his friends for a long time - well done!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very fun!!!!!<br />very.  very.  very.  fun.  worth getting for sure. does run a little slow but very playable. 5 stars for sure.....
B003G4W49C|3.0|In the end, I was disappointed with the ending of Ender's Game. It's like Card didn't know when to stop writing so it just wandered off mumbling into distant space. Friends built this book up like it was a really fantastic book and it was riveting to read up to the part where you discover that the games weren't really just games. After that, it seems to lose focus and clumsily tries to tie up loose ends.
B00EHMG358|5.0|I could not put the book down - I am looking forward to the rest of it. I like books that have bright intelligent females in them.  I<br />also like the author - his writing is a pleasure to read!!
B0042GIRYE|5.0|The Zac Brown Band are one of my favorite groups. Every song is a gem. I rarely purchase an album. This was one I bought right when it came out.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I hadn't listed to all of the songs for years.  The sound quality was excellent!  Brought back many memories from my youth.
B003XDZN8A|1.0|Did not like these. Loved the style - looked really cute. Wore them 15 minutes and had a blister where the side button attaches on inside and outside of foot.  Wouldn't recommend...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|glad to finally get it on my kindle! love this game very addictive wish you could accumulate more lives in the game
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Love this book.  Couldn't put it down.  The writing is pure poetry.  I've already recommended it to several friends. I want to read it again!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|My wife and I love this show. The relationships, action and drama are so good. Can't wait for next Sunday.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is so &agrave;ddicting. its so fun and time passing game. this game is something I would reccomend to if you are looking for a time passer and something to get addicted to
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|**I have updated this review after 5 days of use. See Below.**<br /><br />I love the look and feel of this mouse. I was a little surprised at the size, but I got mostly used to it. If you find yourself having a hard time using it, try adjusting your posture! (That was my problem!)<br /><br />My favorite part of this mouse is the fact that it's side buttons do not interfere with normal browsing! This is a must for me because my home PC is my gaming station as well as my productivity station! The buttons are also incredible useful to program hot-key operations, such as double and triple clicking (Double click to highlight a work, triple click to highlight a paragraph, etc). The mouse-wheel is fluid, but you wont find yourself accidentally rolling it (too often).<br /><br />Lastly, the braided cable is a godsend! It is really nice to not have to worry about twisting the cable too much when you are organizing your work space for optimal cleanliness (cable management) and it was long enough to stick under my desk along my HDMI cable to the PC.<br /><br />**Update**<br /><br />After 5 days of use, I see that this mouse is not as good as I thought. The space where you put your thumb is much too slippery. I find it difficult to hold the mouse without my hand slipping back and forth. I may be able to keep using the mouse if I tape a paper towel to the thumb \\"grip\\" to add some friction, but that seems ridiculous. -3 stars for this unless I can find some other work around. Rethink your choice about this mouse!<br /><br />**Update #2**<br /><br />Added a start because Anker contacted me suggesting a replacement if my thumb rest is non-reconcilable. Depending on how fast they handle the situation and if it is just an issue with this specific mouse, I will adjust the score.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|So intense! An ending that you hate to love....but you do. Finished  in a way that describes real life. Not a fairy tale.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|An abundance of Katherines explores relationships, questions intelligence, and has an inside look of the lives of 3 completely different teenagers.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very challenging.  Can get frustrating when you can not find that last clue. The app will keep you busy for a long time.

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Review of &#34;The Zealot&#34;<br /><br />True to it's premise of investigating and reporting the political and social times.  A very good description of what was going on in the context of the historical Jesus.  Corruption was rampant and the Romans and the Jewish leaders were &#34;in charge&#34;,  The Romans and King Herod were brutal and the people suffered accordingly.  A good read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game and take it from me and I'm 10 they'll probably make it just like the real minecraft
0847842134|5.0|I've been fascinated with the Codex since I first came across the FMR edition at a small bookshop in Valletta in the 1980s. This edition is very similar to the edition Rizzoli published in 2006, which was distributed exclusively in Italy. The cover is identical, and it is printed on the same luxuriously thick, Italian paper. The chief difference lies in ten additional pages in the beginning that Mr. Serafini contributed for this edition, as well as a newly re-written Decodex. The 2006 edition came with a small pamphlet containing various essays in different languages on the Codex, while in this this addition, the Decodex is limited to a single essay written by Luigi Serafini and translated into English, French, German, Spanish, and Russian. Rizzoli New York has done a fine job reprinting this book for the American market, and would be a fine addition to any book lover's library.   Unfortunately, I had purchased this books as a Christmas gift for my brother-in-law but Amazon never notified me they ran out-of-stock. You're better off purchasing a copy through an independent bookstore or on alibris.com.  If you're looking to obtain one of the strangest books ever published, you're better off buying the Codex elsewhere.  Five stars for the book, zero for Amazon.
B0047TLRJI|5.0|Joe satriani is right up there with the very best . This compilation belongs in any music lovers catalog .
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Over the years in my work as a Speech Pathologist I have had the pleasure of spending time with many people on the autism spectrum. The Rosie Project brought back many fond memories. I read &#34;Rosie&#34; on a plane trip from Sydney to Rome and laughed and laughed. The time just disappeared without my noticing. So good to embrace the differences in people and this story does just that with such warmth and humour. This story can be enjoyed simply because it is an amusing diversion and/or to gain insight into how someone may perceive differently & perhaps have an even clearer handle on things than many of the rest of us do. This was so much fun to read.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This game is fun. I really like how they give you the video too. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the you tube video.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Great cooler. My stock temp went from 39-41 deg under load for i3570k intel processor to 33 degrees under load. The cooler is large so if  you're planning on using all four slots for your memory then use low profile memories.
B009CG29RK|5.0|Love this movie!  I can watch it again and again and it never gets old!  Great for adults and kids alike.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Even better than I thought it would be. I thought I would at least use it some, but now I use it all the time
B00CHVJI08|3.0|Wasn't as entertaining as I expected, grand children loved it, toy wasn't what I thought it would be, expected a stuffed toy
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the first book, and enjoyed the second. I anxiously awaited this book, and even prepurchased it. When it finally came, I dived in and began to try to remember what I liked about the first books. Whatever drew me to the first books, just didn't seem to be here. Tobias was lackluster compared to Four. The plot didn't draw me in and simply wasn't worth the wait. This ending makes me wish books could have an alternate ending like movies.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|TRULY A GREAT CD, I'VE NEVER TRULY LISTENED 2 COUNTRY BUT I REALLY LOVE THIS CD, I ENJOYED ALL OF THE SONGS BUT LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THE ONE TITLED LOST IN YOU
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|Such a funny, entertaining, and family friendly movie the whole Family will love! Refreshing and new! I recommend to everyone!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Great book to read.  It is one of the books that the HBO mini series &#34;The Pacific&#34; was based on.  It is a very good read and give you appreciation of what the servicemen in that combat theater went through.  Highly recommended.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Love this app. Makes it so much easier to type without lifting finger. New Android keyboard tries to incorporate some of its features
B00BD99JMW|4.0|SPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS!<br /><br />I think some people are over-reacting about the ending. I didn't hate it. There were other things about the book that bothered me.<br /><br />Things I disliked:<br />1. Adding in Four’s POV. Yes, I know why she did it - because Tris was gonna die and we needed to know what happened after - but it’s a pet peeve of mine for Authors change up POV’s in the last book. If we remove the novellas, which I don’t count because they technically aren’t necessary to read to understand the plot and are just “extra”, then we’ve never heard Four’s POV before. Since Veronica has said that she planned the ending from the beginning, it would have made more sense, IMO, to add in his voice at least in Insurgent. For one thing, to a smart reader, and there are plenty, suddenly adding in another POV when we’ve only seen Tris’s is a dead give away that Tris will die or something will happen to her. Again, just my opinion. I do believe that a writer can do what they wish with their story, but also that I’m not allowed to like it. Also, Four didn't seem to be any different from Tris. It was easy to get mixed up in who was speaking, and that's not cool because they are definitely different characters.<br /><br />2. Basically the whole plot of the book. I know that’s pretty broad, but I basically just didn’t like that both the POV characters were completely removed from what was happening in Chicago. I mean…? It’s not that I don’t think that what happened outside is not important, but it just seemed strange to have the events of the city that we’ve spent 2 books getting to know be far removed, experienced only by characters watching what was happening on t.v. screens.<br /><br />3. Pacing. Perhaps it was just me, but it seemed that there was very little exposition. It was just constantly things happening. I thought that the idea that they were a grand experiment in “gene repair” was a great idea, but the idea wasso big that I don’t think it got properly handled. This is the same thing that happened in Mockingjay for me. I mean, the war basically started and ended in the same book and it just felt rushed for me (Mockingjay that is). I think that there are plenty of things that could have been explored if Veronica had perhaps either made the book longer, or better yet, written it into a fourth book. Dont’ get me wrong, I don’t plots that overstay their welcome, but the rushing about, and the fact that this new form of racism (“genism” if you will) was only partially dealt with, having only one facility’s people get their minds erased, etc…it just didn’t work for me. It was too rush and underexplained.<br /><br />4. I wasn’t really thrilled with Tobias’s story arc. Maybe it’s because we hadn’t ever been inside his head, but to me he didn’t seem to be acting like himself. His reaction to finding out about his “damaged genes” seemed very OOC to me…maybe I’m the one.<br /><br />Things I liked:<br />1. Caleb’s story arc. I was really devastated in Insurgent when he sold Tris out, so I liked that over time he really came to feel guilty about what he had done. I like that there was some redemption to his character and that he didn’t get to choose the “easy way out”.<br /><br />2. Peter’s story arc. Peter is such a dispicable character that I found it extremely interesting that he was aware of how dispicable he was and that he wanted to do something about it. I also found it interesting that even after he was reset, he still showed the same tendencies, showing that his personality did have a “nature” aspect to it, rather than just “nurture”.<br /><br />3. Tris’s death. I KNOW RIGHT? I must be a crazy person to like that, but I did. Some of my reasons are plot/writing, and some are just…idk, I liked it. The plot/writing reasons are simply that I appreciate that Veronica had a plan and she stuck to it, no matter how scared or worried she might have been about reader reaction. She didn’t deviate from her plan, and that almost always lends itself to better writing. I also appreciated that Tris realized that Caleb wasn’t just doing this out of love, but as a matter of basically suicide, and she wasn’t going to let him do it. It showed that no matter what happened between them, Tris still valued him as her blood relative (and also she in a way got her revenge by not only denying him the satisfaction of dying, but  leaving him behind to deal with everyone’s anger at Tris dying when that wasn’t the plan.) There are a number of ways that Veronica could have ended her story without Tris dying, I definitely believe that, but in the end, I thought it was brave for both writer and character.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this app! Great for adults and children. It's adorable with the cat in the load up screen. Love how it's not slow. Doesn't take long to load anything
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I have this app on my phone as well and it's great!!! Download and you won't be sorry. I run it a few times a day to close all apps and to clear cache.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Pretty much a mediocre product at best. Streaming Netflix from Chrome on the Mac hangs at 25% and does nothing for hours at a time yet the same video plays fine on the desktop client. If you try and cast the Netflix tab, it won't use audio unless you use the Cast from Netflix, which then resets and... hangs at 25%. I have been able to Cast an Xfinity video page and watch it, so it's not a worthless product, but I can do that on-demand already (did it as a test to see what would happen). Not a total waste of $35, but pretty close.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and Amazon Videos won't work full screen, nor will it push audio. My sub-par rating might be too high. This is getting less useful by the minute.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Really good movie up until the ending.  Definitely worth watching, but the ending kind of falls apart.  Samuel L Jackson is great, definitely a show-stealer!
0984074422|5.0|I heard the authors speak when I stumbled upon an exhibit of this project that had just opened at the Nobel Peace Center in Oslo. The concept is intriguing- to analyze by cost, calories, etc., what families eat in different countries around the world. The photography of the families with their week's worth of food is wonderful- telling the story in photos as well as text. It's not the type of book I'd read from start to finish, but I've left it on the kitchen counter, and &#34;dip into&#34; it from time to time. I continue to be interested and have learned much. By the way, I ordered the book from Amazon for a much lower cost than if I'd purchased it at the exhibit, and it was waiting for me when I arrived home.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Boring, slow, dud of a movie.  After all the hype, I was looking forward to a great period drama and was terribly disappointed.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Rocky is one of the greatest movies ever seen.  It makes you feel that no matter how hard you may feel that life is not going just right for you,  there is something inside you that makes you want to fight back and make it right.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Not the most entertaining game ever, but good for killing time sitting in a waiting room.  Probably better for little kids. Just OK.
B000OT6V00|5.0|Hellboy is a fun movie to watch.  Ron Perlman is excellent as Hellboy along with the great supporting cast around him.  I am sure anyone will enjoy this movie.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Lots of recognizable names and faces.  Good story, fast-paced and entertaining date night movie at home.  Not too predictable.  Fun movie!
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Superb film. If you like this genre of films, this one I would recommend. Clint Eastwood did a great job.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Good movie to watch if you're in the mood for a woman-empowering flick.  A little bit dark, but the torture scenes are not nearly as bad as I had anticipated.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Easy to identify &amp; delete junk files. Even when you uninstall some apps, sometimes remnants of that app are left behind &amp; waste memory.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Helen Hunt is great, as always.  Thoughtful & tear-jerking movie.  Definitely a love story, however unexpected.  A good date night movie.  This one makes you think.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row is one of Grisham best novels.  Great book, characters, and plot. Loved every moment of this book a definite page turner.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|I didn't think they could top The Suburbs. I was wrong and they did. This is another great AF album!
B00E6895M6|5.0|I have been hearing them on the radio. Then saw them on TV in concert and was blown away. Revolutionary band with a great singer that grounds them to be able to be a pop-synth band that is going to blow up the airwaves.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|An instant classic, this movie is amazing. If you somehow haven't seem it yet you must must watch it! It's so easy to become attached to these characters.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was waiting for this to be available on my Kindle HD. And now I'm addicted. Very fun game and linked to my Facebook account. Love it!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Good drama. Characters you like and hate keeps you interested. Little more geared toward women but acceptable for men. Needed more words.
1412960991|5.0|A lot of information, technical but easy to read. it goes to the point. It helps understanding both the reasons to select a case study and the details of how to design it. Good examples and tables
B001RIY4WE|4.0|Loved this movie growing up.  The effects were ahead of its time. Sub par quality,  Great DTS sound.  For what I paid i am happy with my purchase.
B000002MIY|4.0|I was into Steely Dan when they 1st came out in the 1970s with \\"Can't Buy a Thrill\\" but I never knew the main singer's name. Now I do; but I am not allowed to spell his last name in Amazon.com & this is his 2nd solo album called \\"Kamakiriad\\". Can you call a CD an album? I still buy LPs & I call those albums. The 1st song \\"Trans-Island Skyway\\" threw me off because it had a 1970ish Gentle Giant \\"Free Hand\\" off beat rhythm that I thought I was going to get some real progressive rock on this CD. The other songs flow into the good but typical Steely Dan funky Jazz Rock with horns & saxophones. I read that this \\"IS\\" a Steely Dan CD in all but name due to Donald (Last Name) writing all the songs with only a help on a few. The album (there I go again with the word Album) is a story about a future car & its journey:  something of a small concept album (I give up). Okay I guess I have more Donald (Last Name) CDs to buy to add to my Steely Dan collection.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Pitt usually does a good job and it's nice to see him play a character that's not quirky.  The zombies were a little bit of a let down, they move too fast.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. Four stars for better than average.  CGI was nice.  Zombies were the biggest let down.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Too sad<br />This is a teenage book?<br />So waiting for the end and then this depressing book and lengthy details on factions.first two were better
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|Does everything a good Freecell game should but it seems to take up a lot of memory on my Kyocera Rise. There are times when the game freezes. I assume it's because of the cool animation effects but I run high end audio programs and they have slight latencey problems but they never stop. I doubt if you'd have a problem if you're phone is powerful. I was quite surprized by this issue though.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game is awesome.  I hope my friends have this app because it is awesome your idea was brilliant brilliant I say.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Written in fresh style easily understandable also for people who do not understand physics. A lot of new physical knowledge collected in a popular, yet not superficial manner. Very anti-religious book though not written for such a purpose. After reading you will not understand why people need God - therefore I would not suggest the book to religious person :-) It will harm his/her belief.<br />Lawrence Krauss also shows that cosmology need not to be just a philosophical (or metaphysical) enterprise but it fits into current modern and exact science perfectly as well.
B007G5O3K0|4.0|Surprisingly good. Wasn't sure what to expect as i hadn't heard anything from him for quite a few years but this was a great listen with some really strong songs on there.
B00C2C637I|4.0|Reminds me of a Stephen King novel, Needful Things. Although I'm sure this novel would have been inspiration for King 's macabre tale. Bradbury wraps an intriguing allegory underneath his scary story. I have wanted to read Bradbury book's since he passed away in 2012, and this was a rewarding start to an exploration of his many great works of fiction.
B007R6X9IK|4.0|Love Dave and Depeche Mode so was always going to love this. Have found DM's latest albums a bit patchy and this is probably the same. But a good listen none the less.
0385537131|3.0|Sycamore Row was conceptualized in May of 2013, according to what I have been able to find out. Does anyone think it a coincidence that Grisham decided to write a \\"sequel\\" to A Time To Kill just five months after the real victim that inspired that book comes forward and publishes her story? The Still Before Dawn by Suzanne McConnell was published in January 2013. I am the author of that book. I spent ten years trying to find out the details of my own story because John Grisham would not respond to my letters asking him to help me unravel the truth. I have never wished him anything but goodness but he has now used my coming forward and is trying to over shadow, yet again, my own true story for his own benefit. I had to publish my book as a fictional autobiography because I was just a child when these things happened and my memories have been so fragmented over the years. If I am correct, and my story is the one that inspired him, then he was an adult who was present at a trial where I gave testimony, a testimony I can only remember in fragments. I would like to know the name of the man and if he was convicted, especially since the people who really hurt me were never prosecuted. So, am I impressed with Sycamore Row? It is a great book. Grisham is a good fiction writer, but I am not convinced that he is a good human being, I'd like to think he is. He made a huge amount of money off the sensational nature of what happened to me, yet he has not had the decency to even contact me or to help me unravel something he knows a lot about because he was there. The least he could do is help me speak out about what happened to me and perhaps assist in advocating for children who suffer from the kind of abuse described in my book. You see, I wasn't raped and discarded by strangers and my father most certainly did not come to my defense. So, I do take somewhat of an offense to the book A Time to Kill as I do this new venture which I feel in some way continues the exploitation.
B00B9YDT5Y|5.0|Fantastic. As far as Greatest Hits goes, this is just awesome. So many songs - nothing missing and lots of extras!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|super cute and fun game. easy to learn but challenging. A great game for all ages.  I recommend it highly for anyone looking for something quick but don't think it will be that quick...once your sucked in there's no going back......
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is a masterful writer and with this novel, following-up on the son in 'The Shining', again brings personal experience to the story.
B00CD36FF6|4.0|Interesting studies and observations, explains a number of my personal ideas but there were some surprises. Should be applied to more of our day to day interactions.
B008OJ291W|3.0|There is crackling and hissing in some of the songs (10538 Overture for example).  Very disappointing if you have a decent set of headphones.
B009A9ERA6|5.0|This was my first foray into In This Moment and I was not disappointed! From the harder 'Blood' and Comanche' to the more mellow 'The Blood Legion (Legion)' and '11:11', this album does not fail to deliver. I find myself listening on a daily basis.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|I could not get past the first few pages. The writing is so primary and does not flow for me.  Very disappointing.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|I didn't know this was such a love story. A poetic tale about optimism in a time of obscene wealth where  sadly, those who had did not know how to define themselves outside of their financial value.  The loss of human empathy due to abundance and social status. This was sadly moving and an inspiring beautiful film.
1422188612|5.0|Just started to read the book. Love it so far. It outlines strategies and things to avoid for new leaders. I definitely recommend it.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|love love love this show! great writing and acting and I love going to Miami when I watch this series love the colors!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this to download on my Kindle and I am so excited it is here.  This game gets harder at each level but not so hard that it can't be completed...it keeps you coming back for more!!! I also like the notification when you get the full lives again so I don't have to keep checking...give it a try you won't be disappointed....besides it's free!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Great for kids. Graphics are really good. It surprised me for a free game. Worth the download. I lost track of time just checking the game out.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian will definitely kick your booty in this video but it is well worth it. Great workout for the price!
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Jack Reacher was nothing like I expected it to be. The previews made this film look like a comedy, featuring some bad ass cop that doesn't play by the rules. The film itself couldn't be more different from how it was packaged and I think that's why it didn't do as well as it could have at the box office. The character, Jack Reacher, comes from a series of novels and the film is taken directly from one of the books. Strangely enough, they didn't choose the first book written to introduce us to the character, but one written much later. Reacher has spent his whole life in the military and retired as a military police detective. He had enough of not really helping those who deserved help and went off the grid. Now, Reacher only shows up when someone is in need of his help and in this film, that person is a former suspect of his. Reacher knows the man is guilty, but doesn't think he'd do this horrible crime on his own and he goes to investigate. The film was fast-paced and had an interesting story to tell, but they don't let us figure anything out! Jack Reacher has all the answers and tells us everything we need to know and how he figured it out way before we did. I get it, he's some kind of police savant, but it really is frustrating. I love a good mystery and the allure is in figuring it out on my own, but this film never gave me the chance. Tom Cruise stars and fans of the book series were mortified by the choice of producers to have him star as Reacher. I don't care much for Cruise either, but the fans protest had to do with the book describing him as a 6'7 powerhouse. Well who would they rather have had play Jack Reacher, The Rock? This was a major, high budget film, and it needed a big name. Cruise actually does a decent job and was very believable, as was the story, but the one major drawback for me was just how little was left to the imagination.
B00G32OER4|5.0|This film was simply astonishing.  I watched it alone in the middle of the night and had to turn the lights on about halfway through.  People tend to scoff at horror movies, as if they are somehow easier to make than other genres, but when they're done well it is  my assertion that they involve more craftsmanship.  The direction was sublime and the acting was great, especially considering the youth of some of the cast.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Show has a good story acting and is realistic.  I can not believe I did not watch it until this year.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun, addictive, challenging! The only down side: the asking for $$$ to get you to continue playing instead of having a &#34;time out&#34;.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love the attention to detail and realism from the movie. It is cool they added the characters to guide mission. Just wish we could earn coins and money quicker.<br /><br />Liza
0307279189|5.0|Anybody that is into running and or want to start running will be in love with this book. A must, you will read it from beginning to the end without stopping and right after you would go for a run
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Fast easy read. Took a few chapters to straighten out who was who as far as characters go.  Would highly recommend it
B0050UEVNM|5.0|The stories were interesting, the way things came together was a surprise, and the actors were great.  It's a nice movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax.  Recommended.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I wish Amazon would allow people to update the game sooner. We have to wait months after the Update has come out.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was a quick read for me because I couldn't put it down. I just had to know how tiffany and pats story was going to end. This is a great story about true friendship.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I like this game but it's hard to get cool new armors.<br />Also I think you should be able to do combat in air and land.<br />So I rate this app to 3 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|it's a fun game, Once you get to level 35, you have to pay to advance or play quests. Thats ok but when you fail a quest you have to wait 18 to 24 hours to try again!!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I was stuck with playing they're reloaded deer hunt, which I would never recommend, when I found this and downloaded it. It is one of the best apps I have ever played.
0316074314|5.0|I rarely purchase a book by an \\"unknown\\" author that is longer than 400 pages lest I waste my time getting through the entire novel to find that it was not worth the purchase.<br />I chose to do this opposite based on credible reviews and do not regret it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Indulgent addiction.  I think I was the last in my family to download this game.  It is very entertaining and you don't have to spend any money, if you don't want to.

B007BLCGNU|4.0|Leonardo DiCaprio stars as the title character in a film that opens with a writer (Agent Smith) working with Hoover to document the FBI's early years, beginning in 1919. At that time Mitchell Palmer was Attorney General and suffers an assassination attempt - he's unharmed but Hoover sees police handling of the crime scene as primitive and needing the backing of criminal science. Palmer then charges Hoover with a new anti-radical division.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Hoover proposes to his new secretary, Helen Gandy, but the rebuffs him. She does, however, agree to become his personal secretary and fills that role until his death. When Palmer is replaced, Hoover is made director of the Justice Department's Bureau of Investigation. Later, investigating the Lindbergh kidnapping, Hoover introduces tracing bills - a technique that lead to the arrest and conviction of Bruno Hauptmann.<br /><br />The film also addresses Hoover's alleged homosexuality, and his secret to job longevity - gathering dirt on those in power, including Mrs. Roosevelt and President Kennedy.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I thought the movie was really well thought out. There were a lot of twists and things you do not see coming. Honestly it was one of the best Matthew McConaughey's movies. I was thoroughly impressed.
B003EY7IRC|3.0|I was disappointed in the ending. Not in what happened but the fact that it just sort of ended rather abruptly. Good series an good book but the ending could have been better!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|\\"The Innocent\\" could be used as one of the best examples of what it takes to make a reader interested in your work. In the very beginning we meet Will Robie who makes his living ending life. \\"Who wants to idolize an assassin?\\" I asked myself but within a very few pages I cared very much for Robie. The supporting characters are also \\"people\\" the reader can care about and the \\"bad guys\\" are deffenitly that.<br />A great story with an open ending that can (and does) lead to a future Will Robie story.<br />I'm impressed with almost all of Baldacci's work but this one tops the list.<br />D.M. McGowan<br />Author.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book held my interest from beginning to end. The characters were believable and the interaction between them captivated me.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Does exactly what I expect it to do.  I just wish it would turn itself on and off depending on whether there was a signal.
1452126577|4.0|Funny and cute - great for a couple laughs - but very short.  Don't buy unless you REALL like cats.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is great. Play candy crush during my leisure time.  Am taking my time with it.  Keep on surprising everyone
B002ZB26AO|5.0|A gripping, well written insight into the everyday challenges and traumas facing the people in North Korea. By talking about a range of people and their lives, loves, joys and struggles, Demick makes it easy to relate to people whose circumstances are dramatically different from my own.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Good relaxing fun.  Don't have to be an astronaut, as long as you can separate luck from game reality.  Some of my friends are addicted, and I tell them I refuse to be addicted, I refuse to be addicted, I refuse....
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|Great feminist novel, written by a man. The first book was the best. Love the Salander character. Worth the read.
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game is decent, but the tutorial doesn't explain hardly anything. Trucks seem to only be able to handle one task - hardly a 'route'. The game unlocks environment stuff super slow and it doesn't display prices when buying items via quest or on upgrades.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|As always I was in the mood. Jumping up and down at the action. Crying at the sad parts. And clapping at the end. It was great. See you later.<br /><br />AwesomeCAVE
B007Q476KU|5.0|Beautifully filmed. Plot followed book well. Stunts were awesome! I view it as an antiwar film. Loved the teary ending. Joey deserved an Oscar! Will buy dvd for my collection!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|GREAT game but I think it's a scam to have you pay for extras and also at some points in the game to even continue playing!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The actors are fabulous even when the plot isn't at it best they bring out their best! This program brings a history and life style to television watchers that have only a hint of this world.
B00A2H9P98|1.0|This is a re-make of a re-make that they re-made again just with new characters and a new location, I think Kurt Russell did something like this too about 20 years ago only it was in an airplane...maybe they can try something like this on the moon or maybe Mars, then maybe my brain would let me watch it.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Stay away from this product!  The worst experience ever.  Purchased a game for my son because of this \\"great deal\\" they were offering.  All they want is your cc info, so they can store it in there system (Without your permission!!) And then watch out!  After contacting my cc company and reporting these fraudulant charges.  I contacted this company.  Right away the rep was a total smart###.  For starters, if this company was not a racket, they would not allow a rep to talk to their customers in this way.  Literally mocking me and smarting off to everthing I had a complaint with.  I just want to warn every parent out there:  Stay away from this company!!!  Not worth it!!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I just got this app and I love it. You can customize it to fit your liking. It is amazing.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|It's beautifully written and extremely thought-provoking because the author comes from such a scientific background.  It gave me that visceral sense of reading the Truth.  If nothing else, his story is amazing!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Super excited I get to download a legit full version of candy crush saga!!!!!  What the he'll took so long?!  Now all we need is instagram!! =)
B0030GJ50C|5.0|this movie is a must see ! ! This movie has better graphics than Pacific Rim and the story line is so original. . . The starting is off beat , but stay tuned because it is as good as a modern day \\"Star Wars\\" ! !
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This was the final book in the trilogy and I have to say it was my least favorite. Maybe it was because I read it with so much time in between the other ones, but it didn't have the same flair as the other ones did. I had a harder time imagining the fringe area and some of the people were a little harder to recall. I liked the story,but not the ending. It was a little disappointing.
1905492073|3.0|The book is written for European divers.  All numerical references are in metrics.  It would have been more helpful for a US reader if calculations and measurements were shown also in US values.  When I write something along this lines I show the US equal numbers also - as such as 100 mmHg (0.1316 ATA).  The book was obviously written for the average technical SCUBA diver, so as a professional I found it lacking.  It is well written and does express complex medical conditions in plain English.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Love Paul's new cd---best I think, since his Beatle days!  Play this everyday on the way to work, and home, plus the downloaded amazon cloud version!
B004JMY312|5.0|This movie one of my all time favorite Halloween movies! Wish they had made a sequel, but I guess just one movie will have to do.
B0081KTHEQ|2.0|Far too many horror film cliches, e.g. wind-up toys that start by themselves, and Daniel Radcliffe just can't act. The poor guy stares blankly through most of the movie, hoping we'll attach some meaning to it. The premise is faulty as well. A ghost woman who lost her child is taking revenge on all the children of the village. Yet most of the villagers are blameless. She needs a better complaint, or at least some culpable targets for her wrath.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it.  Seemed to move through quickly, definitely left me wanting more.  I am about to start the last book.  I can't wait for the movie.  The Hunger Games stayed pretty close to the book, although the book explained a lot of things better.  I did feel like Katniss was portrayed a lot more confused and self centered in this book.  I'll be curious to see where the third book takes her character!
030758836X|3.0|The reviews are spot on. It is suspenseful, intriguing and mostly well written. The characters are fascinating and multifaceted.  BUT. The ending is so incredibly unsatisfying. I wish I had never read it.
B002S45V32|4.0|Really good hi def quality and love the fact that captions are finally an option. Movie brings back a lot of memories!

B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|If you enjoy games with mini puzzles, searching for items, and lots of fun, you will really like this game. Super grahics and character interaction.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Great Read! Tremendous insight into life in Mississipi and the South in general. This novel is the precursor to<br />Sycamore Row, another great novel. Could not turn the pages fast enough...!
B00DBSZ6ZC|2.0|too graphic for our taste. It could have done without some of the gory details such as exploding eyeballs. The story line could have used a bit more development as well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's addicting!  Thought I was addicted to other games, but this is the best.  Can't wait to get new lives when I use  them all.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Highlights the highlights of the book and brings to life the flashiness of the '20s. Leo is the perfect Gatsby and the difference between legitimate money and the bootleggers is wonderfully highlighted
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I enjoyed it and it made me want to read more of her books.  I will suggest this to other people.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Great show, I love watching the cast there is always a little laughter mixed in and the story line with Castle and Kate has really been fun to watch.
B0012DZ356|5.0|Heard that Alice Munro can capture the essence/mood/feelings in her short stories and all the rumors were right.  Alice Munro knows how to cultivate the feelings of her characters and make you totally understand what they are going through.  She puts down in words all of our human feelings.
B003L77FYS|5.0|It's my favorite show. The cast is perfect together and I like that it has a touch of comedy too.,
1587143879|5.0|Beautiful. 10 stars out 5 to the vendor. Yes, 10 out of 5. I appreciate the good customer service. My books were supposed to be here in approximately 8 days but it was in my possession in 3 days. Thank you so much and I hope all those reading this comment consider your business. These books are the best; I recommend them to those serious about the CCNA. Good luck to all.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What a sick, terrifying story! Stephen King is one great writer of horror novels. I enjoyed&#34;Doctor Sleep&#34;, the sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34;, so much, that I had to buy the latter immediately.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|So I bought this watch thinking it would be impervious to an EMP...nope...further investigation reveals that unless the watch is a true &#34;windup&#34;, then it will have a small capacitor in it. I love the watch though, so don't get me wrong, I don't regret this purchase.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|maybe it can be made a little easier to operate when you connect it is very difficult to operate this should be made easier  however it is a great product and it is free..
B001HNE3NO|4.0|If I had known it was sooo sad, I wouldn´t have read it. I still can´t take out of my mind some of the terrible images that I imagined while reading its pages.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|it is a good fps game, I never play a game like that - I like very much this game
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|in order to get bonus candies,  extra lives, or unlock more episodes you have to pay. some levels are impossible to pass unless you pay.

B0028RXXE8|5.0|I love this series. Came on time. I have had a great time watching Rome kick butt and take names. Amazing.
B002361MLA|5.0|thought-provoking. Make every moment sacred and your spiritual life will change. That's the message. Everyone is always trying to teach everyone else. This book makes you understand you are the student, not the teacher.
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|The movie was everything I remember and more.  The special features were great also.  This is an extreme well made movie.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Here is a simple answer to your sharpening needs. This makes it very very easy. I have this in my little carry bag for EDC... I know strange right but it's so dang light.
B00ECLU346|1.0|I simply couldn't understand this embarrassing movie. John Goodman and Ken Jeong provided few funny moments, but that's all. It really doesn't worth a nickel.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very intriguing, a well schemed plot, you keep wondering where it is heading to, Very interesting as usual. very John Grisham.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|As one friend said to me: \\"Whoa, Moon Nazis? Sounds cool, dude!\\". It's honest entertainment, just turn off your brain and enjoy.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game has it all once I got it I could not stop playing it Day and night I would recommend this to any one
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book makes so much sense.  I've always had trouble getting leaner using the &#34;eat less, move more&#34; philosophy.  I'm excited to give this a try.
B007HC3LHS|1.0|The  book was full of suspense and I enjoyed it.<br />I was angry at times that Catherine allowed herself to be bullied so much, that seems very unusual for a modern day woman.  However, the story is credible and has a happy ending.<br /><br />I give it a rating of 8 out 10.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Lots of twists. Hard to figure out. That's difficult to find in today's books. Read it in one day. Really enjoyed it

1451696191|5.0|Bought it as a BD gift for my granddaughter who really, really wanted it.  I read it after she did and was impressed with how appropriate it is for a teenager.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Easy game to learn and is rellay fun. A great game to pass the time. Clear rules and tips makes easy to move from stage to stage :)
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Note it &amp; code it with colours. Just a great app. when you use it you'll realize the benefits.  Syncing's easy between your devices too!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Good game for needed distraction. Sometimes it is a little frustrating, but, above all, good, clean, fun. Would highly recommend to all.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I'm a long time fan of this series. The insight from Lee on his thought process in developing the Reacher character was enjoyable.
B003Y5H542|1.0|I wasn't watching this with children, so I can't comment on whether or not kids like it, and I wouldn't rate a movie poorly based on whether it was appropriate for children or not. The reason I'm giving it one star is because I genuinely didn't enjoy the movie at all. I hated the style of animation and overall aesthetic of the movie. I also found it to be boring to the point of nearly falling asleep. It's an extremely bizarre movie overall - not difficult to understand, just bizarre. I'm not exactly the type who prefers a dumbed down movie here - quite the opposite. People who like the movie must have a completely different sense of humor to mine, and I wish I knew how to describe what type of person might enjoy this because I don't want to be singularly negative in my review. Suffice it to say, I don't like a whole lot of comedies, and even though I love to laugh, there are only a handful of movies that can get a rise out of me. If you're easily amused and laugh easily, maybe you could give it a shot.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Anything that makes my granddaughter super happy rates 5 stars... haven't listened to it as this was a birthday gift and Demi isn't exactly in my music genre.
B009LQKHIO|1.0|The editor did a lousy job of editing this book as I found numerous grammatical errors not to mention the fact that I really do not appreciate strong language and explicit sex in a book - that is my main reason for reading Christian Romances.  Love can be explained without graphic explanations of sexual acts.  I found it to be kind of trashy.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Great app.  Got it as a faotd, and I'm glad I did.  This is now my goto alarm clock.  The crescendo alarm is a very nice touch!
B0037B6QSY|4.0|Very calming, but also a bit repetitive. Excellent intro for someone who isn't familiar with meditation. Highly recommended for beginners like me
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Update 12/6/2013<br />I originally gave this game a two-star rating because I was stuck at level 30 and felt there'd be no way to continue without paying for boosts, which are ridiculously expensive for one-time use. However, after persisting for days - maybe after 30 or so attempts, I finally got past it. After that, each level has been challenging but not impossible. I was again stuck for days on level 70, but finally got through it. At certain levels, you have to finish three quests in order to continue and you have to wait 24 hours between each quest. It can be frustratingly difficult at times and a lot depends more on luck rather than skill, but now I know it's not impossible, I enjoy the challenge. I think what makes this game more satisfying than some of the other match-3 games is the animations and sound effects of crushing multiple rows of candy.<br /><br />Original post:<br />I downloaded this game on my Kindle Fire HD because a colleague of mine was playing it on her phone during breaks (she said \\"Candy Crush\\" so I'm assuming it's the same game) and says she's absolutely addicted. I play all sorts of puzzle games, and have enjoyed many of the match-3 games. Compared with some of the other match-3 games I've played, this one is very basic. The graphics are fine and I expect quite appealing to people who love candy but they are not in any way sophisticated and there is no point except to get to higher levels. Even though you earn points as part of the game, earning them is meaningless because you can't use them for anything.<br />The biggest problem is, once you hit a certain level, there doesn't seem to be any way of advancing without spending money to buy boosters - which are not cheap at all. I had fun for a little while but started to get frustrated when I got to levels where if I failed I had to wait or spend money in order to continue playing. Still, I could live with waiting since I have many other games to keep me busy. However, I have not been able to get beyond Level 30 in spite of retrying it at least 20 or 30 times. In this game, you have to drop all the ingredients (cherries and nuts) to the bottom. The lower part of the board is initially filled with the \\"cement\\" tiles that have to be broken before they can be put into play. Even if you manage to smash all the cement tiles and drop the ingredients to the bottom, not all the ingredients are on the board until there are very few moves left. Maybe it's possible to clear this level if you get very lucky, but after trying it so many times I've come to the conclusion there's no way to get beyond this level without spending money on boosters. The price for the boosters (for this particular level) is 99cents for 5 extra move and 3 hammers - which is ridiculously expensive because they would get used up really fast. (You're initially given some boosters when you win some levels to give you an idea of what they do.) I wouldn't spend any money on this game anyway, but a one-time purchase of a dollar or two in order to be able to win boosts within the game might be reasonable.<br />Although I wouldn't call it \\"absolutely awful\\" because the game works as intended, I agree with Gregorio who pointed out that there are so many better games of a similar ilk out there that don't try to force you to spend money. I prefer the games where there's some back story and clearing each level results in achieving some objective, such as Heroes of Kalevala and Azkend2. The graphics are gorgeous in these games. They are paid apps but I downloaded them as the FAOTD. But there are also many free games out there that might ask you to pay for an ad-free version or for boosts to help speed up your progress, but which don't make it altogether impossible to progress.<br /><br />Update 11/03/2013 I FINALLY got past level 30 but I don't know how many times I had to attempt it.to get beyond Level 30 in spite of retrying it at least 20 or 30 times.

B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This game is fun and addicting...I gave it a 5 star review until I played it a couple of days.  All this stuff they want you to buy to play the game is unbelievable.  Then when it told me I had to wait to get more lives to play or buy lives I could not believe what it was saying.<br />I then checked the reviews...if I would have read them before I downloaded the game I would have never put it on my Kindle.<br />The game is a ball to play but there is no way I am going to keep buying things to play the game further.<br />Don't even waste your time downloading this one.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Someone at work mentioned this show recently and got me curious... Little I knew how addicting will be! From the first episode could not wait for the next one to watch and follow this story. I had my bets on who was the bad guy only to be surprise that the one I thought was not! Great story line, wonderful acting and very addicting show!
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|I did not like the the glitzy look and feel of the movie . Just seeems like they overdid the whole thing ,,,in my opinion .
B009P1WES6|5.0|Wow amazing. So many different twists, good insight to French law. Still thinking bout it. Definitely worth a read so get it!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|this game is soooooo fun! ive been waiting to play this FOREVER!!!! can you find the n in m?<br />mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmnmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmwmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a great device. Just about anything that you run under the chrome browser will show up. The set-up is pretty easy - the only thing that tripped me up was that my connection when I plugged in wasn't tight enough. I wish they would let you know in the instructions that the item does emit a light when power is going through it. Also, the instructions are misleading as far as three steps. Make sure you either know or have the password for your wireless router available, or else this is not going to work.<br /><br />Only certain sites are supposedly set-up to run with this, such as Netflix and You Tube. But I found that almost any video that I spun up under Chrome worked fine. So, it is better than advertised. We also have one at work that we use when developing collaboratively. For the price, this simply cannot be beat.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|The game has challenging puzzles and lovely graphics. The puzzles are glitch-free and smooth. Quell is very relaxing to play.
B005UG542S|5.0|Really liked this movie! I think has watched 3 times already and don't think will hesitate on doing it again.
B0060D08JO|3.0|A little bit on the old side of things, but still interesting. I remember the old &#34;TRON&#34;, saw this for the first time. Could be a bit more interesting... technology and movies have sure come a long ways since the original &#34;TRON&#34;.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|It's worth a look, maybe for Mr. Pitt.  But beyond that really farfetched.  They spent more time special effects as opposed to script.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This thing works absolutely great! So why did I give it such a low rating? One word: Support. Or rather, the lack of it!<br /><br />When I bought this dongle, the setup was really easy. You need something with a wireless connection, like a laptop or a phone, in order to set it up, but after that, you can 'cast' to it a number of ways.<br /><br />I plugged mine into my Onkyo receiver's HDMI port. The Onkyo serves as a hub and connects to my TV and speakers. I downloaded the app to my phone and everything connected perfectly to the wireless network in my home.<br /><br />Fast forward a couple of weeks, and all of a sudden, I was losing connection to the Chromecast. I contacted Google's tech support via the phone number provided on the web, and we set about troubleshooting.<br /><br />This is where the story goes bad. We hear so much in the news about how great it is to work at Google. Maybe that's true, but it's murder trying to work WITH Google! I don't know where they recruited these mouthbreathers, but over the course of 5 days, I couldn't get a single straight answer out of them!<br /><br />It turns out all I needed to do was reboot my wireless router to restore connectivity, but that answer eluded 4 different techs. First I was promised a replacement unit. That offer disappeared mysteriously, never to be fulfilled. Next I was told I couldn't cast from a wired connection to my router, such as my PC has. Uh-huh, so how was everything working for 2 weeks before? Then I was told I needed to isolate my wireless connections. Really? Why? No answer; that's just what it says in their script. Finally, I was told the Chromecast HAS to be plugged into an HDMI port on a TV, not an HDMI port on any other device. Uh-huh, like HDMI-in is different from device to device? Nice try.<br /><br />I certainly recommend this little beauty. It works really well, and with such an easy setup, you can send great video to your TV (or media system). For $35, you're not risking much. But if you run into trouble, don't count on the good folks at Google to help you out - they have NF idea what they're doing.ou run into trouble, don't count on the good folks at Google to help you out - they have NF idea what they're doing.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|No surprises, does what it's supposed to. Came with a decent fan, I would suggest beefing that up if you plan on OC'ing or don't have good air flow.
1451666179|5.0|I have been checking back each day for the last three days since I was notified that my copy of this book was indeed on its way toward my home, just to bask in the soft glow of everyone else's love for it. I understand this is a weird thing. But it is the truth. The book itself made me laugh (loudly, in fits) and at times reflect inward. Lost in the Woods maybe one of the funniest stories I have ever read. Ever.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Although graphics and sound were pretty good, the storyline was pretty much not there. I wonder if the background was a video game of some sorts. Was not impressed at all, but yet again might just not be my kind of hing.... Hope others had enjoyed it....
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It had a good story line and the characters were easy to identify with. Good book.
B00EC6VA98|5.0|Obel's writing style and voice are very soothing and enjoyable.  I bought her first CD and I could hardly wait for more.  I was not disappointed with this new CD.  It is a great CD for relaxing.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Lots of great special effects and action.  If Hollywood can spend tens of millions of dollars to create a spectacle, why can't they spend at least a little of that on a good writer. It completely loses credibility with Mankind creating huge robots to ineffectually slug it out with huge monsters.  Really? This is the best we can do?  What happened to hellfire missles?  Even a WWII howitzer would more damage to the monsters than these kung fu robots seem to do.  Most of the time, they would pick up a monster and heave it a quarter mile to land in the ocean.  Mind you, the special effects are awesome, but (on a smaller scale), I used to do that to my daughter and she loved it.  The monsters did too and kept coming back for more.  I gave up half-way through.  What a waste of millions of dollars.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app does exactly what a four function calculator should. I have had no problems. It helps me pay my bills every month.
B0000041XX|5.0|It is awesome, a masterpiece performance.  This replaces my VHS recording which I had for many years. I am happy to have these guys back in my life.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Great movie! As close and good will ever get to the original show and much better than the first movie.
B00DL2W7Q4|2.0|The book ends suddenly without a concluding chapter. The initial premise is not satisfactorily closed out.<br />Disappointing addition to other great books by Gladwell.
B001BRAUYM|4.0|love This Vin Diesel saga  love the sci fi thriller keeps you the edge thru entire movie would rent again
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this is a 3D fun and cool experience. i recommend this game. ive had this game  for a while and it was fun but the update made it better. A whole lot better
006202406X|1.0|I really feel empty after reading this third book. Even if everything was unrealistic I began to feel hope for the humanity.<br /><br />Spoilers!!<br /><br />The relationships of Tris and Tobias have changes, they've deepened. It was beautiful. But then everything was broken. I don't see why do we need to face her death. It is why we chose to read this kind of books. I think it is not the best idea to show us the cruel reality, we've already seen it!! It was a terrible ending.... I wish I've stopped at the second book:( I usually don't just read the book, I live it. And these issues are not what I actually want to live when I choose a book.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Fascinating that a girl so young could be so brave and well-spoken.  She is truly a role  model for everyone.  Well written and informative.  She is so inspiring.
B00E8B1358|2.0|Entertaining but nothing great. I wish didn't pay for it, but I'm glad didn't waste my money at the theater.
B00006JSS8|5.0|If you are a Stevie Wonder fan, and do not have his individual albums, this is a must buy, as it has almost all of his hits through the years.
B00571F26Y|4.0|My hubby is glueten intolerant and I read this book to be supportive.  It was very informative.  I was glad I read it.
B008JFUNHI|3.0|Some of the dialogue also struck me as a bit tone-deaf or flat.<br /><br />And is it my imagination, or was this film missing an entire first act from the book?  I remember amazing conversations between the two siblings and a whole thing about internet forums.  Resultantly, I didn't get the sense of vulnerability or humanity of Ender in the beginning, or just how intelligent he and his sister really were.  There's far too much reiteration of simply how Ender is their savior, or perfect, or some other \\"established\\" nonsense.  Get's old.<br /><br />The film could have either been another half hour longer or been very long and split into two films.  The person I was with who'd never read the book was also completely lost for most of the film.<br /><br />Oh, and they made it into micro gravity velocity within, what, 20 seconds?  More B.S. orbital mechanics in Hollywood films, I guess.  Not even Gravity could escape that problem (pun unintended, but awesome nonetheless).<br /><br />Still probably worth seeing for fans of the book, but I'd recommend a matin&eacute;e showing or waiting for streaming or disk.<br /><br />And avoid the pointless 2k IMAX version.  That's correct: just a 2K 24fps interpositive and no 3D.<br /><br />3D and additional length would have helped the film, in spite of the sometimes bland delivery.  A much longer, less-tight director's cut, with stereoscopic 48fps (no problem for the CGI) for some later digital copy release would be welcome.  Heck, make it 3D 60fps 1080p for a digital copy release (all 3D capable computers & NVidia-3D monitors can handle it), and I'd pay to see that.
B00000G3I2|5.0|I relate to the story, because of my age.  The acting was great, along with the music that brought you right to the era.  Good story telling.
B000J233SK|5.0|I LOVE this album, this is the second copy I have bought, it's 'different' sort of a fusion between some historic music styles and modern, a blend that works very well indeed.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Overall the movie was pretty much entertaining, but wasn't very impressed by it. I felt it was a bit rushed and could have used a little more explanation at far as how the 4 magicians got involved into the plot. The development of the final plot was great and pretty much my favorite part. The end was surprising but yet, I think some of the details could have been revealed earlier to create a more suspenful effect. Big fun of the crew!
B005LAIIN0|5.0|A nonstop thriller from the very beginning all the way to the very end!  Enjoyed all the main characters performances.
0316069884|5.0|Before I ever picked up this book, I had heard enough about it to know that it is life changing. After reading it, I know this to be true. I had been dabbling with vegetarianism before I read it. I had watched some of the documentaries on netflix, like hungry for change, but nothing affected me like this book did. Well researched, well written and compassionate. Foer writes in a thought provoking manner, that can't help but make you want to change your lifestyle. My husband is now terrified that I will try to get him to go vegetarian and you know what? After reading this book I will. Get it and be ready to cry and be so angry you want to explode. The truth is out there if you're prepared to open your eyes.
B00003CX9E|5.0|A fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry, and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in, and on it there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on. She was carrying a white parasol. I only saw her for one second. She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl. ~ Mr. Bernstein<br /><br />That seems to be what it is all about. The wisp of the moment remains.

B0021L9MJG|5.0|One of the all time great Horror Movies. Still holds its own to this day.I was impressed,Excellent Picture & Sound for its age. Highly Recommended!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Great concept, but lack of support! I was excited to purchase 2! I was hoping to see the next media center, a gtv replacement. But clearly this is not it. The lack of support, no real updates just killed it for me. Sure it has netflix, but i'm not in a need of an netflix player. Play from your browser or phone is cool but nothing an $20 more expensive Roku device can't handle. If you are looking for a media player & smart TV features this is not the product. I feel like this product regardless the great start and demand is just the next NexusQ.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Absolutely loved every word of it. This is the Grisham I know and love! Reminds me of his earlier works, but this one is a notch up.

0767827902|5.0|There is coming of age, remembrance and regret in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW. The year is 1951. The place is the dying town of Anarene, Texas. What hits you first in this film? For me it was the images. There are black-and-white images of rural Texas, rundown buildings and cars. We are definitely in a Western setting but also it is definitely contemporary for the decade of the 1950s. One way of life is dying and perhaps transitioning into a new one. The visual imagery is vividly captured by cinematographer Robert Surtees's always intuitive and brilliant work. One way of life, that of living a moral lifestyle through hard or mundane work, gives way to cynical, lethargic, indifferent and bleak modernism. The film focuses on the two friends, Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges, as they transition from boyhood into manhood. There is Ben Johnson who plays Sam the Lion, who owns the diner, the pool hall, and the Royal theater. These are the only attractions in the dying town of Anarene. Ben Johnson's Sam the Lion is all that is left of a younger man's dreams and aspirations as he looks back and reminisces with Timothy Bottoms at an isolated pond somewhere outside of town on the prairie offering him a hand rolled cigarette. There is a lot of time in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW. That seems that is all that remains in that dying town and there is enough time to remember and think of what once was and what will become of that existence. I love this film.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Would rate it 5 stars but it crashes a little more than it should.  But I never lose the progress I've made.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have to admit that when I first heard of this series I was kind of unsure about it. But after reading the first two books, I can now see what all the fuss was about.  The story just keeps getting better and better. Can't wait to read the next one.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|I mean, come on, isn't it obvious why I would give this 5 stars? A blue-ray copy an entire season of Doctor Who. With each episode lasting almost an entire hour, and 13 episodes in the set (not to mention all the special extra features), this is great for a marathon on a sick day, or just watching 1 or 2 episodes everyday and having enough material to last you for a while. As for the actual episodes themselves, to each their own, my tastes might not necessarily be someone else's too, so I wont go too much into that. But this introduced Matt Smith, and I believe him to be an AMAZING Doctor. It also introduced Rory and Amy (the Doctor's parents-in-law, so that's special already) and they develop and blossom into amazing companions.<br />This also contains, what I believe to be, the most touching and wonderfully written episode of the Doctor Who universe, Vincent and the Doctor. I have watched and rewatched this episode NUMEROUS times, but still cannot finish that episode without crying, and I have no shame in admitting that as a 23 year old male.  There's also plenty of Daleks and Weeping Angels along with other favorite antagonists of the series.<br />All in all, I'd highly recommend it for any Whovian, or anyone attempting to get into Doctor Who even.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|An interesting point of view around how to succeed in adverse situations.  Questions traditionally accepted advantages and presents facts around success rates in underdog situations.  about a dozen examples from different segments of society (education, civil rights, crime, dyslexia, medical breakthroughs, business success and various other situations like growing up without a parent) where your initial intuition/common sense may be questioned when results support the opposite of what you believe may happen.  Gladwell does a good job of presenting facts supporting his hypothesis that the underdog more often than not may have the real advantage.  Not as good as Outliers (great book everyone should read), but a pretty good read for anyone who is about to send a kid off to college (you may change your opinion about where to send them).  Also presents situations where the greatest of adversity (learning disabilities, growing up parentless) have provided the type of fortitude for people to push to accomplish great things that most would not have had the courage to approach (specifically addressed in his chapter re: Dr. Freirich's developing treatment for childhood leukemia).  Worth the read.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|While not necessarily scary, except for the scene with the baseball boy, I loved this book because of the great characters and the even greater talent of Stephen King.  Dr. Sleep is a sequel to The Shinning, one of the most frightening books I've ever read, but this book doesn't seem to be trying to frighten the reader.  There are some scary parts, but more subtle than outright frightening.<br /><br />What Dr. Sleep is thought, is a wonderful book that I found hard to put down.  We meet the young boy, Dan, who was terrorized by his father at the Outlook Hotel, now 36 years later.  Dan would probably be diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress syndrome if such a diagnosis had been around at the time.  Seeing your father go mad is not something that sets you up for any kind of normal life.<br /><br />Dan now is an alcoholic, just like his dad was, who wanders from job to job until he finally hits bottom.  Finding himself in New Hampshire and among new friends, Dan is able to quit drinking with the help of AA, and start a new life.  If only things were that simple.<br /><br />Dr. Sleep finds Stephen King keeping up with modern life.  Dan's abilities are called the 'shining' a word King coined that we'd recognized today as a 'sixth sense'.  Dan connects with a young girl with the same abilities while he goes about his work as a Hospice working, easing the dying on the road to the next world.<br /><br />Aba, the young girl with even great 'shining' than Dan, has been sensed by some soul-sucking human parasites who want her 'shining' to feed their lifestyles.  Dan has to relive all of his own fears to save Aba from seemingly ordinary creatures who pass for elderly diesel--pushing citizens of the road, enjoying their twilight years.<br /><br />I found Dan Torrance to be one of the most flawed, compassionate and compelling characters I've ever had the pleasure of meeting between the pages of a book.  He used the nearly overwhelming fear of his youth to build of life helping others through their greatest fear, stepping unto the great beyond.  A true wounded hero for the modern world, Dan Torrance has become an admirable man, something he could never see.<br /><br />Dr. Sleep isn't as long as some of King's books, though at 500+ pages, it is long, though it never felt too long.  I found myself anxious to get back to Dan Torrance's world to find out what would happen, but in the end, maybe it was just to spend more time with such a wonderful character.<br /><br />Stephen King has written over 50 books, and over a long span of time, yet I never have felt for a minute that he was every 'phoning it in'.  The man clearly loves his work and always works hard at giving the reader every ounce of his talent in every book of his I've ever read, which might not be all of them, but it is the majority.<br /><br />King never wastes his talent and I'm happy that even though I'm sure he doesn't have to ever work, that he keeps at his typewriter, giving pleasure to his millions of fans.ers through their greatest fear, stepping unto the great beyond.

B00E4A830G|5.0|We have read the whole Harry Bosch series now and every one of them was  a cracker, wonderful series. Hope there are one or two more.
006202406X|3.0|I read the book before checking out the reviews.  Probably good to do the same to get your own perspective on things.<br /><br />This book is written in Tris and Four's P.O.V, different from the other two books. At times it was not clear who was talking.  It helps to pay attention when the other character's name is mentioned and the particular event associated with the character.<br /><br />Compared to the other two books, this one appeared to be more explanatory and drawn-out after the characters pass the fence.<br />//<br />/<br />/<br />/<br />/<br />/<br />//<br />One of the strongest scenes for me, other than what happened to Tris, is what happened to Uriah and Four's involvement.<br /><br />I also wanted to know more about Edith Prior.  Tris and Caleb talked about her, but there is the lingering question in my mind why she chose to forget herself.  Yes, she was one of the original creators of the experiment, but the result of the Purity War must have had a big impact to sacrifice her memories and involve her future family.<br /><br />Also, if the explanation from David wasn't so monotone and if the author described the Purity War in a more descriptive way somehow, with more pressing importance while tying in Edith, not just saying that she embellished the situation in her video.  Which then brings the same question why was it so important for Edith to sacrifice herself?<br /><br />On another note...<br /><br />The Divergent series started with Tris not knowing who she was to its ending with Tris' self sacrifice, as she realizes she's more abnegation than when the series started.  I'm sorry, but I think Natalie was selfish in taking her.  Tris was only starting to realize who she was as a person and then she dies.  Ugh.<br /><br />In addition, Four's perspective towards the end after Tris' death! *sigh*<br /><br />There are other not so feel good moments -<br />-  Uriah depressed after Marlene and Lynn dies, and he dies too.<br />-  Peter realizes he's messed up (surprising right?), but off course the memory serum doesn't completely work.<br />-  The bad lives on, i.e. Marcus and David, with no serious repercussions.<br />The reality bites.<br /><br />The characters have experienced so much, with such chaos, one after the other throughout the course of this trilogy...it's been an emotional roller coaster for me as a reader as well. This might also be why I'm having an issue with Tris dying.  There was no sense of relief even though the Divergent conflict was resolved.  Hoping the author agrees to make two endings for this movie. She appears to be sincere in her message of being brave through tough times and people needing one another to heal but this last book left a sour note, where the author's message, I think, could have been illustrated in another way while encouraging her readers with a more positive imprint.  I also think that the faction values could've been tied together somehow in the ending...but doesn't seem to work with Four's perspective right?<br /><br />I'll just let this book settle and maybe in time, I'll come to accept it.<br /><br />The journey is over. I appreciate the story however bleak it came out to be.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|It was a good movie some good part and some ok parts. Had some really funny overall I could watch it again
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Excellent book, well written, informative. Everyday just have to read a section out load to my wife.<br />Just fascinating and fun.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|The Beach Boys did a series of albums in the later 1960's/early 1970's marked them out as having moved far beyond the sun/surf/cars/girls band that most people conceived them to be. Any Beach Boys fan worthy of the name needs all these albums, and probably already has them: Pet Sounds, Sunflower, Surf's Up, and the much-delayed SMiLE (sic), available in different incarnations.<br /><br />\\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" is none of these. Nor, however, is it a complete throwback to their early bubblegum days. The best way I can describe this album is that it's what I would have expected a transition album, made just before their Pet Sounds period, might have sounded like. These are straight songs; there is nothing like the bizarre experimentation on songs like \\"Cool Cool Water\\" and \\"Surf's Up\\". They are however evocative of the best of the Beachies' \\"pop\\" period; songs like \\"California Girls\\", \\"In My Room\\" and \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" would not sound at all out of place here. Given that Brian seems to be once again estranged from Mike Love, This is probably the last real beach Boys album we will get, and it is a surprisingly good return to form from a band that has released its share of clunkers over the years. Even the voices still sound young and fresh. How do they manage to do it? (Yeah, I know... they've had 60 years of practice.)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cool game great graphics.  In app  purchasing always sucks but you get quite a bit of play time before you have to wait or pay.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|*plot spoiler* I read books because they are a way of escaping the harsh reality and brutality of this world. In a book I can shut it all out for a short time. I do not choose books with depressing subject matter or about real world problems. I loved the first two books in this series. They were powerful and unique, a new world to explore on every page. However, I never would have read ANY of the series if I had known that Roth would kill off the main character. I hate it when authors, for whatever reason, be it shock factor or a desire to have power over the reader, decide that death is the only solution. So trite. If I wanted to have my heart ripped out, there is always Romeo and Juliet, a far more lasting and powerful work truth be told. Thanks for making me want to throw my kindle across the room. I will never buy another one of her books.
1401938906|4.0|I need to re-read it and work through the experiments again.  I expect to have success in all of them and I haven't as yet. I'm sure this is to do with me and not the book!

B001AQO3QA|5.0|.<br />We all know the movies already, my review pertains to this particular amazing box set release. It is really, really well done.<br /><br />The packaging is very cool. They managed to make it small and compact yet elegant and smart looking. To accomplish this, each one of the six discs is not in its own enclosed case. Instead, each individual disc is tucked into a sleeve that sits on top of a very thick (very, like 3-5 millimeters) cardboard page. Some may object to each disc not having its own box, but I think it's done well plus I am always very careful handling discs. This \\"book\\" then slides into an outer protective box.<br /><br />As far as the disc content goes, the best way to describe this is- comprehensive and definitive. For each film you can choose between the original theatrical release or the directors cut (if there was one). I know that the first film, Alien, received a new 4K transfer. Not sure if this goes for the others. All four films are pristine transfers and look stunning. Lossless DTS-HD Master 5.1 audio is available on all films.<br /><br />I scoured the bonus material and as far as I can tell (and also what I've read), there is simply no supplemental material that has ever been available to the home theater market that is not in this box set. It has everything and I mean going way back to the laser disc releases. Speaking of which, I thought it was kind of neat to look at some of those old laser disc supplements and take a look at the technology and to see the look of the format.<br /><br />Many moons ago I paid $90 for this (that's right, NINETY bucks! - and it's worth it). It's now selling for far below that. So if you are a fan of any (or all) of these films, this is a wonderful anthology box set to own.
0143038419|2.0|I liked the book. I have nothing bad to say about the author but I was jealous the whole time reading Eat, Pray, Love. Elizabeth Gilbert picked a profession that allowed her to take a year and write this book. Who can blame her? Also she was paid a couple hundred grand to cover her expenses. Who wouldn't pass that up? Now here's my problem. I go through the same panic attacks as the author does in this book, but I have bills to pay and can't afford a year off to \\"find myself\\".<br /><br />Elizabeth is getting a divorce from her husband and we don't know why. We find out she's not happy but I was a little annoyed how she wouldn't let us in on the details of what drove her to this point. Felt like she was leaving out a very big detail about why her marriage failed especially how she is willing to give up everything in the divorce. Makes her look like a saint to the readers but she is hiding something that we are not privileged of knowing and it was the only thing I kept thinking about during the whole read. She finally gets divorced and loses everything but gets an advance on this book so she's not living on the street. Everything works out like this in Eat, Pray, Love. I give her credit that she tries to create some conflict but there just isn't any. I was annoyed with her giving up sex but being tempted at the same time. She does something selfless and gets all her friends to donate money to her Balinese friend so she can buy a home. Very nice of her to do but still came off as self centered. She hates doing a chant but gets over it. Would she have gotten over it if she wasn't writing this book? I'm saying no. This is what bothered me about Eat, Pray, Love. I would have much rather read about someone taking a trip to Italy, India, and Indonesia to find themselves if I knew that they didn't know they were going to write about it. I felt like she always had that \\"what will be good for the book\\" thought process during her journey.<br /><br />I'm done complaining. I'll admit this is a bad review based off jealousy. Elizabeth Gilbert is a good writer and I may read her other works.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Really like this game.  Has lots of levels with very challenging puzzles as you advance.  Can work at this for hours.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game is fun but not necessarily the least frustrating. I feel that some of the  requirement for certain quests is kind of ridiculous. But still fun for time killing.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Twilight meets a slightly erotic novel.  Unimaginative and poorly written, I am surprised that there is so much hype around this book.
B00ARHAAZ6|1.0|I was once again fooled by the intro paragraph. What a total waste of 7.98.<br /><br />If you are a 7th grader and don't really care about plausibility, then, sure, go ahead and read this book.<br /><br />If you are looking for something well written for an adult audience, give this one a pass. I wonder if this was even written by a human being, something about it makes me think it could have been computer generated. I don't know.... Like in the movie Blade Runner when he found out that the woman was a replicant with the statement &#34; the entree was boiled dog&#34;. Parts of this book remind me of that......<br />I'm not going to finish it, I think it sucks.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2 so much. All my cousins play this game.The good thing about this game is that Imangi studios has lots of games like temple run 2.
006202406X|1.0|So many people have said that they didn't give the book a poor rating because of its ending. I'm not sure why that needs to be clarified - the ending is horrible and it completely spoils the entire series for me. The 1 rating is ALL about the ending because, as a result, I now regret wasting my time reading the whole thing - especially rereading the first two books in anticipation of this one.
B0089OBLDO|5.0|Works flawlessly. All buttons/triggers and analog sticks work as they should. Turbo option is a nice bonus for those in to that sort of thing.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|It's free so what do you have to lose. As with the other talking animals it's great for my 5 year old granddaughter to play with on my Kindle for about 5 minutes, then she is done. You can buy extras to add to it, but I never have.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Just wanted to get this to test it.  I understand its early on and  that maybe new developments and partnerships will help improve it.  As for now, its really good if you don't have a smart tv and have a smart phone.  Limited streaming to Netflix, You Tube and a Google browser(that is if you get the desktop app and have a wifi enabled laptop or computer).

B005LAIIN0|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book this is based on a while back and was excited to learn a movie was being made of it, unfortunately this isn't a good film of the book, but it is a decent zombie film. The story follows a familiar pattern for this type of film, there's an outbreak that spreads rapidly and humanity is turned into zombies.<br /><br />What this film does better than most is drive home the possible worldwide scenario for this story. It showcases some incredible set pieces on a large scale for a zombie outbreak. In fact this is the film's strongest point, some of those scenes are simply fantastic to watch.<br /><br />The pacing of the film is pretty good, it gets going quickly and keeps the pace up throughout, although there's a minor stutter near the end. The story might not be anything that hasn't been seen before, but the telling of it is slick.<br /><br />Brad Pitt does a good job as the lead, it's far from his greatest role but he works well as the focus of the film. The book is more a collection of tales from around the world telling the history of the outbreak, the film follows a similar globe trotting pattern, but in a more singular fashion, just following the single lead character.<br /><br />Overall this is a fun zombie film, it's sense of scale and high production values sets it up a strong member of a crowded genre, but is well worth a watch.
