0385504225|4.0|I JUST FINISHED THE BOOK YESTERDAY AND IT WAS OK...A BIT TOO PREDICTABLE, BUT GOOD...I THINK IT WOULD MAKE FOR A GREAT TV MOVIE, BUT DEFINATELY NOT A BIG SCREEN MOVIE THOUGH...    DAN BROWNS OTHER BOOKS I FELT WERE BETTER.
B0028QDXJ4|3.0|Fine the Concert was good,but the HD transfer is not that great.There is lot of grains seen in most of the songs.Yes but the audio quality is good.    Ryan Vaz.
B002GY9F9K|1.0|First off I have read the entire series (starting from the original short story) this series is 'based' on and I would feel completely insulted if Terry Goodkind was endorsing this show. It is understood that not everything can translate from novel to television or even movie but regardless there are some things that are a complete disgrace to the series.  For instance, there are no 'Seeker Rules', the rules that Zedd keeps spouting off are a twisted reference to the 'Wizard Rules' which are a crucial part of the entire series.  Secondly Richard never recieves training from Zedd about being the Seeker, anyone who was read even one book knows that you cannot train a true Seeker, they find thier own path. Everyone else along for the ride is merely that, along for the ride, merely used as the Seekers sounding board.  Third the characterization, let alone the acting, is horrible beyond even fun B type movies. The guy playing Richard has virutally nothing of the character in him, let alone Kahlan or Zedd. Plus where are the mannerisms that make the characters who they are, I do not recall Zedd spouting out one 'Zounds'. The worse disaster in the characterization had to be Adie (mind you I have not read the novels in about 2 years) but I always pictured her as a black lady from the book discreptions. The actress on top of that was horrible considering how much of a pivotal side character Adie is, and doesn't even hint on her she copes with her blindness through her magic, instead of feeling around like the actress does.  And what about Chase and the Wardens??? That was handled horribly too, which annoys me because Chase was a good character.   And where is the history???? Darken Rahl not having burns on half his body? Where are the Mord Sith another group of pivotal characters??? Richard's mom may or may not be alive??? And seriously the breaking of the border like that?? It was a key bonding point between Richard and Kahlan as well as where Richard discovered the actualcost of using the Sword of Truth which is like some retarded power up now in a video game. Confessors being raised by the Sisters of the Light as well as people being freed from thier touch if they die?????  This show is horrible, the only things actually being used from the novels are the names. It would not surprise me if the people wasting thier time making this series decide to make Stephen King's novels into a group of children's television show. Everything from the acting, swordplay to special effects reeks of some freshman in high school's attempt at making a television show while blatantly stealing someone else's concept and warping it into a rated G televsion show.
B000A2RRF4|4.0|This is one of the best MJ live concert everseen performing.The AV quality is good  but not so great.Hope the same concert should come on the Bluray...with best HD transfer i hope so.....      It may take decades to have a great person like this MJJJJJ.    Ryan Vaz.
0385504225|3.0|I agree with most of the 1-3 star reviews, but wanted to add this:  The ending is so unbelievable in that Peter Solomon, after everything he'd been through seems way too lucid.  His turn-around is so fake.  Not to spoil, but to all those who have read the book, think of all that Peter Solomon had gone through and then think of his actions in the end.  Way too upbeat if you ask me.

0307269981|3.0|The second installment in Larsson's \\"Girl\\" trilogy, PLAYED W FIRE is an adequate sequel and a strong novel, if not the tour-de-force that DRAGON TATTOO was.<br /><br />Larsson's skills are again on display, the mystery is organic. Especially where he is working in the context of estalished characters, it doesn't feel as cooked and melodramatic as mysteries - especially franchises - often can.<br /><br />Still, where watching Blomqvist set up housekeeping in the Arctic village in DRAGON was both a compelling introduction to the central cast and a driver of plot points crucial to the story, Larsson's dalliances with Salander as she splits time in the Carribean between ruminating on life and hatching a vigilante revenge killing feel philosophical and more forced.<br /><br />Larsson also uses a crutch to get him through the restrictions imposed by carrying on with these characters. Salander is the same \\"girl,\\" but - in many ways - not the same character. He telegraphs that. She has undergone a physical transformation.<br /><br />And, her self-flagellation (both in a quasi-paedophiliac sexual tryst and in a bout of comodification as she sets up her Swedish home upon return) offers a very different perspective on the withdrawn and spartan character he established in the first book.<br /><br />Larsson has the knack to make the work feel like something more than a murder mystery, but he still plays with all the stock parts: murderous criminal motorcycle gangs, a reporter who \\"knows too much,\\" the mysterious afflicted Eastern European villain, and a superhuman henchman straight from Fleming.<br /><br />I suppose it was not technically written as a sequel, and it isn't bad in the end, but it begs the question: does a sequel need to be written unless it ABSOLUTELY NEEDS to be written?<br /><br />Lastly, for me Larsson nearly showed astonishing artistic integrity and storytelling cunning with a late plot twist as he unwinds the mystery. I was not expecting it and would not have even called for it. But, the way he back off of it was cheap and brought this down into the three range.cheap and brought this down into the three range.
B0017VG66I|5.0|If you are a western buff, these are must have movies to add to your collection. Perfect sound and picture quality.
0061730327|3.0|I agree with most of what comprises the 5-star reviews of this book. Uplifting, inspirational, compelling and amazing without a doubt. Unfortunately, the harnessing doesn't really begin in earnest until midway through, and the first half includes a lot of personal and local history that is just too unrelated to the story's heart for readers who are looking at this as the story of how one African villager grabbed a hold of his home country's natural resources to improve life for his people and himself.    The developed/developing world conflict on climate change has been playing out more publicly as energy and environmental politics have taken on a larger presence both in the Obama presidency and in world politics (especially as the UN Copenhagen climate conference approaches).     US energy legislation is floundering right alongside health care. Developing countries - China and India are the countries most commonly pointed to in media reports - are reluctant to slow the growth of their economies by putting the brakes on energy capacity growth -- even if it is dirty. What concessions they are likely to make, they want developed countries to pay for. THE BOY WHO HARNESSED THE WIND has the potetial to be a gripping example of how the clean energy future could be both transformative and empowering in a way that levels the playing field worldwide. Imagine: a world where more people could enjoy the quality of life that is afforded to wealthy Western nations - thanks in part to their ability to consume more energy - without proliferation of the harmful environmental impacts that are being borne across the world and often by those who are not the consumers.    While everyone seems to expect the rich European countries to lead the way to a new energy model, this book underscores why the developing world holds the most promise. The developing world is a great laboratory for innovation and experimentation on renewable energy. The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind is one story of thepromise that such innovations hold for those nations, and the potential they hold for the world. But, a lot of early stuff on local lore and childhood meanderings makes this more Angela's Ashes than Silent Spring.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|Alice in Chains \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" is easily THE hard rock album of this otherwise dismal and dissapointing musical decade.<br /><br />However, I haven't heard any of these tracks on NYC's so-called major rock station.<br /><br />Of course, commercial rock radio will overlook this masterpiece album like they always do because, well, they can't interrupt their heavy rotation of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\"....no, somebody living under a rock somewhere might not have heard these songs so they remain on once an hour rotation, therefore Alice In Chains (among other great new music) might get a spin at the 3:00am time slot.<br /><br />Otherwise commercial rock radio will play \\"Man In The Box\\" at least 4 million times a year because, well, you know, that's Alice in Chains, like, only song, isn't it?<br /><br />The guitars and the vocals on BGWTB are simply sensational, organic, cohesive, and classic and the drums and bass are totally fat, rounding out the heavy sound. The rythyms are great, nice continuity throughout the record. The songs have great hooks, strong songwriting.<br /><br />What a triumphant return for Alice in Chains!!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I discovered Dan Brown long before The Da Vinci Code became the enormous hit that it became. I've read everything he's put out, & I think his best has been Angels & Demons. That said, The Lost Symbol is simply a weak story with a lame ending that a novice can see coming from a mile away. In many ways, I feel Dan Brown is a victim of his own success...The Da Vinci Code hits huge & there become a bunch of copy cats, to include the National Treasure film. My biggest problem with this book came when I realized it felt like I was watching [[ASIN:B001992NWO Bones: The Complete Third Season]], which involves murder, a secret society, & the grid the city was built on. Even one of the lines in the book and Bones are exactly the same, which took me out of the book entirely.<br /><br />Even though this is not Dan Brown's sophomore book, it feels like it is. This is a difficult genre to reinvent every time he writes, so I imagine the stories will continue to go downhill. I would advise to skip this book. If you need a Dan Brown fix, read [[ASIN:B002CF0GP0 Angels and Demons (Robert Langdon's First Adventure)]] . In my opinion, this is the only book that actually has a surprise & thrilling ending.
0307388921|4.0|but it's the first the comes to mind.     Really enjoyed this book. Anyone under 30 will also love it too.

0684833395|4.0|I don't remember how i came across catch-22 but i'm glad i did.     It was difficult for me to stay on track during the first few chapters (there are waaaay too many characters) but i really started to enjoy it afterwords. Some parts made me really laugh out loud and others made my jaw drop in realizing the horrors of war.     Highly recommended!
B002LIKMB6|5.0|Shakira has made a very fun and upbeat album. I really like it because of the beats. My favorite song is Men in this Town.
B001FB4W02|5.0|So far the best season ever with high definition picture and sound quality. The series are getting better by episodes. Lots of extras in Blu-ray version and I can't wait for season 9!!!!!
B001FB55I0|5.0|This movie was really good.  Confused how so many did not give it a good rating on Yahoo and other sites.  I am impressed.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I've never followed alt rock so I was pretty much unfamiliar with most of the artists on this soundtrack other than Linkin Park (heard of, but never listened to).  I've found I really enjoy most of these songs. I'm not fond of either Paramour song - the melodies are fine, but I just find the singer's voice annoying.  I also tend to skip the Perry Farrell song \\"Go All The Way\\"; it's ok, but there's nothing compelling about it.    I think the rest of the soundtrack is wonderful, however.  I've heard \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\" is a bit of a departure for Linkin Park, and if this is true I'm not sure how I'd like their other stuff.  But this particular song is great. \\"Full Moon,\\" \\"Spotlight,\\" \\"Tremble For My Beloved\\" and \\"Eyes On Fire\\" are great to hear in their entirety - in the movie the last two are given very short shrift.  My two absolute favorites, though, are \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" and \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth.\\"  I downloaded these songs as singles long before purchasing the whole album, and have since purchased all of Muse's albums (haven't done that with Iron & Wine, though).    Unlike some reviewers, I neither absolutely love nor absolutely hate Rob Pattinson's song \\"Never Think\\".  I just really like it.  I can't understand most of what he is singing (very much like Bob Dylan), but I actually find his voice kind of soothing and the guitar work is wonderful. And, as others have noted, \\"Bella's Lullaby\\" is a lovely melody but just isn't a lullaby...it's not soothing enough as each note is very distinctly enunciated by the piano.  I did end up getting Carter Burwell's movie score before buying this soundtrack, so I was already very familiar with this track (I recommend the score, as well).    All in all, I've been VERY happy with this purchase and am looking forward to both the score and soundtrack for New Moon.
0451219597|5.0|The greatest heroine character I ever read in this genre. While the story may be inplausible in parts, if you like WW2 suspense with a superb heroine you'll love this book. She's the type of character that you can't help but love whcih makes every scene she is in so much fun. Two other books I recommend in this genre are Mr Follett's \\"The Key to Rebecca\\" and Greg Iles - \\"Black Cross.\\" Enjoy.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I've come to expect a lot from Dan Brown, and this one definitely did not deliver.  When I reached the end, I felt as though I'd gone there for no particular reason.  It was pointless and disappointing.  Robert Langdon deserved a better story.
0307454541|3.0|What a tedious book! The author keeps getting bogged down in infinitesimal details that made me, on more than one occasion, want to put this away and say \\"forget it\\". I could get past that Sweden is a liberal, socialistic society if only Larson would stop reminding me. And he does this in each and every chapter. Domestic violence is a problem in Sweden but after two or three reminders, I've got it already. The book really drug on through the first half and only when the story itself took over did it seem worthwhile. And the story is a good one. I gave it 3 stars because of the plot and how it unfolds. I just didn't need all the other extra stuff, over & over, to enjoy this tale. Makes me wonder if he really wanted to write a book of fiction or a study on modern Swedish society. One thing for sure, I won't be booking a trip to Stockholm real soon. And forget IKEA and Swedish meatballs.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I was so excited to see that Disney was releasing the one that started it all...<br /><br />Disney's first \\"Platinum Edition\\" DVD is a terrific 2-disc set that every DVD fan should keep for all eternity. The Colors look splendid. The sound is clean and without a scratch, although some dialogs lack detail. The 5.1 audio remix provides mildly effective separation and bass for the background music. Otherwise, it is neither better nor worse than the included original mono soundtrack.I love that they added the side screens to make it a wide screen version.<br /><br />What can I say besides I love,love, love it!!!!

0439023483|5.0|The hunger games is about a 16 year old girl named katniss everdeen. She lives in the far future, where america was destroyed and a new country named Panem sprung up from the ashes. The diabolical capitol is rich and well fed, while the other disticts starve. The capitol rules by ravaging fear amoung the districts to make them obey. So that they obey twice as well, the make them send children to fight to the deaths in a massive arena. This is called the Hunger Games. When Katniss's sister is picked for the games, she bravly volunteers to go in her place. Now she must defeat sinister opponets who have trained her whole life for this if she hopes to come out alive. It was a great book, combining technology, science fiction, horror, love, and rebellion in an apocalyptic future. One of the parts I didn't like was when the evil competetor Cato was killed by the werewolves, and although they made it feel real, I am just not a fan of teenagers getting chewed up by mutant werewolves. One of the stongest scenes was when Rue died, they made that scene really powerful. I also like the idea of how the Capitol thinks that if they can dehumanize all of the districts, that they can control them easier. I don't think that would work, because If you can think like a man, yet fight like an animal then you would be two times as dangerous an opponet. I think Suzanne Collins made a bold decision when she made the book from 1st person perspective, because it supplies many strength and weaknesses. A strentgh is that then you can feel like you are fighting in the games, and another is that then you can really get to know katniss better. Some weaknesses are that then you can't get to know the other charactors as well, and that then anything that katniss doesn't know, you don't either. All in all it was a book full of suspence,thrill, and villany, a must read book.
1572816112|5.0|I absolutely love this deck. The drawings are beautiful and just seem so imaginative. They really speak to me. Best deck I ever bought.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I really, really wanted to write this one off. Especially after TTL, which for a long time I thought was a total disaster - and still think is a triple bogey at best. But sure enough, I found myself at 9:03 P.M California time downloading CITH off iTunes within the first three minutes of its release.<br /><br />My first impression? So warm, so comforting, so nostalgic. And not just in a \\"it's getting to be late Fall, so let's get in the mood for Christmas\\" way. No, in a pure Americana kind of way. This is a Rockwell painting come to life, it is not some kind of ironic commentary on the past... it is a memorial to the past. Dylan does this perfectly. It baffles me, but I really think this will turn out to be one of his most memorable records.<br /><br />Let me venture to say that this is also a vocal masterpiece. Forget those low-quality clips on amazon.com.. when you hear this the way Bob Frost intended it, you will curse yourself for ever cursing it.<br /><br />And surprisingly, there are no real low points. It is just raw and perfect from \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" to \\"Little Town of Bethlehem.\\" It makes you think of a bright, white, hopeful day. Logs on the fire, ancestors passed on, old dusty pictures that were never digitized. This feels like something old that turned up in a cross-country move. A brilliant, sharp, autumn feeling like those old first days of school.<br /><br />\\"Amen.\\"
B0029LHW4U|3.0|Alice is now, and as always been, an acquired taste. Having said that, this is an album that both compels instantly and offers vast rewards for repeated listening. Edgy, in the sense that little other music sounds like this and admittedly retro (why this is a bad thing I don't understand--although with Pearl Jam out now as well, it's starting to feel like a wrinkle in time!) perhaps it doesn't need to be defined at all. The band, as tight as ever, especially live, has had a lot of positivity directed towards them and they've earned it. They are also asked to meet and exceed very high standards. Not an easy task and they don't always succeed. For instance, the new singer, William DuVall, has a great voice. He is lost in the shuffle. Jerry Cantrell is an obviously skilled musician who has a perfectly fine voice--but I'm not really sure if he is totally taking the lead or not. I don't think he is either. It seems like a shame to not put DuVall to work more than they have. If the man has been tapped as the front and center singer, let him do his job or record as a trio. It's a waste of so much talent. So, the music is fine, but feels unfinished and a bit transient.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is an excellent game.  It has lots of elements in the game to keep everyone keep playing over and over.  The fun factor is 10/10.  I've been playing this game for more than 6 months.  It's brought many nights of fun to me and my friends.  It's hard to compete with console games in this digital age, but this game is still one of my favorites.  That says a lot about this board game.  I have the fishermen of catan expansion pack which I think is superb.  It's exactly what's been missing from the standard package, and it makes the port cities more desirable and it balances the game a little bit better.  One thing though, I think it's not as much fun when everyone is super serious about the game and makes it competitive. I enjoyed it the most when all the players are more chilled and willing to trade.  That way we can joke around a lot more.  With user interactions, I like this game more the Ticket to Ride.  Ticket to ride doesn't have trading and negociating, stealing and robbing going on, so it's more mild and less complicated.  so it's good for younger players.  They are both excellent games and well worth the money, I just like Catan a bit more.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|i love this movie more than love itself. it is one of the most amazing movies ever made period. BUT the quality of this blu ray is garbage. wait until the re-release or just get the DVD ...to bad it looks so awful...great movie
B0029LHW4U|5.0|This album has renewed my faith in hard rock music.  The first album to come along in a great while, other than Megadeth's latest, Endgame, that is good from beginning to end with absolutely no filler or abject nonsense.  The songs are heavy, melodic and memorable with the dual harmonies of Cantrell and DuVall  retaining the the dark and emotional power of AIC's past albums.  I highly recommend this very strong collection of songs, and encourage you to pick up the 12\\" record album pressed on clear vinyl which includes a CD as well.  Listening to this fantastic record with the gatefold spread across my lap made me realize that in this vast digital and sonic wastescape, there remain a few shining gems to hold onto.  Black Gives Way To Blue is indeed one of those gems.
0517548232|4.0|Overall, the book has some intersting points and facts but there are way too many times when the author uses too many words to get to one point. For example he'll use a lot of transitional phrases such as more over, furthermore, therfore, and in the other hand all together and it seems that he's just doing it to make the book longer. In my opinion, the book is ok but it's not the best.

B0007ZEO4G|5.0|Deep Purple had the ability to reinvent itself.  This album and the personnel replacement choices were true genius.  And when most drummers overplay it sounds like it.  \\"Lay Down Stay Down\\" demonstrates how Ian Paice by all standards is overplaying but every fill and lick is appropriate and fits the exciting song.    In a word \\"BRILLIANT!\\"

0439023491|4.0|I spent months cheering for Katniss and Peetah in their victory of The Hunger Games, but before all the ticker tape in my house was cleaned up along came Catching Fire and the capitol yanked my happiness right out from under me. I will not go into detail, as I would have hated someone to spoil this delicious book for me, but I will say it is as unputdownable as the original. My son and I have had long discussions about these books and now my daughter--who only reads because her teachers enforce it--is hooked and babbling on and on about Katniss, Peetah, Gale, and why on earth the Capitol would do such things. The only downfall to finishing Catching Fire, is the long wait until the 3rd book arrives. Truly a MUST read!<br />--Reviewed By Kerry O'Malley Cerra
068485743X|5.0|This book is adequately named. If you follow the instructions given, it will keep you out of the rejection file at least 90% of the time and that is pretty good odds. I am a published author  and getting my work into a publisher and not getting a rejection is important. I found this book chocked full of information that will be useful to anyone who has the desire to see their work in print. As a reference book, there is none I've found that can compare. I highly recommend this book and gurantee it to be money well spent for the knowledge gained.
B000031XCR|5.0|I recently bought another copy of this CD as a replacement for a misplaced copy that I have owned for quite awhile. This CD is simply wonderful.  It is a collection of Celine Dion's best and they are just that.  I highly recommend this CD.  Don't misplace it as I did. I hope the new owner is enjoying it as much as I do.  LOL!
B002G1X350|4.0|We waited all this time and what did we get? A good release.  Vinland Saga blew my mind. It was unexpectedly catchy and spectacular, at the same time new and original. This release is none of that. It's basically in a similar style as Vinland Saga but just lacks the character of before. It sounds more refined and like a more experienced band, but there is not as much experimenting with classical or emotional themes.     Firstly there are no good soft emotional songs. The soft songs they did just sound like crappier versions of their previous work (like Ankomst, Lovelorn etc. but not as good). The mixing sounds as bit muddy in places like I can't make out the words or individual instruments and I keep turning it up and I still have trouble making out certain parts. For the first time some of the songs on the album seem a bit boring almost like filler songs. Some songs could have been amazing but they screwed them up. Emerald Island sounds beautiful but then for no reason they have screaming growls over top of it which messes up the song. In some songs like on Vinland Saga the growls worked but here you have a perfectly good song ruined by grunts and screams. So most of the album isn't bad but fairly lame.    then you have a few really amazing songs. They sound more refined. They are radio friendly but still have that symphonic metal taste. The album overall sounds more like Nightwish or even modern Theatre of Tragedy. Through Our Veins is really good and Take the Devil in Me is really catchy and amazing song. Other than a few \\"hits\\" the album is the weakest release of Leaves Eyes to date.     Also the new drummer sounds great but they need a better guitar player who can write some good solos and some more interesting riffs. I'd say that is really what is holding them back. The guy wrote a couple good riffs then keeps reusing them because he can't come up with anything else. The same riff in the first album on Norwegian lovesong is then reused on Vinland Saga in the song Ankommst. Okay I can handle that, but then on Legend Land they did a song that sounded very similar. Okay. Now on this album they are playing the exact same thing again. That's like unheard of how can you keep playing the exact same riffs on different songs? then anytime he plays a solo he sounds like an amature or someone that should be the opening act or at a local bar or something. He's good but not big league good. I could probably write a better solo. Get somebody who can write some good guitar riffs and solos. Its starting to become a joke at this point. I think they just keep this guy in the band because he is a friend or something. Keep the lame guitar player but get at least one guy who can play guitar who is superstar material. You can't keep reusing the same riffs in every album or else people are going to stop buying it. Not to mention you become a laughing stock of the music community.
0545123267|5.0|Maggie Stiefvater's \\"Shiver\\" may seem like just another werewolf story when readers check out the book jacket, but, in fact, this YA novel is one of the greatest love stories I have ever read.  With characters that are unique and thoughtful, dialogue that is fluid and believable, and a story line that is just tense enough to keep us interested, Stiefvater's writing strikes a chord.      The opening line hooks the reader, \\"I remember lying in the snow, a small red spot of warm going cold, surrounded by wolves\\" while the chapters alternate between each character's voice and point of view, as well as the temperature of the setting.  Grace had been attacked by wolves when she was younger, and remembers one wolf in particular, the one with the yellow eyes.  Sam, bitten by a wolf as a boy, is that wolf.  He transforms between wolf and human form for a number of years, brought on by the seasonal changes.      Their fascination with each other over the years culminates into a face-to-face meeting after a wolf hunt where Sam gets hurt.  The relationship continues to develop as Grace's parents are just doing their own thing, but there is a foreseeable end to Sam's temporary human form.  This is the last time he is expected to change.      Instead of dwelling on the inevitable, these two enjoy their time together in a way that is refreshing and lively.  They talk and share stories with one another.  They sit quietly together to read or do homework.  They make quiche and they visit candy stores.    With the quiche scene, this book became so very real to me.  When Grace's \\"song\\" comes on the radio, she squeals with delight, dances with her boyfriend, and flours up her hands to make an imprint on his behind.      With the visit to the candy store, it is a moment that every sweet tooth or general foodie will enjoy.  Sam implores Grace to give in for once, to indulge instead of being her usual pragmatic self.  \\"Close your eyes and smell it.  Really smell it.\\"    \\"Peppermint swirledinto my nostrils, sharp as glass, then raspberry, almost too sweet, like too-ripe fruit.  Apple, crisp and pure.  Nuts, buttery, warm, earthy, like Sam.  The subtle, mild scent of white chocolate.  Oh, God, some sort of mocha, rich and dark and sinful.  I sighed with pleasure, but there was more.\\"      It is in these passages, you can feel the connection between these two deepen. It is in their shared experiences that you become more aware that time is running out for Sam to spend with Grace.      When Sam turns back into a wolf in an unexpected incident, we miss him in Grace's life by the reminders he leaves behind.  The reminders that he was real and their love was real are evident by the smell she can discern from books they read together and the places they went together.      Instead of a contrived ending, Stiefvater makes her characters critically think about survival.  Grace is smart and strong, even when she feels broken.  Sam is there, always there, and the friends that rally around to support these two make this a completely believable and true love story between a girl and boy, who was sometimes a wolf.

0385504225|2.0|Thanks to success of his last novel, Dan Brown has achieved the ability to do whatever he wants as a writer. The publisher will be happy just to have a novel with his name on it to sell books.  I have to believe this because I can't think any editor wouldn't hand this 509 page novel back to the writer and say, cut the fat out...about 100-150 pages worth.      Brown isn't a very good writer to begin with and I don't see any improvement in this novel. The characters are wooden and are not too bright or at least don't do very intelligent things considering how smart Brown makes them out to be.  There was one big twist towards the end that caught me off guard but I honestly don't know if that's because the book disinterested me so much up to that point that I didn't see it coming or because Brown was that good at getting one past me.     The overall Story was okay, how he got from point A to D I had a problem with and of course, the length of the novel. I don't mind that if a novel is over 500 pages long but at least make me think the 500 pages were needed to tell the story.  I had about 30 pages left of the novel and I said out loud, end this novel already.      To each their own but I won't be picking up the next Langdon novel.  I'll wait for the movie.
047119350X|1.0|There are no quantitative worked examples in any of the chapters! The authors leave it up to you to solve the problems<br />at the end of each chapter, and then consult the answer book: a pedagogical mistake! For you to solve some real-world<br />problems, you can't just rely on the derivations and presentation of their formulae, they need to show how the formulae can<br />be combined and rearranged to solve problems. Great color illustrations and plenty of detail, but not practical.
B00243FQFA|5.0|Another great boxed set from SGA - actually I believe I enjoyed the special features on this release a little more than I did the ones on Season 4's release. All in all, some of my favorite SGA episodes were in Season 5 so I was thrilled when this set finally arrived! In light of the untimely & unwelcome demise of the series, having this final installment of a wonderful series has off-set the SGA withdrawals a little bit. Actually my only complaint and only disappointment with this Season 5 release was knowing there wouldn't be a Season 6...
B002MW50KO|5.0|Just gonna make this short here... opinions will be all over the field on this one... but for me this is one of the more \\"musical\\" albums Dylan has ever released. Yeah, I know... \\"Christmas Songs\\"... but don't be too quick to dismiss the music that all these fantastic players and singers have created here. There is so much soul and depth to all that's going on, whether it's Bob's vocals or the excellent musicianship... give this one a try! Oh yes, even some \\"political\\" references in the very upbeat \\"Must Be Santa\\" w/ David Hidalgo wailing on accordian!

B002MW50KO|5.0|Ah, Bob Dylan. From Myth to has been to legend, all in one career.Now, an early Christmas gift, destined to bring cheer and food to needy folks. First off, Well Done Mr. Dylan.A great great thing to do. Secondly, a popping christmas album!Channeling Bing and Mel,[and the Harry Simeone Chorale} Dylan has actually put together a terrific album of Christmas music. Since folks speculate on everything with him, I dont care to wonder about his spiritual affiliation,simply the music. The best cuts here, for me, are the Little drummer boy, Do you hear what I hear,The Christmas song,and Hark the Herald angels sing. It's a straight album, no winking or cheesiness present.Imagine of Hank Williams Sr and Woody Guthrie made a Christmas album together. This is that album. Hugely,happily recommended
B002GY9F9K|4.0|There isn't a whole lot of fantasy material out there, especially since Merlin seems to have run its course. But it's nice to see Legend of the Seeker carrying on for at least another season. The first season got better as it went on, and seemed to follow the books more. But having only read the first few books, I'm not that bothered. All book to TV or film translations change so it's no use comparing. What you have on the screen is entertaining, nice to look at and well written. The lineage of writers is quite strong, with Mike Sussman, Ken Biller and Andre Bormanis so you know it will at least be interesting. Can't wait for season 2, with Charisma Carpenter and Jolene Blalock appearing. Charisma was on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, and Jolene was on Star Trek: Enterprise. Nice to see some stunt casting. I think the first season saw a lot of local talent, but few big names. I look forward to filling in some of the gaps from the first season with this box.
B002N7P23I|2.0|I rented this from Amazon and felt that I wasted my time and money for the following reasons:    1. The whole thing felt staged (forced acting, bad directing, shallow and predictable story).  2. Barely over an hour long (you need to do better than an hour in my opinion if you expect me to pay full movie prices).  3. Not scary in the slightest bit. In fact you could call this boring. I found myself on the verge of nodding off at points!  4. Absolutely God awful English dub!!! I would have rather Amazon had the original with English subtitles because this dubbing was plain garbage!    Save yourself the money unless you want to have a good laugh at a poorly done \\"horror\\" movie.

B000068QKT|5.0|I love this movie, it's the sort of pretty thing you can watch again and again. Some fans of foreign films or of this director will likely be disappointed by how \\"sappy\\" it is, which I can get, but I loved this movie despite any disneyesque qualities it has. It's very pretty to look at, it stirs up warm feelings and it may even leave you looking at garden gnomes differently.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Love this show!  Chemistry between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic is fantastic, and I love their witty banter.  The mysteries are always entertaining and intruiging, if not always 100% accurate, and the scenes with Castle and his family are awesome.  Molly Quinn and Susan Sullivan are fantastic.  The cast is great, the writing is great.  All around fun, entertaining show.  Love it!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I found this movie simply by viewing recommendations on Amazon that were similar to Persusasion (the 2007 BBC production.) I watched it once and was IN LOVE.     Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe have FANTASTIC chemistry and the story is not only beautiful itself (based on the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell) but it is acted and produced perfectly. This is a million times more amazing than any movie/BBC production I've ever seen (INCLUDING Pride & Prejudice- both the Firth and McFadyen versions.) The scenery is believable and brilliantly incorporated and the music also adds to the enchanting effect of this movie. Armitage certainly comes off as a callous and sometimes unfortunate looking man in the beginning, but by the end of this movie I would have just as easily married him. After seeing his softer side, I realized he is GORGEOUS! Funny how that happens, huh? ;D    All in all this review is short and sweet because my opinion is short and sweet. I bought this movie one week ago and have since watched it three times (Despite it being 4 hours long.) I also showed it to several relatives and friends who said it was one of the best movies they'd ever seen. So grab some popcorn and a blanket and curl up (by yourself or with a loved one) and watch this movie. You won't regret it. DEFINITELY worth the price and time.
630521610X|5.0|The town of Woodsboro is being haunted by a series of brutal murders.  But the focus seems to be Sidney Prescott (Never Campbell).  But this isn't your normal serial killer.  Instead, the killer has been influenced by the horror movies he or she has watched over the years.  Disguised with a Ghostface mask, the killer calls and daunts the victim before arriving to slice and dice.<br /><br />While most of the high school takes it as a joke, Sidney is taking it seriously.  But who around her might be the killer.  Maybe it's reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) looking for her next story.  What about film geek Randy (Jamie Kennedy).  Boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) is a suspect, so that makes him innocent, right?  Then again, any of these people might become the next victim.  Will knowing the rules of the horror genre help them make it out alive?<br /><br />Okay, so this is so NOT my normal genre of film.  And yes, it definitely earns its R rating with brutal violence and horrid language.  But I have always had a fascination with the genre, so when this movie became a surprise hit, I wound up checking it out.  And the mystery fan in me loved it.  The clues and red herrings are everywhere.  However, the jump factor had me going from the start as well.  Yes, I jump quite easily.  My roommate used to laugh at me watching this film, in fact.<br /><br />The thing that sets this apart from other slasher films is that we actually do get to know some of the victims before they die.  These aren't just the stock characters you'd normally find, but real people.<br /><br />Okay, so the other thing that set it apart is the humor.  These characters know they are in a horror fan and talk about how to make it out alive.  Of course, convention is thrown on its head (at times).  But that wink at the audience as it attempts to scare us silly adds to the fun.<br /><br />While most slasher movies still don't entertain me, I keep coming back and watching this franchise.  If you want your scares with a post modern edge, this is the place to turn.is the place to turn.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|It was good, but unlike his other books, it dragged a bit. There was too much that was restated over and over. The story line was great, as usual, though.
0345308239|3.0|I am sure you are familiar with the accusation on journalists where the editor says to the reporter here are the head lines go write the story and surround them with facts. The opening paragraph of this book introduces the headline thesis and then goes on to tell you how the story is about to unfold. I like that in an author. She goes on to provide a beautiful back drop in history as a collection of events where the common theme is a march of folly, that being irrational decisions made by leaders that goes against the better interest of their constituencies. The book is entertaining and a great summary of certain historical subjects, but her thesis is fraught, errors, omissions and with the same folly she thwarts upon leaders of state. She became wooden headed in her own argument.    In her introductory chapter she provides a general overview of moments in history that she could have chosen from. In her summary of WWI she discusses opportunities to have negotiated peace that were missed. She cites a German surrender when in fact an armistice was signed. This was indeed the Germans saying they were willing to negotiate a peace, only to be stabbed in the back. She also alludes to the Moor's conquering of Spain. She claims that Spain was taken by Africans who happen to be Muslims as opposed to Muslims using African manpower to conquer Span. She claims that Muslims contributed to Western civilization as opposed to conquered Westerners moving this forward. While I will not attempt to take a side in the case of the Moors, I point to the mere fact that Wikipedia has frozen the entries on the subject because of the contentious disagreement on the authors version. With these gross errors in framing her thesis I became a suspect reader.    She chose to speak on Troy, The Renaissance Popes, and The American Revolution from the British perspective, and Vietnam. Upon completion of the book I could not find a solid rationale for knitting these over others, to make her case. Infurther degradation of her case within each case I find merit in the suspicion I spoke of earlier. While I am not equipped to refute her historical research, in this review I only take an argument for the defense and use her rules of engagement in a post posthumous debate with any to take up her torch. Her rules are to judge the decisions made within the context of the time of the decision making and in context of what the decision makers knew. The consistent thread I found was that Barbara Tuchman provided evidence within her own history that acquits her defendants. Additionally, while she deluges the reader with the history she constructs; she leaves gaps, or errant inferences to construct her argument. In the case of Vietnam she closes with a paragraph citing an actual quote in history, while apparently true it disgraces anyone who gave their last full measure to that cause.    With the Trojan-Greek war after reading one thousand pages of the Iliad and the Odyssey I found it remarkable that of all the folly found with the Greeks in terms of why leaders take their people to war, I take issue with Tuchman's focus on the Trojan Horse...there is much more that I take issue with please to a keword search on cigarroomofbooks, march of folly
B002NXSRX4|4.0|im a big fan of gi joe but the trailers never seemed to catch my attention. when i watched this i had low expectations but soon realized the movie isnt that bad its actually good. not as exciting as the first ransformers but still a decent and entertaining movie that the family should love. i still think they should have put roadblock in here to make it complete.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|This album, in my opinion, is much better than Riot! The band definitely takes some brave, new steps into different directions.  I think pretty much the whole album could be made into singles honestly.  While it's not what fans may have wanted to hear following 2007's Riot, it's definitely elevates the band in my eyes and shows me that they can be versatile while still being awesome.  And man, Zac Farro solidified his status as a drumming beast.  He has grown alot since All We Know is Falling.  I enjoyed this CD and can't stop listening to it!
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Great delivery and great collection by MJ.  I was a moderate fan of MJ back in the 70s, 80s and 90s, but hearing old songs brought back great memories.  The best part is that I now share these songs with my kids, who enjoy them more than I do.  This is MJ at his best and the power of his music.  Also, the never before released songs along with newly released concert in Bucharest, Romania are stunning, it was even better than the one time I saw the original J5 in concert.  The special effects were ahead of their time.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon and Caiman!

B000XA5K48|5.0|Shoot 'em Up (2007) is an outrageously slick action flick, which seems to slide seamlessly between scenes jammed with amazing stunts, violence, and gunfire.  Writer and director Michael Davis, wanted his film to be 'guncentric', all about the heavy duty use of firearms, and except for the judicious use of a certain hard orange vegetable, that is pretty much what he has done.<br /><br />In a wild opening sequence, Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) intervenes to in plot to kill a pregnant woman, and by the end of it, dead bodies are strewn everywhere, Smith has delivered a baby, had a face to face meeting with top baddie Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti), done some wild sliding, some high flying, and has a new best buddy.  And that's just the beginning of an outrageously entertaining contest, between the quick-tempered and unstoppable Smith, and the ultra annoying, intuitive, ex-FBI 'forensic behavior consultant', turned killer, Hertz.  Along the way, pieces of the puzzle start to fall in place, in a cartoonlike story that is uberbizarre.<br /><br />In need of a babysitter, Smith turns to Donna Quintano (Monica Bellucci), a hooker who's specialty is servicing those with a lactation fetish.  \\"DQ\\" is soon forced to team up with Smith, after Hertz and his soldiers show up, looking for the boy.  Hertz is damn hard to kill, has uncanny tracking ability, and an almost unlimited supply of men.  The story has so many wicked twists, with shootout following inventive shootout.  The situations, setups, and stunts, just keep coming, and get more and more intense, peaking when Smith take a dive from a plane, and engages in an insanely exciting, and delightful gunbattle in the air.<br /><br />Hertz's annoying face appears once more, and this time Smith gets his fingers snapped like a bunch of carrots, but still won't reveal where the boy, now called 'Oliver' is.  When Hertz decides to get 'invasive', it's time for another miraculous escape, one that features a crazy and painful method for firing a bullet.  The finale in a Dairy Queen, shows Smith finding another way to employ that hard orange vegetable.<br /><br />If  you want a killer action flick that just never stops, Shoot 'em Up is definitely one of best in recent years.  Michael Davis had been doing smaller films, but this project proves the big time is where he belongs.  Davis provides an interesting, informative, and almost non-stop commentary track.  He repeatedly says that different things were included in the film, just because it 'made him laugh'.  There are some cool featurettes covering the making of the film, including the use of robotic stand-in babies.  Most movies do not live up to the hype, but this is the rare exception, and it may just make you laugh too.nale in a Dairy Queen, shows Smith finding another way to employ that hard orange vegetable.

0385504225|1.0|I had been looking forward to the release of this book for a long time and had high expectations.  That was my first problem.  My second was paying full price for this.  I kept waiting for it to get better all the way through to the last page.  By the end of the book I felt that I had been sitting in on a lecture that went on for too long.  This story line had real potential but just never got off the ground.  No real suspense, too much time describing location and movement and then no pay off at the end.  I'm still not certain what the real story was here and actually kind of resent coming away feeling as though I have been made to pay for a religious indoctrination I was not interested in hearing.  I hope he gets his mojo back because this book certainly doesn't display any of his earlier talent.  Seriously disappointing.

0553266306|5.0|\\"...The day of the Jackal was over.\\"<br />As you read the last sentence of the novel, you feel like a marathoner finally crossing the finish line; breathless, exhausted, your head spinning, but also euphoric and feeling you have just participated in a meaningful experience.<br /><br />The Jackal, a professional assassin, is hired by OAS, a now disbanded real life French militant organization, Organisation de l'armee secrete. His mission is to kill the French President de Gaulle (an actual historical figure). French authorities know of the mission and choose Inspector Lebel to identify and find the killer. The Jackal conducts research on his intended victim and then, despite Lebel's best efforts, relentlessly closes the gap between himself and his target. He uses any methods necessary, seducing and murdering men and women in order to gain shelter on his way to Paris. He is unstoppable.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that The Day of The Jackal was Forsyth's first fictional novel (originally published in 1971). You realize the writer's mastery when, as you read, you find yourself unable to let go of the feeling of dread and suspense, though fully aware de Gaulle was alive and well in real life, and therefore had to be that way in the book as well. Despite over 350 pages, the novel is a quick read. You forgo meals and become a stranger to your family, all in the effort to find relief in that last sentence:<br /><br />\\"...The day of the Jackal was over.\\"
1416594787|4.0|As a biologist (and evolutionist), I am one of those who did not need to be convinced by this book. I am already there. So, I was at somewhat of a disadvantage in trying to estimate how this book might affect the average creationist and IDer. One problem is that creationists come in several stripes----and I don't mean the usual division of creationists into young-Earth vs old-Earth etc. I mean the professional creationists such as some clergy (including TV evangelists) and foundation employees etc with a financial or power stake in maintaining creationism vs some people who have an ignorant, but honest, attachment to creationism for what might be called religious reasons (in spite of Dawkins and everything else) vs the hard-core religionists who care not a whit about evidence and who think that \\"faith\\" is faith, no matter what the evidence against it. Dawkins probably will not reach the first and third of these groups. Whether he is able to reach the second remains to be seen. Those people with an ignorant but honest attachment to creationism are largely unlikely to read (much less buy) a book such as this. I am at somewhat of a loss to know who this book targets. The Hell-fire and Damnation preachers will just ignore it and go on preaching---they have too much of a good thing in power and money flow to give it up by becoming honest. Dawkins needs to target the mainline Christian clergy. But then, who goes to church to listen to sermons on evolution?    As for the book itself, it took me a while to get used to the chatty style, mostly in first person, that characterizes Dawkin's later books. What Dawkins presents is only PART of \\"The Evidence for Evolution\\". He mentions once or twice that he had to jettison discussion on some point or another that would have added to the discussion (and to the length of the book). But if there is a lot of evidence, why not present all of it? He leaves out, for example, the embryologic evidence for skeletal homologies. Basically he only presents pictures of several skeletons and expects hard-core creationists to accept that bone X in a bat is homologous to bone X in a whale, etc. The creationist would say they these bones only appear to be homologous because are used in similar ways. Show the embryologic homologies and even the DNA evidence and the case is unassailable (to an honest mind). But Dawkins does not do this. Also, he does not present a detailed discussion of branchial arch homologies in fish and higher vertebrates. It may be mentioned (I don't recall), but a full discussion would have been unanswerable. Ditto for jaw and earbone homologies. Dawkins did not discuss retroviruses and missed a big opportunity there. Perhaps he thought that at some point he had reached overkill. I think the book is approximately a 90% effort, with too much good stuff left out.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|So the old Whitney has gone, wether it was age, what happened between then and now or merely just the inevitable the voice has been changed.<br />When I think of Whitney I used to think of those Bodyguard days as I am sure many people do, that crystal clear instrument she called her voice which became 'The Voice' but that has gone and been replaced by a slighlty husky but still very talented instrument.<br />I am not dissing this album, it is very very good, she has embraced a new sound, one that had evolved during her time out of the spotlight, she sings and she sings damn well, it's just saddening to think of what was to now what's left.<br />Tracks like Million Dollar Bill and the title track are all Whitney, but my absolute favourite is track number 9, For The Lovers, if it is released as a single this will be massive. Also a Song For You which is dance Whitney is another great track, the vocals are as clear on this as we're going to get on this album.<br />If you're a Whitney fan buy this, if you're new to her (you must be young or have lived under a rock for the last 20 years)then I still say buy it, but for those of use who remember, listen with new ears...and hope the voice returns.
B00140GXQU|5.0|I finally figured out what it is that makes Peter Hammill's vocal style different compared to every other singer I've ever heard- whenever he sings a vocal line, he actually sounds like he's reciting a poem or speech, haha.     Personally I LOVE that vocal style. I have no idea whether this band is self-indulgent, or whether they made this kind of progressive rock for nerds, or what kind of intentions Peter Hammill and the rest of the band had in mind. All I know is that Peter Hammill has a way of displaying this amazing style of emotions whenever he sings... but it's not an obvious kind of emotion. It's the kind of emotion that takes several listens to fully comprehend, I believe, because lyrically Peter Hammill looks at the world from a perspective a lot deeper than most people do.       In other words, the more you hear a Van Der Graaf Generator album, the more you GET what Peter Hammill is trying to do. He's a complicated guy apparently, and wants you to spend considerable amount of time trying to figure him out. I'm not being sarcastic there either- this is actually one of the things that makes Van Der Graaf Generator so appealing. It's not easily-understandable emotional music. That's why it's important to listen closely to the bands lyrics.     Peter Hammill's lyrics really feel incredibly powerful, and you get the feeling he's taking full advantage of the fact that he's a human being with a gift for a singing voice, and trying desperately to get through to everyone who's willing to take the time to understand his feelings.  Maybe there's better singers out there with more appealing (and prettier) voices, but I doubt most of them would be able to take advantage of their vocal range as much as Hammill does on these Van Der Graaf Generator albums.      It took me such a long time to understand what Peter Hammill is trying to do- he's not only trying to get through to me with his passionate and honest feelings, he's also making me expand my vocabulary and bringout the very best in me.  I'm a human being who has everyday problems just like everyone else.  Hammill's lyrics and emotional vocal range honestly helps me take time out of my day and understand who *I* am through the eyes of Peter Hammill.   Van Der Graaf Generator is all about pure emotion -sometimes raw and sometimes brutally honest- but always fascinating.    Now I KNOW sharing these kind of thoughts makes it appear like I'm some obsessive fanboy who believes Peter Hammill can do no wrong no matter what, but these are my honest feelings whenever I sit in the dark by myself and listen to any given Van Der Graaf Generator album.  So much feeling and beauty and honesty can be found here.   All you have to do is allow yourself to open up to Peter Hammill's lyrics and the rest of the bands distinctive style, and you might feel the same kind of emotional attachment.    I'm not sure where I'd put Still Life in my list of favorite Van Der Graaf Generator albums. Probably third, right behind Pawn Hearts and H To He- Who Am the Only One. Then again, Godbluff is pretty terrific too, but that album doesn't really display Hammill's emotional range (but then again, it DOES feature quite possibly the best lyrics Hammill ever made with the Generator gang).     But this isn't about Godbluff- this is about Still Life. \\"My Room (Waiting for Wonderland)\\" is my FAVORITE BALLAD EVER. Okay, maybe not a true ballad like the same way Aerosmith would write a ballad (goodness no!) It's actually a really depressing song.     In fact, what makes the song so appealing is the way the atmosphere and the soothing saxophone jams combine to capture a unique feeling of inner-peace. I feel immediate comfort in the quiet vocal melody, and feel curiosity as to what the future might bring for me while the final portion of the song (the saxophone jam) takes place.  The eerily quiet (and melodic) saxophone throughout the song haunts me in a way that makes me feel like I can escape any kind of severe depression that might try to take over my life.   Maybe not depression only- maybe anything.  Whatever kind of negative emotion I may be feeling the day I wake up can suddenly be changed into something I can control whenever I hear this song.      \\"Childlike Faith In Childhood's End\\" takes the enormously popular subject of heaven and death, and takes the lyrics to a whole new level of mystery and wonder (and sophistication).  I've *never* heard anyone take the all-important subject of life and death and make it seem so adventurous, mysterious and creative.  Peter Hammill looks at life from many different angles, and even explains them in a way that most of us would have trouble doing.  This is a total mind-blowing song lyrically.   \\"La Rossa\\" has lyrics about... I'm not really sure, haha.  I get the feeling they might be about a human being contemplating his thoughts after a bad relationship and trying to maintain the feeling of love through a lengthy period of troublesome roller coaster emotions.      The amazing thing is that the entire album, along with many other Van Der Graaf Generator songs, make me feel the same way.  I CAN overcome anything, and I DO have the strength to do so.  Again, I'm sorry if I sound like some obsessed fan who admires everything Peter Hammill and the band has done, but this music is absolutely *great* to me because it has more emotional value than most bands would understand be able to comprehend.  When you're honest with your feelings, you tend to get *through* to more people which allows them to open themselves up, and that's the case with Peter Hammill and specifically the Still Life album.      There comes a point when you realize you're an adult and there's no need to feel ashamed or embarrassed about anything because we're all human beings who are more or less the same.   You get the feeling Peter Hammill wants everyone in the world to find happiness and peace within themselves, and for everyone to get along with each other.    I love this song quite a bit. I sing it to myself all the time. Here, I'll sing it now! \\"I waaaaaaaait, by the dooooor, wondering when you will come, and keep me waaaaaaaarm\\". Okay, the melody is actually more fun and easier to understand the appeal when you HEAR it, and not when you read it, haha.     The title song is almost exactly the same way. \\"Pilgrim\\" has an uplifting vocal melody, with again, sincere and passionate vocals. The appeal is found in the fact that Peter Hammill actually MEANS what he sings, and that makes Still Life a classic in my mind. The rest of the album is pure emotional quality as well, both lyrically, and rewarding in that the music being created here HOLDS UP for many many years.  Get ready to love this album just as much 20 years from now.  It won't grow old, or stale.  It's too unique for that.  I love it.
B0025KVLS8|5.0|I've been a beatles fan ever since and the sound of this remastered cd is definitely better than the all the issues of this cd. It's worth your money.
0439023491|5.0|I can't even express how gripping this book is. It's every bit as good as The Hunger Games, if a little bit different in overall tone. I read it in five straight hours, it's that exciting.
1594488878|4.0|Several posters have held this book up for comparison to High Fidelity, which seems to be exactly what Hornby expects us to do: anyone possessing that sad mixture of compulsion, obsession, and narcissistic need to express every thought is going to put fingers to keys and say, \\"Well, it doesn't measure up to his previous work,\\" or \\"It far exceeds anything he's done before!\\" We're all Duncan, all of us self-styled scholars of All Things Pop.    It's a beautiful, artfully written and thoroughly believable book, something that made me think and made me smile and kept me pleasant company for a while.  It seems more fully realized than High Fidelity, but that's just me.      It also made me think long and hard about the way I look at art, and the way I look at artists, and the way I look at how other people look at them.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|Alice in Chains are back from the dead once and for all. BGWTB is an emotional,heartfelt album full of sludge metal rockers as well as beautiful ballads.Duvall is a great singer despite what all of the die-hard AIC fans will say and slander him just because he isn't Layne.Give this album a good listen and you will find that the band is still great without him.Songs like \\"A Looking in View\\" remind of Dirt era AIC with it's harmony vocals and awesome guitar licks.Jerry Cantrell is one of the best songwriters of all time and it shows on songs like \\"Last of My Kind\\". I loved this song as it reminded me of something from Facelift when it gets heavy in the middle but sounds demented all the way through. Other songs like \\"Check my Brain\\" aren't quite as dark but still very catchy and sound like a radio single(something AIC were quite good at). Absolutely love the title track and \\"All Secrets Known\\" as they were an homage to Layne's memory as well as new start for a band once forgotten and memory was lost and mimicked by crappy acts like Creed, Nickelback, and Shinedown.I gave it four stars just because I thought it could have had a few more guitar leads and maybe a few more fast-paced songs like Facelift nevertheless good album and I look forward to another AIC album.
0810983915|5.0|The Wimpy Kid is back with a vengeance. This time he leaves nothing to the imagination as he chronicles his boring summer vacation. I'm a 30-something wimpy kid and I love this series. Jeff Kinney's genius is he appeals to both adults and their kids in this series, in the way that Pixar does with its movies. The comedy is smart, realistic, and even teaches kids a thing or two.     As in his first few books in the series, Jeff Kinney writes a diary from the point of view of Greg, a kid that seems all-to-familiar. He would prefer to sit around all summer inside and play video games and watch TV. This time, his life gets upended when a dog arrives on the scene.     \\"Dog Days\\" lives up to the high standard of the first few Wimpy Kid books. The drawings are deceptively simple, yet convey emotion and show what can be done without color. The writing is biting, yet harmless enough for young kids. Great fun for big kids and younger kids alike - wimpy or not!
B0002858YS|5.0|I had never heard The Killers until I played \\"When You Were Young\\" on GH3.  I was impressed, and then downloaded HF from iTunes.  Not going to waste time by repeating whats already been said.  Great album, great band, can't believe I had never heard these guys.
B000UG78NG|3.0|i too am a little surprised at the glowing 5 star reviews for this book. I can only assume its the usual case of people marking 5 stars for any book \\"they like\\" as opposed to trying to rate books on an actual scale of 1-5. Where 1 star equals a total stinker and 5 star equals one of the best books you have ever read. A lot of Amazon reviewers, it seems, are either 1 star or 5 star reviewers, no compromise - grins.    Name of the Wind fits right in the middle for me, for a few reasons. First the writing was rocky here & there and reads like it was heavily edited. The start of the book was fairly confusing and shrouded in \\"mystery\\" - an inn keeper who is more than he seems, knows more than he lets on. It was only several chapters in that the book actually starts, as Kvothe begins to tell the scribe his story. It picked up a lot at that point. But why do we need this artificial plot device of the innkeeper telling his story to a wandering scribe and then (ala wayne's world) we do the flash back effect and then the real story starts. Why not let the story JUST be the tale of Kvothe from the very beginning, as a child in his parents wandering acting troupe. Why the artifice and (to me) wasted chapters that only exist to let Kvothe tell his story. Why not just TELL his story straight out. I guess its understandable as a first book.    You should know the bulk of this book is about Kvothe as a youth and his efforts to get into Hogwarts.. I mean the \\"University\\" where he can study magic. Sorry for the dig but I could not resist. I know Jk was not the first author to set a tale in a school for wizards (EarthSea ala Ursula LeGuin, etc.) Its just that the similarities between Harry Potter and Kvothe are pretty obvious. Both are prodigies of a sort, both have lost their parents at the hand of a \\"dark wizard\\", both are portrayed as the underdog who has taken a lot of hard knocks in life and whom we root for. The reason I bring this up is so readers understand this book is closeto being a \\"YA\\" (young adult) novel in many ways.     But on the good side, the characters are interesting, the magic system is fairly original and the story is not as cliche'd as I suggest. There is a fair bit of suspense and I enjoyed watching Kvothe struggle and scrimp to make his way in life - the focus on his money making attempts felt very real - a lot of characters in others stories just seem to \\"have\\" money as the author doesn't want to deal with the daily issue of life on the street. I applaud the author here for making that pretty integral. We sweat and fret with Kvothe over every talent and jit he earns. When another character steals Kvothe's property at the end and destroys it, we are outraged! Do you know how long it took to earn that?! Hahah.    Regrettably, the book ends on a cliffhanger and the author is mum on when the sequel is coming out. So we get to pay $$ for a story that is incomplete. I really wish more authors would try to reach some sort of conclusion in a book rather than literally just stop writing as if they had -       (see what i mean? it stinks imho)
1407109421|5.0|I recall clearly the day I began reading this trilogy.<br /><br />My feeling on the first few pages was 'oh dear, this isn't going to be my kind of book'. The next few pages found my intrigue growing, by the time I finished I was totally immersed in his world of demons and battling polar bears and hoped it would never end.<br /><br />Superb story telling craftmanship and a totally rivetting, mind stretching plot with unique devices throughout that work beautifully.<br /><br />You must read this trilogy!<br /><br />But what do you read after it?<br /><br />I would move back to an earlier classic with a different but equally compelling tale and read [[ASIN:0812967127 The Day of the Triffids (20th Century Rediscoveries)]] .
B0015DROBO|5.0|The publisher's description of this book is an accurate accounting of what it contains, so I won't completely rehash it here.  I will say that it's very well written - the scenes, events and characters flow seamlessly and it's hard to put down. I loved the characters, and what is a book but it's characters? I pulled for the quirky, tough, mighty mouse Lisbeth, the socially laid back, professionally driven Mikael, the funky new-age married Erika, and the kindly, sickly, closure-seeking Henrik. I believed and sympathized with all the good guys in this one, and found it easy to loathe the bad guys.<br /><br />This book has a great ending. I love happy endings. I love happy endings that are logical, believable and consistent with prior events. The author pulls it all together and left me wanting more.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this book was written in Swedish and translated to English. The translator did a wonderful job, making the book read very well in English, yet keeping the Swedish feel to it. I think translating a piece of writing this large must be a painstaking task, and my hat's off to whoever did this one.

It's incredibly simple to do but requires passion, hard work, focus, persistence, and authenticity. Follow your passion with as much intensity as possible, be authentic, be real, be honest and sincere. Gary shows you how to use the latest tools in the social media field to create the largest pool of potential customers. He repeats the simple formula throughout the text to reinforce how fundamental it is but also makes it clear that it's not necessarily easy to do or even possible if you are not passionate about your chosen field, if you do not put in the effort, or if you give up too easily. Examples are given to prove how anyone has the potential to crush it, from baseball cards to stickers, real estate, and more. There are lists of websites to visit for using the latest tools and technologies in social media along with his recommendations. Some of the tools mentioned in detail include: WordPress, Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Viddler, and UStream.tv<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is more of a high level businesss /marketing / motivational text and not a software programming / application manual. You are given general directions on how to use tools but no actual HTML/CSS/XML or scripting code. You are also not given details on how to design banner ads, blog themes, or webcopy / ad copy.

B000PFU7OO|4.0|After seeing Once I was interested in buying the soundtrack since I liked the movie and the songs.  After listening to the soundtrack without the movie I am a little disappointed.  I think the songs lose something when they're separated from the movie.  Maybe my expectations were a little too high.  It's still a pretty good album.
B002MW50KO|3.0|I gave this three stars before it arrived.  Now, I am trying to rebut my own review, but I can't take away five more stars!  Do not listen to the people posting good reviews.  They are either being paid, or have imaginations beyond imagination.  I love Christmas music, and this is the worst Christmas album I have ever heard.  It is the worst album I have ever heard, period!  Bob had his day, but his day is gone.  Seriously, my dog did not even howl when I played this CD; he just ran out of the house whining and I have not been able to locate him since.  Yes, it is a good cause, but do yourself a favor and just donate the money, unless you want to play the album in your basement to scare away the mice. Hey, there's a thought!  If you have the album, and you have guests who don't know when to leave over the holidays, put this CD on right away.  It is sure to clear the room no matter the size!
0061914177|4.0|Are you living, or just earning a living? So asks wine critic, social media star and business consultant Gary Vaynerchuk in his new book, Crush It!<br /><br />The premise of Crush It! is that technology has disrupted the historical boundaries of business, making it possible for anyone with knowledge and passion to build a business that capitalizes on that expertise.<br /><br />Generally, he's right. I've built a community and a business at [...] by adhering to many of the principles in this book. However, I've started five companies previously, and prefer working for myself. Your results may vary.<br /><br />Certainly, like Trust Agents by Chris Brogan and Julien Smith, Crush It! is targeted at entrepreneurs and would-be solo acts that are itching to strike out on their own, and need the nudge to do so. This is not a book for corporate marketers.<br /><br />The success path painted by Vaynerchuk is paved with content. Audio, video, written. It doesn't matter, so long as you make a lot of it. And that really strikes at the core of the Gary Vee vision, which is that the future of business is in hyper-targeting. Finding the cracks and crevices and building content-driven enterprises that can fill the needs of those small but passionate audiences. In many ways, this notion dovetails with Chris Anderson's The Long Tail.<br /><br />To some degree, however, this advice is self-limiting. Most often, hyper-targeted niches can be capitalized upon, but by definition the size of that opportunity is narrow. That doesn't mean it isn't viable, and to his credit Gary frequently balances millionaire dreams with \\"make a living\\" reality in the book.<br /><br />Expertise combined with differentiation. Although he doesn't describe it that way, that's the Vaynerchuk content success equation.<br />I certainly agree with the differentiation component. It's one of the things I struggle with personally. How do I stand apart from the other social media consultants? It's important, and the book provides a few interesting examples.<br /><br />The expertise side, however, is trickier. The book presumes that anyone can Crush It! Of course, anyone can start a blog, and market it well. But, do they have the expertise to transform a category? To me, it seems like you need to have a very solid knowledge base before heading down this road. Perfect for prosumers. For others without existing expertise, it will be tough to break through.<br /><br />There are many parallels between Crush It! and Tim Ferriss' 4-Hour Workweek book. Similar size, approach, and subject matter, especially the concept of monetizing your passion. Ferriss even blurbs the cover of Crush It!.<br /><br />I find it extremely interesting that Vaynerchuk unabashedly describes the extremely long hours required to successfully implement his methods, at one point encouraging parents to work from 9pm to 3am daily. Alternatively, Ferriss' premise is to work less, not more, using automated business and shortcuts to save time and enjoy life.<br /><br />(I would love to see a Vaynerchuk vs. Ferriss debate on this issue, as they propose contradictory ways to achieve the same outcome)<br /><br />Although a bit repetitive at times, and not particularly detailed, Crush It! is a motivating, entertaining book that I believe you'll find yourself returning to over and over for a shot in the arm.<br /><br />Everyone self-employed, or desiring to be self-employed, should pick up a copy of the book.<br /><br />It reads like a 90-minute conversation with Gary, and that's time well-spent.ise side, however, is trickier.

B002RB7VMA|4.0|I have listened to this only a couple times so far.I think this will develop into a \\"love it\\" soon. I am a fan, but not a fanatic of MB. Good solid piece of work. I love the song selections on this recording. It flows together nicely. I like the arraingements on most of the covers but understand some people just cant get past the original old sounds.I love to hear old music given new life personally.  The cut with Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings is great!   Give this a listen you will not be dissapointed.
0385340990|2.0|I had heard raving reviews about this book, I'm still not sure what the hype is all about. It is predictable and characters are difficult to relate to. The book's idea to write it all in the form of letters makes for a dis-jointed, unbelievable story. I forced myself to finish it, with hopes that it would get better, unfortunately, it didn't. Historical fiction is one of my favorite genres, but there are many other WWII era novels that are much more enjoyable.
0307269981|5.0|What IS it about the characters in Stieg Larsson's books?  I cannot put my finger on what makes them so compelling to me...but I simple couldn't (or didn't want to, at least) put \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" down.  I enjoyed this book so much that I kept finding my eyes trying to sneak ahead of me to see what would happen next.<br /><br />In my reviews, I usually include several quotations from the book to make my points, but I don't have any for this book.  Mostly because I didn't want to take that kind of time when I could be reading.  (OK - I know I'm getting gushy, sorry.)<br /><br />\\"The Girl\\" books are thrillers...but ones with real characters.  Characters that the author didn't just pull off a shelf and start pulling the strings...but characters that are well drawn and compelling to read about.  Characters that made me very interested to find out what would happen next.  Characters that made me put the book down with 15 pages to go on a Sunday morning and spend the whole day wanting to pick it back up...but not wanting to finish the book.<br /><br />And then upon finishing it that night, curse that the next book wouldn't be out for a while and be sad that the man who created these wonderful characters died.  There will be one more book of his to savor...and that's all.<br /><br />May \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" be out soon.
0920236251|4.0|This is great. So, this girl - a princess (well, duh) is about to (eventually) get married off. Unnnnnfortunately, a dragon burns everything and steals him.    So, using the time-honored tradition of \\"making the dragon boast and brag himself to sleep\\", our princess rescues the prince... only to find out that he only cares about appearances. As she says, he is a \\"bum\\". And they don't get married.    What's not to like about this story? It's funny, it's short, and it makes a good point: Looks don't matter, and anybody that ungrateful after you save his life is NOT worth your time.    Before you purchase this book, please note that the \\"Annikins\\" editions of Munsch's books are specially sized to fit into little kid hands. If you check the product dimensions you'll see this edition is only about three inches square. If you need a bigger book, you'll need to get a different edition. If you purchase the small edition you are NOT allowed to come back here and whine about it. It's your own fault for not reading the product information!
0756405890|4.0|The characterization in this book and the writing are excellent, but I couldn't stop thinking I've read this story before.  <spoilers>  Let's see -- there's the acceptance at the great school of wizardry where Kvothe comes into contact with a spoiled noble brat who hates him because he is more intelligent and a better wizard.  I'm sure that's Earth-Sea. It's ironic that Ursala K. LeGuin writes a review on the jacket. This book is better written and the characterization is richer, but it is missing the gravitas of their actions.  Instead of releasing a demon following the climactic battle, our hero gets six lashes.      Then there is the beautiful woman who floats in and out of his life --the object of his constant desire and wholly (irritatingly) unobtainable.  If that weren't enough, there are several 'nice girl' candidates who would like nothing more than share the rest of their lives with the hero.  If he finally decides he has always loved the nice girl Fela, only to arrive at her wedding to his arch enemy -- I'll scream!    Overall, many reviewers have suggested that the book started out slow.  It's hard not to agree.  I actually put the book down, read four other books and then finished this one.  I'm glad I did because I was richly rewarded.  I was not bothered by the transition between past and present, as I suspect Kvothe must prove himself again at the end of the final book.  The reason I only give it four stars is because while there are a number of events in the novel, but very few of any real consequence.  The ending was particularly disappointing, as there was no real ending to speak of.  And now we get to see who completes the next book first -- Rothfuss or Martin.
0385504225|3.0|What I liked:<br /><br />- There are some passages which are I-can't-put-this-down exciting.<br />- The history behind certain words and symbols.<br />- The short chapters which make this an easy when-I-can-fit-it-in read.<br />- The science vs. religion theme.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br /><br />- I was able to predict many aspects of the ending within 98% accuracy half way through the book.<br />- It seemed like the whole book was a repetitive series of disbelief-discovery-awe-disaster.<br /><br />Bottom line: I would recommend this if you enjoyed Dan Brown's other works.

1906694176|5.0|For those of you who have not read the first two volumes of this trilogy, I urge you to start on Volume one and proceed. The characters are so complex and real that an understanding of their background seems to me to be a must. The first two novels set up the reader for this wonderfully clever conclusion. The tale of good versus evil is one that is a history in time, and Stieg Larsson has given us a treat to savour.<br /><br />The first one hundred pages of the third novel brings us up to date, and then we start the real read. More characters are introduced and at times during this 600 page read, I wondered if I could keep them straight. For the last two hundred pages, this book is very hard to put down. This is a tale of a series of conspiracies and how they come to cloud the Swedish democracy. How did Lisbeth Salander become the abused young woman, and will the people and times trying to destroy her win? And, Mikael Blomkvist, the journalist, will he be able to expose through his words, the wrongs that have been done. Will he regain Lisbeth's confidence?<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is in the Intensive Care Unit, she has been shot in the head. Her father is in a room down the hall, reportedly shot by Lisbeth. How did this come to be. Why are the Swedish Secret Service surreptitiously going in and out of his room? Why do we pick on those we do not understand? It is easier for us to believe those that are in power than to question the truth. The theme of the trilogy is that women are equals. There is no unnecessary overt sex and even though there is violence, it is believable. Blomkvist is a hero, he is the main antagonist and the muscle behind the investigation. He is out to assist Lisbeth Salander in becoming the woman she is meant to be instead of the woman who was looked at as the mad lesbian killer. He says, \\"When it comes down to it, this story is not primarily about spies and secret government agencies; it's about violence against women, and the men who enable it.\\" The characters who surround them are wonderfully sketched out. We can picture in our mind's eye their faces and their countenance. This novel sums up the story of Lisbeth Salander, but leaves us wondering what is to be. Unfortunately, Stieg Larsson. because of his death, won't be continuing the series, it is up to us to find her rightful place.<br /><br />It is easy to understand why this trilogy of Stieg Larsson's has become such a phenomenon. The search for justice and truth from a young, abused woman who has the nerves and strength of steel gives us all hope. We can believe through this wonderful narrative that the world is indeed a good place.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 10-13-09<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307269981 The Girl Who Played with Fire]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)]]cters who surround them are wonderfully sketched out.

0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown's new book, The Lost Symbol, spends 500 pages pointing toward the ending.  It is indicated throughout that this ending will be more of a definitive conclusion. The last page loomed large, but 509 came and went, at best, with a whimper instead of a bang.  Granted the most difficult thing about this book would be the ending.  Well, it still is.    What we have here is a fast read, if you omit the ridiculous Italicized phrases and the fact or fiction aspects that flow throughout.  The pages per chapter average less than 10, therefore creating frequent edge of the seat anticipation which only rarely occurs. And in a nutshell, this well publicized addition is no more than a change in location from his previous \\"humdingers\\". It is a mixed bag of tricks, a hash, but in this case a rehash.  DaVinci and Aliens offered something new, exciting and predictable.  Lost offers only Washington D.C. and the predictability of his previous efforts.  To me it was the Same Old, Same Old....perhaps an adult type of Harry Potter falling short.    Why 3 stars then.  Well, the anticipation was worth 1 or 2, the effort was worth 1 or 2, but the result...you can draw your own conclusions.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|I first viewed this movie 40 years ago, and it remains one of my all-time favourites, although I have no special interest in westerns. Casting the usually genial good guy Henry Fonda as a ruthless killer, and usually bad guy Charles Bronson as hero, was a stroke of genius.    From the railway scene close-ups at the beginning, to Frank's final \\"Who are you?\\" in the chilling flashback scene near the ending, the whole movie is an unforgettable feast of mesmerising camera work, great acting and intriguing (if improbable) story line that keeps you guessing until the aforementioned flashback scene. And Claudia Cardinale is irresistible.    If you're even remotely interested in Sergio Leone or spaghetti westerns, this movie deserves a place in your collection.
B001UDYI9K|5.0|Listening to Woolfson's voice is better than a day at the spa.  The songs are very reminisent of the Alan Parson's Project.  I could listen to them all day (and have).
0385341008|4.0|So interesting to learn about Guernsey and war time. I found that I needed to concentrate fully while getting into the book, in order to remember who was whom. In fact, I re-started it after a few nights of reading a few pages and falling asleep!! Well worth it though. My mother in law, who was in the WAF in the UK during WWII loved it, big time.
1579128149|3.0|Love the photos, scientific facts, and technological tidbits. My enjoyment was offset by the frequent injection of environmentalist value judgements that added nothing to the science. I mean, jeez, ok, I get that the author hates incandescent bulbs already. The book would have been greatly improved if Gray had stuck to the science and kept his politically-correct opinions to himself.
0061914177|5.0|Gary's passion and drive overflows from this excellent quick, but focused, book.  After tuning into Vaynerchuk a few years ago, I can honestly say that Gary is the real deal.  He practices what he talks about in this book 110% and the energy is contagious.<br /><br />Some of the key points that people so often miss is that it not only takes passion, but extremely hard work and patience to succeed.  In addition to these chariticteristics, being a trasparent and authentic person is what it will take to win in today's game.<br /><br />His book not only provides the guiding principles, but directs readers to additional resources to start building their own businesses and brands.<br /><br />Having had the opportunity to get to know Gary more through the Big Omaha event and elsewhere, I must say that Gary's motivation has been instrumental in my, and countless others, who are working on a daily basis to follow their passion, do what they truly love as well as, most importantly, staying true to what really matters in life.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I purchased the Buggy Buddy to go with my new Graco IPO stroller.  It attaches to individual handles or a single handlebar.  The pictures aren't clear enough to show that the cup/bottle holders expand to hold many different sizes and it holds them snuggly.  There is a zipper pocket for keys, cell phone, etc. and a decent amount of open space for whatever else you need.  My stroller still folds easily with the Buggy Buddy attached.  Perfect solution for smaller strollers w/out a parent tray.
0810983915|3.0|My ten year old son, who finished the book in two hours says....    \\"The book was not worth fifteen bucks, but it was like the third best in the series. They could have done a better job. I didn't like how their was no like no school involved and it was all summer. It was funny because they get pets and Roderick wants to name it terd!\\"    Overall, two hours of pure silence is totally worth the price. :)
0385504225|2.0|I have a hard time criticing an author because I respect their abilities.  I am a reader.  So, from a reader's point of view this book was lousy.  By the time I was three quarters of the way though I forced my self to keep reading because I spent the money.  I would really like to have that money returned.  The last few pages totally broke down into one or two sentences per paragraph just to cram in all the stuff that did not work for the story.  No suspence, minamal character developement, no thrill,no Di Vinci Code thats for certain. Save your money!
B001EN71DG|3.0|I have been waiting to get this on DVD for a while. The scenes are remastered and the sound is excellent along with the effects. The shortfall is they changed some of the scenes so this set is not as I remember the original. If you can get over some added scenes and changed endings then you will enjoy this DVD set.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I was very disappointed with this book. I was so looking forward to it and had it pre-ordered and it was definitely not worth the wait. I love to read and usually read a book in 2-3 days if it's good. This book took me two weeks and I can't count the number of times I almost quit reading it.     Dan Brown - if I want to be lectured to I'll take a college course and if I want to be preached to I'll go to church. You're book is a work of fiction and I expected to be entertained. I was not at all.    I guess you met your goal with it though. You made a great deal of money from hanging onto the coattails of your previous books. But in my book you really let down your fans.
B001GCUNW6|5.0|I was on the fence about this movie, but the reviews here told me it didn't include the 3-d and that's great, 3-d gives me a headache, it doesn't add to the story, and I don't want to pay extra for features I don't use. Thank you Amazon!
B001DF68MA|3.0|I have been looking for a front mounted baby bike seat for my son for several months and finally decided to purchase the WeeRide based on all the wonderful reviews.  I am a single mom of a 2.5 year old, with very little extra time on my hands and was very grateful for the easy installation.  The next morning when my son awoke we went for our first bike ride together.  At first I was very hesitant because I couldn't get his feet in the foot holders...I thought his shoe might be too wide, I stuffed him into the seat and strapped him on, (he might not have fit if his diaper had been full)but he loved being up front and being able to see everything.  He loved his steering wheel and feeling the wind in his face...and then I tried to make a sharp turn and pinched his knee between the handle bars on my bike and his seat.  This happened twice, I'm pretty adaptable, I was willing to make wide turns when necessary if he loved riding with mommy, plus he's very tall for his age and my choices are extremely limited.  Even the local bike stores were of no help.  After about an hour he was done and didn't want to ride on mommy's bike any more...\\"my seats too small mommy\\"...    Before purchasing I did call the 800 number to ask about dimension and the woman I spoke with was absolutely no help, she said,  \\"all I know is what you have read in the description.\\"  What's a mom to do??
0739383728|5.0|Highly recommended read for anyone who enjoys running... and for those who don't.  The story is great and the book is packed with history and information about running and shoes.
B000TEUSJU|5.0|I have been looking for this DVD for a few years now so I'm very happy to finally have it.  It did take a couple of extra days to get here than what I was told would be the delivery date but thats ok.  I have not yet tried to play it so I hope it works on my DVD player...
B00005UW9T|4.0|this is a great movie and very entertaining for our daughter. she loves it and likes to watch it over and over and over. Thats all for now
1591841666|5.0|The subtitle sums it up - this is \\"a little book that teaches you when to quit and when to stick.\\" This book is small (even for a Seth Godin book) at just over 80 pages - however it's jam packed with value. As with Seth Godin's other books, the small size is deceiving - although I could have easily read this in under an hour, it took me several due to my taking notes after every page or so given the useful advice. The Dip is a powerful analogy and will change the way I think of challenging situations. This book provides a simple but useful methodology for determining whether you should undertake, continue with, or quit a given situation. Although the advice flies in the face of conventional advice, I believe the advice is sound and worth considering given the strong arguments made. I highly recommend \\"The Dip\\" - it's a quick read and provides great advice!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|While it was entertaining, it was not at the level that I expected. It seems Dan had to actually stretch himself this time and try to make the publishers happy.
B001FB55I0|5.0|Terminator Salvation is an extremely beautiful action movie. We finally get an entire movie based around the future war. Not only do we get to see the classic terminators, but we get a ton of fascinating new implements of Skynet. Watching this movie on Blu-Ray will be an amazing experience.
031606792X|3.0|The first book to me was the author dealing with the unresolved teen issue of loving the vengeful, horrifying Judeo-Christian God. Edward is perfect in all respects, except he's the most dangerous, powerful being around... yeah. The second one's about resolving \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and the third about \\"Wuthering Heights\\" and the fourth about the fear of childbirth. I am happy for the author to work through her issues and fears in this way. It was kind of interesting to observe that unfolding in books, too.    I read the series because my daughter and her friends were reading and discussing it. Actually, at first I read the first chapter of the first book and could not bring myself to continue because of grammar and \\"teenage target audience\\" issues. Then kids bugged me to read more of it so I could snark it together with them (I suppose, because that's the only discussion type I heard from them) - so I tried again.     The first book has serious editor (grammar and style) issues, but it got better. It took me about a book and a half just to suspend the disbelief. I wish the dialogue and descriptions of characters' beauty, clothes and cars were about 90% shorter. There were scenes I definitely enjoyed, some moments beautifully written.    I can see that the book was created with love, which gives it a certain genuine feeling. I don't like this whole genre, but even from this position I see the author didn't just work on it \\"from 9 to 5\\" - it was the real thing for her. I can respect this. I hope Ms. Meyer takes the advice of many fine writers (\\"write your prose, then make it 40% shorter\\") and keeps doing what is, obviously, deeply meaningful for her.    I find it extremely amusing that some people hated books one, two, three and four, found nothing whatsoever interesting or beautiful in them, and yet read the whole series, and took time to leave reviews too. This seems counter-intuitive and counter-productive. Why, people? Why?
0061914177|5.0|[[ASIN:0061914177 Crush It!: Why NOW Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion]]    Short review:  BUY THIS TODAY!  It will change your life and those around you.  It is inspiring, meaty, challenging, and full of HOPE!  Warning:  you may lose sleep.    Long review:  I just recently discovered who Gary Vaynerchuk is and now have read his book; I absolutely believe that this will be a book you will not forget.  It is so inspiring you may want to read it standing up.    Gary Vaynerchuk's own story will fascinate you as you see how he became who he is.  Crush it! has simple lessons and simple rules to success in life, but he shoots ideas and inspiration and logic and honesty like a constant stream of gorgeous fireworks.  The author's tone feels like a mentor, teammate, cheerleader, boss, parent, best friend, life coach, and guru.    If you've forgotten or left your dreams and passions behind, those thoughts will come flying back to you as you read.  He shows you how you can live and work at your PASSION and not just a job.  He tells you how to be flexible and change with the times, not just be rigid in your expectations.  He shows you how he does it and how you can see the big picture and the end goal and how to get there, even with setbacks, detours, or roadblocks.    You can read this in one quick sitting, but you'll likely go back to reread it and keep jotting down your ideas.  This is an energizing book of HOPE, direction, inspiration, instruction, and even a kick in the rear.    Crush It! is a great gift for entrepreneurs, friends, enemies, bosses, former bosses, people out of work, and the president and CEO of your company.
080508990X|5.0|This book is of good quality but the shipping on it was slow.  I ordered a set of books from a different company at the exact same time and the other books arrived in 5 days this was 2 weeks.  I know that when I checked the status it hadn't left the warehouse for the longest time.  It was very frustrating as far as the amount of time it took.
B00169N0BK|4.0|After doing thorough researching all over the Internet for what to get for a hardware color calibration solution, I finally settled on this one for the main reason that it is the cheapest spectrophotometer you can get under $500. All the other solutions like the Eye-One Display 2, Spyder 1/2/3 are simpler (and thus cheaper) colorimeters, which are supposedly not as accurate. I wouldn't know, as I have not used them to compare and contrast between this Colormunki. I was also thinking of getting the Eye-One Pro ($1000+ solution), but after using this Munki, I can safely say the price will not be justified for what I need it to do (photograpy with editing/post-processing in Lightroom and Photoshop).<br /><br />In any case, the product arrived much sooner than the tracking suggested (delivery estimate of Oct. 17th). In fact, I got a knock at the door, not knowing it was the postmaster delivering this very item. Shocked that it came almost a week before it was estimated to be due. So kudos to Amazon for that fast delivery service on a FREE Super Saver shipping rate.<br /><br />However, using Windows 7 RC build 7100, I initially ran into a hiccup because the drivers would not install upon plugging in the device via USB. My guess is that Windows 7 does not yet implement these drivers natively (like it does most other devices, notably printers). So just a fair advise to those in Win7 RC, this device is not true Plug and Play (yet).<br /><br />To alleviate this, I went into Device Manager after connecting the device to the USB port and expanded the \\"Other Devices >> Colormunki\\" and double-clicked to bring up the properties. From there, go to the \\"Drivers\\" tab and update the drivers by clicking on the appropriate button in that tab. I just simply let windows install drivers \\"Automatically\\" and it did a fine job of doing just that. I can't decide whether Windows got the drivers from the Internet or from the CD the device came with, but both were accessible to Windows when I did this, so your mileage may vary, depending on your connection and disc availability. Within a minute, drivers were installed and all were good to go.<br /><br />Profiling was a breeze. In fact, I am actually shocked at how easy it was to do and am asking myself now if the product was really worth this amount. The device itself looks like it was made for $10 and costs no more than $50 with everything out the door at the manufacturer's end. But the fact that it costs $360 on Amazon (and up to $500 retail) is astounding. So there is a difference in what my display (Samsung SyncMaster 225bw) looked like before and after, but after doing multiple runs and profiles, I got a consistent result I could finally just keep. However, if the cost of simply making sure you set your display's Brightness and Contrast to bring it down to a level you were not using before is worth $360 to you, by all means, I'm sure this product does what it's supposed to. However, I'm still scratching my head as I type this wondering if I could have done this myself without such an over-priced (imo) device (Brightness set at 31, Contrast at 90). Yippeee!may vary, depending on your connection and disc availability. Within a minute, drivers were installed and all were good to go.    Profiling was a breeze.

However, as a 27 year old reader of all types of genre books I found the series quite appealing. Don't expect action packed writing or mysterious plots. It is a 'feel good' read that creates a rather good story in your head.

B0026NWBY2|3.0|OK, I'll admit:  this release annoys me.  I've been waiting for a definitive George Harrison repackaging that includes his best rock songs and omits the pop ones.  This new release omits some of his key rockers:<br />- Beware of Darkness<br />- Devil's Radio<br />- Crackerbox Palace<br />- (I Am A )Dark Horse<br />- You<br />- No Travelling Wilburys songs (End of the Line, Handle With Care- Harrison penned)<br />- Cloud Nine<br />- If Not For You<br /><br />I just don't understand how ANYONE with access to his catalog hasn't figured out by now that NO Harrison Compilation album/cd has been inclusive yet.<br />Some of the compilations I understand: they only covered the early George Harrison on Apple, or Dark Horse, or his later albums, but NONE of them include his best material.  Whoever is selecting these are missing the boat on a huge money-maker that would include some of George's best hits and best rockers.<br /><br />The remastering is fine, but some of the songs sound 'too clean' for me.  Harrison was best when he sounded fresh and acoustic, and not over-produced.  The albums that WERE over-produced tanked and sold so poorly they went out of production for 17 years in CD form.<br /><br />If you were looking for 'Something' that covered Harrison Post-Beatles period inclusively, this ain't it.  Still, song for song, they are excellent, even great, but the Harrison Catalog people missed a golden opportunity for a George Harrison album that hasn't been released yet.<br /><br />Jeff
0786868724|5.0|\\"Will you do my eulogy?\\"    This is the question that Rabbi Al Lewis asks Mitch Albom at the start of his first nonfiction book since TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE. And this question is the start of an eight-year relationship between Albom and the good rabbi.    After years of going through the motions attending synagogue on high holidays with his family, Albom is surprised one day to have \\"Reb\\" tap him for the ultimate honor of delivering his eulogy when the time comes. As a child, Albom performed all the rituals of the Jewish religion by rote, all the while praying for a dog and rewriting the Ten Commandments to include \\"Honor thy older siblings\\" with his younger brother in mind. As an adult, he married a Christian and declared himself an atheist. But rekindling his relationship with the rabbi brought back a flood of memories from Hebrew schools and services. And Albom intersperses these often humorous childhood reflections throughout his book as he describes how his reconnection with the rabbi evolves.    Strained, almost perfunctory visits morph over time into happily anticipated and cherished exchanges. As they meet over the court of the next four years, the \\"larger-than-life man of God\\" who stood at the lectern each week \\"was shrinking down to human size.\\" Albom learned the history of the man who for so long had been a mysterious figure in the hallway at school. The Reb shares how he became a rabbi (in a line of many rabbis in his family), how he met and wooed his lovely wife Sarah, how they tragically lost a child, and how he nurtured and loved his congregation, flaws and all. He revealed to Albom all the nuggets he had gleaned from 60 years of ministering his people: that ritual IS religion; that \\"From generation to generation, these rituals are how we remain...connected\\"; \\"it is far more comforting to believe God heard you and said no, than to think that nobody's out there\\"; and (my personal favorite) the meaning of happiness is to \\"be satisfied,\\" \\"be grateful.\\"During this time, Albom met another man of faith, Henry Covington. Henry is the pastor at the \\"I Am My Brother's Keeper\\" ministry in Detroit, Michigan, a poverty-stricken church and shelter that ministers to the homeless and downtrodden. His path to his congregation and service couldn't have been more different from Rabbi Lewis's. Henry was a drug dealer, a criminal who one night found himself hiding behind a bush, holding a gun, fearing for his life (and that of his family) and praying to God to let him make it through the night. And when he did, Henry committed his life to helping others. He helped Albom get over his own prejudices and skepticism, and he shared his gems of faith: \\"You are not your past\\" --- words Henry knew all too well to be true.    These two men --- so different in their experiences, their upbringing and their religions --- shared the common threads of faith and hope. And their convictions, their love, and even their senses of humor remind Albom of what it means to be \\"in love with hope.\\" His note at the end offers that his book is a \\"hope that all faiths can find something universal in (this) story.\\" Albom writes, as he always does, with a loving hand, revealing great intimacies that touch the heart. Like TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE, HAVE A LITTLE FAITH reminds us that, despite our differences, we are all human beings experiencing life, love, hatred and death; with any luck in our lifetimes, we will \\"be satisfied,\\" \\"be grateful.\\"       --- Reviewed by Roberta O'Hara
B002JM1VJG|5.0|This collection is the best collection you can ever have for true madonna fans.  I ordred this and got it in and I couldnt believe how long it has been since I saw all the old classic videos.  There are some on there that I had never even seen before and it excited me!  Miles Away is a New one and it is recorded live in concert and it is an awesome song and an amazing video.  I highly recommend this collection for all those die hard madonna fans out there Like myself.  You won't be disappointed because I was totally amazed!
B002KLAL4W|4.0|Well, I personally ranked this album 4 stars but would give it 3.5 if I could rank in halves on Amazon. I don't believe PJ's capable of releasing a 'bad' album, especially when compared to modern, inexperienced peers from flash-in-the-pan bands to ones that've been around a while but still release mediocre or even garbage albums. Backspacer doesn't rank amongst them by any means but leaves something to be desired both musically and in length.   The songs mentioned as experimental per another reviewer are really incredible songs that weren't as 'accessible' but completely turn my head almost every listen (You Are, Tremor Christ, Sleight of Hand...amazing). There isn't a single song on this CD quite up to that ranking, the best all-around track to me being Unthought Known, which has an emotional, crescendo build, appropriate lyrics and music to carry me to a good place when listening to it. The other good ones are Ed's solo songs, which, let's face it, aren't really even Pearl Jam tunes, they're his, played on a PJ record. I don't really mind that (he's done it before, ala Soon Forget, etc.) but the fact remains that there's nothing amazingly 'new' here. I hear a lot of their influences so strongly that at times I wonder if I'm even hearing Pearl Jam, which only the acoustic numbers settle my memory of who's singing as Ed's voice cuts through on those tunes, sounding like himself, not an 'influence.' Otherwise, it's a Ramones or Fugazi or Dead Boys album (none of which I care much for) with better musical & rhythmic content. The new-wave/punk combo influence is simply over the top on this record, to me. I LOVE Pearl Jam, so this is a bit hard to admit (10C member for 10 years, seen'em 6 times in that span live and they blow me away every time).   I will say, in opposition to some reviews I've scanned, that I really, really dig their self-titled album. It's an instant classic to me with tracks like Life Wasted, Parachutes, Severed Hand, Gone and Inside Job. Those songsreally make for a great listen, spin after spin to me, and in somewhat of a contrast, I really like tracks like Spin The Black Circle too, but there's only so much of that I would stand to hear all put onto one album (which they didn't really on Backspacer, just sayin').     I must say too, that I'm really kinda sick of the ocean/waves rhetoric that continues in a song on literally nearly every album. Ed, we get it...you surf. You like ocean water. Don't we all. I mean, (and I love some of these songs, don't get me wrong) c'mon, Oceans, Release, Tremor Christ (smallest oceans still get...), Push Me Pull Me, Evacuation, Insignificance, Love Boat Captain (duh), I Am Mine, You Are, Green Disease, 1/2 full, Big Wave, Marker In The Sand, World Wide Suicide, Parachutes, Amongst The Waves...I'm serious, look at the lyrics...it's like the never-ending theme! I'm sure there's more in Backspacer, just ran out of time to look.     Anyway, I just don't find anything 'new' here outside of Ed's tracks, 1 of which is so similar to a riff from Into The Wild that it might as well be from that soundtrack (which was very solid). I will say that I like the more positive lyrics of the last 2 albums (not that they're all that way & not that I mind the opposite) but the rest of it's a bit flat. I really hope that since they released the shortest album of their career but sounded like they had a good time in the studio that they'll come out with a mind-blowing album in under 2 years instead of the 3-to-nearly-4-year wait that became the norm after Binaural. I also just heard 8 out of 11 songs from Backspacer performed live in person & it didn't really add any excitement to the songs...they just sound like they're straight off the album & took up a bit too much of the setlist...I'll save that review for a different place.  If you don't get the sea turtle reference, well, I've got six letters for you G O O G L E =)
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|While I enjoyed the Masonic history, I closed this book never having even a smidgeon of feeling for the characters. I simply never cared that Peter Solomon had his \\"blank blanked blank\\" (Don't want to spoil.) Katherine was cardboard to me. The two characters who stood out the most had the shortest appearances, the lab helper and the hacker. They seemed real. Even the bad buy - I felt a bit sorry for him based on why he turned out the way he did. (Can I be LESS spoilish?)  I read books for characters - and no one in The Symbol touched me at all.<br /><br />Also, it was too darn long. I got tired of explanations. And the closed spaces in which Langdon's claustrophobia was tested. He sailed through every one of them, so I don't think he's actually claustrophobic, right?<br /><br />I just finished \\"The Doomsday Key\\" and it was a similar thriller - but the reason for the thrill was excellent and the characters were fleshed out.  Check it out.<br /><br />I read The Symbol in an old fashioned hardcover. Thank God. I'd have broken my page turning finger on my Kindle as I sped through the pages.
B002K0WBY6|4.0|There are two deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Anne Fletcher and writer Peter Chiarelli. There is a nice scene with Andrew's parents (Nelson and Steenburgen). We also see Margaret and Andrew getting a little more comfortable with each other. They are nice enough scenes but not essential and one can see why they were cut.<br /><br />There is an alternate ending with optional commentary. Fletcher and Chiarelli talk about why they didn't use this ending and another one that they didn't use as well. The humour in this scene is much broader than the rest of the film and seems out of place.<br /><br />\\"Set Antics: Outtakes and Other Absurdities from The Proposal\\" is a montage of the cast goofing around on set. It looks like they had a lot of fun making this film.<br /><br />Finally, there is an audio commentary by Fletcher and Chiarelli. They start off explaining the dichotomy between the two main characters. Fletcher says that Bullock loved the screenplay and gave Chiarelli all kinds of notes to make her character nastier. He talks about the mechanics of the story while she talks about the challenge of working on location. This is a fairly decent track by two people clearly proud of their film.
0385504225|3.0|I have read four of Dan Browns books and this one was a particularly hard read for me.  The set-up of the characters was unterminably long and I still don't really understand the ending at all.  DeVinci is still my favorite.
1416594787|2.0|It has been a couple of years since Richard Dawkins' last major work, The God Delusion. That book was a long-time fixture on the bestseller lists and served to establish Dawkins as the foremost spokesman for the New Atheists. Dawkins has long had two related emphases in his writing and speaking: the non-existence of God and the evidence in nature that evolution is responsible for all that exists. Where The God Delusion emphasized the former, his latest book, The Greatest Show on Earth, emphasizes the latter. It is primarily a counter-attack to advocates of Intelligent Design, and represents Dawkins' attempt to provide natural evidence for evolution. He says simply, \\"Evolution is a fact, and this book will demonstrate it.\\"<br /><br />It will not surprise you to hear that I was not convinced by Dawkins' evidences for evolution. I will not provide a rebuttal of those evidences here since I know that others who are more qualified than I am will do just that. Instead, in just a few paragraphs, let me share a few of my thoughts on this book and what I consider its more prominent flaws.<br /><br />Overall, there is a thread of arrogance in many of Dawkins' arguments. One the one hand Dawkins wants to show how science continues to make vast and important discoveries; he wants to show that science is living and always advancing, disproving old theses in favor of new ones. On the other hand he wants to act as if all we know about evolution we know for certain. So when we see that the retina in the human eye has the appearance of being installed backwards, we can therefore state with certainty that this is the case and that it is the result of a mutation that was overcome by fortuitous adaptations in the human brain. In other words, the human eye is a mistake. But how are we to know that an advance in science, two years from now, will not show that this is no accident but is just that way it has to be--or, to borrow from the world of software, that it is a feature instead of a bug. He relies on science to prove what is absolutely true or false, never pointing out how often science has been wrong in the past and how often a new advance overshadows or disproves an old one. The history of science gives me little confidence that, in the end, he will be proven correct even with an issue as simple as the human eye.<br /><br />Dawkins holds up the invariability of DNA code across all living creatures as evidence of shared ancestry (since the genetic code is shared across all living things--it is what is written in the code, not the code itself, that distinguishes one creature from another). But when I look at the same thing, I see that it points in the opposite direction. I see it, quite obviously, as evidence of a common artist. If I look at two paintings and see that they bear a great degree of similarity to one another, that they feature similar scenes and a similar brand of realism or abstraction, I do not assume that one painting evolved from the other or that together they evolved from a common ancestor; instead, I assume that they have come from the hand, the brush, of the same artist. I can grant that there is a sense in which man is related to ape and aardvark--we share a common designer. The fact that my DNA resembles that of any other living creature simply reinforces this fact. Believing in Creation does not demand that we suppose God did not reuse any parts or that every creature has to be entirely different from every other creature. One who believes in God as Creator can affirm that he is the designer and that he based all living things on common elements.<br /><br />One thing I noted often in the pages of The Greatest Show on Earth is that it is often difficult to know where fact ends and speculation begins. When Dawkins says that a kind of beetle has, over evolutionary time, evolved to resemble the ant it preys upon, do we know this is the case, or is Dawkins simply filling in what he considers a logical hole? Can he prove thatthis beetle began looking like something other than it is now using the same scientific rigor he demands of Creationists? Or is this just speculation? In this book he rarely distinguishes between the two. Needless to say, this leads to a fair bit of potential confusion.<br /><br />There is a deep and obvious irony in Dawkins' constant use of words of agency. In his worldview there is, at least in nature and in the universe, no planning, no design, no invention, no creation, no purpose. Everything has come to be through a long process of chance. Yet throughout the book he constantly softens this harsh reality by borrowing the words of agency and purpose. Why? Could it be that the world just too hard to contemplate without injecting some kind of higher purpose into it? But there is more. Very often he turns to examples or metaphors to explain what he is trying to communicate and, again, almost invariably these examples depend on some kind of agency. So, for example, he will discuss how there came to be so many varied breeds of dog, each descended from the wolf. This may be an evidence of evolution, but if so, it evidences a designer who made the decisions about which breed would have long legs and which would have short ones, which would have big ears and which would have small ones. It was human agency that shaped each of these breeds of dog! How can this then stand as an example of the agent-less, impersonal forces of nature? Again and again he falls into this trap.<br /><br />All this caused me to reflect on how cold, how stark the world would be without some kind of agency. A scientist can conjure up in his mind ways of describing the world without God, but he has a lot more trouble explaining it. Design seems to scream for a designer, elegance for agency. Even Dawkins cannot deny that the world gives the appearance of design; so his task is to prove that the most obvious explanation is not the correct one. I would challenge Dawkins in his future books not to use this cop out, not to say photosynthesis was \\"invented\\" by bacteria more than a million years ago. This is an unfair condescension that perhaps just proves that he cannot maintain his line of reasoning with any kind of consistency. Always he denies a designer, yet so often he perhaps-inadvertently invokes one.<br /><br />In this book I see the importance of what we can call worldview--the way each of us understands the world, the way each of us interprets all of life. Dawkins' worldview demands that there is no God and that everything came to be without the assistance or oversight of a designer. Not surprisingly, then, everywhere he looks he sees evidence to support his presuppositions, just as a Creationist looks to Creation and sees evidence of God. If I go out hunting for bigfoot, convinced of his existence, I will inevitably find evidence to support my theory. I will find vague footprints and half-eaten meals, each of which will prove to me that I am hot on bigfoot's trail. My presuppositions shape my conclusions. So this book shows me again that it is impossible, or near-impossible, to overcome our worldviews.<br /><br />This book shows that Dawkins is still angry, still shocked that anyone could be so hopelessly confused as to believe in God and to doubt naturalistic evolution. In fact, he refers to such people as \\"history-deniers,\\" people who see the evidence, spit on it, and turn instead to their comfortable old deities. \\"No reputable scientist disputes it,\\" he says, but of course he would use circular logic to define a reputable scientist. He would never admit that a scientist could be reputable and deny evolution. Here we have the same old Dawkins. Sure he tries a new approach, but ultimately it is more of the same.<br /><br />Is there value in reading The Greatest Show on Earth?. I am inclined to think that there is, at least for some people. I find it useful to read books written from an opposing viewpoint since they provide a very natural \\"check\\" for me. They help me wrestle with not only what I believe but how I express what I believe. This book gave me a lot to think about in that regard. And, though Dawkins insisted that the unbiased reader will close the book convinced of the validity of evolution, this was not the case for me. Then again, does the unbiased reader even exist? We've already shown that Dawkins is far from unbiased himself.this cop out, not to say photosynthesis was \\"invented\\" by bacteria more than a million years ago.

B002ELM5HY|5.0|This is a melodic and beautifully produced record with echoes of the sixties and seventies in it; if you are a hard core eighties Dire Straits music fan this might be too low key, but it is a beautiful progression of the work Knopfler began in Sailing to Philadelphia.  That album was less consistent and satisfying than Get Lucky, which really holds together as a listening experience from beginning to end (not that anyone listens to anything that way anymore).  It's like his music has moved from the streets and into an almost empty pub, where there is plenty of action but it now farther beneath the surface.
0385504225|2.0|There is a point in all of Dan Brown's books when I get so disgusted that I throw the book in the corner and go on to something else.  It's usually where Brown totally misunderstands science and includes a whopper of a goof (creating anti-matter from thin air as an energy source in A&D), or when I hear that he really believes the conspiracy theory ideas in DaVinci.  That's where I am now in Lost Symbol.  Someone has just claimed that thoughts have mass and when several people are thinking the same thoughts, the mass adds up.  And I don't doubt that Brown believes all this.  In his earlier books, I managed to ignore things like this and go back and finish the books, but I don't think I'll make it through this one.  Thank goodness for Kindle.    I loved Harry Potter because even though I don't believe in wizards and dragons, J.K. Rowling didn't say she did.  If Rowling had said the whole story was true, I would never have made it through the Sorcerer's Stone.    --- three weeks later ---    Well, I finished it.  The suspense pulls it along pretty well and you wonder how it could ever fulfill all it promises.  Well it doesn't.  It totally cops out in the ending with a long religious lecture based, supposedly, on \\"scientific\\" proof.  Still two stars.  One for the exciting decoding of the pyramid and one for the page-turning suspense in parts of the book.  But that's all I can give it.

0446604844|4.0|I am surprised that not more of his books have been put to film because Baldacci is a master of dialogue. I imagine that it may be due to the fact that \\"Absolute Power\\" was so badly mangled as a film and by the Clint Eastwood no less.<br /><br /> I put down Philip Margolin's \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and opened this book up trying to catch up on some novels that were lying around.  I rarely don't finish a book but Margolin's dialogue was so terrible that I just could not finish \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" even though the plot was semi interesting.  So Baldacci seemed like a breath of fresh air.  The criticisms about the plot implausability from many other reviewers is somewhat true, but it is well crafted and reads well because his characters come alive with their always spot on dialogue.  A lot of the internet dot com intrigue seems a bit dated already, but it still is an excellent page turner.  Highly Recommended.

0385504225|3.0|3 years in the making The Lost Symbol is probably the years most anticipated book. After the Sucess of The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, most of us were probably ready for a new Langdon adventure. I know I was. I finally grabbed my copy and I was really excited to read it, but shortly after I began wondering why. While the book starts off with Dan Brown's usual fast paced story telling. I feel as though the 3 years it took to write this book, really were a waste. I feel like a majority of this book was written over a weekend, and that Brown just borrowed from the already successful well he has been pulling from. While I wasn't expecting something entirely new Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code were each unique and compelling, The Lost Symbol is just more of the same. Robert Langdon recieves a phone call from a friend, flies to D.C., and then poof get's drawn into the middle of a conspiracy. While I knew this formula would be present, I was hoping for the same unpredictable and crazy adventures Langdon always seems to go through. While for the most part it is there, the sad part is that with each revelation and question answered you are left feeling, jipped. Nothing is really shocking, or suprising for that matter. The big twist towards the end you know about 4 chapters before it actually happens leaving you feeling let down. Then the final \\"big\\" revelation which the entire story is surronded, is the biggest jip in history. I won't spoil it but when something goes from being one thing, to another thing, to another, to let down it kind of sucks.<br /><br />Brown introduces readers to the same cast of characters he always does. An old friend, a woman who has stake in what Langdon is chasing, a villian who while mysterious (is pretty much straight from the Da Vinci Code, only with tattoo's and less christian), mysterious people helping Langdon along the way, and the shady one's who seem to have no allegiance, but are somehow tied into the story. Langdon goes through the same trials of wracking his brain to figure out symbols and codes to eventually lead to something that if man possessed would \\"tear the fabric of existence!\\" The chapters like usual are short and push the reader to try and get a few more chapters under their belt before closing the book. But, where Brown seems to fall way short in this book, is an overuse of information, and constant repeating. I feel like for every 5 lines of dialogue there about 4 paragraphs about the history of whatever the hell they are talking about. Yes, it's always helpful to know little things, but when a majority of your book ready like a history book it kind of steers you away from the action and suspense. Alot of informatin is common knowledge to anyone who watches the history channel, or has heard the word Freemason. But, Brown insists on leading us around like we are 3 and telling us in detail everything there is to know about everything he talks about. While it shows that he did his research, and maybe that he is trying to avoid alot of the fire he has taken in the past, but it still just really breaks it up too much to follow sometimes. I found myself skimming to get back to the story at times.<br /><br />The villian in this book really isn't likeable or warranting of sympathy what-so-ever. Usually there is something in them, that is redeeming, this guy is just an idiot. Apparently he is also super-human because he survives some of the most retarded things, and is able to take out anyone and everyone relatively quickly. Also I kind of got the feeling that everyone in the book was really really gullible. *SPOILER ALERT* Langdon never talks to his friend before bringing something of great value to D.C., everyone seems to notice the make-up that the villian wears but trusts him anyways, everyone let's this man into anything, even knowing that her brother never texts and doesn't know how she still accepts the fact that all of the sudden he figured it out, after the big deciphering they just up and believe that everything has been solved by a security person, and even upon pulling into the driveway with a CIA agent no one realizes that there isn't a single police car.** It just really got to me all these stupid avoidable mistakes. Langdon is supposed to be a professor and Katherine (the friends sister, and langdons leading woman for this book) a scientists and they made stupid mistakes the whole book.<br /><br />Where Brown could have completely redeemed everything was the ending. With everything calming down and full decipher it could have been the ultimate revelation in the book. Instead we get a shot of religion and the end. This makes me really sad. Usually when I reach the end of a Dan Brown book I feel really satisfied, even with the earlier ones (Deception Point and Digital Fortress were excellent) I felt good about reading them. They kept pace, gave you crucial info but always kept things moving. I feel like after all of the success and two movies under his belt, he has gotten comfortable. That is a bad thing in this case. If he had lost alot of the un-necessary history lesson's the book could have been shorter and read better. The ending definitely could have been a ton better. All in all the book wasn't terrible, but it definitely doesn't live up to his previous efforts. If this was his first novel it would have been forgiveable. But after everything I'm really not all that excited for another Langdon adventure. If you have some spare time, or like his previous works, or just masons, by all means atleast give it a read. But if you are looking for the next Da Vinci Code this isn't it.<br /><br />**Spoiler Alert** was I the only one who was really frustrated by the deprivation chamber, where Brown makes you think that langdon is dead?

0385504225|2.0|Obviously Dan Brown will never be able to top  [[ASIN:1400079179 The Da Vinci Code]] but I was not expecting him to.  I wanted a good story with well researched history and symbology mixed in.  Well this book had this but they were not integrated well at all.  I am willing to bet that someone was hired to come up with the plot while Dan Brown plugged in the symbology.  The history about DC and the freemasons is interesting, but the story is truly bad.  Of course there is always some suspension of disbelief, but on several occasions I said out load \\"oh come on,\\" because it was so ridiculous. Also its written to be turned into a movie.  The 3 page chapters reminded me of the commercial breaks on Lost.  This book was all about making money.  Its mildly entertaining and the history is mildly interesting, but beyond that there is not much there.

B002MW50KO|4.0|I'll admit, when I heard that Bob Dylan was releasing an album of Christmas music, I was waiting for the punch line.  Surely, it had to be a joke, didn't it?  It wasn't.  My next thought was, will I actually buy it? (Not my usual thought when I hear that Dylan has new music coming out.)  Finally, I thought, \\"Yeah.  I'll buy it.  I'll listen to it once, maybe play it on Christmas, and that'll be it.    Boy, was I wrong!    I've already played this one through several times.  It is great!  The musicians play superbly, and Bob seems to be totally engaged in the music.  He sounds downright spritely on \\"Here Comes Santa Claus,\\" \\"Winter Wonderland,\\" and, especially, on \\"Must Be Santa.\\"  He delivers his versions of traditional Christmas hymns with reverence but without sounding dry.  Once again producing himself under his \\"Jack Frost\\" pseudonym, this may actually be his best self-production yet.  And, at 68, Bob keeps pushing that craggy voice of his to hit some high notes.  I find that in itself invigorating.    \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" is a very good Christmas album, and a mighty fine addition to the formidable Dylan catalog.  I'm no longer concerned that I'll only play it once; now, I'm concerned that I'll wear it out before Christmas.

B000001GAM|5.0|And I've heard almost all the modern recordings of it. Giulini is simply a great Brucknerian. He's actually much better than Jochum. Too bad he didn't record an entire Bruckner cycle. Unlike Jochum, Giulini has a better sense of the inner dynamics of the symphony and also how to navigate through the tempi. The \\"Scherzo\\" movement, which for me is a movement that must be played at a certain tempo, is one of the best I've heard. What really got my heart pounding was the 3rd movement \\"Adagio. Langsam, feierlich,\\" which is really astounding. I love the way Giulini handles this movement, especially when he signals those huge brass chorales. It sent chills down my spine!<br /><br />I simply cannot compare this recording with any other 9th recording, because it's, to it put simply, in a class of its' own. The playing from the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra is exemplary. Those brass chorales are really a sonic marvel that Bruckner wrote and they come through loud and clear in this recording. The audio quality is also very good.<br /><br />There's absolutely nothing I can find wrong here. It is magnificient! 5+ stars

I think it is a great series of books not only for the children but for their parents as well.

Greg is actually a very smart kid and the simple drawings are just perfect for demonstrating humour.

I am a huge Beatles fan, but I can't see putting down $40 extra for a box to store them all.  When the presale price was $170 for the set, it made sense, but now it's just ridiculous.

I loved the books when I read them and am happy to see they have been so well adapted (at least the first one, which is all I've seen so far).  The Dark Passenger seems to get short shrift in this first series, and that left me without much of an insight into what Dexter really thinks.  I know his narration spells everything out, but I just wasn't convinced without some more description of what was in the Dark Passenger's mind.  Still, I enjoyed this thoroughly.  Sgt. Doakes is perfect!
B001IF252M|4.0|I had to get this to be able to switch from my new macmini to my pc using my old KVM switch with only has a vga connector. It works fine for this most of the time. Sometimes though you have to mess with it to get it to work correctly. Like I just installed Windows 7 via bootcamp and upon rebooting got a black screen. Only way to fix this was to connect the mini-dvi video connector that orignally came with the mac first and then windows somehow saw the displayport or installed the displayport drivers and I was able to use it with Windows 7. As far as macosx goes you have to hit detect displays to get the maximum resolution for your monitor to show up otherwise you will be stuck with very low resolutions. If bought it recently it should already have the most recent bios update that some people mentioned so no need to update although if you are having trouble this may be worth checking. I'm taking off 1 star for the design of the end of the connector that makes it hard for alot of vga connectors to stay flush since the plastic gets in the way. If you do get it to work you won't be able to tell the difference from dvi since it the display will look just as good and sharp. May have problems running hi-def content also though.
1400063515|5.0|This book by the philosopher-stock trader is an impressive work that, for a non-specialist, would likely require several close reads in order to absorb everything from the book.  Needless to say, and by the position this book currently holds in the top 300 best-selling books on Amazon, I think this will be one to hold up to scrutiny for years to come.  I first heard this book referenced in a presentation on the value of outside thinking in wargaming in military settings.  The book was new at the time, but it was already obvious it was going to have longstanding influence on policy planners and decision makers.      I highly recommend this book.

1906694176|5.0|I tracked down a copy of the Swedish original because I couldn't wait for the English version after reading the first two.  I read Norwegian and found myself able to get through this and wasn't disappointed.  Complex, very political and illuminating, the only complaint I have is one common to crime novels.  The ending was just a bit too tidy, too many strands of plot just suddenly came together.  Otherwise, a very dense and well-written book, all 703 pages of it.  The two earlier novels, which I read in English, seem very true to the Swedish and were very well translated.

GO OUT AND RENT IT IF YOUR NOT SURE OR WAIT FOR IT TO BE ON TV!!!!
0316044938|4.0|I have had this book on my shelf for years. I am not sure why I did not pick it up before now except for no time to read and when I did find those few precious moments, I always seemed another book ended up in my hands. With the release of the movie, the urging of my daughter and the extra reading time, I was able to give this book some attention.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.  The narrator is Susie Salmon speaking as she wanders around heaven looking down upon her family, friends and her murderer. The description of her murder was so violent, heartbreaking and frightening, I was worried the rest of the book may be full of shocking moments designed to grab the readers attention.  Thankfully, the rest of Susie's story is actually calm and beautifully written.<br /><br />Susie's heaven includes a glorified version of the high school she dreamed of ruling (without classes of course), a lovely home shared with another child, dances with her grandfather and a gazebo from which she sits and watches as her family and friends attempt to deal with her death.<br /><br />Ms. Sebold's The Lovely Bones is an examination into the grieving process of those left behind. Especially when the daughter/sister/friend/practical stranger is taken in such a disturbing and abrupt manner. How each person struggles to move on is written in a quietly elegant manner. The father who turns completely inward, the mother who runs away, the sister who will not admit her agony and the friends and strangers who begin to look at themselves and others around them in a different light.<br /><br />The book does include some supernatural elements as Susie attempts to reach out and point everyone in the direction of her killer as he is right under there very noses.  I enjoyed this aspect of the story. There are so many unknowns in this world as to completely discredit the idea that our departed loved ones may be watching over us and cringing when they can see we are about to fall (physically or spiritually). There was a section of the book towards the end that I felt did not match the tone of the story. It was actually quite surprising to me and I felt the actions of Susie were out of character. This small bit, by no means, spoiled my enjoyment of the book, it just took away from the flow of my reading.<br /><br />I am actually thinking of seeing the movie adaptation due out in December. I may wait for the DVD release as I would not want my blubbering to bother other theater patrons. Yes, I cried and more than once. Possibly this is because I found it very hard to not see my own daughter in Susie and this level of loss is not something any parent should have to endure. I am not sure I would have the strength.e book towards the end that I felt did not match the tone of the story.

B00006FMAW|4.0|A nice try as a commentary on our society, the rich versus everybody else, but compromised in some areas. For a more compelling look at the human condition in the sci-fi format, try another sleeper, not yet on DVD(too new), \\"District 9\\". It makes  the later \\"Star Trek\\" genre look as if it has nothing to say. The social commentary is superb.

Maybe they wanted it just right. It was all worth it.

B000WGZGNS|3.0|No doubt, Miss B put on a heck of a show, but about 60 minutes in, I was done.  It seems she tried to sing every hit she ever made and I grew tired of watching and listening to her.  I think she should have left out the Destiny's Child material and the DC reunion.  She's got boundless energy and visually she is quite stunning.  The show was entertaining for the most part and her costumes were very pretty, except the one where she has the jewels on her bottom.  I guess the editing was top notch as well, because I never heard her miss a note or lose her breath.  There's one song, something about her flaws, that I really liked.  I'd never heard that one before.  The audience there for the taping experienced a real treat, but watching this 2 hour spectacle proved to be a chore for me.  I won't likely watch this again.

0671876813|2.0|Of the five Honor Harrington books I've read so far, this is the only one that had me skipping pages. Weber moves away from what made the series so enjoyable -- the military angle -- and the result is a book that's 80 percent politics, with only a smattering of the fleet-dueling, ship-maneuvering fun.<br /><br />Worse, there are seemingly endless passages of characters' introspection. Yes, it rounds them out to see their thought processes, but after 10 or 12 paragraphs that serve as either overdone exposition or needless history lesson, it's a bit tiresome.<br /><br />Imagine something like this:<br /><br />\\"Smith looked out the window at the fields below -- fields his father had inherited after the first civil war, which saw more than 80 percent of the farms in the region destroyed. His father, himself the child of a military man, had pledged never to let that happen again. And because his father was a Jonesian by birth, that promise also carried on to the younger Smith. Jonesians were known galaxy-wide for their unwavering resolve, a fact that had served Smith well. It helped, of course, that he had been trained at the Johnson Academy, known for instilling the virtues of both economic sense and military prowess in its students. But because those students often....\\"<br /><br />You get the idea. Now imagine it going on and on for several pages. So much for \\"show them, don't tell them.\\"<br /><br />There are other issues with \\"Flag in Exile.\\" Ironically, while such overzealous inner dialog gives supporting characters more depth, Honor Harrington is in danger of becoming a caricature. She's too perfect. Her officers are all incredible. Her staff is top of the line. Her crew is wonderful. Her plans always work. In earlier books we learned she's a perfect shot -- possibly one of the best there is. Her treecat, Nimitz, is the only one known to develop a two-way empathic link. In this book, [SPOILER WARNING!!!] despite less than a year's training, she's able to defeat one of the best sword fighters on the planet in a fraction of second while bruised, broken, and exhausted. [END SPOILER]<br /><br />To say believability is stretched is an understatement.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the first four books in the series, and will be starting the sixth soon.

B000002GFC|5.0|For those of you that grew up in the 60's, the Best of Cream should be part of your collection.  Even though they were short lived, their music and legacy have left a long lasting impact on a generation of people.  Who could forget the two dynamic sounds of Jack Bruce and Eric Clapton singing lead, or the hypnotic beat of Ginger Baker and his double bass.  This was a time when things were simple and this music made it more memorable.
B00064X3BI|3.0|Clapton's Slowhand is a great album -  this release is a Hybrid SACD disc, encoded in both Surround and Stereo formats.    The surround format is 5.1 encoded. The recording sounds bigger with more air, however this was not as appealing to me. In my opinion, music suddenly lost dynamics, and instead sounded like I had engaged the \\"Arena\\" or \\"Church\\" DSP modes of the surround receiver. This has never been appealing to me, and I dont believe that I understand the value of encoding such albums in 5.1 mixes.    The stereo SACD mix sounds great though: better resolution and better imaging throughout the disc.     Should you purchase the disc? Well - there have been great SACDs released so far. SACD are a dying breed and I am buying as many as I can lay my hands on.   However this does not classify as an essential purchase in my opinion.
B001GCUO16|1.0|I SWEAR I HAVE TRIED TO PUT THIS MOVIE OUT OF MY HEAD. FOR A HARDCORE FOLLOWER OF THE X-MEN COMIC BOOK, CARTOON SERIES, ACTION FIGURES, ETC. ETC. THIS IS BY FAR OVER HYPED, OVER RATED, AND JUST PLAIN HORRIBLE FILM. BORING, DEAD PLOT, NEVER EXCITING, NO SURPRISE, NO NOTHING. THIS FILM IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH TERMINATOR WITH CHRISTIAN BALE. THAT MOVIE SUCKED AS WELL BUT OVER HYPED BECAUSE ITS THE GREAT CHRISTIAN BALE. IT DIDN'T WORK AND NEITHER DID WOLVERINE. JUST TERRIBLE. WAIT FOR THIS TO COME OUT ON CABLE. IT SHOULD BE 9.99 FOR THE BLU-RAY COPY. SORRY.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|Great release in Blu Ray format.   The picture transfer is fantastic, all the wrinkles on Walter's face are seen clearly. The dark scenes are well rendered and full of detail.   The sound although clean is not very vibrant or dynamic, and limited to Dolby Digital (Example, Battlestar Galactica has been encoded with DTS-MA).    I like the Blu Ray Packaging for boxed sets - the DVD packaging for the Boxed sets before, like X-Files, was too thick and too weak. There is also a holographic print that comes with this set.    Others have reviewed the quality of this show in greater detail -I believe that the show is still in its infancy, and needs more maturity with regards to the plot lines and the dynamic between the shows principal characters.  Peter, for example: what exactly does he do in the show?    The surprise entry of Leonard Nimoy in the show was an absolute clincher for me, and I will stay hooked until Nimoy keeps reprising his character.
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|The item is an excellent work from a-ha and team. It was based in the first sound of a-ha in the 80's whitch is come back very well adapted for the current music withou losing the a-ha's characteristic. I usually say 'this is one more excellent work of a-ha'
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. If I ever see it on TV, I have to watch it, no matter what point I am starting from. I'm not usually a big Russell Crowe fan, but I thought he was incredible in this movie. I totally bought into his character. This is a great movie to watch if you aren't feeling particularly motivated with your life. Watching Maximus journey is also really inspiring.    One thing I never understand was how he got the nickname \\"Spaniard.\\" Was there something about his appearance that made him look Spanish or I was missing something?     Well, regardless, I love this movie and if by some bizarre happenstance, you haven't seen this film yet, please stop wasting your life and go watch it!

I think that everyone should read it, not based on 1 star reviews from biased individuals, but create your own opinion.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|The Beatles Master works altogether in a box.  The music speaks for itself, and for a Generation.  Nothing needs to be further discussed there, five stars by any sane person's measure of achievement. The re-mastered versions contained here within are a treasure to behold. Macca's bass lines are thick and nimble, free of the rumble associated with older recordings, he and Ringo form a beautiful rhythm section unparalleled in rock music; you can clearly hear Ringo's deft playing,  that is noticeably punchier, especially in the later albums like the \\"White Album\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\". The box taken as a whole is particularly generous to the Bass and Drums, there is a deeper spacious sound that emulates from the speakers. The guitars pop with clarity and the vocals have an almost airy quality to them, absolutely gorgeous, presumably like they sounded in the studio. Going into this I suspected that the most improved albums would be the later ones, not necessarily so, \\"Please Please Me\\" is a major revelation, the rumble on \\"Do You Want to Know A Secret\\" has been eliminated and the vocals are pristine; it's great to have these first four officially released in Stereo. I also own the  Mono box and I can't make up my mind about the first 2 albums - Stereo or Mono, both have something going on for them, the mono sound more full, but there's no denying that the bottom end has been EQ'd on the STEREO sister versions to astonishing effect. The mid-period Beatles albums showcase John and George's Guitar (and sometimes Paul) that on songs like the tandem playing \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" have more authority and power. I particularly liked Sgt. Pepper's remaster, it has a drier sound to my ears and a much more commanding presence overall. Much has been said about whether these classics should have been remixed or not, I am firmly in the remixed camp, I believe that would have been the best way to go but to deny the breathtaking beauty and improvements here would be foolhardy.
1594481717|5.0|This is a great conversation-starter for anyone interested in education.  My favorite line is that we need to \\"educate children for their future, not our past.\\"  The world is changing and our education system needs to keep up.  Get ready to think with this book!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have not seen any TV, cable or broadcast, in 16 years, except going out to bars or over to friends' houses to watch things like the World Series and the presidential debates, or occasionally seeing some sitcom while visiting relatives. If I thought all TV were like True Blood, I'd subscribe to cable.     Our college-age daughter left the Season 1 DVD set with us when she back to school in September. We finally started watching Friday night, and had finished all 12 episodes by Monday. Sunday night we watched 5 episodes in a row. We probably would have watched them all at one sitting, but we have a 6-year old, and this is NC-17 stuff, so we could only watch after he went to bed.     The writing, acting, editing and visual style on True Blood are consistently brilliant. The first episode was a little off-putting. Vampires don't much interest me . I can't stand Anne Rice, haven't tried Twilight, and never even made it through the novel or original Bela Lugosi film of \\"Dracula.\\" My initial reaction was, \\"This just looks like an excuse for soft-core porn.\\" But, we stuck with it, and by the second episode, we were completely hooked. It's done old-fashioned cliff-hanger style, so at the end of each episode, you can't wait for the next one. The characters are well-developed, multi-faceted and engaging. Stephen Moyer's Bill is the sexiest screen character since Harrison Ford in \\"Witness.\\" The casting of Anna Paquin as Sookie perfectly enables the viewer to project himself or herself into the story: she's pretty and a fine actress, but down to earth enough that women can imagine being her and men can imagine being with her. Someone like Angelina Jolie would overwhelm the part of Sookie. The key supporting roles of Sam, Sookie's boss at Merlotte's Bar and Grill, Jason, Sookie's horny imbecile of a brother, Tara, Sookie's hard-case best friend, and Lafayette, Tara's hilarious cousin, are very well played, as are most of the minor and temporary characters. The extremely imaginative scripts are full of suspense, insight and humor, and clever if somewhat obvious political satire if you choose to take it that way. (For example, Sookie's brother Jason bears a startling physical resemblance to Bush II, and gets himself into all kinds of messes by not thinking above his belt.)  The editing is super-tight, with no scene going on too long, and yet no character or situation feeling like it has not been given a chance to develop fully. You can almost feel the swampy Louisiana nights, complete with biting mosquitoes.     So, suspend your disbelief, tuck the kids in bed, and get sucked into this intelligent, sexy, extraordinarily well-done Southern Gothic adult entertainment.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Okay - I LOVE this series and will extol it's virtues to anyone interested. However, I will attempt to hold back my fandom geek side and give as balanced a review as possible:    Firefly is a series that moves beyond the ordinary drivel that is shoved down our throats. Witty, engaging and entirely believable characters who face everyday problems outside of the major plot lines are the absolute foundation of this series. It could not have been done by any other cast. For anyone watching it for the first time, be sure to give the series a few episodes to form a solid opinion as the interactivity over time between characters is the essential component of this series.    However, there will be those out there who just don't like it for one reason or another. So, I would suggest that you rent before you buy just to be sure that you do indeed, LOVE it (like I do) before you blow your wad.

0385504225|2.0|Reading The Lost Symbol, or any other Dan Brown novel (yes, I'm guilty of reading them all) is essentially like buying an entire gallon tub of extra-butter popcorn for just yourself at the theater. It might taste good, but while eating it, you know it's really just a pile of buttered fat that's going to make you sad that you ate it later. Amazingly, Brown seems to craft his ridiculous tales using some ancient Freemason secret that compels you to finish the book. Trust me, no matter how bad it seems, you're going to keep reading it- this is Brown's greatest trick.<br /><br />My three main gripes with the book are:<br /><br />1. It's obviously aimed at the lowest common denominator of English literacy to maximize sales potential. If you want a taste for Brown's writing prowess, go to a used bookstore, pick up a copy of any Sweet Valley High book, and read a few pages. Brown's storytelling style is similar.<br /><br />2. The story is ridiculously implausible, with more Deux Ex Machina than you can shake a stick at. I'm serious, there's probably 5 or more, for both the protagonist and villain. Some are simply never explained.<br /><br />3. The characters are one-dimensional and clich&eacute;d. Langdon is Indiana Jones, but knows everything about history and mysticism. The Bad Guy (This should literally be his name) is evil for seemingly no other reason than to be evil. Also, his transformation from drug-addled prison inmate to a hyper-intelligent, bodybuilder-perfect supervillain is a bit of a stretch. The female interest in the story is rich, thin, super-smart and Langdon's age (shock!).<br /><br />I won't ruin the \\"twist\\", but suffice to say it's perhaps the most sadly clich&eacute;d twist in history, and does nothing for the story.<br /><br />The book will keep you busy on plane flights or as a brainless read before falling asleep, but keep that in mind before you purchase it.<br /><br />I'd wait until the inevitable movie, or until the book's in the bargain bin. 2 stars for Brown's amazing ability to make me keep reading through the pain.

B002N7P23I|2.0|After hearing this movie's title come up over and over again, often in the same breath as \\"Let the Right One In,\\" i expected A LOT more out of this.<br /><br />Let's start with the dub-overs...<br />The choices in voice actors for this were absolutely atrocious. At no point in time are you able to believe the voice is coming out of the person you are seeing. An old woman seems voiced-over by some woman in her forties, a twenty-year old the same. Granted, it kills the illusion while their mouth completely doesn't match the words either and keeps moving silently, but I'd have given some allowance for that. It would certainly be better if you spoke Spanish and could watch it in its original form, but even then, I don't see my rating going above 3 stars.<br /><br />As for the movie content itself, it is absolutely nowhere remotely close to the caliber of \\"Let the Right One In\\" - not at all. I suppose if you also enjoyed Blair Witch or other extremely low-quality movies that are not at all scary then perhaps this movie might be for you, but for anyone seeking a quality horror film that is not \\"out of the box,\\" not predictable or about a subject that has more than run its course, find something else. This movie does try with its Grudge-type \\"boo! it's a freaky little kid face\\" moments, but that is about the only time you might jump or anything (if you had been dozing off). The biggest suspense for me was waiting for the cute little girl \\"star\\" of the movie to get her white tank top wet so guys could see some \\"omg boobies!\\" (Yes, that's indicative of my perceptions of the quality of this film).<br /><br />The story idea was maybe alright, but could have been a million times better. The story part seemed an afterthought to the aforementioned \\"boo!\\" scenes.<br /><br />Honestly, I've seen better youtube video shorts.
0385504225|1.0|As many reviewers, I couldn't wait to seek my teeth into this book, especially after loving The DiVinci Code.  However, I have major problems with the book and beware, there are SPOILERS in this review.    First off, as many have said, the book is way too long and very poorly edited.  At the beginning, in Robert's classroom scene, one of his students declares something to be \\"awesome.\\"  Langdon rolls his eyes and wishes that the word could somehow be obliterated.  Then, several chapters later, as he is describing the pyramid, he actually says \\"awesome power.\\"  Also, when Katherine belives she is actually measuring the weight of a soul, was my biggest \\"are you kidding me.\\"  She \\"proved\\" that before someone died, he was one weight, but then after death, he was just this much lighter, proving that she weighed a soul.  Well, I am no physician, scientist,but when you die, all of your body fluid is released--wouldn't that be the reason for the change in weight.  That was RIDICULOUS!  As were many other things too numerous to name, although I was disappointed when Katherine didn't use her power of noetic science to get herself out of the wire and leather that bound her.  She also lost a lot of blood, but as soon as she was rescued, off she was bounding off to the next clue.  And I don't know about you, but if I was placed in a sensory deprivation tank, even for a minute, I would not have my wits about me to travel through DC in the middle of the night to solve a puzzle.  And Langdon was in that chamber for quite some time, but he was able to do this. Oh, and the---well, enough said.   I could go on for pages.  Ah, maybe it's just me, but I'm done with Dan Brown.
1932100660|5.0|This book has had a huge affect on me: on what I buy at the grocery store, on how I prepare food for our family. And, its made me notice how highly educated, intelligent, well-meaning people CHOOSE to eat foods that are unhealthy for us. I'm not talking about a piece of chocolate or indulging in dessert while out to dinner. I'm talking about eating processed, genetically engineered foods as our staples: putting things into our body that we simply don't know what they are because its easier, and it tastes good.<br /><br />This book woke me up to the fact that many of our diseases are in fact caused by us, caused by what we eat. There's no single person behind our food industry, no single CEO that is responsible so as long as Americans keep eating our burgers & fries, we'll continue to be fat & unhealthy. And disease ridden. It baffles me that we are such an educated country, yet we feed ourselves & our children foods we KNOW are bad for us.<br /><br />I grew up on a ranch where meat was part of every meal. We butchered animals each summer to stock our freezer for the coming year. We ate animals we raised & hunted, drank milk fresh from our cows. I have tremendous respect for people who tend to the land, and a fondness for those memories out in our pastures tending to animals. I also know a lot of people who have cancer. We always thought it was because our community is very tight knit, everyone knows everyone.  Now I wonder.<br /><br />It's daunting to consider changing our eating habits. I'm responsible for three children, what I serve on the table is what they are going to eat. It's scary to \\"figure out\\" how to eat healthy, to make that commitment, but this book is very convincing in saying that our bodies will react to what we put into our mouths. It's our choice.

0061537969|5.0|A friend suggested that I read this book and I am so glad I took his advice.  Narrated by Enzo, a very sage canine, this book has everything a good read should have:  humor, mystery, love, heart ache, villains, and a passionate pursuit.  It is fun, but is also provocative in its ability to make one think about life and what is truly important. It never gets soppy or melodramatic which could be easy for a book narrated by a car racing/television watching dog.  I bought a paperback, but have already sent it on it's way from husband to friends.  I will buy the hard cover so I can read it over, again, and again.  It is sure to become a movie, but I hope the producer and director are very sensitive and turn this lovely book into a sappy after school movie.
B000I2J6K0|4.0|I was a little skeptical when buying this dvd because I was looking for a prenatal fitness dvd that would challenge me (seems like most pregnancy videos don't) but wouldn't overwork me to the point of being really out of breath and putting my baby at risk. Let me start by saying that I'm currently 19 weeks, and for the first few months I rarely exercised at all...mostly walking if anything. Before getting pregnant I was fairly fit, ran occasionally for 2-3 miles, but was anything but regular about working out. I was really worried when I saw all of the reviews from ladies who said they were avid runners and yoga enthusiasts and were unable to complete the workout. I had no problem at all completing the entire workout, so please don't let that disuade you. I would say that anyone with a moderate to high level of fitness will be challenged in some area, which is exactly what you want. Beginners may be a little overwhelmed at first, but would probably get through it within a couple of weeks with the modifications that Erin makes. I loved the low-key setting and loved that she used furniture that I easily found within easy reach. (No special weights, steps, etc.) No cheesy workout music and no ungodly insane cheeriness ala Denise Austin. Erin is very down-to-earth and keeps her voice very calm and level. In short, love this dvd!
B0010X745K|1.0|Well, I had heard that this was a stupid movie with a horrible ending but did I listen?  Nooooo, I still had hopes for entertainment, and I bought it anyway.  What a waste of two hours.  I don't even know anyone I would GIVE this DVD to.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Delivery Prompt. DVD perfect condition. Amazon definitely has the BEST suppliers who always follow through expediently when orders are placed.  [[ASIN:B000AP04OM The Sound of Music (Two-Disc 40th Anniversary Special Edition)]]
0756405890|5.0|I had read this book's jacket while in the store, and was put off, and was torn in buying it even after reading some of these reviews.  But it was a dry spell with little new out, so I bought \\"The Name of the Wind\\"    I read 2 paragraphs into the first page, and was hooked.  The writing was -beautiful- .  The writer was so good in fact that his phrasing threatened to overshadow the plot itself.  I've easily a couple thousand sci-fi/fantasy books and this work outshines them all.    Others have reviewed the plot, so there is no point in doing so again.  I want to say this is a book for adults - not that it is gory, or has explicit sexual scenes (which it does not) but that the book isn't \\"you-know-who simple, who writes about dark elves\\".  You should ignore the impression you get from reading the back cover, and buy this book.
B002CVQAX6|5.0|Finally on blu ray, this movie looks better than ever. Scary, not really; a few jumps here and there, but this movie is more like a 'Shining' on the water; lots of cool visuals and a very nice surprise at the end. No Oscars, but the acting is solid, the twists are interesting, and it's over in 90 minutes. A great opening sequence sets the tone, and this movie just chugs right along from there. Sequel?<br /><br />Could have done without the toast to 'the sea', however.
B002GZQYMK|2.0|I know all Muse fans, including me, hate constant comparisons to Radiohead, so how about a contrast... Radiohead has never released an album that hasn't involved big changes from all previous records... Muse, while nowhere near as diverse in their catalog, still gave listeners a fresh output each album they released, and I consider every one of those records to be a big improvement on the previous one. This album, however, is deja vu throughout. And I know we all love when the multi-instrumentally-talented Matthew incorporates his beautiful piano skills into a song, but the piano-vocal moments in the second half of \\"Resistance\\" are the biggest examples of deja vu from previous performances.     I want to know why a band who already has a gigantic international fanbase wasn't able to take more chances on a record. Yes, these songs are all very listenable and do rock, but where's the Muse excitement when there's no \\"Holy cow, I've never rocked like that before\\"? Songs like \\"Map of the Problematique\\", \\"Hysteria\\", \\"Time is Running Out\\", and so many more really did give us that reaction. So, I challenge any fan of this album to point out what is new and fresh about this record. I'm very curious to know what I'm missing, if I am wrong at all about this.
1400064287|5.0|This book really strikes home & is applicable for people in a wide variety of professions.  The Heath brothers draw from diverse backgrounds in both business consulting & education.  The combination of their ideas is both compelling and entertaining, but most importantly, they teach us how to communicate more persuasively.  I won't summarize their SUCCESS formula for making ideas \\"stickier,\\" which other reviewers have covered well.  Other really original aspects of this book include that a really good idea doesn't have to be thought of ourselves.  One must, however, have the ability to distinguish a great idea when one sees it; to seperate the wheat from the chaff.<br /><br />Other innovative ideas raised in Made to Stick include \\"Commander's Intent\\" statements or CI, schemas & the power of using stories and proverbs.  This is one of the few books I have read that actually statistically backs up something we know intuitively but often have challenged: that people remember stories better than dry numbers and statistics.  The \\"Curse of Knowledge\\" is also a brilliant idea that clearly has been popularized through this book; it essentially is about the difficulty people have in communicating because if one has knowledge in a certain subject, it is hard to remember what it was like before having this understanding.  This makes it hard to put oneself in other's shoes & communicate effectively.<br /><br />As someone in PR & marketing, their advice on how to determine what a sticky story lead is also invaluable.  Their concrete examples ranging from Subway Sandwiches' Jared weight loss campaign to the effectiveness of the \\"Don't Mess with Texas\\" advertising in actually reducing littering in that state truly differentiate this book from others.  The Heath brothers are able to show how their ideas can be put into practice and they come back repeatedly to ideas presented previously in the book, making the principles they raise easily remembered.  Finally, \\"Idea Clinics\\" sections of the book, which they say can be skipped, are actually a fantastic way to make everything more concrete and applicable through the extremely memorable examples provided.  A fantastic, easily digested and well researched read!which they say can be skipped, are actually a fantastic way to make everything more concrete and applicable through the extremely memorable examples provided.

B00000AF95|3.0|With Vinnie Vincent out of the band, Gene Simmons on partial leave to make movies and Paul Stanley left to helm the production board, KISS set out to discover if they could capitalize on the newly minted unmasked success of [[ASIN:B00000AF94 Lick It Up]]. While \\"Animalize\\" went double platinum, it's pretty much a middling KISS album, and the beginning of an 80's phase of pop-metal records that culminated in [[ASIN:B000001FQQ Hot in the Shade]].<br /><br />There are a few strong songs here, especially the hit \\"Heaven's On Fire.\\" New guitarist Mark St John brought a technical proficiency Frehley never had, and his leads on the album are great shredder material. (It was also his only Kiss album, a rare disease forced him to stop playing before the \\"Animalize\\" world tour kicked off.) But there's no mistaking that Simmons' attentions were not on \\"Animalize;\\" his songs are either OK (\\"Lonely Is The Hunter\\") or absolutely awful (the cringe-worthy \\"Burn Bitch Burn\\"). Drummer Eric Carr was the best Kiss skin pounder...and it was his untimely death in 1991 that re-galvanized Kiss for [[ASIN:B000001FZP Revenge]].<br /><br />\\"Animalize\\" is good for what it is...80's hair metal done with professional flair. But Kiss was always about the grit and the sleaze. \\"Animalize\\" is slick and straightforward. Not as sub-par as [[ASIN:B00000AF98 Crazy Nights]] or [[ASIN:B00000AF96 Asylum]], \\"Animalize\\" was recorded with a one-shot line-up and marks the beginning of muddled period for Kiss.
B002EC3932|5.0|The trio, rather than the larger group with Rudresh on tenor,  is really the perfect format/foil for Vijay Iyer. This recording is simply stunning, whether youre a fan of extraordinary technique or pure improvisational chops. Just a cursory listen to how Vijay uses a standard like \\"Somewhere\\" as a vehicle for melodic and harmonic reinvention is worth the price of this recording. Among the covers here: Juluis Hemphill's Dogon AD and Smokestack which reveals the clear influence of Andrew Hill on Vijay. Simply stunning.
B00005U122|5.0|Some have complained this is not a 5.1 release...........it isn't. It actually comes across as 4.1. I have a pretty elaborate HT & noticed this by accident. I noticed that there is no sound emanating from my center speaker during playing of this DVD. But since I have my speakers set up to image properly I don't notice it..........the vocals are centered, just like they should be when playing music in plain two channel stereo. And the sound quality is great.    As far as the video quality goes, it's excellent. I don't own a ton of concert DVD's, but I've seen enough to know that this one is good. The only other vid I've seen that beats this one in overall sound & vid quality (not talking about content)is the Eagles: Live from Melbourne/Farewell tour I. That one is recorded in DTS5.1 & appears as almost HD on a regular, progressive-scan DVD player.    There are surely better recordings out there now, but considering \\"Live in the Flesh\\" was recorded 10 years ago it really is pretty damn good. I picked it up about 6 months before Roger announced his world tour (Dark Side of the Moon) for 2006-2008. Needless to say I went to the show. One can only hope that he will release a DVD of his latest, & most likely, last tour. It was spectacular.......
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Alright.  I'll give you the scoop on this album, as a long-time, hardcore fan of the band.  Firstly, I nearly didn't buy the album.  I'd heard Lookin In View by now, liked it well enough.  Didn't care for Check My Head.  On the strong recommendation of a friend, I went ahead and bought it.    There's something about it.  I'd heard many of these songs on YouTube, and thought I had the idea of the album, and wasn't going to buy it.    Buy it.    Do you hear me?  Buy it.  This album has some stunning production work.  The production doesn't 'make' the album, but it certainly delivers the songs in they way required to make you hear the songs as intended.  If you're listening to these songs on YouTube or on your computer, you have no idea.  This album is very special.  It's special because I took a 4 hour drive after the purchase, and was able to really absorb these songs on repeat viewing.  Many of the songs that I thought were weak on the first and second listen, have become my favorites now. Check My Head is a song that should only be listened to loudly.  This album is special, because I get no sense that AIC was trying to \\"recapture\\" something.  There are songs that young AIC would not have done.  There are songs young AIC could not have done.  There is a maturity here.  Many of these songs are miraculous to me.  Like I said, they're not out to recapture what they had before, but they're not pandering either.  These songs are their own, I don't know how to say it better.  When you buy a new album from one of these bands of former grunge glory, you're praying you havent paid full price for a bunch of uninspired-sounding filler.  This album is not like that.  It has my highest recommendation.  So much so, that in all of my years, this is the first album review I've ever given on Amazon or anywhere else.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|Ok, so we've heard nealry all of these songs before, but they are still smoothe as silk from Buble.  This is a beautiful CD, that you can just curl up and unwind to.  In these stressful times, that is a huge plus in my book.  It is best to just listen to the whole CD from start to finish.  It takes you on a magical and restful ride.  Make a nice cup of cocoa or tea and relax....
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Okay, in the spirit of full disclosure, I must say that I have never been a big fan of Michael Buble.  Yes, he is talented - however, I always saw him as a knockoff of Dean Martin or Bing Crosby...and, not a great one at that...<br /><br />This album has changed all that.  In fact, I immediately started creating a playlist for my MP3 player, as soon as I heard this album.  It makes sense, though, since many of the songs were produced by David Foster - who is a musical genius.<br /><br />The opening song, \\"Cry Me a River\\", has great instrumentals,  Wonderful brass licks, and is more like what I expect from old-school Harry Connick, Jr.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The album just continued to get better.  The songs with brass are great, there are wonderful trumpet lines and for the most part this album has a wonderfully romantic feel to it.  I was also pleasantly surprised by \\"Heartache Tonight\\", which in the past only inspired me to change the station on the radio.  No longer.  This version is awesome and fun and I can listen to it over and over, again.<br /><br />The eleventh song, \\"Baby\\", is the best version of the song that I have ever heard...and, as a trumpeter, I can't end the review without mentioning \\"Stardust.\\"  To most jazz instrumentalists, this is one of the most boring, required songs they have ever played (me included) and yet - Michael brings a new \\"old\\" feeling to the song with the addition of the background singers and the sound of a vinyl album.<br /><br />There are a few songs that could have been left off of this album.  I was not impressed with \\"All I Do Is Dream\\" and \\"Whatever It Takes\\"...however, this does not stop me from giving this album a 5!!<br /><br />Can't wait to go listen to it, right now!!!
1933492287|5.0|I've been wanting a long time to buy Cosmic Motors, and it does not disappoint. It's a sweet design/art book jam packed with sweet sketches and even more amazing renderings. Though it's got a few more, uh, cheesecake images than I normally buy, the combo of photo-real renderings (Alias Studio Tools natch) and the real life models is absolutely amazing. Each different ship has a series of sketches and process images, along with several sweet full color renderings complete with pilots, mechanics and other people and props. This is an amazing book
B000O176Q6|5.0|A true classic in HD. Lots of extras, most of them on the DVD edition. It's worth the upgrade if you are a fan.
1600610234|5.0|A surprisingly excellent book, one which I bought for pretty pictures, but actually had a good bit of how-to information. Doug Chiang's book Mechanika looks pretty sweet, promising lots of pictures and sketches, but it also is chock full of Chiang's process, tools and techniques. Actually each one of the \\"projects\\" in the book is a simple step by step, some marker renderings others finished in Photoshop. It's a great book.
0307454541|1.0|I admit it. I was drawn in by the multitude of fabulous reviews, and ordered the book, expecting a literary treat. I also admit that I am reviewing a book I never finished. I could not do it. I am a voracious reader, freelance writer, and former teacher of composition. I know a good book when I read it. This did not even come close. It's ultimate sin was BOREDOM. The first 50 pages were tedious, boring, and uninteresting. I slogged through another 50 pages, and gave up. The characters were unlikeable and annoying. The author's attempt at writing a thriller that would draw you in and hook you fell flat. I had no interest in finding out what happened to which tediously tiresome character. Do not waste your money on this one. I am actually returning the book to Amazon with a strong rebuke concerning their intense marketing of this disaster.
B0000248VB|4.0|This CD has a number of Mancini's mixed in with somed lesser knowns.  It is a mixture of vocal and instrumental--very well done.
0385341008|3.0|Honestly liked the book but kept waiting for more. It was a good start but I was wanting a little more meat . I didn't like the abrupt ending. I ,too, would like to visit Guernsey one day.
0739319175|3.0|Well, this one will not put you to sleep, that's for sure, but it may become a bit predictable. I have read all the Dan Brown's books, and enjoyed the seldom-mentioned \\"Deception Point\\" and \\"Digital Fortress\\" very much. The Robert Langdon books have been enjoyable too, so far, in a fast-paced mystery kind of way. However, now that I am done with another less-then-24-hours chase around a major world capital, I am beginning to see some patterns emerge. Every book contains stunning revelations which end up being very simple truths that leave the readers a bit let-down after the massive build-up. Every book has crazy chases with a friendly, attractive woman who is smart and is a good partner for Langdon but nothing ever comes of it. Every book has a very streamlined chase only to be completely derailed at the end by the before-mentioned stunning revelation about the simple solution.   It's a fun book to listen to, definitely raises some questions, and makes me wonder just how Dan Brown knows all these facts about the masons, D.C. buildings and other secret places. But I would probably get this one from the library if I were you.
B000BNX3B4|1.0|The DVD seems to be defective.  I played well for better than half of the movie but then it would just quit, like someone clicked a 'Pause' button.  If you leave it that way for a few minutes it would pickup at another spot in the movie and then do the same thing again...  How do I get a replacement for this one???
B00001W9G0|5.0|I ordered this movie because I heard from Sarah Jessica Parker that it was a great movie. I love it. It does get pretty sad but It's a great flick, a classic. I got it here for only $3 and some change. Barbra Streisand rocks!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This kept me glued for hours..The best series out there in a long time..Glad, I spent the [...] bucks to get the first season. Amazon deliverd this DVD set very fast..Awesome shipping speed. Good quality DVD's.
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|Well, what can I say?    I was born in 1992 and was never around to see the '80s, and to this day I feel sad about that (maybe more now than ever). This album makes me feel a little better about it.    Fans of this album will take two sides, those who see it as a parody/tribute, and those who see it as a masterpiece in its own right (which is the one that most people I've talked to take). For me (and my friends), this album is waaay to good to be a \\"tribute\\" etc, and labeling it as such only seems to take away how good it is.    There is some serious talent here. Michael Starr has a stellar voice, and their song writing is second to none. My personal favorites are \\"Community Property\\", \\"Eyes of a Panther\\", \\"Fat Girl\\" and \\"The Shocker\\". Those tunes will be stuck in your head for months, guaranteed. I think the weakest track on the album has to be \\"Girl From Oklahoma\\", but never-the-less, still a decent acoustic song. Their live performance's are also second to none. I saw them a few months ago and they totally blew my mind at how good they were and how much stage presence they have, something which can really make or break a band. Definatley the act of the whole show.    I can't recommend it enough, however if I really had to pick faults then I'd say the last track on the album is pretty poor compared to what's come before it. Still don't let that turn you off, if you're a fan of the hair metal era then I'm sure you'll love it. Pay no attention to the negative reviews who throw out claims such as, \\"Talentless garbage\\", \\"Not funny. mindless porno lyrics for 14-yo boys\\" and \\"OMG Im so disgusted. Nothing but cussing and singing about vaginas\\" -- First of all, what do you expect from an album which has songs entitled \\"Asian Hooker\\", \\"Stripper Girl\\" \\"Eatin' Aint Chatin'\\" etc? Second, it's only offensive if you can't handle the truth and honesty of the lifestyle we know as \\"Sex, Drugs and Rock N Roll\\" That's all this album is about, just more honest, and more humerous about the whole thing... and somehow seems to make it a whole lot more appealing!    Also, again, I strongly recommend you DO NOT think of it as a parody. It's just to good for that.
B0000029DD|4.0|The first thing that hit me is the voice. It's transcendent in its beauty and range. Even long wandering notes can hold me transfixed, amazed at the sheer wonder of it. As time goes on and the content starts to seep in, I begin to find myself dissatisfied with the songs themselves, like \\"Mojo Pin's\\" shift from soft melody to jarring loudness, a technique that can be dramatic but here just falls flat or \\"Grace's\\" harmonies that just don't hold up against Buckley's solo voice and music that sounds almost like early ELP with Greg Lake strumming away amidst a lot of other distractions.  But regardless of these flaws, that voice keeps drawing my back in for multiple listenings of songs that might normally find a quiet place on the shelf. And there are wonderful songs here, like \\"So Real\\" where the move from gentle to forceful is much more organic than on \\"Grace,\\" or my favorite Cohen interpretation ever \\"Hallelujah\\" where Buckley takes a simply wonderful song and makes it something unforgettable. Buckley's talent cannot be denied and the idea that this was just the beginning is tragic. GRACE is not perfect, but it is wonderful in its own special way.  An aside to fellow fans of Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\": If you know of a version that is on par with Buckley's incredible interpretation (or just intriguing in its own way, drop me a line. I`ve heard a number of different takes, but Buckley's remains, by far, my favorite.
B00164KYV4|4.0|Very cute romantic comedy.  I wanted to own this DVD, rather than rent it, so that my teenage daughters and I can watch it again and again.  Great for \\"Chick Flick Night\\"!
0385504225|1.0|I found this book to be rambling discriptions. I enjoyed both The DeVinci Code as well as Angels and Demons. The actual action in this book could probably be contained in about one hundred pages, the rest was fill. I felt it an effort to get something on the market for the money.    I will have to think long and hard if I would read another of his books.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|than previous BSB efforts \\"Never Gone\\" and \\"Unbreakable\\" in particular.  But after getting past that and that the cd is only 11 songs long.  I feel they could've added another song or two to round this cd out.  But the songs that are on here upbeat efforts like the first single \\"Straight Through My Heart\\", \\"Masquerade\\", and \\"Bye Bye Love\\" are more akin to stuff that they've done in the past efforts.  However they are still all good songs and could be heard on your standard Top 40 radio stations.  While other efforts like \\"This Is Us\\", \\"Bigger\\" and \\"Shattered\\" you might find on your A/C radio stations.  I really love the last track \\"Undone\\" as it's more of a slower track for the cd and it ends \\"This Is Us\\" rather well.<br /><br />BSB is notably absent from the co-writing process on \\"This Is Us\\" minus two or three songs.  But again despite that the producers/writers that handle the bulk of the cd.  Do a very solid job of getting them out of their comfort zone and doing new things for them on this one.  Overall, their latest effort might not go down great with folks that are comparing it to their previous works.  I try not to do that as artist tend slightly change their sound from cd to cd.  I've listened to it several times and am pleased with this one overall.  I'm glad BSB is back doing it for us all over again.
B002HWBS96|5.0|It is interesting to note that the last three Rosenkavaliers to have been released have all been updated to relatively contemporary setting with one major exception--the Robert Carsen 2004 Salzburg production. But fear not those conservatives who cry \\"no updating, please\\" because truly there is in my estimation nary a concept in sight. Carsen on the other hand has decided to cover the last fifty years of the twentieth century to great effect.     The two most recent, Medici Arts and Decca are set in the fifties for the former and vaguely contemporary for the Decca, the DVD under consideration. This is a production that took place in Baden Baden in January of this year. Overall it is as I have noted a splendid performance and at last enshrines Fleming in one of her best roles. My feelings about this artist have been somewhat mixed heretofore. That the voice itself is a deluxe instrument has never been up for discussion. It is a beautiful voice, but so often one has to wonder about the intellect behind it. For me her low point of her DVD's has been the Chatelet production of Capriccio; it is not a production that distingguishes itself nor is her performance one for the ages as it is self-absorbed and superficial. Updating it to Nazi occupied France was not an idea that works in this \\"chamber\\" opera. The updating in Rosenkavlier is almost beside the point. All the major artists have appeared in more conventional stagings. If anything this has liberated the singing actors to go beneath the surface and offer a profoundly personal reading. The Marschalin'e Act I monologue is a model of sensitivity and mood. Perhaps Fleming cannot offer the textual nuances that a German speaking singer has but she is offering a prize performance that is utterly committed and involving. I suppose that compared to Anne Schwanenwilms (the only native German singer to command the role since Jurinac and Schwarzkopf)there are some niggling points that get lost. Indeed Schwananwilms' performanceremains one of two reasons to acquire the Medici Arts set; the other is the Octavian of Anke Vondung, passionate, intense and blessed with a beautiful voice. Alas the sonics and the performance of Kurt Rydl seriously scupper this DVD. The Sophie is a Japanese soprano with a bright and hard tone that is rarely appropriate. Rydl who has had a distguished career has developed a wobble that fearsome. Additionally the recording level is very low so that it is necessary to boost the volume much higher than is necessary for any other DVD in my collection. Taped in Japan it is mystifying that the engineers would have passed on this issue. Yet I cherish this set for Schwanenwilms; she is not only blessed with great beauty, both physical and vocal, her monologue justifies the whole performance in spite of other criticisms.    Fleming's lover, Octavian, is sung by the French mezzo sophie Koch. Perhaps trumped by Kirchschlager in the Carsen set she is nonetheless a fine contender for the role. Diane Damrau is a superb Sophie; she almost makes you believe that Della Casa really preferred this role to the other two leads. This Sophie is no wilting violet, but then so it Miah Persson in the Carter production; this young Swedish singer is surely bound for a major career.     Franz Hawalta is the Ochs in both Carter and the new set. He is relatively young and a good actor making his performance vital to both sets. The lowest of the low notes are probably not his to sing (for that go to Kipnis and Kurt Moll) but his is far superior to Rydl.     The Italian Tenor is sung by Jonas Kaufmann; it is my understanding that Villazon was scheduled to sing, but health reasons intervened. Kaufmann appears to upset many because of the baritonal underpining in the voice. I hear them, but couldn't care less when listening to this wonderful voice.     The orchestra is the Munich Philharmonic; this is not an opera orchestra but then they are led by Christian Thielemann who is a great Strauss conductor. The Carsen set has the Vienna Phil under Semyon Kychkov who as beome a Strauss conductor par excellence. It's is a tight race but ultimately victory does belong to the Vienna Phil.    Frankly I would hate to have to make a choice between either set. Adrianne Pieczonka is an exciting Marschallin, a lyrico spinto who commands a bigger voice than Fleming, but who also suggests a silvery tone that is essential to sing this role. She appears less emotional than Fleming and Schwanenwilms;for her truly another lover will be on the horizon. This take will not please everyone, but it is a valid interpretation. Ultimately I would suppose that the production will determine the choice for many. I find the Salzburg production witty and imaginative. For once the setting for Act III (a \\"seedy\\" inn) is exactly what you get and more. It is in reality a brothel. The innkeeper is played in drag and there are various sexual escapades that are fairly graphic. Octavian doesn't become Mariandl, but does a wonderful sendup of Marlene Dietrich a la Blue Angel. There is some nudity and I suspect Hofmannsthal or Straus would not approve, but it is truly an original take on the scene. The director is also faced with the gigantic stage, one that Carsen makes use of by staging some action on either side of the Marschallin's boudoir. The second act contains one absurdity: Octavian arrives at Faninal's home riding a horse! This was silly and unnecessary; a comment on Faninal's arrival as a nouveau riche?    I have two conventionally staged performances, Te Kanawa and Lott. I was about to write that this opera is indestructable, but then I remember when a friend brought over the EMI DVD from Zurich. I will refrain from using the usual adjective (E....T....); and although I stuck it our to the end I have to admit that it bordered on the unwatchable. Lott is a wonderful Marschallin, offering wonderful insight into this complex role. She is unusually gifted with language and her experience with lieder is evident in every note that she sings. Te Kanawa is probably the least gifted linguistically of the singers I have singled out. (Too bad that she didn't do yeoman service in Germany as part of her training.) But the voice is undeniably beautiful and she does offer a committed performance. I can't imagine that I will acquire another Rosenkavalier unless the Schwarzkopf is reissued as it surely must be--and soon, I hope. My only resistance to it has been the fact that it was filmed and then lip-synched, but then Schwarzkopf was the Marschallin for so many years courtesy of the San Francisco Opera Company, I will gladly bury my resistance to filmed opera in this instance.
B002HML6Y8|4.0|Hopefully you have already read the editorial & other reviews on this page to get a basic Idea of what the film is about & who plays what etc .. I enjoyed the movie & think the Blu Ray transfer of the picture & sound quality are good. the entire experience is a great work out for your home theatre system.  However the slight drawback is that sometimes with the sharpness & clarity of most Blu Ray discs, we can make out the special effect shots that normally were lost in regular DVD's.  on the plus side is the cost of this disc. I think its worth it if you have been a fan of 'VAN HELSING'

0061914177|5.0|[[VIDEOID:38717071]]I really enjoyed [[ASIN:0061914177 Crush It!: Why NOW Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion]]. It's a quick read of a little less than 150 pages. Typically, I'll take a while to read a book, because I sneak in 5 pages here and there, but I liked this so much that I knocked it out in a day.<br /><br />Crush It! is a sort of inspirational/business read and Gary Vaynerchuk goes through the steps to turn your passion into a successful business.<br /><br />I could see this book being a catalyst for lots of people that hate what they're doing, but just don't have clarity about what they could be doing.<br /><br />In addition to the chapters in the book, I thought it was cool that Gary included \\"Five Ideas I Won't Get to -- They're Yours\\" as Appendix B. One that sticks out to me is an idea Gary mentioned back in January 2008 at Affiliate Summit - a scrappy, homemade version of ESPN SportsCenter online.
1564148793|5.0|Protection and Reversal Magick is a really great break out book by Jason Miller aka Inominandum. It delivers exactly what it promises, and gives a good veriety to boot.For anyone interested in getting a handle on both the theory and practice of magical protections and defenses I could not reccomend this book highly enough.<br /><br />There is tons of useful material in the book for witches, pagans, hoodoo folk, cerimonialists.. pretty much no matter who you are, you'll be bound to find SOMETHING of use, not just of interest, of practical USE to you.<br /><br />There is no rehash, and the author doesnt give you any half digested theory, or practices based on such.<br /><br />The tone is very conversational, both modern in outlook, and traditional in approach. Not throwing out the baby with the bathwater, nor recycling the bathwater in fear of harming the baby.<br /><br />If you are looking for practical, uncomplicated, reliable spellwork, this is a wonderful place to start your search, and a great place to enhance what you already have.
B00000JGHM|5.0|In what is arguably one of the finest heist movies in history, \\"Heat\\" pits two acting heavy-weights in Robert De Niro and Al Pacino against one another. One is a professional thief, so well seasoned that he has avoided the law for as long as he can probably remember. The other is a troubled homicide detective whose third marriage is fizzling out due to his over-riding commitment to his job. Each character ultimately finds he has more in common with his adversary than with his peers. Both are flawed, tired and run-down middle-aged men who, in the immortal words of Roger Murtaugh (see: [[ASIN:B00000G3PL Lethal Weapon - The Complete Series]]) are \\"getting too old for this ....\\"<br /><br />\\"Heat\\" is hardly your average cops and robbers tale. It's long, it's sweeping and is steeped in character moments and conversations. While much of the hype about the film has always revolved around its finale - the bank robbery - it's the small moments that make the film. Take for instance a scene in the middle of the film where Pacino, too tired and beat down to do anything else, tracks down his suspect (De Niro) and invites him for a cup of coffee where the two talk shop and in spite of mutual respect for one another, both vow not to back down. This moment serves to build the tension that is the big pay-off in the film. You get to know and feel for these very real and very flawed characters, so that when the heat is on, so to speak, you don't know who to cheer for anymore.<br /><br />Undeniably, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are the stars of the film and are a large part of its greatness, but it is also Michael Mann's ([[ASIN:B00005JN2Z Collateral (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000UGBOT0 Manhunter]]) unique eye and story-telling sense that defines the film as well. Despite his insuppressible style, the film still retains a gritty, realistic air that is best evidenced in a shootout that takes place in the Los Angeles streets. Without a doubt, this is the director's masterpiece and definitely one of the best of its kind. It's a true epic that is filed to the brim with intense acting (nobody's forgotten about you either, Val) and complicated characters as intricate as the job they are trying to do. For all intents and purposes, \\"Heat\\" lives up to its name.and definitely one of the best of its kind.

B00140PK6O|2.0|Just loved this story.  However, this DVD collection is severely edited from the original BBC production, leaving it shorter and harder to follow.   WTF?  Why did the BBC need to cut so much out?    Sorry I bought these and am hoping the full version will come out soon.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|What can you really say about component cables? When it comes to Amazon Basics, a lot!<br /><br />The build quality on these cables easily rivals what you'd see from Monster or other companies selling them for three or four times as much money. At first, I didn't really like how subtle the R/G/B colors were on the ends, but when I actually connected them, they were just fine and are actually quite nice looking if you have exposed cables in your setup.<br /><br />As far as performance, there's not a negative thing I could say. The picture quality is excellent, and the connectors keep the cables in place quite well. And Amazon's Frustration-Free Packaging is absolutely top-notch! No more cut hands trying to free your cables from ridiculously huge blister packaging.<br /><br />From now on, when I need cables, Amazon Basics is the first place I'll check.

0786888628|5.0|I am a history buff and as such was looking to fill the void that is my lack of knowledge of the Korean War.  I have read Halberstam before and am troubled that this would be his last.      The other reviews have given quite a detailed description of the scope of the book so let it suffice to say that I couldn't put it down.  It has truly been since I first discovered Grisham that I could not put down a book, let alone a non-fiction. Well, I do need to amend that somewhat.  At points in the book I was so overwhelmed with emotion as he recanted veteran's tales, that I had walk away for a day before shaking it off and then eagerly returned.    Yes, it did fill the void and I also learned more than I had ever hoped for on the larger picture of the early years of the cold war, the loss of China and the resultant politics back home.  I certainly had to move Doug MacArthur down a shelf or two on my pantheon of historical figures, but I already knew that he should have retired a few years earlier.     I recommend it to anyone looking to understand the Cold War, the Truman/MacArthur episode, Communist China, military tactics and strategy, or the Washington Politics of the McCarthy era that have some eerie similarities to our own times.  But most of all, it is simply a page turner and you can't wait to read what happens next.     America will miss Halberstam.
B001KK052W|1.0|I am not able to review this item as I haven't received it yet but hey, it's only been a month now since it was supposed to have been shipped (September 12th,it's now October 12th). Maybe it will get here in time to be an early Christmas present.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I have both the theatrical release version and this significantly longer version.  I always wondered why 20th Century Fox did not simply have an intermission like the good ole days and keep Ridley Scott's masterpiece the way he created it.  Theatre owners would have sold more concessions.  More profit.    Eva Green fans will --absolutely-- want the longer version.    I'm happy to have both.      The story helps us to appreciate what was happening during the \\"Crusades,\\" and there are ample historical perspectives from comments by historians on the bonus disc(s), which help the viewer to know what parts of the film were dramatic elements having no basis in fact, and which parts were historically accurate as much as is possible.  The film helps modern viewers to better understand why things in the Middle East are the way they are now.  More importantly, it also provides a model to help envision the possibilities for peace and how that might be administered.    The story has one of the best morals out there.  There are many lessons and reminders to be had in watching this film, either version.  The best sort of entertainment is this kind.    There are certain aspects of the story impossible to understand by watching only the theatrical release.  These aspects have been mentioned as spoilers in other reviews already.  Also already stated, the biggest difference between the two versions is in character development.  Especially Sybella.  In the Director's Cut, the capacity to understand the torment Sybella had to be feeling, on multiple levels at the same time is wholly present, while in the theatrical release- no.  The story is completely tragic and yet hopeful at the same time.  Resolution never fully materializes, while in our current reality, there is no resolution in the Middle East, either.  The end is happy or not.  You must choose. Decide. This, is another stroke of genius.  The script is top flight.     Viewers are shown how individuals, societies, cultures, governments, religions- often unjustly vilify that which is foreign to them in order to justify their own selfish conquests.  The downfall of humanity via untempered and misguided ego-driven wanton lusts in the pursuit of material gain is well illustrated.      The Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut is one of the finest cinematic works that I have ever seen and likely will have ever seen.    Casting is perfect, acting perfect, location- set design, costumes, screen play, the whole of it, has been crafted to complete perfection.    I rarely would say, If you are reading this and don't have it yet, you should stop procrastinating and buy it already. If you have neither version and can only have one, then by all means, get the Director's Cut.  Get the version that Ridley Scott intended, not the cookie-cutter butchered edition forced onto the masses by 20th Century Fox executives.    Chivalry is forever alive in The Kingdom of Heaven.

B000BZIST4|5.0|Back in the days before the Oscars were hijacked by politically correct pressure groups who were only interested in rewarding boring films that promoted their tedious agendas and concerns, there were a few years in the seventies when they actually rewarded films that were well-written, well-shot and well-acted pieces of drama which, more importantly, said something valuable about the human condition regardless of how unseemly, politically incorrect or unfashionable such statements or observations might have been.     William Friedkin's \\"The French Connection\\" was such a film.    Friedkin freely adapted the exploits of Eddie \\"Popeye\\" Egan and Sonny Grosso - two New York cops who, through a mixture of tenacity, intellect and plain old-fashioned hard work, managed to bust a highly lucrative narcotics pipeline that was flooding the boroughs of New York with Heroin - into a superlative example of the police thriller and a masterclass in film-making. The film itself is essentially a police procedural in which NYC Narcotics detectives Jimmy \\"Popeye\\" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider) initially become aware of a new player on the drugs scene after noticing something amiss whilst drinking in a bar, and then track their way back along the chain of dealers, traffickers and money-men to the source, Gallic Narcotics trafficker and former Marseilles Longshoreman, Alain \\"Frog One\\" Charnier (Fernando Rey) - who is gearing up to import a vast shipment of smack into the US.    What sets Friedkin's film apart from the numerous scores of predecessors and imitators was it's absolute commitment to reality: Hackman's Doyle is a hard-bitten, unflinching, bully of an obsessive who is only too happy to beat a suspect up in an alleyway if it will get him one step closer to the object of his quest and it is his increasing obsession with collaring the elusive \\"Frog One\\" that eventually becomes the focus of the film; the final devastating moments illustrating to both his shockedpartner and the audience just how far along the path of darkness he is prepared to go in order to make his collar. Neither Friedkin nor Hackman shy away from depicting what \\"Popeye\\" Doyle 'is' and I cannot imagine that a major studio in this day and age would release a film featuring the plentiful depictions of Afro-Americans being systematically harassed by the Police that appear in this film. Similarly, Friedkin's commitment to almost Verite-style location shooting manages to capture New York in all of it's recession-blighted early seventies dilapidation. It looks like the last place on the Earth that you'd want to make your home and is the stark antithesis of the kind of whimsically nostalgic portrayal of the city recently screen in the terrible, execrable US remake of \\"Life On Mars\\".      In terms of acting, Hackman and Scheider have never been better than they are in this film and make possibly the most realistic cop duo to ever grace the screen. The respect, tolerance, weariness and latent antagonism of two men who have spent a considerable amount of time watching each other's backs is there for all to see. In opposition to many of today's so-called screen actors, they 'show', they don't 'tell'.    \\"The French Connection\\" is a brilliant film that quite rightly garnered 'best director' and 'best actor' Oscars for Friedkin and Hackman respectively in 1972.     If you have any interest in cinema, consider it a must-see and pick up this lavish two-disc edition package.

B00005UEAR|3.0|I give this album four stars for Disc 2 and two stars for Disc 1.  Disc 2 has that progressive flow that DT is so well known for.  There is an overall theme of different personality types and how they interrelated and the theme works pretty good overall. It doesn't work as well as Scenes from a Memory, but it is still pretty cohesive.  The playing is impressive without being over indulgent, which can be a DT weakness from time to time.  The songs are melodic and well written.      On the other hand, Disc 1 is a throw away (in my opinion). The only one I will listen to is Disc 2, as Disc 1 is unlistenable.  The songs are overlong and not intersting.  Also overly heavy. Obviously, I realize DT is a metal progressive band, but the songs remind me of songs from Train of Thought, which I listened to twice and then shelved.  I might have enjoyed the metal side more in high school, but I must've gotten my dose of metal, b/c heavy DT is too much for my tastes nowadays!  Enjoy this album as it is their last good album (i.e. disc 2) in my humbe opinion. Cheers!

It was like too many details were missing and he did not take the time to fully tell the story.  Maybe my expectations are just too high.  I'm glad I read it and will read his next book, but it's  not in the same league as his other works.  I just wanted more.

Abbado´s tenure conducting the LSO has been always a matter of  miracle for me (much better than his years in Berlin), and this Mendelssohn cycle is a great  sample of this statement. As a highest peak here, let´s mention a superp \\"Lobgesang\\" that is  for my taste the best available on record. Have it with confidence.

I purchased it first as an audio book and have been using the hard copy to back up all the facts with the recommendations and studies in this book. I highly recommend the audio cd, as it's a bit dry reading, but very fascinating.<br /><br />The conclusions that the Dairy & Meat industries are funding much of our dietary studies and helping to set dietary standards which slant to their industry is disgusting, misleading and it's killing us. Here we are in the 2009 and we have become fatter and fatter and fatter. Check out the slideshow on this site to watch the % of obesity rates climb from 1985 to 2008:[...]. I'm sure it's NOT coincidental that there appears to be an increase in obesity the more technologically savvy we get and the less we have to walk, hike, do manual labor + the fact our children are playing video games in a frozen position. Thank god for the Nintendo Wii video game console (had fun playing tennis and bowling recently) device and others like it which actually make your exercise while playing video games.<br /><br />So, it is boring, but it appears to be the answer to obesity, diabetes, heart attacks, cancer and probably MS: eat a whole foods, plant based diet, with minimal processed foods and you'll live a much longer and pain-free life.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|In 1994, Terry Goodkind would embark on the beginning of his novels known as \\"The Sword of Truth\\".  With over 25 million copies of his books sold worldwide, many enjoyed the story of the adventures of three individuals: Richard Cypher, Kahland Amnell and Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander on their quest to end the tyranny of their work caused by Darken Rahl.<br /><br />14 years and eleven novels later, plans for a syndicated television series loosely based on the books would become reality and would include the name of Executive Producer Sam Raimi (\\"Spider-Man\\" and \\"Evil Dead\\" films), Robert Tapert (\\"Xena: Warrior Princess\\"), Joshua Donen (\\"Underneath\\", \\"The Quick and the Dead\\"),  Josh Shiban (\\"The X-Files\\", \\"Enterprise\\"), Kenneth Biller (\\"Six Degrees\\", \\"Smallville\\", \\"Dark Angel, \\"Star Trek: Voyager\\") and co-executive produced by Stephen Tolkin (\\"Summerland\\").<br /><br />Because TV syndication requires a story for each episode, there is only so much that could be attributed to the book in 40-45 minutes of television.  So, creatively there are differences from the television show and the book and thus the episodes are loosely based on the series.<br /><br />The story of \\"Legend of Seeker\\" takes place in three main provinces: Westland, The Midlands and D'Hara.  The Westlands is separated from the Midlands due to a magical boundary in order to prevent magic from entering the Westland.  In D'Hara, the evil Darken Rahl uses his black magic to cause fear within his people and has amassed a great army but now he wants more power and wants to expand his domination into the midlands.  Darken Rahl  has sent his men after two Confessors who have stolen a book.<br /><br />During these dark times, one can hope that an long-old tale of a prophecy comes true.  Those who are familiar with the prophecy hope that one day, a person known as the Seeker will eliminate the tyranny of D'Hara and free those who have lived under oppression and tyranny due to Darken Rahl's leadership.  But with no Seeker having appeared, many feel that the prophecy is just a myth.<br /><br />For Darken Rahl, he feels known one can stop him because he eliminated all the first born sons in a village where the Seeker was to be born.  So, for over two decades, he has lived comfortable...that is until now.<br /><br />When two Confessors (a group of women who have magical powers who oversee the welfare of the people in the Midlands) try to escape Darken Rahl's army, they escape from D'Hara into the Midlands where they go and search for a wizard named Zeddicus \\"Zedd\\" Zu'l Zorander who is supposed to be training the Seeker.<br /><br />One of the Confessors named Khalan Amnell was able to successfully make it through the boundary but was still chased by a few men of Darken Rahl's army.  As she was surrounded by the men, a young man named Richard Cypher manages to save her in the process.  While Khalan leaves Richard to find Zed and the Seeker, the two are then encountered by Richard in which it is revealed that Richard is in fact the Seeker.<br /><br />Throughout the first season of the series, we get to see Richard, Khalan and Zedd go through village to village in order to escape from Darken Rahl but to also fight against those who are oppressed by him and let people know that the prophecy of the Seeker is true.  Along the way, the three help people in need and help to rid of Darken Rahl's control in those villages.<br /><br />But as the three protagonists fight for the common folk, we see how powerful Darken Rahl is and the people he has working for him.  But at the same time, through the courage of Richard, Khalan and Zedd, the word about the Seeker and how he stands against Darken Rahl starts to spread throughout the three provinces.<br /><br />The main characters in the first season of \\"Legend of the Seeker\\" are:<br /><br />Richard Cypher (played by Craig Horner, \\"Blue Water High\\", \\"H20: Just Add Water\\" and \\"Monarch Cove\\") - Richard is learning to be the Seeker.  Throughout his adventure, he learns a lot about himself and the people in the land and wanting to help them.  He's a kind-hearted man who will fight evil.  He is attracted to the Confessor Kahlan and is the main protagonist of the series.<br /><br />Kahlan Amnell (played by Bridget Regan, \\"The Black Donnellys\\") - A Confessor who's mission is to protect the Seeker.  A Confessor can help those who confess and inside, they know the truth.  When she touches a person, she can control them by making them confess and briefly taking over their body and making them do whatever she wants.

In the 80s, there was `Star Trek: The Next Generation', in the 90s there was `Xena: Warrior Princess' and now, I have to say that `Legend of the Seeker' must be put on that list.  It's hard to believe that this series is not shown throughout the USA but for those who have been curious about the series and have heard the rave reviews, this is one series that is truly fantastic and definitely worth watching!<br /><br />This was a series that from the moment I started watching, I was instantly hooked and it was like a marathon of \\"Legend of the Seeker\\" weekend because I enjoyed it so much.  From the first episode, what caught my interest was the fact that it was shot in New Zealand.  The shots were absolutely beautiful and the whole concept of the Seeker, the Confessor, the Wizard and this tyrannical dark ruler was actually fascinating to me and I found that each of the talent casted for their roles were absolutely perfect.<br /><br />I should emphasize that before watching this series, I haven't read any of Terry Goodkind's novels and I am familiar with disgruntled fans who were hoping the novels would receive a Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings film adaptation and also upset about the fact that the series is \\"loosely\\" based on the novels.  But for what the writers and crew had to work with, I happened to find each episode so captivating, beautiful and just so addicting.<br /><br />It's one thing to watch the adventures of Richard, Kahlan and Zedd but when you see the Mord'sith character, you start to see how the series is a bit derivative to films like \\"Star Wars\\" and also Biblical stories and action sequences that are reminiscent to \\"Matrix\\" and \\"300'.  But since I'm a fan of those stories, those little moments that are integrated into each episode, I personally wasn't disappointed by any of that.  The writers managed to keep each storyline quite fresh and entertaining that I felt that with each episode, you got something different each time.<br /><br />\\"Legend of the Seeker: The Complete First Season\\" has definitely made me a fan but I do find it surprising that even 'til now, the nearest airing of this syndicated show is nearly 200-miles away (the official website has a zip code tracker to show you watch channel the show airs) and that is disappointing.  But for now, for anyone who has been curious about this show, this complete first season on DVD is definitely worth owning.  I enjoyed this series so much that I am hoping to hear it gets a High Definition transfer because the series looks quite beautiful.  But overall, among the many television shows that are airing on the networks and cable networks, it's nice to hear that there is a rare gem that exists in syndication.<br /><br />\\"Legend of the Seeker: The Complete First Season\\" is highly recommended!rd's Sword of Truth.

B0024FAR5W|5.0|\\"Sons of Anarchy\\" comes from the mind of Kurt Sutter, a former writer and co-producer of FX's popular (and now recently concluded) series \\"The Shield\\".  Joining Sutter are fellow writers Dave Erickson (\\"Canterbury's Law\\") and Jack LoGiudice (\\"Street Time\\", \\"Resurrection Blvd.\\" and \\"7th Heaven\\"), composer Bob Theile Jr. (\\"The Office\\") and cinematography by Paul Maibaum (\\"My Boys\\", \\"Samantha WHO?\\" and \\"Related\\").<br /><br />The drama series revolves around a motorcycle club known as the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original (SAMCRO).  With SAMCRO chapters across the country, the original Sons of Anarchy motorcycle club was formed in an area called Charming.  Members consist of normal men who have their own responsibilities, life style and jobs but what they have in common is their allegiance towards the club.  And that allegiance includes being part of a life of danger.  For the Sons of Anarchy, the group makes a lot of money by dealing with importing illegal weapons which they sell to other gangs in the Bay Area (primarily the East Bay area), dealing with other organizations or mafia connections but taking a pride in their city and protecting local businesses and the people of the area.<br /><br />They are well-connected and also have ties to the inside of law enforcement and thus, are able to maintain their operations.  But of course, all is not safe as major gangs are there to cause the club some havoc.  There are those who try to mess with them or steal SAMCRO's shipments such as the white supremacist group known as the \\"Nords\\", their Latino rivals from Oakland known as the \\"Mayans\\" and possibly other dangers including the authorities.<br /><br />The first season of \\"Sons of Anarchy\\" focuses on member Jax (Charlie Hunman, \\"Undeclared\\", \\"Hooligans\\"), a member who tends to takes care of operations for the club and is quite respectful of his allegiance to the club that his father John had started and ran until his death many years ago.<br /><br />SAMCRO is now run by Clarence \\"Clay\\" Morrow (Ron Perlman, \\"Hellboy\\" films and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\") who married Jax's mother Gemma (Katey Sagal, \\"Married with Children\\", \\"Futurama\\", \\"8 Simple Rules...For Dating My Teenage Daughter\\") and have lived a life of making money but now are starting to feel the financial constraints.<br /><br />Both have made the Sons of Anarchy to a club that is profitable (due to the club's illegal dealings) but things start to change when Jax discovers his father's belongings especially with the discovery of his dead father's unpublished manuscript.  It appears that his father has envisioned change for the Sons of Anarchy and because of this, Jax notices that with all the trouble and danger the club faces now, perhaps its time to change things for the positive for the club.<br /><br />Jax eventually starts to show doubts towards the club's activities and starts to become more compassionate to the personal lives of some of the members and thus puts himself into a position that can lead to conflict with the his step-father/leader of the Sons of Anarchy.  Of course, this change of thought starts to rub certain members the wrong way, some who question Jax's ability to lead in the future.<br /><br />Needless to say, Jax's mother, Gemma starts to be concerned of her son's interest in her dead husband's belongings and looks at things as if her deceased husband is trying to talk to her son from the grave.  Thus, she wants her husband Clay to make sure that Jax doesn't hurt the operations of the Sons of Anarchy and make sure he doesn't stray.<br /><br />Throughout the series, we get to see how the club operates but most of all how tight or how troubled the internal brotherhood is between the members of the motorcycle club and the dangers they face.<br /><br />Members of the Son of Anarchy also include:<br /><br />  * Bobby \\"Elvis\\" Munson (Mark Boone Junior) - The treasurer of the club and an Elvis impersonator<br />  * Tig Trager (Kim Coates) - The sergeant-at-arms.  Clay's right hand man and incredibly violent.  Doesn't believe in Jax as the successor to the club.<br />  * Filip \\"Chibs\\" Telford (Tommy Flanagan) - The medic of the club that served for the British Army.<br />  * Piermont \\"Piney\\" Winston (William Lucking) - Opie's father and co-founder of SAMCRO.<br />  * Harry \\"Opie\\" Winston (Ryan Hurst) - A member of SAMCRO who has been off-an-on with the group because of his obligations to his wife and kids.  Thus he stays away from their illegal activities.<br />  * Juan Carlos \\"Juice\\" Ortiz (Theo Rossi) - The club's intelligence officer, ahe hacker and the guy with the inside connections.<br />  * Kip \\"Half-Sack\\" Epps (Johnny Lewis) -  A member of the club and former Iraq vet.<br /><br />\\"Sons of Anarchy - Season One\\" is featured on three Blu-ray discs.  Here is a spoiler-less summary of each episode:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * EPISODE 1 - Pilot - Introduction to the characters and Jax's pregnant ex-girlfriend goes into a drug overdose and harms his baby.

Skin tones are natural and you can catch some scenes with the skin pores and for the most part, the picture quality is brilliant although you do see occasional grain but definitely not distracting.<br /><br />Audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (Spanish in Dolby Digital).  \\"Sons of Anarchy\\" is a series that takes advantage of the lossless audio track.From the revving of the engines of the Harley-Davidson motorcycles to the booms of explosions and the gunshots, the series definitely utilizes the surrounds during those action-scenes.<br /><br />For the most part, the explosions and weapons are minimal and most of the audio is dialogue-driven and is primarily front and center channel driven.  As with the rock music that plays throughout the series.  But for the most part, fans of the series will enjoy the lossless track and its use of the various channels throughout the series.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Sons of Anarchy - Season One\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />On disc 1, select audio and you will be able to find the following audio commentary:<br /><br />  * Commentary for Pilot - Featuring audio commentary with Kurt Sutter, Guy Feeland, Charlie Hunnam, Ron Perlman and Katey Sagal.<br /><br />DISC 2:<br /><br />On disc 2, select audio and you will be able to find the following audio commentary:<br /><br />  * Commentary for the Pull - Featuring audio commentary with Kurt Sutter, Guy Feeland, Maggie Siff and Charlie Hunnam.<br /><br />DISC 3:<br /><br />  * Commentary for the Revelator- Featuring audio commentary with Kurt Sutter, Charlie Hunnam, Ron Perlman, Kim Coates, Mark Boone Junior, Theo Rossi, Ryan Hurst, William Lucking, Johnny Lewis and Tommy Flanagan.<br />  * The Making of Sons of Anarchy, Season 1 - (8:59) Interviews with the producers, creator and cast about the series.

The interesting thing is that back in the late 1970's, the outlaw life was typically portrayed on television as this hell-bent biker gang but films really never fully explored it well, actually, if anything, they were just used as an episode of \\"C.H.I.P.S\\" and were people wreaking havoc on innocents.<br /><br />There is a culture among the biker clubs and it was great to see a series that featured characters in a variety of depth and it is quite evident that creator/writer Kurt Sutter did his research well in capturing that culture, the look and feel of the individuals (and of course, great casting) but bringing together this gritty storyline of opposing gangs and rival biker clubs and creating this world where life is not always peaceful and allegiance for the club, you need to sacrifice for the club.  Personally, I was captivated by the storytelling and from beginning to end, realize that hell is going to break loose in Season 2.  Granted, I say this not knowing anything about motorcycle gangs up-close and personal but I would assume with all the time that Sutter spent with the various motorcycle clubs, there are some aspects of that culture that he brought into this fictional drama series.  And of course, that correlation to Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" makes the series quite intriguing.<br /><br />I have to admit that before watching theseries, I wasn't sure how Charlie Hunnam (who typically plays popular guy that the girls dig type of roles), Katey Sagal who has been in more sitcom-based shows and more dramatic series and of course, Ron Perlman, an actor that viewers are used to seeing him in \\"Hellboy\\" or the old classic \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" series.  But for the most part, each of the talent did wonderful job and the series is literally well-cast.  Hunnam as Jax sans the English accent almost has this Heath Ledger type of feel to his character that works.  Katey Sagal does an excellent job playing a mother, but a mother who has the potential of going bad.  And of course, Ron Perlman definitely has that look of a person you don't want to cross.  Add in the other talent and  overall, the way they play their characters are is convincing.  Again, the talent are definitely well-cast!<br /><br />The Blu-ray further enhances the enjoyment of the series with picture quality really capturing the violence and grittiness of the series.  In the first episode, the first time you lay your eyes on the charred remains of two people, you know that this series is not going to be \\"pedestrian\\" and by the end of the first episode, you realize that the series is quite violent but fits the situation quite well.  As mentioned before, the lossless audio track definitely compliments the series, especially for those who can't get enough of that engine revving of the Harley's in high definition.  Also, picture quality is well-done and again, as beautiful as the scenery is of the mountain regions and the camera panning through the various Harley's, the picture quality also captures the detail of the violence of the series.<br /><br />\\"Sons of Anarchy - Season One\\" was definitely a big surprise for me and it's good to know that FX has continued the trend of having well-written, well-cast and overall, another riveting drama series.  Overall, this series is highly recommended!most part, the explosions and weapons are minimal and most of the audio is dialogue-driven and is primarily front and center channel driven.

B000NQRE0K|5.0|Finally it's done for wait this Bluray Braveheart. Movie's fan knew how's this film. When they come to Bluray...sound and picture is awesome. Think Movie collector should have this one.
B002MW50KO|2.0|I listened to the clips of this album and it's a good thing I did. Whatever has happened to Dylan's voice? I guess if you are nostalgic for your deceased grandfather, the one who insisted on singing off-key at every family get-together this is your album. But I like my Christmas music to be more ... festive. The man is a classic, yes, but this album is not.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|This album is different from the other ones. The Backstreet Boys are taking another direction, more uptempo songs like Bye Bye Love, All Of Your Life, PDA, Masquerade, good for clubbing. But there is the vocal harmony I love so much especially in the songs Bigger, This Is Us, Shattered + She´s A Dream. Truly beautiful. R n B songs If I Knew Then + Undone. Cannot decide which one is my overall fave. I recommend the Deluxe Version as the videos are awesome as well.
1416583408|5.0|Scientifically, we might know a lot more about rats than we do about dogs.  There are some experimental labs that have dogs as subjects, but lab rats get a lot of scientific attention.  Dogs get a lot of domestic attention, but scientific study of dogs, and the ways they get along with humans and with other dogs, has not been a high concern.  That may be because we think we know dogs; they are frank and open, and we live closely with them.  Alexandra Horowitz thinks we don't know enough, and some of what we know is wrong, and she is out to change our perception of dogs and to do it scientifically.  She has to work at making herself a detached observer; she might be a psychologist who has studied cognition in humans, dogs, bonobos, and rhinoceroses, but among the first sentences of her book _Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know_ (Scribner) is, \\"I am a dog person.\\"  Is she ever.  She didn't deliberately make Pumpernickel, her mixed breed live-in friend (she is an advocate for adopting mutts), a subject of scientific study, but Pump was her entrance, for instance, to the dog park where she could film the interactions of other dogs for acute detailed study later.  She gives loving anecdotes of  the late Pump in every chapter to illustrate her more objective findings, nicely showing how her scientific examination of dogs paid off in her understanding of her own dog.  There are people who worry that scientific examination of any phenomenon takes away the mystery and specialness of the phenomenon, and among the fine lessons in this amusing and enlightening book is that this is far from true.<br /><br />Dogs do not sense the world we do.  To take one of Horowitz's examples, a rose for humans is a thing of visual and olfactory beauty, and also has connotations of a love gift.  Dogs are having none of this.  It is just another plant among all the plants that surround it; it does not look attractive, and unless some dog has urinated on it recently, it does not smell attractive.  Otherwise, the rose doesn't exist.  The dog's world is one largely of smells.  Everyone knows that dogs are better at detecting odors than we are.  It isn't just that they can smell more scents, at thinner concentrations, than we; it's that they gaze at the world by sniffing, and it presents a very different world from ours.  Smell, for dogs, has plenty of meanings, but one of them is time.  A strong spell is new, a fading one is old.  Not only that, but the future may be borne on a breeze if the dog is walking upwind.  In scents, the dog doesn't just experience the current scene in an olfactory way, \\"...but also a snatch of the just-happened and the up-ahead.  The present has a shadow of the past and a ring of the future about it.\\"  Dogs are evolutionarily descended from wolves, and sometimes dog owners are advised to treat their dogs as lower-caste members of a pack.  Horowitz prescribes caution in such interpretations.  Dogs are not wolves and have cast away many wolf traits during their evolution.  A person (non-wolf) attempting to subdue a dog (non-wolf) in wolf fashion is missing what is special about the human-dog bond.  Dogs, for instance, like eye contact; wolves avoid it.  There are many experiments described here (some of which Horowitz has herself been in charge of), and one of them involves \\"gaze following\\".  Dogs can look at our eyes, and can tell where we are looking, so they look over that way, too.  The sections of the book that are the most fun are the ones on play.  Dogs play more than wolves do, and unlike most animals, they play as adults.  It is a bit of a mystery; it isn't essential for dogs to play to get their needed social skills, and it does cost energy and the risk of injury.  Horowitz describes the play cues dogs give that can only be seen by humans using very slow video replays, but which keep the play non-aggressive for the participating dogs.  Dogs are good at following these rules; a strapping wolfhound and a tiny Chihuahua can negotiate a play session efficiently, with the former handicapping itself to enjoy the mock aggressiveness of the latter.<br /><br />Horowitz has provided a useful service in her brightly-written summary of experiments and current theories on the minds of dogs.  I have an idea that people keep dogs around not just because of their goofy affection for us, or because they are so entertaining, but simply because they are interesting.  It is fun to see how a creature who has evolved an intelligence different from our own gets along in the world.  Horowitz's book helps explain that interest, and heighten it.negotiate a play session efficiently, with the former handicapping itself to enjoy the mock aggressiveness of the latter.

0061914177|5.0|Crush It!: Why NOW Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion by Gary Vaynerchuk is for sure written by a motivational speaker; however, it was also written by a phenomenally-successful self-made businessman and social media maven. Rare is the motivational business book with an actual flight plan and pre-flight check list.<br /><br />The book was written by dictation, is very spoken-word and accessible, and ends up mixing cocksuredness with earnestness in such a way that is very appealing.<br /><br />What makes this potentially hubristic book work is that Gary throws open all the windows, doors, closets, and cabinets in his life and his business, revealing his entire coming up, his relationship with business, his passion for sports and for finding unfulfilled markets and fulfilling them.<br /><br />What is revealed is that there is no overnight superstars and you cannot make money fast and that the real world doesn't goIPO 18-months after launch. He reveals that you need to roll up your sleeves and go for the long haul and in reward you'll probably be able to make fifty-grand for all your hard work -- but, doing what you love and what pops you up first light and puts you to bed just before dawn.<br /><br />[...]. Even though this book will motivate you to ignite your passion, here's some insight into some of topics based on chapter titles: 1: Passion is Everything, 2: Success is in Your DNA, 3: Build Your Personal Brand, 4: A Whole New World, 5: Create Great Content, 6: Choose Your Platform, 7: Keep it Real ... Very Real, 8: Create Community: Digging Your Internet Trench, 9: The Best Marketing Strategy Ever, 10: Make the World Listen, 11: Start Monetizing, 12: Roll with It, 13: Legacy is Greater Than Currency, Conclusion: The Time is Now, the Message is Forever, Appendix A: Did You Forget Anything?, Appendix B: Five Business Ideas I Won't Get to -- They're Yours.<br /><br />The book starts with three rules that set the tone and are echoed again and again throughout the book: Love you family, work superhard (sic), and live your passion.<br /><br />What Gary offers in very casual, spoken, everyman prose is the answers to how to channel your passion, what real hustle looks like, how to attract advertisers, why building a personal brand through social media is crucial, why your business should be build on your personal brand, how social networking can find your next financial opportunity, how companies should use social networks to share their story and brand, how to build legacy -- worth more than money -- to build a successful brand.<br /><br />One thing I found interesting -- and unique -- in a motivational business book is that Vaynerchuk spent the entire book insisting on a long-game. He tends to offer the sort of advice my grandfather might offer: take care of your family and make sure your family and you are happy, through hard work and through devoting your life to your career and your business -- build it up and keep working your entire life, if that's what it takes.<br /><br />Do not buy the house in order to flip it, buy the house to live in it, restore it, and give it to your children.<br /><br />This is sobering advice from someone who often sounds like he's trying to get us rich quick.  In other words, I am amazed and impressed by this moral motivational treatise that is actually antithetical to most modern passion-fueled motivational business books.<br /><br />The book is almost entirely self-centered.  The brands of Gary Vaynerchuk, WineLibraryTV, Wine Library NJ, VaynerMedia and the Vaynerchuk family are the source of all of the narratives, which is fine because that's what Gary knows and what Mark Twain recommends, \\"write what you know.\\"  I know that while I couldn't help but see this self-made man and think about that hackneyed NYC joke,<br /><br />  Q: How do you make 50-million dollars?<br />  A: Start with 5-million dollars<br /><br />When Gary tells of how he turned his father's $5M liquor store into a $50M winesuper-store, but even these contradictions don't work against the narrative and good advice because theVaynerchuks are a very tight clan and Gary was there all the way from the beginning and the beginning includes emigrating from Belarus in 1979 as a family, immigrating to Queens with nothing, his dad take a job as a stock boy in a liquor store, and then buying the store, buying another store, building a business, and passing his DNA of work and family to his son, Gary.<br /><br />This really is an American rags-to-riches story and Gary is a rare bird for exposing himself so completely and sharing his successes and challenges with a great deal of earnestness.<br /><br />I must admit that I am not a wine connoisseur so I never cottoned to watching Gary Vaynerchuk (@garyvee) every week on his WineLibraryTV video blog. Shame on me because I really never got to know \\"Gary Vee\\" until I heard him speak at the end of August at the Gravity Summit in Boston at Harvard.

Gary motivated and delighted me with his passion and old-world advice: love your family, work hard, and follow your passion.  If you like his keynote and you feel his passion and if you feel your heart race a little just thinking about dumping your current job and crushing it through passion, blood, and sweat, this book's for you.<br /><br />If you don't end up falling in love with Gary, though, this might not be the book for you.<br /><br />This is a very personal book that will help break everything down for you. He doesn't just tell you that you can do it, Gary actually breaks down his entire brand, all the successes he has had, and all of the processes and habits and hard work he does -- [...]-- and tell the reader which social networks to use, which video-sharing sites (he likes Viddler because the signal to noise ration is better), and the kind of detail people will find rewarding such as how to monetize, how to find sponsors and advertising dollars, and how it is essential not to obsess about traditional media metrics, analytics, and web site hits -- to think longer-term -- not how many people visit but who.<br /><br />Gary saves a gift for the end Crush It!  Appendix A offers what I like to call a \\"pre-flight check-list\\" wherein he creates a list (a wine-reduction, if you will) of all the steps that you should go through and check off -- 21 steps you really should take on your way towards building your own personal brand.<br /><br />Hell, the book is wee -- only 137 pages -- and I read it in one-hour at the gym on the machines.  Was it worth my hour?  Well, for $[...] on Amazon it's a no-brainer.

0143034901|5.0|\\"Memories are worse than bullets\\" from page 427 of \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by Carlos Ruiz Zafon captures the coloring of this story - imbued with the memories of the key players.  The tale is elegantly written (though a bit too long), beautifully translated (with a few glaring blunders), and totally mesmerizing. It was hard to put down and easy to pick up again. As to the funniest translation mistake, see Page 343, \\"...that the dice had been cast,\\" a whopping misunderstanding of the phrase \\"the die has been cast.\\"<br /><br />The setting is 1940s and 1950s Barcelona (with side trips to Paris). The author has captured the feel of post civil-war, post world war II Spain perfectly. And, as a bonus, there is a tour map with pictures and guiding narrative at the end of the book for those who want to trace the steps of the book's characters as they lived in this story.<br /><br />Some of the over-intellectualizing critics here (see the very few negative reviews) kind of miss the point. This is a great story, written by a very talented story-teller, filled with wonderfully developed and interesting characters. Is it literature?  Is War and Peace literature?  Is Madame Bovary?  Is anything written by ANY modern author literature?  We all know Dan Brown does not write literature - he writes outlines for screen plays, for instance. I actually don't care. I loved this story and the way it was written.<br /><br />There are innumerable lines to underline and ponder.  \\"Telling the truth should be kept as a last resort, Daniel, even more so to a nun,\\" spoken on Page 253 by my favorite character in the book, the hilarious Fermin Romero de Torres. Or, \\"The most efficient way of rendering the poor harmless is to teach them to imitate the rich,\\" page 198.  And, \\"...what destiny does not do is home visits. You have to go for it,\\" page 225.<br /><br />Most of the negative reviews omit to say that this book is hilarious, time and time again.  It is also sad, filled with pathos and violent in places. One sees both the good and terrible side of men and women.<br /><br />The story bogs down somewhat during the long narrative by Nuria Monfort, where we learn important details of the various mysteries and intrigues central to the unraveling of the story. At times here and elsewhere in the book the writing suffers from what I would call TMI (too much information), when less would be better.  The story is complicated as are the players, but all to the better. The reader has to \\"work\\" a little bit to catch on to the threads of the story, but in the last analysis the mystery is not so hard to solve. Any astute reader can be well ahead of the story teller here, but that does not ruin anything.<br /><br />I do not really know what a gothic novel is, but apparently this is a modern version of \\"romance mixed with horror.\\" The romance part vastly overshadows the horror part in this story. But the horror is quite graphic and sufficient. The evil character is indeed evil.  It's hard to decide who the central character is\\" Daniel or Julian, as their lives and personalities become intertwined.<br /><br />My major criticism focuses on my confusion about the \\"voice\\" of the story. Who really is the narrator?  Ostensibly it is Daniel, but...............there are many pages where other voices take center stage. At times I had to read 3 or 4 pages of these other \\"voices\\" before I was sure about exactly who was \\"talking.\\"  Carlos Ruiz Zafon does not have as big a problem as Arturo Perez-Reverte about \\"voice of the story,\\" but Zafon confused me at times.<br /><br />There really is no denouement.  Like all good, real stories, all of the players and themes simply merge together at the end, and the epilogues finish off any further questions a reader might have. I found the ending very satisfying.<br /><br />\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is an enormously pleasurable read.  If there were \\"in between\\" categories, I would give it a 4.6, but I'll round up the rating to a 5. And happy todo so.

B0013FXWU6|5.0|Director: Paul Thomas Anderson<br />Writer: Paul Thomas Anderson, Upton Sinclair<br />Starring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Paul Dano, Dillon Freasier, Russell Harvard<br /><br />Oh, Daniel Day-Lewis, what can't you do? In yet another Oscar-winning performance, Day-Lewis plays turn of the century oil prospector Daniel Plainview. The film also won the Academy Award for best cinematography, and was nominated for best adapted screenplay, best art direction, best editing, best sound editing, best directing, and best picture.<br /><br />Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel Oil!, this movie follows our protagonist Plainview in his relentless quest for oil and riches in early 1900's California. He runs up against a young evangelical preacher who disagrees with both his motives and his methods for ravaging the land for more and more oil.<br /><br />This is one of my favorites. Everything about this film is flawless. The story, acting, visual style, characters, and music all work together so well to pull you in and take you back to oil prospecting times and make it exciting. Jonny Greenwood's music is a fantastic work of film scoring, and serves so well to underscore the story of heartbreak, hatred, and greed playing out on screen. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is one for the ages, as nearly every major review will tell you. What most reviews neglect to mention is the masterful (and criminally un-nominated) performance by Paul Dano as Eli Sunday. His character compliments Plainview's perfectly, and really puts this movie over the top for me.<br /><br />Final Score: 10/10
1401323820|5.0|While I was a little disappointed when the book arrived and it was only 198 pages long, I soon got over it.  I loved the fact that I could really picture what Rook (Castle) and Heat (Beckett) looked like all through the book.  It paralleled the show a lot, but I really liked that it did.  I actually laughed out loud a couple of times and snickered a lot.  That is my idea of a good book.  I am going to wait patiently for the next book in the series.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I'm going to saw something about Snow White you don't hear very often, it's very raw.  I don't mean its dark or raunchy, or any of the more often used understanding of raw.  I mean, it was something that was done before Disney perfected its formula for movies and animation.  The animals act as if they are sentient thinkers and such, but they do not yet talk.  The story is very basic, and in some cases don't make sense (so the queen decides to make herself the fairest of all by making herself an ugly old witch?), and thanks to the blu ray, you can see all the edges and marks of the original artwork.  The thing about something that was at one point so new and innovative as Snow White is to look at it like that.  Now, Snow White is cannon, arguably the most recognized and famous of Disney movies, but at one time it was the work of a group of film makers who were trying to do something raw and unique, and were at the threshold of inventing a new genre.      I can't fathom at how unique Snow White was when it first came out, but I can marvel at watching its majestic beauty on Blu Ray.  The print is gorgeous, as Disney Movies tend to be.  I see the clarity of the animations and music as well as the edges and markings that show the time of the animation.  It's a great presentation.  If I had a complaint, it would be the lack of all of the features of the Platinum Edition DVD.  There were a few features on the Platinum edition that are not on the Diamond Edition, most notably a pretty lengthy documentary narrated by angela langsbury.  While this isn't a killer, its worth noting.  But you don't buy Snow White for its special features, you buy it for the movie and its presentation, and this is an amazing presentation.  Recommended to anyone who has ever loved an animated film.

B00288KNL8|1.0|1. Supposedly this is supposed to be a \\"nontraditional\\" animated film... which it is.  Unfortunately, it's also a very lousy film.  First of all, it's not for kids; it's dark, it has a sarcastic view of the world, it's scary at times and it's definitely not funny.  2nd of all, it's not going to appeal to any human being of any age range, largely for the afore mentioned reasons and also because the whole plot is strange, although understandable.<br /><br />2. Again, with many films and art in general, if one wants to delude themselves that they can appreciate \\"higher art\\", then go ahead, but for the average Mr and Mrs America + 2 kids etc... do yourself a favor and skip this dud.
0061137456|5.0|(This is a review for the critique of the book \\"Howl: Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript, and Variant Versions, Fully Annotated by Author, with Contemporaneous Correspondence, Account of First Public...etc.\\", not about the book itself.)<br /><br />This book, at a whopping 208 pages, portrays the author, Allen Ginsberg in a cultural and artistic flux as both poet and as creator who's process is also in flux as well. It is also not for the feint of heart except for those who are true fans of the 4 page typewritten epic poem, Allen's first real foray at attempting what can only now be called true free-form poetry from 1956.<br /><br />The poem itself is full of life and is a ripped-open from the heart - and even his soul - portrayal of his own life; his view of his life from a mirror. This book breaks it down by the entire process - from the original typewritten version to the crossed-out edited parts, the many revisions, the \\"final\\" copies of different versions sent to friends who kept them for over 50 years (and luckily some of them, not all of them, reprinted here for the first time ever), to even letters corresponding back and forth from those same friends about it's then-impact, his subsequent secret agony in having opened up a Supreme Court type firestorm over the readings, and much much more ephemera concerning it.<br /><br />It's a lot to take in, and it can't be done in one sitting. Almost everyone from that time period chimes in - Neal Cassidy, ex-lovers, Ferlinghetti, the publishers, and writings and thoughts by Ginsberg himself, who contributed unlimited access to his own personal papers among his other \\"scraps of paper,\\" as he called them. (Sadly, Allen would never see this publication in it's final form as he died right before it was published.)<br /><br />In a way, this is the final 'version' of the poem, to explain some of the more obscure references that have been argues for years, to make sense of the motivation behind some of the now legendary passages he was thinking about when he typed it up in that dingy one room apartment over 50 years ago.<br /><br />On a personal level as a poet (I have written several chapbooks of poetry and many pieces of fiction myself), this is overwhelming. You need to be a true scholar of obscure fiction and poetry to understand the real depth and level of commitment he made when he wrote this, knowing he was standing up to over 1,000 years of structured, unassuming, harmless poetry. He was the first daredevil of poetry, daring to howl (forgive the pun) and rage against any kind formality.<br /><br />This was a new way of writing poetry, a style never really seen, and written with such honesty it surely shows. I read this, ad re-read it, I went over the several dozen revisions, read every bit of notes written and typed and edited and scratched out to friends and lovers and editors, and well, I was mentally exhausted - there is a LOT to take in, but it is worth it.<br /><br />The book is broken down into several sections, from the many drafts to the annotations, the many appendixes and correspondences to Kerouac, Carl Solomon, Ezra Pound, accounts of the first reading, the legal battles, and finally tons and tons of pictures and facsimiles of the original poem, the edits, an offhandedly snapped picture of the actual room he wrote it in, pictures of friends and lovers and friends, and much much more. It's just too much here to list, but it will be worth it for you to open it up and see for yourself.<br /><br />If and when you read this, you will come to know the very essence of Allen's spirit, his thinking process, and finally you will not only be just a reader, but you will be drawn in and become part of something that happened once in a lifetime, a groundbreaking piece of writing has finally been given the proper dissection and criticism with the respect it deserves by not only many in his own circles but but Ginsberg himself.<br /><br />In the past I've written a few special things, but nothing can come close to a poem that was written before my birth, affected First Amendment law, brought together a special kind of writing community and changed forever the way we all approach poetry, and even literature itself.<br /><br />We have one man to thank, not only for writing it, but for having the kind of support and friendship of so many others whose voices were only heard from the sidelines who supported him enough to back him when the rest of the world did not.<br /><br />This book is a living statement, of how it was originally thought out, how it was born, and how it even now lives through those who may yet read it and see for themselves that this singular poem, as a document, is as important to us as some who may revere the Liberty Bell, the Constitution and the American flag itself.<br /><br />To own this is to own a true piece of Americana itself, so do yourself a favor, pick it up, read it, and place it proudly on your shelf.<br /><br />(Thanks for reading - please check out my other hopefully not-too-syrupy critiques here on Amazon.)h, affected First Amendment law, brought together a special kind of writing community and changed forever the way we all approach poetry, and even literature itself.

0385504225|1.0|Very Disappointing. By far, the weakest of Dan Brown's books. For every five minutes of suspense, there were twenty minutes of boredom. A very weak plot and a very disappointing conclusion.
B002MW50KO|5.0|Each Christmas we enjoy our ever expanding collection of classic Christmas songs,. this addition to our collection will be played throughout the holidays for sure!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is a great selection.  Not only does the set have all years of the series, but it also has interviews with key personnel which really add to the enjoyment of the episodes.  Learning about how the lighting, music, pace and flow of the dialog work help the viewer become more involved in the episode.  Good job!
B002KVSJ64|4.0|The only problem I have is that there are too many songs that sound close to great but not great.  They should have held out a couple and put in a faster track or two, maybe used another outside source for some adding depth or difference.  Don't get me wrong the CD is overall very good but I like Phobia more.  There are too many songs that not only sound similar but have the same tempo and feel.  \\"I will not bow\\" is the fastest and best song on the CD.  If you like BB then, you'll like it but its not quite a 5 star rating and if I were producing it I would have pushed on them a little more or brought in some outside talent like they did on Phobia to make sure that the CD was nothing less then perfection.    BB is still one of the best bands around today and I hope they keep rocking for many years to come!  Worth your money but could have been a little better.  I still love BB though and will keep supporting them for sure!
B00267N3DQ|5.0|I was thrilled to find out that Disney was re-releasing Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  Who doesn't remember familiar songs like \\"Hi ho, Hi ho, it's off to work I go?\\"  Who can resist those adorable seven dwarfs?  It was fun to introduce my daughter to all these great characters that I grew up with.<br /><br />The new DVD/Blu-ray combo is outstanding.  This is Snow White like I have never see her!  I was blown out the water with the great graphics and outstanding quality picture.  The songs and storyline of course have not changed but the picture has!<br /><br />My favorite part of this new collection besides the outstanding picture was the new, never before seen Bonus Features.  It was incredible to walk through the making of Snow White with Walt Disney himself.  You could literally spend hours going through this incredible remaking of Snow White.  The bonus features allow you to walk through Disney's world in a new but magical way.<br /><br />This is definitely a great addition to your library if you have a Blu-ray player and if you do not, the picture is still incredible on the DVD portion of the collection.

B0025KVLTC|5.0|I think Revolver was The Beatles' best album in my humble opinion.  Many regard Sgt. Pepper's as their greatest but I feel that album is overrated.  Revolver has that edge that I feel is not found at Sgt. Pepper's.

0394800184|3.0|One of the many wonderful books in the \\"Cat in the Hat\\" Beginner Book series.  The story arch is simple and clear, a baby bird loses his mother right before hatching and sets up to find her.  While his mother is out searching for the baby's first meal the bird finds many unsuitable candidates (cats, cows, construction vehicles) to ask \\"Are you my mother?\\".  The illustrations are simple and sweet.  While not the best of the Seuss imprinted books (the better ones being many of the ones written by Theodore Geisel - Dr. Seuss - himself) [[ASIN:0394800133 One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish (I Can Read It All by Myself)]][[ASIN:0394800168 Green Eggs and Ham (I Can Read It All by Myself Beginner Books)]] - it is still a great book for moms to enjoy with kids at reading time.  My husband gave me this book for mother's day with my child's paint filled handprints in the front cover.  That is the perfect use for this book.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|I'm giving this record five stars because what else could you give Sgt. Peppers? It's one of the most amazing achievements in pop/rock music. But we all know that, right? What I wanted to comment on is the remastering. I sat down and went back and forth between the older and remastered versions of Peppers and some things immediately jumped out at me. Paul's bass is much crisper and more present. And since his bass playing is usually very interesting (I mean that in a good way - he doesn't play the ordinary lines one would expect), that's a real plus. Vocals are also more crisp and present. But I do think that these differences are not the sort of thing you'd notice on listening to the album in a casual way. So that raises the question for me - one I'm still dealing with - as to whether it's really worth it to replace my entire Beatles collection with the new remastered cds. I'm still not sure since, as a huge Beatles fan I want only the best sound I can get from these guys, but as a consumer who doesn't want to spend money without really getting something I will really value for it, I'm not sure whether these remastered discs are better enough to warrant the extra expense. Sorry to be so inconclusive, but I write this just because I imagine a lot of Beatles fans are wrestling with the same question. As of now, I've resolved to get one new remastered disc each month and see if I stay motivated to keep buying more. So, we'll see.
1569242739|5.0|I love this book, and have used it several times over. My daughter's first birthday just passed, and I used these recipes to make a 3 layer cake, and it worked out great. Also in addition to that, when I used to work at Starbucks, I wow'ed everyone with the chai cupcakes (99% of the people that worked at my store were omnivores) and they had no idea that they were vegan. And I also made some pumpkin spice cupcakes (I had a whole can of pumpkin I had to get rid of, I think my husband is getting sick of it) This book is great for an indulgence every once in a while, or even if you want to make some vegan treats or cakes, as the recipes also work out as well as cakes(I used the golden vanilla cupcake recipe in a round 9\\" pan)

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Well, once again we have the clever, intrepid Professor, his attractive female sidekick, a crazed, wacko religious freak, and a plethora of arcane symbols and mysteries stashed in various pyramids, buildings and books.      Although embrassingly smilar to the Da Vinci Code, there are good characters and plot twists and surprises to hold one's interest.  Unfortunately there is an excess of weak science and tortured philosophy that may appeal to those who are gullible and deluded anough to believe in soul-weighing machines, telekinesis, and the power of collective thought.  (Hopefully al qaeda never figures out how to use the last one on us).  As for the fantasy that there are ancient mysteries that would reveal profound knowledge about the universe and the human condition, the human endeavor called Science reveals such mysteries on a daily basis.  You don't have to seek them at the bottom of ancient stairways.  You can read about them regularly in Discover magazine.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|I was expecting so much more from this album, it's okay because there are atleast three songs you can listen to.<br /><br />Whatever it takes (Bonus track), a good song for Buble's voice and the arrangement is great.<br /><br />You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You, again a ballad that suits Buble's voice and his style.<br /><br />Haven't met you yet, original song, upbeat and suits his style.<br /><br />The rest of the songs are just blah.<br /><br />Cry me a river, the james bond theme type song was too much and just not right.<br />All of me, not memorable<br />Georgia on my mind, this version is horrible, Buble's timing seems off making the song slow to a boring crawl<br />Stardust was okay, but this is a really old standard and he does not give it anything special<br />Baby (you've got what it takes), Elvis can do this song justice, Buble, Not<br />Crazy love was just blah<br />Hold me, another blah<br /><br />This really is a two and a half star album, he needs to really rethink his song choices.
B000VR824S|5.0|Another primo collection of guitar \\"gunslingers\\" that anyone who is serious about their music must have in his/her collection. I never thought it was possible to create anything better than the Crossroads 04 recorded at the Cotton Bowl (another \\"must have\\" DVD), but this one out of Chicago is truly awesome. Just wait 'til you hear who steals the show from Jeff Beck with her incredible bass performance.
B000BHN7DE|4.0|The CD is great.  Every song has its own personality and that makes the entire CD very diverse.  I especially love the mixes on the second disc.
B002MW50KO|1.0|Maybe I have been listening to many quality musicians recently and that's why this sounds so bad?!! I'm not sure where anyone involved in this project was going with this product, it seems rather comical. I admire Bob Dylans body of work though I never thought of him as a singer, but as an interpreter of his historic work.<br />I hope the proceeds exceed to feeding the hungry because after hearing this, I feel like throwing up!
0307346617|5.0|When I first heard of this book I thought it would be a trashy sci-fi novel looking to capitalize on the current resurgence in the popularity of zombies. I thought, though, that it might be kinda funny to read through and it got reviews AND I honestly had nothing better to do than read it (honestly. I had just taken the Bar exam and was waiting for my results and was unemployed).     Man. Was I wrong.     Max Brooks is a fantastic writer. His writing is effortlessly compelling. His use of dialog does not merely reach the reader but paints the scene and places the reader right in the middle.     There were nights that I would read this book and I couldn't get to sleep because I was so scared! There were other nights I read this book and couldn't sleep because I was filled with excitement and pride over the triumph of the human spirit. All of this from not only a work of fiction but from zombies.     Zack is back and Max proves it.
B002KAOSGU|5.0|Wonderfully read by the author, who easily could have been a successful audio book reader even if he did not write with such involvement.  And his writing is involving, often engrossing, and his characters become friends we care for.  I am stunned whenever some tragedy befalls one.  As Mr. Gaiman said himself in his epilog, this tale is akin to Princess Bride, albeit more mature, and is awash with themes and plots of mythos quality.
B0025KVLS8|5.0|I have to be honest, I haven't sat down and listened to this album on my home stereo, with headphones.  It sounds good, but I don't think I need to buy the entire \\"remastered\\" set.  I don't see a really big deal listening to it with head phones on my computer.  But, if you think it sounds better, then to you it does.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|This movie is now nearly forty years old, but it remains the standard for depicting Japan's attack on the United States fleet based in Pearl Harbor.  Unlike other films, Tora, Tora, Tora sticks to its main point throughout its run time.  The film is critical of the United States' commanders who disregarded evident warning signs of the impending attack and shows also how difficult is was for brass in Washington, thousands of miles away, to relay their concerns to the fleet in Hawaii.    Honolulu in 1941 was a sleepy outpost and not the modern tourist center it is today.  As a result, the military base was the biggest show in town.  This was America's most important base in the Pacific, but too many people failed to prvide it the security needed for such an imporant base.  Japan was able to position its fleet within striking distance without detection as no American naval patrols were assigned to circle the islands looking for potential threats.  Radar operators picked up the attacking planes but their warnings were ignored by their superiors.    Tora, Tora, Tora admits the flaws not only in the American defenses, but also in the flaws of Japan's attack plans.  Though the attack on Pearl harbor was more or less a \\"surprise,\\" it did not achieve the immobilization of the American aircraft carriers.  It also did not deliver the knockout blow Japan anticipated.  Isolationists in America, including many congressmen, would not allow the country to fully prepare for war and Japan banked on this anti0war sentiment to carry the day for their plans.  Unfortunately for Japan, they did awaken the sleeping giant that Admiral Yamamoto pondered at the film's end.    This film is well directed and has an allstar cast.  The attack scenes are very well done and even the more recent film \\"Pearl Harbor\\" cannot really do more to show the destruction of much of the fleet within the harbor.  The acting is done well by all the characters and the film moves at a pace that is both informativeand to the point.  It will take quite an effort to knock this movie off of its lead rank as the definitive Hollywood depiction of the attack of December 7, 1941.
0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown does not disappoint in this new action thriller. I loved the mysticism, the science, the history and of course, the plot and characters... I loved everything about the book (that is except the need to stay up way too late reading rather than sleeping of course). After reading several other authors who I felt needed an editor to shorten their books by about 200 pages, it was truly a pleasure reading a book whose words and pages consistently urged me forward wanting more. Now that I finished the book, the biggest problem is waiting for the next one.
0393061310|3.0|I've read some of the negative reviews and would like to say something about a repeating assertion that the Incas only had two crops, potatos and maize (corn). The Incas cultivated around seventy crops, including grains, beans and fruits. More, in fact, than any other region in the world. Their conquerers were only interested in a few of them and those are the ones we know about. Among the better known crops are lima beans, peppers, peanuts, sweet potatos, squash, quinoa and tomatoes. Salsa is an Incan original. There are also reviewers who claim the natives of Mexico grew mostly maize. Their agriculture was pretty diverse too.
0446615625|1.0|It is now a week and a half after the estimated delivery date and I have not received my book nor have I heard from the seller.

0345444051|5.0|This has to be one of my all-time favorite science fiction books.  Arthur C. Clarke is a master at identifying and portraying humanity's deepest fears and loftiest desires. This end time tale is crafted magnificently, and is a must-read for today. Easy to read, suspenseful, well-developed, and with just that right touch of mysticism, human psychology combined with solid science. How and when will mankind evolve, and what will it mean to humanity as we know it today? Highly recommend!

B002KDUDG6|5.0|I love this new music from Michael Buble.  Mike provides a range of emotions here.  My favorite track is the upbeat \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\". Mike gets some help on the accapela track \\"Stardust\\" from the group Naturally 7.  This song is very relaxing.  Mike duets with Sharon Smith and the Dap Kings on the song \\"Baby You've Got It Takes\\".  This is a very groovy tune.  I like the guitar playing featured on the song \\"Crazy Love\\". Mike shows his romantic side on the song \\"At This Moment\\".  Mike covers the Ray Charles classic well.  The piano playing is superb here.  I love the big band sound of \\"Cry Me A River\\".  Mike sounds so dramatic here. I love the sound of All I Do Is Dream Of You.  This song makes me feel good.  The smooth sound of \\"Whatever It Takes\\" is very soothing.  Mike duets with a singer named Ron Sexsmith on this song.  He has a good voice.  \\"Hold On\\" is a new song and a nice surprise.  This is Michael's best work.
B002K0WBYG|5.0|Ok, the premise is a bit of a reach. But honestly, the movie is good enough that you don't notice at all. The main stars give a really good performance in this truely funny story. The film is very well done, and if you are looking for a comedy, you will not be disappointed with this one.

B0021L8US0|2.0|Ok, I grant that all the material for a great movie is there: Good acting, great & innovative camera work, awesome CGI, and an interesting topic. However, they didn't do anything with it. I have read the reviews, but haven't yet come across anyone who knows what the heck this film is about. Ok, it is well made....but a well made what? They seem to randomly start in the middle of the story, go really nowhere, then end the film. I just don't get it. Are we supposed to simpatize with the aliens while they are ripping off the limbs of humans, making weapons, and turning humans into aliens? Was that the point? Are we supposed to cheer that one alien was able to leave on a ship that carried tens of thousands, stranding the rest here?     I feel nothing for this fim but sadness that such acting, camera, and CGI work went into a film that did nothing and made no sense at all. Someone please tell me why was this film made...what was it about?
B002KVSJ64|4.0|Huge Breaking Benjamin fan, long time listener.  In short, I definitely expected something more for having taken so long.  Having said that, they stick true to their style and the album is definitely solid.  The first three songs are hands down the top 3 on this album.  The rest is a mix of softer, slower rock riffs with expanded lyrical performances by Ben and shorter, edgier sounds.  Unfortunately, several of the songs past the top 3 sound a heck of a lot alike.  Every song on this album is a solid one though.  \\"Crawl\\" is to \\"I Will not Bow\\" what \\"Breath\\" was to \\"Diary of Jane\\" and if it's not the next single off of this album, radio people are insane.  For the casual rocker- worth the money, but not much more.
B002MW50KO|1.0|I like Bob Dylan. A major influence on songwriting. But this is going to far.  Over the line. Off the edge. I heard some clips from this release on NPR this  morning and I refuse to listen to any more of this...stuff. To me, Christmas carols are a precious reminder of a pretty good childhood I was blessed with - his scratchy, gravelly, rough voice has no business shredding these wonderful tunes. Bad marketing decision, IMHO. No way would I have one of these discs - even if they PAID me.
B00275EGTC|5.0|That's right ladies and gentlemen. The deservedly critically acclaimed low-budget/high quality science fiction film will be released on DVD in Great Britain in November and in the U.S.A in January. Here's what the British release has announced for the DVD:    - 2.40:1 Anamorphic Widescreen  - English Dolby Digital 5.1  - English and Hindu subtitles  - Two commentaries with Director Duncan Jones on other production staff members  - \\"Whistle\\" a short sci-fi film made by Duncan Jones back in 2000.   - Documentary \\"The Making of Moon\\"  - Documentary \\"Creating the Visual Effects\\"  - Science Center Q&A with Director Duncan Jones  - Filmmaker's Q&A at the Sundance Film Festival    The Blu-Ray release has a few extras not on DVD that make it worthwhile. You get all the stuff from the DVD, plus:    - 1080p 2.40:1 Anamorphic Widescreen  - Italian and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1  - Italian and Spanish subtitles  - Featurette \\"How Did They Do That: Cloning Sam\\"  - Concept Art Library    No announcements for TrueHD or any other high definition audio (still Dolby Digital is nothing to sneeze at), but you never know. As for if the U.S. release will be the same as the British release I see no reason why it wouldn't considering how incredibly easier it would be to port that release (aside from changing the region code) than to produce a completely different compilation. Keep an eye out for announcements around the holidays, folks. The movie that is a truly amazing achievement will be coming soon to a home near you.
B002S0OBFK|5.0|The premise is simple: a pleasant, good-natured woman has been haunted by a supernatural being for most of her life. Her boyfriend, who is the type of guy who thinks he can contend with an otherworldly entity simply because he's hyped up on testosterone, wants to get the creepy details on tape. So he buys an expensive camera, sets up a tripod in their bedroom, and endlessly records their nocturnal activities in hopes of illuminating exactly what is happening to his girlfriend. Unfortunately, this very conceit seems to upset the malevolent trickster stalking her, and results in an escalation of the being's involvement. At one point, the boyfriend yells, \\"Is that all you got?\\" and consequently, the demon more than rises to the challenge.       The genius of \\"Paranormal Activity\\" (besides it's reported $11,000 budget), is that it leaves much to the imagination. Like \\"Blair Witch Project\\", it never shows exactly what is obsessed with the woman, and for people with fertile imaginations, the unknown becomes frightening. \\"Paranormal\\" removes the shaky camera work that many found distracting in \\"Blair Witch\\", but the grainy, black/white photography is chilling and gives the film an aura of authenticity. The luminous glow creating a surreal halo around the master bedroom is akin to the strobelight flashing through the darkness in the eerie Maryland woods of \\"Blair Witch\\". And like \\"Blair\\", the majority of the action takes place in the dead of night, making one dread the arrival of dusk. I actually felt a tingly prickling at the back of my neck when the automated timer clicked to 2:00 a.m. and the ominous rumble-buzz appeared, signaling the arrival of the mischievous demon.       Part of what is so scary about \\"Paranormal\\" is that it seems like it could really happen. Gore is kept to a minimum, and the excruciating pauses play like reality. Details are intriguing and well-developed. The boyfriend keeps taunting the demon, trying to up the ante, and the demon seeks payback. Both characters are sympathetic, and the director keeps ratcheting up the tension as the two get more and more stressed, to the point of anger and hysteria. She wants the horrifying events to end; he simply wants to be in control and get them on tape. Purchasing a ouja board might be the last straw, inviting the demon in so it can wreak havoc on their lives. One wonders if the boyfriend had been less obnoxious, maybe the demon wouldn't have felt a need to invade their home in such relentless, aggressive fashion.       The actors/actresses are excellent. The boyfriend is cocky and feels like he needs to challenge the demon to show his loyalty. His girlfriend acts reasonably despite being battered with fear. I loved the part when the ghost expert steps into the house and immediately retreats, sensing that the entity is bristling and doesn't want him in the house. Unlike the priest in \\"The Exorcist\\", this man is intimidated and feels his presence will only enrage the demon.       The true emotional impact of \\"Paranormal Activity\\" would be seeing it alone, in a gloomy room, in total silence. The showing I attended was packed, and many audience members ruined the spooky tone by yelling inane comments at the screen. \\"Oh, HELL NO!\\" and \\"GET THE *BLEEP* OUTTA THAT PLACE!\\" were common helpful suggestions shouted by aspiring comedians. Despite this commentary, the movie still raised my hackles and kept my eyes glued to the screen, searching for inspired details that added heft to the story. If creative indie script writers can continue molding brilliant thrillers out of virtually nothing, the future of modern horror films looks promising.
B001CC7PKS|1.0|The graphics on bluray remind me of the video games from the mid 90's like the origional doom games and quake.<br />The graphics of the 6th sense he has sickend me to my core.<br />The extra film in the directors cut selfshows why it had been cut in the first place; BECAUSE 90% OF IT HARMED THE FLOW OF THE STORY! some extra scenes even made the comic hero more comedic then heroic.<br />If you liked the movie in theaters and dvd, i pray and beg you dont get it in Blu and make the mistake i sadly did.
B00005MP58|5.0|You could never had found a better movie then this.. i fell in love with it.. not only was Jane Austen a master of a novelist.. But the chariters were superb.. jane , and Elizabeth Jenneifer Ehle was excellant for the part played it amazing.. and Colin firth as Darcy was a master piece he was a wonderful acter and seeing the smile at the end of the movie was priceless. and his best friend with jane was perfect.. loved it.. andrew davies is a master when it comes to his movies ... its a timeless classic beautifully done.. And even though Jane Austen is gone she still lives on in her books and the movies that have been made.. Had she been from this generation her creations would probably be life changing to movies and books like it was for the 19th century..

People who HATE this film just don't get the message and shouldn't be posting ratings negatively influencing others. However, everyone IS welcome to comment  - its just a shame some might be influenced , but I guess those people shouldn't buy this anyways ! ;-)  If you have an ounce of intelligence (and  can take gore..) and appreciate the dry humor and sarcasm of film - this is a must buy !!!!
B002LLDTA4|5.0|This is not a review of a legendary concert appearance by Leonard Cohen.<br /><br />It's a meditation on personal power. His. Yours. Mine.<br /><br />Essentially, I'm trying to figure out here what happens below the surface of your life so you can --- how you access your power for career advancement, personal gain and, not least, the good of the world.<br /><br />But to do that, I have to tell you a Leonard Cohen story and urge you to watch a 64-minute documentary.<br /><br />Here's the story.<br /><br />In l967, 32-year-old Leonard Cohen --- a novelist and poet who was just starting out as a singer/songwriter --- walked onstage at Carnegie Hall, looked out at the audience, and started shaking. \\"I can't do this,\\" he said, and left the stage. In the wings, Judy Collins took his hand, led him in front of the audience again and sang \\"Suzanne\\" with him.<br /><br />In 1970, 35-year-old Leonard Cohen agreed to perform at England's Isle of Wight music festival. It was not a happy event. Angered that there was a wall to keep out those who hadn't paid, some of the young festivalgoers rebelled. They tore down fences. They crashed the gates. There were fires and fights. There was garbage.<br /><br />600,000 people. Living outside. For almost five days.<br /><br />At 2 in the morning of the fifth and final day, Leonard Cohen was awakened and asked to hurry onstage. There was no piano, no organ. Cohen, in his pajamas, insisted on both. And then he went back to his trailer to get dressed.<br /><br />At 4 in the morning, Cohen took the stage. He looked into the darkness and, gently, slowly, told a story of going to the circus as a kid and liking only the moment when the audience lit matches in the darkness. He asked the crowd to light matches, and he waited while they did, and then he sang \\"Bird on a Wire.\\"<br /><br />And he owned that crowd. He held 600,000 souls in the palm of his hand, and he brought them his brave, sad songs, and they listened to him as if he were a prophet.<br /><br />This amazing footage is the start of the 64-minute concert DVD that is half of the package. (The other half is a CD of Cohen's performance. If you are a Leonard Cohen fan, it's of minor interest; if you're new to Cohen, it's even less interesting.)<br /><br />Here's my question: On that stage, Leonard Cohen was in a state of calm beyond calm. What occurred in those three years to give him that outrageous certainty in himself? How did the transformation occur?<br /><br />And then, to make it personal, can I do that? Can you?<br /><br />I can only hazard a guess here. But it strikes me that, at Carnegie Hall, Cohen stuck a toe in the water of live performance. And he saw that it didn't kill him, that it pleased him and raised him up, bringing him closer to the self he imagined. And he followed it with another step, and another, until 600,000 people were no big deal.<br /><br />That's a very crude formulation. It doesn't deal at all with doubts and fears, with backsliding; it makes Cohen into a mythic figure, a terminator, resolutely moving forward. I doubt it happened that smoothly for him. I suspect there was a lot of determination involved, and picking himself up when he faltered. But I think the steadiness of the effort served him well --- after a while, he was in a new place, and when he looked back, he didn't recognize his old, fearful self.<br /><br />It's what Anne Lamott writes in \\"Bird by Bird\\". Her brother had to write a school report about birds. The kid couldn't figure out a way to do it. But their father did. \\"Bird by bird, buddy,\\" he said.<br /><br />You want to see how far you can get if you keep at it? Look at \\"Leonard Cohen Live in London\\", captured last year, when Cohen was 75. Or just go to the music. What you get is the same thing again and again --- Cohen pays total attention, he's completely in the moment, and soon you are. He tunes you, just as he tuned the 600,000 in 1970s.<br /><br />One of the mottoes of the Texas Rangers is this: \\"Little man whip a big man every time if the little man's in the right and keeps on coming.\\" I have trouble believing that; the streets of history are littered with the corpses of little men who didn't grasp how cruel the powerful can be. But I think Cohen believes it, and I think that simple belief made the difference. And in watching his remarkable 1970 performance, I do rediscover my courage.ory are littered with the corpses of little men who didn't grasp how cruel the powerful can be.

B001EN71DQ|1.0|EDIT DEC 2010 - I couldnt wait for \\"Episode 1\\" to come out, I love the Star Wars universe and really wanted to see the \\"foundation\\" for the original 3 movies. I was very disappointed with it, and more so with Attack of the Clones. These new movies rely to heavily on CGI and showing off lightsabers than they do on an entertaining story. Most of the characters are hard to relate to, and especially in Phantom menace. Anakin especially, the supposed hero of the prequels, is completely unrelatable, and seems to go out of his way to be unlikable. Not much happens in the way of character development and storyline in the first two prequels, except in the political motives that lead the way to the Empire, they REALLY cover that end of the story. In Phantom Menace they find Anakin, in Clones he falls in love with Padme, thats it. The look of the movies are different from the look of the original 3, everything is new, it doesnt have that used look that the previous ones had, the droids move fluidly, and dont have that feeling that they could be a real machine, like 3po and r2 did in the originals. All the ships constantly change in the movies, as a combination of ships that will appear in the original 3. This was clearly done as an excuse to sell merchandise, because it doesnt seem likely that any military will change their ships so many times in such a short period of time, I guess the empire has a pretty big budget. The heavy use of CGI is what gets me the most, you can tell everything that is done with CGI, so, you loose connection to the characters, because your brain knows its an actor on wires jumping around in some computer animated background or some computer animated guy and completely disconnects you from any emotion towards the character or scenario. I liked Revenge of the Sith as far as storyline goes, that was the movie I wanted to watch, how Anakin became Vader. These movies dont have that original Star Wars feel to them, its just a flashy string of events that happens in a universe related to the one from the original 3.       ORIGINAL POST; These movies are terrible. Yoda looks like a short Shrek with a light saber. They made these movies with 3 actors and everything else is CGI. I was waiting for Woody and Buzz Lightyear to pop out. The story on the first two were completely useless, you could have told that entire story in 1 movie. The 3rd one was slightly better because it actually tells the story everyone wanted to see, how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, and you get to see Darth Vader for 1 whole minute. The first movie you get to see some kid accidentally saving a planet, and in the second a whining teenager rolling in the hills with Padme. These movies established 2 things, Jar-jar sucked, and Anakin is that kid in high school everyone makes fun of.

I think it would have been a little better if they could have had Arnold in it someway beside the little computer generated version of him for a couple of seconds. As far as how McG is releasing this on DVD, I am not happy. Where is the 2 disc special edition for DVD? I don't have a Blu-Ray player, and I don't plan on buying one anytime soon, but I like to get the special editions of movies on the DVD. Every other big movie this year has a 2 disc special edition on DVD, but not Terminator, WHY? I was really looking forward to the extend version that McG had talked about, and in the beginning he did say he was making a special edition for DVD, but not when release time actually came around. I guess I will have to deal with regular movie.

B0015XWUCC|5.0|I've been a fan of David Bowie's music since the late 60's when his creative, unmistakable and unique sound first hit the music scene. Although I don't like all of his music, for the most part I think he's aged like a very fine bottle of wine. He is without a doubt a creative genius who has never been afraid to enter new areas of music and has never rested on his past successes. In my opinion his album Reality from 2003 (which I purchased about 1 year ago) is without a doubt one of his finest works, perhaps his best since Station to Station. I probably listen to this album more often than any other album or cd I own, and I own roughly 1,250 albums and cds including all of the Beatles and most of Bruce Springsteen's works. If you enjoy listening to David Bowie and for whatever reason you havn't listened to Reality yet you owe it to yourself to buy this marvelous cd. You will not be dissapointed!
B0026NWBY2|5.0|This remastered collection is way overdue.  All of the songs are great and the lesser known ones are a real surprise in terms of quality.  George is the ex-Beatle who improved the most vocally.  He became a very expressive singer as the years rolled on.  George was also a very under-rated guitar player.  Never flashy, he always played with restraint and feeling and never wasted a note.  I always enjoyed the way he would bend a key note one-half step higher than most other guitar players to give a riff that extra flavor.  He didn't start playing slide until his solo career and he turned out to be one of the best rock slide guitarists ever.  Although the songs on this collection are consistently strong, it's still missing some key cuts such as \\"If Not For You\\", \\"You\\", etc.  I am somewhat disappointed with the packaging.  It would have been more appropriate to have recording dates, release dates, and chart information listed for each song.  However, this is an essential and highly recommended collection of Harrison's solo material.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I must say I was a bit apprehensive, after hearing him preform Haven't Met You Yet, on the Today show.I'm not crazy about that track. The rest of the CD is great!  I love his voice on the remakes of songs from The Brat Pack era:) My favorite track of the CD though, has to be the remake of At This Moment. As a fan of the original, this one does not disappoint!! I will enjoy listening to this over and over !

B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic is one of the best albums of all time!!! Nas is a true poet,and his lyrics are sick. This album is hip-hop in it's truest form. My favorite songs on this album is \\"represent\\" and \\"The world is yours.\\" I miss music like this people, music that means something and you sit through a whole album without skipping to a next song. You can sit through an album and just vibe nodding your head. Nas to me is one of the greatest rappers of all time. If you dont believe me people, listen to the lost tapes album by Nas. I reccomend this album to everyone, Illmatic is an example of the essence of hip hop.

B000001GK9|5.0|You wouldn't know it to read some of these \\"reviews\\", but this is about sublime art, not a talent contest.    I am no Mahlerite. My half-century of avid listening has tended to avoid the late Romantics in favour of the Baroque, the Classical, the early Romantic, Impressionism and beyond, including non-European music. I can think of one important exception. In my youth I owned a copy of the Mengelberg/Concertgebouw Mahler's fourth to which I often turned for consolation when the world was closing in. As it does.    But let me get to the point. This Karajan/Berlin Mahler's ninth is as powerful and astonishing as any recording I've ever owned.     I have seen a review of this 1982 program (albeit from a different evening) from the contemporaneous issue of New York magazine. The reviewer, incredibly, opined that, as impressive as the live performance was from every imaginable technical aspect, it somehow failed to \\"touch the heart.\\"     God knows where the reviewer's heart was that evening, that it remained untouchable. To be fair, perhaps the orchestra had a sub-par evening. Such things happen to traveling orchestras.    But speaking for myself, I have been playing this CD every morning and evening for three days now, and it keeps unfolding and drawing from me new feelings of pity, joy, tragedy, ecstasy, resignation and transcendance.    Please ignore if possible all the irrelevant gossip about Karajan's arrogance, or the silly games about \\"the best\\" this, that or the other, and open your heart and intellect to this astonishing music, that speaks to us (in Karajan's words) \\"from another world\\".

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I hadn't seen Snow White since the 1983 theatrical re-release...went as a kid with my grandparents and loved it...that alone made me really misty. My older daughter (3) is a carbon copy of Snow White, so I was eager to have her see the movie. She's now begging to watch Snow White instead of Ariel and Cinderella (love them too, but there's nothing like Snow White). I really choked up when she told me how beautiful she was. I opted to wait for this re-release (vs buy a used version of the prev Platinum edition). I am so glad I bought the Diamond Edition Blu-Ray - the picture quality is stunning and the sound is so crisp and clear. It also gives you viewing options- while watching it in the original 1937 format is great- I  really like the DisneyVision with the paintings filling in the black spaces. The side paintings of the velvet red theater curtains on our big screen really made it feel like our own little movie theater. While previous platinum edition Disney movies are excellent (and we have quite a few)- the picture and sound of this one is definitely superior. Total Thumbs Up!!!    ****2 notes- 1) for whatever reason, Amazon is lumping in reviews for the prev. released platinum edition of this movie (vs the current diamond ed.). Sure, it's the same movie, but the diamond edition wasnt released until Oct 2009- so if you're trying to decide about the diamond edition BluRay- ignore all comments prior to this Oct 2009 release date 2) I've seen a number of reviews bashing the storyline. It's a fairytale and unless you've been hiding under a rock- you know the basic story and variations. i.e. I know the story of Rapunzel, but if Disney were to make an animated feature of it- it would be insane to bash it for having a predictable story. That's just how animated features of long standing fairy tales work!
0385504225|2.0|I've read every Dan Brown book and eagerly snapped this one up on day one. Sorry, have to say, what a disappointment. It has none of the punch, excitement and cliff hanging story that his other books have had. I can honestly say you never have to worry about when to put the book down for a break. There's an opportunity at every page. Reads like a metaphysical schoolbook filled with confusing jargon and unless you are a real devotee of the Masons and their mystical history you'll be lost.
0385737947|4.0|PRO:<br />This is one of those books that grabbed me from the beginning.<br />The entire concept of being stuck in a maze that changes at night and has some \\"monsters\\" in it, is a good one and delivered well.<br /><br />I felt like I was reliving season 1 of Lost, where mystery upon mystery are presented and I can't wait to find out if any answers will be provided. It was this mystery that kept me turning pages.<br /><br />Due to the injustice of the situation we have a natural sympathy/empathy for the characters.<br /><br />What normally makes a reader care about a character and not think them as one- or two-dimensional is the character's background and how those experiences have shaped them into who they are today and why they are reacting the way they are today. But this story is unique, in that none of the characters know anything of their past. Their entire past is however long they've been stuck in the Maze.<br /><br />Even without the main tool of backstory, I felt like I knew several of the characters and was rooting for several of them to succeed.<br /><br />CON:<br />My 11 year old kept asking when would I be done so he could read the book and I kept telling him ,\\"Soon.\\" But by the end of the book some graphic violence happens that isn't in the rest of the book. Some out of control violence, that I'm not sure I want him reading. . .so be warned if this is an issue for you or your young person who may want to read this.<br /><br />The book ends as a cliff hanger!! Please realize that regardless of the title Amazon gives it,  this is not the entire trilogy, but it's only the first part.<br /><br />I really liked the first 75%, but wasn't satisfied with the end and felt like parts were rushed in order to wrap up the book. Thus, I wish I could have waited for the entire series come out and see how book 3 is rated. You may want to do this too.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />Great start then a rushed \\"ending\\". I like the concept enough and the macro plot that is hinted at that I may read the 2nd installment, whenever it finally makes an appearance. I almost have to keep reading the series, otherwise I'll have felt like my time reading this book was lost in a maze of its own with no way out.d at that I may read the 2nd installment, whenever it finally makes an appearance.

B002KVSJ64|4.0|I've been a BB fan for some years now. When I saw the video release of their single \\"I Will Not Bow\\" on the site for the movie \\"Surrogates\\" I was immediately excited. I had no idea that they were releasing a new album though I knew they were due for one. I am very pleased with this album. I can listen to it from start to finish no problem. I do see some room where they could have taken more risks but maybe it's better to be on the safer side since they've finally broken through the ceiling into major mainstream rock. I think with their next one they could afford to be risky again. Still a strong album though that truly does not disappoint.
B000FC1K66|5.0|Seldom have I read a book that seemed so simple on the surface, but remained in my mind so long as I peeled away layer after layer of complexity like peeling an onion. I'll leave the debate to others; for me, The Reader was one of those books you surrender to and allow the author to lead you down passageways both light and dark.    I finished The Reader on a Sunday evening. It's now Wednesday and the characters of Michael and the doomed Hanna remain at the edges of my consciousness. My inner debate still rages over their actions. I have no doubt but that it will for a long time to come.    Thank you, Bernhard Schlink, for such an extraordinary book ... a book that uses a simple story to shine the light on moral and ethical complexities.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|The down side - I have carried a Sterling Superior Sharpener on my keyring for years.  The Pocket Pal is about 4x as thick, so is bulkier in your pocket.    The up side - The Pocket Pal does a MUCH better job.  My EDC SAK had gotten rather dull.  30 sec to 1 Minute later it was quite sharp.  Sure, there are systems to get a blade razor sharp, and this isn't one.  But considering time, effort and cost, I've never seem better.    The verdict - Right now my Sterling is on the coffee table for me to put away with the spares.  The Pocket Pat is on my keyring in the pocket.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Its pretty simple. There are 2 kinds of people in this world. Those who love Lost and those who say \\"when are they getting off that island\\". Most people who dislike Lost have not watched every episode. If you miss episodes then yea... your going to be Lost, pardon the pun. In my opinion Lost is the greatest TV show ever. Consistant quality from episode 1 to season 5's finale.

0061719544|5.0|I was spellbound, I never dreamed Craig has come so far. He could have been a total failure, but his good sense and good wit brought him up from the depths of hell. I commend him, and want to tell him, he definitely is not a \\"douche bag\\". He is my hero, I love you Craig..
0446619078|5.0|As an avid reader I jump from author to author, genre to genre, fiction to non-fiction, searching for the elusive good read. Fiction writers who write interesting tales sometimes skew their facts or lines of probability while academics, at times, tend to take interesting topics and make them less so. Not always, but it happens.<br />  Occasionally though, you get the gifted writer who makes a book- any book- ring. Such is what I found with Michael Connelly's THE LAST COYOTE. It not only rings, it resonates.<br />  Read the reviews here and see why. And if you write a review just don't get excited and give away the plot. Let others discover it as well.<br />  It is easy to see why Connelly has legions of fans and I suppose I count myself as one because in between other books I toss in a Michael Connelly book to remind myself on why I enjoy a good story. Also, I liked the suble way he promoted The Neon Rain by James Lee Burke, another of my favorite authors. Connelly has style.
0517548232|5.0|This book in no way should be read by any 'progressive' who wishes to remain one! If you read with any openmindedness at all, you will be moved inexorably toward an appreciation of the ability of the free market to improve the lives of people in any society that values and practices it. Your faith in government to solve economic problems will be shattered as you begin to see how non-market 'solutions', no matter how well intended, exacerabate these problems in the real world.     Written over 60 years ago, Hazlitt's work is remarkably prescient and applicable today. Along with very relatable examples, I found his reasoning to be clear, concise, and sound. It is very readable and understandable for non-economists. Seems the economic fallicies that people mistakenly believe today are essentially the same ones from 1946, or 1846, or 1746...or for that matter... from 46. Just slap a new coat of paint on 'em and your ready to fool a whole new generation of victims. In this respect, Hazlitt makes a great paint stripper.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|I forgot how enjoyable it was to sing to these songs since you don't hear them on the radio anymore.  I do miss the old scratchy sound since they really adjusted the quality of the songs.  My mind still remembers the way they used to sound.  I like the photo booklet that comes with the CD and the cute little movie of the Beatles that appeared on my computer when I inserted the CD.  Very nice!
B0027VTMAE|3.0|The visuals are stunning, but the joke when this came out among my friends was that it had no ending.  Like the Director just ran out of ideas.  Well perhaps he'll have time to think one up now.  Meanwhile as a blu-ray transfer it is great, but blu-ray can't fix the fundamental flaw.

0061914177|4.0|This is not a wine book. It is a book from a wine phenomena. Crush It, is Gary Vay-ner-chuk's move to leveraging his social media status built up through his wine business into the Business guru status. In Crush It Gary explains his life story, his outward ways and shows how he crushed it, first in baseball cards, then in wine. He gives plenty of tips for becoming a web personality, including a 21 point plan. But the final page sums the book up:    \\"Listen to your DNA... success - financial, personal and professional- lies above all in loving your family, working hard and living your passion.\\"    Gary is not just a wine guy. He sees himself as a business man giving sagely advice from the trenches. Crush It is a punch of energy to any entrepreneur. The message is delivered with energy and passion. And it is Gary's passion as a businessman that surprised me the most. Wine is passion and a business, which is just the way it is. But it is one of his many passions: base ball cards, wine, business and social media. Crush It is true to Gary's DNA, it is open, honest and an inspiring read.    The book itself is short and most could read it in a long afternoon, though I found myself having to speed read it, to keep up with Gary's narration it has pace keeping me engaged and enjoying the read.    Crush It is part self help for those who want to be rich and famous and part insight into Gary's \\"DNA\\", as he would say. It speaks volumes about where Gary feels he is. Has he Crushed It yet? The answer is definitely yes, in the US at least. Will he crush other business, yes. Does he want you to be crushed? No. There is a lot of crushing and nobody gets hurt. Orange juice anybody?  An interesting wine book from a web and wine expert on how he did it. I liked it and give it 89 out of 100.    Chris Scott  ThirtyFifty
0446608955|5.0|Landon Carter is a boy who doesn't really know God at all. When he realizes he might be the only guy in the school without a date to the homecoming dance, he pulls out his yearbook for help. For some reason, he keeps coming back to the picture of Jamie Sullivan, a plain, ultra-religious minister's daughter. A date with Jamie might earn him some ridicule, but it would be better than going stag. So he works up the nerve and asks. Jamie's answer? She says yes, on one condition. She makes him promise that he won't fall in love with her.<br /><br />Landon isn't a bit worried about falling in love with Jamie Sullivan.<br /><br />The dance goes okay. A few days later Jamie asks him a favor. She wants him to take the lead role in the play. Landon has no desire to do such a thing, but the way Jamie puts it to him, he'd be the biggest jerk on earth to say no. The more time Landon spends with Jamie, the more frustrated he gets. If she'd just try a little, she could be normal. But Jamie is anything but normal, and that's why Landon can't help but break his promise.<br /><br />This book has a couple mild curse words in it. But it is one of the best love stories I've ever read. Here is a girl who is being exactly who God created her to be. Most the kids write her off as a nerd, but Jamie is the real deal. And when a guy gets to know a girl who is real and confident and who knows who she is, that is the most attractive thing in the world. Most girls don't get that...ever. But God designed each of us to be who we are, not to pretend to be someone else. Jamie gets that. She also gets the bigger picture. That God might use her to bring others to him. This story has a heartbreaking twist, but if we can remember that we were not created for this world but for the next one, it is truly a very happy ending. I love this book!

B0000AUHPG|3.0|Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda make a story about the coming of an<br />evil railroad tycoon to Arizona.<br />Part of the movie is filmed in the John Wayne country of Monument Valley.<br />The only recognizable Italian is the leading lady, Claudia Cardinale,<br />but the film has a Sergio Leone<br />feel to the filming. In such a short period of time a revolution<br />in Hollywood had taken place and movies with Italian extras<br />shot in Italy ans Spain were no longer enough.<br />Charles Bronson is the Clint Eastwood character of the nameless man.<br />The result is pretty much a bad imitation of an Italian western?<br />Not that everybody didn't do their part, but the result just<br />doesn't have the spirit of the Eastwood films.

0061914177|5.0|From the moment I picked up the book, I couldn't put it down.  Crush-It is a must read and should be on everyone's life plan reading list.  Our local book store only had three copies and I bought all three to give my fellow associates who need to memorize Gary's teachings.  Gary, if I was a wine drinker I would toast you!  Great job.

0440246016|4.0|How confused would you be if out of nowhere, $1,100 appeared in your bank account?  Jack Reacher, the main character of Lee Child's book,Bad Luck and Trouble, knows exactly how this feels.  Reacher is a person who doesn't have a home or any belongings, except the clothes on his back, a foldable toothbrush and a bank account.  No one can connect with him because he does not have a cell phone.  He was once a member of an eight-person elite military group.  All of a sudden, someone kills one of the members of this group. The dead man's wife calls another of the group members to let her know what had happened.  It is this woman who is able to contact Reacher, by depositing money into his account.  She cleverly deposits the exact dollar amount that is the same as a special code that only this elite team knows about.  Reacher immediately knows who made the deposit.  Reacher finds her and together, they set out to capture the killer.<br /><br />The plot of this book was thrilling.  It kept me on the edge of my seat and I had a hard time putting down this phenomenal book.  The author did a great job explaining who the characters were, what their backgrounds were, and what their personalities were like.  I thought that the main character, Jack Reacher was the most interesting of all of the characters.  He was strong, intelligent and able to figure things out easily.  I loved the author's use of details.  They made it seem as if the events had really occurred and that the reader was part of the story.  It was hard to tell that the genre for this book was fiction because the events seemed so real.  The author's use of suspense at the end of each chapter grabbed me like a fish being reeled in!  Though this book was written for adults, I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy suspense and mystery.<br /><br />Nicholas L.<br />Grade 6<br />Ms. Kawatachi
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I've read three of Dan Brown's books. The Lost Symbol was a drag for me for a number of reasons.      This story should have been told in a briefer manner. Many of the minute details including at what angle cars were parked outside(as an example) a home were just tedious and superfluous.    Besides the minutia there is a maddening amount of repeated information. The one character that has tatoos and body painting has the details  of those given nearly every time the character appears in the story. It seems that the author forgot between sit downs what he had detailed in previous chapters.
0786838655|5.0|After living most of his childhood as a normal kid with normal parents, and friends, Kenny has a few odd things happen at his school. He slays his math teacher, Ms. Dodds, and however much Kenny remembers her, his best friend Grover denies that there was a Ms. Dodds. He starts getting suspicious, and just as he starts to pick up on something, school ends. His mom decides to take him on a vacation, and the weirdest thing happens: his best friend comes to the steps of his house drenched during a storm. He ends up at a very unusual summer camp, where he spends the rest of his amazing summer ... or maybe not.    After the weird incident at the museum that opens Kenny's eyes, after he needs to slay his teacher, the book just keeps on getting better. When I first started reading it, I thought that it would just be a typical book, but after the museum scene, I couldn't stop reading it. As more characters got introduced and personalities changed, it gets even better. In the end, a lot of the plot had turned, and I was amazed at how good the book had been. This will be one of the most surprising books that I ever read.    Will G.  Grade 6  Ms. Kawatachi
0439023483|5.0|Would you survive? The Hunger Games is a masterpiece of a book revolving around one universal topic: Survival. This Book is about one girl named Katniss who participates in a competition where only the winner gets to stay alive. Match this unique plot with brilliant writing by Suzanne Collins and what you get is a work of art! This is a book I will not forget. It is the ultimate page-turner with twists and turns at every chapter. Are you ready for The Hunger Games?    Rom SB 7/8
0810994739|1.0|I picked up \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules\\" because my 9 year old daughter was reading it.  While it is an easy read, and probably fairly true to life, I was appalled.  In my opinion this book has no socially redeeming value whatsoever.  It's an endless series of childhood cruelties (the older brother is cruel to the lead character, the lead character is cruel to his \\"friends\\").  Unlike Charlie Brown books, there is no sense of empathy, there are no consequences to the bullying, lying to parents, or cheating in school.  It is an endless series of \\"getting over\\" on the adults, torturing peers, and a \\"how to\\" on cheating. There are no consequences and there is no remorse. The episode where the lead character, and ultimately most of the school, pretends that a boy who has just returned to the school doesn't exist was a stunning example of rejection and the kind of bullying that could devestate a child.  I simply can't imagine what other people who reviewed this book thought was funny. I'm not saying that all reading material has to teach something or have greater meaning (\\"Archie\\" comics, for example, are simply fun to read.)  But this normalization and validation of tormenting peers and cheating is really not something that children should be reading. Oh, and let's not forget the language.  I had to explain to my 9 year old daughter what the following line meant: \\"the girls came up to Rowley at lunch and started kissing his butt\\" (pg. 35).  Honestly, I could understand why an 11 year old boy would want to read this.  But I'm not sure why anyone would think it's ok.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I actually wasn't looking forward to this album.  I'm a MAJOR Bob Dylan fan and I appreciate the fact that this is all donated to charity. I purchased this album and to my surprise, I actually think that it's a stronger album than TOGETHER THROUGH LIFE. The band sounds tighter and it really grooves. You can tell Bob is having fun recording this. His voice sounds like it has sustained years of touring, Whiskey, Cigars, and Booze, but it sounds as powerful as ever. It contains a strong energy and encompasess many different and eclectic sounds.<br />The first track: \\"Here Comes Santa Claus.\\" This has a sound that if you just imagine, it brings back a time of Christmas Trees covered in Tinsel and Salvation Army bands performing in front of Goldblatts. Presents under the tree consisted of Lionel Trains, Wooden Sleds, Tinkertoys, and  Baseball Mitts. It has such a nostalgic sound that pure holiday magic comes out of your speakers. \\"Winter Wonderland\\" is a fun a swinging rendition that borders on satire, but has just the right touches of fun and parody.<br />\\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" sounds like a song to walk home in the snowfall, after closing a bar, looking at Christmas lights. It, ( like TOGETHER THROUGH LIFE) borders and parallels a distinctive Tom Waits sound.<br />Understand that this is not a Christmas album for everyone.  You probably wont hear this at a company \\"Holiday Party.\\" But it IS a good listen and a very pleasant surprise. Buy this CD, support the cause and Happy Holidays!
0783233477|1.0|This is the first review I have written, although I watch a number of movies. This movie looks like it was contrived by a bunch of Hollywood types who have the depth  of a puddle on the sidewalk, trying to create a \\"deep\\" introspective movie. It fails miserably.     Anthony Hopkins plays an East Coast business giant, and frankly, plays it very well. But Brad Pitt? He is supposed to be passed off as an \\"advisor\\" to Hopkins, but with the frosted hair and wooden performance, he winds up looking and acting like a stoned surfer dude who someone dressed up in a suit. I've seen several of Pitt's comedic performances, and they were very, very funny (I thought he was a genius in Burn After Reading, because he DID play a stoned surfer dude type character-actually a personal trainer, but what's the difference? But I digress.). But in this movie Pitt is just plain awful.    Aside from Pitt, the whole Plot seemed contrived, and none of the characters are especially likeable. And 3 hours? Geez-90 minutes would have done it for me.    Finally, another reviewer raised a criticism which was not readily apparent to me, but after thinking about it, he/she is right on point. The movie does seem to revel in the fact that Hopkins character is very wealthy, and that \\"rich\\" people are much more special than the rest of the population. There are buckets of dialog about how this senator, and that governor, are attending the birthday party. Then Hopkins' birthday speech is a completely self absorbed homily to himself-if not overtly, then at least implicitly. Even before Hopkins discovers the reason for Joe Black's appearance, he acts disinterested (to the point of being annoyed) about his daughter's excessive plans for the party. No traces of humility here-even in the face of death.    If you are a 13 year old girl, you might like this movie. otherwise, don't waste 3 hours of your life, like I did. You have been warned.

B002E2M5J6|2.0|Jamiroquai can get a little long in the tooth when it comes to experimental jams on stage and this performance is no exception. Combine that with a bad mix of the songs - way too much reverb, improperly-compressed instruments, and muddy mid-range - you are left feeling unsatisfied at the end of almost every song. Jamiroquai CAN and DO sound good and play great - this rating is not their fault mostly. As far as visually, the direction is decent but the camera switching is sloppy. The HD signal is full of sharpening from post and looks quite low-end.<br /><br />I love Jamiroquai in general - I feel bad for them that the production and post-production teams were so sub-par on this one.

143911000X|5.0|A couple co-workers introduced me to this book and read me a couple of the \\"Articles\\".  I then found out it was written, based on a Character in the sit-com \\"How I Met Your Mother\\".  I had never seen the show, but the co-workers watched it, as does my Son.  Very funny.  The book is just a funny, warped look at a pseudo lifestyle that borders on reality (for Bro's that is!).  I've since bought 6 copies for Christmas presents for fellow \\"Bro's\\".

B000ICL3KG|1.0|Well folks you don't have to watch this movie to review it.  You either believe in global warming or you don't.  I myself believe in god and believe that there is no way possible that human beings are going to destroy this planet by using fossil fuels etc.  Thousands of scientists have dismissed global warming as a good myth, but nothing more.  The earth has actually been cooling since 1998, but the libs and \\"environmentalist\\" would have you believe that we will all be dead very shortly.  Actually according to the great Gore we should've all died yrs ago isn't that right liberals????  Gotcha!!!!  Global warming is the biggest hoax ever created and it was created to tax everyone and everything and it will help lead to a one world government and then well christians you know the rest.  If liberals really want to help they should just go ahead and cease breathing since their co2 is killing the planet.  I mean just the fact that humans are breathing out co2 is killing the planet so really we should all go find another Jim Jones to follow and drink the cool-aid so we can help save the planet.   Now thats funny right there I don't care who you are.  Keep up the lies libs we conservatives just keep laughing!!!

B002KQ6BT6|1.0|It took me many days of determined reading to get through this really dreadful book. I'm not sure why I spent money on this, it's not a mistake I will make on Dan Brown again. There was one aspect of the book that surprised me, but the rest I could have predicted completely. The thing that bugs me the most is that the publisher flooded the market with the book (a huge first run print) so that other books won't make #1 on the NYT Bestseller list. I would have given it zero stars but Amazon doesn't have that option.
B002C6K7NU|5.0|This is one of, if not THE BEST CD releases of the year. Not one bad song on this CD. I can only hope that Skynyrd stays together and keeps making music, especially like this.    Greatb job, guys!
B000007XUQ|5.0|I don't know if this is the best Christmas collection ever, but it's surely on the short list along with the Boston Pops, Percy Faith, Johnny Mathis and Bing Crosby. The vocals are excellent (particularly \\"Little Altar Boy\\", the \\"First Snow/Let It Snow!\\" pairing and \\"Merry Christmas Darling.\\" The arrangements? Impeccable. The only weak selection: \\"Ave Maria.\\" It just doesn't work -- but that's four minutes out of almost two hours, and I'll take that any day.
B0000DJZA0|4.0|For me the most enjoyable parts of this CD/DVD comp were on the DVD (had gotten a preview of the songs on LaunchCast so i knew what to expect sonically from the band).  The extras showed some cool things like Chris Martin singing in the shower with his clothes on :D, the band kicking it in a little harder on \\"Trouble\\" (very unexpected, wished they did it more often), the psycho fan in LA who tried to jump the fence :? and the multiple angles of all the band members.  From the CD side of things, there wasn't that much difference between the studio & live versions aside from crowd participation, so the newer songs, \\"Moses\\", \\"One I Love\\", & \\"See You Soon\\" are most welcome.  All in all, a good addition to the catalog.
0061914177|5.0|It's not hard to explain Gary Vaynerchuk, he's energetic, he's passionate and he believes that you should be spending your life doing something you LOVE.  This all comes through in \\"Crush It!\\" many times over.  This book is a must read for anyone who does business or is passionate about anything.  Gary will take you through the steps of creating and growing your on-line brand.<br /><br />It's a fairly quick read, but full of useful information.  It was nice to get a little bit more background of Gary and his family as well as the story of how he started in with all the social media the Internet has to offer.  I don't think many people would disagree that Gary is one of the top authorities on using the Internet as a way to grow a brand with very little cash.  In the Internet age it's all about being passionate, working harder than the next guy and caring about what you do, and \\"Crush It!\\" explains just how you translate that into today's landscape.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to an audio version of this book so I can refresh and remind myself of all the principals and ideas in this book and to keep me motivated.  Thanks Gary!
B00006LIRI|3.0|This compilation differs from the previous one in that there are more remixes of existing songs (though the one for Elevation is surprisingly missing, while the ones that were selected add nothing new to the tracks) and more selections from soundtracks.  Like their \\"Best of ... 1980-90\\", there are songs that could've made the cut without compromising the quality of the album (i.e. The Fly, Ultraviolet, If God Will Send His Angels, Walk On) and songs that should've just been left on the scrap heap (Even Better Than The Real Thing, Mysterious Ways, Discotheque, Hold Me Thrill Me...).  \\"The First Time\\" is a great choice to close the album though & I had yet to hear \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" or \\"The Hands That Built America\\", both of which it turns out are excellent songs in their own right.  If I could I'd give it more 3.5 stars than 3, cause it's U2 after all.
0061914177|5.0|Q: How do you turn $20 into $2 Million?<br />A: Buy Crush It, Add Talent + Passion + Hustle (a LOT of hustle)<br /><br />If you have followed Gary Vaynerchuk at all for the past two years, the content of \\"Crush It\\" will not provide many surprises.  What it will do, however, is sum up two years of keynote addresses, Internet videos, chat sessions, interviews, and guest posts into a two hour lesson on life, passion, and success.  Gary lays out the formula that has made him a successful entrepreneur, and as he labels his popularity, a triple-Z-list celebrity.<br /><br />Instead of creating a book that says, \\"Do what I did and you will be successful too\\", Gary wrote a book that says, \\"Be who you are, work harder than ever at being you and doing what you love, and you will be successful too.\\"<br /><br />Reading this book flows like one of Gary's famous keynote addresses. The reason being that instead of sitting down and writing this book, Gary dictated it to someone who was best at taking his words and putting them on paper.  This falls directly into line with the message of being true to who you are.  Gary's DNA is to be energetic and passionate, and the person who took his words and put them on paper, well, their DNA is to be good at doing that.<br /><br />Buy this book and it will inspire you to do great things, but be warned, this is by no means a get-rich-quick or easy approach to changing your life.  This is passion, patience, and TONS of hustle.
B000059T1V|5.0|This 1960 recording came at an interesting crossroads in musical history. In the US, we were experiencing a big boom in folk music, which had obvious blues connections. A similar movement was taking place in England with the popularity of skiffle. Many of the older blues musicians of the thirties and forties, who had not performed much for several decades, or who had performed in obscurity, were 'rediscovered' and appeared at this concert. The young men in England who would later become famous as the Rolling Stones, the Animals, the Kinks, the Yardbirds and the Beatles, were just coming of age. They would recognize the greatness of this music, immerse themselves in it, and, ironically, bring it back to the States in a recharged version, which made it more easily accessible to the vast US record-buying public. As they say, \\"the blues had a baby, and they named it Rock & Roll.\\"<br /><br />Muddy Waters, aka McKinley Morganfield, is, to many people, myself included, the greatest blues singer who ever lived. This is a good representation of what he could do at the time, what he had already been doing for ten years in Chicago, and what he continued to do for the next twenty years. Nothing fancy, just piano, drums, bass, harp, and a couple guitars, all wired up so you could hear them in the bars, over the sound of the talking, the broken glasses, the bodies in motion. And let's put to rest the notion that Muddy was one of the greatest guitarists of all time. Honestly, he only knew a few riffs, only played a couple chords. But what he knew, and what he communicated.....it's beyond words.<br /><br />While we're at it let's not forget the contributions of that immortal songwriter, Willie Dixon, who penned most of the material Muddy made famous. Muddy's band changed in personnel over the years, but of course, his voice--that inimitable, deep, manly, resonant, powerful blues shouting voice--just kept getting better and better. The thing that makes this one special is that it is one of the first \\"live\\" electric blues shows ever recorded. You can also get the Muddy DVD which shows footage from it, which is also a must-own.st \\"live\\" electric blues shows ever recorded.

076532413X|5.0|First, don't think this is the same story you will see on the new TV show based (very loosely) on this book.  The characters, circumstances and even the duration of the flash forward event are completely different.  While I have enjoyed the first few TV shows, I absolutely loved this book.      Set at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN the protagonists are physicists searching for the Higgs Boson.  Robert Sawyer does an excellent job at creating a believable setting and using some very good speculative theoretical physics as the basis for the story.  The author clearly knows his physics.  The action is fast and fascinating - this is a page turner, very hard to put down.  This is a book that stretches your mind while you are reading it, and which I will remember with the best of the Sci-Fi I've read.  This was the first book I have read by Sawyer, but if the other ones are similar, I will rank him up with my favorites - Clarke, Asimov, Heinlein and Pohl.

B002C1BHIO|5.0|I am not the most technically savvy person, so I can only tell you what I see and understand about this product.  First of all, it was incredibly easy to open.  There were no fights with the plastic boxes that seem to have no openings and I was not forced to resort to arming myself with scissors or a box cutter, greatly reducing the chances of injury.  Who wants their tombstone to read \\"She died valiantly fighting product packaging\\"?  Second, the cable looks great.  It seems far sturdier than other cables I have used in the past and the bits on each end look well made.  Third, and perhaps most important, this product is backed by Amazon, meaning good customer service and support, as well as easy return (if needed).  The product has a 1-year warranty and since I have not had any problems with Amazon service in the past, I am sure that using that warranty, if necessary, would be easy.  I am glad that Amazon has started the Amazon Basics line.  It removes the need for all those little trips to the electronics store and replaced it with easy shopping and easy shipping at competitive prices.

0066620996|4.0|Good to Great presents some novel theories on business management that go against many commonly held beliefs.  For example, it supports the theory that humble, subdued executives are required for sustained growth while superstar executives hurt rather than help a company's chance for greatness.  However, the study in the book fails to prove that the factors for success apply to all organizations, as it claims.  In fact, the study falls short in three areas: 1) its empirical evidence shows high correlation between the factors and greatness, but it is incapable of showing causation.  2) The study claims that all seven listed success factors are necessary for a transition to greatness, but it does not show that the seven factors are sufficient.  The Experiment, where researchers would iteratively guess at a theory and then test it leaves a lot of room for missing an important and required success factor.  3) The study never proves applicability to organizations outside the list of 28 studied companies during the studied time period (from about 1970 to 2000).

B0025KVLTW|3.0|Let's not get too excited here, folks. There is not a lot of difference in these \\"remastered\\" albums than the ones previously available.    These reviews should be primarily about what the sound difference is in these newly released albums, not the album itself. I bought Magical Mystery Tour and The Beatles Past Masters and I am disappointed in both. Can you hear things in Magical Mystery Tour that you couldn't hear before? A bit, but nothing remarkable. They are also bass deficient on some cuts which I thought would be eliminated. And I'm not listening to these on a Mickey Mouse stereo either- a Bryston amp & preamp, Snell speakers & a Meridian cd player.   Who are these people absolutely gushing over these remastered albums?????? There is very little difference in these newly reissued albums. Always take a review, any review, with a grain of salt.

B001LA3JWY|5.0|Although it's been a couple of years since I read it, Hiroshima is still ingrained in my memory.  Hersey introduces a situation of which most people are aware.  You are thrust into the lives of a handful of individuals before, during, and after the catastrophic events that marked at that time the pinnacle of human ingenuity and human horror.  Like Joseph Conrad in his masterpiece Heart of Darkness, Hersey paints a beautiful yet terrifying picture, sparing no detail.  By the end of all the descriptions of death and decay, you feel you have also experienced it, because no matter how many statistics are taught in the classroom or how many pictures you're shown, without that human connection, the dead are just nameless bodies.  This is why Hiroshima is as important as it is informational.  Hersey connects you with survivors, and tells their remarkable stories to a world that needed to hear them and in reality still needs to hear them.

0061730327|5.0|These days, the word \\"hero\\" is casually thrown around in many conversations, with famous people simply doing the things they are supposed to do getting labeled 'heroes.'  Sure the rock star who stops taking drugs is to be congratulated, and the high school football team should be cheered on to victory, but neither meet the true definition of a hero.  However, William Kamkwamba is a hero in every sense of the word.<br /><br />We meet William in Malawi, a smart boy who had to drop out of school because his parents (father, really) didn't have the money to keep him there.  Undaunted, William starts spending time at his local library.  There he finds a basic Physics textbook.  He decides that he would like to make the windmill shown in the textbook, but is hampered by obstacles that would send a lesser boy running.  William cannot read English, the language of the textbook, for one.  No problem - he simply uses the graphs to teach him.  (they must have been a lot better graphs than my old physics textbook!)  Then there is the problem of materials.  William is a born tinkerer and engineer and he manages to cobble together local (free) materials to build his windmill. PVC pipe, a bicycle inner tube and bit of wire all fit into William's vision of a working windmill, and despite the opinion that it couldn't work, it worked very well indeed.  William's windmill powered a water pump, saving village women countless hours toting water; charged cell phones (!) and lit a precious few lightbulbs in his village.  His windmill, despite the detractors who scoff at anything they didn't think of themselves, did everything that William wanted it to do.<br /><br />Eventually, the wider world found out.  Visiting scientists wrote about the windmill in a blog, and soon there were people making the trek to his village (accessible only by bus) to see the windmill for themselves.  With the speed of the Internet, William is suddenly speaking about African issues, visiting the United States and making the talk show circuit.<br /><br />What I found amazing about this book was William's attitude. He saw an opportunity to solve a problem and just fixed the problem.  No foreign advisors, ambassadors, scientists or any Western minds or Western money was necessary to electrify a village.  William accomplished his goal in a short time.  The US has diplomats, scientists and foreign aid workers in Africa for half a century, and has invested billions of dollars to help African people become self-sufficient. William helped his village to become self-sufficient without a dollar of aid, or a minute of helf from the so-called experts. Pretty cool, huh?<br /><br />The book is divided into several portions: One is mainly a history of Malawi and it's neighbors to get the reader acclimated with the area and the challenges William faced.  The second section is \\"the Story of William,\\" more or less and the last is \\"William meets the Outside World.\\"  I found the last part to be the least interesting, but I think it was necessary to understand the rest of the book.<br /><br />Self-sufficient, well-spoken and decent are the things I thought of when I saw William on television.

B002436WFI|4.0|I disagree with the reviewer that says pass if you're not a reader of Terry Pratchett's books. Anyone that enjoys fantasy, especially with some tongue in cheek humor will probably enjoy it. It reminds me a little of the better fantasy movies with a helping of some Monty Python type humor. I was drawn to rent this because I thoroughly enjoyed \\"[[ASIN:B0010X741Y Hogfather]]\\". This story revolves around what seems a normal traveller, well played by Sean Astin, that has somehow ended up in Discworld. He accompanies a bumbling wizard, played by David Jason, that is charged with the safe visit of the tourist and then trying to prevent the destruction of their world. Their adventures to see and then save Discworld are exciting and funny. Little comments about a chest with a \\"wooden expression\\", and \\"I have a Wizard and I'm not afraid to use him\\", sometimes might not be all caught the first time you watch it and add to the pleasure with repeat viewings. The wonderful cast includes Tim Curry as an evil wizard, Christopher Lee as Death, and Jeremy Irons as the Patrician. The costumes, sets, music, and special effects are quite good. Hats off to the screenwriter and director for making this work so well. I loved it and so I ordered the DVD from Amazon and got a great price for a new one from one of the sellers. Great quality DVD with lots of replayability. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch [[ASIN:B000WZAE1I Stardust (Widescreen Edition)]].<br /><br />CA Luster
B0021L8UPS|4.0|I'm sick and tired of the so-called expert critics trashing this sure to be classic down the road.  Yes, it has some cliche scenes, but to compare it to Omen, and the Good Son-as I did originally) is an unfair observation, oh no, this girl has Mac Culkin beat. A friend and I saw this on its premeire night and really enjoyed it. We saw some cliches, but the twist was completely unexpected! Even watching the trailer won't tell you everything this time. You won't see it coming, even if you're looking for it.  Anyone who finds this film funny totally missed the point, yes there are a few funny scenes, this film takes itself just seriously enough that you won't mind the cliches, and when the twist is revealed, you'll be like, what the....  fill in the blanks. Unlike the Good son-this film can't be suggested for anyone under the age of 21, I don't care if it is rated R, even with young kids, this film is properly rated and is Not for kids. Any parent who lets their kids watch this under 21, would be making a mistake, a few scenes creeped both of us out-and he's a nurse! Go figure! Anyway, don't listen to the critics, see this film if you like the kind, but rent it first.    March 9, 2010)  I've just read some reviews from other websites trying to boycott this film-which failed poorly. I've heard it so many times, its almost become a mantra-it's only a movie, lighten up! The one parental organization trying to boycott it is so contradictive, not to mention hypocritical(check out Wikipedia, you'll see what I mean.) No one complained about so many other excessively violent movies in the past few years, so, until you watch the movie for yourself, you really shouldn't judge it so harshly. On this website however, despite the contraversy, I'm impressed with the overall praise it's received, so obviously most viewers saw it in its proper context. I'm not a parent myself by choice, but I know this a work of well-crafted fiction and wouldn't stop me from adopting, if I wanted to.
B0000AUHPG|1.0|this is a classic movie????? if you're of that opinion i suggest you try reading some books. i've always been a book person, but am trying to give movies a try.  i guess i had better go back to books. it seems like for about 2 hours of this almost 3 hour film, everyone just slowly walks around and stares at each other. i guess this is suppose to show that they are really really bad. honestly this is a childish revenge fantasy movie that's all cliche. from early on in the film, you know exactly how it's going to end, who will die, that sort of thing. like my review title says this is art created for the mentality of a 7 year old boy. my goodness this is bad bad art. laughable. good soundtrack though.

0375826726|2.0|No need to restate what others have covered so thoroughly about the shortcomings of this book. In my humble opinion, the main problem, along with lack of editing and focus, is that Paolini is no longer a 15 year-old, homeschooled, prodigy. He is an 'established' author and therefore should be held to the same standards, which he is obviously not. This series had so much potential but fell short everytime for me. I regret that I've been drawn into it because, as much as I hated the third book, I will be compelled to buy the next one just to finish what I started. He was never a great writer, but at 15 I gave him a lot of credit for writing an entire novel and bestseller. However,  the free pass is gone and it's time to for him to become the genius writer we expected. Hopefully with so many negative reviews his publishers will wake up.     Great story, bad delivery.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|It's rare at the moment to see a science fiction movie that isn't a remake, a cash-in, an adaptation, or a spinoff of another big success.<br /><br />But \\"District 9\\" is not that kind of movie. Instead, the rarest kind of film -- a unique and original idea, handled in an intelligent manner, with no big name actors or flashy special effects. Director Neill Blomkamp instead creates a truly captivating sci-fi movie -- and by inverting the whole alien-invasion trope, Blomkamp also forces his audience to think. Hard.<br /><br />Almost thirty years ago, an alien ship appeared over South Africa -- but it brought neither global destruction or salvation. When soldiers cut their way in, they found starving refugees who are now nicknamed \\"prawns.\\"<br /><br />Currently the aliens live as outcasts in District 9 while nations argue over them, and the company Multi-National United is selected to make their weapons work... which is not possible, because only alien DNA can activate them. Then during forced evictions of District 9, a typically callous MNU field operative named Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) accidently sprays himself with a black alien fluid in a little lab. Unfortunately, it starts turning him into one of the aliens.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, the MNU wants the secrets of Wikus' changing body, and the corporation is not terribly picky about how they get it. He manages to escape into the only place where he has a chance of surviving -- the very alien slum that he was trying to empty, District 9. And his only chance of surviving and becoming human again lies with an alien scientist who is trying to reactive the hovering \\"prawn\\" mothership.<br /><br />Segregation. Blatant discrimination (including a racist nickname). Poverty. Shanty towns. Large companies and countries who care nothing for the despised minority population. It's painfully clear what would probably happen if spooky insectile aliens were to land on humanity's doorstep -- and Neill Blomkamp pulls no punches in his allegorical examination of apartheid, alien-style -- with the poor \\"prawns\\" as the universal victims. It's a hard, gruesome story with painfully graphic violence (Wikus gleefully bombs alien eggs) but it really needs to be that way.<br /><br />Blomkamp also presents his story in a unique way -- much of it is filmed like a documentary, though thankfully it has none of the sickmaking shakiness of movies like \\"Cloverfield\\" or \\"The Blair Witch Project.\\" There are plenty of spliced interviews, documentaries and news footage, which are cloaked in a feeling of gritty, dusty realism -- the dark industrial mothership with its slimy interior, the dusty slum, and the poor aliens who basically scavenge through garbage to survive.<br /><br />But the last quarter of the movie also evolves it into a slam-bang explosion-riddled action flick, without losing its focus -- there are some brilliantly gruesome scenes where the aliens turn against some human attackers, and Wikus even gets to kick butt anime-style in an alien battle-suit. If there's a flaw with this movie, it's the whole idea that humans wouldn't be at all afraid of aliens who are clearly technologically superior to us -- they have a freaking SPACESHIP that's been sitting over Johannesburg for thirty years!<br /><br />It also has the virtue of the most alien aliens seen in ages -- they move, look, speak (click click!) and think nothing like humans, and they're slimy and kinda creepy looking. They have no grandiose plans or pretty sparkly technology. Yet Blomkamp infuses them with a sense of nobility and strength, and despite their insectile faces he makes you feel what they do after awhile.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that this is Sharlto Copley's first acting role, because his performance is so strong: Wikus is a pretty despicable human being, who has fun killing aliens and ejecting them from their homes. It takes a physical transformation into an \\"other\\" to change his spirit as well. And Blomkamp lets us see the pain of his transition even when we don't like him (including a heartrending phone call to his wife). The supporting actors also provide excellent lesser performances, but Copley rules this one.<br /><br />As for the single-disc DVD... well, it's pretty skimpy, honestly. It will have a director's commentary by Blomkamp, which is pretty much guaranteed to be awesome -- I would love to see how he conjured the aliens and their hovering ship. There's also the \\"Koobus Big Gun\\" featurette, a three part \\"Filmmaker's Log,\\" and a sequel log called \\"Refining District 9.\\" The downside: The original short film \\"Alive in Joburg\\" that this movie stems from is NOT included. I don't know why -- it's certainly short enough to fit.<br /><br />\\"District 9\\" is a brilliantly original, hard-hitting movie that wraps a timeless human failing in an alien skin.

B0002KVUKM|5.0|Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman - [[ASIN:B000HEVZ9E X-Men Trilogy (X-Men/ X2 - X-Men United/ X-Men - The Last Stand)]]) turned up on the steps of the Vatican half dead and unable to remember his past, aside from the odd dream and nightmare.  Since then he has become a hunter of abnormal and supernatural beings.  He does this on behalf of the \\"Knights of the Holy Order\\", a secret organisation run by the Vatican.<br /><br />After \\"dealing\\" with Mr Hyde he returns to Rome and is told that his next mission will be to go to Transylvania to assist the Valerious family in conquering Count Vladislaus Dracula (Richard Roxburgh - [[ASIN:B00005JM5B The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (Widescreen Edition)]]).  If they fail to destroy Dracula they will be cursed to never enter the gates of heaven.<br /><br />Van Helsing takes with him a Friar called Carl (David Wenham - Faramir in [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)]]) who is the Order's version of Q, coming up with all of Van Helsing's gadgets, and the films comic relief.<br /><br />Arriving in Transylvania they meet and team up with Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale - [[ASIN:B0000VAFO0 Underworld (Widescreen Special Edition)]]) and go in search of the way to beat Dracula.<br /><br />The start of the film recreates the old black and white Frankenstein movies.  Simon West's \\"It's alive\\" line was sublime for me (I am a fan of the old black and white horror films that I watched as a child).  The Frankenstein monster is played by Shuler Hensley and Igor (Kevin J O'Connor - [[ASIN:B00000JQB5 The Mummy (Widescreen Collector's Edition)]]).<br /><br />This is the usual fun film from Stephen Sommers, in the same vein as the Mummy, etc.  It does not take itself too seriously.  And there is Kate Beckinsale is there in tight pants for those who like her, and Hugh Jackman and David Wenham for the rest of us.<br /><br />All in all it's a great family film - fun with scary bits.
0446402397|4.0|Leo is a respected member of the State Security organization in Stalinist Russia.  However, he begins to lose faith in the Soviet doctrine when he realizes that he has arrested an innocent veterinarian and caused several unwarranted executions in the process.  When his doubt surfaces, he is asked to investigate his beautiful wife Raisa as a possible traitor.  This loyalty test ultimately results in the banishment of Leo and Raisa to a manufacturing town and substandard living conditions.  There Leo comes to realize that a series of senseless child murders across the country are linked but have been blamed on a variety of unfortunate suspects, because the idea of a serial killer in the proletariat paradise is unacceptable to the powers-that-be.  What's really fascinating about this book is not only the fact that horrific crimes are virtually swept under the rug but that those people who don't play along are enemies of the State.  I have to assume that this depiction is fairly accurate, and the question of how a government gets away with this is thought-provoking.  Constituent compliance is a requirement and a reality.  It's bizarre that perceived party loyalty dictates one's living conditions and workplace status in a supposedly Marxist society.  The book presents farmers and other rural residents as being more likely to buck the system, since the restrictive government seems to be more of an obscure concept that has no positive bearing on their lives.  These portrayals commanded my attention much more than the \\"thriller\\" aspects of the novel, which were fairly typical in that everything is wrapped up neatly at the end.

I've hated Star Trek since I was a child - it was one of my father's obsessions and I was put off by his need to watch it over and over again, ad infinitum (especially when he decided to tell me what was about to happen several seconds before it did happen).  I thank goodness for the invention of the media player and the personal dvd player, which means that I don't have to inflict my obsessions on my family.<br /><br />This film had action, romance (thankfully very limited), comedy, tension and more.<br /><br />I was relieved to see that they had chosen new actors to play the roles.  James T Kirk (Chris Pine - [[ASIN:B00063KGPU The Princess Diaries 2 - Royal Engagement (Full Screen Edition)]]) is, er, shall we say self-assured and brash.  After trying to pick up Uhura (Zoe Saldana) in a bar he is talked into joining star fleet academy (again) by Captain Christopher Pike (Bruse Greenwood).  On the transporter he meets a recently divorced, jaded and overly anxious Dr Leonard McCoy aka Bones (Karl Urban - [[ASIN:B000A2X4D8 The Truth About Demons]], [[ASIN:B00151QYCQ Out of the Blue]]).<br /><br />Three years later Bones is a changed man, much more relaxed, but, unfortunately, his friend Kirk isn't.

B002KLAL4W|5.0|After much of my disappointment with Muse and their latest crap album Resistance, finally something good and refreshing.    In my opinion, you cannot go wrong with Pearl Jam. In the worst possible case, you'll get a nice collection of jamming songs. In most other cases however, songs will be memorable for years to come with great lyrics! This new album is really good, if not a bit short. I respect them very much.    Pearl jam is one of a few (older) bands that haven't sold out. Ten stars out of five for that!
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Cry Me a River has great band music.  Haven't Met You Yet is my favorite.  Michael Buble's voice is wonderful.  I love his remake of Georgia on My Mind.  I think that Heartache Tonight is better than the Eagles!  This is a CD that I am proud to own.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|This CD is a very good overview of George's solo career with a few live cuts of some of his best Beatles songs taken from The Concert for Bangladesh.  It's a great place to start if you're just discovering Harrison.  The remastered sound is excellent.  It comes in a very sturdy, shiny, dual-fold cardboard digipak (actually one of the nicer ones I've seen - not cheap at all)  I'm a fan of the jewel case but this one is pretty well made.  Nice liner notes and pictures of George.  4 and 1/2 stars... Check it out!
1440468397|4.0|Jane Austen is famous for her English dramas of marriage, love and societal acceptance.  Her latest novel Persuasion continues the theme of society, love, and marriage and how money and jealousy interferes.  Published posthumously, Persuasion is a dramatic story about persuading others of love, adhering to wishes of family and society, and the subtle hints that foretell every climatic chapter.    Widower Sir Walter Elliot lives on his Kellynch-hall estate with his two daughters Elizabeth and Anne.  Both girls had unsuccessful chances at marriage: Elizabeth was turned down by Mr. Elliot, a family cousin and heir to Sir Walter's estate who married a plain woman of fortune instead; Anne had a great affair with a Mr. (now Captain) Wentworth, a naval officer who had nothing--and was therefore ineligible--to marry Anne.  As Sir Walter falls deeper into debt, the Elliot family leases the estate to an Admiral Croft in order to save money.  And Admiral Croft, naturally, is a great friend of Captain Wentworth, who reappears eight years after he and Anne parted.  Can Anne persuade Captain Wentworth to lover her once again?  The answer lies in the story.   Like in her other novels, Jane Austen incorporates the manners and social customs of the early 1800s in her novels.  The novel speaks of the \\"great war\\" with Napoleon that the British Navy fought, and the characters are forever thinking about money and royal connections.  Anne very much wanted to marry Captain Wentworth when the first fell in love.  But English custom demands that a couple gets approval of their marriage from the bride's family.  And as Captain Wentworth was poor at the time, the Elliots strictly forbade Anne from marrying him, and she didn't.  Throughout the novel the characters also maintain an air of sophistication and elegance--an air required of everyone in the British court.  And as Sir Walter Elliot was known in court, the whole family had to behave with \\"utmost decorum.\\"     \\"It was impossible for herto have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again.\\" (Austen 197).     Foreshadow is prominent in the novel.  In Chapter 2 both Captain Wentworth and Mr. Elliot are mentioned, assuring the reader that they will be prominent main characters.  It was not until the end that the characters discover the reason behind Mr. Elliot's first marriage, but one character hinds that \\"money, money was all that he wanted\\" (Austen 178).  After page 17 it becomes obvious to the reader what would happen between Anne and Captain Wentworth, for \\"repeating his name so often...was a new sort of trial on Anne's nerves\\" (Austen 44).  Little hints along the way suck the reader deeper and deeper into the story.   Although \\"Proper English\\" is intimidating when reading Jane Austen's stories, her plots are classics in love and marriage.  Anyone who has gone through a painful break up or a dramatic relationship knows just how much money, family and jealously can ruin a relationship.  Austen dramatically tells the stories of her heroines while maintaining a 19th century setting, and drops subtle hints along the way to keep readers hooked.  Persuasion is a classic that is understood and loved by all who read it.
0061914177|5.0|This book is the real deal. Gary has done a absolutely superb job of drawing out his knowledge and explaining it in his straight to the point way. Part autobiography part journey through business beliefs this book will not disappoint.<br /><br />Gary points out from the beginning that you must find what makes you happy and work form there but first you must love your family because that will make the base of your business. One of the best lines in the book is \\"It's never a bad time to start a business unless you are starting a mediocre one\\"(page 7).<br /><br />The first chapters explains how important it is for you to start thinking of yourself as a brand and then how to look at how your brand will build your future. The steps you take on social networks will not create your success but will help accelerate it. Brand building can take time so you have to be patient.<br /><br />One of the most important points is the knowledge that you gain today will help give you leverage for the future. This information could be used in stories or reviews.<br /><br />The future of business is and will be online and will become more interactive as time goes on. The standard business structure of today will transform into partnerships and joint ventures. Information will be dispensed in a social media platform.<br /><br />It is important to create good content and relevant product but also tell people what is really going on by being transparent.<br /><br />What I really liked about his book was that it proves that you too with time can use social media to help propel yourself into your own stardom without using old models that wouldd take forever. You can be the king of a niche or a media 2.0 rockstar but it takes time and effort. The great thing for you is that most people never start and if they do most people fall off and quit.<br /><br />Some people may not like how brash Gary is but you can not get along with everybody.<br /><br />Overall this book is amazing and will help you with a blueprint to help build your online presence. It is a fast read at 142 pages with no fluff. Pick it up and crush ita fast read at 142 pages with no fluff. Pick it up and crush it

0307269981|4.0|I am often frustrated by novels over 500 pages, coming away with the feeling that a hundred or more pages could have been edited out without much loss. That was not my experience when I read The Girl Who Played With Fire: I wanted the story to continue. Having been introduced to Lisbeth Salander in the first book of this trilogy, The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo, I was looking forward to her return along with Mikael Blomkvist in The Girl Who Played With Fire. We learn more about Lisbeth in this book, and see her use her prodigious skills to carry out justice. There are plenty of questions remaining, and some of those may be addressed in the next novel. In the meantime, reading The Girl Who Played With Fire satisfies a lot of curiosity, especially about Lisbeth's past. I read this quickly, enjoyed it thoroughly, and look forward to reading the third book in this trilogy, which was the last book Larsson completed before he died in 2004.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)

0385504225|3.0|Amazon currently has over a thousand reviews of The Lost Symbol, so there is really not much else to say. Just a few key points.<br /><br />1. If you enjoyed Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code, you will probably want to read this one. Lots of similarities in plot, pacing, and characters. Too much historical background at times.<br />2. Professor Langdon again shows amazing intellect and memory.<br />3. Bad guy very reminiscent of the albino monk in The Da Vinci Code<br />4. Symbols, clues, puzzles, and a race against time. Much religion and philosophy.<br />5. Freemasons won't be happy, but the D.C. Tourist Bureau will love the book. People will be going all over the city saying \\"Oh, look. That's in the book.\\"<br />6. A true page-turner. You'll want to see what happens next.

0375413405|5.0|As with many people, I naively found out about Julia Child and her cook book after watching the film Julie and Julia.  With a passion about France anyway I thought I'd give this book a go and have thoroughly loved it.  I've made her famous beef bourguignon which my husband completely raved about and her coq au vin which was amazingly delicious.  The recipes are easy to follow and all the ingredients are listed down the left hand side of the page which is also easy at a glance.  You do need to set aside some time to cook, this is not a throw it all together in 10 minutes, however if you want that special meal and advice also on accompanying wine then I'd definately recommend it.  It's also wonderful to see recipes of the past that can be repeated and thoroughly enjoyed.  It's definitely spurred on a passion to cook!

0385504225|1.0|I've read and enjoyed all of Dan Brown's previous books, especially the DaVinci Code. The only thing that could keep me even continuing to read this book was Brown's detailed descriptions of the Masonic symbols.  Other than that; the science, the plot, the character interaction, combined to make this one of the most quickly forgettable books that I've ever read.  I will anticipate Brown's next book with far more trepidation than I did this book.

B001PPLKI0|4.0|First, let me make it clear that this set is very good and the music is 5 stars.  However, after comparing the 3 Elvis spiritual/gospel box sets \\"Amazing Grace\\", \\"Peace in the Valley\\", and \\"I Believe\\", one cannot help but be a bit disappointed with this one because it's something of a missed opportunity.  As others have noted, there is a significant amount of previously released material that has unfortunately been left off.  The very idea of omitting the \\"Miracle of the Rosary\\" is mind boggling--a bit like leaving \\"Hey Jude\\" off of a Beatles singles collection (\\"Miracle...\\" is on both previous box sets as well as \\"Elvis Now\\").    There are any number of Elvis gospel single disc compilations, but the double disc set, \\"Amazing Grace,\\" was clearly aimed at those looking for a reasonably broad overview that goes a wee bit further than a single disc.  On the other hand, the \\"Peace in the Valley\\" box was designed for those (like me) who have really wanted a complete collection of the Elvis gospel material. (One critic from All Music Guide criticized it for being overly complete!)      With the current \\"I Believe\\" box, which has been marketed as updated and comprehensive, the compilers should have begun with everything on the \\"Peace in the Valley\\" box, and then added whatever additional rarities or alternate tracks they could come up with-- possibly including more broadly spiritual numbers (e.g.\\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\").  When I initially found out that the \\"I Believe\\" box would be a 4 disc set, I incorrectly assumed that the extra disc would consist of such music.  In fact, there is less here than on the 3 disc \\"Peace\\" box.  Many of the rarities not included here are, in my view, VERY essential.    \\"I Believe\\" is very good but if you already own the \\"Peace in the Valley\\" box set you may want to simply purchase and download the few songs that are not already on the earlier but more extensive box.
B001VPJYZK|4.0|[[ASIN:B001VPJYZK Desperate Housewives: The Complete Fifth Season]]  This is definitely one of the best shows on tv right now.  I love how they start the season out with a mystery and don't reveil the details until close to the end.  Plus there is always a cliffhanger.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Wow!  What a fantastic collection of music!  I am a long time Beatles fan, and was aware of the separate mono versions of the Beatles albums.  But I did not realize how significantly different some of the mono versions of really great Beatles songs are from the better known stereo versions.  I highly recommend this collection, not only for audiophiles who are very sensitive to differences of sound quality, but for anyone who is more than a casual Beatles fan.  The real revelations here are Sgt. Pepper and the White Album, both of which sound significantly different from their stereo counterparts.  There are different guitar parts on Sgt. Pepper, as well as different sound effects and mixes of instrumentation.  I would say that the title track, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" rocks considerably harder than the 'standard' stereo version, as does \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\\"  On the White Album, the violin part on \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" is completely different from that on the stereo version, as are the bird sounds on \\"Blackbird.\\"  \\"Helter Skelter\\" is quite different: different drum parts, and no fade-in after the fade-out (so, sadly, no Ringo yelling \\"I've got my blisters on my fingers!\\"--but a different enough version of the song to be worth collecting).  There are similar divergences on most of the albums, but these are just the ones that really leaped out at me on the first couple of listenings.  It really is like discovering the Beatles all over again--as if there has been another whole universe of Beatles music out there all along that I didn't know about.  You really do not have a complete Beatles collection if you only have the stereo versions of their music.  (That being said, I recommend the stereo remasters as well.  The sound is just incredible, even on an iPod.)
B001EXE2ZQ|5.0|A newspaper man in Rome will meet without realizing himself, a Princess who slips away from her Palace to travel of incognito in one of the most romantic cities of the world.<br /><br />The very nature of this romantic-comedy-fantasy engages to everybody. There are five fundamental reasons that support this timeless classic: The presence of the most lovable, tender and charismatic Audrey Hepburn who spells the viewer since her first appearance on screen; Rome itself, its streets, historical  monuments and sympathetic people; the fluid direction of William Wyler who must have found inspiration around the greatest exponents of the Italian neo realism; the presence of Gregory Peck whose touch of class and refinement makes he was the perfect counterpart for her and finally the marvelous script, which never falls in common places.<br /><br />As you and me are well aware, this brief space of twenty fours in the life of a Princess must be lived with frantic intensity, breaking the rules here and there. And spite we are conscious they will never become a permanent couple makes us conscious about the brevity of the life and how every little and insignificant moment must be lived - for better or worst.<br /><br />The final sequence in which the Princess receives the set of photographs accents still more the beginning of the nostalgia for those moments that will never come back.<br /><br />API chose labeled it among the four best romantic films ever. But far from this fact, Miss Hepburn won the coveted Academy award in 1953 when most of people thought the Prize would be for Deborah Kerr for he role in \\"From here to the eternity.\\"<br /><br />But finally What about Hollywood `s charm without Miss Hepburn? What about the proud of the cinema without \\"Sabrina\\" \\"Breakfast in Tiffany\\" and \\"Two for the road\\" (a film that personally love it)?<br /><br />Wherever she is, Audrey will always be the timeless bride of Hollywood.

B002KAJ0AO|1.0|I grew up listening to and worshiping the backstreet boys. I even loved their last two albums despite what critics said. It was a new sound for them, and they were relating to their grown up audience. I am not really sure what happened here. The writing is horrible, and all the songs sound the same. They obviously need to start working with writers and producers that have more experience, because this sounds like a 13 year old cut the album. Hopefully the next one will be better.
B002GZQYMA|5.0|MUSE seems to always have a way to break a barrier with each new album, and this one speaks nothing less than the truth here.  \\"The Resistance\\" blends alternative rock with electronica, and utilizes Bellamy's classical training, incorporating classic composers at the piano into something of the now.  I highly recommend this album.

As with any business book, I approached the launch of Crush It! with a sense of cautious optimism since I've been let down so many times by other business books.  But this title stands alone in a unique class.  So long as they are not my competition, I'm reaching out to as many business people, educators, and passionate creatives about this book.  Buy a copy for yourself and everyone you care about!
B0000073NC|5.0|Clearly this doesn't get enough attention in the Scorpions catalouge or in the hard rock lists. Probably just as well; the minute the rock aristocracy journos get their hands on something they run it into the ground and make it boring. They can keep their The Wall and Sgt Pepper, I'll listen to masterpieces like this one. Fly to the rainbow, easily one of the best songs ever... Far away, They need a million... two other brilliant tracks. This is the best, most consistent thing the Scorps ever did.

B002C1BHIO|5.0|This cable came packaged in a cardboard box, sealed on one side with a label that is easy to tear.  The cable itself rests inside with one wire tie holding it together.  The packaging is great!    The cable itself is about 4 times as thick as a normal low end cable, it has a cloth exterior.  The ends are gold and the connectors are thick and sturdy looking.  It's much better looking, and the build quality is better than any Monster cable I have purchased    I tested the cable between my PS3 and receiver, replacing a cheap cable I purchased on Amazon.  I didn't notice any difference in picture or audio quality, each cable worked great.  I would say I have more faith that this cable would hold up to use.  The big size makes it easy to spot in the tangle of cables in my audio cabinet.

B0013LL2Z2|4.0|This is my younger brother's favorite movie.....I thought it was quite good when I saw it in the theatre 30 yrs ago. The sets were, what was thought of as \\"futuristic\\" at the time where most public areas resembled an airport or superdome type location. This concept has been overdone but in Logan's Run it is understandably new. My favorite part is when the young girl touches the old man's wrinkles at the end. It still gives me the same hopeful feeling. A cute and somewhat meaningful film and a must see for sci-fi fans.

014241011X|4.0|I was first introduced to this book via the movie, which I adored as a kid (and still do). I enjoyed the book, though I did feel that the movie was better developed  - that may be personal bias, as I have never seen any of Dahl's books as vividly as directors do. Still, Halloween has always been my favorite holiday -and I always dressed as the stereotypical witch with a wart on her nose and green skin- and this book, as well as the movie, has a special spot in my heart.<br /><br />This book is slammed a lot by quite a few Wiccans who are upset over this book's portrayal of witches and witchcraft, claiming that it is derogatory to \\"real witches.\\" Dahl never, at any time, eludes to any neopagan religion. He clearly stays within the confines of centuries old stereotypes regarding Halloween witches - which, in my opinion, falls into the same realm as vampires and lycanthropes. These witches turn two boys into mice - clearly not a real life scenario. This book is, beyond a doubt, fiction. People need to stop being so uptight - and this is coming from an eclectic pagan!
B002JTMNX2|5.0|Do not listen to the jerks who rated this cd just 1 star.Obviously,they are Lou Gramm faithfulls who don't want FOREIGNER to continue without Lou.Mick Jones may be the only original member left but to me,he is FOREIGNER.The guy founded the band,came up with the band name,wrote or co-wrote almost every foreigner tune,and co-produced all foreigner albums.I was sad to hear about Lou's departure from the band but right now,I'm happy again because this new line-up really rocks.    IMO,this is a very strong effort by the band.There is something for everybody on this cd.TOO LATE,LONELY,AS LONG AS I LIVE,CANT SLOW DOWN,WHEN IT COMES TO LOVE,sound like tracks out of their earlier albums.IN PIECES,I'LL BE HOME TONITE,CAN'T GIVE UP,sounds more 80's.There are rockers,mid-tempos,and ballads and they are all good.Do yourself a favor.Get a copy.Even if you don't like the new tunes,you'll like the remixed greatest hits cd.The cd is only 12 dollars at wal-mart.
0486415856|3.0|I'm so upset with this book. The entire novel read much too slowly despite the fact that all these things were occuring. The author would take up an entire chapter just to say how Fanny did ONE thing, it was frustrating. Then to top it off the climax, falling point, and resolution literally all happened in the span of the last paragraph of the book as if it was a side note or something. Nonetheless, I did enjoy reading it.

I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift because I got him hooked on the franchise.Can't wait to see Amanda Tapping join the cast and see how the chemistry is between them.  The special features are mostly non-exsistent in the first 3 so I'm wondering if it's better in the last two.  I really like special features and get into seeing the behind the scenes, deleted scenes, outtakes and the cast talking about themselves and the show.  Watching season 3 now!  Can't wait for Christmas to watch the others.  The packaging is very nice with a picture of the entire cast.
B002MW50KO|2.0|Boy, this is one polarizing CD, wintry pun not intended. Those who love it simply rhapsodize about it, those who don't are getting nasty comments about their commitment to Dylan (and how do you critics feel about \\"Self-Portrait\\" or 1973's \\"Dylan\\"?) or to helping the poor and hungry. Frankly, I have to side with the disappointed. They are right: The arrangements are pleasant and the musicianship top-notch, but Bob is not in good voice here. In fact, he makes Tom Waits sound like Perry Como on this CD, and I love Tom Waits. I stll love Dylan and his lifetime of work, and, yes, I bought and listened to the album, and, no, I don't expect him to still be the Dylan of 1965, and yes, I do give to the poor and hungry, but I'd understand and forgive anyone who says they'd prefer to listen to something else this Christmas.
0061719544|5.0|From the moment he walked onto the set of The Late, Late Show murmuring,\\"I know, I know\\" to wild audience applause, I was hooked. Clearly several (several?  MANY!) cuts above the intelligence level of most TV performers, his free fall style is fascinating to watch. This incredible story, told in the same \\"one-on-one\\" style as his monologues, is just as fascinating.    From his sad beginning as a smart kid trying fit in with his peers (who put little value on brains) to his incredible phoenix-like rise from alcoholism, Mr. Ferguson connects with the reader on the same level as an intimate letter from a best friend.  Funny, touching, intelligent, crazy -- his book is a wild ride.    We should have more unlikely patriots like him!  Thank you for choosing America, Craig.
0385342020|5.0|I have always been a fan of Sophie Kinsella's books. I just finished reading this book and I must say I really enjoyed it. At first I was afraid I was going to be disappointed with the whole ghost idea... but it turned out to be a brilliant idea. The ghost Sadie is full of character and attitude and had me laughing non stop. The ghost actually made the book worthy. If you are a Shophie Kinsella's fan I would say don't pay much attention to the bad reviews... Get the book and stick to it till the end. It gets better and better as it goes. So much going on that you won't be able to put it down. I can't wait for her next! I wish she had books coming out more often! Just love her!!!

To make the inevitable - and perhaps unfair - comparison to Brown's other two books I've read, this one did not compel me to sit long into the night and keep turning the pages in anticipation of what comes next.<br /><br />Couldn't get over the sense that I was reading a novel written with the purpose of becoming a screenplay.<br /><br />The ending was weak and bizarre.  Ten hours of trauma that is followed up with a tour of Washington DC in the dead of a cold winter night?  Strange and misplaced.<br /><br />Nevertheless, as with Brown's other novels, this one served its purpose.  It entertained me and removed me temporarily from my reality.
B000EDWKXI|5.0|Having watched this movie several times, I never fail to laugh. The costumes are beautiful and though the movie revolves around a seducer  of women, a human side of true love and his determination to obtain that love, comes forth. Heath Ledger is fantastically entertaining as is Omid Djalili. Sienna Miller is that intelligent woman who knows what she wants and believes, and isn't afraid to speak of it. She is truly who all woman should strive to be. This is a movie to watch when one is in need of some romantic fun and a few laughs besides.
1419323571|2.0|I borrowed this recording from the library to try, after a bad experience with the itunes store and the recording with Lindsay Duncan.<br /><br />I only listened to the first couple tracks. I find the (american?) accent of the reader very distracting. I would prefer the reading to be a little slower; I felt quite rushed, something I don't like when listening to one of my favorite books.
B002MW50KO|3.0|OK, I've listened to it, will probably buy it as I have all of Dylan's material, but... I'm not sure if this will be a classic or go alongside William Shatner's music endeavors. I think I'd have rather heard Tom Waits do a Christmas album. Ya' listening out there Tom, pick some songs and have a go!

B002QQ8HAG|4.0|Just saw this yesterday, and enjoyed it very much.  There is something uplifting about the aspiration of beauty, even when it reaches unattainable heights of personal beauty (digitally enhanced) or sartorial splendor (that may or may not ever materialize in your local department store, let alone on the runway).  \\"The September Issue\\" soars with beautiful fashion photography as well as an almost undetectable level of tension and interpersonal cruelty, or percieved cruelty, coming from the dion of fashion, Anna Wintour.    Partnered with (and sometimes opposing) her long-time co-worker Grace Coddington, Wintour pushes to produce the annual \\"bible\\" of the fashion industry, the September issue of Vogue magazine.  That tome, alleged to be as thick as a phone book, drives her and the whole office to deeper and deeper levels of concentration and higher and higher levels of stress throughout, as we tag along and watch her making Svengali-like decisions that (very) frequently slap down her staff--almost in the style of Meryl Streep in \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\"  Devotees of that fictional comedy will be amused to see that the two women's offices are nearly identical, and may chuckle (or gasp) as Ms. Wintour abruptly dismisses a younger woman with an incongruous \\"thanks!\\" after clearly and firmly explaining that she's not getting what she wants from the somewhat devastated layout designer.  Ms. Streep, in \\"Prada,\\" famously ended her icy critiques with the airy, dismissive \\"that's all.\\"    In another scene, just after arriving in Paris with Ms. Coddington, Ms. Wintour seems to cringe and flinch ever-so-slightly, as if waiting for a confrontation after removing a lavish chunk of remarkable photography from the September planning (a series of photos supplied by Ms. Coddington herself).  But Ms. Coddington is too good a soldier to provoke a confrontation before the camera, which further attests to the power and respect her boss commands.    The movie becomes something of a \\"how-to\\"story of one woman's fierce leadership of a world-renown publication, though Ms. Wintour's decision-making is often opaque, maintaining an aura of mystery that further makes this a documentary worth talking about.
0754053385|1.0|I purchased this recording (read by Lindsay Duncan) through the iTunes store (something I will not be doing again), on the understanding that it was an unabridged recording. This is one of my favorite books, and I know it well enough to realize when sentences are being left out, which happened in several places (I did double-check with my print edition). At least one of the omitted sentences was important for understanding the characters.<br /><br />The other quibble I have is that the recording I purchased consisted of two SIX HOUR tracks. Heaven help you if you lose your place while using an mp3 player.<br /><br />I cannot dis-recommend this recording enough.
0786868724|5.0|Mitch Albom has been one of my favorite sportswriters for years; his style is eloquent, yet concise and very witty.  His words are well-chosen when he writes and this particular effort is no exception.  It's terrific.<br /><br />This is a remarkable, true story of contrast, of two men of God; one an aging rabbi, and the other, an African American pastor working in a ghetto.  Two men---two different faiths; two entirely different backgrounds.  In the end, the message is clear:  Faith ties us closely together and can give us the chance to accomplish things we never dreamed possible.<br /><br />Albom's anecdotal tale of his own personal experience with faith---losing it and regaining it---carries an inspirational message for anyone, regardless of religious affiliation, or lack thereof.  We come away with a better understanding of how life can be so meaningful, if we'll only give it a chance.<br /><br />Read this book; you'll be moved, as I was.
B00015YVDG|2.0|\\"Ransom\\" is one of those films that defined the late 90s. With large budgets, larger than life sets, bigger stars, and predictable situations, \\"Ransom\\" demonstrates that overabundant Hollywood escapism. There was no worry that a Mel Gibson movie would flop - there was no concern that ticket prices would drive audiences away - there was no worries about putting $80 million dollars on the table because this had everything late-90s cinema goers wanted to see with their popcorn and soda. This movie was melodramatic; this gave audiences an evil guy that was loved in \\"Forrest Gump\\", and it kept us cool for nearly two hours. It had everything. This was a time of taking risks and pushing big names into theaters - now, well, (and one could argue \\"thankfully\\") that recycled magic has gone. A film like this could not exist today. The \\"safe\\" nature of this film would be pushed aside for quirky camera footage, younger actors, and less tears with more violence. Audiences have changed, and while I have grown up beyond the \\"Ransom\\" excitement, I was feeling this love/hate relationship with this film.<br /><br />In 1996, when this film was being released, I was first being introduced to cinema. I was going to theater at any opportunity, I was being pulled into these less-than spectacular situations, and people like Gibson, Sinise, Russo, and Howard were idols because of what they could accomplish on screen. But like any child, I was pulled into the glamour, the hype, and the glitz, while in retrospect, the basics were being missed. Watching \\"Ransom\\", now thirteen years later, it just doesn't seem like the type of film that deserved wide release. Watching this film today, it felt more like a superimposed made-for-TV movie than a blockbuster. To begin, director Ron Howard was out of his element with this film. \\"Apollo 13\\", \\"Blackdraft\\", \\"Splash\\", even \\"Willow\\" seems to be more nature based dramas, so to feel him helming this violence-based drama, it just felt staged and unfocused. In the director commentary, Howard discusses how he attempted to use POV shots to convey the story and develop his characters, and while the idea was present, the execution just felt phony. The juggle between Gibson and Russo's perspective at times felt dizzy to the viewer. Yes, the details around a kidnapped child have that effect; it creates havoc for the viewer - ultimately missing stronger themes throughout. That isn't to say Howard didn't have some powerful shots with his cinematographer, overall \\"Ransom\\" just missed the strength behind the camera. Then, as if to overcompensate for this, Howard allows his actors to overpower the screen with their over-the-top characters. Gibson, a wealthy airline tycoon, goes from passive father to vengeful cynic (a la \\"Payback\\") in a mere instant, allowing - sadly - more drama to unfold between Russo and Sinise.<br /><br />Who was the central focus of this film? This is an excellent question for Mr. Howard as well as the cast. Is Gibson the main character? Is his child the main character or merely the developing plot? Is the wooden Delroy Lindo a major player, or is Sinise just trying to keep up with Gibson's anger? Valid questions that, alas, cannot be answered by this film. \\"Ransom\\" attempts to bring too many twists and turns into an already filled suitcase, and the end result is catastrophe. If this would have merely been a story about Gibson reacting to the capture of his son, and Sinise never being revealed until the end, then \\"Ransom\\" would have successfully accomplished with what it set out to do. The pivotal ending would have been more controlled and dramatic, that this would have made this normal film stand proud. Instead, Howard incorporates two \\"family\\" dramas together, the Gibson family, and the jumbled undeveloped Sinise family whom includes Lili Taylor, Liev Schriber, Evan Handler, and Donnie Wahlberg. Again, this would work well on paper if we would have the opportunity to see via each perspective, but we do not even within the two hours. Therefore it becomes further unfocused, and disruptive to the central conflict.<br /><br />Finally, the last twenty minutes were mere fluff. Not to give away plot, but it felt like it was placed there for those wishing Gibson would provide some much needed action to the screen. Nothing that developed, nothing that revealed, nothing that enhanced, merely staged action for a drunk with Hollywood money audience. It was shameful.<br /><br />FILM: One viewing. That is all you need with \\"Ransom\\". Your knowledge of the plot, what happens, and the overdramatic ways of all the actors/characters can only take one viewing, before it just becomes dull. This is not a repeat film. As mentioned, due to the high profile of the actors, this just seemed out of everyone's league - from the director to the cast - and the bombardment of plot holes (aka Jackie Brown) ensures further sales in the dollar bin.<br /><br />VISUAL: Another lacking department. This film (watched Special Edition DVD) felt like an old VHS with blurred images, grainy background, and dark exteriors. The transfer was extremely poor, hoping that one day a HD release of this film will happen, but again - what is the point?<br /><br />SOUND: Composer Howard Shore wrote and recorded a full score, which was rejected by director Ron Howard and replaced with a new one by James Horner. Enough said.<br /><br />EXTRAS: Decent extras on this disc. A \\"What Would You Do\\" segment that discusses the power of Ron Howard's ability behind the camera. Another one that takes us behind the scenes to see what it was like doing the dramatic points as well as the humor of the cast. An international trailer. Finally, director commentary by Mr. Howard himself. This is interesting and provides some technical detail, but Howard leaves gaps between information allowing us to basically watch the movie again. Not good.<br /><br />Overall, I disliked \\"Ransom\\". When I first began this review, I was in a love/hate relationship, but as I wrote I found more issues with this film. The lack of development between minor characters, the entire Jackie Brown subplot was embarrassing, and the scene in which Russo visits the church just wasted my time. The transitions between scenes and plots were lacking, which I blame directly on Howard's inability to control what was happening. He had a strong focus, but the execution is where it faultered. I do not see myself watching this film ever again - and ultimately will smile when seen on late night TV or in the dollar bin - that was the feel of \\"Ransom\\".<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****two hours.

B002GMNLLA|5.0|Insomnium is by far the best of melody and Death Metal. This album is beautifully done, its even better then there previous albums, in that they changed the tempo a bit and added a few \\"soft-core\\" or non-dark vocals. The melodies are also very deep and atmospheric, the music will take you to another place.      I'm not the best at reviews, but I have never heard any band compare to Insomnium, before, and still. There melodies and dark lyrics are just indescribable to me. If anyone is a fan of Melodic Death Metal, you need to get this. Even a Death Metal fan, who's looking for more in there music other then drums and guitar should give this a go. A++ music

B000006MS3|4.0|hI don't have the same feelings of others have, that this is Kate's best and I don't think it's a  bad album either. I DO think it has some amazing gems that save it: Houdini, The Dreaming, Suspended in Gaffa, Night of the Swallow, and Get Out of My House. It was a hard sell for me, but I have grown to love it quite a lot. I think it is one of those albums that exists better as a record than it does a cd or a download. I have to say, listening to the sides on vinyl and hearing the divides between one half of the album and the other is very interesting. I still enjoy the b-side much better, starting from The Dreaming and winding the album down all of the way to the end. Just when you think you can't get creeped out any further, Get Out of My House ends and you hear the hiss of the end of the vinyl.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|One of the all time great CDs.  If you like Roy Orbison you have to have this in your collection.
0691126658|4.0|I purchased this book for an upcoming birding trip to Africa.  The plates are very well done and it will be very helpful as a birding field guide.  From a personal standpoint, I like to have a book with color plates in one section, and text in another so that I can cut out the color plates and have them re-bound into a 'smaller' guide to take into the field.   The way that this book is designed (text/maps on left page, plates on right) makes it impossible to 'pare down' the book.  This just makes it heavy to bring into the field with you.  Others may appreciate not having to hunt through the text section for range maps, as many birds have VERY similar appearances, but are range restricted to certain sections of the country.    Overall, a great field guide and it will be tremendously helpful in the field.  mv
0061703257|5.0|This is the first book that I've read by Dennis Lehane and now I'm gobbling up the rest!  This book grabs you and doesn't let go. The ending was one of those, \\"I didn't this THAT coming!\\".  Would recommend to anyone who wants to be scared spitless after lights out....
B000007MVL|5.0|Underrated as far as I am concerned, all of the tracks that didn't make it onto The Kick Inside. These remain some of my favourites of all-time. Kashka from Bagdad is heart breaking, Coffee Homeground is a hilarious Marlene Dietrich homage, In Search of Peter Pan is nostalgic, Wow is fun and Oh England my Lionheart is sad and very touching. The only song I cannot stand is The Warm Room. Hammer Horror is also a winner for me. Very fun and very quirky album.

B002MW50KO|4.0|I've had this album one day and have listened to it more times than I have his last album Together Through Life, which I thought was okay but found to be a generic modern-day Dylan album (some minor key blues, some rewritten tunes from other artists, some attempted crooning).  Christmas in the Heart is not perfect - Bob's \\"O Little Town of Bethle-Phlegm\\" voice occasionally struggles to reach the right notes, and he sometimes seems so intent on singing the actual melody, he can't quite invest the proper amount of emotion in the songs - but this album is warm and sincere.  It makes me smile.  The retro sound makes me remember what Christmas used to feel like when I was a kid, and gives me hope that someday Christmas will feel like that again.  My favorite tracks: \\"Must Be Santa\\" (Bob's actually having fun!), \\"Christmas Blues\\", \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" and \\"Christmas Island\\". Those who don't get Dylan, especially latter-day Dylan, will hate this album or write if off as a joke, and that's fine with me.  Dylan always has been an acquired taste.  As for me, I'm loving this album. Thank you, Bob, for this early Christmas gift.
B00000DQSS|5.0|This is my favourite Kate Bush album. Babooska, Delius, Egypt, The Wedding List, Breathing and Infant's Kiss are amazing. One of her under-rated albums for sure.
0060594896|3.0|The book was great and I thought that it would be good to do the coaching. After an emotional hard sell. I was having some bells and whistles go off, but I thought, roll with it... Like jack says. On the phone I was told that these were jacks personal coaches. Come to find out, the same company does Robert Kiyosaki's \\"personal coaching\\". I googled all of my coaches and they had no street cred whatsoever.<br /><br />It was incredibly disappointing and a waste of time. Not to mention, I felt like a sucker for not trusting my gut and calling them on the carpet throughout the whole process.<br /><br />Buyer beware. If it sounds too good, it is!!!
B002GZQYMK|3.0|Quite a polished product, the dramatic rock trio's fifth studio release attempts to ride a wave of ongoing American popularity by continuing to streamline their passionate approach further, and while the album is full of good material, one can't help but see the shadows of former glory in the very compositional parallels themselves.
B000002UAC|3.0|Although I have Meet the Beatles on 7\\" Reel in Stereo from its  very early release, I never bought the first 4 CD releases in   Mono. This is a Brazilian copy made in 1990 by EMI. So, maybe   it was a better version. It sounds clean, full bodied. Natural  highs and plenty of deep bass. The reason for me to change to  Mono now, I finally agree with George Martin on the oddity of  vocals on one track and instruments on the other, at least for  this one. Bought the remastered Please Please Me and find it OK  in Stereo, don't ask me why. My guess is I didn't have a Stereo  LP version of PPM and only played the Mono version for 40 years.  This Amazon buy was very inexpensive, brand new and arrived fast.
B000002U9E|5.0|Amazing album. Cloudbusting is a stand out for me. Kate Bush at her best with her best vocals being used.Thumbs way up.
076781326X|4.0|I grew up hearing about this wonderful film called OLIVER! even before I ever heard of a Charles Dickens novel called OLIVER TWIST.      I recently read OLIVER TWIST for the first time and decided it would be fun to watch different film adaptations of the novel as well.  I watched three in all: this one, the David Lean version, and the Roman Polanski version.  While the Roman Polanski version was truest to the novel, none of the three followed the novel very closely.  And while all three had different qualities (and all three are well worth seeing for different reasons), only OLIVER! kept me glued on account of its magical feel and Dickensian nostalgia.      Sure, it had top notch acting and incredible cinematography; but these compliments were well earned by the other two aforementioned adaptations.  But since it was a musical, OLIVER! also had songs that seemed to bring forth memories that I didn't know I had.  I had never seen the movie before.  And I had never heard any of the songs in their entirety as best as I can remember.  But there was a strong familiarity in several of them: \\"Food, Glorious Food\\", \\"I'd Do Anything\\", \\"Who Will Buy?\\", and \\"Consider Yourself\\".    As is the case with even the greatest of musicals, a few of the songs go on for a very long time (i.e. \\"Who Will Buy?\\") -- sometimes, so long that you may find yourself reaching for the remote.    But in the end, OLIVER! surprised me: I was not looking for a wonderful classic musical.  But I'm glad I found one.
0451450523|2.0|I'm a fantasy fan, and picked this book up because of it's popularity. People had kept asking me if I'd seen the movie. And if I ever did, I don't remember it.   The unicorn was an interesting character, but became a huge let down and bore when she was 'turned'. I won't spoil it. I found myself expecting more depth to the story, and wanting more background and tales on it's creatures. But there was very little.  It felt like a partially finished manuscript that had a thread of a good idea.  I had to ~make~ myself finish it in the hopes that it would redeem itself. Which it did not. I will not be recommending this to anyone.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|No, this is not a flop.  This was the first AF album I bought and upon the first 3 or so listens I was very worried.  I disliked the tone of the music, I had a few headaches, I couldn't enjoy it because the music was kinda quiet but when I turned it up I enjoyed it even less.  But, thankfully, I didn't give up, I had spent money on the physical album (only reserved for my very favorites# and wasn't going to admit I had made a bad decision.    I then did something brash.  I bought Funeral.  I liked the sound, I felt good about listening to it for twice as long as I would have listened to Neon Bible just to make up for it.  Then I put Neon Bible back on, and it was great.  Better than Funeral now that I had digested it, the orchestrations were more complex, the hooks were cleaner, the sound was grander.  Just some back story to my review if you were turned off at first, o and Funeral and Neon Bible are about on the same level for me right now, dunno which I like more.  Now for Neon Bible:    Black Mirror is my least favorite track, I listen to it b/c its epic, but it lacks a lasting/growing appeal for me.  Keep the car running is amazing, even though it has a pop sensibility to it, it still holds an epicness to keep you going for repeat listens.  Neon Bible is short and sweet#well short) and gives a little segue into the meat of the album.  Intervention is pretty good and it has its highs and lows but the following 5 tracks I disliked very much until my return.  The next 6 tracks are simply amazing. Black waves, Ocean of Noise, Well and Lighthouse, antichrist, Windowsill, No cars go are all stunning and Body is a cage is a killer closer. Of all the tracks, my favorites are Windowsill, 2 Cars songs, and Well and Lighthouse, but it'd be hard for me to identify them outside of the album run through to be honest.
0061914177|4.0|Gary Vaynerchuk's new book, \\"Why Now is The Time to CRUSH IT! Cash in on Your Passion,\\" surrounds his relatively quick and calculated rise to personal branding fame and the opportunity that is newly available to everyone in today's restructured digital society.  In the book, Gary states that he lives by three simple rules:    Love your family.  Work Superhard.  Live your passion.    With this, he says, you will find ultimate happiness and success.    The main theme of the book is identifying and pursuing your true passion, with a focus on the current (free) social media tools available to all of us.  Although these channels may change as rapidly as they've been created, the strategy for success remains the same, \\"If you spend most of your life time working, then it better be for something you love,\\" warns Gary.    Gary was an entrepreneur from the very beginning, creating a \\"personal brand\\" on everything he did, from his franchised lemonade stands to his baseball card trading empire. Soon, he was working at his parents liquor store in Clark, New Jersey which he later grew into a $60 million business.  The book explains why we should all be able to do the same (if we're truly crushing it, that is).    Gary, with his life-long obsession to one day buy the New York Jets, has used his god-given DNA to pursue what comes naturally to him, and what doesn't even feel like work.  The book points out that we all have different DNA, and it's important to embrace what we're instinctively good at and recognize what we're not.  Authenticity in business is key.    Advertising dollars are going where the eye-balls are, and the eye-balls are moving from print to screens, so if there was ever a time to create a loyal audience online and offer that inventory up to an ad-buying company within your niche-it's now.    In today's world, the gate keepers have lost their power and to succeed, you just need to clarify where your DNA and passion intersect-and be willing to hustle.    For anyone out there looking to motivate their personal and career goals, I strongly recommend this read. I personally plan on gifting it to several people in my life who are in the process of reinventing themselves or are considering new entrepreneurial ventures this year.    Get out there, and start crushing it today!    [Alyson Campbell for It's All Very PR]
B000UBMWG4|4.0|A bit disappointed by the lack of French audio (thought it is written on the box!)

1931559317|5.0|Heaven knows I don't need another star chart, but the other day I received  yet another one after the recommendation of a friend. It was the Pocket  Sky Atlas.    There was something in the descriptor that struck a chord with me.    The one I got I received new, still sealed and in perfect condition.    If I were to change anything, and this is a very petty complaint, I  would rather have seen that the front and back cover were both separate  pages individually bound on the spiral rather than the front merely  being a wrap around from the back.    Also, I found a link mentioning two serious errors in the charts, an  omission concerning part of Corona Borealis and the Virgo Cluster,  however I see nothing wrong with those parts of my Atlas that I received.    Apparently you want the second edition 2006 or later to avoid this very   tiny discrepancy.    The Pocket Atlas is interesting in that it is broken into 8 vertical  sections or orange peels based on Right Ascension, but different in that  each starts at the north pole and works all the way to the south pole,  for just that section (45° sector out of the full 360° sphere), and then  starts back at the north pole again in the next section, rather than  starting at the north and spiraling down to the south pole like a  corkscrew as most other charts do.    At first I had my doubts about that approach but in fact it works quite   well here.    If I am to suggest and do anything, that would be to number each \\"peel\\"  as \\"1\\" through \\"8\\" on the Contents page, then stick a numbered  tab on the first page of each section. this way you could look up the  month or time of year (or time of night) on the contents page, find  which section that date is under, then flip right to that section using  the tab! Or use the back page to look up the particular area of sky by  page number.    The charts themselves are essentially like a Deluxe (Color) Sky Atlas  2000 just shrunk down in size. As such they have the benefit of havingnearly all of the objects and detail of its larger brethren but also  with the liability of getting a little \\"busy\\" and harder to read due to  the crowding and smaller size of symbols needed--- a necessary and  acceptable \\"evil\\" of being both powerful and pocket-able.  But they   manage this very well and the charts remain very attractive and readable.    In the back are cross references for stars, DSO's and the like so that  one can look up NGC 1234 and find out which chart it is on. All in all,  I agree, this may overall become my most often used set of charts, not  because it is my \\"best\\" or my favorite, but because it is perhaps one of  the most well thought out and practical set of charts for at the  telescope (or nightstand) table, for ready and convenient reference.

But I did return the bible for two minor things. (1) the print is too small and (2)the bible is too big.   I think the NIV study bible was perfect in the sense it had the correct amount of resources, and I think the standard NIV font is bigger.  This ESV study bible has just too much in the way of aids.  I really don't want to be lugging all this extra stuff around.  Particularly the information you will only read once and then never look at again.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|This album picks up where the self-titled left off, except that the band sounds recharged and ready to move on from the Layne Stanley era of Alice In Chains. Now those are tough shoes to fill, but I think William DuVall does a great job with his added guitar and his vocals. At times you will believe that he is channeling Layne, especially while harmonizing with Jerry Cantrell.  The music is a perfect mixture of classic Alice In Chains with a few new elements, including more sudden tempo changes and an extra guitar curtesy of William DuVall. And I won't count out the lyrics which are top notch.  Overall, this album definitely lives up to the rest of the bands catalogue. A great record for fans of Rock. A must buy if you are a fan of Alice In Chains!    5 Stars!
B002436WFI|5.0|I'm just sitting here, hyperventilating after a couple of hours of Color of Magic.  What a RUSH!<br /><br />I'm not saying it's perfect (5 stars not withstanding); the editing somehow gives the impression that matters are dragging along at a leisurely pace, whereas, of course, all hell is breaking loose in about 50 different ways.<br /><br />The shifty-eyed Rincewind is set (by the Patrician) to be nursemaid to the colorful Two Flower, who has just invented the genre of The Tourist on Discworld (the fantastic world invented by Terry Pratchett, which is shaped more or less like a rotating LP, with the water forever falling off the edge).  Meanwhile, a dastardly wizard is bent on rising to the top of the Unseen University (of Wizardry) by assassinating every wizard ahead of him. A mystery of cosmic proportions presents itself: why is the Giant Atuin, the enormous Turtle on whose back Discworld is supported, headed on a collision course with an enormous new star?<br /><br />Veteran Discworld afficionados will know that summarizing a Pratchett Plot is an exercise in futility.  Suffice it to note that all sorts of regulars are delightfully introduced, from the Patrician (Jeremy Irons, beatiful!) Cohen the Barbarian (Awesome!) The Luggage (Stupendous!!!) the Head Librarian (Er.  Ook?) and The Broken Drum.  There are transparent dragons, female heroes, and even an enormous Troll, and a floating mountain.  Sean Astin plays the accidental tourist, and does a beautiful job.<br /><br />I think the movie has been brilliantly designed and executed, even if Rincewind is occasionally mildly disconcerting, as though he isn't just an inept wizard, but actually teaches inept wizarding at an acting school.  Still, we must be grateful to David Jason (who portrays Rincewind) because he's one of the producers, and it really is a beautiful job at many levels.  The special effects are just beautifully effective.<br /><br />Some of the peculiarities of the movie are inherited from the book, I believe. The Color of Magic seems to have been the first of the Discworld books, and Discworld doesn't yet have the lived-in feel that the later books have. Where possible, the movie seems to improve on the book.  (Terry Pratchett himself appears as one of the wizards, in case you're interested. There is apparently an appearance by Granny Weatherwax, though I can't think where; possibly in the Rite of Spring).  The Inside Joke feeling some viewers might get is inevitable, since it's so difficult to present such a complex situation in each book, let alone a movie.  I wish they'd got a real Orang-utan, but that's probably asking too much.  (I thought I saw one in Hogfather, but maybe they just had a bigger primate budget.)  It's simple, mad entertainment, but it's probably best to watch it with someone familiar with Discworld, and a strong tranquilizer.<br /><br />Insanely recommended.  Two bananas up!<br /><br />Archhave been the first of the Discworld books, and Discworld doesn't yet have the lived-in feel that the later books have.

031606792X|4.0|What a great ending to a great series of books.  I loved all 4 books and I'm very happy with this ending.  I see some future books (hopefully) on the horizon.  We need to learn more about Jacob and Nessie.  Keep the stories coming, Stephanie.  I am going through Twilight withdrawal.
B0021L8UXU|4.0|Zombieland (Ruben Fleischer, 2009)<br /><br />Just keep telling yourself that Ruben Fleischer is directing his first feature film. You'll have to, because that's very hard to believe. In a twelve-month period that has been chock full of big-budget zombie awesomeness (viz. Dead Snow, Pontypool, etc.), Zombieland holds its own better than any zombedy since Shaun of the Dead. And considering I don't normally like, well, any of the main actors in this flick, that's saying something huge, at least from yours truly.<br /><br />Our narrator is the nameless... oh, wait, they're all nameless. In any case, he's played by the normally tiresome Jesse Eisenberg (Adventureland), who, in the opening scene, gives us a quick rundown of some of the rules one must follow to stay alive when the world has been overrun with the living dead. These rules are accompanied by some very amusing flashbacks to life when the world was being overrun. Here's a warning, and this may be a spoiler, but so be it: think of Zombieland as a post-apocalyptic Saving Private Ryan. The first bit, there's zombies. The last bit, there's zombies. The middle is a lot of tramping around the woods and talking, and if you don't like that sort of thing, bow out now. In any case, eventually, our nameless narrator meets up with an equally nameless, and far more psychotic, zombie hunter (Natural Born Killers' Woody Harrelson, basically reprising his role from that flick). At this point, the two become differentiated by their destinations on this odd road trip: Eisenberg is Columbus, where he has family. Harrelson is Tallahassee. Why Tallahassee? I'm guessing it has something to do with Dale Earnhardt. (Tallahassee has a habit of painting 3s on all his cars. Fits with the redneck-from-hell persona.) Things get really interesting when they meet sisters Little Rock (Little Miss Sunshine's Abigail Breslin) and Wichita (The House Bunny's Emma Stone), which brings up the movie's one (to my nitpicky head) great failing--it never explains why the sisters are going to different places. In any case, the four of them get off to a bad start. Or two. Or three...<br /><br />I normally can't stand that Eisenberg/Cera/etc. brand of oh-so-hip, cynical humor. It works in post-apocalypse-world, though, especially when your foil is the diametric opposite. Nothing about these characters feels forced. Nothing is here just to advance the plot. The relationships between these characters actually work, and they're built the way a film from another country would build them, rather than with the silly emotional shortcuts so common in Hollywood. (There's a scene about two-thirds of the way through the film that will provide you all the evidence you need in this regard, even if you do see it coming.) Even the talky bits don't get too slow. So grab yourself a banjo and nut up or shut up, because Zombieland marks the third--yes, the third--zombie flick liable to make my ten favorite movies of the year. Judging by the IMDB response, I'm not at all alone in that. ****the sisters are going to different places. In any case, the four of them get off to a bad start. Or two. Or three...

0618918248|5.0|I think i was about 7 years old having discovered the wonders of dinosaurs and their existence over millions of years, that lead me to being a closet atheist. But having had to sit through the boredom of church as a child i guess i had it drummed in to me through various sources that God is good and everything else is bad. Thankfully under a moderately christian mother and Atheist father and the with the assistance of The God delusion I discovered that it is nothing to be ashamed of and that God is not all that good.      I don't suppose anyone who still believes the world is less than 10000 years old will ever open the cover of books such as these but to all those with an inkling of curiousity and intelligence this book comes highly recommended. Unfortunately for the fundamentalists a childhood of \\"brainwashing\\" makes the most logic of arguments almost impossible to sink in, but for those fortunate enough to have had a mixed upbringing this is certainly gives a pathway to bringing up their old children: that is to question everything, and be skeptical of people telling you something is true because I said so and ill get very angry and condemn you to hell if you dont.       As Dawkins points out in more colourful language the God of the bible is one of the most evil villains in literature happily supporting murder, rape, incest, slavery and various other attrocities. Yet people claim to gain their morals from this book with morals so obviously meant as Isrealite propaganda 2000 years ago. Most moderate Christians admittedly, chose morals that appeal to them in the bible proclaiming love for thy neighbour etc, but the question is asked, there is nothing to say in the bible or the Koran to say this part is good that proclaims peace and being kind to your fellow man, or this part which proclaims stoning of homosexuals or killing of infidels. Unfortunately many fundamentalists often take the parts they like which can be interpreted to support flying a 747 into a building to gain access to limitless virgins, or to kill an abortion Doctor with a rich life of memories, family and friends to preserve a handful of unwanted cells.     The God delusion has taught me among other things too:  1. It is more moral to be good to your fellow man as an atheist, rather than one doing good deeds to please the overhead policeman.  2. Any member of any religion should not be giving any specials rights against criticsm, or a voice in the various parliaments of the world due to its backward philosophys.  3. It is appalling to label our children as a muslim or christian child as if they had any say in the matter. We dont label children \\"labour\\" or \\"conservative\\" children.  Bring up your children so they can see all the facts, and if they are not blinkered and confined to 1 book they will undoubtedly reject these false prophets. More so dont permanently traumitise them with visions of hell and fire and brimstone.  4. Speak up and be proud to be a free thinking, rational, logical member of the public and reject the notion that your life is controlled and overseen by a God, or worse one of the many proclaiming themselves to speak directly through God.  5. Faith is not a virtue, there is nothing to be proud of faith in something were there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary. In fact faith in the wrong hands so often causes many of the attrocities we see today.        In response to other readers, Dawkins as any good scientist doesn't claim that there is absoluteley 100% no chance of the existence of some kind of higher power but countless evidence continues to bring that figure ever closer.        However the rantings of a hodge-podge book compiled 2000 years ago by a group of camel herders, heavily plagiarised and so poorly edited with glaring flaws and inconsistencies,does not stand up to any great evaluation and can and should be laughinly pushed aside.  We should no longer have to be dictated too (or oppressed)by anything so glaringly false andthe deluded ideas of its followers.
B0021L8UVC|2.0|Pandorum (Christian Alvart, 2009)<br /><br />All the comparisons everyone and their mothers are making when reviewing this film, and no one seems to have lit on the same one I did: Paul W. S. Anderson's gorgeous, if ultimately minor, film Event Horizon, to which this is a brother in just about every way. It is, however, not the brother I think anyone was expecting; while kind of lovable, it's still hideously deformed, and will likely bite your toes off if you get too close.<br /><br />Alvart (who is currently giving the Hollywood-remake treatment to his own film Antibodies) gives us the tale of a couple of astronauts, Payton (Dennis Quaid, whose dance card has been filled with awful films for the past few years) and Bower (3:10 to Yuma's Ben Foster), who wake up on a spaceship to discover that Earth seems to have disappeared while they were on their way to colonize a new planet, Talos, with fifty thousand pieces of human cargo. Problem is, none of the rest of the crew seems to still be on the ship, so Payton and Bower have to figure out what happened to them, and what jeeps making those nasty noises coming from the air vents. Eventually they find out they're not the only survivors, but... let's not soil it, in case you do decide to see this mess.<br /><br />The movie is going for the heavy-atmosphere feel, and for the first half-hour or so, while this is still a two-person gig, it works. After that, it becomes your basic survival-horror romp (think another Anderson movie, Resident Evil, meets Dark Star, but with aliens who are nowhere near as cute as the latter's beach-ball-with-claws).  Some really nice ideas to be found here (especially concerning the title; if you don't know what it means yet, I won't spoil it for you), but the writer decided to abandon the intelligent bits early on and go for the cheap thrills. A big mistake, IMO, but the movie is still worth seeing for the first half-hour of Foster's performance, at least. **
B000007VCM|5.0|1985 was a great year for music. It was the year of 4AD explosion of some truly special music. Love & Rocket released their phenomenal first album Seventh Dream Of Teenage Heaven. Cure released their Head On The Door, The Damned their Phantasmagoria, Legendary Pink Dots - Asylum, New Order - Low Life and on a bit different fronts Marillion released my favorite album of theirs Misplaced Childhood. Brian Eno gave birth to Thursday Afternoon (a great piece of music for people who want to run away from music) and Ry Cooder's Paris, Texas and Ravi Shankar's Song for Everyone are great as well. However, the dearest album to my heart back then was Love by The Cult. I also find this album to be one of the most magical albums I have ever had, because for whatever strange reason every week or so a different song on this album was becoming my favorite song. I am usually not like that. It does not take me very long to figure out which damn song is best, but Love for me was a changing environment. 24 years later (and I have not listen to this album more than maybe 10 times in the last 20 years but I don't need to, these songs are with me forever as most of music I get obsessed about and listen to 100 times or so in a matter of weeks over and over) I would say that Black Angel is and always had been the greatest. Ian's vocal and lyric are just incredible. Brother Moon Sister Wolf, Revolution, Big Neon Glitter, Rain, Nirvana, these were all my favorites at some point, but I also liked Hollow Man, and wait... I have left behind She Sells Sanctuary, the most famous song of the album. It was a great dance song I admit, but yes, my favorite songs and the greatest hits usually do not match well. Love is a great album, and to me The Cult's best by far. As I was very disappointed by their change of direction after Love I happened to change my own directions a couple of years later and our roads did not cross again. I did want to compile their songs a couple of years ago but I did not find enough excellent songs aside from Love to do it with. I like Ciao Eddie and a few others but...why no more Black Angels?d enough excellent songs aside from Love to do it with. I like Ciao Eddie and a few others but...why no more Black Angels?
B00275EHCI|2.0|Surrogates (Jonathan Mostow, 2009)<br /><br />September 2009 is going to be remembered not as a particularly bad month for movies, but a month in which many movies with a great deal of potential got released. All of them, or at least all of them that I have seen, have been spectacular failures when measured up against the potential of their collective premises; in that light, Surrogates is far less of a disappointment than it would have been had I not already seen such highlights as Pandorum.<br /><br />Bruce Willis, who's doing just as good/bad a job at clinging to his action-star days as is Nicolas Cage, plays Tom Greer, an FBI Agent who finds himself with the unenviable task of tracking down the first murderer in five years. You see, most people are basically unkillable these days; 98% of the population stays at home, wired into the net, interacting with the rest of society through he use of surrogates (think androids here). While there are some other folks in this movie you'll recognize--Ving Rhames plays the leader of the anti-surrogate band known as the Dreads, while Radha Mitchell plays Willis' partner, as a sampling--this movie lives and dies on the character of Tom Greer.<br /><br />And that is its major problem. Bruce Willis is almost comatose throughout most of this movie. Calling his performance \\"flat affect\\" would be a kindness. Kind of makes sense when he's tooling around in a plastic body, and that would work, but during the time when he's actually wandering around as a human, he doesn't get any more emotional. (Worse, Greer-the-surrogate is actually more emotional than most of his compatriots, which makes the distinction even more blurry.) Rhames, as he's been doing in many roles recently, seems to be playing everything camp, going way, way over the top every time he's on screen. (Normally that would annoy me, but both in Day of the Dead last year and here, it allows him to steal the show.) There are some wonderful ideas here, and a few of them are actually carried off (I loved the asides about people slipping into cheaper surrogates without as many features), but the main thrust of the film never achieves ignition. It ends up being a long sting of mindless action sequences tied together by far too few pieces of film that looked like they were from another movie--one that was worth your time. **oved the asides about people slipping into cheaper surrogates without as many features), but the main thrust of the film never achieves ignition.

B00000AOUD|5.0|This is by far my most favorite album of Jethro Tull. To be very honest I was mostly listening to entire albums of their music as they were coming out and I was growing up in the 70's and early 80's. Thick As A Brick was not only my first Jethro Tull album, but it was one of the very first albums in my collection.  Thick as a Brick was a concept album, basically one song unlike anything else they have done, mixing hard rock with classical and folk music. It is a very strong piece of music of great structure and complexity and to me it is one of the most interesting pieces of its kind. Thick As A Brick was a true statement by Jethro Tull and it still speaks volumes today in 2009. Ian's vocals are great and the lyrics supposedly written by the 8th year old Gerald Milton Bostock are very intriquing. There is so much meaning in them that I find it hard to believe they were really written by an 8th year old...Anyway, if some of you are, like me, attracted to the softer side of Jethro Tull's music, you may like some of my favorite songs of Jethro Tull: Requiem, Elegy, From A Dead Beat To An Old Greaser, Thick As A Brick, Aqualong, Wond'ring Aloud, Moths, The Chequered Flag, Home, Fly By Night, Heavy Horses, Cheap Day Return, Nursie, Slow Marching Band, Cherio, Reasons For Waiting, Too Old For Rock'n'Roll Too Young To Die, Grace.

B00004ZD69|5.0|The music is symphonic, although only a few members of the orchestra showed up today... The theme is solemn perhaps even tragic but so is our present state of earthly affairs, so we find ourselves quite comfortably on this ground. The lyrics come to us straight from the soldiers of their battle fronts. Their voices might not be the purest but... their thoughts and feelings seem to be. The overall atmosphere this music spreads upon us, although quite somber, brings us comfort of levels with nowhere to fall from. We are walking the walk with Godspeed You Black Emperor and more we do more we want to stay there in this... strange place. It seems hard to believe the place did not exist before this great Canadian band created it.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|Here is the first ever album called Ambient, as Brian Eno had decided to call that the music he had been making for a while prior to 1978. Discreet Music from 1975 is his first ambient music album, aside from the name. Brian's collaboration with Cluster from 1977 called Cluster & Eno is a great ambient album as well. Music For Airports...Such a great idea, to play this music at airports, bus terminals, train stations. Who knows, perhaps a taxi company playing mellow repetitive music of Brian Eno in their cars would be a success... There was a time in my life when I needed to develop some distance between myself and music. That space was filled by Brian Eno's ambient albums, and Music For Airports is one of my favorite Brian Eno's albums, next to Thursday Afternoon, On Land, Bell Studies For The Clock Of The Long Now, Music For Films, Neroli, Discreet Music and Apollo Atmospheres And Soundtracks. If you like ambient music of this nature here is what else I would recommend; Jean-Michell Jarre -En Attendant Cousteau (title song only); James Johnson & Robert Scott Thompson - Forgotten Places; Kuhlman Rehberg Mense - The Sunken Road; Klaus Schulze - Irrlicht; Labradford - E Luxo So; Dead Texan; James Johnson & Steven Philips - Lost At Dunn's Lake; Pete Namlook & Tetsu Inoue - 2350 Broadway 3; Pete Namlook - Air 2; Recycle Or Die; Labradford - Mi Media Naranja; Klaus Schulze - Body Love; Zoviet France - Shouting At The Ground; Wiese Klaus - El-Hadra; Vidna Obmana & Sal Rosenthal - Terrace Of Memories; Gavin Bryars - Sinking Of Titanic; Alio Die & Mathias Grassow - Expanding Horizon; Popol Vuh - Hosianna Mantra; Harold Budd - Pavilion Of Dreams; Sigur Ros (..); Aphex Twin - Selected Ambient Works Volume 2; David Sylvian - Approaching Silence; Rapoon - The Kirghiz Light; Ultra Milkmaids - V/S Part 1; as well as many other albums where elements of great ambience are just part of equation; Godspeed You Black Emperor - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven; Harold Budd & Eraldo Bernocchi - Music For Fragments From The Inside; Pieter Nooten & Michael Brook - Sleeps With The Fishes; the music of Craig Armstrong (The Space Between Us and As If To Nothing), John Serrie (Planetary Chronicles and The Stars Go With You); Vangelis (1492, Conquest Of Paradise and The City and many others).

0671027344|5.0|The Perks Of Being A Wallflower  by Stephen Chbosky was suggested to me by a young man on my Gather site. He explained that it was one of his and his friend's favorite books and it now has become a staple on my bookshelf to share with the young people in our family.<br />The title explains exactly what the book is about. A coming of age study that is difficult to put down once you begin reading.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|I have been listening to Porcupine Tree for the last 15 years, ever since The Sky Moves Sideways came around and they are one of my favorite present rock bands, next to Radiohead, RPWL, Sylvan, Mostly Autumn, Pendragon among others. When I say present I mean newer generation. A lot of bands I love still tour and record, but their greatness is a bit behind them. Watching Porcupine Tree and Steven Wilson's career I see them leaving a mark as deep as Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd, Joy Division or King Crimson. Steven Wilson is one of my favorite present vocalists. He is a great song writer, guitarist and keyboardist as well as phenomenal studio producer. Steven's No Man project (Together we're Stranger and Schoolyard Ghosts are my favorite) should assure us all that he is the master of atmosphere creation with all instruments. For me Porcupine Tree meant mastery of beautiful mellow ambient moods and soft space rock, picking up amazingly where Pink Floyd left off. Then the harder aspect of Porcupine Tree developed and both In Absentia and Fear Of A Blank Planet came into existence. How many territories can Steven master? That is a good question. He had definately turned my listening trends from very ambient to rather heavy. And now we got this album. After a first couple of listens I Drive The Hearse was my favorite song of The Incident. I was very intrigued by this album, so I took it with me on my recent business trip to Europe and ended up spending about 20 hours driving and listening constantly and exclusively to this cd. First just to a few songs over and over and then I gradually started liking more and more music on it. I have to say that right now my favorite song of this album is Drawing The Line because it is so twisted and powerful( in Steven's words \\"cinematic but crude\\"), although perhaps a bit spiritually disturbing. Kneel And Disconnect is such a great introduction to Drawing The Line. I still love I Drive The Hearse. Its darkness does not bother me because Steven's darkness is usually full of light deep inside. Another spectacular song of this album is Time Flies which contains one of these magic moments of time disruption in it. Another song which just kept on growing on me is The Incident, but listening to it while driving near Munich at 200 kilometers an hour is not a good idea. It freaks you out too much...Steven's darkness is usually full of light deep inside.

B000007SPU|5.0|This album should be a part of everybody's 100 disc collection regardless of if it is a mostly classical or heavy metal collection of music. This is simply one of the most ambitious projects put together. The concept is strong, songs are beautiful, arrangements incredible and the mood created is fantastic. I have heard very recently that Ivo Watts Russell presently lives on the East Coast of US where he has opened an animal shelter. It sounds like again he must be getting a lot of satisfaction out of his life's work. At 4AD he had established a home for Dead Can Dance, Cocteau Twins, Clan Of Xymox and others, but This Mortal Coil's Filligree & Shadow could be the brightest jewel Ivo has generated. Please give it a chance, unless you are afraid it might be too artsy for you.
B002JODUI4|5.0|I kinda liked deadmau5, after listening to this album i'm beginning to appreciate the true genius behind the mau5.

B000006UNG|5.0|One of the best albums ever composed. That is what Talk Talk's Colour Of Spring will always be to me. One of the best 10 albums among the 5,000 I have kept. You have to listen to it a few times (7 is a good number) before you quite get there but I can assure you, no matter what is your musical background, you can get to love this music. It is melodic and uplifting, acoustic and atmospheric, peaceful and perfect.<br /><br />Happiness Is Easy is a perfect song to listen to on Sunday morning around 10 am, if you are at home or alone and feel like surrounding your spirit with harmony. Stay within this song for a while. Although Mark's lyrics leave it a bit open as far as his take on things the feeling this song will place upon you...leaves no doubts. This is one of the most spiritually uplifting songs in rock music. The choir of Children From The School Of Miss Speake is a great addition to this song. I find it more special than the choir in Jerusalem by Vangelis of even Mike Oldfield's work, and the only song I know which exceeds the power of a similar expression is Jan Garbarek's We Are The Stars. The Colour Of Spring is a very exceptional album in terms of talent it brought together. There are 16 musicians and 2 choirs involved here and none of the songs were recorded by the same line up. Happiness Is Easy, for instance, has 10 musicians playing and a choir singing, and the instruments involve drums, 3 sets (and players) of percussion, acoustic bass, electric bass, organ, piano, guitar and effects. Steve Winwood plays organ here and on 2 other songs. I Don't Believe In You is another great song and we have an addition of harp and soprano saxophone here. This spectacular orchestration of this music is what makes it such an unique rock album. Here Mark's words could be directed towards all of us or he could be addressing himself, but no matter how he says it, the spirituality of the music is enormous. Life's What You Make It takes us to the song April 5th which relates more towards Mark's future music. More withdrawn and abstract. The lyrics of April 5th, directed towards spring, are a perfect study of his poetic style. `Let me breathe the colour of spring'...the way he sings his words at the end of this song, by almost breathing them back and forth and distorting the voice to complement the guitar sounds and adding texture to the ambience of our experience is truly amazing. The total instrumentation of this song consists of Mark's voice, soprano saxophone, 2 variophons, organ, piano and dobro. This is the atmosphere building at its best which David Sylvian excels at as well. Living In Another World is a completely different song in terms of rhythm and texture but lyrically...all doors still were left open. Mark's lyrics keep on asking us over and over to work out the details of his poetic tales...on our own. Perhaps the following song, Give It Up is a little more direct, towards all of us again. The music of Chameleon Day again takes us to Mark's future and the atmosphere of his later work. It is limited to his vocal, piano and 2 viriophones. It becomes a great moment of peace before the most powerful moment of this album, to me. The music is more beautiful than ever and the Ambrosia Choir this time adds layers to the texture which is upon us. Time It's Time summarizes the message of Colour Of Spring and is a bit more direct...'love is only sleeping wrapped in neglect'; `contempt is ever breeding trapped in itself'; `the wicked and the weeping ramble or run'; and so, `time it's time to live for living' and we are so fortunate to have this beloved album to help us along...<br /><br />The Colour Of Spring was just such an awesome stage of a beautiful progression of Mark Hollis' complete musical development and statement. And yes, all of us sometimes wish that more great albums similar to the ones we consider our jewels would be left behind by artists we love. It is often impossible for them and Mark Hollis happens to be the monument to this statement. This phantastic album at hand is the only message he wanted to express in this unique way. Which songs are best? Again, my favorite ones are Time It's Time, Happiness is Easy, I Don't Believe in You, April 5th, and Living in Another World. What a magnificent album this is.

0307716988|5.0|I think it is fascinating to read about Michael during this time of his life. You get to hear what his childhood was like, but not the vast details we would learn later. Still it shows Michael was a person just like the rest of us, with thoughts, feelings and struggles. I think the thing most forgotten about Michael is that he was a person. Finally, after his passing, his daughter brought that to light when she said he was the best and cried. This was someone's dad.    The book kinda feels like Michael is sitting there with you at the time of the writing, telling you his life story. It's sad he didn't do a follow-up to this book, but I can understand his mistrust with the media. Every word or action of his seemed to always be twisted because someone wants to make money ruining someone else's life.    The pictures are awesome. I was given my original copy of this over ten years ago by a very close friend. It's been one of my prized possessions ever since. The condition is pretty great too. I had to buy this new version just to see the little difference and so I can put aside my old copy as a keepsake. Amazingly, after a bunch of times reading it this book maintained the quality very well. Probably because Michael always demanded quality for his fans. There are lots of concert pics and even a few private pics (thinking about a pic of Michael in front of water back in his Thriller days. He looks as normal (meaning not in concert or working) as I ever have seen him look in this pic). I especially like the pic of him embracing Diana Ross which looks like it was in the year or two before Bad (his skin was starting to lighten from Vitaligo in this pic).     I really wish we could have read a follow-up to this book. I really would have liked to know more from like his Dangerous days, his marriage to Lisa Marie, how his relationships with his brothers and sisters was over the years etc.     Some critics will think this is a light-weight book, but Michael does let us see a glimpse of the bad in his life. He even talked about his relationship with his dad. Michael shows even a hint of ego. I'm recalling this line by memory so don't be upset if I miss a word \\"I could have sued Pepsi for the accident, but I was nice about it. REAL nice.\\" lol Looking back Pepsi should have had to pay for his scalp surgeries in the years to come. From what I hear he was never the same after the fire burned his head.    Michael also had confidence problems at times due to the acne he suffered in the 70's and no doubt from the Vitaligo and Lupus that he must have known about at the time of the writing of the book. I don't find fault in his not sharing this with the world until the Opera interview. Having a disease like Vitaligo alone must be hard to deal with (I have SLE so I completely understand the Lupus part). For such a public figure to deal with something that messes up your looks must have been devastating for MJ.    I'm very glad he wrote this book. After he died I got it out and read it again for like the 20th time, literally. Some lines were hauntingm especially when he talked about collapsing from a lung problem at Jermaine's house on the beach. It made me wonder if he had lung issues after that. I think I had the same thing, a pulminary embolism (blood clot in the lung which can almost kill you, I speak from exprience, think I screwed up the spelling there).     I think I sensed that MJ was kinda disappointed with the Bad album. He mentioned how some of the songs were just \\"jams\\" for that time. He seemed to rush through that at the end unlike how he describes Thriller and some Jacksons albums.    This book will leave you wanting more, but in a good way. Wish there was more, a squel, a diary, a book he might have saved for after his passing. I'm very satisfied with my original and the quality of the book alone lasts through the years with no yellowing of the pages or anything. The pictures hold up just as well. Check out the book cover underneath the dust jacket to see Michael's \\"autograph\\" reproduced in gold ink. The book has two sets of pics where you can unfold to show more pics on each side of the pages. Plus there are black and white pics throughout the book to go along with those nice colored pics that stand out. If you are an MJ fan this is a must-buy. I think it would be a great buy for anyone who ever was a Michael Jackson fan. You will get to know the real him a bit more and maybe understand how his life was. Rest In Peace my brother!    P.S - I am a little careful with my book, but the quality is so good that even the minor \\"incidents\\" doesn't really ruin the book. If you plan on preserving the book, I have to say this is one of the best quality books and I am a huge book-reader and have ton of hardcovers, but this one held up better than any other book I have. One question - Does anyone know what an original 1998 copy of this is going for? I'm not looking to sell it, just wanted to know out of curiosity.
B000024D4R|5.0|Shine On You Crazy Diamond is possibly the most dear piece of music of all times for me but it could very well be The Animals and not Wish You Were Here which is my favorite Pink Floyd album overall. It might have to do with the time distortions they have loaded this one with. Pigs On The Wing are such a spiritual boost. Dogs might be my favorite song here and it used to freak me out how many times while listening to this song back in 1977 and 1978 in my mother's place, with large dogs running around the house, I used to look out the window, forgetting I was hearing the music. And no, I did not do any drugs back then. A few days ago while on a business trip in Europe I was fortunate enough to attend a rock festival in Freising, Germany, where next to the Sylvan episode (the most amazing show by a vocalist I could ever imagine) I had experienced the complete Animals tour repertoire done by RPWL.; it was spectacular. It is interesting that 2 of my 7 most favorite present rock bands, RPWL and Mostly Autumn both came to life as Pink Floyd cover bands, and another one Porcupine Tree is also very heavily Pink Floyd influenced. If you love Pink Floyd and are searching for other great bands, please make sure you know all 3. Another great song on the album is Pigs, but that only leaves one other song, Sheep and that was the starting song of Pink Floyd's Animals tour. Basically it is a great album with phenomenal music and great lyrics.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|Very good component video cable, especially for the price.  It connected snugly into the video component jacks running between the TV and the DVD player and worked fine.  Strong, very well insulated and can be easily separated into three separate cables if need be.  Color coding ensures correct connections.  Packaging was extremely easy to open since it was just a cardboard box with the component cable rolled inside a plastic bag.
B000002MQ9|5.0|Within The Realm Of The Dying Sun is to me the most extraordinary album of Dead Can Dance. It was created in 1987 following by 2 years their excellent second album, Spleen And Ideal. All of their albums were great and whenever they decided they had nothing more significant to say together any more, they had parted their ways. I have to say honestly that at that point or any moment prior to it I had no idea how the balance of force of creation looked on the inside but from where I am standing today in 2009 I will only say that Lisa Gerard is a musical genius. Both, Whalerider and The Insider prove it. Coming back to Within The Realm Of A Dying Sun, it would make a great soundtrack to a movie about us at a funeral (Anywhere Out Of This World starts playing as our movie starts). We are all standing there, one by one coming over to a casket dropped into the ground to throw our handful of soil over it so the story can be shortly over. All of the sudden the most amazing cloud of light starts appearing out of nowhere directly over our heads and it is intensifying it's glow to the point that it shines brighter and much lighter than the sun. We realize that we are looking directly at it and are not blinded by it at all (In The Wake Of Adversity starts playing now). And we are looking at one another, no, not with shock nor fear nor doubt, but with the infectious love, with total unconditional love, because this is exactly what radiates towards us out of this amazing light we now see (as we start hearing Xavier). All of the sudden standing there in the midst of some incredible super-consciousness we realize that we all have seen this light and felt this love before, we know it, many times over the ages. Was it in our earthly lives or in between, during days or in our sleep? Search and you will find, ask and it will be given....Are these the laws of this supernatural state we are in now? These seconds seem to last forever and now we remember seeing angels surrounding us on earth reflecting similar but much dimmer light around us so often centuries ago. Is that why we had painted and sculpted so many of them over our history, because they were one of the realities of our distant lives? Why have we lost connection with the spiritual side of our world? This question is replacing the great disappearing brightness joined by a dim tiny light form of our deceased (Cantara is playing now). And now we realize that we are not watching any movie at all but we are still overpowered by the spirituality of Dead Can Dance and their music and at least I know for sure what music would be the most appropriate soundtrack to my farewell... No, I am not a big fan of cemeteries... Please let the wind spread my ashes under golden gate bridge...as you lay down your sails...And...go ahead and play the 2 last songs i have not mentioned yet, Summoning Of The Muse and Persephone.h reflecting similar but much dimmer light around us so often centuries ago.

B000026258|5.0|This is not only my favorite music by Steve Reich but one of my favorite modern classical albums. Next to Songs From The Trilogy by Philip Glass, Farewell To Philosophy by Gavin Bryars, Symphony Of Sorrowfull Songs by Henryk Gorecki or Tabula Rasa by Arvo Part. Out of all these albums Music For 18 Musicians is of the highest energy and tempo. This music evolves and takes you in. It makes you feel like you are riding a fast and steady moving train through an amazing landscape you seem to be very familiar with after a while. It may feel a little monothonic but these are the rides which allow you to focus on your own real trip so you let the train just take you... I can listen to this music over and over all day; I really like repetitive elements. Good balanced life seems to me to be full of them. If we could just eliminate mistakes... Most of Steve Reich's music is very good and original. My next recommendation would be Different Trains, which is an even more modern approach.
B001AIRUOU|2.0|Update on this movie.  Because of the negative comments posted to my original review, I decided to watch the movie again, on Showtime, in HD-Big screen.  I thought that maybe I missed something.  My opinion has not changed.  I think it's an absolutely terrible movie, and I was a little too generous giving it a second star.  By the way, in this class of movie, I like Coraline the best.<br /><br />Original review:  I watched this via streaming.  The detail was outstanding.  The problem was that as much as I liked Corpse Bride, I disliked this movie.  In Corpse Bride, the characters seemed genuine, and I really sympathized with the two brides.  Loved the dog.  In Nightmare, all the characters were shallow, not developed, and not lovable at all.  Even the dog failed to give me any emotion. Totally bored throughout.  Waited for it to get better, and it never did.  Corpse Bride gave us a detestable evil character, and a surprise ending, Nightmare gave us neither.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I like these workouts. They are very challenging and I could feel the difference in strength after the first four days. It was a brutal start though!   I had to stop in the middle of the 30 days as I hurt my shoulder from all the upper body stuff, push ups etc.  I'm going to go back and finish the thirty days though as I think it's a really effective way to build stamina and strength.
B000B9EY2U|4.0|No matter what others may say, Depeche Mode music is still unique and special, including this album.  Not too many other bands stick together for so long and are still able to create quality music.
0711986746|5.0|I love this book because I wanted to know more about him as a person. I enjoyed reading about his favorite foods and how he decorated Garden Lodge. I've been a BIG fan since 1974 and this is one of my favorite books...and I have almost all of them. Even though I had Jim Hutton's book \\"Mercury And Me\\", I didn't think it was all true. This book seems to be all true and written by his closest employee and friend. Peter stayed loyal too by not writing about any negatives or extremely personal matters.
B001TH7GT6|4.0|I replaced my Monster RCA cable with this one and couldn't detect any difference in picture quality.  Which is to say both pictures looked just fine, but the Monster cable was a lot more expensive.  So I can't see any reason not to buy this cable instead.  It's fairly thick and hefty, but not any more so than most cables.  Just enough that it feels like it has a solid build quality and will last for a while.  One minor quibble is that I did have to push a bit harder than I expected to get the connectors on each end to fit.  Not sure if that means my cable is connected too tightly or if my previous cable was just too loose.  But it's been working fine so I have no complaints.
B002R4K6AG|1.0|Boy, reading all the glowing review of Bob's Xmas. (One 5 star I know was tounge in cheek). I'm mean really. All I know thank God for Zune where at least I can preview this stuff and not pay up front first. I LOVE BOB! So don't get me wrong, so this thing here, Man. C'mon you guys this is crap,I'm sorry. If he at least written some new songs, well maybe. I feel this is something thrown out there for charities sake.Poor Tiny Tim no turkey this Christmas!!
1400034779|1.0|An omnivorous consumer of gentle detective/mystery books, I find the popularity of this series inexplicable. I have read a few, tried to enjoy them, and in the end, put the book down as puzzled as when I started.     The writing is inoffensive (which is in this illiterate age quite an achievement), the detective acceptably eccentric yet just like us, and we can all feel suitably broadminded by reading something set in a part of the world that usually only appears in the bloody bits of the news.     Perhaps it is just too much cleaned and comfortable exotic, perhaps the whole middle-class-white-male writing from black-female-poor perspective (do they take the same frock size even?)annoys me, perhaps it is the use of the ludicrous archaism \\"lady,\\" perhaps it is all the glowing reviews from the \\"I don't normally read detective novels/fiction\\" people (if they don't, how do they know these are any good? they've never read any others), and I am prepared to admit it may just be me, but the greatest mystery about these books is their popularity.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters. It is so hilarious!!! So is the short before it which I hope that they release with the dvd. I didn't see it in 3d though since where I live the theater isn't able to do that. But to me it didn't take away from the movie. Although, I feel I must express an annoyance. I read the reviews and noticed a lot of 1 stars. I read them to realize the only reason they give this movie 1 star is cuz it isn't being released in 3d. SO WHAT!!!!! I didn't see it in 3d do you hear me bitching? The rating is for the movie, not what isn't included on the dvd. So to those who apparantly only care about 3d, I guess wait til the time it does come out. And for those of you who are like me and don't care either way, buy it, enjoy it, and be happy!
B0015ABRE2|3.0|Compared to the first 2 seasons, this one is a little bit of a let down.    The first four episodes look like something out of Desparate Housewives  instead of Dexter....  Too much family problems and not enough killing.    It's funny to see a serial killer putting up with a girlfriend who I would  have personnaly killed a long time ago just for being herself...    Maybe we'll see the nightmare of parenting in the fouth season.  The 3rd is mostly about the nightmare of a pregnant girlfriend.    Disapointing.
0446560065|5.0|This book is really great. Almost better than all the videos of simon's cat.<br />It's interesting to see that futher video will be inspired from the book now.<br /><br />Btw, hilarious:-)
B001CTDH76|5.0|This is a fantastic series. Simon Baker is amazing - handsome, charming, playful, just a joy to watch. The story lines are good, the cast is fun and interact well with one another.
B002E2QHBS|4.0|After waiting a month to receive this, I am not disappointed.  Lots and lots of great music here.  Some bands, however, I think are represented a little too much, while others aren't represented enough.  Also, some of the banter has been edited out from previous versions.  I particularly like the introduction to Joan Baez's \\"Drug Store Truck Drivin Man\\", which was dedicated to \\"the Governor of California, Ronald RAYGUN...ZAP!\\"  Classic, but it's not here.  Nor is the introduction to \\"Sweet Sir Galahad.\\"  I could have used more Joan Baez, more Richie Havens, CSN&Y, Janis, The WHO (especially The Who), and LESS Country Joe and The Fish, the Incredible String Band (really bad), and Canned Heat.  And the Hendrix segment seems edited.  I seem to remember the \\"Woodstock Improvisation\\" and \\"Villnova Junction\\" pieces being longer.  And why play only the end of \\"Voodoo Child\\"?<br /><br />Still, there's so much good stuff on here, it's hard to complain too much.  The best we can hope for is that more artists release their entire performance.<br /><br />Listening, seeing, and reading about this concert, I really wish I had been there, but alas, I wasn't born yet.  There will never be another concert like this.
B002NC8JEC|5.0|I got an early copy of this CD and it's incredible! I love the interpretations of these holiday songs by the Jackson 5. And there are these very special holiday greetings from all the J5 brothers. A great keepsake to hear Michael wishing me a Merry Xmas. He will be missed!
B0029LHW4U|4.0|The mostly positive reviews here intrigued me enough that I purchased this CD a week ago.  Since then, it hasn't left the car CD player.  From my point of view, that's a good start.<br /><br />A few opinions:<br /><br />*)  Definitely sounds and feels like AIC, at least most of the time.  Some exceptions.<br />*)  Seems like an \\"evolved\\" form of AIC music.  More complex.<br />*)  More than a few AIC-style earworms.  Some of these bits will get into your head and it's tough to get them out.  Notable in \\"Looking in View\\", \\"Take Her Out\\" especially, but nearly all tracks have something catchy.<br />*)  Very solid song selection with a variety of styles.  Not always a plus.  Some might find the title track too soft for their taste, while \\"Last of My Kind\\" feels like an escapee track from an 80's hair metal band.<br />*)  Sections of some tracks sound repetitive at times.  Not much, just enough to notice.<br /><br />Wrap:  It's not the same kind of \\"impact\\" AIC album as \\"Jar of Flies\\" or \\"Dirt\\" - but it's good, enjoyable, very replayable... and unquestionably an AIC sound.<br /><br />Update (2010-09-28):  MP3 download for FIVE BUCKS?!  A bargain.  If you haven't grabbed this album yet, get it before this price goes away.  Liking this album more and more as time passes.  Bears many repeat listens.
B0029XFNA8|2.0|Miracle on 34th Street is the best colorized movie in the history of cinema.  This is a CHRISTMAS movie.  Christmas is the most colorful time of the year.  This is a HUGE disappointment . . . they could have easily put both B&W and colorized versions on one blu-ray disc.  What sap in Hollywood made this decision? . . . they just lost tens of thousands of sales because of this major screw up.
0061914177|5.0|I learned about Gary from one of his keynotes from Inman Conference about a year ago.  Been following his wine library shows as well as all of his business videos.  Over the past year, he has encouraged many to follow their passion and live versus earning a living.    In this 140 page book, he goes into the background of where he came from for those of us who do not know the whole story and then leads us into how he turned a business into an empire.  Giving specific examples on how you can take your business to the next level.    Although dissapointed that it was only 140 pages (I did not want additional pages of fluff but rather the read was so good I found myself wanting more and more of this great content) I enjoyed every page.    Looking forward to another book whenever it comes out.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I love this show and I like how they kept it in sequence so I didn't have to keep going back and forth between discs.
B001FB55I0|1.0|This is by far the worst Terminator Movie ever.None of the action of previous movies.No major fight scenes like in the first movie between the robots and humans Lots of talking and no action.If you liked the action in the 3rd one (a lot of people obviously did not by what I have been reading for other reviews)  then stay away from this one. I never fall asleep in movies but I begged for a pillow.lOTS OF PEOPLE SAY THEY LIKED THIS ONE BUT ACTION JUNKIES BEWARE I got your back!!!!!

They all love it; at firs they put it on an umbrella before they got the time to hook it up properly. Little boy love it even knows some of the planets already and likes to listen to the edu part. Deffenetly getting one for me.<br />I am giving it a 4 star for durability just because I still dont know how durable it will be. Overall: very happy with my purchase.
1416594787|5.0|I just finished reading \\"The Greatest Show On Earth, the Evidence For Evolution,\\" the newest offering by Richard Dawkins, the author of \\"The God Delusion\\" and other works.  In the preface, Dawkins said that his reason for writing TGSOE was to lay out all of the evidence for evolution, from all the scientific disciplines, and, speaking as a non-scientist I would have to say he has done exactly that!    While reading along, I had the feeling I was observing a master puzzle-person assembling a vast jig saw puzzle, with a few clues here and a few clues there, slowly but surely building a seamless wall of evidence with fact after supporting fact, at the end leaving no doubt about the truth of evolution by natural selection.  Dawkins made it clear from the very beginning that this was not an anti-god book, for as he said, he has already done that!  Throughout the book, he refers to the anti-evolution folks as \\"the history deniers,\\" a term which I feel is stronger then merely assigning them to one of two opposing (and possibly equal) camps, and places them in the category of those who choose to disbelieve what science considers undeniable fact.    Dawkins takes us on a purposeful romp through many different scientific disciplines, demonstrating how they all work together to prove the wonderful truths of evolution.  We have an exploration of nuclear physics, which, supported by biology and geology provides the clocks by which we measure the vast expanses of geologic time.  We learn that the fossil record, much maligned by the history deniers, is only one of the evidences for evolution, and not even the strongest, even though it is rich and nearly un-assailable.   Dawkins recounts the DNA evidence, which tells us exactly how closely we are related to every other living thing on earth.  He goes into great detail explaining how DNA controls the development of an embryo, how various organs are constructed.  We also learn that various constructs within our bodies are actually evidence for evolution.  For instance, there is a nerve, called the recurrent laryngeal nerve that runs from our brains to our larynx (voice box).  You would think it would go directly, but it actually takes a turn around one of the major arteries leaving the heart, and returns to the larynx after a journey of almost a foot.      All mammals have this same recurrent nerve, and in the case of the Giraffe, it's journey takes it almost fifteen feet our-of-the-way, resulting in an animal that seems to have a very robust larynx but is only able to vocalize short grunts.  This recurrent nerve makes no sense whatsoever if we were \\"intelligently designed,\\" but makes perfect sense if you take into consideration that our ancestors had no necks and gills!      If we had no fossils, no DNA and no chemical evidence for evolution, we could still make an excellent case for Darwin with the evidence provided by the distribution of species, taking into account the former and present positions of the continents. Dawkins shows us why this often-overlooked evidence is important, and how it fits into the overall scheme.    All in all, I think this book is one of the best of its kind, and certainly meets the expectations of the writer.  I recommend it highly, as it is accessible, readable and extremely comprehensive.  Dawkins does a very good job, even in areas where he isn't a recognized expert, in laying out ALL the evidence for what is certainly the foundation of all biology.  I have mentioned only a few of the areas he covers, he managed to teach me a great deal in a few short days, and I need some time for some of the lessons to sink in. Certainly a wonderful addition to the genre.
B0024HH32A|4.0|I've been a fan of MASH (the movie, not the TV show) since I first saw it at about age 14 or 15 on DVD.  Recently, I've been getting into the rest of Altman's movies, so when I saw the blu ray I knew I had to check it out.  If you haven't seen it yet, MASH is a bit of a (pardon me) mash up of a war movie, medical drama, and Animal House.  Okay, it's really just a lot like Animal House.  Some reviews I've seen online have pegged this movie as being sexist and outdated, but the film is really about the attitudes of a bunch of really talented and really bored twenty something male doctors BS-ing and causing trouble.  Unlike the most of Altman's other work, this is very much a guy movie.  I used to think this movie was just effortlessly brilliant and an easy going good time with a bunch of funny actors just doing whatever they felt like.  On subsequent viewing after all these years, I can see just how much Altman's distinctive style had already taken shape in his first film.  The scene towards the ends of the movie in long shot with Hawkeye getting news from Radar is absolutely astonishing in how much it conveys with no words at all.  Even though I still remembered all the jokes and cringed at the awkwardness of some of the characters, I still found myself laughing out loud at some of the more subtle moments.<br /><br />Of course, these little bits might have gone unnoticed had I not sprung for the HD version.  Again, other reviews on the films picture quality range from decent to miserable and the real result is somewhere in between.  Immediately after watching the disc, I popped in the old THX mastered DVD, upconverted by my blu ray player.  I'll admit I was a bit surprised.  The major problem with the blu ray is an excessive amount of blooming on any scenes with white clothing.  They give off a glow a few centimeters out from the characters.  I first thought this was haloing, but no, they were just really bright in comparison with the dark backgrounds.  On the DVD, this effect was a lot less noticeable, but everything else picture-wise was worse.  For one, the image was a lot darker, smudging out a lot of fine detail.  The rest was lost in the digital noise and non-film related pixelated graininess.  However, in stripping away the murk on the blu ray, it revealed Altman's almost vaseline-like filter on the camera and color timing intended to accentuate the drab military greens.<br /><br />The first thing I looked for on the blu ray was just how much grain they did or didn't leave on the image.  Thankfully, they left most of it in, but it does get a little overwhelming at times, with it seeming to snow over background scenery.  There's a lot more surface detail on fabrics and the stubble on the actors' faces stands out a bit more.  There's a scene near the beginning of the movie with nurses looking into a tent giggling that was less apparent on DVD, since it was so quick and more difficult to read facial expressions.  I'm once again going to repeat the mantra of almost every reviewer covering HD movies from the 70's - this is probably the best this movie is going to look.  The main reason I bought this was just to see what 70s Altman movie can look like in high definition.  I assure you that now I'm going to hold out for the HD version of Nashville, instead of buying the DVD.<br /><br />As far as sound goes... well, I honestly couldn't tell you if it was an improvement or not.  I don't have a surround sound system to really put the track to test, but I don't think there can be that much of an improvement over the 5.1 mix on the original DVD.  I do think I could follow the rapid overlapping better than I used to, but that probably just comes from repeated viewing, rather than a real technical achievement.  All of the extras were ported over from the previous disc, which is good, since it was a fairly packed two disc set.  However, there's no real new stuff to be had.  Overall, I'm really just jonesing to see how McCabe and Mrs. Miller, Brewster McCloud, and Nashville hold up on the format.  It may not look perfect, or even that good, but this disc shows just what a little TLC can do towards making great murky-looking 70s films watchable on HD sets.oud, and Nashville hold up on the format.

B000W8OM5Y|5.0|William Wallace, a commoner, is a legend, a myth, a hero for sure in Scotland. In his thirteen century he opposed the rule of the king of England over Scotland and the ruthless colonial attitude of that king and his soldiers. Why a commoner and not a noble? Because the nobles accepted to be paid prisoners, salaried slaves of the king of England. As a commoner he only suffered the ruthless violence from these soldiers and the indifference of these nobles. He started a rebellion against the English and that rebellion actually swept the whole Scotland and climaxed in the battle of Stirling. He had managed to bring the nobles behind the commoners and he got a full victory. He was knighted at once but did not change his logic. So in order to force the king of England to grant Scotland full independence he crossed the border and attacked the English at home. He took and ransacked the city of York, and killed the duke of York, the very nephew of the king of England. But in the next confrontation the nobles betray him and he is defeated after the nobles leave the battlefield. The Bruce gets him off that battlefield in due time. But later on the nobles again will betray him again, attract him in a trap and deliver him to the king of England. He will be duly executed as a traitor. The film evokes that treatment though it remains rather far from the real stuff and the fact that he was executed on the day before the Bartholomew Fair on the Fair ground itself as a festive entertainment added to all the others by the king himself. The point is historical and the film is valuable because of that historical dimension. A commoner could easily bring commoners together and make them fight for their freedom, even their national freedom. That is the birth of popular nationalism, of nationalism as such, the only nationalism that represents some historical progress, that of the people, of simple people. That nationalism is going to develop in Europe over the coming centuries, but we can witness its birth in Scotland here. At the same time the film shows very well that nationalism is in absolute contradiction with feudalism. That nationalism is based on self-pride and individual freedom, and the protection and guarantee of that individual freedom. The right of the first night (the local esquire or noble has the right to make love to the newly wed woman, before her newly wed husband on the evening of their marriage) is one of these unbearable privileges of the nobles. Furthermore, the nobles satisfy themselves very well with the financial dependence on the king of England, as long as it does not question their local dominance in Scotland over the local Scots. They have no real national spirit, and the freedom of the people is not their problem. They have sworn allegiance to the King of England and that guarantees their privileged position and they are quite satiated with that. At the same time we must understand a different approach of feudalism that is no longer very active in our minds. The king was the very secular representative of God due to his appointment by God himself, under the only authority of the Pope who is the direct spiritual representative of God on earth. If such is the reality of feudalism, then no one can question the decisions and acts of the king, certainly not the nobles who are under allegiance towards that king. A duke can fight against a count or another duke, because they are of the level but they cannot fight against the king who is over them. But the surprising element is that the battle of Stirling took place on September 11, 1297 some 80 years after the first signing of the Magna Carta and 30 years after the final acceptance of this Magna Carta that shows how the English nobles and the English Church actually joined against the king to impose onto him some freedoms that were unheard of before. I tend to believe William Wallace was the development of this Magna Carta and that it brought the third social element into the picture, the third estate, the commoners. The defeat is all the more significant, and the execution is also all the more significant. It was more a martyrdom than anything else. We know that a poet, Blind Harry, will turn the oral legend into a myth with his epic poem written at the end of the fifteen century. This film is just the adaptation of this myth.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Vincennes Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Val de Marne Creteil, CEGID Boulogne Billancourticture, the third estate, the commoners.

B0007TKNII|5.0|I have watched this DVD over and over again.  I can't get enough of it.  I did not even know who Gerry Butler was when I first watched this movie yet I was so intrigued by him as he played the Phantom.  My kids even love this movie.  It is a must see!  Trust me.
0385504225|1.0|Really nothing new to add to the torrent of negative reviews - except that its even worse than \\"1 star\\" can indicate.  Simply awful.  Unreadable and hard to believe that the same author who wrote so many enjoyable novels could produce this mess.  I'm absolutely astonished.  I rarely but a book down and it was a battle to get even half way through.  AVOID AVOID AVOID
B001U9BRNE|5.0|I honestly bought this blu-ray concert to watch and hear one specific person sing. After watching the whole program, I started to like the variety of music artists in it. The sound and video is great compared to other concert blu-ray. This is worth every penny. I bought a good amount of blu-ray movies, but, this is the discs I mostly watched repeatedly. I am loving it.
0385504225|4.0|Like his other two hits, Dan Brown fills this novel with numerous codes that must be broken.  Also like his other hits, this book is a page turner, especially the first half.  But the second half of the book becomes somewhat tedious.  The convenient interpretation of codes and low odds survival of main characters become less believable as the story unwinds.  It's fun to read, but it's not nearly as exciting as his DaVinci Code or Angels and Demons.
B001QXE0OC|5.0|I just cant say anything bad about this record. I loved every song in ti. It cant be compared to any other singer, she proved to be unique and she didnt pretend to be a song-writer. I just love selena. buy this album. YOU WONT REGRET IT. :D
0385504225|2.0|I really wanted to enjoy this book.  Like most people I dont think Dan Brown is much of a technical writer, but I enjoyed reading Angels and Demons and The Davinci Code for the ideas they brought across and the sheer thriller aspect of them.      This book has very little \\"thrills\\" in it.   A lot of Browns big reveals about Freemasons and their impact on the United States are pretty tame.   Its certainly less interesting than the things he brings up about the Vatican in the other two Robert Langdon books.      The major issue where I am unable to enjoy this book is how clunky Browns writing style has become.  Half the book is told in flashbacks...and often he will do the high school literature mistake of having a flashback IN a flashback.  Why not tell a linear story, instead of dragging the readers out of the plot as it happens, to add a lot of useless exposition?   Its just plain bad writing, and Brown has succumbed to it entirely here.         His personal cliches are endless here.  Every time a \\"big reveal\\" occurs he drags it out for a full chapter.        Langdon figures something out.......he talks about what he has figured out, without revealing to the reader what he has figured out.   The chapter ends with Langdon running off to confront what he has figured out.  The next chapter starts on a completely unrelated aspect of the book.....THEN after that chapter is done, we get to the NEXT chapter, and are told what Langdon figured out.  I swear that exact same scenario happens at least a dozen times in the book.  Its just tiresome.      His villain is also very problematic.  Another religious nut who mutilates himself in some way, and seems to have super human powers in everything except of course in the ability to freaking kill Robert Langdon.  There is almost no difference between the tattooed monster in this book, and the albino monster in The DaVinci Code.   They both have flimsy, at best motivations, they both have back stories that are cartoon like.   They both are super strong, and super smart, to the point of being beyond human...and they both mutilate their bodes in some attempt to get closer to God.        This book has more in common with Browns very poor efforts like Deception Point, and a lot less with the fast paced fun of the other Langdon books.   This is a disappointing effort that I could never imagine reading again for any reason.  Too long, too poorly written with a plot that never makes any sense.
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|Maybe not like a fine wine getting better with age....but an old reliable friend that comes around every so often...AC/DC had been away for eight years and let the excitement build until last fall when `Black Ice' made its long awaited appearance.  I hate reviews that say...just as good as...or not as good as such a classic once in a lifetime record like `Back in Black' but I would like to say those days are long gone (almost 30 years ago??!!!!) yet they can still make very good, worthwhile records. The formula has been tried and true though `Black Ice' does have a few new wrinkles in more songs and the reappearance of slide guitar (\\"Stormy May Day\\") and even a ballad (\\"Rock n' Roll Dream\\") but for the most part the Youngs haven't veered all that far. A new collaborator noted veteran producer Brendan O'Brien (early Black Crowes) oversaw the band in Vancouver and while there is no indication in the song credits, supposedly Brian Johnson wrote the lyrics for the first time since the early `80's! Lead track and single \\"Rock n' Roll Train\\" is a huge song, classic Mutt Lange era chorus. \\"Big Jack\\", \\"Anything Goes\\" (very \\"Moneytalks-esque\\"), \\"Smash n' Grab\\", \\"Decibel\\", \\"She Likes Rock n'Roll\\" and \\"Skies on Fire\\" would be my favorite choice cuts from `Black Ice'.  Instant success and a major chain store tie-in to boot made `Black Ice' a best seller in the post-CD era.  AC/DC won't go away and who knows how long they'll keep producing their signature bone-crushing R&B...they are the REAL greatest rock band in the world.
B0025KVLS8|5.0|The sound is so good.  Of course the songs are the early Beatles and their simple formations of music inspired by their love rock and roll and love songs.  I listen to it while driving to and from work and it puts me in the right kind of mood.
0439023491|2.0|Catching Fire wasn't bad, but it could've been so much better. It was still a quick-read and I had a hard time putting it down mainly because the author puts a mini-cliffhanger at the end of every chapter so you just have to keep reading.<br /><br />However, too many things that had already happened in the first book were rehashed.<br /><br />1) Katniss and Peeta must return to the arena for another battle. This may have been exciting for some readers but we already read about it in the first book and not much changes this time around. We get the same description of the competitors getting dolled up, going to the practice, trying to wow the judges, etc. It's too repetitive. We read about all of this in the first book.<br />2) Although the arena is different, the battle is basically the same. It's not as exciting to watch Katniss fight or try to stay alive especially since we know she's going to survive (she's the MC isn't she?) so there was not a whole lot of suspense there.<br />3) The love triangle is still there and doesn't get resolved. In fact, Katniss has become somewhat whiny and annoying whereas in HG she was very assertive and strong. This is where the first-person narrative really fails, in my opinion. There's too much whining; not enough decision-making.<br /><br />My favorite scene was Peeta and Katniss finally getting to see Haymitch's Games and how he won. The ending was very abrupt and, of course, it's going to have readers begging for more. Basically, Catching Fire is a rehash of Hunger Games with a less satisfying ending.
B002GZQYMA|5.0|I absolutely love this new album by Muse, their consistency with their music is just amazing.
0545123267|4.0|but I didn't 100% love it. The writing was more than adept, but not blow-my-socks-off. The story was quite adequate but not compelling, can't-put-it-down-for-a-second fabulous. It's a pretty basic time-honored, girl meets \\"boy\\", timing's off, events conspire, worlds collide kind of story, and it has a satisfyingly \\"happy\\" ending, BUT. There are some kinda drastic leaps of faith and suspensions of disbelief required to make it all work.<br />An author has every right to create her own universe with its own conceits, constraints, and possibilities. But as a genius once told us  \\"with great power comes great responsibility\\", and Stiefvater fell a bit short of convincing me of her narrative's verity, beyond a shadow of a doubt, within her set bounds. Finally, while there was a charmingly poetic feel to some turns of phrase throughout, Sam's so-called lyrics actually made me want to gnaw off my own arm.
B002FOQXZK|2.0|I was really looking forward to hearing this album for quite some time, having heard a lot of hype and knowing that he has been endorsed by the legendary Kanye. However I hear nothing very innovative at all. His style is definitely pushing what people expect from Hip-Pop these days but Cudi just sounds like a less hip version of Dudley Perkins. If you haven't heard Dudley yet and you're a fan of Cudi you should definitely hit up Dudley, possibly one of the FONKIEST men of  the past couple decades.    I'll stay tuned for future releases by Cudi because things can only get better from this, there are definitely some good tracks on here but nothing really worth purchasing.
0385737947|5.0|This book was a surprisingly refreshing read. I loved how the action never seemed to stop. It almost felt like we were starting in the middle of a story which pecked my interest when I read the first page in the book store.<br /><br />Unlike many books I've read about dystopian societies, this one has a fresh twist about it that fascinates me. While Thomas is going through this you really feel like your being watched, you can literally taste, hear, smell, and fear what he does. I am thoroughly looking forward to the second book in this Trilogy.
B002K0WBXW|2.0|I like Sandra Bullock, but this movie didn't do much for me. It has some funny scenes, but overall isn't that funny. The who tyrannical boss - obsequious assistant dynamic just doesn't translate well into a love story. The fact that Bullock is an immigrant is almost forgotten. Unlike the excellent [[ASIN:B00008977F Green Card]], [[ASIN:B002K0WBXW The Proposal]] never really plays up any cultural differences because, well, Bullock's character is Canadian. This is a shame.    Overall, one is left with too many unbelievable gaps in the plot. For example, would Bullock and Reynolds really fall in love over one weekend? True love is fine, but they go from hating each other to marriage in 72 hours. Would Ryan Reynolds' dad really fly an immigration enforcement officer up to Alaska to investigate Sandra Bullock? Would her lawyer really recommend circumventing immigration law through a fake marriage (I'm a lawyer, and I know in real life a lawyer could get into a lot of trouble for that). One almost gets the sense that, with a bit more work and more storytelling, there is a decent movie here, but as it stands it seems sophomoric.    [[ASIN:B002K0WBXW The Proposal]] might be worth watching once if you like Bullock or Ryan Reynolds, but certainly isn't a keeper.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|From the very start to the very end this movie keeps you engrossed. It explains the beginning of Wolverine and lays the groundwork for the other stories that we have already seen in the X-Men series. Hugh Jackman does a great job portraying Logan who becomes \\"Wolverine\\".

0756655730|5.0|This is your typical coffee table book from DK Publishers.  Massive in size as well as scope, it covers everything from the beginnings of the planet until we settled down and started farming.  With breathtaking CG images as well as real pictures of fossils, \\"Prehistoric Life\\" will entrance younger members of the family, while its informative text and nicely-arranged narrative will give adults all the prehistory they can handle.  What you have here is a high-quality tome, printed on thick, glossy paper.  It gives the impression that you should have paid $100.00 or more for it.  Quite a value at the price offered here.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.

1565123875|4.0|I really liked this novel, the prose was well written and engaging. I found the choice of subject matter compelling and the diversity between two family members with very different views was illustrative of what occurs very often when colonial influences separate the traditional and exchange it for thier vision. We have a man that has so much unrest in the world that he puts up a false front in an effort to keep up appearances in the community and as a result he has managed to terrorize the people that are closest to him and need for him to be the most rational. He managed to push his father away, and had some contempt for his sisters, more because they would not really tow his line, yet instead chose to lead thier lives fruitfully. In the end as life was becoming more difficult, and the same issues continued to resurface, and his world was very small despite his contact with many, many people. It just came to an end as the people that he was supposed to protect and cherish were the people that were instrumental in changing his life.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|One of the best I have seen.  The seller rating is a 5 as well.  My order was processed quickly and I received the movie in only a few days.  Will use seller again.
0307454541|4.0|I found this book to be quite enjoyable, as it started out slow and there was really no indication as to which direction that it would take. As characters were added and explained, it took some very different and unique twists and turns, where several people that would have no business crossing paths and being friendly, became that way. The author very seldom would show his hand regarding who is coming next, who would do what next and how some issues and characters would come to fit together. In the second half of the book, it merely took off not unlike a runaway train and the reader is compelled to hang on and observe what new revelations are in store. This book was a great deal of fun.

0385504225|4.0|I've been waiting years for this book to come out. It was an entertaining read, but it was not worth the wait.<br /><br />Enough reviewers have summarized the plot, so I won't do that here. Suffice it to say, if you like Dan Brown and have enjoyed all of his novels - you will probably enjoy this one too. But if you're stuck on The Da Vinci Code and consider it his best work to be surpassed, you will be sorely disappointed. To give you an idea of where I stand on the issue, Deception Point is my favorite novel by Brown.<br /><br />The introduction of noetic science in this novel is very interesting, but the subject is treated very superficially and you get the sense that either the hard science wasn't there for him to elaborate on, or that he just got bored with it. He could have done so much more with it - I read hundreds of pages with bated breath to find out the exciting conclusions of these \\"universe-altering\\" experiments, only to be met with (*****spoiler alert****) the measured weight of the human soul.<br /><br />This novel does not contain the level of controversy to be had in DVC and Angels & Demons. It does not make you think the same way those novels do. I found this to be disappointing, and I think the gap of the noetic science was the reason I was left wanting in this aspect.<br /><br />If you like the temptation of looking up pieces of art and architecture mentioned in his novels, you will enjoy his references. Personally, I enjoy Brown as an author because of the amount of research he puts into each book. I am giving him the benefit of the doubt in assuming the research was the reason why it took to long to come with this book.<br /><br />All in all, I would say this book was entertaining but lacking \\"meat.\\" Langdon has also become an annoying character with his condescending, know-it-all \\"thoughts\\" written on every page. I agree with another reviewer that stated \\"the ending sucked.\\" But I was sucked into the journey the entire time, unable to put thebook down for extended periods of time. Take it lightly for what it is, don't get caught up in comparisons, and just allow yourself to be entertained.

B000FTWB7G|5.0|I just recently heard of Evanescence....(Yes I have been living under a rock!), but anyway I digress. I ordered \\"Fallen\\" a few weeks ago, enjoyed it so much I ordered this CD and got it yesterday. Listened to it 3 times so far, great CD. Overall not as rocking as \\"Fallen\\", but Amy Lee is still awesome!  I would have to say, \\"Good Enough\\" is my favorite song on this CD....Amy's beautiful voice brings tears to my eyes. I wish they were in concert somewhere!!!
0385504225|1.0|Far fetched, although not so much as Angels and Demons.  Don't get me wrong, I like fiction.  But this was just trying too hard, and pass off some points as confirmed fact (mana from heaven? really?). A lot of the chapters seem to be written as if for a made-for-tv movie.  1-2 pages long, and contributing little to any plot or character development.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|I have been a huge Mark Knopfler fan for many years and couldn't wait for this release.  I popped the CD in without looking at the inside jacket and heard the first track \\"Border  Reiver.\\"  I immediately felt a Celtic Connection here and thought I was listening to an old Silly Wizard record.  Lo and behold I see multi instrumentalist and co-founder of Silly WIzard, Phil Cunningham plays on 3 tracks of this CD.  This song made me want to jig all over my house.  The album goes in different musical directions but Knopfler once again puts together one dynamite of a record.  Piper to the End, Remembrance Day, and Before Gas and TV are a few of the standouts.  Knopfler's guitar playing is as strong as it was back in the Dire Straits days.  Can't wait for him to come to Southern California.
0812548094|4.0|There was an improvement in the writing skill for this book, as I'd hoped he's seemed to have gotten a few of his writing kinks out and it was more enjoyable and less aggravating than the first book. I enjoyed the plot and characters, and thankfully after about the 12th time he finally stopped referring to Richard as a 'Rare person' every three pages.    A few quirks still bother me, namely that he can't really get away from describing things certain ways. Kahlan's use of her powers are always described as 'thunder with no sound'. After the umpteenth time of reading that, alright already, I get what her power is like, you can shake it up a bit. Goodkind does this in other areas as well, but the strength and pace of his story makes up for it, and it was an enjoyable read all around. A solid 3 1/2 stars, I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series.

B001LB1I5S|3.0|The Arena di Verona is a spectacular venue seating an audience of 15,000 but its open air situation makes any musical ambience near impossible.  The orchestra is well recorded in DTS-HD audio but does sound flat because of this and the singers come through less intimately. The artistry is ok with Florenza Cedolins capturing a couple of nice moments in her role as Tosca but this traditional production is generally less than riveting. I feel there are better renditions of this opera to come on Blu Ray so this version cannot be enthusiastically recommended.

B002JTMNX2|3.0|Foreigner without Lou Gramm is a tough pill to swallow. The story now is out about the creative differences between Gramm and guitarist Mick Jones. With that said, Jones was and still is the architect of the band's sound. And former Hurricane vocalist Kelly Hansen makes the grade. Hansen sounds like a youthful Gramm. But some of the same fans who grew weary following \\"4\\" will also hear Jones' obsession with sounding adult contemporary yet again. \\"Can't Slow Down\\" leads off this collection as a promising slice of \\"Head Games\\" era sounding nostalgia. But then things begin to change. \\"In Pieces\\" is a mid-tempo repetitive AC sounding track that doesn't follow \\"Slow Down\\" very well. Next is \\"When It Comes To Love\\". A pure ballad that hearkens back to the \\"Agent Provacateur\\" era. A perfect fit for early '90's soft rock radio. \\"Living In A Dream\\" picks up the pace a bit, but lacks the grit and force of the lead off track. \\"I Can't Give Up\\" opens with a Beatlesque piano and a sparse lead vocal from Hansen. Jones still seems bent on getting on some radio stations with this stuff. The tracks are all instantly melodic and memorable. The problem is that fans of the first four albums will wonder why the band didn't truly do a retrofit of their earlier work. \\"Ready\\" is the next track that veers closer to the old stuff, but still misses. The guitar work doesn't have that identifiable edge that defined the band even on their off albums. \\"Give Me A Sign\\" is a pop tune with a hint of that classic sound that made this band famous. \\"I'll Be Home Tonight\\" is another song that is a bit too ordinary and slow for this collection. It's great formula though and it sounds like it could be a hit. It's just too mellow and doesn't really challenge Hansen at all vocally. \\"Too Late\\" is the song that made the last Foreigner \\"Best of\\" package and is a dead ringer for their classic era. It's a shame more of this album didn't live up to this standard. \\"Lonely\\" is another mushy kind of pop number that doesn't flush out enough guitar. The mix on this album is mostly a wall of sound whereas old Foreigner was more instrumentally identifiable. \\"As Long As I Live\\" is yet another ballad. A smooth song that has great hooks but doesn't contain the bite of anything classic. \\"Angel Tonight\\" almost gets back to the signature sound from the harder moments from the '80's. Not bad. \\"Fool For You Anyway\\" is a remake of a super excellent album track from the first Foreigner album. It's done in a laid back style that stays true to the original but could almost make it to Motown. All and all, this album is chocked full of melodic pop-rock minus the \\"Hot Blooded\\" sound and certainly nothing even close to \\"Dirty White Boy\\". Maybe this is just an aging rock band acting their age. This is not an effort even close to what Journey or AC/DC did on their way back from obscurity. The bonus here is 2 more discs worth of material including cleaner and more bottom end friendly versions of their classic hits and a concert DVD that shows that the live act may be better than their new studio work. Lou Gramm may have lost most of his vocal skills, but he can still rock. I\\"m not even sure if Kelly Hansen isn't wondering where the guitars went in the mix. This is a great set for value, but a mediocre attempt at a completely new Foreigner album.doesn't flush out enough guitar.

B0025X4P24|4.0|Vanessa Williams did it again!  She never puts out a bad CD and makes great song  choices and what a voice she has!  I highly recommend this CD.....you definitely can't go wrong with this one!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|The Lost Symbol is, for me, the worst of what I've read from Dan Brown so far...The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons, and Deception Point were all superior efforts.  The Lost Symbol seemed overly frantic, as if the story was forced to fit in the short time rather than naturally happening in that time span.  Additionally, I really got the feeling that he didn't know how to end it...many pages of what I suppose is 'denouement'...seemed to drag on and on.

B002K0WBXW|4.0|I loved this movie when I saw it for the first time in theaters a few months ago! There is never a part where you don't laugh from start to finish, and it also has a good moral as well. I wanted to see it, because the previews looked hilarious, and I am a big Sandra Bullock fan. She is just one of the top few actresses that are truly talented, funny ,sweet, and down to earth. She also has this certain glow and charm that you can't help, but love her. This movie definitely is a romantic comedy that is at top at its game with laughter and fun! If you love romantic comedies or Sandra Bullock, you will definitely enjoy this movie!
B002CAWNEM|3.0|Not as good as I exptected it to be but was just ok.  Kind of like Fatal Attraction only the acting wasn't half as good as the actors in that movie.  Kind of surprised this one even made it into the movie theaters and didn't go straight to video.
B0002IQMKM|5.0|First let me say that while I enjoy the music of the Talking Heads, I am not a rabid fan.  If I were, I'd probably say that \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilations are a poor substitute for owning every disc in their catalog.  Since I am not, I can say that this particular compilation is the most comprehensive I've found, including all of their most popular tracks (and a few less popular ones).  My 300-disc jukebox is full, with a \\"waiting list\\" of worthy entries.  This particular disc replaced an existing TH album, \\"Stop Making Sense.\\"  I loved that album, but there were other TH tunes I also liked from other discs.  I scoured Amazon's TH catalog for the one CD that included all of the tracks I enjoyed from SMS, as well as others, such as Road to Nowhere, And She Was, Once in a Lifetime, and Wild Wild Life.    So for all you purists out there, without the $$ or space for every TH disc, this is the next best thing.  Even if you already own the entire catalog, this is the one you'll play most often.

0061914177|5.0|Dear Lord...@garyvee is a powerhouse, a workhorse, and a Jet Fan.  Okay, so we got that.  We have seen him all over the world, talking the talk, walking the walk.  It is all right there on the unavoidable surface for Gary.  But, you know what, we have seen a ton of jackasses in short sleeves talking about personal brand, social media, and basically trying to pimp the system for what you want to sell.  And these idiots somehow think they can dress it up in other things, and it will be better.    The fact is that Gary and his book, like Gary and his company, and Gary and his blog, and Gary and his twitter stream, 100% transparent.  He manages to write a book that is clear, concise, focused, and manic in its delivery.  This comes from the fact that it is actually a dictated book, not written.    Gary talks about using your passion in ways that matter, in serving yourself...and how going big is never a bad thing.  That making the first million is never a bad thing.  Gary is this generations Russell Simmons, and I do not say that lightly since Russell Rush changed my life.    Gary is a life changer, a motivational superforce, and the best part, he is not telling you anything you do not already know or think you know.  It is all in you, and Gary knows it.  He just points it out.    I have bought ten copies of this book, and given all ten away.
B001493FK8|5.0|Let me start out by saying that it is my personal opinion that the works of J.R.R. Tolkien are the greatest works of imaginative fiction ever produced. I absolutely love getting lost in the ridiculously detailed world of Middle-Earth time and time again. No one can top Tolkien, or indeed even come close in my mind, in the world of fantasy writing.<br />  And then I purchased A Game of Thrones.<br />  Nothing will ever take The Lord of the Rings place in my heart. Ever. Tolkien single-handedly introduced such fantasy staples as elves, dwarves, goblins, etc. into the minds of future authors and videogame makers. He showed others the pinnacle of creating your own fictional universe.<br />  That being said, A Song of Ice and Fire tells a more interesting tale. The Lord of the Rings tells the classic epic journey, good versus evil, no gray area whatsoever. Not that there's anything wrong with that. In A Song of Ice and Fire, there is backstabbing, politics, incest, sex, murder, and just generally bad people. It's a much more realistic, if grim and slightly depressing, world. The characters in A Song of Ice and Fire are all flawed and frequently fail. It's a safe bet that if you love a character, they will end up dead/maimed/dishonored. The \\"good\\" guys don't always win, or even necesarilly do good things all the time. I seriously doubt whether there will be a completely happy ending to this series at all. And I'm ok with that. Mr. George R.R. Martin has done a fantastic job of taking Tolkien's blueprint of creating a fantasy universe, and dragging it kicking and screaming into the modern age of grimness and failure. You will care about the characters and what is going on, and I guarantee that if you like fantasy, you will be completely sucked in by this tale greedily devour the four books currently out and anxiously await the final three.<br />  In conclusion, these books are damn good. J.R.R. Tolkien created the fantasy genre, but George R.R. Martin perfected it.
0143037757|4.0|This is a fascinating book that I'm glad that I read but that I'm also glad is over.    Judt sets out to explain how Europe went from being a continent made up of many countries to, well, the European Union. His central thesis is that the utter devastation of the two World Wars left Europe so hobbled and its citizenry so shell-shocked that the only way progress could occur was with strong direction from the government. In the case of Western Europe, that meant the \\"Welfare State\\" served up in various forms in different countries, and in Eastern Europe it meant a degree of acceptance of the communist regimes put in place by Stalin. Judt ends with the Soviet Union gone, Eastern Europe clamoring to get into the EU and Western Europe struggling to figure out just what it means to be European.    That probably doesn't sound like a scintillating read. I won't lie. This is isn't a page turner over all but parts of it do have the sweep and drive of great popular history. Other parts read like a text book. Judt loves facts and figures. Given the choice between telling you that coal production in Belgium fell 45% in ten years or telling you exactly what coal production was in 1960 and 1970, he'll always go with the later. Still, I haven't come across any other book which attempts to do what Judt does and while he does have his opinions, he's far from doctrinaire. Judt isn't a fan of Maggie Thatcher, Francoise Mitterand or Boutros Boutros-Ghali - which is quite a gamut.    Judt takes on a few sacred cows as well, for instance he explains the events of Paris 1968 in a way that is less heroic and more about squatters' rights. He doesn't shy away from Europe's less appealing actions either - like enforced sterilization through until the mid-1970s. What emerges is a full picture of a continent trying to assembly itself into a community.    If you want to know how the shambles of postwar Europe became the Europe of today, this is the place to start. It's especially notable for it'sinsistence on seeing Europe independent of the United States and for giving equal time to the Eastern European experience. Recommended for those interested in 20th Century history.    Kindle Note: no photographs

B000BDLJBU|5.0|The 3.5mm plug on one of my favorite pair of Shure earbud headphones started failing about month after the product was out of warranty.  This angled plug was the perfect replacement for the broken plug.  Yes, there is stripping and soldering involved, and it may take you a few tries to get all three connections properly soldered.  It is especially difficult for someone like me who doesn't do a lot of soldering.  Also, my headphone cord was a bit too thick to fit in the plug's plastic grip, so I had to carve some indents into the plastic so that the plug could be screwed together.    But, the end result was a pair of salvaged headphones that work as good as they did when the original plug was working properly.  Exactly what I was looking for in a replacement angled plug.

B002MW50KO|5.0|Who would have thought? But who should be surprised when Bob Dylan gives us the unexpected? He has never been afraid of taking chances.  I've read some pre-release dialog between people who were speculating about Dylan's religious views - Is he really a Christian, a Jew or what? I don't know for sure. I suspect he is sort of both - if that's possible, and I'd say he is humble and sincere about it. But it would be hard to fit him - or for him to fit himself - into any strictly orthodox mold. And so with his music, and so we are better off for that here with Christmas in the Heart.   In short, I think this CD is a delight. To me it often has a sort of 1940s flavor; maybe if Louie Armstrong and Leon Redbone did a Christmas album with the Andrews Sisters it would be like this. It can vary from playful at one moment to touching at another.   Of course this is not Nat Cole or Perry Como, not your typical Christmas crooner. The voice is the gravelly Dylanesque some may not like. But I like it, as will many, I believe. You either get Dylan or you don't. And even some of his best fans at times want to grab him and suction the phlegm off his vocal cords - admittedly here more often than in other recent albums. Maybe he will do something about that.    This CD, though, is unique and sincere (no parody - Dylan does not mock religion). And with some fine music, vocal accompaniment (unlike anything you've heard before with Dylan) and the variety of selections, it's a pleasure to hear - and yes, good for a few laughs too. It changes tempo and tone to keep things moving and interesting. He also gives us some interesting twists in the lyrics.  I'm glad I bought it. I expect I'll be listening to it each Christmas season from now on. And it's for a good cause to boot. Can I get an \\"Amen\\"? - (you get a nice one as the CD's closing word.)  12/24/10 - WHETHER PRO OR CON, HAS ANY OTHER CHRISTMAS RECORD EVER GENERATED SO MANY REVIEWS AND COMMENTS?

0143036556|5.0|Years ago, Diamond wrote an essay on the origins of agriculture titled: The Worst Mistake In The History Of The Human Race.  In a nutshell, Diamond said: \\"Recent discoveries suggest that the adoption of agriculture, supposedly our most decisive step toward a better life, was in many ways a catastrophe from which we have never recovered.  With agriculture came the gross social and sexual inequality, the disease and despotism that curse our existence.\\"<br /><br />Collapse is not a critique of agriculture and civilization.  Collapse is a book that explores why some societies collapse, and others survive.  It takes a less radical stance, in an attempt to communicate with a more mainstream audience.  Hence, in this examination Iceland is rated as a success, because it has survived for 1,000 years -- despite the fact that its modern industrial-consumer mode of living is absolutely unsustainable.  Chevron is praised for being a tree-hugging oil company.  And so on.  Collapse gets a bit fishy in places, but overall it's solid and fair.<br /><br />Diamond is a geography professor at UCLA.  He has given many lectures on the Easter Island story.  His students always have a difficult time grasping the image of natives cutting down the last tree on the island.  \\"That's simply not possible -- people aren't that stupid!\\"<br /><br />Well, unfortunately, yes we are, is Diamond's conclusion in Collapse.  He shows us societies that collapsed because of problems that were known and correctable.  In order to survive, societies need to pay attention to the ecosystem around them, take problems seriously, respond to them intelligently, and -- very importantly -- don't let dysfunctional cultural values take you down.  Let go of obsolete beliefs before they destroy you.<br /><br />Ultimately, responsibility for society's survival is in the hands of individuals.  Diamond isn't an advocate for externalizing -- sitting around whining about naughty corporations and politicians.  When the people get uppity, and demand change, change happens.  This is one of history's most important and obvious messages.<br /><br />Diamond concludes the book with the obligatory pronouncement of hope for the future.  Yes, we are more aware than previous generations.  Yes, we have a tremendous number of opportunities for improvement.  Yes, we could really improve our prospects for the future, if we chose to pursue this.  Well, miraculous change is fine with me, and if it happens, I'll eat my cynicism.<br /><br />I liked the book.  It addresses an uncomfortable subject that has been taboo from polite conversation for far too long.  The clear message is that we should not feel safe and secure because we live in the most \\"advanced\\" society in human history, where legions of angelic experts are protecting us.  We are in danger, and big trouble is not too far away.  I agree.  But we are not without options.<br /><br />Richard Adrian Reese<br />Author of What Is Sustainablehappens.

B00005B36H|2.0|Some people are into this style, I personally am not. That is, songs that are not catchy, do not have very interesting melodies or arrangements or discernible parts (verse, chorus, bridge, etc). The songs on this album come across more as a jam session that Tool is meandering through. It just sort of goes on and on and there are few memorable moments. As I said, if you're into that, as it is clear that many people here are, then this may be your thing. I prefer the Tool on \\"Undertow\\" (Prison Sex and Sober both being standout tracks on that album).
B002BSHWUU|5.0|It only took 22 years but the powers that be finally re-mastered the Beatles collection. To paraphrase from the back cover of their first American Capital release: \\"Only a hermit could be unaware of the re-mastered Beatles CD collection, and he'd have to be beyond range of television, newspapers, radio, CD's, and rioting fans!\\"<br />I took my time and listened to each disc carefully. I'm not an extreme audiophile with thousands of dollars invested in stereo equipment, but I do have a very good system, one that can reproduce sound as accurately and probably better than is heard in most homes. I also have a mixer which makes A-B-ing that much easier.<br />First of all, there is no comparison to the original 1987 releases FOR THE MOST PART. I must admit, \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" sounds beefed up i.e. the sound quality of the newly re-mastered version is not that far off from the '87 version, only the newly re-mastered version sounds louder. In fact, Ringo's cymbals are mixed much lower, nearly drowned out, in the new re-mastered version of \\"Can't Buy Me Love.\\" This is the only song that I have noticed this. Then there is the awful cut-harmonica version of \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" - why, when the original 'Hard Day's Night' release had the song with no drop in the instrument, did they put this version on the CD? The '87 version had the correct one - why was this version used? Thank God I still have my '87 original as well as my high quality bootleg copy.<br />I also, by the way, A-B'd my Capital box sets of the early recordings and, I must say, to these ears the Capital releases are definitely on par with these newly re-mastered versions, which tells me that whoever re-mastered the Capital releases in the earlier part of this decade knew their stuff. Needless to say, I will not get rid of my Capital versions.<br />So, to summarize the earlier recordings: Definitely better (for the most part - stereo finally!) than the 1987 releases  but equal to the Capital releases (also in stereo) of a few years ago.<br />Onto the later Beatles: There is no comparison. Simple as that. Every song that I have heard just blows me away, especially the acoustic numbers such as \\"Across the Universe.\\" It sounds like John Lennon is sitting in my living room! The bottom that seemed to be missing on 'Sgt. Pepper' is now there, giving me an idea of what was heard during the original sessions. The fullness of \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" makes it like I'm listening to the tune for the first time - it's that good.<br />So, in my opinion the box set is worth getting because the sound as a whole is noticeably better than the 1987 releases, as well as getting the first four albums in stereo. It deservedly receives five stars (even with \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and the cut harmonica on \\"I Should Have Known Better\\") because the quality of the rest are so much better.<br />If you only have those originals from '87, I highly recommend this collection.<br /><br />(Addendum: I was corrected about the harmonica part in \\"I Should Have Known Better.\\" I was informed that the 'cut harmonica' was on the stereo version only.

B000F7CMRM|1.0|I found this movie in the $5 bargain box (along with a bunch of other movies I had never heard of) at Walmart. Sad to say, I wasted my money.    Writer and Director Stephen Gaghan tries to define himself for a new generation, but all that he delivers is an abortion of a motion picture.     The best scene was when the main character was being tortured; as the viewer, I could sympathize as I felt equally tortured watching this movie.    I actually laughed out loud during the extra features when George Clooney related how anxious his fellow stars were to get a part in the film (I wonder how they feel about it now).     If you want taut, intelligent drama, watch Spielberg's MUNICH instead of this force-fed globetrotting disaster - SYRIANA is one of the worst films I've ever seen.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|This is a great album!  Megadeth is back with a politically charged album that will get the smart \\"metalhead\\" thinking about where the country is heading.  \\"Endgame\\" and \\"This is how the Story Ends\\" are eery harbingers of where Dave Mustaine believes we may be heading.  It's also a great history lesson looking back at a dark day in U.S History with \\"44 Minutes.\\"
B002MW50KO|5.0|Well, I finally have a reason to believe in angels. Only cherubic, winged creatures from heaven could anoint what is perhaps the finest album of the year; nay, the millennium! Do you hear what I hear, indeed!<br /><br />I'm just kidding, of course.<br /><br />What I REALLY like about this Dylan album is you can't deny it. Like a Vulcan at a Flat Earth Society convention, you can't convince yourself it's real, as opposed to previous, more subtle \\"joke albums\\" -- like \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and \\"Nashville Skyline\\" with its muppet-yuppie dichotomy -- which, much like Soviet-made RPGs, failed to deliver their payload.<br /><br />\\"Christmas in the Heart\\" (which translates to \\"Christmas with Whitey\\" in English) is a big FU at WASPs and the whole \\"apple pie\\" crowd with their super size, bite-size, new and improved spending implants pulsing and staining their scalps. It's more tasteful than Andres Serrano peeing in a glass or Piero Manzoni crapping in a can, but just as anti-establishment. When Bobby D belches out the refrain on \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing,\\" triggering your one memory of Grandpappy Brick drunk at the kitchen table, swinging his stubbly potato head wildly, fists pumping the air as he howls TV jingles at top volume, you can feel Dylan's middle finger bristling your nape.<br /><br />It was an added bonus to find out that all these songs are Dylan originals. Wow!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I'm a die hard Star Trek fan, read the Pockets books and comics when I was a mere youth, and love to watch the movies even the bad ones (Final Frontier, lets pretend that never happened), enjoy all the tv spinoffs even the poor relation ST Enterprise. So was lookng forward to the movie and glad to say I loved it! If you are a fan that hates change then this movie is not for you and why should it be its now 2009 not 1969 and thankfully all the 1960's tv hangups of racism and sexism that Star Trek tho ground breaking sill suffered from, can be exorcised. This movie creates new canon so either get over it folks or get on board an enjoy!
B001RTP48G|1.0|Oh boy.  Where to start?  I have been a huge fan of PSB since 1996.  My first PSB CD was Very.  After that Bilingual.  Then I had to have everything they owned.  I spent days on Amazon, in record stores, on the web, finding every single, every CD and even vinyl.  I loved it all.  I was even worried when I heard about the mellow \\"Release\\". But I loved that one, too.  A lot.  So, I was counting days to get Yes!.  Well, I have tried and tried, but it's a big No!.  More like a no-no.  The trademarks of PSB are catchy melodies, clever lyrics and flawless arrangements.  I don't find any of that here.  I have to struggle to recall a single melody from this CD and I really hate some of the lyrics.  What's worse, it sounds like it's really only one very long song instead of 11 different ones.  And not even a good song.  Just a long, dull, irritating background for a low budget movie.  At this point two singles have been released.  I bought Love, etc.  I can't bring myself to listen to it again.  Then I heard Beautiful People was next.  This will be the first PSB single I don't buy. The melody is amateurish and the lyrics have been heard in so many ways so many times before.  I could go on about each track on the CD, but it means I would have to listen to them all again.  I just can't.  I hope the Pet Shop Boys revisit what went wrong here (too much reliance on non-PSB contributions).  They are a unique act and need to cultivate what makes them different.

B00005RDRO|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favorites, ever since years ago my younger sister and I came across it late one night on TV when we were in high school and watched it.  We both thought this bizarre, clever little movie was just awesome, and each time you watch it, you catch things you might not have caught the first time.
B000NJVWVO|5.0|I've been a fan of Corinne Bailey Rae for years now, ever since her original album was released in the states a few years ago. I'd never owned my own copy because my mother's copy was on my computer (and therefore on my iPod), so when I did decide to buy one for myself, I shelled out a few extra dollars to get the import 2-CD deluxe edition for all the bonus tracks. I'll do a quick review of both discs here:<br /><br />The initial album, the self-titled \\"Corinne Bailey Rae,\\" is a stupendous feat of both songwriting and originality. It's simple to call Rae a soul singer; the truth is she's infused soul and jazz and and pop and even a little funk to create a style all her own to match her singularly unique vocals. From the opening guitar strings of the sweetly innocent \\"Like a Star\\" through to the complex \\"Seasons Change,\\" there is not a song on the album that isn't a sultry, sweet joy to listen to.<br /><br />Rae was the lead songwriter on this effort and her strength in lyrics and prose shows through on the shimmeringly emotive tracks \\"Enchantment\\" and \\"Breathless,\\" as well as the uplifting fun of \\"Put Your Records On\\" and \\"I'd Like To.\\" The few slow ballads aren't at all gloomy; indeed, there's a relaxing quality to the entire tone of the album that's as soothing as it is uplifting; one could listen to it falling to sleep or during a summer block party and get the same experience.<br /><br />In the deluxe edition, we recieve an all-new second disc with ten all-new tracks. I'll start this off by saying that the second disc was a slight disappointment; the few new original songs by Rae weren't anywhere near as good as the stuff of the original album and one can immediately see why each track was left off of her debut. That's not to say that each one isn't immensely enjoyable, however.<br /><br />Rae gives us four new original tracks, and immediate standouts are the lovely electronic rhythms of \\"Emeraldine\\" and the soft strains \\"Since I've Been Loving You.\\" Fans of simple mixes will get a kick out of the alternate versions of \\"Enchantment [Amp Fiddler Remix]\\" and \\"I'd Like To [Weekender Remix].\\" Rae also covers Bjork's \\"Venus as a Boy\\" and Aretha Franklin's \\"Daydreaming\\" to great effect, paying credit to two of her many inspirations.<br /><br />Ultimately, the deluxe edition is a great addition to any large fan of Rae's library, but the initial debut album is all that's really needed. No matter which you choose for yourself, I can guarantee that the listening experience will be one of the most satisfying and original musical experiences that's come out these past few years. Now that Rae has stated that she will soon be releasing her second album, I can hardly wait!<br /><br />Five out of five stars.<br /><br />Also recommended: Joss Stone, Sam & Ruby, Ani DiFranco, Jack Johnsonf the alternate versions of \\"Enchantment [Amp Fiddler Remix]\\" and \\"I'd Like To [Weekender Remix].\\" Rae also covers Bjork's \\"Venus as a Boy\\" and Aretha Franklin's \\"Daydreaming\\" to great effect, paying credit to two of her many inspirations.

B001O12PCU|5.0|a good action sci-fi film for adults only because of the profanity.  this is not for children.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I was surprised, impressed and moved by this magnificent, albeit compressed, account of the lives of our most compelling founding father and mother. While Paul Giamatti, at first blush, did not seem the John Adams type, his generous, authentic performance was over the top. I admire the fact that screenwriters incorporated so much essential information in less than eight hours of running time, and that the drama never flagged for a moment.    I must say that this was Laura Linney's film. Her portrayal of Abigail exceeded all my expectations and reminded me how underutilized this splendid actress has been in the US. She brought her role to life with humor, pathos and innuendo. Her dialogues with Jefferson smoked. Her occasional rages at John, for all his absences, were wrenching. And the scene in which she watches her children receive innoculations for smallpox was deeply disturbing. In turn, her struggle to maintain emotional strength as Nabby struggled to survive the illness were unspeakably moving.    I could go on and on about the cameos and other principal performances, perhaps the most surprising of which was David Morse as Washington. I'll simply say the casting was dead-on.    When I saw Tom Hanks' Playtone logo, I expected quality. What I did not expect is that I would be moved to the marrow. JOHN ADAMS is a must-see for anyone who wants a sense of the human beings who won and secured our country. Even more, it establishes Abigail Adams' position as a founder more significant than half the signers of the Declaration.    A beautiful series which deserved all the accolades it received.
0061914177|1.0|Mr. Vaynerchuk's book offers the newbie internet entrepreneur the same advice the mortgage industry provided unqualified homeowners:  No money down.  No credit history required.  Income?  None needed.  The 'buy-in' is free.  And who doesn't like free money?  The truth is that Mr. Vaynerchuk assumed a high-profile position within an already successful family-owned company.  He has become a brand enabled by dozens of anonymous employees and equally anonymous viewers of his celebrated WLTV.    The business model celebrated in Crush It teaches entrepreneurs how to cash in on the millions of dollars still miraculously left in the pockets of middle-class consumers.  This is not a book for those concerned with marketing transparency or with social responsibility.  It is all about how we, too, might yet make a quick buck while all around us honest people drown.
1594488878|4.0|Obviously there's deep irony in posting a review of a new book by one of my favorite authors when one of the key elements of the book's plot is an adoring fan's online review of a new album...but oh well. I have to admit, I was a little leery when I cracked the spine of Hornby's latest novel. After setting the bar ridiculously high with his first two books, [[ASIN:1573226882 Fever Pitch]] and [[ASIN:1594481784 High Fidelity]], Hornby has continued on to produce a series of engaging, but not quite as brilliant successors. And it had to be said that his last adult novel, [[ASIN:1594481938 A Long Way Down]], was distinctly underwhelming. Fortunately, this new book represents a return to form, as well as being a work that speaks to an older (though probably not wiser) audience than his previous work.<br /><br />The mechanics of the story are relatively simple: Annie and Duncan are a cohabitating couple approaching 40 as they eke out moderate existences as a small museum director and  college instructor, respectively. They've been together for 15 years, and about the only thing keeping them together is inertia and the lack of prospects in the seaside cultural wasteland they live in (a fictional town on England's eastern coast, somewhere near Hull -- roughly the American equivalent of a small, tacky, Jersey shore town). Duncan is obsessed with an obscure American singer-songwriter from the '80s who inexplicably walked away from music one day, and spends a great deal of his time and energy running a website devoted to the mysterious Tucker Crowe. One day, a \\"new\\" Tucker Crowe album is released (it's actually the demos from a concept album beloved by his fans), and Duncan and Annie's differing reactions to it trigger a chain of events which brings the reclusive ex-musician into their lives in the flesh.<br /><br />Here, we have three main characters who are middle-aged (as Hornby himself is) in a story whose dominant theme is mortality and regret. The book revolves around the question of what to do when you suspect you might have wasted a good portion of your life. Yes, it's all about the good old-fashioned mid-life crisis, only here, the characters don't have any particular attachments that will prevent them from repositioning themselves. If this doesn't sound promising, don't worry, it's engaging, funny, and refuses to submit to expectations. As in all his books, Hornby is honest enough to make his characters face the consequences of their poor decisions, while remaining a compassionate enough writer to make them real, multidimensional people.<br /><br />Another of the main themes is parenthood, and I wonder whether I would have connected to this book as much ten years ago, before I had children of my own. Hornby --himself a father of three -- seems to be suggesting that while conventional redemption is not simple to come by, a more complex kind may be achieved through parenthood. It'll be interesting to see if there's a generation gap in reactions to the book. All that said, there's still plenty of pop culture geekery to revel in. For example, one minor subplot involves Annie stumbling into a Northern Soul night at a local club, allowing Hornby to write about that odd little British subculture (see books like Nightshift, [[ASIN:1843922088 Northern Soul]], and [[ASIN:1861054319 Too Darn Soulful]]). And as I mentioned before, it's quite funny -- full of sharp wit and laugh-out-loud lines which help to even out the tone.

1593082800|4.0|I was totally surprised that this book captured me. Originally published as a serial story in a weekly magazine - it would surely sell magazines!  The descriptions are sometimes too detailed as was the style of the time - and you'll want to skim through those parts.  However, the story is compelling, detailed, touching.  Great character development! The book is far better than the PBS movie.
0385504225|2.0|Alright. I just finished the book and it definitely wasn't worth all the hype nor the wait. It had it's moments but he seems to be trying too hard to keep the same \\"Langdon\\" formula going. I felt like he was adding extra historical information just to stretch it out in certain passages.    A little more than half way through, it started to become too predictable. It got my attention in certain areas but it got to be long winded at times. I read another review that said \\"it got to be too preachy\\". Couldn't agree more. Just tell the damn story!    It was a bit of a let down and the ending was one of the most anti-climatic I've ever read. Really.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|I thought five stars was an overstatement for a first effort, but that thought was dismissed during the first play.  On the the second listen, the hooks set deep.  Now multiple plays have followed and then there was the live show at the Intersection in Grand Rapids, MI.  Look for them, this band is great live!  They've put together a collection of tunes that get into your head and heart in a wonderful way.  Creative explorations of light hearted music that makes you just... feel good about life.  A great high ranging lead vocalist,  diversely delightful instrumentation and harmony vocals that evoke the classics of pop rock.  Be Calm, is a favorite;  All the Pretty Girls, is pure fun; Light a Roman Candle with Me, will take you right to the sweet heart of summer love; The Gambler, moves wistfully deeper into love of your life territory; and I Wanna Be the One, beautifully lilts, soars and touches all the right places.  Discover Fun for yourself and then share this treat with someone special.
B001GIQNJM|4.0|This is a very good book and gives an interesting view of life abroad in Italy, India, and Indonesia.  Elizabeth goes to these three countries in that order and there she finds balance and gets to know herself much more personally.

B001QOOCTE|4.0|I saw the video on our local PBS station and decided to get a copy.  The video is extremely moving and has tracks not on the CD.  Several of the CD tracks are great, while some are just so-so.  However, on the whole a very nice CD/DVD combo and a worthy cause!
0553801473|3.0|I didn't think A DANCE WITH DRAGONS was as bad as the 1-star reviews suggest but at the same time I think I'd be hard put to argue with any of them. The book is highly unsatisfying after a 6-year wait, which itself followed a promise (or \\"devout hope\\") that the book would be published shortly (as in the following year) after A FEAST FOR CROWS, which itself was about setup, only for an almost entirely different set of characters. So any dangling plot threads from that book continue to dangle a the conclusion of ADWD. As for the dangling threads in ADWD, it's intriguing stuff, I admit, but when do we get to see them resolved? Who can say?<br /><br />Is the next book, THE WINDS OF WINTER, even a priority? I have my doubts.Consider the following taken from a post from Martin's blog:<br /><br />***Here's the stuff I am dealing with right now:<br />-- reviewing pitch proposals and putting together the overplot for the new Wild Cards mosaic novel, LOWBALL,<br />-- writing the first draft of my script for episode nine of season two of the HBO series GAME OF THRONES, \\"Blackwater,\\" and damn, but this one is a bitch of an adaptation, the original author made the damn battle way too big and too expensive,<br />-- working on a Nicholas van Rijn story for the Poul Anderson tribute anthology Gardner Dozois and Greg Bear are editing (an especially noisy monkey, since the deadline was today and the story is a long way from being done),<br />-- getting back into THE WORLD OF ICE AND FIRE, the long-promised concordance I am doing with Elio and Linda, which is almost three years late at this point, and needs to be finished and delivered by year's end,<br />-- roughing out the next Dunk and Egg novella, the next story in the queue after I finished the \\"Blackwater\\" script and the Poul Anderson story,<br />-- planning for a long summer of travel: the visit to Poland and Slovenia, the book tour, San Diego comicon, worldcon in Reno, Bubonicon, and maybe another trip overseas in the fall forthe HBO show, depending,<br />-- working on a complete redesign of my website, much needed and long postponed,<br />-- supervising and reviewing and approving materials for the games, the cards, the video games, the comic books, the replica swords, the miniatures, etc, etc.<br /><br />I am exhausted just typing about it.<br /><br />And behind all that, of course, lurks Son of Kong: the WINDS OF WINTER. ***<br /><br />Lurking BEHIND IT ALL is the WINDS OF WINTER. How can the author's most popular work be lurking behind it all? How can video games and websites take precedence over SONG OF ICE AND FIRE? I hope I'm wrong but I've also read somewhere that Martin doesn't intend to resume writing the next book until January. Might not all of this extracurricular stuff have been the reason for the long wait for ADWD? I couldn't say for sure, but I suspect that is the case. Is Martin's heart in it as much as seemed to be with the first three books? Not for me to say, but the list of things to do certainly is troubling.<br /><br />Anyway, I wanted to give this book 2 stars, but I am still interested in the story and reading its resolution (some day). I also thought the epilogue salvaged the book significantly, especially after the weak final chapter (Dany). So I'm giving it a grudging 3 stars instead.
0385504225|2.0|I bought this highly anticipated book returning Robert Langdon back on the scene of unsolved mysteries in famous places.      The book starts out well enough, but as it progresses, most of the scenarios are so odd and don't do the characters justice.    The book follows the usual formula. Langdon, friend of Langdon, a girl and the odd destructive character, all focused on a symbol that will give power to the world. That is all fine.  But after the middle of the book, Langdon starts to ramble about the mysteries of the Masonic order and how they relate to the building of Washington DC. These signs and symbols in relation to the capital, have been disproven already, many times.    Katherine, the woman compatriot of Langdon, thinks her lab assistant is in the lab when it is blown up. Her only comment afterwards is a gosh, I hope she made it out. Never anywhere as the book continues, does she lament the loss of her good friend. I find that rather shallow for Katherine who does everything with such passion.    Peter, Katherine's brother, has his hand cut off and yet later in the book when he is found, he takes Langdon on a trip to Washington Monument, as casually as if he has a cut finger. And when Katherine finds Langdon after this tour, Robert Langdon says that Peter went to the hospital, as if losing a hand was an everyday occurrence.    I think that Brown was pushing it this time to tell the story. Rambling dialogue, somewhat of a put down of the Masons, and shallow conversation, don't make for a great book.    I am glad that I read it so that I don't waste my time on any more of his books. He should have stopped with the Da Vinci code.

B002MTTZ5I|2.0|This could've been great.  Take the made up backstory, the scarcasm and the parody and keep it.  But don't put it in the songs themselves.  If they played the songs straight, but leaned on the made up image to lend them some credibility, they would've had something.    As it is, they're a foul mouth Weird Al Yankovick.    Hysterical at times, but not worth a purchase or even a second listen.
B001DPC4S2|5.0|It's been a long time since I owned MOONDANCE. There has been some debate on which is Van Morrisons best album. Come on. This is it.<br /><br />I just got the new print on vinyl and it is hella nice. Opening right off with its smooth, somewhat surreal but innocent AND IT STONED ME. We used to cover that bit at the Yardrock back in the day. Every song is just as good as the one it's next to on this album,,, theres no \\"this ones brilliant,\\" or \\"he's such a genius,\\" on this one folks. Just ten solid tracks that bring it home. And nothing can match the singability... CARAVAN, INTO THE MYSTIC, GREETINGS FROM NEW YORK... even CRAZY LOVE... eventually they will all win you over.<br /><br />Only plan on buying one VAN MORRISON album?

0061649694|4.0|This is a book that begs to be read aloud. I read it once and now I can't wait to read it to my little cousins. Neil Gaiman creates an alternate world in which Coraline is wanted by her \\"other mother\\". She must somehow figure out a way to get back into the real world with her real parents. She has the help of what she thought was a boring stone and also, the black cat. It was very interesting to see how Coraline gets out of the alternate world, and how she gets her parents back. And even after all this, how she takes care of her \\"other mother\\" for good. Even though this is a YA book and I'm 26, I was still a little scared while reading the story :)<br />This book is very creative and I can see why Gaiman is such a popular author. This was the 3rd book I've read by him and I can't wait to read more.

0316017922|4.0|The author posits that extraordinary achievers are not the result of just high intelligence and hard work, but the result of those who have seized additional \\"hidden\\" advantages.  These advantages include their cultural background, when and where they were born, and the demographics at the time.  Gladwell has an entertaining style of writing, as those familiar with his other works can attest.  He uses many anecdotes to illustrate his points.  Some interesting insights include:<br /><br />- the relationship between IQ and success only works up to a point.  Once someone has crossed the threshold of being \\"smart enough,\\" then additional IQ points don't translate into more success<br />- how cultural legacies explain the disasters of Avianca flight 052 and Korean Air flight 801<br />- how Western communication is transmitter oriented while many Eastern ones are receiver oriented<br />- how the Asian culture of hard work (from working in rice paddies) translates into better math scores<br /><br />Those who like Gladwell's other books will not be disappointed.

0385504225|1.0|It's not even worth wasting time typing a review explaining how bad this book is. I've never been a Dan Brown fan as his writing is mediocre at best, but Lost Symbol makes even mediocre sound good.  Stupid storyline, overblown writing style and an insipid quality very few books manage to achieve. All I can say is thank God I didn't buy this book as it was a gift, or I would have felt cheated to have wasted money on such a piece of garbage.

With the CD's I just pop one in while in the car and even if it does not have my complete attention I feel I am still getting what I need to hear.  I listen to it over and over without being bored with it.  As with all of us, I am still evolving and still learning.
0385504225|1.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's books except Deception Point, which I still have on the shelf. I thought his first book, The Digital Fortress, was among the worst books I have ever read. The Da Vinci was among the best I have ever read and Angels and Demons (except for the stupid ending) was only slightly less so. But The Lost Symbol regressed to a new low. Discounting some of the flaws I found in the plot itself, the book is at least 50 pages too long. The interminable passages dealing with brain power research and alternative interpretations in the bible and other religeous books simply overpowered the overall plot to the point that I had to literally struggle to complete the book. I think this will be my last Dan Brown book and I am inclined to leave Deception Point on the shelf unread.

I tried many different types of headsets before purchasing the P21 and nothing came close to the quality of sound, especially for chat clarity.

All in all I give these a 5 STAR rating
B00004RJ74|5.0|If you're sick of all this Twilight phenomenon that's still occurring as of today, and are looking for different and far more bad@** vampires, then you've made the right decision by finding the movie From Dusk Till Dawn here on Amazon. In this film, we not only see vampires and blood, but also some awesome action and some very dark humor. The first half of the film is basically an action adventure with George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino. The second half is where the bigger mayhem is found: vampires, guns, gore, explosions, etc. And it all happens in a strip club: can it get any stranger than that? Everyone does an extraordinary job here: Clooney and Tarantino as the main protagonist; Keitel, Lewis, and Liu as supporting characters; Hayek as the sexy Satanico Pandemonium; Marin as comic relief; the direction, the music, the editing, the cinematography, everything is done with flair and verve. So forget Twilight and its \\"sparkly\\" vampires that only teenage girls will love; From Dusk Till Dawn is a real treat if you're into REAL awesome vampires.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I absolutely love this DVD, and recommend it to anyone that asks about my wourout plans.  I didn't expect the results that I saw from such a short workout, so I was very pleasantly surprised.  I'm a busy mom, so I love the fact that it's only 25 minutes.  Jillian keeps things no-nonsense with basic moves (think jumping jacks and push ups).  Not only are there 3 levels of difficulty to choose from, there are beginner and advanced options in each level that will help cater to all levels of fitness.  Personally, I've only made it to Level 2, but in those 2 weeks, I saw significant loss of inches, especially from my waist.  If you need peppy music or dancey moves to keep you motivated, this won't cut it, but if you need a tough workout with fast results, get this DVD.

0553213105|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.<br /><br />And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...<br /><br />Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).<br /><br />The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.<br /><br />But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").<br /><br />It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

It suffers a little from a lack of Holmes, but is otherwise a tightly-written, solid little mystery.<br /><br />Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead of a heart attack -- apparently killed by a family curse in the shape of a giant dog. So his pal Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to protect Charles' heir, Henry Baskerville, who has just arrived in England to claim his estate and inheritance.<br /><br />But even without Holmes, Watson can tell that something is up -- secretive servants, peculiar neighbors, an escaped criminal, a giant quicksand marsh, and the sounds of a dog howling in the night. But Holmes knows that the curse is no supernatural hound -- and that Sir Henry is in danger from a more real kind of ancient enemy.<br /><br />\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" stumbles in one area -- the relative lack of Holmes. He's out of the picture for most of the book, and Watson does plenty of solid detecting on his own. Everybody loves the faithful narrator, but Watson isn't the Great Detective, and the book feels vaguely incomplete without Holmes inspecting clues and giving little hints to Watson.<br /><br />The mystery unfolds at a languid pace, dropping a few red herrings along the way. Doyle pays loving attention to the dangerous, almost surreal Grimpen Mire and the surrounding countryside. But when Holmes comes back onto the scene, the book tightens itself up. All the plot threads rapidly slip into place as the real \\"hound\\" is uncovered.<br /><br />Holmes' steel-trap mind is untarnished here, especially when he reveals what he figured out at the end. He's especially likable in an endearing scene at the beginning, where he educates Watson on deduction. But this is Watson's turn to shine, since he spends a long time gathering clues and even solving a sub-mystery without any assistance.<br /><br />\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a short, satisfying Holmesian mystery, which is only hampered by Holmes' absence for about half the book.

1563899426|4.0|Imagine if all the legendary story characters were living secretly in New York -- and they weren't quite fairy tale material?<br /><br />In short, Prince Charming is a thrice-divorced lech, the Big Bad Wolf is now a werewolf cop, Snow White is an embittered government manager, and some very peculiar other residents crashing in a modern city. \\"Fables Volume 1: Legends in Exile\\" does an excellent job smoothly introducing the world of Bill Willingham's series, even as he spins up a pretty solid little murder mystery.<br /><br />The daily business of the hard-nosed Snow White (a Fable government official whom everyone comes to with complaints) is interrupted when Bigby Wolf brings her some ghastly news: her estranged, wild-child sister Rose Red has been murdered, and there's no sign of her except for buckets of blood all over her apartment. The most obvious suspect is Jack, whom Snow White helps interrogate when she isn't dealing with her womanizing, impoverished aristocrat ex, Prince Charming.<br /><br />But some of the details about Rose Red's death don't add up -- and as Bigby investigates further into the people who knew her well, he begins finding aspects of her life hidden from everybody. Not to mention an irate fiancee who wants revenge on Jack. As the Remembrance Day approaches, Bigby puts together the clues to a very bizarre case where not everything is what it seems -- and not everyone is doing what they claim.<br /><br />Bill Willingham is an expert in taking beloved characters from legends, fairy tales and nursery rhymes... and then turning our perceptions of them on their heads (example: Beast and Beauty's marital troubles cause his curse to reassert itself). He's also created a pretty unique fantasy concept -- the Fables and their magic have been driven out of their fantastical homeland, and live as secret refugees in the middle of New York City. It's actually a pretty cool idea.<br /><br />If it were nothing but a \\"cool idea\\" gimmick, \\"Fables\\" might be a fun read but not a great one. However, Willingham has a knack for weaving together action-packed, gritty plots with a touch of sex, plenty of splattered gore, and plenty of quirky twists (Pinocchio is angry about being a \\"real boy\\" who never grows up). And even as he carefully introduces the characters and their situations, he also spins up a solid murder mystery that intertwines with the other subplots like ivy vines on a stone wall -- splatters of blood, a padlock, a strange betrothal contract, and a missing body all take part.<br /><br />And Willingham's cast is as large as the number of beloved free-domain characters allows... well, at least the well-known ones. The inhabitants of fairy tales and folk legends loom especially large in the story -- the hard-nosed, no-nonsense Snow White; the bickering Beauty and her Beast hubby; the flirtatious much-married Prince Charming (who spends much of the story seducing waitresses and selling unusable property); the grizzled cop Bigby Wolf; supposedly reformed serial killer Bluebeard; a rather embittered Cinderella, and so on. Despite the vast cast of characters, Willingham juggles them adeptly and gives each character a distinct personality.<br /><br />Bill Willingham started off the Fables series on a strong footing with \\"Fables Vol. 1: Legends in Exile,\\" which combines a quirky fantasy concept with a solid murder mystery.

061891868X|3.0|This book came out at around the same time as Woit's \\"not even wrong,\\" which is on a similar topic. Both contain decent descriptive histories of what string theory is, and where it went pear-shaped. Both books explain the sociological and 'economic' forces in building up a large community of very smart people which doesn't work properly. Both also miss out on one important thing I thought was pretty obvious. What all quantum gravity people (Smolin and his crew of merry misfits included with the string theorists) are doing is entirely aesthetically driven. There is no reason gravity should have a quantum theory any more than a ham sandwich should have a quantum theory associated with it. There are no experimental, or even observational reasons to presume gravity has a quantum limit. It's all aesthetics. They're nice aesthetics, but science has no real business doing aesthetics. The image Smolin paints of his italian colleague waving a knife around at the idea that the universe might not live up to his aesthetic ideals is supposed to be funny, but it is exactly what is wrong. Science is all about learning about how the universe works, not seeking aesthetic answers to questions that the universe isn't asking. The search for quantum gravity itself is nothing but an aesthetic wish.<br /><br />In his first chapter he defines what he claims are the five great outstanding problems in physics today. I must respectfully disagree with all but  his second one. The four I disagree with are essentially cosmological questions; the questions string theory (and Smolin and Rovelli's rival idea of \\"loop quantum gravity\\") ultimately attempt to answer. Quantum gravity may, as people like Freeman Dyson think, be a silly question. Gravity may no more have a quantum limit than steam engines and other grossly macroscopic objects do. Assuming gravity does have a quantum limit may be the great folly of theoretical physics of the last 50 years. His outstanding problems numbers three and four, I count as essentially the same: come up with a unified field theory that predicts fundamental constants observed in nature. Why should things work this way, besides the fact that it would make Lee and his pals happy? These ideas are, to my mind, problematic for the same reasons the idea of quantum gravity itself is problematic. While many people do indeed think the universe should have some sort of ultimate theory which can unify the particles and forces, and predict why the fine structure constant is what it is, the reasons people think so are historical and aesthetic. Aesthetically, physicists like only having to remember a few things, rather than many things. Historically, the unification of magnetism, electricity and light into one theory really was a tremendous breakthrough in human knowledge. 50 years later, all manner of practical uses were found for it. Let us compare this to the most successful unification of modern times, the electro-weak theory (a unification of a force governing certain kinds of nuclear decay with that of electromagnetism). Unlike Maxwell's equations, electroweak theory is abysmally ugly. Unfortunately for aesthetics, it does appear the universe works this way. The benign god who wrote Maxwell's equations must have contracted electroweak theory out to some perverse lesser daemon, like Loki. Comparing practical implications 50 years from the creation of electroweak theory: there have been none. I'll go out on a safe, fat limb and assert there will be none, ever; at least if we continue to think of that area as \\"done\\" somehow and pretty much ignore it. As for the many outstanding problems in astronomical cosmology which Smolin collects together as the fifth major outstanding problem in physics; I find it hard to get too worked up about them, as the astronomers seem to find new \\"anomolies\\" every time they fire up a new telescope. Sure, it is interesting and worth thinking about, and it is nice to have someone telling the telescope boys what to look for, but there are more frightening lacunae in physics which should be on the table. The fundamentals of quantum mechanics, mesoscopic physics, the second law of thermodynamics, self-organization and emergent properties in matter; these appear to me much more pressing issues than trying to stick the square peg of gravity in the round hole of quantum mechanics.<br /><br /> I have this idea that physics, along with Western civilization in general, never fully escaped from the wandervogel era \\"playing indian in the woods\\" navel gazing of post WW-1 Europe. In fact, I think as a result, physics attracts moosh-headed (though intelligent) people who think this sort of \\"looking into the mind of god\\" thinking is, well, acceptable, when it really shouldn't be for a serious scientist. Or any kind of serious person outside of religious or metaphysical study. In the Victorian era which spawned the ideas of Maxwell and (early) Einstein, a theoretical physicist's job was to come up with models that fit the experimental data; a physicist was a sort of mathematical phenomenologist. He was not an aesthetician.  An interesting observation which might be made is how physics followed many other formerly rigorous fields in to the badlands of 'theory.' String theory is to Victorian physics what modern Literary theory or artistic technique is to their Victorian analogs. Certainly, the modern thing can be said to be more 'sophisticated' -but it is also more useless for understanding the world. Postmodernism? Intellectual laziness brought on by declining standards? The corrosive effects of professionalization and bureaucratization of the academy? This is something I wish people would address, and quickly, but it will probably fall to future historians of science.<br /><br />Smolin is a friend of several of my friends, so it pains me to have to say bad things about him, but his idea that more affirmative action is going to help physics is laughably insane. I'd go so far as to say this is probably a symptom of the type of mental illness which thinks doing quantum gravity is important because it must be so, aesthetically. Physicists did better before they were required by their Universities to engage in ritual Maoist witch hunts against racism and sexism. That's an obvious historical fact. Whether or not these things are actually meaningfully correlated: doing the opposite of what our forefathers did isn't going to get us anywhere. I mean, he's on the right track: you should try to hire people who think differently from what everyone else is doing. How exactly are you going to institutionalize this? Poor Einstein couldn't get a university job in 1904 -so if Universities were that moronic then, we haven't a hope of getting this right now.<br /><br />The real solution to this problem is a lot more radical and frightening to people who work within the University-Industry axis of mediocrity. It's also positively heretical to people who worship education as some kind of secular sacrament. To my mind, the strength of the institution you belong to is the weakness of the individual. The very idea of a University is medieval and feudalistic, or at best Industrial. You want to do real original research? Quit academia and become a free lance consultant. It's what I have done, and freed of the bureaucratic need to churn out nonsense papers, or spend my time baking vacuum chambers, my creativity has blossomed. I'll never be an eminence grise like Smolin in any subject, as I'm not as clever as he is, but I will likely die richer, and have enjoyed my life more than chaining myself to some horrific bureaucracy whose purpose is to crush all original thought.

He then proceeds to demonstrate how businesses need to adopt and work within the social media platforms in order to build or maintain successful brands and reputations, as well as actually make sales and move products.  He shows how in the social media age (of which we are at the beginning) that customer information and feedback is instantaneous, and businesses need to react and adapt accordingly in order to build relationships with their customers.

It's fast paced, with plenty of adventure, suspense, and mystery, with a dash of horror, and just a pinch of romance for good measure. The plot will definitely keep you guessing right until the end.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the main character is a bit of a Mary Sue (or Marty Stu, in this case, since it's a male). He's the new guy, yet he's got everything going for him, including \\"a familiar feeling\\" about everything, and what's more--he solves the big puzzle in a day or two, when a whole roomful of geniuses couldn't figure it out after two years? Yeah, I don't think so. But if you can get past that, it's well worth reading. I look forward to the sequels.

If you have read Maggie's other work - Lament or Ballad, you are probably aware of her talent for intertwining poetry and lyrics into her work - this book is no exception. One of the main characters, Sam, is constantly expressing his thoughts in lyrics that will make you wish you had the music they were meant for.     When I first picked up this book I was expecting yet another entertaining but all too common werewolf story, but I was happily surprised after just a few pages. Maggie is great at giving her characters depth while drawing you into the story and she is just as good at describing the most intimate moments between the characters. One of my favorite aspects of this book is that it switches between the first-person narration of both main characters with neither character stealing the show and both painting an incredibly vivid picture of their relationship.    This book is probably better appreciated by young girls, but I wouldn't shy away from it if I were a guy. There is a slightly emo feel to the story and how it is told - and I mean that in a good way!

0385751893|5.0|The story of a family schismed by the Nazi regime's doings, the dynamics are not always subtle, but they serve the story. The worth of the film's watching is primarily to be found in the young boys and girl navigating this landscape, and the landscape itself. Some truths not very often seen in films are shown, and some may resist praising the story as it shows compassion for families torn apart from within by the political dynamics of the day, as well as the reality of willful or natural blindness. These are all worth exploring sans posturing and correctitude.    I will not deeply critique nor criticize the storylines, the plausibility, etc. I turned to the film with no expectations, only the hope of not being manipulated overly, or of being bored by predictability.    Method acting sticks out all over in this piece. Impressive. As a young soldier screams into the little boy's face, and shouts with rage at a ragged old man shuffling about, I find myself flinching. I'm not a pushover: I switch off fast if it's not True enough.  The storyline causes one to finally understand how it is that, truly, there WERE children, and the childish, who really were slow to understand... the film succeeds in obviating the adult view much of the time, as we Get It, the view of the 8 year old boy. The changes his sister go through work well to highlight the developmental mindset of this child of the war.    The most impressive performance, in my heart, is that of little Schmuel. It is not in the size nor breadth of his part. It is in the precise hole in the universe that is this child.     Searching online, I find only shots of the dark-haired star child, or of the father, the blond leftenant... I do not see any real pictures of Schmuel. Why is this? He exists in my mind for days now, and seems to have been the most powerful character[ization] in an altogether excellent, well-crafted, beautifully designed and shot film.

I tore through it in less than 48 hours, and overall there was entertainment and enjoyment in the process of the reading, but overall I felt like it wasn't as worthwhile as when I read The Davinci Code, or even Angels & Demons (both of which I have reviewed here on Amazon).    I think what bothered me most was that the main villian's identity was easily discerned, so when the reveal occurred there was no 'Aha' moment for me.  The final conclusion was also a bit of a bore in my opinion.  I am sure once the script writers in Hollywood get their hands on this they will make it more thrilling than the overall experience of the reading was.  Until then, if you are a fan of the Robert Langdon character go ahead and give it a go.  After all, reading a book is better than doing nothing at all.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|I am 50 years old and just watched this film for the first time. I loved it.  I thought Eddie Murphy and Mike Meyers were the original multi-character creators. I was wrong, Peter Sellers showed them how to do it.  The film is serious and funny all at the same time. It deals with a very intense  subject with over the top humor thrown in. Watch it, you will not be disapointed.
0765356147|4.0|My son got this as a Birthday present. He reads a lot of fantasy novels, and says that they sometimes become formulaic and predictable. He LOVED this series though, and was really impressed with this book. He couldn't recommend it any higher :)

B00000HZTB|5.0|In short - this is Lou Reed's greatest album.    'Transformer', 'Berlin' and 'Street Hassle' may get the most press, but 'The Blue Mask' is the real deal.    Yes, that's a steep claim; but after listening to Lou's output over the years, 'The Blue Mask' holds up like none other.  It's an absolutely beautiful, moving and soulful album.  Lou is at his most mature, honest and vulnerable.  He's also brutal, as this album contains two of Lou's most devastating songs - \\"Waves of Fear\\" and \\"The Blue Mask\\".  And man, what a doozy that title track is - we're talking psychopathic, desperate and intensely powerful!  (Like a lost GG Allen tune that GG could never competently express.)    I've owned different versions of The Blue Mask, and the 2006 BMG Japan Mini LP remaster is the best (although pricey).  The expanded sound quality finally do justice to the intricate, almost avant-garde guitar play between Lou and Robert Quine.  Their harsh, angular riffs rock like the greatest Sonic Youth material.    Beleive the hype - The Blue Mask is the definition of a consistent, rewarding album.  A true comeback album.  One of the greats.
0788864157|5.0|The DVD of the OLD Walt Disney classic DUMBO arrived very quickly and in better shape than I expected....my granddaughter just loves it.  Excellent experience; highly reccomend this seller.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I ordered this CD for my son for his 8th birthday and he absolutely loves it.  He has already downloaded all the songs on his iPod.  It really is essential as it has every song you could possible want to hear.  As a 40+ woman who grew up along with MJ and his music, I am loving it as well.  I highly recommend it.  My only regret is that the lyrics are not included.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I highly recommend this DVD/Bluray Combo Pack!  It's absolutely amazing to see this old classic in almost too good to be digitally remastered form.  Not only is the movie excellent but the extras on the discs give you soooo much more to do.  I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!
0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown's main character from his previous two books, Robert Langdon, gets involved this time with the Masons in Washington, DC.      Dan Brown and his publisher are laughing all the way to the bank, with an initial release of 5 million copies, though I rate this book at barely 3 stars. (Sure more stars equals a \\"helpful review\\") but I'm being responsible with this review to prospective readers. As a follow-on novel to Angels & Demons, and The Da Vinci Code, this book disappointed me.    On the positive side, it's fast moving with all 505 pages taking place over a single day/night as is typical fashion for the author.  It gives the reader a private look into some details of DC that most of us would never have known, much less will ever see.    However, the plot is formulaic, somewhat predictable, and simplistic.  It almost reads like he was thinking of writing a movie script, and less so a novel that we really care about.  Moreover, his writing style, while intended for the masses of readers he will have, is shallow, simple, and just very basic.  Nothing really thought provoking.  But if that does'nt matter to you, then at least you now know.    This book just didnt capture me, and though parts are interesting, I was glad to finish it.  For those of you that decide to read it anyway, my suggetion is to not expect anything better or even equal to his two previous books - in fact less so - and if you can do that, then maybe you wont be as disappointed as I was.
0385121679|5.0|The Shining is a fantastically written book that is much better than the movie. Everything seems to be a symbol, and the use of color is very interesting. There are a lot of mysteries to figure out which makes reading it fun. I definately reccommend it to people who have seen the movie and enjoyed it, but the book I think you would like more.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|fade away was a perfect intro into the cd. i was a little disappointed that there wasn't as many hard songs as some of their previous cds. some of the songs wont sound as good live as they do on cd but that's a given. i definitely enjoyed the softer songs' timing and composition. i will not bow will probably be in whole bunches of soundtracks. i would say that the benjamin boys should stay away from the mystic songs that are simple and uplifting. much of their positive energy dissipated throughout the first two cds (as it would with any other legendary vocalist/lyricist). getting into more melancholy acoustics with a rich full sound along with excellent pick-ups to a strong chorus while maintaining a brazen, metal core is what they know and excel at. a must have for the benjamin fan.
1846143047|2.0|One would think that a book of fashion images would be equally weighted between  pictures of men and women.  But this book has about 70% images of men, which (being a woman)   I wish I would have known before buying this book.  It is now offically a doorstop.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|The Diamond Edition of Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is truly magical and a must have.  It comes with both a  DVD and Blu-Ray in the same package and it is a 3 disc combo.  The clarity of the color and the high definition audio makes the movie seem like it was made today not decades ago and then restored... Disney has truly outdone themselves, you can tell they took their time and spared nothing.      There are so many extras that it will take quite a while to navigate through it all.  There is Disney Family Play, backstage Disney and classic bonus like Dopey's wild Mine Ride games, Heigh-Ho karaoke sing along and more.  The video itself is 84 minutes and come with English, Spanish and French audio and subtitles.    Rediscovering this classic with my family was a memorable experience and I cant say enough about this masterpiece!
B00005R2IS|4.0|For more than 20 years, American audiences were saddled with an inferior version of the 1979 action-thriller from Down Under. A  worldwide hit upon its initial release, director George Miller's \\"Mad Max\\" had the misfortune of receiving U.S. distribution from American-International Pictures (AIP), which trimmed five minutes and redubbed the film with American voices - thus eliminating its Australian flavor. Adding insult to injury, AIP buried the movie in drive-ins and grindhouses as a second feature. Happily, the original 95-minute version can be found on this DVD release. Fueled by Mel Gibson's effective performance as a vengeful highway cop and David Eggby's stunning photography, the futuristic \\"Mad Max\\"  boasts some extraordinary stunt work and offbeat characterizations.  Miller gains tremendous mileage from his limited budget and the Australian locations provide an ideal visual counterpart to the desolate cops-vs.-bikers atmosphere. Not surprisingly, this independent cult classic helped put Australia on the cinematic map.

The movie is still a wonder, but it is not high definition.  It loses some of its pizazz because it is standard definition.  I enjoyed it, but wish I had waited to see if it makes it to Blu-ray.

B002K9C0Q6|5.0|Let's start weighing this performance by considering twinges of anticipatory misgiving..      No doubt the invention of modern recording arts and sciences has helped Bruckner, quite a bit.  Pioneering, world-class readings could go where no local band went, and even where many big name prestige bands did not yet go.  We benefit.  This brings us to sound.  Both standard red book PCM and super audio surround techniques have captured a number of these impressive Bruckner ninths.  Among any reasonable red book disc option, the sound is hardly ever a detriment.  Otto Klemperer (EMI, remastered), Giulini, Gunter Wand - these are all released in excellent regular PCM sound.  Then, in super audio surround - we have a Japanese SACD remaster of Gunter Wand with Berlin, Nezet-Seguin with OMGM, Harnoncourt with Vienna, and Marek Janowski with Ansermet's band, L'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.  My highest regards for super audio readings have until now included Gunter Wand in Berlin, and Fabio Luisi in Dresden.      This new SONY BMG Red Seal release is a second installment in what looks to be a complete Bruckner symphony cycle in progress, Paavo Jaarvi leading the Frankfurt Radio.  I liked the first disc, a paced and thrilling reading of the seventh symphony; but I wondered if the players could maintain such high commitment, faced with the valedictory and monumental ninth.    Yet, to my ears so far, this second Bruckner reading keeps up with the first disc.  Perhaps exceeds it, insofar as the mysterious and mystical ninth exceeds the seventh as a sample of the composer's vision?    Big bands with rich sound are apt for super audio surround recording. In this second SACD, a sense of presence is typically increased by the back channels, even if nobody actively moves the orchestra into all the channels simultaneously.  Again, our venue gets a chance to contribute.  Yes, again these engineers know just what they are doing.  Again, the venue, Alte Oper Frankfurt, comes across both warm and brilliant.  Kudos to the HR engineers, as this disc is a co-production with Hessian Radio?  Thus, this second reading captures a notable sonic mix of glow and clarity, just as the first release did.    Thanks to Jarvi and the HRSO players - the strings have sheen, warm polish, and an unusually disciplined strength of phrasing, altogether.  The last time I heard string sections phrasing so purposefully I was listening to the Jaarvi-Frankfurt Radio Bruckner seventh.      If you got to know Bruckner via the old, traditional recordings - you will probably just eat up this one, too.  Jarvi adopts entirely solid, mainstream tempos - and makes much of very carefully pulsed and finessed playing, all along the way.  He can maintain a very long arch of superbly graded musical tensions - just like the best of Carl Schuricht, Karl Bohm, Otto Klemperer, and other Bruckner conductors of fond memory.  If Jarvi just went all soggy and sporadic, swooshing and slogging from juicy phrase to juicy phrase?  Then super audio would expose him mercilessly.  As it is, the high resolution sound dramatically show cases the conductor and the players, revealing art plus art beyond art.  The great third movement Adagio reaches as high in gestures of contemplation and eternity as any reading so far available.  The whole symphony is marked with precious gleaming metals, born in fire.    The second movement scherzo is not diminished in eerie, impish, dissonant intervals, all wisp and ectoplasm.  Tempo takes wing.  Yet these players still sound very light, inflected, motion and impetus preparing us somehow for our eventual opening onto the timelessness vista of the final movement chorale yet to come.  An omnipresent brilliance in the strings helps etch the musical line, even when the band is going soft, ppp.  The rhythms are caught just right.  Deft touches of lift and lilt rubato, in and out and through.  Hardly has the oscillation between oddness in woodwinds or strings and steel girder mass in the full band, been more forcefully mastered.  The more relaxed trios have plenty of charm, no doubt; those woodwinds whirl and chirrup in passing warm jest.  Yet all still sounds like a harbinger of musical vastness - tonal strength, color, rhythm - all primal elements in a musical periodic chart waiting to gather and drive forward again when the scherzo moment returns.    The opening Finale beggars actual description.  The tempo is basic, familiar.  That big, striding brass theme rings out, dwarfing all human enterprises.  The massed orchestra is cosmic in tonal sheen and gathered musical weight - recalling that old master Carl Schuricht in Vienna.  Hardly have the opening massed string motifs moved with such fit muscularity.  The climbing chromatic harmonies ascend, relentless, sure-footed.           Vigor and intensity - all playing towards a musical end point, still out of reach - describe the rest of this last movement.  The lyrical contrasts relax seamlessly into the brass chorale emerging, played off against the faster finale themes and tempos.  The conductor's marvelous handling of musical tension is simply immense in sweep and finesse as he controls all the small and large gestures.  Just as most listeners will wish, the close is transcendental.    Those utterly committed to nothing but completely traditional Bruckner readings may quibble with this one. Jarvi and HRSO bring enough of a modernist clarity to the music that we are quite a musical distance from, say, Celibidache in Munich in the autumn of his career.  If you are old school, you will take very great pleasure in Fabio Luisi in Dresden, or Gunter Wand in Berlin.  If you do not mind drive and clarity in your Bruckner, recalling what dear old George Szell could bring off in the glorious Cleveland Orchestra years, you may well find that this new reading portends a very grand approach to Bruckner that simply has no need at all, for even the merest touch of Silent Screen Cinema emoting.    I'm adding this one to the top lists.  I'm surprised.  I've found Paavo Jarvi to be uneven in past spins of his new releases; and I've grown to feel tilted a little against him, just because I never quite know just what sort of music-making I will find.  The chemistry on display here, between conductor and band, seems remarkably alert and capable.  HRSO has already done a complete Bruckner cycle, under Eliahu Inbal.  An arching of long musical structures, drive, mostly just missing by a few hairs from that earlier Frankfurt set.  So, just looking at the cast, I wondered if Bruckner from Jarvi with HRSO would more or less be Inbal redux.  Rest assured, we avoid all Ho-hum and Limp Bizkit in this second release in the series.    Jarvi beats the super audio competition, too, except for maybe (to me) the Japanese SACD remasters of Gunter Wand in Berlin, plus the Fabio Luisi reading from Dresden.  I'm keeping Janowksi for Schubertian contrast, too.  Those discs will probably always be super audio surround treasures.  Now Jaarvi in Frankfurt makes my list.  If everybody keeps this sort of playing up through all the remaining symphonies, this cycle will tower over a good many others of marked merit.    Five stars - reading, sound, Bruckner cycle installment, disc number two.  Five stars, no doubts.
B001KMB6X2|4.0|The Sci-Fi adventure epic is that venue in which the improbable and the inexplicable stay, thrashing in their own matrix of danger.  Here, DIESEL is up to speed and a little beyond, at last, with this one.  That spooky-scary kinetic rush of physical power and rage-aholism that animated XXX, PITCH BLACK and RIDDICK is back again, after a spate of gaffs and dung nuggets, and we can see the man as the MovieStar he is, for what he is, in his element.  What is that element?  It's that unpredictable area of semi-consciousness, part dream and part myth, where primal forces collide under the direction of men like David Twohy -- who orchestrated RIDDIK -- and Luc Besson, who directed, wrote and produced THE FIFTH ELEMENT.  And in many ways BABYLON AD closely resembles that movie, FIFTH ELEMENT.  Actually, the character Toorop of BABYLON AD is interchangeable with Korben Dallas of ELEMENT, played by Bruce Willis.  In their careers, both actors play archetypes and for the past five or more years, have been and are to a degree rivals, and except that they are not physical twins, their roles have been nearly identical:  SIN CITY, yet another rescue mission.  And so, this snippet from the blurb for FIFTH ELEMENT fits very well here:  This cast of actors stars \\"In an outrageous sci-fi adventure, an extravagantly styled tale of good against evil set in an unbelievable twenty-third century world.\\"    Both these actors, WILLIS and DIESEL have transcended their national origins, and even their original stereotypes (sarcastic West Side of Manhattan toughies) as well as their ethnic and racial origins, and become Types.  What types?  Brutes.  Or, just Americans as Europeans may well see us; mindless, mercenary Thugs.  Remember, if you check the very lengthy walk-out credits, you'll find that this movie is not an American movie, but a pan-European or International one, with credits for artistic and financial production coming from virtually every financial center in the world, an with artistic creation originating in Paris, Prague, Rome, London and only incidentally from New York.  In fact, considering Michelle Yeoh's considerable contribution, it wouldn't be strange if the Chinese film business contributed to BABYLON.    But what's BABYLON A.D. like to watch?  Luscious, to my way of thinking; irrational, wonderful, unnpredictable action and virtually all the actors give surprising performances.    DIESEL?  He looks great.  They've finally figured out how to vary his 'look' so that he's at least plausibly attractive in a street-like way.  (A MAN APART, a fairly good action flick, puts him in Mexi-Latino LA, and with facial hair he fits in.)  Here, they find  ways to make him look interesting on camera.  They do exquisite creative work with his tatooing; great forearm motifs, good hand stuff; they bring lines and slashes up to his hairline and do suave things with his scalp and rug.  So fine!  In a scene near the end of the movie he's caught in the shower first, with bleeding wounds and a spectacular all-over Egyptian-style dorsal tatoo and next, with Melanie Thierry in her undies.  They don't wrestle, but they don't have to.  Total Venus and Mars.  Arousing, like something out of DUN.     MELANIE THIERRY is a ravishing girl/woman with blonde hair and the face of an angel or, yes, yes, admit it; the face of the Madonna.  Like Milla Jovovich, she has the huge, pale wide eyes and Finnish-like not-quite androgynous body and the sense of unearthliness the role calls for.  Through most of the flick her role is passive: She appears to be psychotic, but turns out to be psychic, we find, en route.  However, she's always being pushed and pulled everywhere, by nearly everybody, so its hard to tell.  But somehow she maintains an unearthly poise that is both upsetting and attractive.    MICHELE YEOH brings to the film those qualities which, if you haven't ever seen her (in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON) or anything else, must remain inexplicable.  Grace, poise, beauty, strength and athleticism.  She is a marvel.  Chen-yu.    GERARD DEPARDIEU was a complete surprise.  I didn't look at the credits on the box and didn't realize that the character I saw, the Russian thug who set the story in motion, was indeed himself.  He is so great, but we seldom if ever see him in English-language movies.    And get ready for CHARLOTTE RAMPLING.  What a monster!  Almost didn't recognize her, haven't seen her for so long.  This beautiful bit will certainly bring her back more often.    The sets?  Peculiar.  Very, very interesting.      The premise is far beyond improbable; it is astonishing. Toorop, our hero, this out-at-the elbow post Bush-Oil II American mercenary is living somewhere in (Post-apocalyptic) Russia (of all places; no explanation) as a Russian and on very damned little, but gets an offer for work from one of the big Official Mafiosi.  He is not in a position to refuse, if only because his acceptance means the possibility that he may be able to escape to the USA and return to his family home.  It's a pick-up and delivery gig; some kind of wierd girl.  The trip?  From Russia, which looks like a scrap yard of barely operational military junk, to possibly Mongolia and an isolated monestary to fetch the girl who will not travel without her own special nun; then by partly-armored vintage 70s Zil, under and over the Silk Road, and then partly by rail to Vladivostak.  There, to pick up boat tickets, they wait at the edge of the fozen-over harbor.  Did you hear me?  It's a trip across frigging Asia, man!      Meanwhile, at the Vladivostak terminal there's a horrific bomb blast -- which thanks to the girl they avoid -- and a confusing series of fights and brawls with swarming, dangerous American kids like Juvie orphans, in and through a kind of rickety scaffolding that is almost but not quite architecture.  The incoherence is intense, and when the sub appears in the frozen harbor like a black, iron whale, and the fugitives swarm, that dreadful scene is handled with cruel, Soviet-like efficiency.    After more submarine experiences and near-lethal adventures crossing the Alaskan/Candian wastes, they find themselves in New York City. (Now, pop. 21 million:  it's Dekerd's cityscape from BLADERUNNER, seen from above.  Kosher Tokyo.)  There, in Haarlem, the story takes an abrupt twist, and the insane religious fanatics who paid for the delivery of the girl, prepare to receive her.  (It's The murderous Queen of the Night from THE MAGIC FLUTE and her nasty entourage.)  After promptly murdering her mate, she brings with her unending psychotic malice coupled with unspeakable violence.  There is an explosive  convulsion in which nearly everyone dies.    But not everybody.  Our anti-hero is resurrected or transformed into a loving, partly-bionic man, or fusion-droid, in up-state New York.  And from there...  It's short but home sweet home.    BABYLON A.D. is about as pure a HEAVY METAL adventure as you can find these days, and I intend to watch it again this afternoon.  (Envy me, you pathetic corporate deeves!)
B002MW50KO|5.0|When I first heard about Dylan's Christmas project, I must admit I thought it was a joke. First of all, Christmas In the Heart is not a new Bob Dylan CD. It`s a charity project.    Dylan has loosened up over the last few years: He has finally stopped fighting his own legend. He recent records exposes humor, irony and is more playful than ever. It`s like he is thinking that life isn`t that serious after all. Dylan`s inspiration from traditional blues, jazz and music hall songs from the 1920 to 1950 is obvious. It`s manifested on \\"Love & Theft\\" from 2001 and is also the inspiration for \\"Modern Times\\" and is also recognizable on his more bluesy 2009 effort \\"Together through life\\".    Dylan's Christmas album is in an odd way inspired from the same tradition. It gives me a kind of Dylan meets Disney, Sinatra and Andrew Sisters feeling. Dylan has simply made a Christmas record true to a musical heritage from the forties and fifties. His voice gives a new and sometimes unexpected feeling. If Santa has a voice, Dylan is probably the closest we ever get to hear it.  It's strange, but I feel Dylan's genius comes true and all of the songs on the record grow on me.    As a Dylan fan I think \\"Christmas Blues\\" and \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" is the highlights of the album. \\"Must be Santa\\" is probably the only polka and the most up-tempo song Dylan ever has recorded. It`s great fun and is also expected to be the soundtrack for the video from the album. However the quality of this record is so high, that I am not able to spot one weak song, if you buy the idea and intention with this project.    Many Dylan fans will claim that this is the worst Dylan record ever. I disagree. I think it is a hilariously funny record, based on good musical craftsmanship. Some of the songs express a kind of enjoyable madness. It works in a mysteriously way. I believe \\"Christmas In the Heart\\" will find it's natural place in many people's Christmas tradition, also among Dylan fans after thefirst shock.    This album is not a new Dylan record. It is a very funny and entertaining Christmas album from Mr. Dylan. He has made a classical Christmas album - in some way or another. This is probably the most interesting Christmas record ever released and Dylan has put a lot of effort and energy in doing this right. I love \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" and I tend to define it as a Dylan holyday masterpiece. It`s that good!
B001GCUO16|1.0|Second Blu-ray DVD that I've had technical problems with.  Not sure if mass production quality control is up to standards.  First problem was audio, this X-Men Origins is simply non-functional.  It does not download or play.
B002BSHXJA|4.0|These mono remasters are possibly more exciting and noteworthy than their stereo younger brothers. Although the new stereo albums have hugely benefited from a scrub with the sonic toothbrush, they were at least in catalogue before, apart from the first four albums and a few odds and ends, whereas the Beatles British album output from HELP! onwards has never been released in mono on CD before.<br /><br />These days, the most humble portable radio/CD player comes equipped with stereo speakers, and iPods and MP3 players all support stereo playback. A few world music and reggae albums may be released in mono these days, but by and large stereo has become the standard, with mono relegated to legacy releases, the audio equivalent of black and white. In the re-issue field, however, mono remains surprisingly resilient. Motown, for example, were early exponents of multi-track recording and released albums in stereo from the early sixties, yet compilations continue to favour the mono mixes of much of this material, and there are many advocates who stoutly prefer the punchier single-source mono sound, designed to be heard over the radio, invariably mono in those days.<br /><br />The purpose of these remasters is to get the best possible results from the existing master by repairing physical damage and bad edits, adding low-end frequencies, removing amplifier hum, clicks, pops and sibilance; but not compromising the musical performance in any way. It does not involve any remixing. The remastering was done using 192 kHz/24-bit technology, paving the way for DVD-A/SACD/HDCD releases, but the current box set is in standard resolution CD format.<br /><br />The market for this expensive box set was severely underestimated, with a limited run of 10,000 copies having sold out purely on pre-orders, and a second run having been exhausted within a month or so. At present, the mono albums are only available in this lavish package, with beautiful replica sleeves and artwork, but given its popularity, when the limited run is exhausted, I would be surprised if they were not subsequently made available separately in standard jewel-case editions, as I believe they should. A strong special case could be made for the first two albums, recorded on two-track equipment and only released in split-channel binaural audio on the stereo CDs.<br /><br />It was thought that the mono mixes would appeal only to the fanatical moptopophiles, and so unlike the stereo masters, there has been no limiting applied to these mono tracks, and even the length of the gaps between the tracks is the same as on the vinyl albums. They should not be compared to the American Capitol label releases as these were often remixed with superficially exciting added reverb. Furthermore, several of the American mono albums were simply fold-downs of the stereo albums, rather than the original mono as prepared by George Martin and the band themselves (the stereo mixes were usually created later and in a much shorter time, without any of the Beatles being involved).<br /><br />Whereas the stereo box set includes some mono tracks, where no stereo mix is available, the mono box set is exclusively mono. The only exception to this is the inclusion of the original 1965 stereo mixes of HELP! and Rubber Soul. These have added to the mono albums as a way of making these historical artifacts available, as later mixes have been used elsewhere.<br /><br />The difference between the mono and stereo formats of later albums such as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and The Beatles (The White Album) are notable, ranging from speed variations to alternative overdubbing, editing and playing times. Stereo was becoming more established by this time, but the mixing was still done quite separately, so there are marked anomalies between the two, with the mono mixes favoured by many aficionados.<br /><br />Yellow Submarine is not included in this box set because the mono release was simply a fold-down reduction of the stereo mix. By the time of Abbey Road and Let It Be, stereo cartridges had been introduced that could support mono record players, so the record companies no longer needed to release separate mono albums, a huge cost-saving that put an end to hours of fun comparing versions.<br /><br />Consequently, these two albums are also not included in the mono box. However, they were both released in mono in some overseas markets, and in the UK in open-reel tape format. I have read that these were also fold-downs, but I am not sure about this as Lewisohn's The Complete Beatles Chronicle reports the preparation of mono mixes at the Abbey Road studios. If they do exist, this would have been the perfect vehicle for their release.<br /><br />Finally, in this marathon box, comes the 2CD Mono Masters, collecting all the various singles, EPs, B-sides and stray tracks not to be found on their regular albums, a most diverse collection of tracks, from their earliest EMI recording to be released, the red-label single version of Love Me Do with Ringo on drums, to the jocular backroom surrealism of You Know My Name (Look Up The Number), originally destined for Yellow Submarine.<br /><br />Although largely based on the previously-released Past Masters, this is a new compilation. The Ballad Of John And Yoko, Old Brown Shoe and Let It Be were on stereo singles, never released in mono, and so dropped from Mono Masters. In their place come five tracks that were prepared for an EP of the new Beatles tracks from the film Yellow Submarine, but the EP never saw the light of the day.

Get Back and Don't Let Me Down differ slightly from both the stereo single versions and the Spector remixes.<br /><br />Whether we prefer the mono or stereo versions is really academic. Both are part of our heritage and should be permanently available.stereo cartridges had been introduced that could support mono record players, so the record companies no longer needed to release separate mono albums, a huge cost-saving that put an end to hours of fun comparing versions.    Consequently, these two albums are also not included in the mono box. However, they were both released in mono in some overseas markets, and in the UK in open-reel tape format. I have read that these were also fold-downs, but I am not sure about this as Lewisohn's The Complete Beatles Chronicle reports the preparation of mono mixes at the Abbey Road studios. If they do exist, this would have been the perfect vehicle for their release.    Finally, in this marathon box, comes the 2CD Mono Masters, collecting all the various singles, EPs, B-sides and stray tracks not to be found on their regular albums, a most diverse collection of tracks, from their earliest EMI recording to be released, the red-label single version of Love Me Do with Ringo on drums, to the jocular backroom surrealism of You Know My Name (Look Up The Number), originally destined for Yellow Submarine.     Although largely based on the previously-released Past Masters, this is a new compilation. The Ballad Of John And Yoko, Old Brown Shoe and Let It Be were on stereo singles, never released in mono, and so dropped from Mono Masters. In their place come five tracks that were prepared for an EP of the new Beatles tracks from the film Yellow Submarine, but the EP never saw the light of the day.

There is a wealth of Bible help information, even articles on ethics and theology which help to understand the application of the Bible.  The electronic resources that come with the Bible are worth the purchase price all on their own.  One of the best purchases I have ever made.  [[ASIN:1433502410 The ESV Study Bible]]
0385504225|5.0|I am shocked by the low reviews of The Lost Symbol.  I've read all of Dan Brown's books and The Lost Symbol ranks right next to The DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons.  Everything presented in this book is highly plausible, if not true.  I love the quick, easy-to-read chapters - nearly all of which end in cliffhangers!  The twist at the end was completely unexpected and I really enjoyed the turn it took.<br /><br />I believe a lot of people who have strong religious convictions will have trouble reading this book with an open mind.  Perhaps the most startling assertion is that man is created in God's image, not physically but in the mind.  The secret of the Masons lies in the Bible, Koran, Torah, etc. and that they tell two stories: one that most common men can understand, and another one that only truly enlightened men can understand.  For example, it tells of the story of manna falling from heaven.  The common man would take this to mean that some type of bread or nourishing food fell from the skies, however the enlightened man understands that manna is in fact a waxlike substance secreted by the brain when in a meditative trance that nourishes the body and that the brain/mind is actually where heaven is.<br /><br />If you like fast-paced and mysterious books about secret societies and solving codes, I highly recommend The Lost Symbol.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I remember watching \\"Snow White\\" as a child and I was so excited that it was now on Blu-Ray and DVD so I could share it with my children. The movie was GREAT!! My younger children(ages 6 and 3) loved it and watched it over and over again. I would definitely recommend this movie. It's a great family night movie :)
0385504225|4.0|This book is definitely one of Brown's best, although I liked Deception Point more.  Highly recommended if you liked his previous books.
0385341008|5.0|Once you get past the first few pages and get comfortable with the way this book is written, you will be completely wrapped up in this story. You will fall in love with the characters in the book.<br />The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is one of those \\"ahhh that was wonderful\\" kind of books

0385504225|4.0|Admiral David Farragaut, when invading Mobile Bay during the Civil War said, \\"Damn the Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead\\"  In his most recent book, \\"South of Broad, Pat Conroy has one of the characters say, \\"When I see a critic, I call pest control...\\"    Both comments would be appropriate for the reviews this book has received. Take your pick of the above quotes, but, and this is most important, read the book. It's good.  As Farragaut might say, \\"damn good.\\"    Many if not most reviews of \\"The Lost Symbol\\" have been less than sterling. The New York Times review was especially, small, back-biting and vitrolic. It read almost as if the critic--and who ever built a monumnet to a critic--was jealous of Dan Brown, the acclaim he has received and the money he has made.  To say that he has sold-out to the Masons and is only interested in money says more about the critic that the book.    This is a good book, a page turner, lots of history and interesting fact woven together with an action packed fast moving story.  It won't receive the reaction the Da Vinci Code received, but this is a good book, a worhty followup to the Code.    Yet, and this was interesting, the book's biggest surprise--the villan's identity and the reason for his villanry--was almost readily evident about halfway through.  If not readily evident, then relatively easy to figure out.  That's unusual for a Dan Brown book, but it matters not. How Brown gets to the end, the symbols he reveals and the story he tells is enrapturing, moving and unforgettable. The reader will never look at Washington D.C. the same way again.    Don't miss this book--don't let the critics dissuade you--don't miss anything with Dan Brown's name on it as author.      We are fortunate to live and read in the time of Dan Brown, Vince Flynn,Nelson DeMille and Brewster Milton Robertson.
031606792X|4.0|**CONTAINS SPOILERS**    One word for this series, enchanting.      I will admit that as a 24 year old, I had avoided this phenomenon for quite some time thinking it was purely for tweens. I finally got around to seeing the movie on DVD and instantly fell in love. I immediately downloaded the entire soundtrack, marched my way to Borders and bought the first book, Twilight.  I literally couldn't put it down and decided to return the book to buy the complete hardback collector's series box in its place. I can honestly admit that I was captivated by the tiny town of Forks and all the characters in it.  I fell head over heels in love with Edward and Bella's story.  All I could think about was the world of Edward and Bella and I had to keep reminding myself that they were not real people and that none of these stories could actually happen.  As pathetic as that sounds, I have never been quite affected by a book/series/saga as I was with the Stephanie Meyer's. I laughed, I cried, I was brought back to a place where anything could happen and dreams do come true and people can be perfect for each other. So that in and of itself was nice.    After finishing the first three books, I just couldn't wait to start the next installment. Like many of the reviewers here, I too had heard mixed reviews on Breaking Dawn, but I simply could not end this adventure not knowing how they would all end up. My expectations were high and I must say, my only disappointment was that I knew it was all coming to an end.     This final book was enjoyable for the most part. Like other readers, I have a few minor issues:        1.) By this point, I was pretty much ready to give my first born child to somehow be dating Edward or be switching places with Bella (which is extremely pathetic, I know). Moving past this, I realized that the only reason I was so captivated by this book was the incredibly intense, yet somehow teen appropriate, romance between the two main characters.  I was so ready for themto finally be together (married, honeymoon, etc. without Jacob) and then it was like a cruel joke for someone to hit me over the head and knock me unconscious for all the good parts. Not that I needed intense details because I know the author's target audience, but really? I mean, I get to hear about feathers and headboard breaking romance and not see any of it? That was a slight disappointment.        2.) Then Bella gets pregnant... Now I don't care about the difficult/unique name that was given to the baby, nor do I particularly care about the imprinting issue with Jacob (although that slightly ruined my image of him), but after this moment, it was like I didn't know Bella or Edward at all.  It was as if the same characters that I fell in love with throughout the first 3 books had disappeared and were replaced with total strangers. I don't care how whiny some readers think Bella is or how annoying it is to read about how wonderful and beautiful Edward is, these two were absolutely captivating characters and I was extremely disappointed when they left. I blamed Renesmee for their disappearance and lost any hope of growing attached to her character. Thus, the rest of 'their' story was pretty much tainted with the emphasis on the child. And the whole Rosalie thing actually ticked me off. Alice was a friend from the beginning and she was neglected in my opinion.        3.) Finally, the last portion of the book that focused on the fight that would never happen was a bit of a let down. Not that I wanted a fight to the death type of battle, but if it was all going to end with peaceful talks, it could have skipped a lot of the dialogue and back stories and reconnected the reader to Edward and Bella (and now Renesmee's) story. I only wish there was more of that.       While I am not hugely into magic or make believe, I do feel that the first three books were more realistic than this last one. Yes, it sounds dumb even trying to explain how vampires and werewolves could be more realistic than anything, but at least the other books were relatable. There were several times in Breaking Dawn that I just found to be too far into the realm of make believe and I just couldn't understand why Stephanie Meyer would do that after all the wonderful build up and success in the previous books.  In the end, it was well worth the time and money that I invested into the saga and I look forward to the movie adaptations. I only hope they do all of the books justice as it they were one heck of a ride.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|Until recently, I didn't make a big deal out of HDMI cable.  If your anything like me, you know about HD and HDMI cables but cable prices are all over the place.  Its hard to know if there is really a difference between the cheap cables and the more expensive ones.  As more and more electronics come with HDMI inputs you will have to make a choice in which HDMI cable to go with.  I have tried the cheap cables and they are usually thin and not that firm at all.  I have also tried the expensive cables with do make a big difference in picture quality but they are expensive.<br /><br />This cable is priced right and it's MUCH better then the cheaper cables.  The cable is thick, firm, shieled and an improvement over the cheap cables I was using.  If your looking for a cable that not cheap but not expensive, this is a GREAT fit.<br /><br />I use the high end cables for my home entertainment and  really can't tell the difference between the cables.  If you don't need to go high end but want a quality HDMI cable, look no further.  This is the 1 you want.<br /><br />Oh and the packaging.....priceless!
B002IVLH6A|1.0|This album is garbage, complete radio friendly, tasteless garbage.  I laugh at how Pearl Jam wont acknowledge yet insult their \\"grunge\\" roots when Vedder simply wears shorts on stage.  It's pathetic.  Another no talent, over blown, overrated band to add to the grunge, no talent 90's bomb fire.  I wouldn't be shocked or care really if this is one of Jams last albums.  The pop and new wave infusion makes them suck even worse.  Ten is all you need by this band even then that one is overrated.
B002DKGWSE|4.0|This Last House remake is a very good movie.  I would recommed it to anyone.  It kept my interest throughout the movie.    The only problem I had with this remake is the fact that in the original Last House the two girls were very attractive.  I found in this remake the girls were not that attractive at all.  I suppose that was done on purpose but I found it detracted from my enjoyment of this remake.  I went back and watched the original afterwards and thought it a better movie.    The thing I really liked was how this remake and the original movie were different.  Why remake a movie if it is exactly the same.    Over all I give the remake 4 stars.   The origianl 5 stars.   KC.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|This movie is soulful and true to its story. Kristofferson and Streisand have so much passion creating so much heat between the two of them. I also feel it is Streisand at her absolute honest best. The sound, the feel, the love. All a must for a collectors collection. I love it.
B00005JO9J|1.0|I bought the first season because some friends are always raving about this show and I wanted to watch from the beginning.  Uh...never mind.  While MILDLY entertaining, it gets old quick. It is incredibly predictable and the characters are totally implausable.  The lighting is so affected and those constant musical vignettes drove me crazy. I gave it up after three episodes.I found it to be maudlin and sappy.
0890090572|5.0|If you love reading; If you love suspense, drama, mystery, action, comedy and Sherlock Holmes (I do) this book is PERFECT for you. When I got this book I could not stop reading it. It is absolutely addictive. And when I finished, I read it again! I will read/watch anything that pertains to the great master and his ever so present sidekick Dr. Watson.  Just when you think you know, you really don't know. Why try to guess. This book will throw you for a loop over and over. You will laugh, you will be thrilled and amazed. This is the definitive Sherlock Holmes compilation. One right after the other. If you finish this book in less than a week, just remember I told you so. Arthur Conan Doyle was a true master at his craft and he never lets you down, even in his shortest of stories. And the Baskervilles of the Hounds, a wonderful read. Okay, no further. I do not wish to spoil anything for you. Now go read this book.<br /><br />Enjoy :)<br /><br />A happy Sherlock Holmes Fan...
0920668372|1.0|I thought the book was okay until it got to the part where the mom drives across town, sneaks in her sons window, and rocks a GROWN MAN to sleep.  Creepy, strange & weird come to mind here.  If my mother-in-law drove to our house, crawled in our bedroom window & rocked my 37 year old husband to sleep...I would have them both committed.  Too strange for me.  Later, the man is rocking his senior adult mother to sleep.  Again, weird.  I would think it was strange if my mom was rocking my Grandmother to sleep like a baby.  Who does that?  This is the creepiest book I have ever read.
0439023483|4.0|In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humaniy and life against love.     Things I liked:   -Katniss, I liked that she was the stronger out of the two (meaning Peeta)   -Rue, she and Foxface probably were my favorite of the tributes (other than the obvious)   -I am undecided if I am team Peeta or team Gale. I like them both but there wasn't much time spent on Gale, so maybe I will have to decide once I read the sequel.   -I liked that the action was spread out throughout the book. Often times I read something and it's just fluff up until the last 50 or so pages then it's just straight action.   -The book had a very Ancient Rome feel to it, which tied into the gladiator games they would have back then.   -The feel of this book kind of reminded me of Graceling by Kristin Cashore, could be because I just recently read it. But I liked the feel this book had and the world that was weaved.     Things I disliked   -It was a little slow to start, and I felt that there were some parts that were overly detailed and I got a little bored with them.   -Spoiler - I didn't like it that the rules of the games were changed after 70 odd years to allow two players to team up just to accommodate Peeta's survival and a love story. Now I love romance, and I in no way wanted him to die..but to me it's just too convenient. Not every book has to have a love story to be popular. The author could have just as easily created a way for the two of them to escape from the games. Throughout the whole time they are in the arena I kept wondering why no one hit a wall or something that the could escape over?   -I thought there were a lot of times where Katniss has flashbacks of times from her childhood, I liked a few, but I thought there were too many and it slowed the story for me.   -I kind of felt that Peeta's personality changed after Katniss and Peeta team up   - Spoiler - I thought that it was weird that no one seemed to mind that the other tributes were turned into some kind of dog at the end of the games. If I was watching that I would be like \\"What kind of world do we live in that this is ok?\\". It's one thing to make people fight to the death, but it's another to experiment with them and turn them into something other than human.   -I wanted to know more about what else is out there besides Panem. Maybe that is answered in the sequel.     Overall a really good read. Although it was quit violent. I am pretty squeamish and there were some parts I almost thought were too much, but that's just me. I'm interested to see what the sequel Catching Fire will hold. I give this 4 out of 5

B001IMFHTS|5.0|If you look for recordings of Beethoven symphonies, you will easily find #3, #5, #6, #7, and especially #9. My impression for many years was that the other four weren't worth listening to. This DVD box set with Claudio Abbado, the leading conductor of our day, dispels that notion. Under his baton, they are all beautiful. He is as graceful as a cat on the podium and Santa Cecilia Academy in Rome is such a stunning location that this beautifully mastered DVD set is mandatory.<br />The Seventh Symphony has long been my favorite, but I would like to watch it a few more times along with the others to see if I need to change my mind (the Eighth sounded pretty good last night).
B002BSHWUU|5.0|The new Beatles remastered CD's (Stereo versions) are absolutely awesome.  The Amazon price was well below any other offers that I saw and I am more than happy with the purchase.  This has been eagerly awaited by Beatles fans for over 20 years and I must commend the engineers for a wonderful job.  My Bose system provides a concert-like experience and my children and I have sat through repeated listenings with awe and wonder of the clarity of Paul McCartney's bass lines--try Baby You're A Rich Man and tell me that the music doesn't just travel right through you--the harmonies, and the musicianship that is the Beatles. MANY THANKS to Amazon for a great price (I caught the early deal!) and for those responsible for doing this music right.
0375854819|4.0|I don't usually write reviews to products on Amazon, but once I saw that the only review to this wonderful book was practically a spit in the young and talented Christopher Paolini's face, I felt inclined to do so. I will however, keep my review short and to the point- because as Shakespeare says \\"Brevity is the soul of wit.\\" (Unlike the angry, disrespectful critic above.)    Brisingr continues the series of the \\"Inheritance Cycle\\" with exciting in-depth details. The \\"side stories\\" as the reviewer above mentions, are just as captivating as our protagonist's (Eragon's) tale. The character development is wonderful and while there seems to be a great deal of similarity in this novel to Tolkien and Funke, there are little things that make this story incredibly unique. For instance, Paolini's writing style is not only wonderfully painted, heart-felt, with gorgeous aesthetics of the land of Alegaesia that can only emerge from the mind of a genius, but it is thrilling and suspenseful.    This was probably my favorite book in the series and ties in the others quite well. I'm not going to lie, the so-called shocking revelations were not at all surprising in the least and one of the scenes seemed a bit far-fetched, even for a fantasy based story line. Those two small criticisms, however, were not nearly enough to tarnish the astounding writing of Paolini. Might I also add, that these \\"mistakes\\" will vanish with age. Paolini started writing the first of the series when he was just fifteen years of age! It was published when he was 19! This series was meant of young adults and the bottom line is this: If you liked both \\"Eragon\\" and \\"Eldest\\", Brisingr will not disappoint.
0061703257|3.0|While I found the character development was ok, somewhat stiff and forced in some situations and while there were parts of the book that lent to some suspense; it was overall predictable. I pretty much had it figured out in the middle and finished it simply to see how the author would explain it. It is one of those books where you pick it up, say to yourself,<br />\\"I bet (blank) is really what is happening\\", and yet you read it just to see, only to be disappointed that you were right.<br />The author does well at painting a good mental picture for the reader, but as I stated before, I was very disappointed with the end.

0446401307|3.0|I really like Michael Connelly as a writer.  He has creative stories and I think his dialog and location settings are very true to life and believable.  He includes little details about the way Harry Bosch moves or acts that really paint a scene like no other writer I can think of.  And in his previous books I have really been drawn in by them.  The problem with the Overlook is that the details go overboard.  Some of the same information is given again and again inorder to set the stage.  I found the book tedious and hard to get through and I skipped pages here and there to get on with this story.  I am a big fan of Michael Connelly and Harry Bosch and will certainly read his next book.  But this one was hard to finish.
0385504225|4.0|I've read all of Dan Brown's books and especially liked the previous two with the Langdon character.

B002KDUDG6|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Michael Buble's so of course I was so excited to get his new CD.  And I'm definitely not disappointed!  The songs he covers this time aren't quite as popularized as some on his other CD's, but he definitely does them justice.  Overall it's more of a softer feel than his others - not quite the big band feel, although the arrangement on Cry Me a River is anything but bland - I found myself focusing on the instrumentals because the arrangment is so amazing.  I was a little worried about Georgia on My Mind too, because of Ray Charles' rendition, but he definitely held his own on that one too.  Overall, it's definitely worthwhile buying!
B00267N3DQ|5.0|I was thrilled to receive my Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (DVD/Two-Disc Blu-ray + BD Live w/DVD packaging) [Blu-ray] edition.

I learned about Gary because of one of the tools he preaches about in his book Crush It! The spreading of messages and communicating via social media is a powerful and immediate conduit for building your personal brand. And Facebook is how I found out about Gary.<br /><br />My friend Tyler responded to a post Gary made on his Facebook page - which prompted me to contact Gary. His publicist sent me a pre-release of his book. After reading Crush It! I'd like to recommend this book for anyone who is an entrepreneur at heart, or who wants to become inspired in today's new world of marketing, branding and transparency - especially during this time of social media overload. Crush It! is set to go on sale October 13, 2009.<br /><br />Storytelling is by far the most underrated skill in business. Gary's story is the `epitome' of the American dream.

Authenticity is key. Opportunity lies in transparency. Entrepreneurs don't really have a choice. The lines between public and private life are becoming increasingly blurred. Gone are the days where businesses could con the consumer without repercussions.<br /><br />It's a new world. There are huge opportunities that lie ahead for those who want to embrace them.

B001TH7GT6|4.0|I chose this cable to bypass the connection from my [[ASIN:B000ER5G58 TiVo Series2]] to my [[ASIN:B001418W2C Samsung 1080p LCD HDTV]] to make it from my TV to the Optimum cablebox.  The result? Pretty Darn Good. The video cable provides a excellent picture, supporting High Definition (HD) programming in an outstanding way.  The cable provides excellent quality short of an HDMI cable.<br /><br />The drawback? This is only a video cable. This means that you need an audio cable to go from your TV (or any other device) to a device of your choosing. So, please remember to hook up your audio cable.<br /><br />The cable is 6 feet long. This is excellent if your TV is a bit separated from the rest of your electronics. Personally, I would prefer a shorter version if one was available, to scale back on the amount of cables at the back of my TV system. Honestly. 3 feet is the ideal for some people.<br /><br />The cables are easy to grip but, a bit hard to insert as they are too tight. I had to push into the connections. I feared damaging my TV (I love my TV and treat it tenderly).<br /><br />The cables are color coded to make pairing them to the right connectors easy. Also, they are gold plated and thus provide one of the best signals.<br /><br />The frustration free from Amazon dramatically reduces the amount of extra...stuff...and makes easier to be green.
0385504225|3.0|This was a fine read.  It is a heavy burden for the author of DC to overcome expectations.
0385504225|1.0|This book is great bedtime reading...if you ever have trouble with insomnia, it will bore you right to sleep. I admit I bought into the pre-sale hype for this book. I loved The DaVinci Code, Angels and Demons, and Deception Point, and so I eagerly anticipated Brown's newest release. What a let down!  I trudged through the first 100 pages--and literally fell asleep at least a half-dozen times. Kept thinking it HAD to get better, so I started \\"speed reading\\" through the next 400 (still not willing to give up on it entirely).  I think maybe Brown's contract stipulated a per-page payment, because there was soooo much repetition and completely unnecessary drivel! I am so glad I got this book from the library (first on the reserve list for months) and didn't actually purchase it, so at least I only wasted my time and not my money!
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I bought pregnancy fitness DVDs with trepidation. I have never been much of a fitness fan. I tend to be a bit of a lump. But with my last pregnancy, I gained 80 pounds. As a result of being so heavy and off-balance, I fell and broke my foot, and spent my last trimester in a boot, hobbling around. I was in terrible shape by the time the baby was born, and it took me a year to lose the weight. I am not the type to be obsessed about my weight, but an extra 65 pounds (after baby was born) was pretty unhealthy.     My point being, this time I am determined to stay fit and limber so I won't gain more weight than is healthy (25-35 pounds is recommended), and I won't strain, sprain, or break anything as my body changes. I am at 20 weeks and have been doing this DVD about 3 times a week for a month or so now. At first, it was seriously challenging, mostly because she calls on you to stretch and strengthen so much, especially the thighs! But I feel more energetic and stronger as the weeks pass, have less aches and pains, and I think this workout has really helped. I intersperse it with other DVDs and styles to keep it interesting, but this is by far the best of the 4 I currently own, in  my opinion.    Also, my husband and I are MDs, and the idea that there is anything distinctly unsafe about this workout is ridiculous. I have read that expressed in a couple of other reviews. There is no jumping around, straining of muscles, or any suggestion to lose weight or overexert yourself. This style of workout may not be what you like, but it is not unsafe, if you stay at a level you are personally comfortable with.    Oh, and the partner part is so fun, if you can talk your partner into doing it. I am lucky enough that my husband tries out all of my workouts with me, and we have a great time with the partner workout. I think it really cute to watch Erin and her husband interact.
B001MYIXAW|1.0|I have found the theatrical version on regular DVD at Best Buy and Target. However, I have not found a theatrical version on Blu-Ray at any store nor through E-bay. Has anyone out there found a theatrical version on Blu-Ray? For those reading a review for the first time, the movie is great but the first attempt at DVD sucked due to poor subtitles. Look for a version that says \\"Subtitles; English(theatrical)\\".
B0000584V3|5.0|I got this album about 2 years ago, and at first I hated it because of the death metal vocals.  I had read plenty of very positive reviews on this album and I REALLY wanted to like it.  But it just wasn't do anything for me.  I let it collect dust on the shelf for a while, and the only song I would half listen to and like was The Drapery Falls.  This is one of their more popular songs.  They usually close their live set with this song.<br /><br />  Fast forward a couple of months and all of a sudden my opinion on the album drastically changed.  And this forever changed my taste in music.  All of a sudden I started digging their sound.  I finally \\"got\\" what they were trying to do.  Their style is pretty varied from time to time, and I started listening to it over and over again and soon I had to buy more of their albums.  I even introduced my best friend to the album and he started loving it too.<br /><br />  This is an album that comes along once in a blue moon.  A \\"classic\\" in its own right, not a lot of bands will ever achieve what Opeth did on this album.  Usually known as their \\"breakthrough\\" album, it combines great msuicianship with a great (very dark) theme.  I love how it opens with The Leper Affinity.  It is the perfect opening song and you can tell that they're just getting started.  The song ends with a great little piano piece that surprised me at first when I heard it because I didn't expect something that beautiful to be on such a \\"brutal\\" album.  But my favorite moment on the album is when it's coming to a close.  The song Blackwater Park ends the album nearly perfectly with the lyrics \\"Sick liasons raised this monumental mark, the sun sets forever over blackwater park.\\"  You can really tell that everything is coming to a close.  Just listen to the almost unrelentless double bass that epically ends the album.<br /><br />  This album has made Opeth my favorite band now and has opened my eyes to so much more in the music world.  I have since bought all of Opeth's albums and have been to three of their concerts.  They are also extraordinary live.  If you like this album, I suggest you check out every single one of their other ones because they are all very polished and very worthy of many listens.<br /><br />Notable Tracks:<br /><br />Bleak<br />The Drapery Falls<br />Blackwater Parkalbums and have been to three of their concerts.

B001TH7GT6|5.0|I needed a component cable for my new HD TV, so when this came up as an offer on the Vine program, I was thrilled.  I was even more thrilled to see how durable the cable itself appeared to be....and it was very easy for even an electronic dummy like myself to hook up to the TV and cable box.  Great picture as a result, great choice, and I am thrilled with the results.      DYB
0316017922|4.0|An interesting account on how some people become icons in their field.  Gladwell covers everything from sports, to high-tech, to legal and entertainment professions.  All with facts, opinions, and interesting biopics.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|Sometimes you watch a movie just for the fun of it. This is one of those movies. It will never rank alongside \\"Gone with the Wind\\" or \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" as a great movie, but damn, it's fun. Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds are completely hilarious (not to mention very easy on the eyes) and have absolutely great chemistry. Both are at the top of their game and turn in exceptional comedic performances. Toss in an award-winning performance by the amazing Betty White, a solid cast of outstanding actors and you're guaranteed a good time. Sure, the plot is predictable, but who cares? When you have all that talent on the screen in one movies, and are too busy laughing to analyze it, it doesn't matter. I rented the movie, but now I intend to buy it. It was that good!  If I were just rating the actors, it would be a five-star movie in my book.
B001K3JF7K|4.0|Love the way Krall does the soft, oldie love songs and this is more of the same. Full instramentation. Good selections - but a bit a copy cat of first hit. She is just as good/better on piano, I would buy two of her CD's if she did only mellow Jazz piano. Worth it. Buy it and relax.
630542845X|4.0|Package arrive in about 8-day from a forwarding point.  Touching, meaningful with strong message on humanity.  Too bad it can't be played in my D.V.D. player and I've watched it on a P.C. instead.
B0002U0UKS|5.0|First, the movie: The first time I saw the movie I was deeply moved by the BEAUTIFUL landscapes, unlike anything I've ever seen in a cartoon. The story line was a bit complicated, but the music and the beauty of the movie were so mesmerizing that I and my family watched in over and over again. Each time we watch it, we learn something more. The story, like the music, is multi-layered.<br /><br />Now the music: What can I say?  The music carries you away by its beauty and intricacies.  It is haunting and happy and grand. My ten-year-old son is the one who continued to beg me to buy the music, he and the rest of my family love it so much.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the price is so high that it is almost out of reach. $49 for an album?  The price is a real setback, I almost decided not to buy it.  But then I thought of all the enjoyment we will have as a family listening to this music on cold winter days.  I've decided to buy it as a Christmas present for the family. If the price wasn't so high, I would also buy the soundtrack for Spirited Away.<br /><br />Since the price is so high, I would advise NOT buying the album unless you and your family truly love the music and would enjoy it for years to come.  Watch the movie and listen to the music first, to see if this is something that you would be willing to pay such a high price for.  That's what we did. The DVD is at my local library, I'll bet that you can find it in one of your state's libaries as well.  I hope this helps.
B0015I2P0Y|3.0|\\"Grounds for Divorce\\" is such a killer cut, I had to buy the CD.  I hate to say it, but, everything else on the CD has a depressing sameness to it.  None of the other songs are worth much of a listen.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|This movie reminds me of [[ASIN:B000VO04E2 The Complete Works of Mark Twain-- A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court  (Volume 5)]]<br />in which the person going back in time manages to screw things very badly; nothing comes out like the book said it should.<br />But the result is very entertaining ( I really liked when she had Darcy get his shirt wet<br />in a romance novel form!).<br />I suppose that you have to love the Jane Austin 19th century gold diggers<br />to get this movie. The husband hunt of the Bennet girls still makes for humor<br />today. The geek that the older sister is forced to marry and his very strange<br />brothers makes one sorry for them through time?<br />This movie is one of the most funny and entertaining that I have seen lately.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|The magic of Disney comes alive in this remastered version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  The colors are brighter, the sound is outstanding and the whole experience is wonderful!  This set comes with the standard DVD (great for car trips!) and the Blu-ray DVD of the movie and a Blu-Ray Bonus Features disk.     I hadn't seen this movie in years, and was anxious to share it with my children.  We popped some popcorn, snuggled together on the couch and watched the show.  My boys are 6 and 4 and were positively mesmerized!  They laughed at the dwarfs and were nervous about the \\"mean lady\\" and the poisoned apple.  I'm still humming \\"Someday My Prince Will Come.\\" The story is just as wonderful as you remember - true love prevails!    My guys also enjoyed the trailer for The Princess and The Frog. I had to promise to take them to see it when it's released.      Thanks for the fantastic job restoring this classic, Disney!  Can't wait to see what you release next!
B00000255F|5.0|It was the summer of 1975.  I was entering my senior year in college.  And popular music was languishing, still not recovered from the breakup of the Beatles in 1970. The music charts included such hits as \\"My Eyes Adored You\\" by Franki Valli, \\"Mandy\\" by Barry Manilow and \\"Love Will Keep Us Together\\" by Captain and Tenille.  The critics, just like myself, were waiting for the next \\"big thing\\" in music.  Something ground-breaking, earth shattering, mind-blowing.  The Beatles had done that with \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" a long 8 summers earlier.  Would we ever have an experience like that again listening to music?<br /><br />Then out of nowhere(well actually from the swamps of Jersey) came Bruce Springsteen with this album.  From the first drop of the needle, it was obvious that this was something special.  This wasn't KC and the Sunshine Band or John Denver...heck, this wasn't even Paul McCartney and Wings.  No this was something unique, powerful and important.  Music had its new voice.<br /><br />Bruce has gone on to make other great music.  He continues to provide 3 hours of some of the best live concerts you could ever hope to see.  But it was with this album, it was at that moment in August '75, that many of us got to have that experience for the first time.  The experience of Bruce's greatness.  The experience of his music transending the average, the mundane of daily life.  Taking us on a journey that we will never forget.
B00004RFCM|5.0|I bought this for a friend who had never seen the show.  Obviously she loves it.  Thanks!
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Looks great in BluRay on a hi def TV. This package comes with a BluRay disc, a DVD and an extras disc. We love it because we still have a couple old fashioned TV's in the house and probably will for some time. It's great to have options when watching a movie so having both formats is a plus. Top quality product all around!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This is a great show, awesome having all the episodes in one package. No commercials, all of the season one episodes, able to see all the characters as they go through the scenes. Great!
B00003CXCW|5.0|Gloria Swanson actually was able to get a second chance at a screen fame with this film.  She also proved that being a silent screen star was no barrier to being a great actress in sound pictures.  How she failed to win a Best Actress Oscar is beyond me!  The writing is fantastic, Bill Holden is wonderful and Gloria Swanson is terrific.  As an added bonus, Erich Von Stroheim plays Gloria's butler and ex-husband.  The story is enchanting.  I don't want to give too much away.  One of the great films.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|The familial chemistry of the Winchester brothers is back and harder than ever to beat for entertainment in this season.  This go round, each actor continues to bring a wide range of human emotion to his role and is man to the task as the brothers take separate paths.<br /><br />The conflict between brothers, demons and angels escalates this season.  Episode 1 begins with Dean crawling out of a grave, no longer a captive in hell, but uninformed as to why.  He quickly tracks down Sam and the two are off again, fighting, laughing, making choices, and interacting more intensely than ever before.  The \\"Supernatural\\" mythology introduced in previous seasons continues to develop and, by the end of the season, it's clear that this show could easily go another two seasons (and I hope it does).<br /><br />The \\"Monster Movie\\" and \\"It's a Terrible Life\\" episodes are excellent.<br /><br />(Probably the most bothersome thing about \\"Supernatural\\"--and it's not that big of a deal--is when Dean and Sam are working on a ghost case, discover the remains have been cremated and then say something to the effect of, \\"There must be a lock of hair around or something.\\"  I mean, anyone who's ever been alive must have left hair, fingernail clippings and microbes all over the place. . . .  Minor gripe.)<br /><br />And after four seasons, I still don't know who my favorite show-brother is, which (for me) is a strong indication of how well-written and well-acted this TV show really is.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|Disney has done wonderful things with this classic movie. This set is amazing, there are so many extras. My daught loves looking at all the sketches and deleted scenes. This is a great deal even if you don't have a bluray player yet you really can't go wrong at this price.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke was an AMAZING movie in every way, shape and form.  I'm very interested in the Japanese culture as well as Japanese anime. And I'll definately be watching more movies like Princess Mononoke!
B001AQTWF2|1.0|This cd would sell about 10 copies if it didn't have Whitney Houstons' name on it(thank god I didn't waste any money on it). Another reviewer had it pegged perfectly-tunes that are completely dated. The years of abuse have rendered Whitneys voice a mere shell of what it once was. Fans of Whitneys will buy enough copies of this schlock to make a respectable sales figure showing, but don't be fooled-she is washed up. Time for the oldies circuit.    *UPDATE* To the two naysayers who doubt I listened to this awful cd. I listened to the whole cd not once, but twice. It was worse the second time.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this DVD. Jillian really beats you up, but that's the beauty of it - and she does so in a way that is motivational and informative. She does a great job discussing the \\"hows\\" and \\"whys\\" of her program, and she focuses a lot on proper form, which is really important if you want to avoid injuries. She isn't phony or overly perky - it's just a straight-up butt-kicking workout.    I've been doing this workout to shed 20 pounds of excess baby weight, and I'm liking the results so far. Plus, you can't beat the fact that each workout is only 20 minutes long - even a busy mom can find time for that a few days a week!
0061914177|5.0|This book is written with a \\"leave your excuses at the door\\" type of tone that I appreciate in this type of \\"find your passion and build a business around it\\" book.<br /><br />He provides solid advice in only 142 pages (one book can't provide every single lesson known on the subject).  Anyone who wants to learn how to use social media to build a business and brand would not be disappointed unless you don't want to \\"work your face off\\" as Gary says within.
0385504225|4.0|A great story, especially for someone who knows Washington DC. However, I don't think it's as good as his first two books. In particular it went on too far - drawn out - as though the author was padding. BUT, I liked it.
0671449028|5.0|This book illustrates to children a great bed time routine by brushing teeth, bathing, pajamas, and turning off the light.  My two year old loves this book and knows what to expect when we are through reading.    I like that this book is hardcover, my daughter points out the different animals, and the setting is on a boat, which my daughter likes. The end of the book shows serene quiet activity which shows my daughter how bedtime should be.
B00005MP58|5.0|What a treasure--the story, characters, costumes, scenery and dialogue just sweep you away to another place and time.  It's a true classic.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I loved this movie as a child and wasn't sure it could be improved but I was wrong! This diamond edition is awesome, it has so many extras and the images are so much more sharp. My kids are really enjoying this movie just like I did when I was a child, only I think this version is better then the one I enjoyed!
0739340131|5.0|I've read World War Z twice, and bought the book three times now (keeps on being loaned out and strangely never returned!)... and this reading is even better than reading the book.  I'm not very good at making accents in my head, so getting to hear the individual actors was great. The actors (readers?) were very good at what they did. Excellent.  Highly recommended.
0553382152|5.0|I have read Embraced by the Light twice since my daughter Alexis died four and a half years ago  [[ASIN:0982235704 Remembering Alexis, Finding Perspective in Love and Loss].<br /><br />I have recommended this book to everyone I know who has lost a loved one.  The book is honest and, through its honesty, is inspiring.  I am most impressed by the fact that the author  waited seventeen years to write the book because she thought people would think she was crazy.  Embraced by the Light breaks through religious mumble jumble and gives us a view of heaven that makes us want to live a better life and helps us believe in the beauty and reality of heaven.<br /><br />Margaret Marshall Rhyne, Remembering Alexis, Finding Perspective in Love and Loss
0385504225|5.0|This is the most fascinating book I have ever read.  Very exciting.  A real page-turner.  Nearly impossible to put down
B001SRDDQM|4.0|I would like to start off by saying that \\"The Bell Jar\\" by Sylvia Plath is a very interesting, creative, humorous, and splendid book. It gets off to a slow start but, its gets a lot better! It can be confusing at some points because it goes into flashbacks many, many times. Also, the vocabulary of the narrator can be confusing too. It is mainly told in first person. The main characters name is Esther. She goes through many struggles including love, trying to fit in, mental illness, and depression. I would say that the reading level is high school, college, and up.Once you start reading it, you can not stop!
1401323820|5.0|Amazing,    What was originally a smart advertising for the TV show, actually manage to stand very well by itself. The story is solid, the characters lovable (even more because we know the 'people' they are based on), the storytelling is effective.     It even have the same 'flavor' than the tv show, you subconciously imagine the action as you would see it on tv while you read the book.    I really hope they will continue and that Richard Castle will soon write another book. Whoever the author really is, hats down. The only regret is that the book is only 200 pages.    At a time where less and less people actually read, I hope this will bring more people to the pleasure of reading a good book.
0684833395|5.0|What a read, hilarity and substance that goes beyond the humor to delve into the reality of being stuck in a no win situation.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|My first exposure to Dan Brown was in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" which I loved.  That was a fun book with puzzles (which you might even have a fighting chance at times of solving) and while straining belief (there's no such thing as a professor of Symbology), was fun in an Indiana Jones kind of way.  Then, I read \\"Angels and Demons\\" which I thought was decidedly worse in terms of writing style and in terms of the amount of disbelief we have to suspend (antimatter bombs in this era---no!  Head of CERN with a private jet--no!).  But, I thought, \\"That was an earlier book...\\"<br /><br />Sadly, this book shows that Dan Brown is not improving steadily as an author.  I'm glad that I bought this on the kindle, so I'm only out $10, but it would have been better to have waited and read it from the library...<br /><br />In short, there are numerous problems.  Unlike many people, I don't mind the professor droning on with lectures about the small details of everything.  I think that Dan Brown did manage to keep good pacing through most of the book.  But, his characters seemed rather flat.  The villain lacked complexity or greatness.  The ending (I won't spoil it) was a letdown and the whole \\"bible code\\" issue seemed like a copout.  Then, there were the factual problems.  I'm a physicist and the whole noetic science angle bugged me.  The things taken as fact in the book hold no validity in the real world and I could not suspend disbelief.  There seems to be a human desire to belief that in some mythical past, we knew much more than we know now and that things were so much better.  But, there is no evidence that the ancients had knowledge of quantum mechanics, relativity, etc.  We currently live in a relatively great time in human history.  We've conquered many diseases and technology is allowing us to improve life.  We've learned more about how this world works than the ancients ever did and we should acknowledge this.  Our ancestors worked hard to understand the world and did the bestthey could with the knowledge they had--they got some things right, but they got a lot more wrong.  In the lost symbol, Dan Brown would have us believe otherwise, but this is not the case.
B001JEWNQ0|5.0|This is perhaps the greatest children's fantasy ever written, and it's not only for children. It is quite profound, especially the second half, and I teach it regularly as part of a university course on \\"spiritual fantasies.\\"     We also read Ende's 'Momo,' another wonderful fantasy not to be missed -- about our obsession with \\"saving time\\" and how that affects our ability to live. I am amazed that this shorter novel is out of print in the US, but it can easily be ordered from the UK.
B001L1S1SK|5.0|Ugly Betty has been my favorite show since it aired in September of 2006, and I never grow tired of watching what happens on a regular basis. America, Eric, Vanessa, and Judith shine in their roles and make it a show that people can relate to. Everybody has a little Betty deep inside screaming to break free!!
0470477237|5.0|Socialnomics is an excelent guide to social media impact on business and society. Outspoken, essay to read and understand + accurate. Without the redundancy of so many intellectuals and the formalism of academic work Qualman introduces us to the real meaning.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Buble and a proud of owner of all of his other CD's. Although \\"It is Time\\" is my most favorite album of his, he did NOT disappoint on this one!
B0002W18MU|5.0|So many times these days we have artists release albums with mostly mediocre songs, with one or two hits that carry the CD into decent sales. Even a lot of Cash's work was like this to be honest. Not this latest Album! It is to be listened to as a whole. It is an incredibly emotional masterpiece and a phenomenal work of musical genius! Every song is fantastic, every song is emotional, his voice is full of heartache and sorrow and feeling. The album as a whole is very dark and painful and not meant to be broken up song by song. The compilation is near musical perfection. This is truly Cash's and Rubin's finest work!
B002HML6Y8|5.0|If you grew up on old horror movies like myself, you will really enjoy this movie! It starts out black & white and pays homage to earlier horror films. After that brief opening, it turns into a feast for your eyes and ears. The locals look colorful and beautiful...Transylvania has NEVER looked better! The cast is excellent, you can't really go wrong with Hugh Jackman & Kate Beckinsale...there's something for everyone! Lol! You have to take this movie for what it is...it's a fun summer type movie built around Dracula and Frankenstein. If you've enjoyed action packed horror movies in the past, you should enjoy this one as well. A very FUN movie experience.
0385504225|5.0|If you like Dan Brown's writing style you will like this just as much if not more then the rest of his books
0385504225|1.0|I started this latest of Dan Brown's potboilers a few nights ago, but managed to get through only 30 or 40 pages of his poorly constructed work before snapping off my reader. Having read two of Brown's earlier novels, it was obvious that the author has chosen not to heed his critics and seek a more thorough editor. That is an unfortunate choice, as most of Brown's problems are to do with technique than substance, and as a result all of those old problems are still present in the newest effort.    It's often said that the best writers are those that break the rules, but it appears that Dan Brown has mistaken that to mean that authors are great BECAUSE they broke the rules. This misapprehension in mind, Brown has set out to break the most important rule in writing--\\"show, don't tell\\"--as flagrantly, and as often, as possible. In place of vivid description, Brown awkwardly inserts numbers, brand names and statistics. Character background is misused in the same way one might misuse pepper at the table: instead of sprinkling a bit in each course, all the pepper is dumped on the appetizer, and the flavor is expected to carry throughout the meal. When Brown introduces a character, he will immediately divulge everything from jobs and motivations and religious affiliations to family trees and sexual histories. One is left to wonder, which bits, if any, is one expected to remember?    The past offenses are not enough, however. Brown is not one to rest on his laurels. He has managed to find one way to make his text even more irksome, and that's through pomposity. In an early scene, the protagonist Robert Langdon flashes back to a lecture he once gave on occult symbols. Despite the fact that the audience is comprised wholly of Harvard students, Langdon has to lead them by the nose through each leap of logic, patting himself on the back each time. The passage borders on the masturbatory, especially when one considers that Brown, by proxy of Langdon, paints these Harvard studentsas rubish, uncultured and slow.    At this point, a reviewer generally wraps up by plainly stating his view of the product in question and closes with a recommendation to the shopper. However, having said so much already, I don't believe it's necessary to clear up my feelings about this book. Read it if you want something to talk with a dim aunt about, but it's not worth much else.
B0027VTMAE|5.0|A wonderful take on the book 'The Club Dumas.'  The originally released standard-definition disc was so 'bare,' it did not even have subtitles!  The blu-ray does, but still lacks a healthy dose of extras.  I watch this movie over-and-over, it is a true classic.  Polanski cast such fantastic characters!  My absolute favorite is (if you've seen the movie) \\"UNSCRUPULOUS! THOROUGHLY UNSCRUPULOUS!\\" LOL
0385504225|3.0|The historical information is interesting, but the thrill is missing.  The villain was not so scary, and the ending was drawn out and unsatisfying.
0307455874|5.0|The book came on time and what a wonderful book it is.  Audacity of Hope gives us all something to think about. Yes, our upbringing may be tough, but if you hang in there and accept the opportunities that come your way, you too can be great.  Obama has inspired so many of us to take another look at where we are and where we hope to be. Its never to late to be all you were meant to be.  There are going to be some dark days, but we must keep hope alive, by doing positive things in our lives. We should not even think about doing things pertaining to crime and then going to jail. This is not what our life is to be, but going to school, excelling in our studies, graduating top of the class, and going off to college.  In addition, we should surround ourselves with positive people that will help you get to the top.  Obama didn't do it by himself, but he knew what it took to be the best and he reached that plateau.   I never thought I would live to see a black man in the White House as President. The people of all nationalities went to the polls and their voices were heard, and elected Obama, a black man to the White House. I am proud that he is our 44th President, and he has made a mark on society as one who gets it done. He nor his family are flashy, but good ol down home kind a folks.
0316066524|2.0|First off let me say that I didn't finish the book, but I had high hopes of enjoying this read--even anticipated setting aside time in a busy life to accomplish that which many posters have claimed is near impossible, a complete reading of Infinite Jest.  I read for pleasure and prefer books that offer \\"enlightenment\\" or fresh perspectives of social/psychological issues.  The narrative just never seemed to get off the ground.  Should I have persevered and given it another chance?  Probably, but there are too many other books I am compelled to read.  I really wanted to enjoy this after reading many positive, albeit cautious, reviews.  It is the first Wallace that I have attempted, but I found this both ponderous and pretentious.  Was he a good writer?  Certainly!  Do I want to sacrifice the time and effort to appreciate his exhausting prose----maybe later...
B00005NGAK|5.0|I love all of Michael Flatley's show but i believe this is my favorite. This show is amazing all the way through you get a taste of everything from dance to flute playing. The story itself is great and the violin dueling is terrific. Buy it you won't be disappointed.
0385504225|2.0|Having read Brown's previous work, I have to say this was a bit of a disappointment.
1439102813|5.0|This book is awesome and riveting.  I think it would be a must read for anyone who has loved ones with Alzheimers and to know a little of what they are going through.  The author did a fantastic job of making this a real life story.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Michael has a great voice !  Even if this is not your type of music, you would still enjoy his wonderful voice and the songs he sings on this CD. I totally enjoyed this CD and the songs he chose to sing on here, awesome voice !
B002MW50KO|5.0|Contrary to widespread opinion, Bob Dylan is in fact one of the greatest singers of popular music, in addition to being indisputably the finest songwriter of his generation.    Why a great singer?  Precisely because his untrained, unpredictable, technically limited voice has reached, moved, and transformed the lives of millions of people.    The Christmas album reconfirms that whatever Dylan chooses to do, he redefines it in ways that no one can ignore.  It's been almost a half century since he released his first album and he still ignites as much debate as ever.  Love him or hate him, Dylan commands attention and, more often than not, respect and affection.    He is an American original, in the same league with Marlon Brando, Muhammad Ali, Gertrude Stein, Jackson Pollock, Bessie Smith, Emily Dickinson.  Even if you don't care for his music, you know I'm right.  If you don't like Bob Dylan, I have to wonder if you like the human heart and democracy.    The finest tracks on this holiday feast of an album include \\"The Christmas Song,\\" \\"Must Be Santa,\\" and my favorite so far, \\"Little Drummer Boy.\\"    Purchasing this record is an affirmation of Dylan's artistry, undimmed as he approaches age 70, and a good deed for the homeless and hungry in our troubled nation--a nation that Dylan understands, interprets, and celebrates in his career and life.
B001W63DX2|5.0|This DVD proves a simple point: Iron Maiden are one of the best live bands of all time. Their ferocity and talent have not mitigated with age. At a time when most bands from their era have either become caricatures of themselves or nostalgia acts, Maiden continue to evolve and push the envelope of their music; they re-invigorate songs that they have been playing for over two decades and still keep them fresh and exciting. Iron Maiden are simply amazing in terms of songwriting and stagecraft. There are bands half their age who cannot rival their output. This is not just another token filler live album between studio albums: this is a document of these Metal veterans at the top of, and re-inventing their game as they play it. A must buy for fans and a good place to start if you are still not one. Up the Irons.
0375826726|4.0|I will not provide an actual review, I am just writing this to point something out.  Im not an expert on writing or anything like that but I do LOVE to read, and have read tons of books.  Those who claim that the series should have or could have ended with this book have no basis of claim because they have not yet read the last book.  No one knows what the plot will be like for that book or if the plot for that book and this book could have fit into one.  I do agree that in some places, this book tends to drag and that somethings do appear to be pointless and unnecessary.  However, we cant know this for sure because we don't know how the story will unfold.      I would also like to point out that it is not fair to compare Paolini to Tolken or Rowling because he is not on their level.  Yes there are some similarities between Paolini and Tolken but that could be said of a comparison of any two books of the same type or genera.  Almost everything anyone reads these days has been \\"done before,\\" in one way or another.  If I were to compare every thing I read to those 2 authors I would be in for a lifetime of disappointment.      I would also like to invite anyone to respond with a book worthy of a comparison to Tolken.  Not because I'm challenging you but because it must be a damn good book.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Having been hooked on this show since it's premiere, owning this one was a no-brainer.  For those unfamiliar with the show, think \\"The X-Files\\" for a new generation.   The cast is stellar (particuarly John Noble), the writing is top-notch, and each episode   leaves you begging for more.  The best part of the set is the dozens of special features. Ranging from the 'how they  did it' features spotlighting the show's awesome special effects to commentaries, they  are the perfect side dish for this set which must be owned by anyone that was as blown  away by this show as I am.  If you claim to be a sci-fi fan and you've never seen the series, just watch the first   episode and see how long you can last before watching the second episode becomes a top   priority.  A true television triumph!!!!
0545128285|5.0|This is a great addition to the Harry Potter stories and it adds understanding of the reason for the ring, rock and wand in the quest that Harry Potter is sent to complete to vanquish evil.
B002GZQY6Q|2.0|I guess I was hoping they would evolve into a harder sounding band. Nothing really grabs me listening to this cd.
B0001I561E|1.0|CD had a chip in it that does not allow the last 4 min. of the movie to be played very very disapointed
0143116371|5.0|Scott Schuman is one of the most influenced street-fashion photographers the last years. His book is his blog and that's it. All this people make feel the freshness of well-dressed and hyper aesthetic society with the knowledge of style in it's life. And I think so is a precursor for a better quality of everyday life, is an extension for better living and people with good manners and more confidence about their self's.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I own both the theatrical and extended version. and don't agree with the official amazon review. The extended version is simply a must-have for the following reasons:<br /><br />The theatrical version was hard to follow at times, but the extended version explains everything, so that the scenes and story-lines makes much more sense.<br />While running time for a theatrical version always dictate limited playing time, it becomes apparent two minutes into the extended movie just how much detail and clarification is lost in the theatrical version.<br /><br />Peter Jackson clearly envisioned the extended version as the film to watch, it's clear in the pace and rhythm of the editing which seems to flow much better.
B00000GAMD|5.0|Having grown up a prog rock freak in the 70's, the early and mid-80's were a tough time for trying to find music that hit the sweet spot between the visceral thrill of rock and the intellectual engagement of more \\"composed\\" styles.  With Yes on MTV and Genesis in the process of becoming Phil Collins' pop backup band, my discovery of this album by Marillion at a youth hostel in Switzerland was like a gift from the musical gods.  Essentially one continuous \\"suite,\\" Misplaced Childhood stands as the best of Marillion's work with original lead singer Fish and contains their one and only American chart hit (Kayliegh).  Highly recommended for fans of the Gabriel-era Genesis.
B001EN1R2M|5.0|Come on cru fans where are you??  This is by far the best cru album hands down!  From start to beginning it is nothing but balls to the wall rock!  And please give me more cow bell.  This album is gritty and completely different from all of their other albums.  Take it from me you won't be disappointed with this album.  A true rock classic.
0786860707|5.0|I HAD HEARD THIS BOOK REFERRED TO AS THE BIBLE OF ANIMATION! IF YOU HAVE AN APPRECIATION FOR DISNEY ANIMATION THIS REALLY HITS SOME GOOD TOPICS AND EXPLAINS CERTAIN THINGS AND GIVES BACKGROUND(HISTORY) BEHIND THE CHANGES ETC. GREAT IMAGES AND THE TEXT IS REALLY LARGE AND THEIR IS EVEN FLIP BOOK IMAGES LOCATED IN THE TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER OF SEVERAL DISNEY CHARACTERS WHO CAN BE PUT IN MOTION. I\\"M REALLY HAPPY WITH IT!
B0018RWD1S|5.0|I love this CD and the additional cd is really something! Her live performance is unbelievable.
B000003BD3|5.0|A collection of a live show that included John Lennon and Eric Clapton. It's great. I recieved it fast and in great shape.
B002IR3PSC|5.0|This long awaited release will surely satisfy any fan of Jethro Tull. Electric performance from the band at the absolute peak of their live game!  The version of \\"Thick as a Brick\\" featured here is the most dynamic and is my favorite video of all time, just a flawless, energetic performance of this classic. You also get the rest of the concert that was not filmed on audio, and sound quality is excellent! \\"Heavy Horses\\" in particular benefits from the remastering. A must have for Tull fans!
B0021L8UXU|5.0|Woody Harrelson is funny as hell in this movie.Definitely his best movie yet,he plays the part excellent.I strongly recommend this movie to anyone.
B000NXS66E|5.0|This is a great book to read if you're looking for plot, style, story and structure. John Steinbeck is obviously the best in all three categories. After all, the man did win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962. I was in the navy way back then, and we were right in the middle of the Cuban Missile Crisis, so literature was the farthest thing from my mind. But, after all these years, I've finally gotten around to reading this masterpiece and, I assure you, it is well worth the six hundred pages. Plus, the Penguin book format is so easy to manage.<br /><br />East of Eden is all about a man named Adam Trask who, after being discharged from the army and inheriting a small fortune from his deceased father, settled in rural Salinas Valley, California around the turn of the century. He bought a farm and, over the course of his life he survived a fatal love attraction, a horrid marriage, reared two sons, met some life-long friends and wonderfully colorful characters, and even tried his had at business. For the most part, heartache and sorrow were his rewards. Such is life. But that's just the storyline. To me, this book was more about style than story. The way Steinbeck constructed his story, developed his characters, twisted his plot, and the beautiful descriptions he used made this book a joy to read, as well as an enlightening literary experience. I thought it was great.<br /><br />I recommend East of Eden to anybody who is interested in reading his or her way through the American classics.
1591841992|4.0|I have a feeling this book should be rated 5 stars, however, I didn't read it.  I gave as a gift.  The recipient has told me that he LOVES it!  He's promised to share with me afterwards.
0971336334|5.0|This book begins as a very light and humorous vignette that slowly evolves into the dangers of depending upon one's \\"perfect exterior\\".  I have appreciated Oscar for 40 years and I only read this gem four months ago! It is truly one of my \\"classics\\".
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I'm 18 years old and just discovered Michael Buble's music I got \\"Its Time\\" first maybe two weeks before \\"Crazy Love\\" came out and I loved it of course!!...I bought \\"Crazy Love\\" the very first day it came out and WOW its THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!What else can I say Michael is amazing!<3 I'm getting all of His albums!!!<3
B002MW50KO|4.0|If you're Bob Dylan, you can make almost anything work.    I just received my copy of Bob Dylan's new Christmas album, Christmas in the Heart. Aside from the fact that all of Bob's US royalties go to the charity World Food Program, this album is a lot fun. Of course, you probably have to be a Bob Dylan fan to enjoy it, or maybe not.    Basically, Bob takes some traditional Christmas songs, recorded in very traditional Christmassy fashion (complete with appropriate packaging), and belts them straight out, as if he thinks he sounds like Bing Crosby, with no apologies for his aging but still effective voice. Personally, I still like the way he sounds.  He almost seems to get in your face with it by continually juxtaposing his voice versus the smooth vocals of his chorus singers.    Even if you're not a Dylan fan, you might have fun with this one, or know somebody who might enjoy it as a stocking stuffer.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|I loved this movie and the features that were included with the dvd were great.  My son and I watched it over and over.  I would recommend this movie to any one with small kids or just an adult who has a love for classics.
B001IA2PTK|3.0|This was a nice package including the book.  Unfortunately the beginning of the sound track was not working properly.  The rest was fine.
B000000WJZ|4.0|This was a nice reminder of a great band that I haven't heard in a while. The CD plays fine and it saves me some cash by adding to my music collection. Good choice!!!
1847245455|5.0|Larsson has neatly woven several intricate plots in the search for the answer to a cold case mystery. His characters are vivid and interesting. This book is slow to get into,as Larrson sets up the situation and characters. Then suddenly one finds oneself racing through this mystery anxious to discover its solution. It is definitely a \\"page turner\\" in the best sense of the phrase.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Though this album has a hint of sadness to it, it's still solid AIC. The title track brings tears to my eyes and still manages to rock me. These guys have been off for far too long and I look forward to catching to new tour. One of the best rock albums of the year
B00267N3DQ|5.0|Wow!  I have always been a Snow White Fan, but when I turned this video on for my Daughter I was in awe!  The picture quality was beautiful!  This remastered video of Snow White had me feeling like a kid all over again!  Disney does wonderful things!
B002JM1VJG|5.0|I just bought this compilation and I'm going to tell you first about the quality, not about the tracks.<br /><br />When I go home, I watched all the music videos one by one.<br /><br />First thing I can tell, I don't see remastered versions of any video, every one looks like the last DVDs or even the VHSs, maybe in the old ones you hear a better sound. Let me clear that I used a HDMI player in a HDTV.<br /><br />Now, one detail I saw in the \\"Justify my love\\" video, it's a little bit censored.. With a black box. For me, it takes away a bit of artistic value.<br /><br />Anyway, it is a MUST in your Madonna's collection.<br /><br />:)
0307266303|5.0|For those with attention-deficet disorder like me -- this book will befuddle you in the first part... but stick with it and it is a GREAT non-fiction story.  For those looking for a reason to run, you will find it here.  For those looking for a reason to wonder why humans are born to run, you will find it here.
B0000047CX|5.0|I read the reviews and I love Astrud Gilberto so I was sure I'd love this. And I do. Great music. Instant Classic.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Loved the movie, loved the musical and couldn't wait to receive the DVD so I could watch again at home.  Thanks for the fast delivery.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I have used this watch for 2 weeks now, and I am almost 100 percent satisfied with it.  First of all, it is very easy to use. After 15 minutes I knew how to access most of its features.    The touch bezel works great.  Even when it was raining I was able to use it with no trouble at all.    The battery life is not great, but it´s ok.  It takes about 3 one-hour workouts (5 days) to wear out the battery.    The GPS is not 100 percent accurate, but it is good too.  Sometimes the map shows my route as if I had been taking shortcuts through the bushes.  I would rate its accuracy as been 8/10.  It´s my first GPS device though, I don´t know if they are all like that.    The heart rate monitor is excellent, much better then my Polar. It´s more accurate (doesn´t show absurd values like the Polar does sometimes) and it allows you to change the battery instead of having to buy a new one when the battery dies.    Another great thing about this watch is that it allows you to select the data fields that you want to view during your workout.  So, you can configure up to 3 sets of data with 3 fields on each one to view during the exercise.  You can either change the data sets by touching the bezel or configure the watch to rotate through them.    The data transmission to the computer is very nice, too.  You only have to stick the usb receiving device into your computer and it detects the watch and retrieves the data.      So, after all that, I can say that it was a great purchase, and I recommend it for anyone who likes running and gadgets.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|From the first deep notes of orchestral fanfare, I was intrigued by this album. Cry Me A River showcases the range of Michael Buble's voice.  All of Me is a pleasant update to Duke Ellington's soulful rendition. Buble's version of Georgia On My Mind truly shines as it begins like a James Bond intro before melting into a soft and warm rendition of this standard.  Crazy Love, that lends its name to the album, is poppy and airy.  I prefer Van Morrison's version.  Haven't Met You Yet is a toe-tapping tune that tugs the corners of my mouth up.  All I Do Is Dream of You takes us back to big-band.  Buble croons his encouragement in Hold On to lift our spirits.  Heartache Tonight gives us a surprising, fresh look at the Eagles classic.  The rest of the album is easy and wonderful, punctuated by a fun Sharon Jones duet, Baby (You've Got What It Takes).  The more I listen, I fall deeper in love with Crazy Love.
B00168OIP8|4.0|FYI - disc comes with a digital copy, but the confirmation/serial code expired in Sept. of 2009.    Otherwise, the movie looks great on BD; clearly much money was saved on the production budget by not buying any bras for Rebecca DeMornay.
B000ZELISO|2.0|Okay, so maybe I exaggerated just a wee bit for the sake of a clever title, but for a movie about wizards, Half-Blood Prince sure goes light on the magic. The major plot points and story revelations that made the book so captivating ( i.e. the importance of Horcruxes, the battle leading up to Dumbledore's death, and the mystery of the Half-Blood Prince himself) are reduced to random \\"blink and you'll miss it\\" moments, if included at all, while the remainder of the 2 ½ hours is padded with unfunny romance blunders aimed at the pre-teen Hannah Montana crowd. Visually stunning as always, yes, but emotionally empty with no climax whatsoever. The director obviously had no vision of where he wanted to take the series and got absolutely nothing accomplished story-wise. I'm not criticizing based solely based on comparisons to the other brilliantly crafted Harry Potter films, or even to the book on which it is (loosely) based, although that is part of it. The bottom line is, it really is an all-around good example of bad film-making in and of itself.
B001KEGRC0|3.0|It wasn't what I expected. The rafting footage wasn't long and the whole movie was short in general. A few good shots but that's about all. Not worth my money
B002G1X350|2.0|The album just arrived and after a couple of listens this album will pretty much do nothing but collect dust. Vinland saga is an epic and will remain one of my most listened to albums but Njord lacks any of the energy that the Saga has. I've been waiting for Leaves' Eyes to come back to the US but if their next concert is going to feature this music, I think that I'll pass and wait for a Delain[[ASIN:B002A4Q652 April Rain]] or the next Epica show.
0061914177|5.0|Ready to take your energy and follow your pasion??? This book is it. Great job Gary V, can't wait til the next book!!
B000F8O35U|5.0|Product came faster than I thought it would and the condition was new as stated!  I would definitely purchase for this seller again!
B0002858YS|5.0|What a great little album! Deceptively cheerful, this album has the polished and glitzy sound of Vegas with the devilish undertones of stalkers, murder, voyeurism and sex. Great themes, interesting take, brilliant music. Mr. Brightside, Andy You're A Star and Midnight show are key tracks for me!
B001FB55MG|5.0|Bought this DVD for my granddaughter and she loved it.  I watched it with her and thought it was a cute story.  Would buy it for a child another time as a gift.  My granddaughter is 8 yers old.
B002MW50KO|5.0|i have hundreds of Xmas,am a Dylan fan & read all the reviews here & wanted to add i love this cd.  i agree with all the details in the 5 star reviews & won't repeat them, but what stands out is the sincerity & classic feel of the arrangements here.  it is warm & glowing like a warm fireplace & Dylan's raspy voice adds the spice & crackling of the logs.  for me, this cd feels like Xmas as much as Sinatra, Manilow or Bing.    unlike other big name stars who make the obvious Xmas collection, Dylan somehow was able to create a standard that makes me want to play it over & over.    definitely a keeper, from left field to center stage.
B00127RAJY|4.0|The DVD, some hand weights, and a towel (if you have carpet), and you're ready.  There's a modified workout for those just starting, and a \\"kick-your-butt\\" workout for those who feel more confident.  Recommended!
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|If you ever listened to 80's hair metal you've heard all of these songs before, except Steel Panther gleefully dispenses with the euphemistic language of that genre and gets right down to the point!<br /><br />Once a genre has been successfully parodied, the genre can never been revered quite the same way again.  Just as Matt Stone and Trey Parker (the creators of \\"South Park\\") mercilessly parodied bombastic and over-the-top action movie cliches in \\"Team America: World Police\\", so do these four ex-Metal Skool boys wreak equally destructive havoc on the Hair Metal genre with \\"Feel The Steel\\".  If their live show is half as fun as this record, please SOMEBODY e-mail me their tour schedule!<br /><br />To put it into the proper analogy context, Steel Panther:Hair Metal::Team America World Police:Michael Bay-type action films.<br /><br />You can't listen to these lyrics (which are sung to VERY good genre-specific music) without laughing out loud, especially at \\"Stripper Girl\\", \\"Girl From Oklahoma City\\", and \\"Turn Out The Lights\\".<br /><br />Pay attention to the lyric booklet too -- they even milk laughs out of the part of the song where the guitarist's solos are listed as lyric breaks.  Even the liner notes, credits, and \\"thank you\\"s are funny.<br /><br />80's Hair Metal was ripe for parody from the very beginning, but Steel Panther's aim for the comic jugular is dead-on perfect!<br /><br />They even got a professional \\"rock photographer\\" to shoot their cover photo.<br /><br />If you're not laughing while you listen, you just don't get the joke.  Steel Panther has helped strip away the glamorous and self-important sheen that the big Hair Metal bands covered themselves with.  You may still enjoy your Poison records after this, but try not to chuckle too loudly or Bret Michaels might hear you.
B000GY729M|5.0|can anything be gritty and glam rock? This album sure can! What a great combination, what a great concept and a great sound. Fun and fantastic!
B00284BMBM|5.0|This is another home run for Daughtry.  Entertaining from start to finish.  I hope Chris keeps making records like this.  The lyrics and the way he sings them speak to me of the emotions he felt when he wrote them.  Very powerful.  The music is even better with his band then with the studio musicians from the first album.  Very impressive.  I thought his first record couldn't be topped.  I was wrong.
0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown is getting lazy. I loved Angels and Demons and was amused by the Da Vinci Code but this book should have been under a different author's name. The movie will certainly be entertaining and probably cheaper than buying the hard cover of this book.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|This is a great cable, I love it.<br /><br />The cable is very high quality, I've been buying those (10-12 dollar) hdmi cables online for a while, and I keep forgetting the nice feel of a high end cable.<br /><br />The moment I unpacked this cable, I realized I was in for a special treat.<br /><br />The cable performs flawlessly, without any objections.<br /><br />The cable is nice, thick, cable with a great texture and feel.<br /><br />I dont if it's just me, but when I used this cable on my ps3 my movies started looking much better.  The softness was lessened (in my eyes)<br /><br />I've used this cable about 100 hours by now, watching blu-ray playing games, hooking it up to my computer, my camera, my xbox, my ps3, and everything performs greatly.<br /><br />Thanks to amazon's amazingly low price, we can finally get a high end high quality cable, at a very reasonable and competitive price.<br /><br />Thanks amazon!  Time to buy another one!
B00005K3OT|5.0|When chocolate making harmonizes with our passions, and the chocolate maker is Juliette Binoche, total success and delight are inevitable.<br />While awakening passion in everybody's life in a small village, Binoche faces the classic struggle between being true to one's self and following what is supposedly the righteous way forced on us by others.<br />Each character in the movie is a forceful presence and each plays an important role in this wonderful story. The short appearances by Johnny Depp ignites a fascinating emotional spark between a noble man and the family of a single charismatic woman and her smart daughter.
B000WCDI5K|4.0|awesome album, awesome covers, awesome reworkings of b-sides. Where the White Boys Dance, Indie Rock and Roll, Romeo and Juliet, Tranquilize, Under the Gun are winners for me. Love it.
0545123267|3.0|Cute is not a bad thing, but it's the best adjective I have to describe this book.  It wasn't terribly gripping or exciting, it wasn't boring either; it was just...cute.<br /><br />There were several parallels to Twilight: inspiration or uninspired?  Either way the similarities were hard to ignore and I am leaning towards uninspired.  It's a tepid Twilight with werewolves in place of vampires. Werewolves just don't have the danger and allure of vampires by the fact that werewolves don't need to kill humans to survive.  Lacking that crucial element makes the forbidden love story a little less dangerous and less exciting by default.<br /><br />The story has just enough action to keep the pace strong and a Disney worthy ending tied up in a neat little package.  It is cute and I'm sure some teens will enjoy it; I found it readable but a little bland.
0385504225|1.0|Dan Brown must be paying people to write 4 and 5 star reviews after all the honest 1 and 2 star early reviews here because no one capable of reading could possibly give this book more than 2 stars.  For all the reasons stated here in reviews over and over (cartoon characters, repetition, silly italics, implausible plot points, boring, etc.) LOST SYMBOL marks a low point in publishing.  I bought it suspecting a train wreck and was not disappointed.

B00024I2Z4|3.0|Upon its release, \\"Mulan\\" was seen as an improvement over the relatively-forgettable \\"Hercules\\". And rightly so. That said, it falls short in comparison to the earlier Disney films of the decade. The songs are subpar, the animation lacks the elegance of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" & \\"The Little Mermaid\\", and the characters are anything but memorable. I applaud Disney for the story (yes, I know it's based on a Chinese legend), but that's about it. Thankfully, Disney resumed to top-notch animation a year later with \\"Tarzan\\". \\"Mulan\\", on the other hand, belongs more to the films they released in the 2000s: they're enjoyable but lack the oh-so-famous magic of their real classics.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Who's the fairest of them all?  Starting tomorrow, Snow White will be once again!  Disney is releasing Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition, a fun combo pack of a DVD and Blue-ray with special features.<br /><br />Originally released in 1937, as the very first animated feature film, it helped spur every little girl's fantasy of being a princess and finding her prince.  Of course, that included my little princess, who had never seen Snow White until One2One Network sent us the Diamond Edition to review (Yes, I should be labeled an evil Queen for not making sure she'd watched it before now.  I mean she is already four...lol).<br /><br />There is a reason that it's a classic, and won an Academy Award (including an extra 7 \\"dwarf\\" Oscars!) in 1939.  It still has the power to enthrall and makes us shiver at the witch, even after all these years.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is one where the extras make all the difference.  On the Blue-ray, the Magic Mirror is your host, taking you through all of the movie and even offering recommendations of what to do next.  There are several games including, Jewel Jumble and Dopey's Wild Mine Ride.  We didn't get a chance yet, to try Scene Stealer, which uploads a picture and inserts it on the face of a dwarf in the movie.  Finally, my son's favorite extra was Tiffany Thornton's music video of \\"Some Day My Prince Will Come.\\"  Most tweener parents will recognize her from Disney's Sonny with a Chance.  We also didn't have time to watch the featurette, Snow White Returns, that would have been similar to a sequel, if it had been released.<br /><br />This was a lot of fun, brought back a lot of memories, and definitely made some new ones!  Hubby had never seen this before and loved getting to watch his little princess enjoy it.  My 10 year old son wasn't thrilled with the whole story line, but thought the extras were a blast, so didn't consider it a total loss...lol.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I couldnt believe when the movie started how much detail you now can see. The color and sound are great! This is a must for your Disney collection!! Even the packaging stands out...well done!
0061767581|3.0|Fun and very easy to read.  It's interesting how she changed the names of the people but you can piece together who she's talking about based on the Hills cast.  I wish she would include more drama or more meat.  Seems like the book reads just like watching the Hills.  Lots of dialogue but not much happening.  I heard this book is being adapted to a movie...I guess it will be a movie of the Hills.  Hmmm.
0385504225|3.0|I have to agree with the other reviewers here.  The book was overall an OK read, but nothing truly grabbing your attention to the book that you have to sit and read it.    I anxiously got the book, and read as much as time would allow.  Getting into it, I figured out one main piece of the book very early on.  Not going to reveal any details, but I don't think I am smarter than anybody else here.  It was a fairly blatant.    In reality, this book could be under the Political Thriller category, but it is not thrilling, to be honest.    The conclusion was...uninspired, to me.  A long explanation that really is not earth shattering, and in reality, a bit of a downer.    I waited for this?  Boy, my life is truly exciting.
0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown is a writer of the first rank.  Moreover, he is an entertainer of the first rank.  His novels engender emotion, stimulate thinking, and even elicit \\"What are you talking about?\\" comments from the reader.  I have always been suspicious of critiques, especially those from professional litarary critics.  Seldom do they enter the fray themselves, (publish their own novels) but are content to bash the work of others.  (A good narrative of this philosophy can be found in Sebastian Faulks latest, A Week in December.) All novels are not intended to be \\"Classic\\" in the sense of, Shakespeare, \\"...now in our 400th year.\\"  Stageplays, of course, not novels for William. Most novels are actually written to simply entertain, or get the reader to think, or perhaps to be a cathartic excercise for the author.<br /><br />Still, I find that The Lost Symbol did not rise to the level of earlier work, but I recall some of the same feelings for Tom Clancy and I read each of his publications as well.  Not everyone hits it over the fence each time up to bat.  Good reading, driven plot (although I got tired of Langdon finally realizing that \\"it had been right in front of him\\" all the time.<br /><br />Well done, Dan.  Highly successful authors are allowed to hit a double once in awhile, (certainly John Grisham has) and come right back to bat with a triple, or over another \\"over the fence.\\"
B00127RAJY|5.0|This has got to be the best workout EVER!!! I did this 2 days ago and am so sore I can barely move. WOW. Never in my life after many years of doing various workouts have I ever been this sore. This will definitely be in my regular exercise rotation! I can't wait to see my results in 2 or 3 weeks of doing it. Two BIG thumbs up!!!!!
B000JQU4TW|5.0|I used the built in dictionary regularly with this story which is rich with precise descriptive language of the 19th century.
0385504225|2.0|It's not often that I get to the end of a book and think, \\"Really?  Why didn't I just give up somewhere around the middle part knowing, with disappointing accuracy, how the next half of the book will unfold?\\"    I think I would like Dan Brown personally, if I were talking to him and not reading one of his books.  He poses the occasional thought-provoking question, something insightful enough to distract you from the plod of the plot, diverting enough to get you through several more pages before the powerful suck of formulaic writing creates that now familiar sedative effect that I think I can predictably count on for any future creations about, what really should be, extremely engaging reading.    The issue as I see it:  the redeeming value of Mr. Brown's \\"The Lost Symbol\\" (and \\"Da Vinci Code\\") is that he pulls incredible factoids out of history, links them somehow to other amazing factoids, and creates a compelling thesis that makes you sit and think and want to know more about whatever historical object you thought you understood...truly interesting stuff.  I give him major kudos for making me go \\"hmmmm\\"; however, he really gets into trouble when adding a story that's used to present this interesting information to the reader.  Suddenly it's only mildly interesting, because you have to wade and struggle through dreck before you're surprised by one of these fabulous observations, and then you're back into the drudgery and waning interest before another bit of trivia startles you awake.    I really wanted to like this book and I suspect that's why I kept reading until the end.  Ultimately though, I would have preferred a 30-page PowerPoint with all of the interesting bits in bullet points and several hours of my life returned back to me.
B002436WFI|5.0|Great Acting, great filming techniques with superb scenery making the DVD a delight to watch especially in high definition.   The three hour plus length of the story line being in two parts allows for a coffee break or an alternate viewing day.
B000ANXLB2|5.0|This set features performances coming about 6 years after Karajan's 1962/1963 Beethoven cycle. That earlier cycle remains, and will likely remain, the definitive set of Beethoven symphonies for me (among over 100 Beethoven symphony recordings I have). Karajan's Beethoven is not \\"perfect\\" -- for example, he always skips some repeats that I deem necessary -- but he and the BPO really brought out all the qualities a modern listener thinks ought to be brought out of Beethoven's symphonies.<br /><br />The 9 symphonies recorded here are spread out over 3 DVDs. The visual take on all but the 9th was supposed to be artistic; most of them were directed by a renowned French filmmaker. But the visual qualities are uneven and on the whole unsatisfactory. It's not just Karajan dominates the screen time -- as with most other classical videos, the cameramen always seem to favor just a few angles and just a few select musicians.<br /><br />In terms of musical quality, as I alluded earlier, taken as a whole this is second only to Karajan's earlier cycle. I do like the 3rd symphony on this set a little better, but my friends disagree with me on this. But if you want solid, no, I mean great, Beethoven symphony playing, you won't be disappointed. Obviously, if you don't like the visuals, simply turn off your TV monitor and only listen to the sound.<br /><br />BTW, this set is better than the 1983 \\"His Legacy\\" set in both video and audio; that later set is notorious for focusing way too much on Karajan, and the BPO playing is less coherent than here. Abbado's 2001 set is also nice (see my review there), but IMHO Abbado cannot match Karajan in interpretive power or execution (plus the BPO was already at the start of its downward spiral). So, if you want one DVD set of Beethoven's symphonies to own, this is it.
0385341008|4.0|THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY is truly a great read. Though this novel is ultimatley heartwarming, it doesnt shy away from exploring some of the darker aspects of the war. With a broad cast of characters, a great way of storytelling, and a some little known fronts of WWII, this book will definitely pull you in.
0385504225|2.0|I sure hate to have to say this....  I'll keep this short.  This book was not at all what I would expect from Dan Brown.  Way too long.  Lots of rambling.  I can't give anything away, but I can tell you that I would skip this book entirely.  I'm going to pretend I never read it and go back and re-read Angels & Demons.  ; )
B0025KVLVA|5.0|*** PAST MASTERS 09/09/09 - STEREO and MONO Comparisons ***<br /><br />After the 13 official British albums by The Beatles were first reissued on CD (February to October of 1987), all the non-album tracks on UK 7\\" singles, the exclusive 4-songs on the \\"Long Tall Sally\\" EP and any other stragglers were then gathered up onto two separate CD compilations called \\"Past Masters\\" (Vol. 1 & 2) and issued globally on 8 March 1988 to compliment the main catalogue.<br /><br />This 9 September 2009 reissue of \\"Past Masters\\" combines both of those Volumes into one 2CD set. They've been taken out of their clunky jewel cases and given a tri-gatefold card sleeve (black in colour), new 2009 remastering (mostly Stereo) and a vastly upgraded booklet. Of the 33 tracks, 29 are in STEREO with 4 being in MONO - \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"She Loves You\\", \\"I'll Get You\\" on DISC 1 and \\"You Know My Name (Look Up My Number)\\" on DISC 2.<br /><br />However, there are differences between the old and new issues... The 1988 version of Disc 1 had 7 MONO tracks and not 3 (Disc 2 has remained the same) - the 4 now replaced with STEREO versions are \\"From Me To You\\", \\"Thank You Girl\\", and the two singles sung in German. But therein lies a further anomaly...<br /><br />Beatles chroniclers will know that prior to the issue of \\"The Ballad Of John & Yoko\\" in May 1969 - ALL of their UK 7\\" singles were issued in MONO-ONLY (\\"The Ballad Of John & Yoko\\" was their first STEREO single in the UK, while their first STEREO 7\\" in the US was as late as \\"Get Back\\"). So while the vastly improved liner notes talk knowledgably about each British single - this set is in STEREO when they were only ever issued in MONO! Some would therefore say that this whole compilation only compounds the mistake of the 1988 issues and is a further historical travesty. But I'd argue that accuracy's loss is the listener's gain - because these NEW STEREO REMASTERS are simply astonishing soundwise - they really are.<br /><br />The original masters tapes have been remastered by GUY MASSEY, STEVE ROOKE, PAUL HICKS and SEAN MAGEE with the whole project overseen by ALLAN ROUSE and they've all done a stunning job. \\"The Inner Light\\" by GEORGE HARRISON (the B-side to \\"Lady Madonna\\") is a good example of the sound improvement - it's just BEAUTIFULLY CLEAR - it's loud yes, but not amplified to a point where hiss drowns out the song (there's none). And listening now to Disc 2 especially, you're struck with awe at how good they were - these were only SINGLES for God's sake! Most bands would kill for a double whammy like \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"Revolution\\" or \\"Get Back\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Down\\". Soundwise - literally everything seems up for grabs - and in a thrilling way...<br /><br />The 2nd variant of \\"Past Masters\\" is ONLY available in the expensive \\"The Beatles In Mono\\" Box Set (not surprisingly it's been renamed \\"Mono Masters\\" - its white in colour). I mention this because if you actually want to accurately line up the British singles as released, then this is the place to start. In fact, it's probably already occurred to most dedicated fans by now that if you want the FULL UK 7\\" SINGLES PICTURE (1 to 19 in MONO, 20 to 22 in STEREO), you'll need BOTH variants, even if it costs...<br /><br />Here's a breakdown of their differences...<br /><br />Past Masters - STEREO - Disc 1 - 18 Tracks (42:31 minutes)<br />Mono Masters - MONO - Disc 1- 18 Tracks (35:56 minutes)<br />Tracks 1 to 18 are the same names on both discs<br /><br />Past Masters - STEREO - Disc 2 - 15 Tracks (51:00 minutes)<br />Mono Masters - MONO - Disc 2 - 16 Tracks (48:35 minutes)<br />Tracks 1 to 8 are the same names on both discs<br />Tracks 9, 10, 11 and 12 on the MONO set are - \\"Only A Northern Song\\", \\"All Together Now\\", \\"Hey Bulldog\\" and \\"It's All Too Much\\" (they're 4 songs from Side 1 of the British \\"Yellow Submarine\\" album)<br />Tracks 13, 14, 15 and 16 on the MONO set are \\"Get Back\\", \\"Don't Let Me Down\\", \\"Across The Universe\\" and \\"You Know My Name (Look Up My Number)\\"<br /><br />Given the absence of the Red & Blue 2CD sets in this reissue series, for me this rather dull looking double is the best of all the 09/09/09 releases - the song quality is incredible from start to finish and it also rather eloquently shows The Beatles extraordinary development from pop ditty songsters in 1963 to pure rock genius by 1969.<br /><br />OK, so \\"Past Masters\\" is not historically accurate, but I suspect for the average listener this will not matter - they'll be too busy enjoying the brilliance coming out of their speakers to care about chronology.<br /><br />To sum up (and despite niggles), for me the new STEREO \\"Past Masters\\" 2CD set is a winner - fab indeed - and thoroughly recommended.<br /><br />PS: For fans I've typed a detailed track-by-track breakdown in the 'comment' section attached to this reviewrather dull looking double is the best of all the 09/09/09 releases - the song quality is incredible from start to finish and it also rather eloquently shows The Beatles extraordinary development from pop ditty songsters in 1963 to pure rock genius by 1969.

B0013ND30M|3.0|I bought this for my daughter, thinking this would be a fun family-night movie.  I'll admit I don't particularly love the \\"princess\\" genre of Disney movie, and this met my low expectations.   I'm sorry I bought it because I doubt my daughter will ever want to watch it again.
B001CTDH76|4.0|There's nothing as great as discovering a new television series and finding out how unique it is! The Mentalist is one such show.  Having heard about it on tv ads, I decided to borrow Season One from the local DVD store and see for myself what this show was all about. It's a bit quirky, a bit black comedy, but alot of fun.  Simon Baker is perfect in the role of Patrick Jane, a pseudo-psychic who is always a few steps ahead of everyone else. His character is witty, intelligent, and a bit arrogant at times.  I can't wait for Season Two....

The blueprint Vaynerchuk lays out for us, isn't complicated; it just requires dilligence to use the power of the internet to establish your own personal business strategy---your \\"brand\\".  If you have as much passion and enthusiasm as this guy, you'll probably be successful in your endeavor.<br /><br />If you feel trapped by a boring job with people you don't like working with, this could be your escape; but you've got to make sure you're willing to put in some hours establishing your brand identity.

0571179924|2.0|I love the book, and know it is an older version.  But the book was in very poor condition, with some kind of stuff all over every page.  I guess I couldn't expect much more from a rare book.
B002436WFI|5.0|As a dyed-in-the-wool Terry Pratchett fan, I loved this movie! It had everything I expected to see from the first two books that introduce the fabulous world of the Disc. The visual imagery was perfect in every way, the special effects were awesome, and the casting was just brilliant--including a cameo at the beginning and end of the Author himself.     I look forward to seeing all of the Discworld books made into movies--I already have Weird Sisters, Soul Music, and Hogfather. May there be many more to come of this quality!
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I really do think that Snow White is THE #1 classic Disney movie!  To see it remastered is truly wonderful and on blu-ray too!  This is such a great package because it offers both the dvd and the blu-ray for those who might not have blu-ray yet or, like us, are just transitioning and only have 1 blu-ray and 2 tvs.  This is a must have for any movie collector!
0061537969|5.0|Wow! This is a beautifully-crafted \\"tail\\" that perfectly wags in and out of all the messiness of life all through the eyes of Enzo, a half-Lab half-suspected-Airdale Terrier. It has the perfect balance of gut-busting humor and tear-jerker moments tied together flawlessly through writing that is so superb you hardly notice it's a \\"novel.\\"     I am no lover of fiction, so much of it is overwritten and tries too hard, but \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is simply a wonderful story told honestly and with dignity, and of course, by one really creative dog. It truly is the best books I've ever read. If reading this book does not affect you in some way then there's something wrong with your idea of a good read.
0439023491|5.0|My 15 year old daughter read The Hunger Games, and thought it was one of the best books ever.  She has since recommended it to many friends, boys and girls alike, and all have been absolutely captivated.  Catching Fire is no different.  It appeals to teens as well as adults.  The topic of a violent future society is presented in an intelligent manner, and is one that stays with you after you've finished the book.  It is violent, and I would recommend it for children who are middle school age or above.  We are all eagerly anticipating the next book in this series.  If you area teen, or if you're looking for a book for a teen, this is the book you want.

0061914177|5.0|The first couple chapters were a little uneventful, but just because it was all back story on Gary, and his life (I've been watching his show @ winelibrary.tv for a while now).  This book lays out, step by step, how to build a community and monetize your personal brand.      The most valuable thing I learned from this book was how to create a personal brand.  It doesn't matter who you are or what you do, you should have a presence online.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I absolutely loved this series. Makes me want to jump up from my sofa (where I'm watching it) and go explore all this wonderful places on our planet. Most of the images are of places or things i had never seen before, the episode that I was most amazed is Caves. Such a bizarre an alien world, in our planet.  It is a fresh new view of all the things that are around us and we must take care of.  The only thing I was not so happy with, is a couple of images that were misplaced. In the chapter of the Himalayas there is a night video of Torres del Paine National Park in Chile, that is halfway around the world. And in the part that Torres del Paine is shown, two scenes are flipped horizontally, so I start to doubt a little bit about every other place in the planet, if it's shown as it is, or this new \\"poin of view\\".  Anyways the images are stunning, and the narration bby Sir David Attenborough is flawless.
0385504225|3.0|I almost rated this a \\"4\\" because it is definitely a page turner and it does contain a lot of interesting arcana and a moderate albeit superficial dose of interesting scientific and philosophical/religious ideas.    On the other hand, Brown's writing style grated on me like fingernails on a chalkboard (I don't remember the DaVinci Code being that way...although it may have been.)  All the italics, all the internalized questions, overuse of words like \\"chuckled\\" and \\"D.C.,\\" cliff hanging chapter after cliff hanging chapter, the droning preachiness at the end.....it was all a bit much for my taste.  And finally, I never did buy into why everyone including the CIA thought the incident was so earthshaking.    In the final analysis though, who am I to criticize Dan Brown and his writing?  This book cashed out more in its first day than I will in a lifetime.  It just could have been a lot more satisfying.
1878424505|5.0|The Four Agreements is a great book, one you wish everyone would read. Amazon is a very efficient way to order things like this and very prompt. Extemely satisfied.
0385504225|3.0|It is hard to follow \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and \\"The Lost Symbol\\" falls well short of that high standard. This novel is set Washington DC and explores the \\"mysteries\\" of the Masons. The main character is again Robert Langdon, the Symbologist. Mr. Brown's writing is not at a very high level and when the thriller is thrilling this can be forgiven. This thriller is only passably thrilling (the last 20 pages are brutal). A good thriller begs you to suspend disbelief and go along for the ride. A mediocore (or bad) thriller has you predicting the outcome (successfully) and wondering what the hell these people are thinking. Three strars may be generous.
B002MW50KO|4.0|All this talk about Bob's voice! He's not constantly touring and recording to get your goat. Like Charley Patton making records after his throat was cut, or Ernest Tubb touring with emphysema, Bob continues to do what he does with what he's got because he wants to. Yes, he sounds like a grizzled old man, but so did Mike Seeger and Jimmy Durante. Were they told to stop? Of course not.    If you don't like the standard Christmas repertoire, you won't like this. If you do like it but don't like Bob, you won't like this. If you hate both, you'll loathe this. If you get a kick out of Bob and still love the old-style arrangements, this album will add a dash of rum-pum-pum-pum to your holidays. I, for one, am glad he recorded it. Thanks, Bob!
0143038419|5.0|First of all, I read the Bali section before the other two and was quite impressed with the details she wrote and how she took her experiences to the highest level.    Since the members of the Book Club knew that I have lived in Indonesia, they felt compelled to invite me and wanted to hear what I thought of it.  I told them I had enjoyed reading the book and shared some of my experiences of the Far East.  Great book and I bought myself a copy for my favorite book collection!

The powerhouse of the album \\"One\\" gets support from \\"Mysterious Ways\\", \\"Who's Gonna Ride your Wild Horses\\", and \\"The Fly\\".

B000002J1U|5.0|The film \\"Almost Famous\\" is what encouraged me to purchase this album. The use of \\"Tangerine\\" from the album is perfect in the movie. Music afficienados would have to agree that Led Zeppelin III is a quintessential piece of music history, great for a library collection, and chalk full of Zeppelin greatness. The album contains the top hits \\"Immigrant Song\\", \\"Tangerine\\", \\"That's the Way\\", and \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\". A folk tuned album to Zeppelin's hard rock days, \\"III\\" presents a cornerstone to the folk-rock side of Led Zeppelin, while tantlizing the rock heart of many listeners.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|I checked our local stores and the price is good for this, the packaging is simple, no box cutter needed to cut a plastic package open (with the ever present risk of nicking the cable itself) and it looks fine (I guess, I'm no videophile, I don't think any cable could make a big enough difference that I would actually notice it.) I can say I've never seen any interference when I use this cable, and the picture is impeccable.   It's heavy duty, it works great, and the price is very good. I'd say it's a bonafide bargain.
0375831002|5.0|The Book Thief is a WWII story about a girl who is ripped from her family and placed in a small German town where she begins to form meaningful and often quirky relationships with her new adopted family, friends and neighbors. Yes, the main character (Liesel) steals books, but only ones that have been left for the taking. Once the characters of the small town are set in place, the author brings in Max, the Jewish boy who hides in the basement of Liesel's house. Max brings new purpose to the family who hides him. And although the reader never gets to fully know Max, his presence allows the other characters to grow exponentially. Beautiful relationships are formed within the Nazi horrors of the small town. The author does a tremendous job in showing the power words have in both destroying and building relationships.
0385504225|1.0|After 6 years of waiting, this book was a major disappointment. The historical information about the Masons was of course interesting, but the plotting itself is unworthy. Basically, the entire story is: Robert Langdon runs into a room, there's some long exposition where a supporting character teaches him something he didn't know, they run to another room where another character does the same. And on and on and on.     Plug in some lousy foreshadowing and a groan inducing \\"big reveal\\" and you've just wasted hours. I recall liking Brown's other work, but maybe 6 years ago I was more easily entertained. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|This is the first time I have posted a review - ever. Got these as an anniversary gift from my lovely wife (so no hope of upgrade even if I didn't like them#. I have a pair of Martin Logan speakers paired with PS Audio PCA/HCA combination which provides exceptional detail. On first impression - very detailed, stat like sound but linear response #evident even without the breakin). As noted, I can see the promised land is not far with a little patience. Contrary to many reviews, even with the slight edge, the sound is very pleasing. It is like the first few sips of a new wine, hopefully to open and reveal a myriad of flavors. Do NOT hesitate to purchase this headphone - especially for the price. Will follow up after the break in.
B0025KVLV0|5.0|i hocked my '87 remaster version on [...]or amazon a few years back. i though let it be naked was going to be an upgrade (although that cd was cool too). i still prefer the phil spector produced original. the remaster sounds good but i do not advise people to go out and re buy their whole beatles collection in this new remastered format unless you have money to piss away. regardless, this is a great beatles album which deserves to be up there with their very best albums...enjoy
B002KDUDG6|4.0|Singer Michael Bublé's  2009's CRAZY LOVE is one of his brightest, poppiest, and most fun. Bublé kicks things off with the theatrical, epic ballad \\"Cry Me a River\\" and proceeds to milk the tune with burnished breath. It's over the top for sure, ...what fun it is with Bublé swinging through \\"All of Me,\\" and killin' Van Morrison's classic \\"Crazy Love\\" with a light and yearning touch. And just as \\"Home\\" worked to showcase Bublé's own writing abilities, here we get the sunshine pop of \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" -- a skippy, jaunty little song that brings to mind a mix of the Carpenters and Chicago. Throw in a rollicking and soulful duet with Sharon Jones & the Dap Kings on \\"Baby (You've Got What It Takes),\\" and a fabulously old-school close-harmony version of \\"Stardust\\" with Bublé backed by the vocal ensemble Naturally 7, and CRAZY LOVE really starts to come together. Then Bublé goes and throws in a last minute overture by duetting with fellow Canadian singer/songwriter Ron Sexsmith on Sexsmith's ballad \\"Whatever It Takes.\\" the song is a modern-day classic ..  like the rest of CRAZY LOVE, is pure magic.

0307394549|3.0|The organization, pictures, and ideas are great.  The writing and instructions are simple and easy to follow.I love that there are a huge variety of cookies, so if you're someone who likes to experiment and try something new this is perfect.  I saw a lot of cookies I'd never even heard of or thought of making, so my housemates and I always have fun trying a new one every week.<br /><br />My only objection is that the cookies actually aren't very tasty.  A lot of them are floury, or a little bland, or sometimes too chocolatey.  I don't really know what it is, but most cookies I've tried comes up short somehow.  For example, the Lime Meltaways aren't quite lime-y enough, though you can easily adjust by putting in more zest or juice next time.  Even simple cookies, like chocolate chip or oatmeal, aren't as good as the ones based on recipes from Joy of Cooking or Betty Crocker.  My friend thinks it might be because she doesn't use enough butter and sugar, but I'm not totally sure.  There's a food blog out there that tries every single recipe in this cookie book - I can't recall the name of it, but the blogger seemed to also be dissatisfied by some of the recipes too.<br /><br />This cookbook is definitely best for holidays where you'd want to serve a huge variety of cookies and have fun with decor or impressing your friends.  But if these cookies were sold at a bakery, I might not be a returning customer.  They're not bad, just not good enough.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Snow White is a 1937 amimated feature which was the first full length animated movie in history and is considered a Disney classic.  The Diamond Edition Blu-Ray is out of this world.  The color, clarity and sound of this movie is superb and the story is timeless.  This will be a great addition to any collection or a nice Christmas gift for young and old alike.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Love this show. Found the rest of this season in stores and could never find season 2. Come to amason and found it right away. Got it for a good price and was shipped out in one day, was at house less than a week.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie and saw it twice when it was out in theaters.  While action-packed to the hilt there is an extremely well-done story and character development.    It's true the screenplay doesn't follow the '80s cartoon (which I watched back in the day) nor the comic books (which I haven't read).  But the question is...does it have to or need to?  If the story is quite capable of standing on its own it enhances the entertainment experience.  It doesn't diminish it.      As to the actual movie, the premise is simple enough.  There's a rising terrorist organization which has created a highly volatile weapon.  It doesn't care who it sells too...as long as it profits.  Or...so it seems.   There's a secret organization called G.I. JOE...a group made of the best operatives across the globe who seeks to thwart them from throwing the world into chaos. To say more regarding the characters and the roles they play on all this would be spoiling a bit of the film.    I can, however, say that yes....one of the characters does indeed say the classic  line:  \\"And knowing is half the battle\\"  even if in this case it's best to see the film for yourself.
B002M3SOWO|4.0|I bought the Percy Jackson books for my kids but of course i read them.  They're perfect for reading on a bus or train during a commute.  Easy to follow story lines, some nice semi-surprises and twists.  this is a series that needs to be read from the first book.  while there are repeated explanation as with any series, only by reading the books do you get the full understanding.  Of course the end suggests there may be more books on the way.  Looking forward to the Lightning Thief movie.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|The Rainbow Children is a Great album, it's not supposed to be Purple Rain or 1999 or Sign O the Times or any of his other albums none of them are the same.  If you want a Microwaved POP STAR Prince is not for you. I don't like overly religious themes but this CD is very creatively and cleverly done it requires thought which a lot of music lacks these days.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|I really like these gaming headphones. i got them cause all my friends were complaining that i couldn't play when they were. i have a 5 year old that goes to bed at 8:30 every night so loud distractions are not an option.     bottom line. they sound great with a gaming system and work with TV audio with the analogue inputs.

For the first time in his life, the legendary Casanova (Heath Ledger) is about to meet his match when the alluring Francesca (Sienna Miller) does the one thing the notorious lover of women never thought possible - refuse him. Through disguises, subterfuges and wit, CASANOVA manages to get closer and closer to Francesca. But he's playing the most dangerous game he's ever encountered. A game that will not only risk his life and reputation , but his only chance of true love.
076532413X|3.0|I picked this book up a few weeks ago as I began watching the new TV show and thought, heck, I'll give the book a read and see how much the show messes it up. Well, boy was I surprised to find that the show is infinitely better than the book---first time I've ever experienced that. The good news is that this book introduced me to the worlds of Robert Sawyer, who I thought did a nice job with this novel and I enjoyed his writing style.  In fact, I've recently started Calculating G-d, and it's terrific!  There is at most a tenous relationship between the book and the show, so if you're looking to gain some insight into what's going to happen next on the show stay aaway from the book. If, however, you enjoy an interesting premise and terrific writing grab this novel and run.

B002C1BHIO|5.0|I currently own higher-end Panasonic HDMI cables, and these Amazon HDMI cables perform just as well.  The high-definition video quality is great and I couldn't see a difference between the two, the thickness of the Amazon HDMI cable matches the higher-end cable, and the build-quality is strong and durable.  The cable does have a stiff end so this cable does not bend as easily and is not as flexible as other cables are (in case you have your tv up against the wall, so you would need to have your tv about 6 inches away from the wall if it is on a tv stand.  It may not be a problem for most TV's that will be wall-mounted, but it depends on the position and placement of the HDMI ports on the back of your TV.      The packaging that these cables came in was great and easy. It was in a small cardboard box in another box, well protected.  Very easy to open, and safe inside. No damage at all.    I recommend these Amazon HDMI cables.  5 out of 5.
B002M3SOWO|4.0|I stumbled upon the first in the series at a local bookstore and, after quickly reading it and the rest of the series, impatiently awaited the release of this final book in the series.<br /><br />I wanted to love it since the series had been so inventive and surprising but I was disappointed.  The plot was barely present and the great majority of the book consisted of a drawn out battle with only a few \\"firework\\" moments.  The ending of the book was predictable and left the story with many loose ends.  The character development was overshadowed by a vignettes in the story that felt repetitive from the previous books.<br /><br />I am not a member of the target demographic for this book and perhaps I would have liked it more if I was a teenage boy.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|It came in excellent condition, no corners of the box bent, and came in time.
B001GKJ2FW|4.0|The movie itself is rather mediocre.  The singing in this movie is borderline atrocious with tinny voices and actors who have no ability to carry a tune.  All the best ABBA songs were performed at the first half of the movie leaving you singing along to some of the worst pop music ever sang at the latter half.  ABBA created a lot of awful music, just remember that.  Only at the very end when Meryl Streep sings atop a seaside cliff that the movie gets redeemed.  That scene was gorgeous and looked imamculate in Bluray and for top-end TVs.      The camera work and the scenes are beautiful.  I have my picture setting to two notches above normal but not 'vivid'.
0735619670|1.0|In short: \\"Code Complete\\" could give a nice, throughout overview of nearly every aspect of software engineering. But it is bloated with quotes over quotes of studies and goes too often into too much details but without really giving true background information. It's more like an oversized executive summary than a real handbook about software engineering - it lacks real substance.    If you read \\"Code Complete\\" with a keen eye, you will notice that there is virtual no first-hands experience of McConnell in it - only the mentioned quotes of studies. And it shows - it gives the naive reader the false sense of knowledge, but will leave him without a true grasp of the material.    Two examples which illustrate the systematic problems in some parts of this book: At one point a study of Xerox from 1964 is used to illustrate how much time programmers spend in meetings, how much time with coding, how much time testing, documenting and so forth. McConnell himself admits that the figures are old. But airily he states that this doesn't matter, without giving any arguments why these numbers - which are not only from the last century but 45 years old! - matter in a fast-developing business as software engineering today! At some other point, he cites \\"Peopleware\\" from DeMarco: The best programmers are 10 times faster than the worst. Sadly, in \\"Peopleware\\" are assembler programmers compared with higher language programmers... and these numbers are from 1975.    In the chapter about testing he states that testing cannot prove absence of errors. Some pages later he boasts how he tested the final version of one of his programs for weeks with over 100.000 files until he was content with its quality... so he doesn't heed his own wisdom?! And this is one of the few places in the whole book where he gives first-hand experience...    Too keep this review short, I don't go into detail with the many inaccuracies and rhetorical dodges. They are simply annoying.    From my own experience I have to say: Any software project manager giving this book to experienced programmers will getting compliance, but no commitment. Being blunt: They will scoff at the shallowness of the book, given its size. A more compact treatise would have been way better. So I consider this book a wasted chance - after all this only one star, I'm afraid.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|This DVD combo pack was amazing! The regular DVD was great but the Blu-Ray DVD was remarkable! The picture quality and sound on both DVDs were unreal. We all really enjoyed the added extras that were included, too. This was one of my favorite Disney movies growing up so it was nice to be able to share this updated version with my kids. We really enjoyed our viewing experience and are VERY grateful to have added this combo pack to our collection. Definitely a timeless classic for people of all ages!
B000ZECQ08|3.0|Warning!  Major spoilers in review!  If you haven't read the books or see the movie, don't read!<br /><br />The first two Harry Potter movies managed to sum up the contents of the books upon which they were based, but because the books themselves weren't terribly good (the series as a whole is a masterpiece, but not based on the first two books), the movies were terribly good.  There was none of the darkness, danger, and depth of the later novels.  The final three novels in the series turn the Harry Potter series from a merely good series, to what is quite probably the finest long series of books ever written for children (though adults will find them quite as good).  Unfortunately for the films, the books are simply too complex and deep to satisfactorily compress in a film.  At least that is true for THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX and THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE.  We'll see with THE DEATHLY HALLOWS.  Stretching the finale over two novels may make it more successful, but it won't help this film.<br /><br />I unfortunately made the mistake of seeing this only a few days after rereading THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE.  Had I not, perhaps I wouldn't have been so acutely aware of the tremendous compression taking place in this film.  Huge hunks of the book are eliminated, other hunks are compressed powerfully into rewritten, reimagined sequences.  There are literally hundreds of small alterations, most of them simply to save a few seconds of narrative to get the film to fit the 150 run time.  A few such moments can be forgiven, but the film comes across more as an endless succession of compressions.  Plus there were some odd additions, such as the odd attack at the Weasley's house at Christmas by the Deatheaters.  I didn't mind much seeing the actual attacks by the Deatheaters at the very beginning.  I think that actually gave a nice edge to things.  But by the end of the film I felt like the entire story in the book had been distorted and deformed by the need to force as much of the book's story as possible into a format completely insufficient to contain it.<br /><br />I didn't actively dislike the movie; I was frustrated by it.  It felt too rushed to provide anything even remotely comparable to the book.  Only the very end of the film had something of the same experience as the book, though even there significant changes were made.  For instance, in the book not even Dumbledore can disapparate from Hogwarts, but instead goes into Hogsmead with Harry to do so.  And in Dumbledore's great death scene, Harry merely hides, not even under his invisibility cloak.  And Snape discovers Harry in the tower before he kills Dumbledore, which sort of signals that Snape's role with regard to Harry is more complex than we might have supposed.  And there is no great battle inside Hogwarts.  This is important because it changes entirely the tone of things.  One of the great things in the battle was the way the other members of Dumbledore's Army come out to fight, with Hermione, Ron, and Ginny engaging in their own acts of bravery.  I could go on and on and on.<br /><br />Now, I understand as well as anyone that movies are not exact replicas of books.  But I think that film versions shouldn't gratuitously change the book without cessation unless it produces something good in its own right.  The film ended up with some good things, but not as many as it should have.  I liked a lot of individual scenes.  I enjoyed seeing the always enjoyable Jim Broadbent in his role as Slughorn, even though it was as inappropriate for the role as anyone in film (isn't it sad that Leo McKern is no longer living? could anyone have been more perfect for that role than him?).  I loved Alan Rickman, who is possibly the only thing in the movies better than the books, his Snape embodying far more depth than the endlessly one-sided Snape of the books (excepting the final novel).  And it is always great seeing Michael Gambon in anything (THE SINGING DETECTIVE still remains one of the greatesttelevision productions I've ever seen, and while Dennis Potter's amazing script is what made it so great, Gambon is what brought it to life).  I enjoyed the special effects, which were effective without calling too much attention to themselves.  And I've enjoyed watching the group of actors grow and mature in their roles.  Some of them have changed enormously over the years.  Tom Felton (Malfoy) has gotten quite tall, while Bonnie Wright (Ginny) has grown as tall as Daniel Radcliffe.  And Matthew Lewis, who started the series as one of the shorter cast members, is now one of the taller ones. I really like how the main three actors have gotten better as the films in the series have progressed.  I frankly thought Daniel Radcliffe was not very good in the first film, but I think he has become an exceptionally proficient actor.  I think all three will have good post-Harry careers of they want to.<br /><br />I think fans of the movie may or may not enjoy this.  I always enjoy entering the world of Harry Potter (I'm at this very moment about a third of the way through rereading THE DEATHLY HALLOWS and so had some enjoyment of this film.  But I also found it an enormously irritating experience.  It may be that those who have not read the books might like this more than those that have.  but at this point, has anyone not read the books?er seen, and while Dennis Potter's amazing script is what made it so great, Gambon is what brought it to life).

0307454541|4.0|Count me among those who liked this. I don't read a whole lot of crime fiction, which is maybe why I liked Larsson's book, It definitely has a slow burn to it, as the crime investigation doesn't really take off until half way through. The characters, however, are well drawn, the plot is multilayered, and the prose holds up in translation. Larsson also does a good job keeping the reader from guessing the villains. The English language title is unfortunate, as it shies away from the sociological element that clearly interested the author (as the chapter quotations further suggest).
B001JJBO74|2.0|I bought this book originally thinking that it would be more like a reference for perfumes/colognes. However, it's more like a book about known perfumes/cologne that the authors rate and critique. In my opinion when you title a book \\"Perfumes: The Guide\\" you expect it to be a guide - a reference for all the perfumery sales personnel who work at the stores, boutiques, etc, and to the perfumes lovers/collectors. I was hoping that it would be more like \\"if you like perfume A, you would also enjoy perfume B\\". This guide doesn't mention top, middle, base notes of the perfumes mentioned nor does it have pictures - so you don't even know what you are looking at. Some of the reviews by the authors I agree with, but the majority of the reviews I don't agree with. In general, I feel like this is a terrible \\"guide\\" because it is very biased and completely based off the authors' experiences with the products.  Next time a guide on perfumes/cologne is made I wish that these things are covered, especially the ingredient notes of the cologne and also pictures. Also, I don't feel like a \\"review\\" of a cologne/perfume is based on one's personal critique -  not everyone noses and personalities are alike.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Miyazaki's animated movie SPIRITED AWAY is an entertaining story about a modern day young Japanese girl who gets caught up by accident between the world of the living and the spirit world. This young girl learns how to grow up in a hurry and also learns to be able to stand up for herself.  The story includes lessons about trust friendship and using one's wit.  Some very imaginative spirits are found in this story-some from Japanese folklore. Very young children may find this story a bit too scary, but older children and adults (I'm an adult and I liked it!) should enjoy this animated feature. Lots of fun!
0375854819|5.0|Listen i dont know why people review books like this and always go out of there way and critsise it. i mean im a writer too and most of my idea's are taken from things i have admiration for.

The charecters are divese and things are very diffrent from many of the books that are in the genre that i have read.So i look forward to being able to contiue to support the series buy purchasing it.Good story telling shouldnt be constriced due to those who's imagination is so closed and limited.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|THE FALL is an excellent DVD that I think is a sleeper that more people need to see.  Awesome cosutumes and beautiful scenery from around the world.  The opening photography is superb with music from Beethoven's 7th symphony playing during this opening of the movie. An interesting story that keeps you wanting to see what will happen next.  The first time I saw this movie I new I had to purchase it from Amazon for my own. Not for young children to watch but very entertaining for young adults and adults.  I highly recommend this DVD movie.  RJP
B002L3RVCY|5.0|When I heard that they were releasing a Star Wars \\"cartoon\\" in the Movie theaters, I scoffed.  I have seen the movies dozens of times and still remember seeing the original at the drive in (!) in 1977 all summer long.  I've read all the best Star Wars books (*cough*TimothyZahn*cough*), played most of the games, have all the music on my ipod and saw Episode III at midnight.  Yea, I'm a fan.  Episode 1 and 2 didn't do it for me, but EP3 brought Lucas back into my good graces.<br /><br />Despite being a hard core fan, I refused to see a Star Wars cartoon in a movie theater.  Rubbish! I declared.  How can Star Wars be a blocky cartoon?<br /><br />That was a mistake.  When I finally got the movie on DVD, it was fantastic.  When this show came out on Cartoon Network, finally, for the first time in YEARS I had a Sci Fi show that I actually looked forward to watching each week.  Yes, its a cartoon.  Yes, I would prefer a live action show or another movie, but I know that is later and never (respectively).  Yes, it could be geared a little more toward adults (but then BattleStar Galactica was so much geared toward adults, that I couldn't watch it.  Its softcore porn wrapped in a swearfest, served with torture and gore... oh goody.  Lorne Greene is spinning in his grave...) but in the end, just about every episode of Clone Wars is memorable, with little to no filler.<br /><br />Parts of it are recycled, some of the scenes are almost stolen right from the movies, but it works, it works, it works.  And there is enough new material to overlook the recycled parts.  I like the quips, I like the new Padawan and the action scenes are fantastic.<br /><br />I don't give away 5 stars easily.  And if you're turned off at my comments about \\"BS\\" Galactica and think your shows need more porn and gore, not less, you might be turned off a bit at Clone Wars.<br /><br />After EP3, I thought I would never get a chance to invest my imagination in the Star Wars universe again, but Clone Wars proved me dead, dead wrong.<br /><br />EDIT - My review is based on having seen every episode.  Now that I've got the DVD set, I am even more impressed!  There is a 64 page book in the middle of the DVD's with concept art from the show and its very nice.  The case is not cheap, its more like a book itself.  I'm guessing that they will eventually offer a nice book shelf container for holding all the seasons when it is done.  In the words of Darth Vader: \\"Impressive, most impressive\\"iew is based on having seen every episode.  Now that I've got the DVD set, I am even more impressed!

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Pride & Prejudice: Two Movies<br /><br />Jane Austen's novel, Pride & Prejudice, is set in rural, early nineteenth century England. It centers around Elizabeth Bennet, fun-loving and analytical, the second daughter of five. Though her family lives in what today seems a mansion, and her father is a gentleman, they are considered poor in the society in which they live. Mrs. Bennet thinks of little else than having her daughters married to the finest and richest men that she contrives to know of and meet. When two such men (jovial and friendly Mr. Bingly, and distant and proud Mr. Darcy) enter the community, the Bennet household is sent into an uproar of chatter and anticipation. Pride and prejudice on both sides, however, threaten to spoil the blossoming prospects.<br /><br />One adaptation of the classic was made in 1995, by A&E and the BBC, with Colin Firth (as Mr. Darcy) and Jennifer Ehle (as Elizabeth Bennet). In this version, the photography is on a grand scale, with picturesque scenery. Many of the lines leap from the pages of the book, the story and it's messages are accurately depicted, and the acting is superb. Also not to be forgotten, is the beautiful, sometimes lively, sometimes serene, musical score, which sweeps the viewer into its mood.<br /><br />Taking a more modern approach, the 2005 adaptation (the one on this page) casts Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy, and Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Bennet. It also stars Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourg, aunt of Mr. Darcy. The photographic angles in this version were contemporary, as opposed to the traditional drawing room style of the BBC. This version takes much more liberty with the customs and propriety of the times (i.e. characters walking miles through the countryside in their nightclothes, or bursting into rooms with no announcement). All of the actors had big shoes to fill, but Knightly, Macfadyen, and Dench did a good job at casting new, and well-executed light on their characters (where the script allowed for it). Most of the other actors/characters, however, I don't think filled those shoes hardly at all. The costumes, music, and sets in this were all much shabbier than those in the 1995 version. I think this script would be difficult for a newcomer to the story to follow, especially regarding introduction of characters. Also, in trying to make the script different from other versions, the characters simply changed their minds, instead of growing and learning throughout the narrative, and the lessons of the story were lost for the most part.<br /><br />All this said, I prefer the 1995 adaptation, because: it adheres to the story and times; the music, landscape, and costumes are elegant; the acting (in my opinion) is superior.

030014332X|5.0|This is world history as \\"concept.\\" It attacks the subject in chunks of the \\"once upon a time\\" variety, just big enough to stick to the brain and such that even a young kid can understand and enjoy it. Yet, it is not for kids only, for it covers all of the major events, personalities, dynasties and wars of civilization -- as well as the prehistory of man. In an unbelievably thorough way. Hard to believe but true!<br /><br />Although it cannot serve as the \\"last word\\" on world history. As the \\"first word\\" it is an exclamation point: virtually unsurpassed in its liveliness and ability to hold the reader's attention.<br /><br />Thus it is a fun read that spins myths and legends that just happen to be true history. It is an intoxicating experience that makes the reader want to know more, which is about as much as one can ask for from one book. The sheer fun of this book makes one wonder why there are not more summary history books like this one, both for children and for adults.  It may be little in size but not in its impact on the reader, a virtual index to the beauty and magic of history. Ten stars
1401223176|3.0|Jim Lee's art in HUSH is, honestly, fantastic. He constructs scenes very cleanly and he just brings a very dynamic flavor to this arc.<br /><br />However, with the hit-or-miss Jeph Loeb at the helm, the series is ultimately very VERY disappointing. It's essentially the same marketing scheme that DC used for THE DEATH OF SUPERMAN or BATMAN: KNIGHTFALL - bring a previously unheard-of villain to really screw with Bruce Wayne/Batman. And the fact that he's wrapped in bandages the whole time makes him just that much more \\"mysterious\\" because he could be any number of former Batman villains, since his Rogue's Gallery is the most impressive of any comic character in history. And we do come across most of those characters.<br /><br />But since HUSH turns out to be someone else completely, it just smacks of being all set-up and no pay-off.<br /><br />However, The reason I give this 3 stars instead of just two is because writer Paul Dini has used the character of Hush to incredible effect in the recent issues of DETECTIVE COMICS and the new STREETS OF GOTHAM. So, the lesson here is that a lame character like Hush (or Bane for that matter) can be cool in the right writer's hands (Dini with Hush and Gail Simone, who currently uses Bane to excellent effect in her amazing series, SECRET SIX).<br /><br />Still, I recommend borrowing this from a friend, or checking it out from your local library, but other than that, save your money.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|First I love the frustration free packaging.  Both from a green perspective and just a hassle perspective this is a very important selling point for me.<br /><br />However, lets get real here.  If I spend hundreds or thousand on a component for my home I want good quality cables so that I can get the most from my system.  This component cable provides excellent value and delivers good quality video to my 55inch 1080i screen.<br /><br />By clearly labeling the color on the side of the RCA plug it is one less thing I have to figure out as I am in a dark comer of the living room.  The cable over all appears well constructed.

1594488916|4.0|A true-crime story about a man who steals rare books and another man who was determined to catch him.<br />John Gilkey, loves rare books and envy's those with enough money to collect them. So he feels perfectly justified with stealing as many as he can through various fraudulent means. Ken Sanders is a bookseller who becomes security chair of the Antiquarian Bookseller's Association of America. He discovers that there have been many thefts with similar MO's. He develops a faster mode of reporting and tracking these crimes throughout the country and becomes obsessed with catching Gilkey.<br /><br />Bartlett becomes interested in the collecting of rare books and the stories of thefts told to her by different sellers. She meets Ken Sanders and becomes fascinated by the story of Gilkey, who is currently in prison, charged with the thefts of a few of the books he stole. She goes to the prison to meet with Gilkey and interviews him many times, even after he is released. She is drawn into Gilkey's version of events, and how he takes no responsibility for his crimes, he won't even refer to  what he does as stealing. Despite his jail time he is still determined to acquire books and tells her of some of his ideas, making her wonder where she draws the line as a journalist.<br /><br />I love books about books. Reading a book about other people obsessed with books was just too irresistible. And this book did not disappoint. Besides the main story about Gilkey, she also tells of various book collectors in history and the world of rare books and booksellers.<br /><br />Though a non-fiction book, it reads quickly like a novel and sucked me right into Gilkey's world. Once I finally got started, I could not put it down. I'm just glad I can't afford to become a rare book collector, because I have a feeling I would be as obsessive as some of the people I read about. Though, I'm quite sure I would not go to the lengths Gilkey did. At least I hope not!<br /><br />This was an amazing read that I really enjoyed and strongly recommend, especially to my fellow bibliophiles.<br /><br />my rating 4/5recommend, especially to my fellow bibliophiles.    my rating 4/5
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|If you've read a number of Mr. Brown's stories (as I have) you'll notice a haunting similarity. It's the same story he's written at least four other times: a big, mysterious organization (NASA, NSA, Catholic Church [twice]) has the power and will to control the lives of The Little Guy, and someone will figure out what it all really means. Fill in the blanks. *Yawn* Pass on this one and wait for Danny to write a new story in the future.
B0006399FS|5.0|A lot of people don't like this album. They claim it's too focused. That, however, is exactly why it is such a great album, especially after the unfocused (but still great) music U2 made during the 90's. There aren't just a few standout songs and then some filler songs; every track is superb.     Vertigo starts the album with a bang. While a little too rock'n'rolley to be considered \\"classic\\" U2, it definetly works. (5/5)    Miracle Drug comes next, a prayer for a cure for someone sick. It starts out slow, but builds to Bono (or is it Edge?) saying \\"Beneath the noise, below the din, I hear your voice: it's whispering. In science and in medicine, I was a stranger you took me in...\\" before Bono comes in with the chorus. (4/5)    Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own is about Bono's Dad, who died a few years ago. Bono's singing is raw and emotional. This song could be synonomous to any father-son relationship (\\"I don't need to hear you say that if we weren't so alike, you'd like me a whole lot more,\\" and \\"It's you when I look in the mirror, it's you when I don't pick up the phone.\\") (5/5)    Love and Peace or Else follows, with Adam regining over this track. Great song, great lyrics- \\"And I wonder where is the love?\\" (5/5)    City of Blinding Lights is a U2 anthem at its best, with Edge's signature guitar chimes. (5/5)    A Man and A Woman is one of the more relaxed songs, with mostly acoustic guitar. (3/5)    Crumbs From Your Table contrasts how spoiled and well-off americans are compared to other strugglin nations (\\"Would you deny for others what you demand for yourself?\\")   (5/5)    One Step Closer is a prayer, a yearning. Bono pictures himself in different places of lonlines, (\\"across the road from hope,\\" \\"on an island in a busy intersection,\\") but is still one step closer to knowing for it.  (3/5)    Original of the Species was written for Bono's, Edge's, and Larry's daughters. The song is about enjoying every moment of life, becuase life is all too short. (\\"Theend is not as far as the stars\\")  (4/5)    Yahweh ends the album on an uplifting note, a prayer asking God to be better. Bono asks for his hands to be taught what to carry, and for his heart to break.  (5/5)    How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is as breathtaking as it's name. Before you decide you don't like, listen to it a few times.
B00139W3NE|4.0|The film that this movie is most likely / most frequently going to be compared to is [[ASIN:B00005JO1X The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Full Screen Edition)]].  This makes sense as both have talking animals and take place in a sort of fairy-tale land of imagination.  Both involve children who either are British or have British accents.<br /><br />However, if one watches both closely, the parallels soon come to a quick halt.  C.S. Lewis' story is a transparent allegory of Jesus and it tacitly exalts Christianity & Christian virtues.  COMPASS, on the other hand, pokes fun at religion in general and has obvious allusions to the Spainish Inquisition & various other nefarious abuses-of-power by religious groups.<br /><br />This, of course, is huge reason why COMPASS didn't do nearly so well at the box office as NARNIA did.  A lot of people may have mistakenly thought that they were going to get a variation on NARNIA and storyling that espouses religious doctrine.  Am sure they must have been shocked to find out that this wasn't a Christian-friendly film!<br /><br />For myself, I found this to be a unique and entertaining story.  I've always been a fan of Nicole Kidman, and I applaud her for not being afraid of the Catholic societies who would condemn her for being a part of the film (which, in fact, they did).  The incorporation of the legendary Derek Jacoby brings credibility to the cast.  Dakota Blue Richards is an outstanding child actress who performed brilliantly in a difficult role.<br /><br />So, if you're not afraid of being accused of heresy and you're looking for a compelling story, then what you just might need to do is grab a golden compass.  It will point you in the right direction!
B0013LPS7U|5.0|A great debut album from a great band. Edge is already making his mark with his signature chimes and echos of the guitar, and Larry and Adam make a tight, tap-your-foot-to-the-beat rythm section.  Bono lets himself get lost in the music in nearly every song.<br /><br />The album starts out with \\"I Will Follow,\\" an enthusiastic song about Bono's mother. Next are the more brooding \\"Twilight\\" and \\"An Cat Dubh,\\" the latter of which segues into \\"Into the Heart,\\" a beautiful song that ends slowly and quietly with Adam on bass and Edge adding a few flourishes with the guitar. Next is the upbeat \\"Out of Control,\\" then \\"Stories for Boys,\\" and the quiet and thoughtful \\"The Ocean.\\" \\"A Day Without Me\\" marks Edge and what would become his signature echo, then \\"Another Time, Another Place.\\" \\"Electric Co.\\" follows, reminiscent of \\"Out of Control,\\" and the album ends with \\"Shadows and Tall Trees,\\" a song that starts out slowly but ends with a big chorus.<br /><br />The remastered original Boy CD is great, but only avid fans should spring for the special edition, which includes a second disc of unrealeased songs and live tracks. The few unreleased songs on the second disc include early versions of tracks such as \\"Twilight,\\" \\"Stories for Boys,\\" and \\"Out of Controll,\\" which all sound better in their final versions. Other unrealeased tracks are a bit annoying, like \\"Boy-Girl.\\"
B000000WFZ|5.0|As soundtracks go, this one is not as epic or dymanic as, say, that of [[ASIN:B0001CCY7E Dances with Wolves]] or [[ASIN:B00008NGHU Children of Dune]].  What this soundtrack does boast is one of the most beautiful themes you will ever hear during your sojourn on this planet.  Played on an oboe, daring in its simplicity, it is absolutely captivating.  It expresses both sorrow and grandeur, and as such it nicely complements both the storyline as well as the breath-taking cinematography of the film.  This is by far Ennio Morricone's most popular & memorable soundtrack - and for good reason!

0060922583|5.0|If you liked the films \\"Mind Walk\\", and \\"What the Bleep...\\" and are interested in the spiritual repercussions of the latest findings in quantum physics, and Unified Field Theory then you will probably love this book too.  If you are unfamiliar with these concepts know that although not religious, this book explores some recent discoveries made by science that may have seemingly spiritual repercussions.  Talbot elegantly explains the very intriguing Holographic Theory coined by Bohm.  It's a theory that the universe, our memories, even our senses are based on the idea that fractales exist in our lives that are similar to a hologram.      A true hologram looks like a series of squiggles and lines.  You need to shine a laser through it to produce a 3-D image.  Imagine the image is of an apple.  Even if you cut the hologram into pieces, and shine a laser through, the image of the apple is visible and intact. The smaller the holographic piece, the fuzzier the image becomes, but it still creates the entire image, not a portion of it.      There are several other examples of this principal throughout the book as applied to other fractales in nature.  Similarly, if you remove 1/8 of the brain, you don't remove 1/8 of a memory, the whole memory simply becomes fuzzier, but you still remember the whole experience. A holographic image emerges from the seemingly chaotic patterns of interference in wave patterns, yet when a laser is shone through an image appears. The brain appears to be organized on the same principal of criss-cross patterns as well. One chapter provides additional examples to suggest that there are several chaotic patterns in nature that when studied closer, actually have an exceptionally high order.  This suggests a more infinite order to the universe than previously realized.  There are several examples of mathematics and quantum physics in this book that are used to explain this theory more clearly.      Despite the fact that I am more oriented toward the arts, linguistics, and biology, I found this book to clearly explain some very paradigm shifting concepts.  This is one of those pieces that I had to own so that I can refer to it throughout my life as well as reccommend to friends, because it is hard to see the world the same after considering the concepts within.

NOT so...  The enhancements done to this movie were excellent.  Snow White's beautiful voice and ruby red lips where crisp and vivid!    My kids also enjoyed the games included.

0743298039|4.0|Have you ever read a book that you knew you liked, you just weren't sure how much (like does it rank in with the best books you've ever read?)  That was this book for me.  I come across them from time to time.  This book pulled me right in, but there were parts that I didn't enjoy reading.  Why we really needed to know about Margaret beyond the fact that she was a twin was beyond me.  I didn't feel any of that really added to the story (except her research stuff).  The ending was not what I was expecting, and I wasn't exactly sure how believable it was.  And what happened to Charles?  Were did he go?  I hate loose ends!!  But, overall I enjoyed the story.  Worth the read.

0131103628|3.0|Okay so I know a little about programming already from my earlier years, I have been out of programming for many years and thought I'd pick up a \\"good book\\" on \\"C\\" to start back into it again.  I have found this book a little on the difficult side to learning the language.  Although the examples are decent, actually figuring out how to compile them and make any use of them is frustrating to say the least.  I agree with others who say this book needs a companion to learn it, mostly something that teaches you how to use a compiler such as gcc or xcode first so that you'll know what you're doing when you pick up this book.  The problem is most of those books already expect you to know what is in this book already before you learn them.  Maybe an updated version of this book will include a simple chapter on how to use the code in this book with a compiler such as I mentioned and it will be an excellent resource for beginners, otherwise I don't recommend it to such as me.
