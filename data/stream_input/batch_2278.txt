B002JPYIZ2|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies! And having it on Blu-ray is a plus. A must have for my collection.
B0052IH44K|5.0|This book is the first in a series of thirteen and is about three orphans who are left a great fortune by their parents.  Unfortunately, they must live with a count whose mind is set on taking their fortune from them.  I like this book a lot because the author is very much talking to you and makes you feel as though you are in the story.  His explanation of tricky words is also helpful.  There is a lot of suspense and sad occasions.  I would recommend this series only to people who can handle the constant sadness.  Even though I wanted to stop reading, I couldn't because it is such a great story.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Fast paced. Appreciated not over-empowering the evil doers or dragging out their actions. Strong, competent heros and heroines. Enjoyed it.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Ok, so anyone who saw the final episode and hated it obviously never really got the whole point of the series. I will not spoil it for those who haven't seen it though. Simply the best tv series ever created. Nuf said. &#34;Guys......where ARE we?&#34;
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This one was great. Every once in awhile I will buy a book for reasons that are less than clear to me. I do not really recall why I got this one - I knew nothing about it and had not read any reviews. But for some reason it looked interesting.<br /><br />I was not disappointed. In fact, I read it in two days and really enjoyed page after page after page of this very well-written and well-constructed story.<br /><br />Great book! Buy it! Read it! You will not be disappointed.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I totally enjoyed this book.  I could see my daughter doing this adventure and in all honesty, I would love to hike part of the PCT myself.  A wonderful read. I would recommend it to anyone.
B0007TKH66|5.0|Since I am star trek fan for mant years and used to record the episides when thet would come on I decided to by the first to series. I would receommend to any star trek fan.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|This movie is in great shape and I have no problems with it at all.  I have not had time to watch it though, sadly.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I find it absurd that now that the paperback has been released, I can order it and have it delivered for less than I can the Kindle edition.  I love this series, and DwD is no exception, but it is ridiculous that they are using this business model.  Encourage people to use new technologies, and save resources, don't punish them for being relatively early adopters.  I logged on tonight to buy and re-read this book before the start of season 3 on HBO just to whet the palette for what is to come... But frankly I am not dropping 14$ on a e-book which can be grabbed at the used book store for 3.  Poor move Amazon.
B003UESJHO|5.0|This movie is in great shape and I have no problems with it at all.  I have not had time to watch it though, sadly.
B009A87X80|5.0|This truly is the best of the best.  She sings with passion and originality.  And the choice of songs is superb.
B002ZG999U|5.0|This movie is in great shape and I have no problems with it at all.  I have not had time to watch it though, sadly.
B005QTGFL8|5.0|THIS is why ADTR is so popular, every piece of this album is unique and in pounds in that punky hardcore style that only they do. This is my favorite of their albums and the extra songs on the special edition are well worth it. Buy now!
B003UESJH4|5.0|This movie is in great shape and I have no problems with it at all.  I have not had time to watch it though, sadly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game love it so much fun when u have noting better to do and u are challenged to get another board or character or just save points and spend them all at once.
0375714839|4.0|This type of book is usually not my come of tea.  However, when I heard some of the schools in the Chicago area were attempting to ban the book from their reading list, I decided to see what all the fuss was about.  I discovered this book was a memoir from a woman who grew up in revolutionary Iran.  This book was obviously designed for a younger group because it is in a comic book type of format, which actually made it an enjoyable read because of the illustrations on each page.<br /><br />The Complete Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi is a 341 pages long and the story begins in 1980 when the author was 10 years old.  It tells about when the Islamic revolution took place in 1979 and how all women had to wear a veil.  The story moves on to explain the many changes that occurred in Iran while she was growing up.<br /><br />The author relates how close she was to her family and how they did their best to protect her from the changes going on in Iran over the years.  Her parents sent her to Austria to learn French and she also learned some German as well.  This is basically an autobiography of the author and I think it is a book American youths should also read in order to understand the dangers of religious extremism.  The author now lives in Paris, France and is still writing.<br /><br />In conclusion, even though I think this book will appeal to women more than men, I still think it was a good read.  If you want to find out how women (and anyone else who did not follow every rule) were treated for breaking any of the very strict religious rules in Iran, you might want to read this book.<br /><br />Rating:  4 Stars.

B009KEN87O|5.0|brings me back to the games I grew up with...space invaders..galaxian demon attack etc..it has good gameplay with auto fire and very good control for a tablet game...well done!!!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|funny a good money for rewatching and the actors were chosen with perfect addition to make the movie hiliarious. recommend it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was fabulous. It is an easy read. I really enjoyed this book because the narrator (Pat) has such a unique voice and perspective, not found in any other book I have read. The book is sad at times, but is true to life. A must read.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This combo pack was a great value. I love having the blu-rays, a set of DVDs, and the digital download. The bonus features are fantastic, and I'm very happy with the purchase.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I love science fiction books based more on science than fantasy.  This book was well written, full of technology.  Some technology I kind of question as to whether or not it is possible, but hey...it's fiction.  This book was well paced, characters were fully developed.<br /><br />There only two problems outside of the occasional typo.  The first was the cursing.  While it was in character it was a bit too much.  On occasional curse word thrown in here and there would give an adequate representation of the survivor Mark Whatney.  The other was the sudden shift from first person point of view to narrator point of view about 80% of the way through the book and then the shift back to first person.  This happened several times and was unnecessary.  Use of third person point of view would have been better and not given the impression of author intervention in the story.<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone who likes hard science in their Sci-Fi.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Keeps my grandsons busy.  I've even tried to beat their scores.<br />Everyone is happy when they are busy in the car with this.
B0053TWVBO|4.0|This is one of the great horror movie of all time.. This is a great library copy .  I am glad the I brought<br />the movie.

B00ANGICRE|5.0|Wonderful movie, Helen Hunt really push the evenlope on this movie.  It  should be a lot more movies, made like this one<br />she a good actress and  nothing was edit to much like some movie are.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|My daughter and I are addicted!  Great game...not too easy and not too hard.  Not much else ot say about it.
B0036S4CTS|4.0|I loved the fast forward of snapshots of one dy over a year, how much and how little can change in one's life.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love this because it keeps my 5 and 2 year old grandsons busy.  It's a game that is fun for any age.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie. The visual effects are amazing. I want to watch it again for the enjoyment of the visual effects!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its a good free game its bad in some areas but other then that its good.Its good but not that good.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wonderful twists and turns. Chapter endings keep you reading. Was surprised at the ending. People enjoy talking about the book as you read it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game so much and the fact that the coins regenerate with time is awesome! I highly recommend it.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I was soooo excited about this case the color was supper cute and the description gave me home that my iPhone would have a long life. In fortunately the product is cheep feeling. You can't here anyone on the phone or music being played through the speakers it makes the touch screen harder to use as well . So basically the it defeats the purpose of having an iPhone.<br /><br />The only time I use this is when I'm reading on my phone in the hot tube, even then it's not worth the money.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Must have this DVD.  This is a classic to add to your DVD collection.  I had been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and found it on Amazon.com.  I rate it &#34;Love It&#34;!
0375869026|5.0|After hearing about this book on the radio, I ordered it for myself.  I'm now reading it with my 12 year old daughter and will then read it with my six year old son.  This should be required reading for every middle schooler!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|it is a quick read, nothing great, but easy when you have three little ones running around. I know there is another book from the other perspective.
0385360169|1.0|I expected for the over $50.00 this cost, to be all 3 of the books - instead it was only volume 1 and this disappointed me.  It was not clearly stated that this was only 1 of 3 books to the set.
1616550414|5.0|the art is beautiful, the content itself is worth the price. very high quality and a must for all Zelda fans

B007SGLZP8|2.0|I have been a big Grisham fan for years, but I just couldn't get into this book.  I didn't care about the characters, and found the plot difficult to follow.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This is right in line with all the great books John Grisham has written. I am a big fan of his & have read almost all of his books. I think his writings about law are the best.

B0082SU98U|5.0|This is truly one of the beautiful classics.  Perfect for all readers.  I read it aloud to my homeschool son before he could read himself; we both enjoyed it.  So this is a wonderful read no matter the age of the reader.<br />  I read this book as a child and identified with Pollyanna and thought it was a good book.  When I read it again as a teen, it was the same.  Now at 40(ish), I enjoyed Pollyanna but found myself identifying with Aunt Polly esp. And the other adults.<br />  This is truly wonderful book!  You can't help feeling \\"glad\\" yourself when you put it down.  And feeling like you're meeting old friends when you pick it back up again.

0545265355|5.0|I live in the Netherlands and i expected the box in six weeks, but it was already there after two! That was a very nice suprise! The books are very beautiful and good-looking and the box looks really nice at my bookcase. It is really nice for every Hunger Games fan!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|We ordered the audiobook along with the Life of Pi  e-book. My eleven year old daughter listened to this in the car with her dad and I. We all loved it. We had seen the movie already but still found the audiobook extremely enjoyable.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Purchased \\"Les Miserables In Concert\\" several weeks ago from Amazon, and have watched it many times since then.  The music, singers, chorus, etc., are outstanding!  Yesterday, I received the \\"just released\\" movie version and I was really disappointed! It doesn't even come close in comparison to this winning concert performance. Definitely worth having!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game so much ! My favorite pony is Apple Jack because she is loveable and sweet and she love.'s Apple just like me.
B005S9EKCW|2.0|After ordering and watching the 25th Anniversary of \\"Les Miserables\\" from Amazon, I was very disappointed in this movie version.  I felt that more attention was paid to the acting, scenery, special effects, etc., then to the beautiful music. Russell Crowe Anne Hathaway, and the rest of the cast gave beautiful performances, but their singing voices (except for a few) did nothing to enhance the highlight of this production, the music. I've played it once, and that was enough. If you want to see and hear how the beautiful musical score from \\"Les Miserables\\", was performed live on state, get the 25th Anniversary Edition.
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|The movie is great but the file amazon uses to provide streaming to devices is not working for everyone.  Many people are getting \\"content errors\\". These errors stop the movie at the same place every time not allowing you fast fwd past the error.  I could only get 32 minutes into the film.  The customer service representative told me some customers were lucky and viewed up to 45 minutes into the film before it errored out.  She said that they will have to request a  new file from the company.  As they could not provide a time frame as to when that could happen she offered a refund.
B004XN3FHA|1.0|Had to keep shaking it to keep the light on. Returned the item. Got the Streamlight instead. Can not recommend.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Hard to get passionate about batteries.  My bathroom scale now works.  I got the batteries I needed quickly at a great price.  I recommend them.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Awesome retro gameplay. Simple but keeps me playing. Really glad this came up in the free app of the say otherwise I probably would never have played it.
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|Great movie and didn't have any glitch while watching it on my tv.<br />I was not sure whether the encoding was for 1080p! Felt more like 480-720p!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book chronicles the life of a man who was willing to do anything for his God, family, and country.  Every American who has ever questioned or honored the caliber of an American soldier should read this book.
B007STXHTM|5.0|Yes, we all know Gopro's dome lens on the standard housing sucks when it comes to picture and video quality underwater, therefore this is absolutely necessary for underwater use. It keeps the quality crystal clear, of course a few filters might be needed if you dive deep or on coral reefs. Other than that, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a Hero2. I've gotten some really nice pics thanks to this accessory, but only because I watched a hundred reviews before actually buying it. Before sliding your gopro into it and just jumping in the water, test the housing by itself without the camera in it to make sure it is air tight. I have seen some reviews where people had leaks in the housing, but I have had no such problem at all.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is an excellent story.  You can't believe the mind games the characters play. There has to be a sequel!
0307352153|5.0|What recharges you: solitude or socializing? If you answered the former, you're likely an introvert; the later, an extrovert.<br /><br />In contrast to extroverts who thrive on external stimulation (Big parties! Fast rides! The more the merrier! The busier the better!), introverts buzz from within (endless ideas. complex thinking. intense feelings. deep connections.).<br /><br />For the introvert, Susan Cain's book _Quiet_ inspires endless nods, that's me's and a-ha's; for the extrovert, it provides a glimpse into the rich inner landscape that underlies introverts' more subtle personas. The first part of the book looks at how introverts have often been misunderstood, and how cultural ideals and environments have favored extroversion. The next part of the book presents a fascinating overview of the nature/nurture effects and neurobiology of introversion: The brain wiring of introverts differs from that of extroverts--a less active dopamine pathway helps explain why introverts are less motivated and stimulated by external rewards than extroverts...while at the same time often highly sensitive to and over-stimulated by environmental cues. (No surprise why introverts love alone time!) The final part of the book shows how introverts can love, live, and thrive in a world built for extroverts.<br /><br />A validation-fest for introverts, and a guidebook for those who (try best to) love them, _Quiet_ speaks loudly to the power of introversion!
B005S9EKCW|4.0|First off, I love the music of Les Mis, I was never fortunate enough to see it professionally but I listened to the original London soundtrack growing up, which led me to be interested in the Broadway soundtrack (which is more similar to the movie than the London version is) and I've read the novel. I do think that the movie was well casted, for the singing to have been as good as a Broadway show the movie would have had to be animated so that Susan Boyle could play Fantine. Also let's be realistic here, they were obviously using star power to boost promotion of the movie.<br /><br />I actually like Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Fantine and don't think that she \\"weakened\\" the character as other's have suggested. She is dignified, then put in a desperate situation where she has to do things she finds repulsive- Hathaway's portrayal of her showed the misery in that. Amanda Seyfried made an adorable and adequate Cosette, British cutie Eddie Redmayne made a lovable and sympathetic Marius, Russell Crowe was a stern and believable Javert, Helena Bonham Carter did what she always does which worked fine for Mrs. Thénardier. The only actor I question as a good choice is the lead, Hugh Jackman (AKA Wolverine to my generation). He gets by most of his songs OK, particularly the ones in the beginning because you are excited to start watching the movie. The song \\"Suddenly\\" (sung immediately after Cosette is \\"purchased\\" and before Crow sings \\"Stars\\") added for the movie (for no reason) is terrible and creepy- singing about falling in love with a little girl while her head is on your lap and you're stroking her hair? Enough said. \\"Bring Him Home\\" (Towards the end of the film when Valjean finds out that Cosette is in love with Marius) is a huge failure by Jackman, and this is a point in the movie when you start to look at your watch and play on your smart phone.  That being said, I added the entire soundtrack to my iPod with the exception of those two songs. The movie ran a bit long- I feel that either parts should have been shortened/cut or the movie should have been longer and split into two parts (as the trend is with movies nowadays).<br /><br />I still loved the movie, but one thing really did bother me- why didn't Fantine's Angel have long pretty hair? lol, she wasn't wearing a hospital gown and she was wearing make up so we know that Angels aren't stuck looking the way they did when they died. Her appearance at the end of the film was ruined for me (I actually whispered to my friend in the theater \\"Why can't she have pretty hair in heaven?\\") haha
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I own every JT solo album and they are all great and different in their own way. This is a great cd and with only 10 songs you may be skeptical but its worth buying, trust me. It has the same give of future sex love sound so if you loved that one you will enjoy this also.<br /><br />I also heard this is part 1 of the 20/20 with 10 songs now and another 10 to be dropped later this year. Not sure how true this is but I hope its legit.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|When Netflix removes the First Season from their lineup and you have viewed twelve episodes you need to do something about the other ten episodes.  This filled the bill nicely.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a absolutely awesome app! Definitely a amazing  app! And at a great price, free! It is realistic and you have a lot of choices! Definitely recommend this app... to the world!!!
B005JZBP8W|5.0|This was a surprise present for my niece who really wanted to watch the film while recouperating from a broken ankle.  So as a 'get well' gift, it was wonderful.  Price was right, shipping speed fantastic-Kudo's to UPS deliverer who walked up 3 flights of stairs to deliver the package to her door ( and that was without knowing she was on crutches!).<br />I think she's watched it twice already.  The movie is a good one and the service was also.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Good retro game with easy control on my EVO 4G LTE, and few permissions. If it looks fun to you, you'll like it.
B009CO0SI4|4.0|Beth continues to intrigue with Sugaring Season. Her voice is best at its most fragile, especially on the closer Mystery. Something More Beautiful is hypnotic and despairing and bursts in its chorus to a fully orchestrated climax and quickly retreats, just flashes of power here.  Call Me the Breeze is as cheerful as Beth attempts here, while Poison Tree is as vicious as she attempts, but like Orton, these qualities are not obviously on display. She is so detailed and executes each song so thoroughly that it has the opposite effect of making it all sound effortless.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I rarely play games on my phone. I get bored pretty quickly. This game has been fun for days. It's worth the download.
B00701QV8W|3.0|I recently re-purchased the above two JA CD's, which had disappeared probably over 35 years ago. Both were just as good now, as when I first heard them in the late 1960's. I remembered I never really liked \\"Volunteers\\" when first hearing it, again around 43 years ago! But, for a few $, figured I'd try it out after all this time. A real disappointment, and as often happens, my early thoughts still held decades later!. Not even close to the above two!  Loud, and freakyish, too political, with none of the sublimity that this band had earlier. Harmonies, arrangements, vocals, guitars,et al. just too loud and freaky! Though it has its moments, do not buy until you have the first two. And the 4 live add-ons are almost unlistenable, especially \\"Somebody to Love\\". Maybe they were wild and crazy live, and fun even, but listening to now, just does not fly now , except as a means to induce a headache!
B005IQZB14|3.0|I'm giving Wild three stars because I think Cheryl Strayed is a decent storyteller with the potential to be a great storyteller. I thought many parts of the book were moving and read eagerly through the first half. I can't give it more because she chose to tell a fact-based metamorphosis story and ended it, after many gaps and much glossing over of events, without letting us in on any meaningful transformation. The fact that she eventually remarried years later tells us nothing about how the hike transformed her. At most, her inclusion of this postscript tells us that she believes it is evidence she is transformed.<br /><br />Many people who reviewed the book commented on the author's self absorption and impulsivity. I agree both were irritating, particularly in the second half of the book, where I had expected to see signs of growth. I felt like Cheryl Strayed not only created most of her own problems back in 1995, but also got in her own way in 2012 by refusing to be completely honest where it would have counted (e.g. by admitting that she didn't just break her own heart with her infidelity, but her husband's too, or that she didn't so much stop using heroin as swap this obsession for different ones--hiking, sex, Snapple, and very likely some other things that didn't make it into the book). In the end, I felt more like I had read a story about addiction than a story about redemption or healing or even hiking the PCT.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Just like the old days. I remember when we first got the Atari system. It was the the first week it came out. Space Invaders was awesome, so is this game. Very cool remake. I love it. Thank you for making it and offering it as the free app of the day.
0143119680|5.0|I will admit, I went into this book not knowing what to expect based on the variety of Amazon reviews. This was another book that I borrowed from my mom and I couldn't put it down. Anne Rice's The Witching Hour has long been one of my favorite novels. Both because it is so long I can get lost in it, and because I find the history parts of it fascinating. ADoW had many of the same characteristics. Not only are we able to get inside of Diana's head and learn more about who she is, but over time (and the sequel) this becomes true of Matthew too. I read this and the sequel in less than a week's time, and am now eagerly awaiting the final installment.
B00136LS2E|1.0|I downloaded this album thinking that it was the actual soundtrack for the movie, an epic collection of 1960's era music, but it was NOT what I thought it was.  This album is comprised of instrumental musical scores from the movie--no vocals.  If you are looking for Creedence Clearwater or some of the other awesome genre classics from the movie, this is NOT the album for you.<br /><br />I wish I'd know this before I purchased and downloaded the album.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is by no means a rushed product.  It was made with the same time, care, and love as the show it is based off of.  Five stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addicting and fun to play<br /> Very challenging and funny  and enjoyable fun for everyone even my son loves it and can't stop playing it
1451695195|5.0|I recommend this book to all people who are seeking  proof of what is promised in the Scriptures. Atheist and non-believers should realize that God is a keeper of His promises and He is not a man that He should lie. Thank you for your faithful witness, Dr. Alexander!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Ugh I hate it its confusing u should buy the real minecraft it should be free this game<br />  Fyi angry birds is awesome buy that 1<br />:)
B000KI6286|3.0|I am a teacher of U.S. govt. and I showed some clips to my class when we were covering the role of interest groups and lobbyists.  There are some good scenes about the using the art of rhetoric to frame issues in ways that capture the interest of citizens.  Unfortunately, there are no scenes of the main character, lobbyist Nick Naylor, actually meeting with elected officials one- on- one.  The film is a very critical depiction of lobbying and lobbyists.  Viewers need to be skeptical.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I love this movie it isn't prefect but if you go into it like i did thinking of it as the first act it makes the excpeince a magical one nothing against frodo but Bilbo Baggins has a lot more spirit.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Have to read this book. It is the best book ever. It has lots of action and adventure. U have to BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Wow everything was just wow. The entire adventure and the story and the plot all just merging into one . O my gosh
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The combination of raw and tender emotions make this book a masterpiece depiction of the struggles of doomed teenagers. Green' s frank writing style created what can easily be called on of the greatest literary works I have ever read.
B000YABYLA|5.0|The cast was incredible and the story - at times funny - at times unsettling was very believable.  Ellen shone once again.
1574214276|5.0|Great tangles, easy, fun and simple.  Can get you started right away.  Would like a bit more complex ones maybe in the back of the book, but overall 5 stars!!
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is a great movie with a lot of twists and turns.  I enjoyed it like I have all the others!  I have them all on DVD and most of the older ones on VHS, including &#34;Never Say Never Again&#34;.  Granted, Daniel Craig is a &#34;different&#34; Bond than all the others, he is still Bond.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Well written. It's a shame it's so short.  I really enjoy watching Maggie Smith in everything that she is in.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I play this g&aacute;me everyday it is so awesome eating and evolving I am trying to get the great white shark
B009FZFONO|5.0|this show is so awesome.. After watching it at night i go to bed and worry when the day comes when i wake up to  my wife trying to eat my face off.  :)
B004LM72ZY|5.0|My son loves this toy! He has not put it down except to go to bed since it arrived! He is 2 1/2 years old and it is age appropriate.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|This book was so great and I am so glad I read it. It taught me a lot and had humorous pieces, ironic things, and so much a teenager could relate to. I recommend this to females ages 12 and up to males ages 18 and up. Ann Frank is such a prodigy the way she writes and has loads of personality. Read this book and you will not regret it!
B002VKE1K2|5.0|As probably almost everybody knows, this is a \\"found footage\\" film, about two young people who decide to document on tape their life in a supposedly haunted house. And I must say that I liked it a lot.<br /><br />This film was made on a microscopic budget of 15.000 (yes, fifteen thousand) USD. Everything occurs inside just one house and its garden. There are only three actors, all totally unknown to me (and the third one appears only briefly). The soundtrack is for all practical purposes absent - and that actually is a good thing, as the mixture of silence and some white noise is in itself pretty creepy. Lights are mostly toned down (and a good thing too!) and the decorations are just those of a regular house. And yet, it ultimately made 300 million USD worldwide - and frankly, once you see it, you will understand why.<br /><br />I am absolutely not saying anything about the plot, on purpose. Just be prepared to a long, very long and slow, very slow beginning - for those who do not like this kind of things, it is better to abstain from watching \\"Paranormal Activity\\". This beginning is however necessary, because the whole idea behind this movie was a long and slow escalation, a little like in Ravel's \\"Bolero\\". Another image I had in mind when watching \\"Paranormal Activity\\" was that of a lion slowly stalking its prey - it walks all the time very slowly but once it has got near enough, every next small step greatly diminishes prey's chances to survive - until the inevitable final leap, very brief but absolutely deadly...<br /><br />Depending on your mood and on your personal taste, this is a film as easy to love as it is to hate. I personally loved it and my wife liked it too - albeit towards the end she tended to cover her face more and more with the blanket, until only one (wide open) eye was left to make peek-a-BOO...))) May be the best thing is just to watch it and make your own mind. Enjoy!
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Like many others here we ordered the movie last night. Watched around an hour. Just went to watch the rest and the movie is gone. This was a 48 hour rental and we still had 24 hours left. Very disappointing. We better not have to jump through hoops to get a refund. Probably the last time we use Amazon Video-On-Demand.
1455599670|5.0|I love all of Nicholas Sparks' books.  I read and realized that this actually happens to so many women.  I would recommend it to any one who has ever read any of Sparks' books and any one loves a good love story.
B009KEN87O|4.0|This is a very good game and takes me back to the 80's only better.  The graphics are very retro or someone is just really cheap and didn't want to do a high level graphic spectacular.  Either way a very fun and entertaining waste of time.
0345525558|5.0|I am always looking for a really good book that I can't put down.  A good book that makes me love the characters enough that when I am done ready the book I know I will miss them.  This book did just that.  Not only was the story of Victoria captivating but I had never realized the meaning of flowers before.  I recomend that you order the companion to the book which is A Victorian Flower Dictionary.  You will not be disappointed.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|There come a time in every persons life where a film stays with you and I mean deep in and as if it is part of you and will be forever. For me that Film is Suspiria. This is not just a film or dare I say movie but It's a piece of motion art at It's finest. I will give in no plots or spoilers as that's been done time and time again. I prize myself at calling it my Favorite film of all time and It was a treat to see The glorious Jean Bennett aka Elizabeth Stoddard from Dark Shadows in all her glory as Madame Blanc. I highly advise this film be watched again and again.
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|I have seen Les Mis in the theater and also anniversary productions on PBS. Both put this movie to shame.  Of course live theater was the best, but this attempt to reproduce the live experience in a natural setting left me sick after I was so looking forward to seeing it. The filth of the time period and setting was so disgustingly OVER done.  Forcing the actors to act and sing live must have been especially hard for them to do, and it shows.<br /><br />  How can you make Hugh Jackman and other stars look so ordinary even when cleaned up and are presented at their best in parts of this movie? That was also accomplished.<br /><br />  I can't say enough how much I hated this movie and I only made it to the middle of &#34;Master of the House&#34; scene, which vaguely resembled the real song in tempo. I was distracted by the urge to run to the bathroom and hurl when a rat and a live cat's tail were added to ground meat to serve the guests at the inn.  I decided it was not worth watching further, and put the disc in it's jacket where it will stay until some other poor soul decides to watch it after paying $2 from the charity bin.<br /><br />  :(((
1616550414|5.0|if you love zelda then there will be nothing you do not enjoy from this. I loved it, all of it.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|We watched this twice it was so much fun (and no kids in sight!), voiced by Sandler and other talented actors. Will definitely rent again or purchase for Halloween!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I hated all the Daniel Craig's James Bond movies as I feel they are cheesy. I actually liked this one.
B000JQU1VS|3.0|It was a story that I wanted to reread from my past.  I enjoyed the mystery of the story line.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|Advertisements frequently interrupt the game, so much so that they can actually interfere with certain aspects of gameplay.  Would have been great otherwise, but I can't play this with the ads constantly getting in the way.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|We purchased the DVD because My Fair Lady is a trip down memory lane for my wife and I. The show came out not too long after we were married .Amazon were great and delivered as and when they said they would. Thanks!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I expected it to be more of an spirital experience. It was really childish, riding on a huge butterfly etc. Most of the book<br />goes into so much detail as to his education, family history and his degrees etc. Not much was left to describe the<br />experience he had with near death, and even at that he describes such things as coldness and a pounding in his head.<br />I think this was merely background noises from the machines he was hooked up to. The part about how he felt like he<br />was in the cold ground with the earthworms seems to me to be just life supporting cords around his bed. The lights he<br />talks about just didn't seem like a spiritual journey to me at all. I was not impressed. God did bring him out of the coma,<br />to show us the miracle of his presence as he is here with us everyday, just ask him to stay with you and he will.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Learned a lot about WWII.  Accurate history of all countries involved plus love stories and behavior inherent to humankind.  Looking fwd to Book Three.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is very good and awesome I play it every day I love it the it is very cool
B0084IHVC0|5.0|Movie was in excellent condition, with no scratches and it plays well on any dvd/bluray player.  Very pleased with this one.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great DVD, best story/plot of all the modern bonds IMO. Video quality and sound excellent. Worst part was when the DB5 got it........
B0049GYXDQ|3.0|The dvd played perfectly until my daugher broke it trying to get it out of the case :S.  The blu ray will not play on my blu ray player...but I can't decide if its the disc or my player...
0805080120|5.0|This book is one of the most exciting books I've read in a long time. I almost couldn't wait for an explanation on how something as complex as the verb endings in some languages could arise naturally. The fact that I knew nothing about it beforehand contributed to keeping the suspense, of course, but the book is written for laymen, so I think most people who actually read this book will feel the same. It was so satisfying to finally understand how the verb endings and other complex structures (like case endings in latin) could have arisen. The author also has an interresting chapter on how the structure in semitic languages could have arisen, with their pure consonant roots (like s-l-m, the root behind islam, muslim, salam and many other words). This chapter is more speculative than the rest of the book (the author admits as much), but it seems entirely plausible, and the author works at a department for near eastern languages, so I would think he knows something about semitic languages.<br /><br />The book is also well-written, and at times quite funny (at one point even hilariously so). It has certainly given me a taste for more, and I will definitely read \\"Through the Language Glass\\", another book by the author.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Factory sealed upon arrival and still cheaper than at walmart.  This was a great buy, I'm glad I waited and bought online.
B00AOB3FES|5.0|What a sweet, wholesome, uplifting movie of pure love.  My wife and I ordered in food on Valentine's Day and sat and watched this movie.  No violence, no sex, no language or political agenda, just a great story.
B004G6009U|5.0|This was one of the first movies I ordered and I was weary of its conditon.  Upon arrival, I was pleased to see both case and disc in excellent condition.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book is obsessive and disturbing. It had This sweet and sour taste. There is sick love and some parts you don't understand the vicious cycle yet you want to read it all. To devour it and to know who the killer is. My favorite part is the end because its different.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|This disc was is great condition when I got it and plays without interruption.  It was scratch free and even the case was in perfect condition.
B008NW67E0|4.0|The music is very energetic but easy to listen.<br />Some songs, however, start to sound the same but I really like the ballads.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Brave came factory sealed and was in perfect conditon.  I spent atleast half of what it would have cost at walmart for the same packaged product.  I love it.
1598875329|4.0|I haven't listened to it because it was purchased as a gift but I can't imagine NOT liking Jonathan's reading of this classic.
B005S9ELM6|2.0|SOME SPOILERS - may want to read after viewing film.<br /><br />Although the film is well crafted I think it does a disservice to the public understanding of the event that is the foundation of the movie. The movie is largely fiction. Jimmy Carter has said that the Canadians did 90% of the work and took 90% of the risk and he also said that he was disappointed in the movie for misrepresenting the major role of the Canadians. Too many people (especially young people) are taking this movie as a history lesson.  Some examples of rewritten history include -<br /><br />The airport sequences and the visit to the bazaar are total fiction.<br /><br />The passports were prepared by the Canadians after receiving special authorization from a secret meeting of the Canadian Parliament.  They were delivered by diplomatic pouch, not by Mendez.<br /><br />The visas Mendez brought were badly prepared by the CIA and were corrected by the Canadians in Iran.  The mission would have failed had the corrections not been made.<br /><br />The fake movie \\"Argo\\" was not a major factor in the mission outcome.<br /><br />The airline tickets were purchased by the Canadians and there was no retraction of approval for the mission as portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about the movie is that it inspired me to investigate what really happened.  I now know more than before viewing the film - so in a sense it was a positive experience.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Just like the real 'sticky notes' only on my phone!<br />I can make the 'list' as long as I want and I haven't found a limit yet as to the number of notes that I make.<br />I usually keep some 'regular' ones & just change what's on the list (ie. different stores that I shop regularly).
B000005S2Y|4.0|Exactly what I was looking for .. my old LP is just too noisy in the &#34;good parts&#34;.  It's great to finally listen to this with no record noise
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very easy to understand & easy to change settings, etc.<br />Can not think of any reason not to like it.
0810989956|5.0|My 7 year old son is very into the whole Wimpy kid series.  He saw an advertisement for this book in one of the Wimpy Kid books he was reading and wanted a \\"diary\\" of his own.  He loves writing in this book.  There are silly questions to answer which makes it fun him!  I'm thrilled because my second grader is practicing his writing all day long without realizing it!  This whole series has been a big help with his reading scores and writing.  Great book if your child loves Wimpy Kid and needs a little push with practicing his/her writing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Thank you John green. Your book made me feel. And it feels wonderful. Though I would like to know what happens to Hazel Grace and others.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|Very happy with this movie its a classic for my family and I our Grandfather was a pilot so this movie has great meaning to all of us!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I am drawn into the game. It is like i just have to get 2 stars or more. While trying to be a woman of my word and make it within if not beforethe 80 days.youwillabsolutely love this game.
B000ORFS5G|5.0|This record was a birthday gift to someone who grew up post turntable/records.  Best choice ever and he has converted.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I love this game, reminds me old days. What I don't like Amazons. T W E N T Y W O R D M I N I M U M P O L I C Y.
B000068CNX|4.0|It was a gift for my son and I have not heard any complaints.  He would let me know.  It was in good condition, I believe I got him a new one.
0783225547|5.0|I may have seen this a bunch of time, and know most of the lines, but I knew this had to be in my collection.  I guess I am a real collector of some things.  I just really love the volcano blowing up!  Cool effects.
B009X01FJS|5.0|This case was exactly what I wanted in a case. I ordered one before this one, but returned it because it didn't have the &#34;rotate&#34; function that this one has.  I love the three different angles of steepness you can move the kindle to, and having the stand up portrait option is wonderful.  So glad I found it!
B0083SBMBM|1.0|Unfortunately, this product would not play in two major areas.  The good news is that the company is willing to take it back for a full refund.  The bad news is that I have to pay the return shipping costs.  So I spent money for a DVD that won't play correctly.
B00A6SZS2Q|2.0|While the music might be well produced & yes it is not a sloppy sound but rather polished. That is why they got two stars....I can not really tell you much except that...this is for people who like Stained-Tool...and all the other numerous radio play friendly bands that Black Veil Brides trys to sound like....ahmmm copied.<br /> There is nothing that grabs me about this CD....the style the voice...it has all been done to death. Now the same can be said about what I like...I hate the grumbling all the time in music so they get a star for singing and for production. Other than that this is yet another CD that will be tossed aside and never given a second listen.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Spirits of the western sky was so beautiful! it is now my #1 favorite album.<br />It is well written, the words and music are from the heart. I would recomend this to anyone and everyone!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is very challenging for all ages. Once you start playing you can not stop ~ very addicting!<br />The only thing that I would love to see is an explanation of each power so that we can use them the<br />correct way. I recommend Angry Birds Rio (Ad-Free)!
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is awesome. It combines the fun of two of my favorite Atari games, Space Invaders and Asteroids, plus it can go 3D and change perspective. Hopefully the score won't flip back to zero on you once you top 1 million. :)
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It's a great app it really helped me to wake up in the morning's it woke me up at work and home at night when I need to take my medicine
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The coveted Blu Ray collection for me. Having all four movies on Blu Ray is great.<br /><br />Watching Raiders of the Lost Ark, the color correction on it almost made it feel like I was watching the movie for the first time.  There were so many small details I missed the previous (many) times I've seen this film in theater, broadcast television, vhs, and dvd.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is the extras.  I want more.  I know there's a lot more extras out there (The original PBS broadcast of 'Making of' is missing for one) but other than that, there's still lots of extras with scenes I've never seen before, such as the deleted scene of Harrison holding onto the submarine's periscope) Don't get me wrong, I loved all the extras offered...I'm just being greedy.
0937381888|5.0|great book, must have for beginner who is serious about moving forward from basic brewing kits into all grain brewing.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is simply the best keyboard application for Android. Includes a great<br />library for predicting words that are accurate to the context of a sentence.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|The sounds are so nasty not to think negative but every thing you do to there hair it sound like there horney
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome I loved it on the computer, now this, just awesome. I loved the way you could mine on survival, and I also love using creative to.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Once you plug in a RJ-45 cable, it works. And it also looks aesthetically pleasing as well. BOOM!! 5 stars.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I didn't watch the show when it aired, I watched all three seasons on DVD. Then I watched them again. This is a witty, charming, fun and completely entertaining series. The stories are smart and a lot of fun to watch. I definitely recommend this show and the following 2 season. Wish it would have lasted longer.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game is addicting but also frustrating. I have been stuck on same puzzle for weeks trying to get to next level with no success variety would be nice .using want to restart all over again

B000NYT1M6|5.0|This product is well made with great detail.  It is hard to find a comparable truck of this size, having this detail.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|You have to read this. It was an interesting and exciting read. I would encourage others to check it out if they really love Sherlock Holmes.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I would give 5 stars, but I really dislike the fact u don't know how much it ever is to upgrade homes, trucks, ect.
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|What a disappointment. I've seen Phantom in both London and NY and many times on the TV. Yes, I'm a passionate fan. And Weber is my favorite composer. Well, to say I was disappointed is a gross understatement. Most certainly a grave waste of time and a mistake for all lovers of Phantom. Don't taint your memories.
B0051BNRTO|2.0|Nick Hornby's Juliet, Naked was a movie it would go straight to video.  As a Hornby fan it pains me to say this; but he has written a kitsch romantic comedy of a novel that is neither romantic nor funny (of which he can be both).<br /><br />The fundamental downfall of the novel is the implausible invented character of singer song writer Tucker Crowe.  At first Crowe is a plot devise for two main characters.  Annie has been dragged into her longtime boyfriend Duncan's twenty plus year obsession with the somewhat obscure Tucker Crowe album \\"Juliet\\".  When Crowe unexpectantly releases a comeback album (Juliet, Naked) it splits the couple up, and by happenstance leads Annie into a relationship with - the object of her ex's affection - the reclusive Tucker Crowe.<br /><br />For some reason Nick Hornby packed the novel with a large Tucker Crowe backstory of past relationships that hang as loose ends even to the end.  Crowe is portrayed as a genius with human failings.  But none of his failings seem plausible or derivative of a tormented genius.  Instead his womanizing and alcoholism seem to be lightly tacked on, as a plot device to give him room to be likeable and ultimately redemptive.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Fascinating novel about early twentyeth century. The fall of czar Nicholas, WWI, the defeat of Germany and postwar changed world are presented in a very entertaining narrative. Worth the time.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|This game is so much fun but it feasts my score almost everytime I log out it makes me mad I mean ive been pretty far and it resets.<br /><br />Other than that awesome game:)
B008XKT9FG|4.0|I had not seen this Oscar Wilde play before and enjoyed it very much. There are some plot twists but it ends with everyone right where they should be.  It's a period piece and if you are not a fan of Wilde's work,  you probably won't enjoy this.  The acting was good - except for Helen Hunt.  She spoke her lines in an almost sing-song manner that bugged me.
B000F8O35U|2.0|Was totally going to send this movie back but after a little TLC it played. It's still finicky but plays nonetheless. Just gotta mess around with it. Other than that , my daughter wants to watch it every night. And I do mean every night!
B005ES1232|5.0|I was looking for something that I could easily slip on/off to take my dogs outside. I also wanted something the could be completely washed off with a hose. I bought these without ever trying crocs. I was surprised that they were also comfortable. I was not expecting that. I have foot problems and usually these types of slip-ons hurt after a while. These do not bother my feet at all. Now my wife wants some too.
B001HYY35G|5.0|After seeing Justice 3 times in the past year I felt a need to own a performance and what better way than a live CD/DVD
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|If you like Justin's previous two albums(and I do very much).....beware before jumping to buy this one.  I knew something was wrong when the shortest song is like 7.5 minutes long....hmmmm?  I loaded the CD to my iPod, and ended up deleting all the songs before end of day.  There is no 'catchy' course that stays in your head(I'm bringing sexyback), no 'hook' that grabs your attention(Like I Love You), no 'beat' that you want to dance to(LoveStoned).  There wasn't a single song that I even thought was worth finishing.  It's not that the songs are 'that bad', they are just not good, especially when your name is Timberlake and you have half of the music world willingly available as writers/producers/guest stars.<br /><br />Don't make the same mistake, listen to the MP3 samples before buying.
B00005S6K8|5.0|You can't go wrong with Harrison Ford and the movie was a heartwarming interesting and enjoyable.  All the ingredients I love.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Excelente juego, muy divertido, entretenido y variado. Es adictivo y desestresante 100% se lo recomiendo a personas de cualquier edad
B0045HCJFS|5.0|I have seen it before and it is enough to keep me interested but not too violent or suggestive for my tastes.
B0000AFX64|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family. No swearing or blood and guts. Just a clean family show.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I choose this rating because this is a beautiful movie.  Wonderful scenery, music , and human interest that it is one I watch over and over.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|What's not to like I press 2+2 and it tells me 4! functional and large it works like it is supposed to.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|I liked this movie because it simplifies what the ones who work for the safety of this country live with.  The memories the heartaches and challenges facing those who serve in the capacity.
0802473156|5.0|This is an easy to read, very realistc, no fluff book. It helps mend bad relationships and better good ones.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|I choose this rating because I didn,t really feel the character was authentic.<br />Too far out for my tastes.<br />I loved the original with Richard Chamberlain.
1400069289|5.0|Several valid points and well written. It has good flow, a page turner. I have never considered habits are for life.
0783225733|5.0|To see the part of history that you were aware of makes it even more enjoyable.  Houston we have a problem  is a statement that I think of several times during the course of my life.  We can overcome these and it was great acting etc..
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Ok, so Game of Thrones is a great show and my comment is validated by the books' success and the shows rabid fan base.  The atmosphere is tense, yet invigorating, the characters' actions are harsh, yet they justify (in their own minds) these actions, and the scenery is so aesthetically pleasing no matter where the story takes us in Westeros.  I HIGHLY recommend this series to anyone.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I was so excited when I got it in the mail! One DVD contains the movie and the other the special features, which I have not watche yet. It's the Hobbit, what's not to love!
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|Grandboys love this movie and now that they can watch it on their Kindle Fire that makes it even better.
B006OAB432|5.0|I love it so far! It's my first vinyl album that I own. A lot of time obviously went into the cover design and sleeves for the record. A great buy.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|My grandsons love this movie.  They love the fact that they can watch it on their Kindle Fire where ever they are.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This has been a good cover for protecting the Kindle and as we travel a great deal it certainly takes a beating
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Having read all the books upon which this series is based, I have enjoyed to note the changes made for the screen version but ultimately delivered on the promise just as has the book.<br /><br />A few characters were underwhelming in terms of the book descriptions such as &#34;the mountain&#34;; his debut in the first series was imposing but in this one not so. Brienne delivered a stellar performance though I did quite think she matches the description. The scenes beyond the wall were okay but did not like the encounter between John Snow and the venerable Quoran half hand. The changes for the scene in Qarth was also underwhelming.<br /><br />In all, these are just cosmetic shortfalls in an otherwise very good screen adaptation of a book
B00AESN8XY|3.0|This game is amazing. It truly is a magnificent time wasting game. The only problem that I have found is the gimmicky crap that should be unlocked when you buy it. I spend the measly .99 cents thinking that once I bought the game that it unlocked it. Well the only thing different is that there are no longer ads to be annoyed by. I thought when i spent the money that the other disease types would be available for me to choose. THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE EVEN WHEN YOU BUY IT! So beware. If you are spending the 99 cents like I did to unlock the other gene types or virus types DON'T BOTHER because you still have to pay IN-GAME to unlock them. And its .99 cents per type. So if you want all 7 then it's going to cost you an addition 7 dollars. That to me is WRONG! If I spend the money regardless of the amount, I should be allowed to get the game in full and not have to pay additional money for something I already paid for. This to me is morally wrong on so many levels. They take your money with the false illusion that you will unlock the game, but that is so far from it. If you are buying the game to unlock it, save your money and buy a game that actually unlocks what it promises to unlock. This was a WASTE of .99 CENTS!
0375869026|4.0|The book is poorly written!!  I plan on giving this book to my 12 year old granddaughter who will probably enjoy reading it.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Searching for Sugar Man is an incredible story and we found it very enjoyable to watch. This documentary is a winner.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|great movie, should have gotten more recognition at the Academy Awards ceremony.  Love Denzel Washington.  Will have difficulty flying again.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|This is a very good app and works very well. Thank you for offering it.  It is well worth the price and download.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|These headphones are absolutely fantastic. There's really not that much I can say about them that hasn't already been said. Maybe it's just me but I don't get the same super high, highs that some people talk about. I plan on recabling these and attaching some velour pads to really complete the setup. There is a wealth of knowledge on these headphones and they've often been called \\"giant killers.\\" Now I know why....
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is very very fun! If you like blood and guts this is the place to be. You can go up on the beaches and eat people!! You can also find cool treasures on the deep ocean floor. There are many sharks to chose from each on better than the last. You start off with a reef shark then to a mako next a tiger shark then a hammerhead and last but not least a great white!!!!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I use to play space invaders at the arcade when I was a kid this is almost the same. I love it.
006074748X|5.0|This was a great book, I enjoyed it. If you like books about horses, who done it's, and foreign places then you'll really like this one. It's really interesting  and catches your interest fairly fast.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Challenging without being frustrating. I actually WANTED to clear a level if i failed. Played it until my battery died!  Great job devs!
1400069289|5.0|I read this book about 6 months ago on my Kindle and tried to implement some of the described methods. In the 6 months I have had numerous \\"small wins\\" by letting go of a few bad habits and acquiring some others. With the confidence from these small wins, I have also taken larger positive initiatives. I will find out in the long term if I am able to sustain it.<br /><br />Overall this book is very readable. I liked that it articulates well the science and bio chemistry behind habits. It also made me aware of the great portions of our lives that are simple automated routines. An intelligent analysis of these routines can help us be more successful.<br /><br />Note that for eliminating bad habits and adopting good ones, reading a book is not the panacea. Rather its is just a starting point. Constant practice reinforcements will be needed along the difficult journey. This book provides a good framework for reinforcements.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I enjoyed the first one. The second has new variations that changes the demention of the puzzles. Plenty of solutions, but only one can gain you a perfect score.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|What can I say?  I love Cary Grant and anything he has done but his show is one of his and Hitchcock's best.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I don't use it for professional emails, but it's ok.<br />The spam filter is ok, but a lot of spammers guess at your yahoo email at get it right.<br /><br />Communicator is a problem and Yahoo's headlines and &#34;news&#34; has been a failure.  The Yahoo writers are horrid.
1616550414|5.0|Its a must own product for any true Zelda fan. The book includes a lot of cool artwork and its great reading about the series.
B009KEN87O|5.0|addictive game very easy to pick up and Control is very straight forward well worth five stars I would certainly. recommend
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Heard it was a Best Seller - should have looked into the content first, but didn't!<br /><br />Wrong choice for me and I stopped reading it when I found the content nothing but sexual...  I felt that the author had no real story to tell and sold this &#34;trash&#34; only to make money.
0446580848|2.0|I've enjoyed Nelson DeMille's books for years, going way back to &#34;Plum Island&#34; and &#34;Charm School&#34; but it's going to take some strong recommendations here to get me to spend my money on another book of his any time soon.  I absolutely detest John Cory now.  I found nothing about him in this story to make me care whether he gets back to New York or ends up in a slime bag in Yemen.<br />Please tell me this is not going to be a movie.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|His sound is different than his previous CDs, but in a good way. I enjoy his new sound. It's a mix of pop and R&B. Very relaxing yet hip. The songs are long but you don't notice because they aren't super repetitive. The music flows from one song to the next. Surprisingly, Suit & Tie, his first single from the album is my leat favorite song on this album lol! I heard that song on the radio and would have never purchased this album until I heard a free stream of the album on iTunes. My favorite songs are Tunnel Vision and Don't Hold the Wall. My fiancé says Timberlake and Timbaland go together like peanut butter and jelly and I think he explained it just right!
141659521X|5.0|This might be Rapp's swan song but if it is, Vince Flynn has done a wonderful job of making us care about him and his team of good guys.  I look forward to more of Flynn's stories.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Just love anything Josh Groban sings.  This CD is just beautiful.  I listen to it over and over and never tire of it
B007M45PMU|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase and grateful to the person who recommended it to me.<br /><br />Creative.<br /><br />Imperfect.<br /><br />Real.<br /><br />Just the way I like my music!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This CD is a classic. Listen to songs all the way through! The breakdown at the end is extra special :)
B007QXU0ZO|1.0|Terrible CD that should not be sold to general public.  I listened to it one time and then parked it ...... forever.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it is a good game fun and addicting! love the zip line feature and the cool other stuff they added
B00AG473GE|5.0|I Love Duckie and Molly!!! I love the 80's. Watch it, love it. It felt like I was back to my 80's childhood. So long ago....
B004TMPJP6|4.0|Nice and easy to use. Once you start it up it gives a little info and then your off. :)
B00BNNJHXO|5.0|It's a rare band that can keep me interested for one album, let alone two. Soilwork has achieved that in this amazing double album. A truly progressive side to the standard Soilwork melodic death metal/metalcore sound emerges here, as each track touches on many new and different aspects, yet still retains much of what made Soilwork so great earlier in their history. The musicianship here is spot on, and the singing is as good or better than anything Soilwork has done before. There is little filler here, even with the album being almost an hour and a half long, you never feel bogged down.<br /><br />Recommended tracks- The Windswept Mercy, Long Live The Misanthrope, Spectrum Of Eternity, Vesta, Rise Above The Sentiment.
B009KEN87O|5.0|i really love this game. it is totally worth it. 5 stars i give this one. its a great time killer. very addicted ive but thats ok.
B009YQJ322|2.0|This seems to be another in a long line of 80s and 90s remakes that are some how worse than the originals. When you can say that the Shwarzanegger version of something is better there is something wrong. The same can be said for Stallone. Oh I do not doubt the potential, but for some reason these directors are letting themselves be mired in expectations instead of searching for originality. Even the city in Blade Runner looks better than this. Maybe they should have gotten Ridley Scott to helm this one. Anyway, if you are looking for something that is at least mildly entertaining get The Raid: Redemption. It is the exact same storyline without all the pretention and you don't have to worry about comparing it to Stallone.
B00BCOGM78|4.0|This is such a great album, plain and simple. I was waiting for this to come out for quite some time. Although I liked Strange Cousins from the West, it didn't have quite the mix of energy and American mythos that I really enjoy about the rest of their work. This album, although I feel it still isn't as \\"occult\\" as I could want it, gets my blood flowing.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is a very good retro style game that is always throwing something new at you. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys arcade shooters.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics were better than I expected but I wish it could be easier to get diamonds and energy other than that it was good
B00AL1ONN8|4.0|The king has made another banger! Best tracks are: sorry ft. Andre 3000, go get it, guns and roses ft. P!nk, addresses, and who want some!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The best game I ever played I would give 10 stars if I could. I would recommend it to every one who has a pony or not as if you haven't it is like you have and if you have it is really good practice.  So downlad this game if you haven't already!!!!!!!!!
B00A5052YE|4.0|This is a must have for any Alicia Keys fan! She brings the heat from track two throughout the album the middle of the album have the best songs!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|.! Finally a movie about a game the movie is awesome. I like it a cute funny and simple movie.
B0021AEIUU|5.0|Excellent read. I got chills. If you are lacking in imagination, have no fear. This book was written to make you visualize the struggle between Jekyll and Hyde. I read it in one day.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This was the best game. You get to have tons of fun with it.<br />But be careful of other huge sharks.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Excellent movie. I saw this movie several times when it first came out. I still enjoyed watching it and had alot of laughs!
0062082353|5.0|The book is funny, keeps you wanting to read more and more. Chris Kyles was a  great man, and his book is just as great.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Fun stuff. Good as FAOTD and would recommend it. I like the way they do invincible mode. It's fun! Good weapon upgrades also.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Most fps games on tablet or Mobile are really disappointing. This is quite the opposite. The graphics and gameplay are amazing, the only thing I didn't like we're the controls. Other than that I love it
B008D19WBQ|5.0|My boyfriend is obsessed with Friends and even though the blu-ray's don't have all the features the dvd's do he would much rather have the quality of a blu-ray
B0074VA2T2|3.0|this is a decent and cute app. My main problem is that it is about 25MB. For one app that might get played occasionally, this is too big for me. I deleted it. If I was using it on a tablet instead of a phone this would probably not be an issue.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Lots of features. Great reviews, however it was designed for the Droid. I found it glitchy on my Kindle Fire. I only used it for the notepad.
B005LAII3A|5.0|This movie was well crafted, an action science fiction classic that makes the Arnold version look like a Bugs Bunny cartoon - not forgetting that that film was classic SF fare back then.<br /><br /> Intense chase scenes in the new Total Recall are as good as the best Kung Fu Cinema, beautiful set design that pick up where Blade Runner, an over rated movie, left off! The best and most realistic looking version of the future I can remember seeing.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale is awesome as the Bad Guy boss and kicks ass! And Colin Farrell is perfectly cast in the role of the protagonist.<br /><br />IMO as good as the last two Star Wars movies in every way.<br /><br />When you watch a movie, don't go in with expectations or when you are not ready to watch a movie. Improves your chances enjoyingment.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Keeps a  battery level displayed at all times and breaks down hours of use in a variety of mediums. Nice app!
B001QJUX24|5.0|Based upon a true story with John ford directing John Wayne as you have never seen him before or since
B003O86FMW|4.0|Another fine book, kept moving right along, easy read except that you are always on the edge of your seat.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Loved this book .  I learned so much about the civil war and Lincoln.  I could not put it down.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|First of all, I fell head over heels in love with everyone in this book. It is quite simply an amazing story filled with all types of deep emotions - pain, love, loss, acceptance in the face of uncertainty...<br /><br />This is a heartfelt story of a man who is forced to live a life he couldn't have dreamed of having to live. It's a story of a woman who is living a self-induced sheltered life. It's a story of coming together and completing one another in a way that only fiction can do. LOVED IT!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I really like this game it keeps me busy. I like that I can get stuff from tapping the vehicles.  I don't usually keep interest in these kind of games. I am addicted.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Perfect Easter gift for my kids. All of our favorite characters for the kids but a great story line that will keep the adults entertained.
B000002L9W|5.0|David Lee Roth' road wasn't easy but this is a conclusion of 1984, sorry Van Hagar but Dave kicked your butt with this one. Steve Via, Billy Sheehan, enough said. Yankee Rose, Going Crazy, Shyboy, Tabacco road, and Bump and Grind, also one of my favorites Ladies nite in Buffalo. Keep kicking Dave.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Great mix of hard and soft songs. Hales voice has a vast range of both harsh and subtle tones. Great cd to wind down.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|this game is awesome. i love that there is three levels of difficulties so that it keeps me challenged. i would love to see a prequil
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It was a good read.  ALL OF HIS BOOKS ARE ALWAYS  GOOD READ.  tHAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY..
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have been playing this game for years. I love it. And now my husband love it also. I just download it have been playing all morning.
B003E2UQMS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is very easy to read. The relationship that bossoms is beautiful and if you want a book for a short journey that is your read. It is short yet very enjoyable .
1250027624|5.0|Definitely a must have for any Downton Abbey fan. This beautiful book is full of photgraphs, character stories and period details that fill in the whole story for the reader.
B0031R5K72|3.0|Very interesting story, and well written. not a quick read but well worth a read. Hopefully a movie will follow!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I was perfectly happy with my kindle app on my phone.  Reading from it often.  THEN when i opened it a few days ago all i got was an offer for KINDLE for ANDROID/Black screen and orange letters--Get Kindle for Android.  Since i didn't have an option...believe me i tried, i pressed to get it...thinking i would get my old &#34;stuff' back.  Well, since then all I get is the black screen again with the orange letters wanting me to &#34;Get Kindle for Android&#34;.  I don't know exactly what happened to my first Kindle app nor why this new one doesn't seem to want to open for me either.<br />Can you help me?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Its A Great App Because My Kindle Dosen't Show Me How Much Battery Life I Have Left And This App Does... Not Only That It Tells You How Much Life You'll Have For Listening To Music, Using Wifi, And Pretty Much Whatever Your Device Is Capable Of..
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I have always wanted to know what white noise was, I heard it helps you sleep, I tried this and love it. I also like the looks of the clock.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Good book learned a lot from it and helped me find a word I didn't known and as easy to find.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best keyboard I've ever tried. I've had it on all 4 of my last phones. From the my touch 4g all the way to nexus 4. I've tried and fiddled with many keyboards in the past. But this is definitely the best. Try the free version and judge for yourself.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|This movie is about friendship, and accepting people as they are. It is in French with subtitles, so be prepared to sit down and watch it--it's hilarious and definitely worth your time.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Great for quick and insightful reading. Its fun too. I like the customization of the product.<br />The various topics are good. They can however be expanded somewhat.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|This movie had some great parts, and some parts that looked like they were from an 80's movie, but all the parts didn't fit together that well. I did laugh many times, but at one point, I felt like I was watching a movie-version of Saturday Night Live skits.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Amusing story and voice acting. Character animation is great. A lot of fun to be had trying to tie the animation recreations back to their source movie scenes.
B00457X8BC|4.0|Good action in a political thriller.  Excellent historical referencing around the transition in Baltic states from police state to free society.
1619695006|1.0|Was hoping for a bit of Harry Potterness with an adult twist. This was just vulgar. Multiple cuss words and sexual references. Sad, I was hoping for better.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Great game to pass the time.  Needs a lot of patience to complete a level to continue to the next.
B00333NCTM|5.0|Was a huge fan of Ozzy back in the day. Still learned a lot about him from this book though. Funny as well.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Great game to pass the time.  Very additive.  Once you start, it is very hard to put down the tablet.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son loves this game it helps him control and judge distances.  This is a fun game for all ages.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|And this is a great new way to share learning to my son!<br />Love Technology, it's a great new tool!<br />Thank you,<br />_Dalton
B0074VA2T2|5.0|A great game that helps my son learn how to count.  He loves this game.  I recommend it for your little ones
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is such a great game. I think everyone should get this app. It is so great. if you decide not to get it than you totally suck at making decisions!
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|very touching well done movie well worth exploring. based off of actual events in the life of Dr. John Nash. Very compelling story filled with surprises, laughs, and tears.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I play a lot of hidden puzzle games and this is one of the few that I've played more than once. It has a good and understandable storyline with good graphics. Not the most challenging puzzles but fun enough to keep playing towards the end. It's going to be staying on my kindle for a while.  :)
B000F3UAFC|2.0|Scarlett is wonderful - that's why I bought this movie - and coast of amalfi is wondeful. old woman gossiping is not fun to watch. scenes are nice. not my type of movie.
B00594XOZU|3.0|When it says that you read messages offline you should be able to send them offline. I think if they want you to keep in touch you should be able to send messages withouth the internet
B002G1YPH0|5.0|My computer started with a Dual Core Pentium G6950 2.8GHz and I used it as a media play-back computer.<br /><br />It has been upgraded to be a video game computer.  I bought a Core i5 750s Quad Core 2.4GHz.  At first, I didn't upgrade the cooler (the i5 did not come with one) from the stock Intel unit that came with the G6950.<br /><br />I used the computer for about a week noticing ~55° temperatures in the processor... even immediately after boot.<br /><br />Installing the Hyper 212 Plus wasn't difficult after watching the Cooler Master video on YouTube.<br />And then right after boot and launching of SpeedFan, core temperatures were measured in the 30's.<br /><br />The price on Amazon was better than the competition, and delivery was on time.<br /><br />In conclusion, between the dramatic change in temperatures thanks to the design of the fan/heatsink and the good price, I'd recommend this cooler to any one that needs a higher performance cooling solution.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|The final battle between good and evil. Well worth the wait. A little more dark and sinister than I would like, but full of surprises.
B00005JMJG|3.0|A young girl recommended this movie to me so I bought it.  I wouldn't recommend you spend any movie to watch it.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Great App on my Android Xoom Tablet. I have been using this for years and it always serves all my needs for a pdf reader.
1451675046|2.0|The writing was okay, but I was fairly disappointed in the content. Nearly all of this material is covered in any modern high school.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this game is worth the money I encourage you to pay the money and have some fun morning noon and night quit your job and stay home play this game you wont regret it in promise jobs are over rated but this game isn't over rated its under rated I give it stars to infinity and beyond!!!!!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|It was very well done, but if I was Peter Jackson, I would have shortened it up a bit and combined it with the second half that is coming out and not try to milk the money machine so much. Just IMHO.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great way to pass the time.  starts easy and gets more challenging as you go.  and the price is definitely right.  fun for all ages.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a fun memory game. I like this one because you have the choice of 4 background colors white, green, black or red the cards are white.  It's a fun game.
B006X96PF6|4.0|A great new compilation. I hadn't bought anything from Loreena McKennitt, and this album did not disappoint me.  Good for general listening, and not bad for running.
B005K2YTG4|5.0|This is a cute stylish sleeve that cradles my Kindle Paperwhite.  It has padding inside so you don't have to worry about scratches.  I love the color of it.  It fits right in my purse with no problem and I take it everywhere.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I work with dual 25.5\\" monitors and this device really helped me! Finally, I was able to see the exact same thing on BOTH screens! I tweaked endlessly to try to make them match manually and never could get it right. This helped me fix that in no time! Also, I work on the computer for 8 - 10 hours per day, about 1/3 of which is graphic design. My eyes had been hurting a lot, and I had my screens super bright. You'll notice some reviewers mention a 'brown' tone. Well, at first, I noticed that the white wasn't quite as bright as I had it before, but I figured, what the heck, let's try it for a week. I noticed almost immediately that my eye strain was gone! I also noticed that finally, when clients and I didn't agree about Pantone colors, it was because my screens weren't quite right! I was always off a little because I tried to match with screens that were off-color. NOW, I always match color swatches perfectly when creating web versions of their samples! Seriously, this device is a must-have.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much, can't wait for the next to come out, it had me at the edge of my seat with suspense.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series! So Geeked that it is on amazon! I love that it is not interupted by commercials and ads
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I enjoy this app and the flexibiliaty it has.  It's very easy and convenient to use, I love it a lot.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Very fun and creative movie.  We enjoyed the mixing and song choices throughout the movie.  A few crude moments, would not recommend for under 14.
B00846REIS|5.0|Fantastic writing, not predictable, very entertaining.  I can't wait for the third book to come out, well worth your time.  Riviting.
B00003CXDV|4.0|Did you like Star Trek? You may not like this, but if you have a sense of humor & dig goofy SciFi it's a must see.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this writer, has an excellent balance of suspense, and creativaty.  I hope she writes more, I am an instant fan.
B002ZG994U|5.0|Was buying for a birthday present came in great time.. just like the description said it would look. glad i made the purchase.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All I can say is WOW!!!!  Found myself skipping over the bedroom/redroom sceens to get to the gripping story line, can't wait to see it come out in a movie.  I hope E L James writes more, A very talented writer, and just what women need to break the bordum.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|This movie has excellent tension as our heroes work to save a small group of U.S. diplomats trapped in Iran during the Embassy Hostage Crisis.  This group is hidden and separated from the Embassy.  How can we get them out?  This story shows the innovative approach used and how people work to make this happen.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fantastic story, if someone is bashing this series they obviously haven't read it.  The perfect balance of gripping suspense and play.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I loved the stage show and was skeptical that the movie would be as good.  The answer is an outstanding YES.  While the movie is different is some ways in how it is staged, it is appealing in its ability to show panoramic scenery and the powerful opening scene of Jean Valjean in prison is breathtaking and powerful.  While some of the movie actors voices are not as powerful as the stage play actors, they are quite pleasing.  The movie musical is a powerful and moving experience.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved, loved, loved this book.  This is more like Mr. King's earlier writings, so glad to see he's back, you can tell this was a labor of love for him to write, great detail, keeps you engaged.
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|This is my favorite season of Lost Girl.  It introduces the great characters and their world.  The relationship between Bo and Dyson burns up the sheets.  I have to admit that I think Dyson is one of the sexist leading men in television today.  Of course, Loren, gives him real competition for Bo.  Enter Bo's rich world.  You won't be sorry.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy having this for when I have a few minutes I need to wait before my attention is needed else where, definatly challenging.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Nicely written but far from believable.  Should have ended much sooner. Fun read nonetheless, thanks to the dark humor on deceitful matrimony in midlife crisis.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I picked this up as the faotd and immediately sent my husband to pick it up because I spent my teen years watching him plug quarters into this along with asteroids.  If you liked space invaders you will enjoy this.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I should say honestly one of the best free ones to download.,so far no sneaky spy ware , plays great no crashing and many of many jigsaws that u don't even got to buy unless u really want to. Few thing I would Change. 1.more music although the music lovely after awhile it breaks my concentration.2 ad a spare holder on the side so you could move pieces out of the way for latter.<br />Still worthy of a five star :-) I am playing on a android iPad
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Easy to navigate and a great way to take this on the go - makes planning that much easier to be able to pull up this app and your saves when you need them
B0055PMJMW|4.0|3 great stories.  I love it when the story gets to the point fast. Bosch is one of my favorite characters.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|This book started off well and then became quite redundant and long winded to the point that I skim read the book just to finish. This book is not a page turner, though the framework of the story was the best part. Not sure I would read this author again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome truly. But needs mods,skins,more mobs,TEKKIT,and more but parents, get this game for your kids.It also is 4 out of five percent educational.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|Really enjoying this cd. It feels like Justin is taking music back to it's roots and not giving us some prefab studio crap!
B00846REIS|5.0|Wasn't sure I was gonna be able to read after reading 50 Shades, but this was different in its own way....Gideon and Ava are 2 souls fighting to hold onto their love, but both their past is getting in the way. I love the story line so far and will continue on with the next book.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|So Silver Linings Playbook wasn't the best book I've ever read, but it wasn't the worst either.  It was very &#34;meh&#34; for me.  I am not the biggest football fan, so reading about the Philadelphia Eagles and their annoying team chant, over and over and over again, is enough to make a person insane.  Like, no wonder the main character has mental issues.  If I grew up in a home that repetitively yelled the hometown football team's fight song, I'd probably go mental too.<br /><br />As you can probably tell, I'm not the type to sit and write a review the length of a dissertation.  So for what it's worth, the book was well written and had just enough mystery for me to keep reading.  But seriously, if you aren't a football fan, I'd think twice about reading this book.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Pretty good ear phones for the price. I like them because they stay put. The sound quality is bourderline but does the job.
034580404X|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said by some. I LOVE this series, story, the books. I won't even disclose how many times I've read and re-read. Very pleased customer!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|It was a really good movie. I would recommend it to anyone. It can make you happy and then rip your heart out almost in the same minute. I cried a couple of times because it was really sweet.
8478884955|5.0|Very good quality paper and hard cover. I like hard cover better. The volume itself is nice, and the translation is perfect. You won't be disappointed!
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|When I try and install it says I can't install. It needs 1.89 gb of space but theres not enough on Kindle Fire for apps so how do I download? Please help!
8478885196|5.0|This is the third from the series, and from this one on the whole story becomes amazingly interesting. I really recommend the book itself, from this publisher, its hardcover is very nice, the paper is very good quality. It feels good, and easy to read. For this price, just get it ! you won't be disappointed.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Realistic military films CAN be entertaining, but often times do little more than document things with little style or flair. Zero Dark Thirty has plenty of style, even if it isn't as showy as some dumb American audiences would have liked it to be. I loved the strong character arch. It reminded of The Godfather at times, actually (don't all good movies remind us of The Godfather?) The military sequence was done with extreme finesse, and the ending was absolutely amazing. In the hands of a monkey like Micheal Bay, this movie would have been jingoistic and purely dumb action; Bigelow instead uses the hunt for Bin Laden to highlight the effect it had on Maya's life, and how lost she is after it's over. There are no heroes in war. When Bin Laden falls, easily and without much resistance, everyone seems kind of confused: is it really over? The torturing scenes were done tastefully as well. The movie doesn't appear to have anything but a human agenda. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.
B007O4XX9K|5.0|The great &#34;Funk 49&#34; man.  How great he is !  He even wrote about today's crazy digital world with his very clever &#34;Analog Man&#34; song.<br />&#34;James Gang&#34; Joe is simply the best !
B000000OU0|4.0|Some great new songs by the iconic band, always one of my favorites! Some of the old favs are there, too. They still got what it takes!

B009KEN87O|5.0|I've got a roll of quarters in my pocket and an ice cold tasty carbonated caffeinated beverage in my hand. It's 1985 and I'm in Noahs Arcade ready to take on all challengers. This game definitely reminds me of my childhood.

0451228375|1.0|No dimensions of the book were given in the description, if there had been, I never would have ordered this version.  Print way too small.  The book, however, is a great novel. I called Amazon.  To their credit, they not only gave me a refund, but the store let me keep this one, and I ordered another larger version.

B009KEN87O|5.0|Really enjoying this. It is fun and is much better than expected.  Graphics are perfect retro style with the right modern flair.
1439190275|2.0|This book is about the same as the first. its not worth the money or the effort. You can do the same by restricting yourself to meat and vegetables only, for as long as you can hold out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it<br />So much that I can't describe<br />It<br />It's  s awesome to read<br />I love it so much

B004GYY714|1.0|this ap decided I wanted to listen to the Mizzou basketball game on its own.  no choice by me, just started playing.  I don't think I need an ap that takes over.  I have noticed showing up multiple times in the task killer list.  I'm removing this and sticking with Pandora.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love this case. I have a toddler that loves to throw my phone around, thanks to this case my iphone still like new.

B004LWZW9C|5.0|I enjoy this movie, and parts of it make me cry!  The characters' lives are intermixed perfectly to make it interesting.  It is not meant to be a sequal to &#34;Valentine's Day,&#34; but many of the same actors make an appearance.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|A factual and extremely well acted baseball movie, which is a true story. Brad Pitt, AND Jonah Hill, both have never been better. A great, great movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|About six years ago my cousin Kristen gave me this book and it changed my life. I took its pain and its happiness and bore it as if it were true. This book has altered my life and is very dear to me. If you could do me the favor of reading it yourself, and if you've already read it... read it again. Let the love of Kristen flow into you as it did for me. A huge thank you to Orsan Scott Card.<br />Dave Brown
B004XDYJRU|4.0|It's a great app, but for some reason, it won't update. At first, I thought it was just my device, but when I looked at the other reviews, I saw I wasn't the only one having problems. Other than the update failing, it's a great app. You can listen to any radio station. You can even record something if you don't have time to listen at the moment. Overall, it's a great app.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|His poetry speak volumns<br />His guitar playing is wonderful<br />HIs talent should be recognized and applauded.<br />Not before time<br />What a story

B006LSZECO|4.0|Very well-written and a page turner, but really creepy.  It's hard to like a book when the characters aren't very likable.
1452110581|5.0|I recommend this to anyone who has ever been owned by a cat.  It also makes a great gift for your cat loving friends.
0425263916|5.0|This series is great love the story line and all the characters they are fabulous can not wait to read the third book...have read more books by the author and she is great
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the first book and couldn't wait to read this one, now I can't wait to start the next one.
0425263908|5.0|Can not say enough about these books loved them more than 50 Shades and I loved them....but the story line in these got my attention more and it was not so just about the steamy parts it was about the story as well.  It keeps you hanging just enough to keep you wanting more...
B003VANOFY|4.0|After 3 Months of regular use.   Good 1. In game sound. The 7.1 really sounds nice. 2. Has a nice well built feel. 3. Three configurable controls to fiddle with. I use mine to control Media Player. 4. Logitechs software is easy to use and covers all Logitech G series devices. 5. Quality music playback when in Stereo mode. 6. Mic is very good. Flip up to mute feature rocks. 7. 7.1 for movies/TV is nice. 8. Controls are well laid out and easy to use. Volume adjust in particular is splendid. Did I mention that the flip up to mute mic feature rocks? 9. Good volume. I like my music and games loud. These do just fine.  Bad 1. Small. If you have a large head these are gonna be a bit tight. Don't get me wrong the headset themselves are good sized, but the part where your head fits was defiantly designed for smaller people. They seem to be loosening a bit with time so i'm hopeful. 2. Small ear cups. Yes I have a big head, but no I don't have big ears. They simply don't fit well on normal man sized ears.(dumb on Logitechs part make them bigger and they fit everyone fine) 3. Comfort. The padding and covering on the ear cups is mediocre at best, combined with with the above issues on longer sessions (1.5 hours or so for me) they start to bother you. 4. In 7.1 mode if you listen to music while gaming some songs can get extremely muddy. I'm not talking big bass songs, the headset just doesn't like some songs in 7.1. I listen to mostly 70's and 80's rock. This is an issue only when listening to music and a game in 7.1. Switch it back to stereo and no issue at all. 5. One pet peeve. Mainly for Logitech if they happen to read this. You don't need a Hold the button down power off switch. Where the button is there is no way you accidentally turn these off. And quit frankly the button is nuts. Sometimes it takes 2 seconds, sometimes it takes 4, and anywhere in between. I seldom get these to turn off on the first try.  Neutral 1. Wireless. Its works. I've had no real issues. No static and the connection generally holds well to about 40 feet or so. On occasion they have had an issue holding the connection at any range, but this has only happened a couple of times in the 3 months. 2. Battery seems good so far. Easily get 4-5 hours out of charge. Time will tell how long it will be able to keep that up. Battery is replaceable.  Overall A good gaming headset that is solid for music. Not designed for a head running a 7 1/2 military hat size (usable but not designed). If you have big ears walk away, yes just walk away. I held these in my cart till the price dropped to $70. At that price I am very pleased. If I had paid much more than that they would have gone back based on the comfort factor.  **UPDATE @ 14 months of solid use later adjustments. The list of cons still stands. I will say they loosened up enough where its more comfortable, but comfort still isn't their strong suit. And yes my ears still don't fit in them.  The neutrals I will raise up to good features. The wireless has been very reliable. Very Very few disconnects. The only interference was caused by my Wireless router being within a foot of the dongle. I moved the dongle to the other side of the monitor...no more interference.  Battery life has been excellent, still getting an easy 4 hours out of each charge. Original set of batteries. After 14 months if these broke I would purchase another set.  **UPDATE  @ Over two years later of heavy use.  Battery life is still solid Mic boom is starting to loosen, I can see the writing on the wall with that. But I use my mute a lot and tend to flick it up a bit &#34;brisk&#34;. So I don't hold that against the set.  Headset fit has loosened considerably, but still holds fine. Wireless for long enough that I forgot about the small issues I had earlier until I read my review. Still my only issue with these is comfort level is a little off. Softer Ear cups (both pad and cover) would help tremendously and maybe a touch bigger. That said as these advancein age I will be looking for a deal on another set to replace. Good Headset.
030745455X|4.0|In Stieg Larsson's THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, the second installment in his Millennium Trilogy, it opens with protagonists Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander world's apart, literally.  But just like THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, both Blomkvist and Salander are drawn together in a riveting mystery in which one is aiming to avenge the injustice of her life and the other looking to save her even if she doesn't him to.  The addition of old and new characters to help define give depth to not only the mystery but the dimensions of the fascinating dark version of Sweden that Larsson conceived.<br /><br />For the first quarter to a third of the book, the stage is set for the event that launches the action for the rest of the book.  Though at times it is slow, Larsson's execution after the \\"event\\" shows the genius of that stage setting.  For significant portion of the middle of the book Salander is not heard from making the reader wonder what her true roll in the \\"event\\" was.  In the meantime, the reader follows the police, Blomkvist, and others as they react to the \\"event\\" until Salander shows up once again and things really start to get interesting as not only do we find out what happened to her during the \\"event\\" but also the explanation of her life before THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO.<br /><br />Although I was a tad annoyed with all the build up at the beginning of the book, Larsson's seemingly non-stop pace throughout the rest of the book more than makes up for it.  THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE is a amazing middle installment to this trilogy, building not only what came before but also setting the stage for what promises to be a fantastic finale.
B0068THAGY|3.0|If you do not have anything else to watch, then I would but I cannot say the plot was very good.  The young stars did a good job with the material so I would recommend it to a teenager.
B003ZHVJFK|4.0|I thought it was very well done, even if it didn't seem to follow the game from what I know of the game.  Good acting, great fights, the kids loved it (watched it 3-4 times in a week) and I felt it was safe for them.
B005LAIII0|5.0|My husband and I saw this around last Christmas and expected a decent movie. I wanted to see it more than he, but we both ended up loving it so much we took our kids and saw it again - this time in magnificent 3D!<br /><br />I am definately going to purchase this in blu-ray for our family. If you have not seen this movie yet, you really need to. If anything, for its breathtaking beauty of sights and book-like storytelling.<br /><br />A truly wondrous and classic movie.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Actually 75% was written very good.  But the other 25%, was anticipated and dragged out.  I would like a little more suspense involved.  But nevertheless I enjoyed reading the book.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I read all of these books when I was a wee little girl, and I have to say that this director nailed ALL of these Tolkien books down! I liked the book The Hobbit the least, but today's movie-makers like this incredible director makes it all come to life, and unlike most Hollywood directors, actually added to it for the enrichment of the overall film.<br /><br />I just got my copy of this in the mail, and look forward to watching this again with my husband and children.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Sword slashing, shield bashing, spear jabbing, fun madness.<br />TOP OF THE WORLD is the limit.<br />Good thing you had some humor.
B009XTF8KQ|5.0|I watch a lot of horror movies.  Have for years.  I was feeling numb to them but this one got me!  Actually turned on the lights.  Really great twists.  This is not an Exorcist rip off.  This one is based on old Jewish mythology of the dibbuk.  A human who is so evil they are condemned to live as deamons for all time.  The DVD includes the story behind the story and it is facinating.<br /><br />I cannot say I have seen many movies that feature religious Jews.  I am not Jewish so I am not exactly looking for them.  This one introduces a Jewish exorcism which is not like the catholic one at all.  I was facinated by that.  A glimpse into a world I never see,<br /><br />I have never seen a horror movie where a religious Jew was the hero.
B0041OT9W6|4.0|You don't read this book for entertainment value.<br />When Ann wrote it, it wasn't intended to be a book.  She didn't know if it would be published, who would read it or whether she herself would be dead or alive when it was published.  She literally didn't know the ending to her own story.<br />I decided to read it because we are going on a trip to Amsterdam and will be visiting the Ann Frank House.  I'm familiar with the story, but wanted to read the actual book before going.<br />It's an incredible, amazing, sad story and the message of man's inhumanity to man should never be ignored.<br />The writer shows great precocity and amazing writing skills for someone her age.<br />However you have to wade through a lot of teenage angst and drama and descriptions of the daily minutiae of their lives, and at times it is tedious.<br />If I had to rate it for entertainment value, I'd only give it a 3 star rating.  It feels a little sacrilegious to even write this, but I actually got bored with it and most of the time didn't like Ann very much.<br />On the other hand it is definitely a story worth telling and who better to tell it than somebody who lived it.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|I got this because I haerd that you could put parrent controls on it so I got when it was the free game of the day so I got it and it never downlouded so. ya but I have all the other one but I deleted because I thought. it would downloud but it didint but I liked mc and mc2 and mc3.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The plot was a little far fetched in my view. His other plots had more real life creditability and were not as far off the main path.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Just what we expected. Some problems had been reported with the packaging. We had no issues with it. Love the series and wanted this for a keepsake.  Very happy with it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is another one of Flynn's great stories. You will enjoy this book and have a hard time putitng it down.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Arguably the most memorable romance of its time. Jane Austen never failed at delivering a captivating story that can leave girls and women alike pining for that once-in-a-lifetime love.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is another great Clancy book with realist threat that makes this an interesting book and a great read for the reader
B00992CF6W|5.0|This was everything my son hoped for - He says it is a very fun game.  He would purchase it again.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I'm a musical/broadway junky.  I wish I actually knew more, but I digress..... I had not seen Les Mis on stage so my daughters and I were anxiously waiting for this movie to come out.  We saw it four times in five days.  Overkill, I know.  We LOVED it. I purchased two of these DVD's; one is for me and the other is one that I can share with others so they too can experience Les Mis.  I hope to get the second copy back but if not, I hope whomever ends up with it enjoys it.  (I tend to lose DVDs I lend out to people.... )  :)

0307352153|4.0|An excellent book, and validating of my introverted tendencies and feelings.  It is an academic  work with lots of research behind it.  I found it tiresome to read about studies after a while.  I think it is important.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A little melodramatic at points and sometimes suffers from the dragon ball z effect (&#34;We're going to fight, but let's spend 3 episodes building up to it.&#34;). Overall still one of the highest quality shows on television and rivals/surpasses most feature length zombie outings.
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|First time through, one or two songs didn't instantly grab me. Those have now grown on me too. Overall not one weak effort in the whole set. Tour. PLEASE tour!

B009UX2YAC|1.0|I have tried a number of times to install this game.  I was really looking forward to playing it too.  I get an error message every time that I have tried to install it.<br />I also deleted and downloaded it again with no avail.  really disappointed
B002VPE1WK|5.0|well constructed, convince and reasonable price. I suggest Amazon should provide exactly same backpack with custom designed logo for private groups w/o markup too much.
B001GE6L0M|5.0|Normally I do not listen to albums recorded during concerts.  However, this album is the first that I have liked.  If you like Pink Floyd you should like Live In Gdansk - David Gilmour is one of the original members of the band.  Most of the album is composed of Pink Floyd classics, but David Gilmour's solo work is just as remarkable.  The first song that I heard from the album (on Pandora internet radio) was High Hopes.  After listening to the album / watching the concert on YouTube I knew that this album would be a good investment.
B00138J342|5.0|AWESOME SECOND ALBUM, YOU NEED TO SEE THEM LIVE. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL. ANIMAL, GO, CLASSICS THIS CD IS A CLASSIC
B004UC4HCG|4.0|I got the shuttle box, 8GB DDS RAM, i5 Cpu and 500GB HD. I put them all together and fired it up.<br />My monitor said 'No Signal' and then went blank.<br /><br />I went to the shuttle website and left a message. The form redirected to a page 'pleading' for me to wait 72 hours for someone to contact me. I sent a follow up email explaining how Amazon will refund my money in 48 hours... and within 12 hours I got a helpful response from tech support that resolved my problem.<br /><br />In case anyone else has the same problem, here is what shuttle tech support sent me:<br /><br />&#34;Based on the symptom, this is a typical no POST issue.<br />There are many possible causes that might cause the computer not posting.<br /><br />First, please reseat your memory and only install one memory at a time to see if one of your memory is bad.<br /><br />Then, please check your CPU socket and see if there is any bent pin. Many users bent CPU pins during CPU installation.<br /><br />Finally, please reset your CMOS and see if that fix the problem. Please unplug the power cord, remove the CMOS battery for 5-10 seconds, put the battery back in and turn on the machine.<br /><br />If all of the above does not solve your problem, the problem might be on the motherboard, then we will help you RMA the unit or you can exchange you through your reseller.<br /><br />If you have any question, please let me know.<br /><br />Thanks.&#34;<br /><br />For the record, reseating the memory sticks did the trick.<br /><br />Also, I give it 4 stars because the box is a lot bigger than it looks in the photos.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|Very x-rated, but the plot keeps me reading! What happens next?!!<br />I would like to get to know Mia & Kate better; Jose is a minor character- who is he?  I guess there would not be as much room for explicit sex scenes if there was more character development. A big flaw...
B000003CM9|5.0|Love It!!! I believe the Allmans were at their pinnacle when Dwayne was alive. I love reintroducing myself to truly great American music that I grew up on

B003LSTK8G|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed Hunger Games. It's like a fiction novel that you can't put down... but it all happened. Michael Lewis does an amazing job explaining some very complex concepts to give you a very solid viewpoint into what happened in 2007/2008... things I had heard about, but never fully grasped.<br /><br />Buy this book and read it now!
B005KQVDH8|5.0|The Goonies in HD!!  What is better than seeing the Truffle Shuffle in all its HD Glory!!  Baby R-U-T-H!!!  Thanks
B007L96SI6|5.0|Haley is great and writes the best music.  I love EVERY song.  This CD is a keeper!  The music is the best.
B00BSW6F26|2.0|this is FRUSTRATING!! No hints. I've been stuck on the shapes puzzle in the kitchen for hours. I have the answer from the map, but it won't work no matter what combination I put. I can't move forward and there are no walk throughs. I've touched every single square inch of every scene and....nothing. Very disappointed
0307279189|5.0|Book Review of Born to Run<br /><br />This book is perhaps the greatest tale of how simpler is better and that the old does not always equal bad. It is too easy for modern humans to point fingers at old traditions and scream dogma! But we need to humble ourselves before the lessons of ancient man and understand that we do not have all the answers.<br /><br />Running is the focus of the book and if you really understand the message then it makes the reader think about what the ancients understood that we have since forgotten. Humans are runners, maybe not super endurance runners but capable of sustainable long distance runs. I had forgotten as well and I am now relearning something more ancient than my life. It is in my DNA.<br /><br />I would like to place one word of warning, if humans evolved to hunt and eat meat by running down our prey, than why would becoming vegan and not eating meat be a wise decision on the part of modern runners? Carbo-gel packs and bean burritos are not native to our evolution and the inflammation caused by such food is harmful. The running people did not evolve on beans, but were pushed into non-hunting waste lands by conflict, they did not choose to eat beans and corn. . Just because they eat corn, grains, and beans does not mean it is right.<br /><br />Otherwise the book is inspirational, wonderful, and teaches powerful lessons.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I am using this book as an almost daily 3 or 4 chapter just home form work and still have a zillion - well at least 4 more things to do &#34;me&#34; break. Ellen - you're a genius and funny enough a lot like me!!!
B00005JKZV|5.0|This trilogy is amazing for character portrayals, cinematography and scenery.  You will be engrossed from the start and want to watch again and again.

B004EBT5CU|4.0|great music....however, the CD was smashed horribly when i open the 'padded' envelope it came in. wonder why they can't ship in boxes?
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Great dvd and play great no problem.My daughter playes the movie over and over and works great.It was shipped fast and package was wrap up great too! Great price.I got a great deal Thanks!!!!
B000L53D4O|2.0|We received this item as a gift from a well-meaning relative that didn't want to spend as much money on a walker toy a the one we had put on our wishlist. As far as the front side goes, it's a little boring. The ball in the center makes a fun noise, and the bottom flaps spin easily for our daughter, but that's about all its value.<br /><br />She could not use this to pull herself up- as many others have said, the toy is VERY lightweight. Even though she can pull up and stand using other miscellaneous items and people, this item is much to light to support her with walking on her own. Spend a few extra dollars and get a toy that's a little more exciting and a bit heavier so your child can actually use it to its full potential.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Thank you so very much for sending Belle to my daughter early and We LOVE the movie. It works GREAT and Thank you very much and my daughter Thanks you too! You really made her very happy little girl!!!!!! You are wonderful. Again Thank You Very Much!!!!!!!!!
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|(Spoilers)  The filmmakers on this had a great story that they somehow screwed up.  The book \\"Making Of Psycho\\" is the backbone of this film.  Somehow the producers decided however in order to secure a name actress to play Mrs Hitchcock they expanded her role in this film to include a 2nd story about her and a relationship with a screen writer.  They also changed many other things around and changed some facts. This did not need to be done in order to tell a compelling story.<br /><br /> I know this is not a documentary but \\"Hitchcock\\" could of stayed the course of the book (on which this film is based on).  What should  of been done (Spoilers) was how Alfred Hitchcock himself stood in the shadow of this film for the rest of his career. Also Studio politics could of been told. This film could of focused on how movie going habits were changing at the time \\"Psycho\\" was released.  Tv had an impact on films and yet \\"Hitchcock\\" doesn't address this enough!<br /><br /> If your not a film history buff then this film will not bother you.  If you are a film History buff this film will drive you nuts.<br /><br /> The film runs a brisk 96 minutes.  Its not a boring film but they could of made a better film.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Love the asteroid combination, they thought of everything you want in a vintage style game. The control is great too. Keeps your thumb from covering the ship.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found the book an easy read and very uplifting.<br />I have recomended it to several friends.<br />When you have a family member that has recently<br />past it gives a bit of comfort.
B009X010RU|5.0|I love the protection it provides, is a good price, and that is stands so that my hands can be free is great. I have some arthritis in my hands and it is nice to not to always have to hold it.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Love this game! Reminds me of those old games I used to play years ago. My boys are going to love this game too!
B000002PCS|5.0|This music is great to use as background music for the videos I make to share with my hosey friends.
B00127RAJY|2.0|I bought the 30-day Shred as a tool to take with me when traveling and staying in hotels.  The Level 1, 2, 3 is a great idea.  However, the inability to fast forward over the instructions and introductions is seriously frustrating.  When pressed for time (hello, the idea of 20-minute workouts was supposed to be for time pressed people...), having to sit through the same dialogue over and over again just gets annoying.<br /><br />My fitness level is intermediate and I need to lose about 18lbs.  So, I'm not someone who is like on the Biggest Loser who needs to lose 50lbs+.  However, I found moving into Level 2 the plank positions and quick moves from standing to the planks was for people with a much higher fitness level.<br /><br />I am disappointed in this product.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|This music is great to use as background music when I make my horse videos that I give to my horsey friends.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Coleen Hoover you are my favorite writer, I fell in live with your slammed series and this one has just done it for me again. I feel a real emotional connection to all your books. Hopeless is now on my top 5 loved books of all time. I am ecstatic for the next book in the slammed series. I adore your work. Xo
B0086700CM|3.0|It was fun the first time.  But not one I'd repeat over and over so I'd recommend it as a free game, but I wouldn't pay for it.  Maybe kids would like it more than an adult.
B0058W74UY|1.0|I downloaded this app in order to view flash files embedded in web pages.  Does not seem to work as advertised.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Una muy buena serie, mantiene el inter&eacute;s durante todos sus cap&iacute;tulos. Recomendable 100% sin duda alguna a todos quienes buscan una nueva serie para ver.
B004JK61K0|2.0|It will not take any email program I enter except Gmail.  Not working as I thought.  I'll look for a better one.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book. I really enjoyed the main character. I haven't seen the movie but the book was wonderful. I didn't love some of the football stats but I'm also a woman and I don't like watching football. Getting my husband to read this. Loved it!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Love this, as well as the other Lord of the Rings movies.  Peter Jackson does a great job as director.  If you like the books, you will likely love the films.
1476734941|1.0|I watched Michael's documentary and after watching it I was convinced to try it so I purchased the book immediately. Now with regards to the book itself, the majority of it is the science of why the FAST diet supposedly works and a whole bunch of recipes. That's about 2/3 to 3/4 of the book. The actual diet is fairly simple. So if you want to save some money and do the diet it's as easy as this:<br /><br />Pick two non consecutive days a week to eat only 500 calories (women) or 600 calories (men). For best results spread the calories evenly between breakfast and dinner. Drink whatever calorie free stuff you want throughout the day - coffee, tea, water, etc. Now when you pick foods to eat make sure they are low glycemic (don't have an large impact on your blood sugar). Foods that have a glycemic index less or equal to 50. If you don't know what this means just look it up on the internet. Only foods with carbs have an impact on blood sugar.<br /><br />So that's essentially the diet. I think the book is a waste of money because everything else is just recipes and science and the author even admits that since this FAST diet doesn't actually have any clinical trials on humans they can't really say for sure if all the claims they make will work for everyone.<br /><br />I did the diet for four weeks now and lost 2 lbs and that was after the first week (water weight). I follow the diet exactly as it is prescribed. For breakfast I have two eggs a serving of all bran with half a serving of skim milk and a serving of strawberries (300 calories total). For dinner I eat a piece of chicken and some broccoli (300 calories total). I don't snack during the day and may have a few diet 7ups and 4 bottles of water.<br /><br />Now I've tried lots of other diets, including WW (which I actually lost 50lbs on) and I'm just trying to get rid of another 10-15 pounds but I've plateaued at 177lbs and can't seem to shed anymore weight so that's why I tried this diet. I'll probably stick with the diet just because \\"in theory\\" you can eat freely on other days of the week. Oh and did I mention I play racquetball 4 times a week for an hour at a time? So if someone like me who followed this diet to the letter and exercises regularly can't lose the weight then I have to question the diet itself.<br /><br />The diet's worth trying, but I think it's a waste of money to buy the book itself...<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I've received a few comments regarding my post and just to let those of you reading this review know this, I follow diets to the letter, so I'm not going overboard the rest of the week and I think I did mention I play racquetball 4-5 times a week, so I'm getting plenty of exercise. Just wanted to make that clear.<br /><br />I also received a comment regarding why I thought the book suggested that splitting the calories between breakfast and dinner was imperative. He explains that he took that approach while the woman in the book (forgive me I forgot her name) spread her calories throughout the day. Well if you spread your calories throughout the day that's not fasting. You're basically just eating 500/600 calories a day. So it would just be \\"insert name here\\" diet. The author provides a lot of science in the book and that science implies that the longer the body is deprived of food the more it has to dip into reserves, i.e. your fat storage. That would seem logical to me. If you think different please let me know.<br /><br />If you are snacking throughout the day to reach your 500/600 calories then you're essentially never allowing your body to fully go into that \\"fasting\\" mode. I suppose you could make a case and eat only protein, but anything with carbs in it will effect your blood sugar and take you out of the \\"fasting period\\".<br /><br />I'll probably stick with it, just because I'd rather have two fasting days a week and eat normally the other days. I don't want to be on ww forever. And maybe it's true what some have said, losing the last 10-15 pounds is just really hard.15 pounds is just really hard.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Good game if you only got 5 mins or several hours. Vary exciting and fun good internment. Lots of diffrent armore and weapons to pick from
B006LSZECO|2.0|I felt the book was well written but another book about a couple of self absorbed people who had everything going for them is just not my cup of tea.  By the end of the novel I hated both of them and felt they deserved each other and the only one I felt sorry for was their unborn child.  I read some reviews that condemned the ending but for me it was the most satisfying moment of the entire story.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is truly one of the best shows ever.  Right up there with Star Trek Next Generation, Fringe, and the X-files!!!!!!
B00736ZKGS|5.0|I rate this item based on how excited and how much my young grand daughter loved the DVD,  Loved it very much, rated it a five based on how my times it has been viewed since receiving. Would recommend it to family and friends who have children that are crazy about 1 Direction. Received it in a very short time (from order date), very impressed.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this show, so sad to see it go off the air!  Will see it on the big screen if they decide to do it!!!
B004XJ7HSM|5.0|I normally do not write reviews on movies. But I feel that I would be doing a disservice to those who have not seen this movie. I'm not good at judging cinematography and other artistic values of a movie. But what I can relate to you is that Matt Damon and Emily Blunt were exceptional in the characters that they portray in this movie.<br /><br />It is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. And I watch a lot of movies. At least 2 to 3 movies a day. It has great intrigue, along with a bond that develops between them. And it has so many twists and turns. So that once you think you have it figured out. It does a 180. I don't want to give away any part of this outstanding movie. Do yourself a favor and get this movie. It has a little of of everything. Please critique my review and tell me how I could do better next time. Constructive criticism would be very helpful.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I read in most all genres as long as they are well written. My 'deal' is that if it hasn't engaged me in the first fifty or so pages I've made a wrong choice. This one got me well within the 50-page limit and before long I had read the 'three-together' book and the three 'Shift' episodes and now I'm ready for more. The concept is quite original to me and the characters are well drawn and some are very complex, which I appreciate. I'm so glad I came across Mr. Howey! He now has a fan in the 'old-timers' group. (74 in two weeks!)
0062060562|4.0|Perhaps your problem isn't so serious. This book allows you to feel how it must be to wake every morning, not remembering anything from your past.<br />The story gets tense when it gets dangerous when you can't remember.<br />Don't think we ever give the memory much consideration until we don't have it and we become almost an empty shell.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I bought the book because of the Oscars but I really did enjoy Shines a new lite on what job stress and being a workaholic can do to your life.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my daughter.  She loves it.  I guess that is all I have to say.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is a great little game. So good I intend to purchase it even though I just got it free. To the team at Noctua Software, great job!
B001C4AFOY|4.0|I like this movie,but I`m into the true life history and history anyway.I see these movies and then go and research them to see how close to reality the movie is to history.I know there are things in there that are more dramatized to make it interesting,but this is pretty very close to the history. It`s more of a chick flick, I`m a chick and not offended at chick, so I liked it. Lots of romance.
B0095ZEAAM|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie... Received it in a very timely manner.  I would recommend this to others.  Thank you
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Waste of an app. Expecting the fun of Angry Birds.. It just didnt deliver the fun of a game for me.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really enjoyed the book overall. I felt that it started much stronger than it finished so I gave it 4/5 stars. I didn't feel a strong attachment to any of the characters but was entertained by their journey.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Unlike some rockers who have been touring for 50 years, RT both tours and records, and not just re-hashed versions of old hits. His music is still cutting edge, with the literate lyrics, as fresh as the next big thing from SXSW. I know he is touring now with Emmy Lou and Rodney; must find nearest venue. Oh yea, another great album. (in whatever format you have it.)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never know what is going to happen next in this show. It's hard to wait to see the next one. The characters are great and the suspense is intense.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this game in March, 2013 and I'll tell you I couldn't stop playing it.  So I would highly recommend that you go up and press that green purchase button.  I swear that you will love it and won't be able to stop playing!!!! :D
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you hate this game and you don't even want to get this game than you are doing one and that is wasting your LIFE!
B005K17RU0|1.0|I used this app on my Kindle Fire until today. Downloaded the &quot;update&quot; and was immediately disappointed.  Change isn't always a good thing.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like this app and it works well with my kindle fire vs 7 inch and I recommend it to others too.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|So far, the drama continues.  The first season was the best for me so far but overall, I am enjoying this season as well.
B000KIPT30|5.0|PERFECT SOLUTION! I USE THE SCARLETT 2I2 THE HEADPHONE VOLUME ON IT WAS NOT THE BEST, TOO LOW. AND NOW WITH THIS DEVICE WOW!! I CAN BUMP IT LOUD ENOUGH. DONT EVEN USE IT TO THE FULLEST THATS HOW LOUD IT AMPS THE SOUND. AND THE QUALITY STAYS PERFECT NO DISTORTION.
B00BQLSB3A|5.0|This film has evey element you would expect from John Carpenter and more. Many have panned this limited version, but as you would expect they are the ones that have not gotten one of the 3,000 copies in existence and come off a bit bitter.<br /><br />Anyways this is great fun
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Fascinating! Absolutely brilliantly written. I read it in a single afternoon/evening because I just couldn't put it down. And, as is always true with a good book, I was sad when I realized that I'd reached the end. The plot was wonderfully convoluted yet very clear, and I was only able to guess a few of the minor points before they were revealed. The protagonist was very sympathetic and I found myself wanting to give her a big hug and a cup of coffee (as, being from the States, I'm not a tea afficionado.) Mr. Watson, I can't wait to see what you produce next!
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn is one of my favorite authors, and The Last Man was great, start to finish. I always look forward to his new books.
B008JFLWLE|3.0|A little difficult at first but then can do some good calculations Just be clear on your writting on the screen is clear
B007HACDLK|4.0|Was not disappointed , another Vince Flynn good book. Looking forward for the next one. Have read all his. Collection.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I thought the ending was perfect, but it seemed to drag a lot and I got annoyed to be honest - ready for it to end.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This book is truly inspiring.  It not only illustrates the depth of strength which humans are capable of; it also deeply touches the reader to look at their own life in a new way.  I have had a hard copy of this book for many years, but had not read it.  When I saw it on Amazon, somehow I knew  it was time to purchase it for my Kindle and read it.  I also know it is a book I will read more than once.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Not my favorite read but still interesting because I forgot what it's like to be young and confused! Charlie will capture your heart throughout!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Always keeps you guessing.  A new twist every week.  Bravo Kevin Bacon!  Definitely a show that should keep on going.
B004PIA4BI|5.0|I picked this up to replace the aging battery in my experia x10.  I hadn't decided on a replacement yet and my previous battery was incapable of powering my phone for more than five minutes.  This has restored my x10 back to a full day of usefulness which should last until I make up my mind about picking up a new phone.
0060555661|5.0|Best book ever! I am in the stock investing field and this book is amazing! Its a must read, i highly recommend
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My son loves this movie.  He is really picky so if he likes something it has to be good.  The child is a move critic already.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I've been disappointed with games on smartphones in the past, but THIS one is close to perfect. Not complicated, and VERY easy to figure out without instructions, but still offers varied and inspired game play. I got it on a deal, but it's TOTALLY worth the regular price.
B001AT4Y84|4.0|Anything with Arnold Schwartzneggar is always fun to watch over and over and over.  Great movies, great rental price without having to leave the house.
B00BF11STU|4.0|I thought the move was very good. For me I had to view the movie several times.  I would recommend that people also watch Seal Team Six: The Raid on Osama Bin Laden.  That is excellent.
B002RVCD0U|4.0|Anything with Arnold Schwartzneggar is always fun to watch over and over and over.  Great movies, great rental price without having to leave the house.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|love this game.....hope to see a lot more games that make me think this hard ... this will keep you on your game...
B009KKLQKO|5.0|whoever says this DVD stinks is smokin sum serious crack yall. the version of 1972's All This Is That is just transcendental! Another gem from '72, Marcella, sounds great as well. David Marks really shines on this DVD. He's a greatly underappreciated guitar player who has grown exponentially since he was that scrawny 14 year old playin rudimentary rhythmn guitar in a garage band from Hawthorne, CA. Two great tunes from the new album are performed live here: Thats Why God Made The Radio and Isn't It Time. Both sound great. I did notice Brian Wilson using Auto Tune and then later, Mike Love also, wasn't above using Auto Tune (disappointed a little by this, but not enough to ruin this extravanganza 4 me, kiddies!) Al Jardine and Bruce Johnston's voices have aged gracefully and effortlessly recreate the vocals they recorded when they were much younger. Rememba Kidz, Dis reunion was like manna from heaven, so why all da complainin bout dis n dat and mike love did n dat? I am just happy they 'did it again'
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I really like the origionial ladies, having a hard time with new ones. and the music selection is not like the origional songs.
B00AFEY7QO|5.0|Swing Out sister still is one of my favourite bands. This special edition includes a DVD with a concert in Tokyo which is a great bonus speccialy for those who doesn't have Tokyo Stories already.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I start a series that is not finished. This is an excellent book and will leave you wishing for the next in the series. Good development of characters and while it takes a little bit to get a grasp of the world as a whole the individual story lines are excellent.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Even though I barely started playing. The game seems amazingly fun<br /> You'll love it. The animation is perfect and you can really get into the game
B009KEN87O|5.0|Wow what a trip back to the past. Recommend this to every one!  Buy it you will not regret it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is the complete Season 3 of Downton Abbey and it is awesome. I have purchased all 3 seasons and they are great. The seller shipped very quickly.
1451695195|5.0|Being a skeptic myself, reading what another skeptic experienced, I found this book very helpful. I've been grieving the death of my 22 year old son, and this helped me to understand how he is still living, In the next life, and in paradise.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Classic Hendrix sounds, never heard before.  Not to the scale of All along the watchtower, the immortal Bob Dylan song, but still satisfying to hear the Master wring sounds from an axe no one else can.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Every single song on Babel is absolutely wonderful. Not only are the vocals tight, but the instrumentals are unique and intoxicating. I loved being able to use the Auto Rip feature at Amazon, so I can have the tunes available through digital players and the CD for the car.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|My favorite movie in a long time awesome special effects, this Blu-Ray came very fast and the Blu-Ray is perfect. I personally have all but stopped buying any videos in stores amazon beats Walmart and other mega stores hands down.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|As good as any murder mystery - and has the mysterious about it too boot!<br />Carries the story forward from Beautiful Creatures and provides a nice close that leads toward the next book.<br />Big fan of the whole witches, seers, ghosties and other creatures.  All the &#34;teen-aged&#34; things that go bump in the night.
B002HML6Y8|5.0|Great movie I ordered this after see the movie on HBO, the quality of the video is excellent absolutely perfect condition. The movie came well packaged and I received  it very quick.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|I love this movie. I am a huge Transformers fan. It shows and sounds nice as the blue ray edition.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This games combines a few quite challenging levels with others that seem much simpler. Fun to play by yourself or pass the Kindle around and let everyone try for objects.
B00AA8Q0FQ|4.0|The movies on this are short, but they are still cute to watch and good for anyone who likes Monster High. The two features together only total about one full length kids movie, but the content is appropriate for &#34;tweens.&#34; My daughter has it and said she liked the first feature better than the second.
B00005V9HA|5.0|An amazing movie with an amazing cast. I recommend it to everyone who loves horror, HP Lovecraft, and Jeffrey Combs.
030758836X|4.0|This book was nuts. I'm going to do my best to discuss it without spoilers.<br /><br />\\"Amy didn't care to know my family, didn't want to know my birthplace, and yet for some reason, I thought moving home would be a good idea.\\"<br /><br />This was the point at which I knew things were amiss. What sort of spouse doesn't want to know about your family, your background? All was obviously not how it seemed in Nick and Amy's marriage. But who, if anyone, was telling the truth?<br /><br />The book is very well constructed, so much so that you can completely buy into the improbable circumstances. Because I was late to this particular party, I knew there was a giant twist. So when it came, I wasn't surprised by its existence, but neither was I surprised by its content. I didn't guess it, exactly, but it made sense to me. It almost had to be that way, in order for the story to continue.<br /><br />Don't expect to be able to root for either Nick or Amy. One's evil, the other's a weak whiner, and they're probably both sociopaths. And that's perfectly alright with me.<br /><br />There are actions and reactions in the final act of the book that didn't make a lot of sense to me, and were actually somewhat disappointing. That's why I have to dock it a star. But if you like dark psychological thrillers, with characters you can't quite like, then Gillian Flynn is definitely your girl.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I ordered this film in November'2012 and it finally arrived in March'2013. But I understand this was the manufacturers delay in releasing it. This is an incredible film based on true story. It is also one of the rare times I can actually say the film was better than the book. Wonderful acting, humorous dialogue and at times you easily get caught up in the compassion, devotion and emotion of this moving story. Highly recommend it to anyone.
B0087GJ8KM|2.0|Much of the content is repetitive and entry-level, making this piece most effective for non-client facing personnel.  Not much to add for business development professionals under 30.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Anna Karenina is a great Tolstoi novel that has been very well presented in past movies. The novel is not a farce, but this movie is  silly, farcical, and very poor presentation. It only vaguely represents the story and character of the novel.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Another great movie! glad I bought this one! action and great writing make this worth watching over and over and over.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I just got this to replace my Amazon Basics stylus (which is fine, but small for my hands and not great for longer note taking sessions). The Cosmonaut is the dry erase marker of styli - it's chunky in the hand and very nicely weighted so that you don't feel the need to press down on the screen. Most importantly, the stylus glides easily across the screen making it both comfortable and easy to use.<br /><br />I'll be using it with Papyrus for handwritten notes, and might be using this as my primary input device unless typing. Great product, great service - I'm really pleased.
B000FVE3BG|5.0|Excelent product, very nice presentation, super style and great savings. This is a watch from Invicta that everybody will admire.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Either I read books slowly, and stop around half way - they haven't won me over - or I become obsessed and read them non-stop, unable to put them down. This trilogy was definitely in the latter group. Having Asperger's syndrome myself, I enjoyed reading about Lisbeth Salander and her maybe Aspie, maybe not, life. I also enjoyed the Swedish location - the places, the language, etc. I had already watched the first of the Swedish language movies based on this trilogy - that was what prompted me to read the books. If I ever get back to Scandinavia, I can see me hunting down some of the locations in the books just out of interest.

B002QE3CTY|3.0|excellent story line - writing is good in that it moves the story along well yet not any deep character development - lots of good action with twist and turns - overall a very good read for a rainy day
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I've never truly appreciated 3D until seeing this movie on my brand new Samsung 65\\" Smart TV at 240Hz.<br />It is UNBELIEVABLE to see the level of detail that went into shooting, cutting and optimizing this film for 3D. I gotta tell you my hat is off to James Cameron for realizing the importance of catering to 3D, considering that this was really a project which began 12 years ago. He knew that the audience he attracted would really appreciate this brilliant display of colors and clarity in a whole different dimension. It almost makes you feel like you're on that planet.<br /><br />Anyways, in a nutshell: For the $20 bucks (give or take) this disc will set you back, I guarentee it to be a crowd pleaser for any party or gathering whereby you need to entertain. Or even for yourself, if you like this kind of stuff, you won't be disappointed with this. Remember that this is coming from a guy who couldn't care less for movie theater or IMAX 3D movies as I've never really found them to be very 'dimensional'. I don't know exactly what it is, but this TV in my home shows much better 3D than any movie theater I've ever seen (probably has to do with the fact that the 3D technology is different & glasses are battery operated).<br /><br />A definite buy.

0385366752|3.0|This is an excellently crafted story with perfectly hate-able characters. I have to give it 3 stars at minimum because it's so well written, but honestly, I hated this story. I wanted to stop reading multiple times but I continued because I had to know what happened. I listened to the audio version and the narrators were great, their tone/voices perfect for the characters - very well done. I didn't like the story, though I can appreciate the author's craft. It was just too depressing, and I didn't like a single character in the entire novel.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I chose this book because I want to know more about the war and how it affects out boys.  It's a good read. More detail would have been good but understandably couldn't be given.  I appreciate how Chris ends the book with the perspective it gave him to life in general.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|If you started reading this series for the \\"kinky f-ery\\" then you get it three-fold in this last book in the series and then some. But honestly I don't see what's so kinky about it, seems like healthy couples sex to me! You won't be utterly shocked at the naughty parts but rather maybe about the actual storyline itself! Surprise! There's an actual writer in there after all.  It's no Anna Karenina but it makes for some easy, indulgent reading.  If you were mortified at the writing of the first two books but want to know how the epic tale of Christian and Anastasia ends, you'll be able to stomach this one.  Just swallow your literary pride and do it.

I keep my video library with Amazon because they offer the best prices, their download is fast and reviewing the movie is even faster.

B00447L4KA|3.0|High school. Some of us remember it with fond memories, but the rest look on it as some of the worst years of their lives. Dating, dealing with cheerleaders, jocks, math club addicts, and problematic teachers. That's most of what we remember about high school. 10 Things I Hate About You is a likable film, but takes awhile in getting there, and in the meantime, reminds us of the worst of our high school rejection years.<br /><br />Every boy in the school believes that Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) is \\"all that.\\" Pretty, popular, and currently single due to her father's no-dating standards, she is desired by most of the guys that walk the hallowed halls of the local high school. The newest batch to the group of pining admirers is Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), whose recent move into the district has caused him to immediately start scheming on how to get close to her. Taking up French tutoring just so he can be around her, he is turned down flat when he asks for a date, because her uptight father will not allow it. When Bianca takes her concerns to her dad, he makes an agreement -- once her older sister Kat (Julia Stiles) starts dating, so can Bianca.<br /><br />One of the most trouble-driven brats in the school, Kat's ultra feminism and outspoken nature has made her unpopular with not only the entire male population but most of her teachers as well. The only student even capable of potentially handling her is the rebel of the class, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger). But he's not willing to do something for nothing, and so Cameron and his friend Michael (David Krumholtz) trick money-stuffed jock Joey (Andrew Keegan) into financing this venture, convincing him it would be in his best interest if he intends to ever date Bianca. Thus the price is set at $50 per date, and Patrick has an uphill battle before him. Bianca has never looked on any man without disgust, and he has to win her over before the prom. This isn't much like any high school that I passed through as a teen. The teachers are rude to the students and inconsiderate of their opinions. The principle spends most of her time writing smut fiction, and bawling out the kids with foul language.<br /><br />The movie just seems to hop from one horrible thing to another, before gradually slowing down and allowing the audience to come to like its protagonists. That being said, I cannot really recommend it because there is an abhorrent amount of sexual dialogue and jokes deflowering the script. Joey likes drawing certain parts of the anatomy for fun, including sketching a penis on a boy's face. Mr. Stratford works in a maternity ward, leading him to be obsessed with the possibility that his daughters might be having sex. The principle recites the dirty novel she is writing aloud as she's working on it. In an attempt to distract a teacher so her boyfriend can escape detention, Kat flashes him. Attending a party where alcohol runs feely, Kat becomes intoxicated and dances on a table. There's quite a lot of mild language and sexual/anatomical references. Before letting his daughter go out on a date, her father makes her wear a \\"pregnancy suit\\" to remind her of the consequences of premarital sex. To be fair, Kat does confide in her sister that the one time she had sex, she immediately regretted it, and swore never again to do something just because everyone else was. Insulted that Joey bragged to his friends about hoping to get into her pants on prom night, Bianca punches him several times. The characters do grow on you as the film progresses, and it had kind of a sweet conclusion, but I was disappointed that so much of the production focused on crass material.as a teen.

0132350882|3.0|This book might be good to read for the beginners but I would not say that this is a good book to read for the moderated programmers. And there are multiple reasons for this statement.<br />1. Moderate programmers already know what is written in this book.<br />2. In the vast majority of cases we have problem statement not the write way of solving the problem. I understand that this is not a design pattern of that kind of book but at list it should provide ways of doing that.<br /><br />And the thing that annoyed me too much is that it uses Java too much Java internals. Like don't use lists, JUnits etc. Like I am not interested in knowing Java internals if I would then I would buy Java reference manual or some other book.<br /><br />But overall it is OK book to read.
B00004UEDQ|3.0|Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock) is out of control. A self-proclaimed Alcoholic and part-time drug user, she has completely destroyed her sister's wedding. After arriving forty-five minutes late as the maid of honor, making an embarrassingly bad toast, slap-dancing on the floor, demolishing the four-layer wedding cake, and finally stealing a limousine and driving it to its destruction (all on the intent of 'fixing it')... Gwen finds herself sentenced to twenty-eight days in rehab or jail. It's her choice and obviously... she chooses rehab.<br /><br />Her roommate is a potentially screwed-up teenage girl with a passion for soap operas but a good heart. Slowly Gwen begins to befriend and understand Andrea while finding the other people in her 'group' almost unbearable. There's the misunderstood, stereotyped gay man (in this account a German), a woman mentally abused by her husband's affairs, alcoholics, druggies, cutters... all manner of person seeking help and/or salvation to their incontrollable urges. Only Gwen is rebellious, but she makes the mistake of asking where she can get high... right in front of her camp counselor, who informs her that any mess-up's will send her to the alternative. In an uphill battle, Gwen must choose between what 'feels good' for the moment -- and her live-high-life with her live-in boyfriend -- or to patch up the misshapen hole that is left of her life and find reconciliation with her sister. As Lily herself proclaimed, 'Sometimes, Gwen, you make it really difficult to love you.'<br /><br />The choice isn't that apparent at the first, but soon Gwen is forced into making a decision. She takes more time to understand and help Andrea, who is a secret cutter in times of torment; she also befriends a pro-ball player who admits himself for alcohol rehab. But the time is coming when Gwen must face her sister and try desperately to patch up a broken relationship... after all, she did screw up her sister's wedding, and that isn't easy to apologize for. Overall, the film has a good heart. It casts drugs, sex, and alcohol in a bad light. Unfortunately, it also laughs at them. There are several implied sexual scenes -- two of which are seen in passing in an elevator between patients, another with a man coming half-dressed out of a woman's room -- and lots of innuendos. Andrea's soap is desperately bad, with bed-hopping characters (only hinted-at with dialogue) and a wink at a sexual relationship between unknowing half-siblings. When Andrea is released from rehab, Gwen and her friends do a mock parody of the show that hints at these various discrepancies.<br /><br />There's brief rear nudity, implications of past improprieties, and some immodesty. Overlooking the sensual current that flows through much of the film, there's also bad language (one f-word and many mild profanities, as well as repetitive uses of Oh, my God!) and substance abuse. Gwen nearly kills herself by trying to rescue the drugs she threw out the window only hours before. Boyish jealousy comes to blows. There are a lot of flashbacks as Gwen begins to remember the past... her childhood with an alcoholic mother. There's also a drug-induced suicide that leaves emotional scars on many of our prominent characters.<br /><br />There are a lot of elements of good in the film, but in all honestly it shoots itself in the foot with sensuality and brief profanity. I was able to look past the flaws and find the lessons tucked away in the film's packaging, but those looking for a fun Sandra Bullock film like While You Were Sleeping or Miss Congeniality will be disappointed. The laughs are uncomfortable, but the heart-tugging moments of reconciliation and change very real. At the risk of giving the ending away (which seems to end prematurely) Gwen does choose to abandon all ties with her past and walk 'cleanly' into the future. 28 Days tries very hard to be both comedy and drama, but winds up being much more serious than comical.e for.

6305744793|3.0|Everyone remembers them, the gaggle of funny misfits from the grand old days of black and white television. The Addams Family have become synonymous with morbid humor, and the film is no different. It's even quite charming, in a rather bleak kind of way.<br /><br />Most families have an eccentric or two, but this one has six. The Addams Family are known throughout the neighborhood for being rather grim. There is the rather obnoxious Gomez (Julia), who purposefully breaks windows in his neighbor's house just for fun, his delightfully morose wife Morticia (Huston), who trims roses and keeps just the stems, her deranged mother (Malina), the infamous Frankenstein-like butler, called \\"Lurch\\" (Struycken), a disembodied hand called \\"Thing,\\" and the children: Wednesday (Ricci) and Pugsley (Workman), who live purely for the joy in electrocuting one another. Employed by the Addams Family is a local lawyer, Tully Alford (Dan Hedaya), who is deeply in debt. Knowing that his employers seem to have a boundless amount of gold deep in the family vaults, he attempts to discern how best to take it from them.<br /><br />Brought into this dubious plan is the woman responsible for the misery in his life, the woman to whom he owes a fortune. Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) devises a plan to pass her reluctant and mentally deranged son off as Gomer's long lost older brother Fester (Lloyd), who vanished some twenty years before and was never heard from again. Fester is welcomed into the house but treated with suspicion by the children, who suspect that he is up to something. Even as he attempts to discern the secrets of the monstrous old house, Fester finds himself lured deeper into their world of morbid fascinations, sadistic pranks, and melancholy dinner conversations, which places his mother's plan in jeopardy. Not everyone will appreciate the kind of humor to be found in this creepy little film, but more than once it had me smiling. This is the most deranged family you will ever find, and yet they are wonderfully appealing. The children and their attempts to decapitate one another (never meant in ill humor).<br /><br />Gomez and Morticia's youthful passion whenever they have a moment alone. The antics of \\"Thing\\" as it scampers about the house. If you liked the old television series, you will enjoy the film. If you are not familiar with either one, you may want to be forewarned that a healthy, morbid sense of humor is a must if you intend to visit this sinister domain. The casting was perfect, particularly Huston as Morticia, a woman who is empirical but also beautiful. Ricci's performance is extremely restrained, as the character is very morose and withdrawn, but the children grow on you. I am not sure why this was given a PG13 rating, as there is very little inappropriate content, and must conclude that the antics of the Addams children might have encouraged kids to follow dangerous experiments. They are shown hooking one another up to electric chairs, standing in the rain with an antenna in the hopes of attracting lightening, chasing one another around the house wielding mallets and knives, and horrifying outsiders with a gory depiction of a sword fight, complete with fake blood that sprays the first two rows of observers.<br /><br />There is no sexual content, but Morticia and Gomez make out passionately on several occasions. Mild innuendo intrudes, along with sparse profanity. There are some nude statues in the graveyard. Dark humor involves conversations about death, jokes on torture and pain, food that is still moving on the plate, and quips on mortality. The only element that made me particularly uneasy was the presence of a s&eacute;ance, when Grandma rubs a crystal ball and calls out to the spirit of Fester. Rather an unorthodox film in many respects, The Addams Family will appeal to those who enjoy worlds in which everything is slightly out of turn, but for more sensitive audiences, I would recommend Lemony Snicket instead., and yet they are wonderfully appealing.

B009EP3DJM|5.0|The most anticipating sophomore album, from pop star sensation Ke$ha, was sure to hit big numbers in record sales. Despite the low average of $$ it picked up on its first week release, people have been raving on how amazingly infectious this album is. Being a huge fan of hers when she first hit the scene with Tik Tok, I fell in love! I downloaded a few tracks from her debut album \\"Animal\\" and thought \\"Hey, these songs are pretty badass, let me finish downloading the whole record!\\" Boy am I glad I did, every song on that album defines what pop culture is all about! I had it on repeat in my car, in the shower, in my room, just everywhere! \\"Cannibal\\" then came around and was an outstanding companion to her first album. It showed a more sensitive side to Ke$ha with \\"The Harold Song\\" and \\"C U Next Tuesday.\\" After the summer hit single \\"Blow\\" started to die down on the radio, she disappeared. She went off the radar for a whole year. Interviews started to pick up on what to expect on her new record and it made me anticipate the album even more! December 4th, 2012 finally came around and when it did, you bet your little patootie I was the first one in line to buy it. After anxiously unwrapping the CD in my car (explicit version) and fed it to my CD player, Warrior began. I nearly fainted driving home. Each song was giving me an eargasm!! I couldn't help notice the departure from what \\"Animal\\" sounded like but definitely not in bad way. It's like she reinvented herself into something bigger and better. I admire the fact she took the route of less atuo-tune and showcase more of her vocals because the woman can sing! There is not one single song on this album I dislike, even though \\"Wherever You Are\\" had me at hitting the skip button the first couple of times. She's come a long way and this is her best work to date. I can't wait for her to go on tour and sing these beautiful songs live. If you're an animal and loved her previous work, this is not to be overlooked, or just anyone who has a knack for fun dance tracks, this is jam-packed with them. Do yourself a favor and don't think twice about making this purchase, DO IT NOW, you sincerely won't regret it :)
B00005JL7Q|3.0|Although a definite improvement over some of the studio's prior projects, About a Boy still has a cold, dead, and crude heart that believes the general public's desire is to love a womanizing deadbeat like this film's 'hero,' Will.<br /><br />Living life as simply and pleasurably as he can (which includes always looking 'hot,' and hitting up every single woman on the street for date and evening sex), Will has a real problem. He's shallow. He's not as much of a chick magnet as he used to be. And... he has a plan. Realizing that divorced women with kids are somewhat easier to manipulate, he decides to masquerade as a jilted husband and father with a made-up toddler, all in the prospect of finding new ground. He hooks up with a pretty young woman at the single parents' meetings, but their one date falls flat when she insists on bringing her best friend's kid Marcus along. The youngster is too smart for his own good, but sadly in need of a good influence. Unfortunately, Will isn't the right influence on his life and the film takes a hair-raising turn when they return home to find Marcus' mom unconscious from an attempted suicide.<br /><br />Marcus likes Will and attempts to set her up with his mom, whom Will befriends first superficially, but then more deeply when he realizes that she truly needs help. In a humorous twist, Marcus learns that Will is only pretending to be married and a father, and uses this against the 'would-be dad' to gain his own advantage. In the meantime, Will is beginning to fall for Rachel, a single mom in their group. Not as a future sexual prospect or a one-night stand. As a real person. The only problem is that she believes Marcus is Will's son... and he can't fess up. Although the film has a good heart and the selfish Will does improve with time, About a Boy is a rocky, often cynical and uncomfortable ride through what could more accurately be called About a GIRL. Perhaps the story isn't really about Will at all, but more accurately, about Marcus... and single mothers. Taking such an offensive standpoint as looking at divorced and single mothers as future sexual prospects doesn't do a great deal to endear Will to the average viewer. Some, like myself, will be downright offended. The film also flirts on the serious side with a manic-depressive mom who is suicidal. The only bright spot in the film is the kid. Marcus has a crush on a girl at school, and despite Will's interest in whether or not the kid wants to get physical, he merely replies that he just wants to talk with her. Nothing else is necessary. Surprised, Will waves it off... but later comes to the same conclusion about Rachel. The kid also pushes honesty in relationships and encourages Will to be truthful with himself.<br /><br />Will eventually sacrifices his own reputation for the greater good, but this won't be enough redeeming content to send many teens flocking to the theater. In fact, the good pales in the evidence of the bad... sexual content and profane language. Violent content is limited, although bullies torment Marcus at school. He also accidentally (but cruelly) kills a duck at the park by beaning it with a loaf of bread. Language is the next biggest problem, mounting in two f-words along with many British alternatives that mean the same thing; abuse of Jesus, Christ, and God's name is heavy, along with many minor profanities and crudities, including a running gag that involves a song with 'ass' in the title. The most alarming aspect of the hordes of disgusting language is that most pop out of Marcus' mouth. This Boy needs his mouth washed out with soap.<br /><br />Next comes the sexual content, which is used more in dialogue than anything else. Will is forever making sexually-oriented comments, both in mouth and mind. He looks at a porn site (implied), talks about his anatomy, and one of his girlfriends suggestively straddles and kisses him. The worst moment of the film that should make all of the women in the audience throw theirpopcorn at this lousy rat is when he's asked to stand as godfather for a little girl. Callously he says that wouldn't be a good idea, since when she eventually turns eighteen he will probably take her out, get her drunk, and possibly sleep with her. What good lessons they have are awash in disgusting content and sadly worldly views of love. About a Boy isn't really about a boy at all... it's more a vision of what our society has become. And it's a sad one.popcorn at this lousy rat is when he's asked to stand as godfather for a little girl.

B001OQCV2E|3.0|Roland Emmerich is the king of disaster movies. On 9/11 as the entire world watched buildings tumble, the universal response on everyone's lips was \\"it's just like Independence Day!\\" He's done it again with this film -- a terrifying, mind-blowing epic in which the earth has a major meltdown.<br /><br />Few people know what is about to happen but the few that do become powerful. Top scientists have been sensing the earth's core heating and predict that in 2012 the earth's crust will shift -- forever rearranging the continents and creating mass devastation that will result in a global apocalypse. Believing the populace should be warned of the impending disaster, Dr. Adrian Hemsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) pleads with his superiors to release a statement in the wake of recent tremors... cracks have appeared in seaside states and he does not think it is right that only the wealthy people who can afford a ticket on the ships they have designed to withstand the judgment are to be saved. Unfortunately, global leaders disagree -- even though our president (Danny Glover) has serious misgivings about it. His daughter (Thandie Newton) has been employed in saving priceless pieces of art, although she is unaware of the reason why.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the ignorant masses know something is happening but not what -- and it is purely by chance that Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) catches on. During a camping trip to Yellowstone National Park with his kids, he happens to hear the local \\"nutcase\\" on the radio predicting what will happen. The signs are all around him and fortunately, he takes them seriously -- but will it be enough to save his family when there is literally nowhere to run? From start to finish, this movie captivates you -- not only with its astounding visual effects (which manage to be both incredible and alarming -- there is nothing more horrific than watching a tidal wave smash an overturned military ship upside-down onto the White House) but its constant pace. It never lags in spite of being well over two hours in length and it manages to emotionally invest us in the lives of a dozen different characters, even though some of them do not get much screen time. The cast is perfect, the script is good, and in terms of being a visual epic it succeeds.<br /><br />The one thing that makes me hesitate is that in spite of being glued to my flat screen for the duration, in the back of my mind was the realization that I was watching billions of people die as a form of entertainment. Even though it is just a film and not real, it's still hard to comprehend the entire world's population perishing in a multitude of horrific ways -- drowning, falling into cracks in the earth, being smashed by tumbling pieces of rock, or crushed underneath toppling buildings. In a world where we have actually seen these atrocities, it seems insensitive in a way -- but that aside, apart from those thematic events the film is surprisingly appropriate. Major disasters unfold and people die, some of them main characters -- a few we see their fate and others' fates are implied. Do not expect everyone you are introduced to in the course of the film to make it. Buildings fall, volcanoes erupt, cruise liners overturn, planes go down, and much more. None of it is explicit so much as disturbing. There is some scattered profanity, an f-word you cannot hear (it's mouthed), and about eight abuses of GD and one or two of Jesus' name. One character flips another off. Sensuality is limited to a man suggesting to a woman that they \\"make a baby.\\" There are numerous references to religion, some reverent and others dismissive. (Priests and masses gathered at the Vatican for prayer are crushed beneath it when it falls.)<br /><br />Family is at the core of this film, since everything Jackson does is ultimately to save his ex-wife and kids -- and even his ex-wife's boyfriend. There are also numerous instances of selflessness in which various people die saving someone else (or in one case,saving a dog!). This is contrasted with astonishing selfishness on the part of certain figures in the cabinet. The ending message is that humanity is nothing if it loses its compassion for other human beings. Even when the visuals had faded and I breathed a sigh of relief at the end, it was that more than anything that I remembered. It's not for the faint of heart and if the thought of mass casualties turns your stomach I would recommend skipping it, but for those looking to sit on the edge of their seats for two and a half hours, this one is a thrill ride.saving a dog!).

B001UV4XUG|3.0|This is a story about love, but not a love story.<br /><br />That is the warning audiences receive when venturing into (500) Days of Summer, an interesting Independent film about a young man's struggle to overcome a broken relationship.<br /><br />They meet in the office. Summer (Zooey Deschanel) walks into the room as a new executive assistant at a greeting card company and stars explode around her, at least as far as Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is concerned. She likes his music, his movies, and was pretty as a picture. An eternal believer in true love, Tom knows at once that she is the one he has been waiting for his entire life... unfortunately, Summer is a practical girl scarred through memories of her parents' brutal divorce and doesn't believe in true love. Or even dating. It takes all Tom's wrangling just to get her to pay attention to him and then hang out sometimes. But just when he thinks their lives are approaching a monumental moment, Summer drops a bombshell on him: she doesn't see their relationship going anywhere and thinks they should both move on. Which apparently is easy for her, but not so much for Tom, who dwells on their unusual relationship in an attempt to figure out what went wrong.<br /><br />His employers put him to writing \\"sympathy\\" greeting cards in the hope he can eventually pull out of this funk, but in spite of his friends' encouragement to remember the bad aspects of his relationship as well as the good, Tom remains convinced that Summer is the one for him... and wonders what he can do to get her back. I admit that this movie had me fooled: midway through I was certain of the outcome but was proven wrong! It takes a non-traditional approach to the genre of romantic comedy and manages to be both funny and sentimental. It has a well-written script that captures \\"real life\\" very well -- the dialog is believable rather than being forced and it made me care about these people and their relationship. The approach is a bit tongue in cheek with the intention of being amusing but is also dealing with a very serious topic -- what happens after you break up? How do you overcome your emotions and move forward with your life? The message is that they might be the right person for you, but you might not be the right person for them. It's not a very pleasant notion but is what makes the film unique and sets it apart from other titles in the genre.<br /><br />Language is something of a problem with one f-word, several harsh abuses of deity (including one GD), and quite a few uses of the word s**t. On a dare, Tom and Summer sit in a crowded park and shout \\"penis\\" louder and louder until they draw everyone's attention. She later teasingly threatens to do it at a wedding. There are no graphic sex scenes, but they do some heavy kissing on a bed and the camera reveals part of her bare back. For fun, the two wander into the \\"adult\\" section of a rental store and decide to try out some of the moves they see on the film (we don't see the video but do watch a shower curtain jerking around before it falls on top of both of them). Other scenes imply she has spent the night, and sex is discussed a handful of times. Tom's friends make some crude references to breasts. There is a fair amount of drinking and several instances of intoxication.<br /><br />(500) Days of Summer is a movie you will either find unsatisfying due to its unusual ending or that will tickle your fancy. I appreciate \\"odd\\" stories and so this one appealed to me on many levels. The humor is well done and the characters actually mature and change throughout, which is refreshing to see. The cast is terrific even though most of them are not very well known, and the direction and style of the project is quirky. We constantly move back and forth in the relationship timeline with the assistance of helpful notations but it is never confusing. There's even a musical number in the middle of the film, complete with animated birds and everyone on the street joining in on the fun. It's a film without classification and its themes are both memorable and charming. Essentially, the audience is left with the realization that if you do not like who you are, it is within your power to change your life if you choose. It's a powerful message.ning in on the fun.

B000LXHK2C|3.0|After the separation of his parents, as a child Max Skinner (Freddie Highmore) would spend the summers every year with his Uncle Henry (Albert Finney) at his French vineyard. There, Max learned to appreciate the finer things in life... the beauty surrounding him, the taste of a good wine, the luxury of a good book. But those summers are long gone, since Max (Crowe) is now one of the most formidable, fiercest stock tradesmen in the European market. His very existence makes his competitors (Richard Coyle) mad with envy, since he can dump, trade, and spike stocks with his morning toast. Distant, have become his memories of carefree summers and spring vacations. The word isn't even in his vocabulary now, since everyone knows that a vacation is the perfect time for someone else to steal your job. Rather self-centered and cynical, Max is only mildly impacted when he receives news that Henry has passed away.<br /><br />Without a proper will, his nearest living relative is free to claim the estate, so Max reluctantly hops on a plane. His French is rusty, his driving skills impaired, and his interest in the vineyard minimal, since it produces only rubbish by the way of wine and seems to be falling apart around his ears. But the longer he stays there, making arrangements to sell long-distance with his attorney (Tom Hollander), the more he remembers his Uncle Henry and the wonderful times they had together. His life becomes infinitely more complicated and interesting when a beautiful woman in the village (Marion Cotillard) holds a grudge against him for inadvertently running her off the road, and an American girl (Abbie Cornish) shows up claiming to be Henry's illegitimate daughter. The result is a sweet romantic comedy that falls a little flat in its believability.<br /><br />One of the things I loved about the screenplay is that it truly had a unique premise, in addition to being brilliantly filmed. The flashbacks are so unexpected and touching that they are rather like remembering something yourself rather than being pulled into someone else's life. Everything about the film is beautiful, from the golden tint of childhood experiences to the lush colors that contrast with the old stucco house. The message is one that has been told before, but never with quite as much charm. I loved that in the first half, Max was permanently attached to his blackberry and as time passed, it rang less and less often as he became interested in the world around him. Falling into an empty pool and being unable to get out was also funny, particularly when his rescuer thinks it would be more fun to turn on the water than find a ladder. There were also a lot of unexpected, familiar actors that brought a smile to my face.<br /><br />Unfortunately, one thing kind of ruined it for me... that the filmmakers expect us to believe that after one date and impromptu sex, Fanny and Max love one another. I was disappointed that their relationship was not pure, because it would have given them a lot more chemistry not to go all out so soon. It is my most prominent gripe with the film, but it also has quite a lot of language (mostly s**t, but at least one muffled f-word, a couple abuses of God's name, and lots of references to English slang such as \\"shag\\"). The French housekeeper smacks Max on the bum a couple of times. Conversation revolves around whether or not it would be improper for Max to become sexually involved with his cousin (he doesn't). The scene with Fanny and Max involves undressing, and passionate kissing. There is some immodesty among the women, including a glimpse of a woman's thigh (she's showing off a bruise) and a brief view at a woman's naked backside as she lays on a bed (she asks someone to look at her sunburn).<br /><br />One thing that might bother many audiences is the amount of drinking in the film. If there's a glass around, it has wine in it. More troubling is Max at age eleven becoming a connoisseur of films. Henry serves him alcohol on morethan one occasion. Despite its faults, I was entertained and even touched by it, but it would have been much better without all the sly innuendos and the pointless love scene. True love is formed over time and through troubles, not over one night's spontaneity.than one occasion.

B0085A9HXS|2.0|The movie was awesome, but I probably would have enjoyed it more in it's original language with English subtitles and for whatever reason that option isn't available on this blu ray. The English dubbing is really cheesy. Pretty disappointing, I would return it if I could. If there's something I missed on the disc that enables this please let me know because I thoroughly enjoyed the fighting and action.

B00BCZU8WM|1.0|As a huge JT fan, I was sorely disappointed when I started listening to this CD. I wish I hadn't preordered it. The whole collection of overproduced, almost surgically stitched songs is nothing but an unbearable noise. All this hype for nothing.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I'm using the same model since some years and was always very happy with the handling and sound.<br />Therefore, I checked since a while in shops the headphone corner to find replacement in case the wires may go bad some day.<br />Unfortunately, this model was not offered in shops and I was convinced they are out of production.<br />Just by surprise, I entered the model description in the Amazon search and was glad to find certain offers for my preferred headphone. The price was reasonable and I decided to order two sets to have a spare set for other equipment.<br />Mostly, I use the headphone at the Pool listening to MP3 files or the local Country Statin with my Mobile phone.<br />The sound is perfect and the lightweight construction makes it easy to wear this set over long time.<br />If you need a good sounding and lightweight headphone, this model is just right.

(as far as I can tell, no &#34;big&#34; names thankfully) ... and an excellent chance to sort of &#34;re-visit&#34; the series as a sort of &#34;post mortem&#34;.<br /><br />If you are at all a fan of the series, I am pretty sure you are going to truly enjoy digging in to these songs.  If you are a fan of &#34;indie&#34; performers, likely you'll enjoy this song selection as well.<br /><br />Hope you find this review helpful, and I hope many people enjoy this as much as I do! (ps, I use this selection to &#34;wind down&#34; my treadmill time at the gym :-) ... great &#34;walking / contemplating&#34; music!

B008HLZUUE|4.0|I bought the fourth book after finishing off the previous three fairly quickly.  I thought I was getting the medium sized paperback when I ordered based on the dimensions but it ended up being the small paperback.  Seller probably needs to update those dimensions.<br /><br />I was almost thinking about sending it back when I decided to jump in and start reading.<br /><br />The small size had a strange feel at first but then as I got used to it, I appreciated how light weight the book felt.<br /><br />I'm about 500 pages in so I'll give a quick review  of A Feast for Crows with no spoilers.<br /><br />George R R Martin changed his chapter titles for this book.  In the past the characters name was the chapter title.  This book still will use characters names occasionally but more often he uses a description (The Kraken's Daughter).  Odd choice to change up the chapter titles so late into a series.<br /><br />This book focuses very closely on two regions of Westeros:  The Iron Isles and Dorne.<br /><br />The other books were all over the map but since this one is more focused, you really getting a better feel for those two areas of Westeros.  It seems that the culture and people really come to life since you aren't jumping all over.<br /><br />Definitely pick it up if you're a fan of the series.  Make sure you've read the previous three first!

B0060MYM7O|5.0|I picked this up a few weeks ago for a fantastic price on Amazon.  I've seen every episode of Game of Thrones many times over and finally decided to pick up a Blu ray copy for a better quality picture.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this set.  Not only is the picture quality stunning, but the extras really make the set worth while for people that have seen the episodes multiple times.  It also came with a digital copy and dvd copy just for kicks.<br /><br />The extras include commentary by the writers, director, and actors from the series.  Each episode has interactive guides on which house / character appears in the scene along with some background information on each.  There are also quick video shorts which flesh out more history of Westeros and battles referenced in the episode.<br /><br />I couldn't be happier with this set and highly recommend it to anyone else that is a fan of the series.

B003XOXPMK|5.0|Original pressings of ATCO Records' DISRAELI GEARS (SD 33-232) are on their maroon/white/tan label. Some prefer that company's mono version (33-232).<br /><br />This classic British psychedelic blues LP features the original power rock trio: Jack Bruce (lead vocals/bass), Eric Clapton (elec. guitar/vocal), and Ginger Baker (drums/occasional vocals).<br /><br />Recorded during May '67 in just 3½ days at NYC's Atlantic Studios, \\"Disraeli\\" was hugely popular in the US, peaking at #4 on Billboard's 200 Albums chart and #5 in the UK.<br /><br />Producer Felix Pappalardi co-wrote with his wife Gail Collins the introspectively philosophic \\"World of Pain,\\" also \\"Strange Brew.\\" The latter got released as a single soon after it was recorded. Topping out at #17 in Britain, the song didn't chart in America. It's based on a 12-bar blues called \\"Lawdy Mama,\\" a tune that Cream had previously waxed with ATLANTIC/ATCO prez Ahmet Ertegun.<br /><br />The group's only US Gold Record, \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" was #5 on Billboard in January of '68 and #25 in the UK. (Jack Bruce wrote it after attending a Jimi Hendrix Experience concert.) Tom Dowd's engineering on \\"Sunshine\\" has always baffled this listener, for Ginger's drum kit is so heavily damped and mixed under he could've pounded the skins and cymbals with a sledgehammer and still have been nearly drowned out by the guitar and bass. But hey, it was a charting single despite this, yes?<br /><br />The \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" flipside, SWLABR is an acronym for \\"She Was Like a Bearded Rainbow.\\"  In a mostly psychedelic album, their Blind Joe Reynolds cover of \\"Outside Woman Blues\\" returns to music the guys recorded on their debut LP, [[ASIN:B00734XAT4 FRESH CREAM]] (released: Dec.'66).

B00AU15HPC|4.0|I must admit that when I first heard this CD, I was totally dissapointed. A victim of high expectations. I have been a Justin Hayward fan since 1969, when I was only 11 years old. Over these many years, his voice and music have carried me through all of life's celebrations, and sadness. Each album seemed to include a song that was just perfect for that time in my life. The last being, December Snow, which I first heard as my wife lay dying of ovarian cancer. She passed away in November. \\"Then November came, taking all I have, and time, take this sadness from me.\\"  Just perfect.<br /> So I expected \\"Spirits\\" to contain one of those songs, that really spoke of my life, today, and I didn't hear one. I could believe that not one song even remotely took me to the places that Justin's music had taken me in the past. No December Snow, I Dreamed Last Night, Children of Paradise, Driftwood.... Nada..... It left me cold, and confused. How did this happen?  Why?  It was like saying goodbye to a longtime friend. I was actually quiet sad.  HOWEVER.....<br />  As a funeral director, I often find myself in moments that touch me deeply, to the point of tears. Yet, most of the time, I save those tears for my private time, when I can really let them go.<br />  I had a day last week, that was exceptionally emotional. A beautiful celebration of a man's life. A man who was deeply loved by his family, followed by twin baby boys, who died prematurely. It was one of those days that I really held back the tears.<br /> On the way home, I decided to give \\"Spirits\\" another listen, because Justin's voice is like a hug from a dear friend. I needed a hug, and I got it.  I was listening to Lazy Afternoon, when the \\"floodgates\\" suddenly opened wide. Not only was I releasing the tears of sadness from the day's events, but tears of joy as well, because my \\"old friend\\" Justin, was there with me, once again. Once again, his music found it's way into my heart. Once again, a song that was perfect for themoment.<br />  Today, like a fine wine, Spirits of the Western Sky, has slowly become one of my favorite Justin Hayward CDs. It's taken longer to warm up to than the others, but it contains some beautiful songs. The lyrics are simple, the music, soothing (aside from the techo) and the recording, outstanding.<br /> My only complaint,and I think it's one of the real reasons I didn't like this CD at first, is the inclusion of the bluegrass tunes, especially, Broken Dream. Leave perfection alone. I'm not a fan of bluegrass, or country, so the inclusion of these songs, seem like, \\"weeds amongst the flowers.\\"  Out There Somewhere, works for me. Great energy!  Yes, I would like to have heard a classic Justin Hayward closing song, that left me sitting there saying, wow, not whoa!! But it's fresh, and modern, and I love techo.<br /> So all in all, this is a CD worth buying, and savoring like a fine wine. It needs some time to \\"breath,\\" but the \\"finish\\" is worth every sip.
B007Y36K46|3.0|Note: I saw this movie in 3-D via XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />Based on a series of books by the writer of Tarzan, John Carter is a fairly good action-adventure-science fiction film. The acting is solid, especially from usual villain Willem Dafoe playing against type, like he did to wonderful effect in the Oliver Stone classic war film PLATOON. The storyline is engaging enough, and the visuals are very impressive, especially in 3-D. The music is also quite good. So, why the three stars?<br /><br />Walt Disney Pictures has always been a family-friendly company, and while some of their latest PG & PG-13-rated films include mild-to-moderate profanity, they HAD NEVER, EVER, EVER combined the Name of God with a mild curse word, thereby taking His Name in vain...until now. WHY???!!! Why did you have to screw up in this regard, Disney? God saith in His Holy Word, \\"Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain.\\" AND WHAT WAS IT WITH THE STREAM OF URINE?!!! That visual, while avoiding nudity, was very, very, very crude and unneccessary. I am so disappointed in Walt Disney Pictures for producing a movie with these two elements in it, two horrible firsts for a company founded in the 1920's on solid family-friendly entertainment. This is my main beef with the film.<br /><br />Such a pity that we might never see a sequel or sequels to this movie due to it being a box-office bomb. And you might want to keep young children away from this film due to the strong religious profanity and the disgusting visual I mentioned that occurs early in the film.<br /><br />Walter Elias Disney would be ashamed that the company he founded made a movie that includes a religious profanity and a nauseating, though brief, visual of a man urinating.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is a great show that really has great acting, a great plot, and an amazing storyline.  This series is very good and the fact that it is trying to stay close to the book storyline is pretty impressive.  Also the fact that they keep adding more and more characters, just as in the books, is a pretty nice change compared to your average sitcom style show.  Also, the way this fictional world is portrayed with the set designs and costumes is also detailed in making the world the show is set in very believable.  I can't wait for season 3 and also have season 1 on Blu-ray as well.  Almost considered getting HBO just to watch this show instead of having to watch it from a friend's house.<br /><br />People also need to realize that this is an adult themed show for mature audiences and that is why it is on HBO.

B00BP0MF7K|5.0|I loved this book. It was a great story. It's about a husband and wife in the UK and their individual relationships with their son David. Harold & his wife feel he never lived up to David's expectations. His marriage is stale, he does the same thing day in and day out. One day a letter arrives from a old work mate--she's dying and has written to say goodbye to Harold whom she has not seen in years.<br /><br />Harold finds inspiration when he goes for a walk to post a letter to Queenie in hospice. He decides that he will walk to see Queenie and that by doing so she will live.<br /><br />This book was really enjoyable. I don't want to give too much away but I found it very inspiring.
0439023491|5.0|AMAZING BOOK!!! I read through this book so quickly its a good thing I had the third book on hand. This is definitely my favorite of the trilogy! A MUST READ!!
1401324649|1.0|Ok, I heard so much about this book, I bought 2 copies one for me and one as a gift. It started out promising--first 10 pages and then I was TOTALLY lost. I don't know why it's gotten such great reviews?? I found I didn't connect with the characters at all and found the book very boring as I got further into it. Unfortunately, I didn't even finish reading it....hate it when that happens. Sorry, wasn't for me at all.

0756404746|5.0|The world, characters, and plot developed by Rothfuss are so engrossing and convincing that I've come to believe the book and legend of Kvothe is its own living essence. You are right there with Kvothe in all his triumphs and sorrows. I love Rothfuss's writing style of providing brilliant and vibrant detail on every page. His writing is like artwork. I also love the many philosophical thoughts we see Kvothe having throughout the book.<br /><br />I have never read a whole lot of fantasy, but this book resonates with me on many levels. It may not be the same for you but I sure am glad I gave it a shot!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|It's more Hollywood than the series, but then it has to be right?  I read that the fans resurrected the show and then I saw the movie and I knew what that means.  I loved the series, but since it was cancelled, it ends abruptly.  The movie wraps things up nicely.  I would suggest that the movie was really meant for the fans, because if you hadn't seen the series, you may not understand it.  The movie goes into more depth on a few things and brings the story to a close.
B00B3EVNEE|4.0|I've always liked Robin Trower's style.  This is a more straight up blues album and It's really good musically and production wise.  Buy it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book, it is so well written and the story just grabs you from the beginning. A must read for anyone who loves great science fiction, and great stories.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I found this show sometime during season 2 and was immediately hooked. The pacing is such that the 50 minutes or so each episode lasts seems closer to about 15 minutes. You're given a sizable collection of characters, the vast majority of whom are flawed, to follow as they attempt to manage the crime in the town of Farmington, CA. The show is able to maintain its hi-octane output because it rarely pauses between problems between the police and crooks, as soon ans one thing is seemingly tied off, it created another two, bigger, problems. The show is also hell-bent at times on bringing as much shock to the screen as possible. So, if you're not into darker story lines, then you may find the show off-putting.<br /><br />This show is, for me, is better than The Wire, which certainly deserves all the praise it has gotten.

0553386794|5.0|Without really have to divulge this knowledge, this book and each subsequent novels are long and only get longer. I felt the only way for me to finish this book in a timely manner was to read and listen to it on audiobook while driving, which I do so much of (the driving that is). In the span of seven business days I found myself saying `mission accomplished' and `holy crap' in quick succession.<br /> Attention to detail - Almost every character is beyond intense. They are carefully crafted, and the perspective shift ensures that the story never dulls. With different houses owing fealty or allegiance to another, and all of their colors and outfits, and crests, and seals, and sigils, and house words, etc. How he kept everything sorted out, is almost beyond me. From what I've heard (cause I didn't keep count) there were almost 300 characters introduced in this first installment.<br /> Knowing the characters - Excluding just a few individuals, the thing that I find interesting is that some of the people within this world can do such horrible things, things that make you want to hate them eternally. Then you will hear a backstory of that character, and next thing you know you feel slightly sorry for the person, and you begin to question why you hated them so much to begin with? It's because they seem so human in their nature. In my opinion so far in the series,  besides three characters in the book (Joffrey, Arya, Jon Snow) none is wholly good and none are completely bad.<br /> Keeping it together - I will say that the one way to make sense of all the chaos and names, and alliances, my strongest urge is that if anyone is planning on reading the books, watch season one first. It may be necessary to watch season two as well, but by watching the show before undertaking the novels it really helped give a face to each name and also really cement their relationships to other characters. I think that without that little crutch I would not have been able to keep everything straight in my mind.<br /> In finishing this behemoth, I will move on to the next novel, but have other concerns. George R. R. Martin isn't really a Danielle Steele, and he doesn't churn out a book every month. The difference his books are good, and take time. However, the length of time is what troubles me. Spending 4-5 years on each book is a bit long and if I finish all of the books this year, I would still have to wait up to 10 years to see the conclusion of this saga. With that being said, you can see how remembering almost or over 6000 pages of prior novels could become cumbersome to attempt to recollect and pick up again.<br /> Still I do look forward to the next novels and the future TV series.  I give GoT a solid 5 stars even though there are many repeated phrases throughout the book that at times can get old, but I can forgive all the mentions of boiled leather, chain mail, seven hells, etc, because, well it is a huge damn book and how can you not be forced to repeat  things. Overall, it is a well-crafted world and I found myself wanting more when it was over.<br /><br />P.S. - Don't die early George!ight in my mind.<br /> In finishing this behemoth, I will move on to the next novel, but have other concerns.

B004GUSG4M|4.0|I had never heard of this book before reading a brief snippet about it on the &#34;book a day&#34; calendar that I picked up at Books a Million at Christmas time.  What a pleasant surprise!  The basic concept of the story is that the main character, Christine, wakes up every morning with no memory of the day before - or, in fact, of any days before.  The man in the bed next to her is a stranger (so every morning he has to remind her that he's her husband).  As a result of a traumatic injury (which is eventually explained), decades of Christine's life have vanished from her memory.  The book tells the story of how she works to preserve, from one day to the next, what memories she manages to retrieve.  What makes it even more interesting is that Christine has reason to question what she finds in her journal, in her own handwriting.
B0085OEU1I|5.0|Love this movie.  I've seen it quite a few times and it seems to get better each and every time.  I had to write a paper over a musical for my Music Appreciation class and this was my first choice.  Enjoyed the movie so much and got an A on my paper, couldn't ask for more!
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I had to update my review. I had a few weeks of fun but after a while, it became obvious that the game was pushing me into making in-app purchases and recruiting friends to play the game via Facebook, etc. Plus the game started dropping stuff I had spent a while building - things just disappeared, and then finally, one of the ponies I bought just disappeared. I put the game down and haven't looked back.

I could watch this again and again.  Ready for parts 2 and 3!

1601254679|5.0|\\"NPC Codex\\" by Jason Bulmahn & friends, published and distributed by Paizo Publishing.<br /><br />The very short introduction tells you how to use this book, and gives info on how the stats blocks will be laid out.<br /><br />Part One, \\"Core Classes\\", breaks down each of the 11 Core Rulebook character classes into 20 examples, one for each level.  Some of them might make for good friends of the player characters, and some of them are better off as villains plotting against the players.  In any case, there are still plenty that are just plain NPC's that can be used in your game.  There's also the nice feature of being able to find out what each character class is capable of at =every= level.  From Barbarians to Wizards, there are portraits of each, and at least the same basic info you'd find in a Bestiary.<br /><br />Part Two, \\"Prestige Classes\\", covers the 10 Core Rulebook Prestige Classes, with four good examples of each, from Arcane Archers to Shadowdancers.  Each has a character name and a short description of who they are, what to expect if in combat, and role-playing suggestions.  The major differences between each character point out that there is a wide diversity of choices for each class.<br /><br />Part Three, \\"NPC Classes\\", only has the five Core Rulebook examples, but the 10 of each gives GM's many prospective city or country inhabitants.  They would also make for fine allies, friends, or enemies.  There are 10 example levels for each class.  From the first level Adept to the 10th level Warrior, these characters can help to really flesh out a world.<br /><br />Part Four, \\"Iconic Characters\\", studies the same 11 core classes as part one, but instead of making each one different, this book assigns a single character per class.  For instance, we follow Amiri the Barbarian as she advances from 1st level to 12th level, with stats for 1st level, 7th level, and 12th level.  This was my personal favorite section, as it shows offensive abilities, defensive abilities, tactics, and a stat block.  This shows how a single character can develop.<br /><br />There are three appendices: Animal Companions, Encounter Groups, and a class feature index.  The Animal Companion section details possible Druid and/or Ranger animal friends, and even how they might level up themselves.  The Encounter Groups section breaks down various bands of NPC's at low level, mid-level, and high level.  Great for that random encounter.  The Class Features section is merely an index to where the various features can be found.  There's also an index.<br /><br />I'll start off by saying that originally I was not planning on purchasing a hardcover version of this book.  I usually take my laptop to gaming sessions that I run, and the fine Paizo PDF of this book was all I thought I needed.  But the PDF convinced me that the hardcover version was useful - especially when planning the next adventure at home.  I would like to urge Pathfinder GM's still sitting on the fence trying to decide if they want one to take a look at one and see what a great job Paizo is still doing, especially with their hardcovers.<br /><br />Highly Recommended - especially for GM's.es, tactics, and a stat block.

1616202416|4.0|Purple Hibiscus is a beautiful story written by the extremely talented, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Surprisingly, Purple Hibiscus was Adichie's first book published and I am very impressed by how well written and enjoyable it is. The characters are intriguing and complex. I have read a few other novels by Adichie that include The Thing Around Your Neck, but Purple Hibiscus has easily won my heart between the two.<br /><br />The story revolves around the main character Kambili Achike, a fourteen-year-old girl that is raised in an abusive environment. Her father is seen as a raging tyrant and often times is vicious toward Kambili, her brother Jaja, and her mother. The novel is set in postcolonial Nigeria, which is known for it's political instability and economic difficulties, which I view as something that foreshadows the volatility of the Achike household.<br /><br />A major component of the novel is Kambili's lack of self-identity. She is an interesting individual who is faced with many different hardships and seeks knowledge and understanding of the world around her through many things including her education. She is very clearly driven by fear and therefore is many times misunderstood by her peers. Throughout the course of the novel, Kambili learns how to become an independent woman through the support of her Aunt Ifeoma, Amaka, and Father Amadi. In my eyes, this drastic change in Kambili proves Purple Hibiscus to be representational a coming to age story.<br /><br />Jaja is another interesting character. Judging by how difficult his upbringing is, I can understand how the hardships he endures greatly affect his life. He seems to be a more headstrong and outspoken person in comparison to his sister, Kambili and this was evident when he opted not to attend the Communion on Palm Sunday. He went against his father's wishes, which is a major turning point in the novel for the Achike family. Jaja's decision to go against his fathers wishes has often been referred to as\\"the beginning of the end\\" for their family.<br /><br />Although there are many complex characters within the novel, I feel that the most important and influential character of the book is Eugene- Kambili and Jaja's father. He plays a vital role in the novel and his actions determine a significant amount of events that occur in the book. When Eugene feels as though an act by one of his family members is immoral or does not meet his expectations, he rebels against them in violent ways.  For example, when Beatrice does not wish to visit with Father Benedict because she is ill, Eugene chooses to beat her. Not only does Eugene beat his wife but he also beats his children. When I say beaten, this doesn't mean that he just slaps them around, this means that he goes to the extent of poring boiling water on Kambili and Jaja's feet as well as kicking Kambili until she needs to be hospitalized. Eugene wants to have a family with positive morals and goals, however, his actions are quite hypocritical if you ask me. Although he says his motives are for his family's own good, I think he is a lying, deceiving, and immoral tyrant.<br /><br />As previously stated, I really liked Purple Hibiscus. The themes of Domestic Violence, Colonialism, and Nigerian Politics were interesting to read about because I was able to compare them to a great deal of works I have previously read including those of Franz Fanon and the novella and film, Xala. I think the novel would have benefitted from Adichie digging a bit deeper and expressing more feeling throughout the novel, however, I did take away a lot from the experience of reading Purple Hibiscus and would most definitely recommend it to those interested in any of the themes mentioned above.

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Had already heard suit and tie.. thought it was eh. Still, curiosity won and I bought the album. Popped it in as I started a long drive to a work meeting. The cd is excellent. I can see how hearing any of the songs on its own - isolated - for the first time wouldn't leave a great impression. But listening to the cd start to finish was a real experience. I'm surprised to say it but I love it! Great album.

0307750922|5.0|My usual five stars for my favorite character.  Being without Jack Reacher is like being without ice cream or chocolate.  This book was no exception.  How one character can get involved in so much is amazing.  And with only a toothbrush he does a darn good job of seeing the country.  Sometimes I do wonder why he doesn't have a change of clothes but at least he does wash the one outfit he has.  This is a very good story and I wait patiently for the next.

B00177YA1K|4.0|This is the first Men in Black movie based on Lowell Cunningham's comic book. It's an origin story with Will Smith playing a police officer who joins the Men in Black. Agent J(Smith) and Agent K(Tommy Lee Jones) hunt a deadly space alien who is after \\"the galaxy on Orion's belt\\". This movie spawned a Men in Black cartoon that aired on Kids WB from 1997-2001. Men in Black is action packed, violent, disgusting, and funny. It was a big critical and commercial hit during the Summer of 1997.<br />The music score by Danny Elfman is good and there's some first rate special effects.  Men in Black is also a short, breezy film. It barely reached 80 minutes. Addams Family director Barry Sonnenfeld directed all three MIB films. Men in Black(1997) is a fun science fiction comedy.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|This is a fun game.But the ads have become very intrusive and relentless.They not only pop up between every attempt to clear a level, now they pop up interfering with game play-repeatedly.This is really irritating when you are finally close to clearing a level and you have to start over.Even if you download whatever they are pushing the ads keep coming.
B0049IHX2C|3.0|Men in Black II(2002) is a decent sequel. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones somehow keep their cool with a flawed script. The film's climax was changed after the September 11th attack in 2001. Agents J and K have to stop a shape shifting alien woman(Lara Flynn Boyle) from getting her hands on \\"The Light\\". Frank the Pug and the Worm Guys are given larger roles! The humor in Men in Black II is more slapstick driven than the first film. Johnny Knoxville, Rip Torn and Rosario Dawson co-star. The late Michael Jackson made a cameo in the film as an MIB agent. The music score by Danny Elfman is good. The \\"neuralizer sound effect\\" has been enhanced in this film. The visual effects for the flying saucers are decent. It's amazing Men in Black II turned out as well as it did considering the chaos at the time. It also had to compete at the box office with the first Spiderman movie in 2002. MIB II is worth a rental.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|If you are looking for a FREE Bible and alot of versions to it (i.e. NIV, King James, etc)...this is the best Bible I have found!<br />I just downloaded it to my IPad last night and it works perfectly. It even has AUDIO, something that I need when I get tired of reading.<br /><br />I have tried other downloads for my Galaxy and the other downloads either 1) never worked or 2) took too long to download. This free Holy Bible does not take long to download and it is easy to read.<br /><br />Give it a try and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
0425241505|5.0|Such a unique book, especially when everyone else is writing about vampires and werewolfs.  It has a little bit of everything; paranormal, magic, romance, suspence, and mystery.  It is also really well written; with a magical world that makes sense and filled with memorable characters.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!

B00BSBY38A|5.0|A very emotional, beautiful movie. Great story. Spend the extra buck for HD, it's worth it. Probably in my top ten. Richard Parker!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|i love this game! i enjoy watching the dragons, however,i dislike his expensive everything is! you also need a lot of patience on this game.
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|On my Acer iconia a500, it downloads then during install, says there is an error and ask to retry, which means another 500 megs to download. Gave up after 4 times. Please fix.<br /><br />Addendum:<br />Somehow, I figured that it had something to do with the SD card (on the A500, Acer does not allow you to install apps on the SD in the hope, I guess, to force you to buy the 32 gig model). So I removed the SD card, redownloaded the game and it worked. No problems after that). No problem either to download and run from Droid DNA.<br /><br />As stated by other players, it's Skyrim in your pocket. Graphics on the DNA are simply astounding.
B000FC12YQ|2.0|I am a die hard Christie fan but I was surprised by how easy it was to guess the killer. Very dissapointing end to an otherwise great novel.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Once I began reading this book, I simply could not find enough hours in the day to devote to it's pages. In depth and well analyzed account of not only President Lincoln, but of all those who played an important role in his life. Highly Recommend.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I an skeptical about replacing my DVD's with blu rays unless I see there is some real positive difference. So far, this set blows me away. I do not care about the flimsy plastic outer case because the inner cases provide more than enough protection. EVERYTHING here, has been cleaned up frame by frame and the sound re-mastered in 7.1 which still is awesone in 5.1. Every scratch, nick and flaw has been eliminated. In addition, they have added additional CGI mini-shots which only enhance the overall quality. Normally I am a purist when it comes to such things but these are very small changes and make the overall experience so much more than it ever was. To quote the producers, the Odudas, &#34;we have made it the way Roddenbery world have if he had the technology back then&#34;. Well worth every penny and especially now that the price has dropped so dramatically. I am watching this on a Sony 46 inch LED set in the bedroom and cannot wait to see it on a 70 inch LED if I could ever afford the new set.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn has done it again. This novel works until the very last chapter. The side ending is sort of disappointing.
B005CVWWJY|3.0|Well written but the main character was just too perfect. Even his flaws were made to just reinforce his greatness. The character had all the answers and just happened to have all the right skills.  An enjoyable read but I found myself gagging at the characters seemingly perfect knowledge of 80's pop culture that was all explained away by simply saying I had made an extensive study of xyz.
0345529057|5.0|Watched the series, then downloaded the ebooks, which is great for travel and all, but I just like physical copies better. I usually hate paperbacks, because they get busted up so easily, but it's so cheap for the first four books! Definitely great starting point if you want to get into the series.<br /><br />I saw some comments about how it's good to get if you're an experienced fantasy reader, and let me just say that that statement isn't necessarily true. The only fantasy series I've ever read was Harry Potter, which is more of a gateway series, since it's written for a younger audience, but I immediately fell in love with A Song of Ice and Fire. Excellent deal for an excellent series. In the middle of book two right now and can't wait to finish!
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is one great retro game. It has provided me with hours of enjoyment. You should get this game. You will not regret it.
B0089OBLDO|1.0|it doesn't work - Connected it to the X-BOX360 as directed but it didn't produce the desire results.  We were unable to use the PS3 Steering Wheel and other  games we had hoped to be able to use.  Had to return.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If you loved season one, season 2 doesn't disappoint! Creppier than ever Asylum was amazing! Really hoping they come back with season 3. BTW, it has nothing to do with season 1. Just so you don't think you have to catch season 1 to watch season 2.
0307592731|2.0|Self indulgent and boring. Had to force myself to finish book and couldn't sympathize with character. Also a little skeptical of accuracy- this was written significantly later after the hike and contains lots of detail but author doesn't mention a diary or any notes.
B005PK553C|5.0|What an amazing show! If you like horror story's, this is exactly what you get with this show! The cast does such an amazing job! It's creepy and i just can't get enough! I bought the whole season!
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|I have been looking forward to this film since it was announced Jackson was taking over as director.  Having never read the Hobbit I never quite bonded with the characters in the beginning-no development to speak of except Prince.  I still do not know all the dwarves names, but I am sure I will watch this again so hopefully I will pick that up.  Personally, everything about the Lord of the Rings was magic due to the magnificent cast.  Unfortunately, the cast of this film was mediocre at best . . . sorry to say that with the exception of the marvelous reprisals of Rings characters by the respective actors in those two scenes-not enough of these actors storyline or not.  There were moments of brilliance-the rescue scene, Smeagol and Bilbo's riddle game immediately come to mind.  Photography was excellent throughout, but I do not like the new camera-seemed way too bright and did not have the rich depth of color as other films.  I still give it four stars and will likely buy the extended version when it comes available.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Apparently it's  great series and I'm looking forward to watching it.  It arrived promptly and the quality is good to excellent.

B0031RAOW8|5.0|This movie shows how loyal a dog can be and the bond that is shared between a dog and his master.  I cried for like the last half hour. Even though tge movie is incredibky sad it is worth it to watch.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The humor in this movie was fantastic. Familiar story line with a funny twist that definitely kept us rolling through the entire show. Loved it.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Not worth bothering with.  The story line doesn't flow . It feels like a series of block events with very little connection. Plot devices are too contrived. The author should have taken more time to allow the characters to develop.

I repeat IT IS VERY INTENSE. the first time doing this workout, I wanted to kick my foot through the tv screen. Jillian Michaels created a method of training that is more productive than spending 3 hours at the gym. 20 minutes with her will have you saying \\"gym who\\"??

B00005Y7NK|1.0|I'll keep this short and sour, this album blows. Martins vocal headache inducing shrieks get on my nerves and his lyrics are as embarrassing as his voice is unpleasant. Quite an accomplishment. Cozy Powell while a solid drummer never rises above indistinct and the bassist may as well not even have been playing. Perhaps he used the Black Metal bass pedal which is audible only to those who are trve kvlt? Of course that pedal may not have been available when this album was recorded. Iommi's riffs are more hair metal than heavy metal (with a few exceptions) and are completely inappropriate to the lyrical content. Which, while dark, is less sophisticated than bottom shelf black metal fantasy. At least Dio's lyrics, while sometimes idiotic, usually made no sense so weren't quite as silly or embarrassing.  Martin's, however, are distinct and satan is mentioned in every song. Geezer where are you? There's nothing real, sincere or artful about any of Headless Cross, not the music, not the lyrics. All the listener is left with is contrived product. After Dio left (the first time) this band rarely delivers and this time they sound like they didn't really try. Pathetic.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I got this game as FAOTD, but after playing it for a few minutes I would definitely be willing to pay full price! This game boasts awesome old-school graphics and hours of fun and entertaining gameplay. It's just an all-around cool game. Get it.
B0060MYM3S|3.0|yep ... that is what sums it up in a nutshell. Set your expectations a little lower for this season.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy might look excessive but for a little more than $20 it's well worth it.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|I found \\"Argo\\" tedious. Affleck largely underplayed his part or perhaps played it in \\"director mode.\\" He should have chosen between playing the lead and directing. There are few who are talented enough to do both well. Not until the tense scene at the end, when the fleeing \\"cast\\" almost misses their plane, did the movie gather some steam. But by then, if I hadn't paid to rent the movie, I would have already abandoned it.<br /><br />As one who is old enough to remember the Iran hostage crisis, I was haunted by the fate of the hostages who were captured and held for so long by the Iranians. The story of \\"Argo\\" seemed inconsequential in comparison. The hostage crisis itself would make better subject matter for a film.

B00BNWWVFG|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Steven Soderbergh's 'Side Effects', first appears as if it's designed as a critique of psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry. Ultimately, it becomes more like a Hitchcock thriller. It's a film that keeps your interest but you'll have to suspend your disbelief quite a bit, to appreciate it.<br /><br />Rooney Mara (looking quite more appealing than her stint as angry Goth in 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'), plays Emily Taylor, a seemingly depressed wife of her husband Martin (Channing Tatum), who has just come home after doing four years in prison for insider trading.<br /><br />When it appears that she tries to kill herself by slamming her car into a wall in a parking garage, she's assigned to a psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Banks (winningly played by Jude Law). Banks is a fairly typical psychiatrist who prescribes one psychotropic medication after another, hoping that Emily's mood will change. Still feeling forlorn, Banks consults with Emily's former psychiatrist, Victoria (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who recommends that Emily be placed on a new experimental drug, Ablixa. Banks takes the pharmaceutical company's money and convinces Emily to participate in the study.<br /><br />The stakes are raised when seemingly despondent Emily stabs husband Martin to death but claims she can't remember anything and blames everything on the Ablixa. Suddenly, Banks is no longer the complacent psychiatrist but is now a scapegoat, as the press blames him for dispensing the medication which everyone assumes is the cause of Emily's violent outburst. His patients start leaving him in droves and he's investigated by the State Licensing Board. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical company drops him as one of the testers of the Ablixa study.<br /><br />Soon, Banks figures out that there's something much more sinister underfoot. Like Hitchcock's 'Wrong Man', he now must clear his name. As Emily has taken a plea bargain in which she pleads guilty by reason of insanity, Banks is assigned to be her psychiatrist at the Ward's Island Criminal Psychiatric facility, and has full say as to whether she will be eventually released or not. And here is where I had the biggest problem with this film. If Banks' reputation is so in tatters (he's been smeared in the press) and the state licensing board is investigating him, why would the court even entertain the idea that he should continue to be involved with Emily? And without this caveat, the film's denouement, could never develop as it does.<br /><br />So let's suspend our disbelief over this major plot point and see whether the rest of 'Side Effects' has any more credibility. As it turns out, Banks does indeed figure out that Emily was faking all along that she was depressed. He also discovers that Banks turned out to be the former lover of her former psychiatrist, Victoria, who convinces Emily to participate in an incredible scheme to drive the stock price down of pharmaceutical company who's been promoting Ablixa. By selling short, Emily and Victoria end up making a bundle but once Banks figures everything out, he forces Emily to wear a wire and rat out Victoria.<br /><br />It's pretty much a fantastic scheme and again it involves more suspension of disbelief, since it's not guaranteed that the stock price will go down that much, where the two schemers, will actually make a big profit. Nonetheless, it could remotely happen. Banks being in cahoots with the Assistant District Atttorney to turn Emily but then falsifying her personality profile and illegally ordering her to take mind numbing psychotropic medications such as Thorazine, to shut up her up, seems beyond the pale. Would an ADA risk his job to participate in such an illegal, revenge scheme? I hardly think so.<br /><br />It's also a bit ironic that a psychiatrist who exceeds his authority by authorizing the administration of psychotropic medications when they are not needed, appears justified, since the patient in question, has gotten away with murder. Whether you like this final scenario or not, one wonders why Emily didn't have an attorney who could have worked to expose Banks' illegal actions. It just seemed a little too easy in the way that Banks, along with his allies, so easily were able to keep Emily as a zombie (all doped up with her medications), without any other third parties becoming involved in her case, and perhaps discovering that the 'good guys' (i.e. Banks and company), were suddenly doing a bunch of bad things.<br /><br />'Side Effects' is a passable 'Hollywood-type' thriller. It has the requisite good acting and interesting plot reversals, but ultimately not everything adds up.t in question, has gotten away with murder.

B00A0MJA1I|5.0|The above heading is obviously subjective, but this has been my opinion of the film since I first saw it in the early 1950's.  I purchased it at this time for our grandson.  He thoroughly enjoys it.  The whole pirate, sword fight thing is espeically appealing to him.  Thanks!
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I ordered this video yesterday, downloaded it on my Kindle Fire HD and started to watch it while I was flying home to Los Angeles. Flight attendant told us to power down our electrical equipment when I was half way thru so I knew - no worries, I'll finish watch it the next morning.<br /><br />When I tried to click onto the video the only option available to click on was for &#34;Watch the trailer&#34;.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME! VERY DISAPPOINTED. Can I not be allowed to finish seeing a file I started to view? To be clear - the movie was good (what I saw). The delivery system was flawed.

B00425S1H8|5.0|I needed to have my older dot matrix serial check printer work on my newly purchased Lenovo Windows 8 machine. I first purchased the lowest cost USB to serial adapter that I could find on Ebay. After a good bit of debugging and downloading, I was unable to locate a driver that would work.<br /><br />I paid the extra amount for this unit (with the Prolific PL230HX Rev D Chipset), and had it and my old accounting software printing in no time. The unit came with a CD which had the appropriate driver for Windows 8. Overall, a great experience!

B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I love the look of this app. But I can't read the text! The font is terribly tiny an  you can't change  it. Gets an immediate uninstall since I can't even read it, no matter how useful it may be. Good thing I tried this on a free app day.
B00AO7HQ06|4.0|I've had the opportunity to listen to this set on a better audio system. The mastering is fine, up to the limits that 16 bit CDs allow. This is a worthy investment for Duane fan-addicts and guitarists interested in his evolution as an artist. For the more casual Duane/Allman Brothers fan, a collection of their well mastered albums would suffice.<br /><br />Much money, time, and well intentioned effort went into this release. If the demand is there, the initial release of 10,000 will probably be expanded. This music will really shine in higher resolution: vinyl, Blu-ray, SACD, HD downloads. Eventually, perhaps licensed to MOFI or Steve Hoffman.<br /><br />A bit costly for 7 redbook CDs, and eco-minimalist packaging, but true Skydog fans will treasure the retrospective.

1451695187|4.0|Unique NDE story in that the author is a doctor. Fact is, his &#34;proof&#34; is proof to me because I am a believer, but those who do not believe will never accept anyone's story of proof of life after death, no matter what. They will just say it is made up by someone trying to convince the non-believers regardless of the teller's credentials. But this book reconfirmed by belief and reassures me that my deceased daughter lives on in a much better place.

B004VYYA2K|5.0|This is super cute storage for my daughters Barbies! She has limited space in her room so she cant fit a traditional barbie house.this transforms into a really cute room! Its been a lot of fun for her.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Have played many times on PC,  this is a great port to Android.  Lots of fun.  FOATD to boot!  Like the star ratings for each level played.
0525950079|5.0|What a world Follett builds again. You do wish the book would never end. The whole reading family loves this book.as much as its predecessor..
B00BWJARHO|3.0|This movie was okay, but far from great. It was woefully padded, and seemed to drag on and on and on. I don't care how much money Peter Jackson made, his films is overlong and over indulgent. This movie could easily be pared down by at least 1/3 of the run time.<br /><br />Also, I never got to finish the movie. I had to pause it about 2/3rds of the way through to take a phone call. When I returned Amazon had flagged it as Content Unavailable, so I never saw the remaining hour or so. Amazon was kind enough to refund the rental fee, but instead of re-renting The Hobbit for the ending, I used the refund to view a different film, which I enjoyed more.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Harold is a sad, determined man that the reader will truly love.  The people he meets on his pilgrimage have good intentions and hearts and the reader will unintentionally cheer Harold on his trek, all the while hoping his long suffering wife will do the same.  He is a man on a mission and I would recommend readers join Harold on his journey.  You won't be disappointed.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is addictive! I cant stop playing. None of my house chores are getting done. At this rate my fiance will have to compete against this game. So far the game is winning.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A really good story.  The reader will fluctuate on who is the real culprit throughout the entire story and for good reason; one has no idea until the end.  Flynn is a good story teller who makes the characters come to life.  Highly recommend.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Wonderful depiction of how the upper class lived in a different era. Many ups and downs; high points and low ones.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This story about a young journalist who is sent to her hometown to report on the disappearance of two little girls, delves into the sad and painful history of her childhood and the reason why she carves words into her flesh.  The reader will immensely dislike her mother and will want to throttle her spoiled-rotten little sister.  The end will surprise the reader and I recommend it as a good thriller.
B005T87QCI|4.0|hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hih can you create your own rrobot plz answers
B0027MJU00|4.0|Flynn is a good writer and her characters are either sympathetic or evil, in that you either love them or hate them.  This story is intense and a page-turner and was well written.  If you like a good thriller, you will like &#34;Dark Places&#34;.  I would recommend it.
0143034901|5.0|Plot has lots of twists and turns but is very enganging and the author brings it all together at the end.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|Very touching movie to see how Christ died for our sins. The movie comes with quite a few in depth spiritual details as well.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|I'm trying to upcycle as much as can, because I like making things out of things that would otherwise be thrown away. This bottle cutter is simple and does the trick. It took me several tries to get it right, but with a little practice I started making nice clean cuts. It's more like controlled breakage than cutting, really.
B008476HBM|5.0|this is one of my favorite books, I will read it over and over again.  Reading on the paperwhite is easier than an old nook.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I'd made the jump to feedly long before Google announced that they weren't going to continue with their RSS reader.<br />The magazine style format is very user friendly, making it easy & fun to keep track of my favourite feeds & blogs.<br />Love it!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|When you own a kindle fire and want to add a better browser onto it, this is a product that you will definitely need. It is easy to install and transfer products over (like the Dolphin browser) and I had no troubles afterward. Great for what it does.
0345803485|3.0|i gave this book as a gift and was willing to give the person the following ones, but he didn't want them since he told me it was ok but not good enough to read the others.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|Pre-chrome coming out with an app for Android, this was one of the best browsers for me to use on my phone. I liked the pre-set speed dial sense that it came with and the browser did not eat up a lot of my battery.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is very good to know exactly how much time I have for everything and the best part is that it's free. The only thing I found a little annoying was that every time I plug my  kindle in the app pops up and sometimes it interrupted my games but other than that it was very good
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I am not sure why facebook would release such a horrible quality product and claim that it is stable. All this does for me is crash or say that it cannot find certain locations. When I am trying to check-in somewhere, it tells me I am three states away!! That is even with the location enabled.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading!!! Amazing!!! Didn't think I'd like these stories but I have fallen and can't wait to read the third book. :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game I just think you should upgrade it so that it will let u use it at a good time in the game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is my second of these watches, the last made it about  1 1/2 years of almost continuous use. I work on an oil rig, and have to have watches with non metal bands at work. Found this style so light and comfortable, that I tend to wear it at home also. Paid $55 for this watch, best price around and well worth it. I can't say the same for Seiko's watch center though, whatever happened to previous (stopped working, no damage to watch on exterior at all) the watch repair center wanted twice the cost of this watch to repair it.
B00486UF52|5.0|a lot of insight that will help anyone figuring out how the English think, how they act and how to treat them!<br />MUST READ if moving to UK
B000641Z90|5.0|Love the DVD, only wish I could have gotten it on CD to listen in my car.......I would recomend this to an one....
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Keep in mind that this is a smart phone/tablet which is the reason to say like mostly everybody that the graphics of this game are impressive for the CPU/GPU power of these devices. Once you played the game you can notice that the tesallation of this game is similar or better to a black XBOX but textures, lighting, bloom, particles I mean everything related to shadders is what you can find in advanced opengl games.<br /><br />For 99 cents you get way better campaign than CoD or BF series in your pocket and depending on your device you get also great multiplayer. I have it installed on a HTC 3D evo and Archos G9 80 which performs very good. Obviously I like it better in my tablet but with 9 inches of screen you most likely will need to make adjustments to your HUD.<br /><br />I will eventually hook my tablet to one of my monitors of TVs because this game is really worthy. Also sound is in may ways better modern pc shooters. People argue about this game being a copy of COD but regardless is a very well design game. I also hope that bluestacks  will get stable enough to have this game running on my PC and see if I can get any performance improvement. Althought that could not happen since most of Android Apps runs based on Java visualization rather than hardware specific.<br /><br />I really do not know what is going to happen with Microsoft or game developers like Infinityward when Android (which is Linux after all) get to the PC fully integrated. Either they get into a different business/model or<br /><br />Bye, bye to both.
0784010528|5.0|This is an awesome movie, I can watch it over and over and I never get sick of it. Val Kilmer makes a great Jim Morrison
B007Q1GJA6|5.0|This movie is sooooo funny!!!!!!!!  Love it!!!! Buy it!!!!!  could watch over and over....got it for my husband and he loves it!!!!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a fascinating read. This book was a real page turner-hard to put down. I would recommend this book.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Making is awesome. Nice graphics and setup.  Great free kindle fire app. Lots of levels, should keep you busy for a good while.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i love the game, but I wish there weren't so many ads in it though n n n n n
B009LHWEKW|5.0|THIS SERIES IS THE BEST ONE I HAVE EVER SEEN. FROM THE ACTION TO THE LOVE THE TWO BROTHERS HAVE. ALL AROUND A GREAT SERIES
B009KEN87O|5.0|Rad+Addictive  =  RADDICTIVE  a radically addictive game melding antiquated graphics and simplified gameplay  reminiscent of early 80s machinations yet refreshingly pure
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|For the first time I wished for a larger screen; the visuals are stunning, the story provocative. Ang Lee continues to impress.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|AMAZING MOVIE GREAT QUALITY! THIS MOVIE COMPLETELY BLEW MY MIND THIS KIDS ARE SO AMAZING!! HOPE FOR A SECOND ONE
1250012570|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Rainbow Rowell. I absolutely loved her debut novel \\"Attachments\\". I have been waiting for what seems like forever for \\"Eleanor & Park\\". I had actually pre-ordered it, and then out of the blue won an ARC in a contest. I stalled as much as possible before starting this book because I'm a fast reader and wanted to savor it. However, I have no willpower (or self-respect) and devoured it in one sitting. I flat-out loved it. It was funny, sad, uplifting and heartbreaking all at once. Eleanor and Park are misfit high school students in the mid-eighties who manage to find each other. Eleanor's home life is atrocious, and her school days aren't much better. With Park, she finds love and acceptance. The best thing about this book was that it rang so true. I was in high school in this time period, and the novel brought back so many memories (that gym suit!) good and bad. So now, here I am, once again waiting breathlessly for Rainbow's next book.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I like most everything about this game except for the moronic gold requirements. really? you have to spend 80 bucks just to get three of the base dragons lameness to a level of stupid. at the rate I'm going I might get a magic dragon in a year or two. stupid greedy designer's
B0013527I4|5.0|We have all three of the seasons they released on DVD. My 2-year-old loves the Muppets and Roger Miller, so we had to get this season.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|i had only heard about this movie through the grapevine and without much detail. Initially I thought it was going to be a silly movie. this was a GREAT movie. well written and a tribute to humanity and they things we sometimes take for granted in life can be monumental accomplishments for others<br />i would pay to watch this one again!
B0065NAKRO|5.0|Love it.<br />No problems at all. Great design and choice of games. Easy to see. Good size. Strongly recommend if you like dominoes
B00BSBY38A|3.0|this was a cool movie for about 40 minutes. the animation is just ok and not sure why there was so much hype. i wont watch again even if free :(
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The book continues on where book one left off, with the characters aged a bit.  Historical data seemed accurate with a great story wound around them.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Ex-CIA agent Liam Neesom has to recover a kidnapped young woman who will end up in the White Slavery trade in 96 hours.  Well done but it is an adult show with torture, shootings and death.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Great Show, Came on time. Also very cheap so didn't spend a lot of money for it! Buy it Cheap!
0307949486|5.0|It is the characters that made this book for me. I found the plot to move a little slowly until the two main characters become acquainted, but after that it moved along quite well. I also found the writing to be a bit more literary than the mainstream, and I like to read a book that focuses on the writing rather than the plot from time to time. By far, however, it is the characterizations that make this book. They are not cookie-cutter by any means. I look forward to reading the next book in the series.
B000I186FW|5.0|V for Vendetta is one of the all time best movies ever made. Beautifully made, exxxcellent story, thought provoking, outstanding cast. If you haven't seen this then what are you waiting for ??
B005K17RU0|4.0|Just like the look and feel of its screen . Information is very well presented . Prompt for outdoor activities is very good
B001GXYBY6|5.0|This is a fun movie. I grew up watching Speed Racer, Astor Boy, and The 8th Man after school. The movie Speed Racer is worth owning just to watch the two races. If car races really were like this, then I would have a front row seat to all of them. I give it 5 stars because of the pure entertainment it provides.
B00AH8FTT2|1.0|It left me very angry! As the 3rd book in the trilogy surely the trilogy is complete. I am 84 years old and will probably never know what happened to the poor boy. Why were we not told there were more books to come?
B009KEN87O|5.0|reminds me of playing space invaders when I was a kid. my daughter loves it when I tell her this is how all games used to be.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Good, quick fun if you enjoy blowing up aliens in space. So if you don't like this game, you're probably an alien.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I play this more than Angry Birds a lot of the times. Most levels are easy to zip through and some are challenging. Plus the wonderful sandbox mode that lets you make your own ideas.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I'm totally in love with Alfie Boe.  Saw him in concert also.  Les Mis is one of my favorite shows.  The entire cast is OUTSTANDING.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This was an amazing book! I like it a little better than the movie and it was pretty different actually.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is really a GREAT book.. I love the way its laid out and it would make an awesome movie. I am on the last 20% and riveted to my seat but bummed because I need to find something after this that equals its entertainment value.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I enjoyed this game more than any other I have played. It held my attention til the end. I highly recommend it to others. I was particularly impressed with the storyline. It was artfully done and showcased Danielle's determination and courage. There wasn't anything she wouldn't do to rescue the man she loved. Kudos to all involved in the production of this story.
0385349947|5.0|Though this book is brand new, it has already proven to be an essential critical set of thoughts on women and men in America.<br /><br />Sandberg notes that writing this book was an unlikely move for her, and that she herself did not identify as a feminist during her university days. Yet, in writing this book, she has now become a core leader for equality.<br /><br />The book speaks humbly and directly. Sandberg's non-anecdotal statements about women in the workplace are backed up with facts and studies from reputable social science journals. Even her anecdotes gain strength from conclusions reached by academic sources such as The Journal of Marriage and Family.<br /><br />Some critics may bring up the fact that the book focuses on inequalities that exist for fairly privileged Women in America, one of the most progressive countries for women in the world. Critics may ask, 'what about women in other countries, or underprivileged women in America?\\" Yet, this book is a fine place to start thinking and learning about how we can improve the lives and experiences of all women worldwide. As Sandberg mentions, \\"We must raise both the ceiling and the floor.\\" The effort is not only to raise the heights that we can achieve, but to prevent the possible lows to which society can fall.<br /><br />As women we have made great strides, and strides of acceptance for men in non-traditional male roles have been made as well.  But there is more work to be done. Sandberg shows us not only a few core problems, but multiple solutions. The book is not a cry or a whine at all, it is a triumph of solution-centered thinking. Unlike many books on feminist thought, this book does not seek to generate anger in the reader. It seeks to create answers and actions.<br /><br />Though Sandberg speaks to her experience at Facebook,  non-Facebook fans will be glad to hear that the book is not all about life at Facebook. This book focuses upon human relationships, effective communication, and improving the lives of our children.<br /><br />If you want to understand more about the dynamics and challenges facing women and men who work in America today, this book is for you.e lives of our children.<br /><br />If you want to understand more about the dynamics and challenges facing women and men who work in America today, this book is for you.
B005K17RU0|3.0|like the little weather videos best but wished they covered my local area specifically.  otherwise,it works well and is worth the download.
B00821BLX4|5.0|... well yea, you need this for the other two attachments that you are eventually going to buy for your olympus tg-1.<br />this attaches to the camera and then to the tele converter and /or the fisheye lens. im giving it a 5 because it is basically a necessity. . you cant really screw up a necessity, hmm wait a minute yes you can. this is perfect. there is nothing wrong with it and it does exactly what it was meant to do.
B00A50PE6K|3.0|I buy the Christmas Glee album every year and was very excited about this release, my favorite was the Season 2 album--which was the first of the Christmas offerings.  The selection of songs on this album is very traditional but seem to lack the energy and light heartedness of the other two Christmas albums.  All in all, though, if you're a big Glee fan you can hardly pass this album up--it does have some bright spots.  I'd say that the other two albums are well suited for a boisterous party where-as this one would make a good background music to opening Christmas gifts and a quiet family holiday meal.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Quick and cheaper of the Doctor Who DVDs Chris Eccelston made such  great doctor wish he stayed on for more then a season
B004Y042N8|3.0|Its ok, but I think its more for children, I got bored with it real quick so I already deleated it from my tablet.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|what can anyone say it is a DVD you have no right to demand  how many words to write. because<br /><br />of that demand i usually wont write anything why do you need so many statements ITS GOOD SHOULD<br /><br />BE FINE
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I bought PvZ when it came out originally on the PC and then I knew I had to have it for my Droid. I was however disappointed it was not the full game as played on the computer or the updated version found on the iPhone . There is no zen garden and there is a lack of mini-games. I would avoid purchasing this if I would have known it was a stripped down version. The game is still playable and fun but the replay value takes a hit without the inclusion of these features.
1567184855|5.0|what can anyone say it is a BOOK you have no right to demand  how many words to write. because<br /><br />of that demand i usually wont write anything why do you need so many statements ITS GOOD SHOULD<br /><br />BE FINE PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE THE TIME TO ANSWE THESE QUESTIONS
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I agree to ignore the nay-sayers this movie is marvelous! Cannot wait for the next one. Everything I wanted and more!
B009AZZEU2|5.0|That is right, Soundgarden is back!  They know how to rock!  They are a bit more mellow, but still at the top of the heap with a few other bands that are worth talking about (ie. Alice in Chains, Iron Maiden, Megadeth).
B009KEN87O|5.0|I've only had the app for 30 minutes and I've already had more fun with it than most other apps I own.
B001MTENOC|3.0|Personally, this is not my type of book.  I read it for a book club read.  Much of it I believe anyway about what happens at the point of death.  For me, there is just so much you can read about it.  All those testimonials were too many for me.  It did lead to a good discussion for our club.  Many of us talked about what other people we knew said or experienced in similar situations.  If you have a great interest in the subject, it's a quick read.
B00003CXBK|5.0|this was an interesting disney movie i had never heard of i really enjoyed watching it. it was quite entertaining
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Love movies that are based on true stories.  Felt like Brad Pitt was (as usual) believable as the character he portrayed in the film!
B0079J28NW|5.0|this movie i havent seen in so many years in its entirety. it was so awesome to be able to see it again.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Based on true events of Americans who were hiding out at the Canadian Embassy.  Ben Affleck played the CIA agent who orchestrated a fictitious movie called &#34;Argo&#34; to enable these hostages to gain freedom to come back to the U.S.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Even with the ads one of the best I've tried.Didn't like a different  version I paid for. Uninstalled after a couple of games.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Also enjoyed watching the &#34;making of the movie.&#34;  Behind the scenes!  Very interesting~Loved the way the movie had &#34;flash backs&#34; to tell the story.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|Little does the Hugh know, at the end, when he dies, he's actually in a musical hell where, if this were the least bit accurate, his arch nemesis played by Crowe, is ALSO in there with him. Signing.<br /><br />Crowe's singing was horrendous, by the way. A three-note-snooze fest on his part. And voice help.<br /><br />Not a single line of spoken dialogue throughout the entire movie. All signing. Bad choice.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it is very helpful to know exactly how much charge left on my kindle at one glance of the beautiful battery display.  it even lets me know how much time is left for specific applications.
075669812X|5.0|My son is addicted to Lego Ninjago and can't seem to put this book down.  He has read it so much that the binder is now kept together with duct tape.  I'd recommend for any other Ninjago addict out there!
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|As with all Tom Clancy novels, it takes 1/4th of the book before you get the overall picture. I haven't been able to finish it.
1401223176|5.0|Jeph Loeb creates a complete new original story, and a good back story to back it up! This book has about every character you can think of on both the hero and the villain aspect. Batman is being terrorized by every villain from his past only to realize that they are not quite following their individual codes.. which makes Batman uneasy and harder to trust his new love selina, aka catwoman, who is helping him solve this new mystery. What is everyone trying to accomplish? Who is the new mysterious villain? And does Batman or Bruce Waynes past have anything to do with the situation at hand? Read and solve it yourself...I give it 4.5/5 stars!
1592537251|5.0|I had no idea that such an organization for artists existed.  Really good, creative work from all over the world.
0802473156|5.0|This is a great book. Very simple solutions to what we think are complex are complex problems. Everyone in our study group (over 40 people) seem to love it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I love reading the book before I see the movie. I had never heard of this book until I saw all the Grammys the movie won. I thought I would give it a try... I seriously finished in two days. I got so caught up in the characters!
B007ZXK08C|1.0|A horrible story line with detestable characters, everyone in my book club hated it and would not recommend it to anyone
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app got a nice UI update that is very nice and provides a lot of info right up front. The only issue is it is a little slow navigating.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|great show ,will be getting season 2. cant wait to see what is next in the seasons to come. thanks
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book has so many twists & turns. So many surprises!!  I will start the next book with eager anticipation to find out what happens to all the characters I have come to love!!!!!  & all the ones I have come to hate!!!!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|will be getting each season this is a great tv show . different ,like when dark shadows was on this has a good following now to. it will be a classic someday. thanks
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Beach Buggy Blitz is my child's favorite game.  My daughter loved how she bumps into the house and makes it smash in 1,000 pieces.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I am a huge fan of Phillipa Gregory.  I have read every book I can get my hands on. I loved the Kingsmaker's Daughter.  It however did not compare to some of her previous books.  The characters in this book were related to some previous books I have read.  the story was a little hard to get into, but I stuck with it, and enjoyed it.  I don't want to spoil it for the reader, so I will just say that if you are a Phillipa Gregory fan, it is worth reading. I gave it four stars, because it still does not compare with some of her previous books like The Other Boleyn Girl, and Wideacre.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|BUY THIS FILM, listen to Rodriguez's music and question everything!  Compelling, provocotive, miraculous, heartening, human, and beautiful!  Excellent bonus materials that enhance the story even further as if that's possible.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|With books as huge as those in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, the storyline has to be changed slightly to fit into a good length for tv. HBO really does justice to the books, and have done an amazing job casting their characters. Be prepared for some blood and sex scenes throughout all seasons of this series, but you'll also meet a huge cast of interesting characters who each have well-developed storylines.<br /><br />This show is definitely worth owning on DVD or Blu-ray, because it's full of a TON of awesome extras.<br /><br />P.S. If you want to see the funnier side of GoT, I made a Tumblr called Game of Laughs just for that.
B00005YU1O|5.0|this is a film that my students love and speaks to their generation in a medium that's hip, a voice that's strong, and a theme that's needs to be heard.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|LOVE IT!  Kuddos JT for making an innovative cd with a fresh new sound and good lyrics!  I honestly like all the songs on it!
0783225849|5.0|Received excellent service, cd copy and package pristine, and what can further be said about the film except it's a killer!
B004J4WN0I|4.0|I am a little weary of the supernatural sarcastic, jokey hero/heroine. I am happy to be reading from the male POV again as it feels like a female dominated world lately (thankfully...it's just good for some balance). This series would be good for the slightly older Percy Jackson fans or those mid-level teens who are voracious readers...ie there is some sex in it. This books includes immortals, Gods/Goddesses, shape shifting and Druids...something fresh....dominate.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love it. Very addicting, can trap you lol and works your brain. Definitely a great app to get! :)
B009YP9L7U|5.0|One of my first ebooks and the best so far!  I love a book that makes me laugh out loud with the characters!  Mira has a way of making her characters feel so real.  Definitely a must read on anyone's book list!
B005IZLPME|5.0|We love this movie!  It is very interesting and has great action sequences.  Captain America is a &#34;real&#34; hero. :-)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was astonishing and I couldn't ever put it down. Each chapter left you wanting more. Fabulous novel that will leave you breathless!
B0083EXW50|4.0|Fantastic if your looking for some heavily use of double bass drum. I also enjoy the hints of industrial programming in each song. &#34;Virus of Faith&#34; & &#34;The Industrialist&#34; are the winning tracks here.

B000SFD21Q|5.0|This book is simply amazing. I learned so much reading through this. Its written in such a way that the average person can understand and is backed by countless studies. Really makes you want to get moving!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I was really looking forward to trying this match 3 game since I really enjoyed Call of Atlantis, another games from the same company. It hasn't letme down.<br />It has great graphics, professional look &amp; feel,  play is smooth and is very enjoyable to play. Plays &amp;  looks great on 8.9&quot;  Kindle Fire.  No issues at all. Highly recommend.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Wonderful reading! Deep intrigues and suspense. The Devil Colony is a great read! I really did like the historical parts.
0765365278|5.0|After slugging through the first half of The Hero of Ages, I had already regretted buying the author's next work in advance.<br />Thankfully, The Way of Kings is much superior to the Mistborn series as a whole. Not really storywise, as Mistborn: The Final Empire can hold its own, but at least regarding the narrative there is no comparison.<br />The characters are presented with much more maturity, and even though you are presented to several different POVs in sequence, they don't feel redundant.<br />It's also nice to see how little those characters have in common with the previous works by the author, and how they can stand on their own.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a fun game that will keep you occupied for a lot of wasted hours.  Kind of addicting but a good game anyway.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|Warning, spoilers ahead. Well, can they really be called spoilers? You've already seen everything in this movie. It was called Lord of the Rings. The biggest flaw with this film is that it is 3 hours long, and split into 3 separate films. 9 hours. There simply isn't enough material to work with here. I can sum up this film very simply: Dwarves run towards Lonely Mountain being chased by orcs. That's all that happens in this movie.<br /><br />Fortunately, you can skip it, because you've already seen everything in LOTR. I'm sure someone creative could easily cut and paste clips from the 3 major films and recreate the first Hobbit. Frodo and Bilbo sit around talking about adventures and parties. Gandalf comes in and convinces him to go on an adventure. Someone is attacked at the old hill castle by a ghost king. Gandalf leads them through caves chased by orcs. The orcs hunt them in open fields on giant dogs. The orcs are led by, you guessed it, a taller slimmer orc. The trolls even have a short cameo. Gollum splashes around in a cave carrying on about his ring. The giant eagles rescue the Fellowship and fly them towards the mountain (why don't they just fly them the whole way??). They walk along a thin path on the side of the mountain and what happens? Yep, the mountain begins to fall. It just keeps going.<br /><br />Literally everything in this movie, I had seen before. All the original, new stuff that I may have been interested in actually seeing is apparently saved for a later movie. Plus, the CGI is far too obvious.<br /><br />So in conclusion, skip this film. It's tediously boring.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This is a fun game but you run out of free coins too soon.  My grandkids enjoyed it for awhile but then we were out of coins.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Hey there-- My son loves this app, enjoy, keeps you busy & they are entertained for hours.... Many levels and
B009DJB8I2|5.0|I Bought this just to get the TF2 item code within it and it worked, so if you are buying this for that then you will be in luck.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved the books.  Loved the characters.  Love Colleen Hoover.  As another reviewer mentioned, this book is better than the Slammed series...which are good themselves.  I loved the twist, and did not guess it as I do with many books.  I love the romance and the history that they had.  Kudos
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The story is unique and compelling and it is very well told. I'd recommend it to any fan of WWII aviation history.  The highest praise I can give a book is that I didn't want it to end, and that's how I feel about 'A Higher Call'.
B001MIV0J4|5.0|Right up front I have to tell you I am a British humor fan....Monty Python, Fawlty Towers, Little Britain, League of Gentleman and Absolutely Fabulous DVD's, just to name a few, are constantly playing in my workroom most evenings, so I am always on the look out for more of the same.  While &#34;RocknRolla&#34; is not cut from the same tartan clothe as the previously mentioned works, much of the humor in this movie has its roots in that same sometimes dry and and always thought provoking British wit.<br /><br />This movie is littered with a wild cast of characters who all have their own little story going on within the confinds of the movie.....and the wonderful thing about this movie is seeing how Guy Richie weaves and intertwines the individual stories into a complete story that has all of the parts coming together in the end.  This movie has so many levels to the story that the rich texture makes you want to watch over and over because no matter how many times you see it, you always find bits and pieces you missed before.<br /><br />It, I must tell you, helps if you are familiar with British slang and style to get all of the &#34;inside&#34; jokes, but the real pleasure of this movie are the characters. From the no nonsense connected crime boss Lenny, the suave enforcer Archie, the Wild Bunch......Handsome Bob, Mumbles and One Two, to the beautifully smooth and devious accountant, Stella. and the wiser than his years, drugged up real RocknRolla, Johnny Quid, the story takes you on a ruckus and sometimes disturbing ride through London's underbelly.<br /><br />This movie is not for everyone..........if you don't enjoy the British style humor and you don't want to view this a few times to see all that is going on stay away, but in my opinion, the music, witty dialog and great cast of characters make this a fun ride through the dark side of England, and more directly, London's mob scene.  Just keep an open mind.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great characters! Disappointed with the ending though. Will be checking out the rest of Flynns books hope to be pleased
B009KEN87O|5.0|Amazing and addicting game just a great game overall, fun, simple, andmy niece loves it and she only two years old
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Amazing, couldn't put it down. The story flowed flawlessly and I'm excited to read his telling of the story! Must Read
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I was very weary about a game like this as it does not catch my interest. Although when playing I got sucked right into it and had to finish the game. Now I am a fan lol. It's fun adventurous and makes you think...only if you don't cheat with the hint or skip button, which is really tempting sometimes but makes it fun if your a thinker like myself.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It's addictive and fun! Another great Angry Birds game. I have it on my Kindle Fire and cell phone. I can play at home or away. Perfect.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|The movie was shipped very well and I was excited to recieve it. I watched it immediatly. I have no complaints.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I only recently heard Lana Del Rey and her deep, harmonic voice is beautiful.  Very happy with the CD.  Some of the lyrics are a bit on the dark side, but the sound is beautiful.  The CD arrived on time and in new condition
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I really like the energy in this recording, although some of the lyrics are a bit over the top for me.  The CD arrived very quickly (before i was expecting it).  Very happy with the purchase.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|the storyline is just too good to be true.  The sexy bits are very hot but at my time of life I want something more out of a novel.  The characters are quite unbelievable.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Love it. Simply great and addicting. Very much like the old games and worth it.I've been playing all day and I like the graphics
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I started off looking for a replacement RSS feeder for my desktop PC with the projected demise of GOOGLE Reader. I was so delighted with the Firefox feedly add on that the following day I looked to see if there was a Feedly android app. HAVE TO SAY,it could not have been simpler. Downloaded and installed the app was asked for permission to get details from my Google reader account and lo and behold my rss feeds are now all here on my kindle fire. The display is neat and tidy and completely intuitive to use. Well worth a five star rating.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|loved it. this is why games on my phone look so awesome, great game and looks way cool to give it a try
B009D0LBRO|5.0|wow what a fun game, it looks beautiful and plays really well, the one touch controls are intuitive i was worried at first but it turned out to be awesome
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I am just in awe of Adele's CD. I love every song; the arrangements are amazing. I love her voice-it is so pure and raw all at the same time.  I get goose bumps when she hits those pure notes.  The songs range from shades of Motown, Janis Joplin, Sade, and so many more. What a great compliation of songs. This is why people used to buy CDs.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Love the writing of this sitcom. It is soooo funny.  I love the characters and their interactions with one another.  I laugh out loud every episode!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|What I requested and on time. I'm happy. Saw it in a theater when it first came out and thought then &#34;This is one for our library&#34;
B0043WDK2G|5.0|All of the seasons are &#34;Just plain great.&#34; Great characters, good stories, and lots of humor!<br />Watch and you will not be disappointed.
0345803485|2.0|Wanted to see what all the buzz was about.  Cannot imagine how they can get 3 books out of this.  I know....I'm in a minority.....just saying.....
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a great app for horse people or even<br />  not. I'm not a horse person but I really am enjoying this. its very realistic which makes it super fun.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Great show and so easy to download to my Tivo from Amazon so I could watch it at home! Thank you!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am heart broken over the end. No hope for a happy ending. Why would I read the rest. Too bad, the sex was amazing, but the beating at the end was unforgivable.
1451648537|4.0|Walter Isaacson pulls no punches and is a very concise writer particularly since he was forced to rush to book to market.
B004GYY714|5.0|I used to use WinAmp to stream radio on my Android tablet.  But WinAmp's selection of stations is very limited compared to TuneIn Radio.  Virtually every radio station that streams is available on this app, and many have multiple streams, so you can choose a smaller stream if you have less bandwidth.  The sleep timer and Car Mode are also important features.<br /><br />Just as important, the free version is not crippled-you can listen to anything you want for as long as you want.  The pay version does add desirable features such as pausing and recording.
B006LR0XLM|4.0|This is a very efficient service with ample storage for free!! I can back-up important files for work & school so I don't have to worry about limited flashdrive storage, or worse... losing my device along with all my music, photos & work that can't be replaced. Also, it's a great way to choose which files I can upload & share with specific groups of people. Dropbox syncs to all my devices, I use it on the laptop, android & tablet so I always have easy access to my files from anywhere. I would recommend Dropbox for anyone looking for a simple to use storage solution.
0385349947|2.0|Will it or won't it? Could it or couldn't it? Should it or shouldn't it? These are all extremely valuable questions to ask as we enter these exciting, tumultuous times ahead of us. Will the stimulus package help, or will the subsequent inflationary times be the final nail in the oak laden coffin of death, decay and destruction? My advice... I'll keep my money in gold, and suffer with the rest of you during these anxiety wrenching times that will surely make the great depression seem like a trip to Midas Muffler. (Without the backfire!) Hey, at least we can have our cake...but can we eat it too? That my friends is the $64,000 question. Stayed tuned... Agree with me or not, I am surely entitled to my opinion! Ride safe my compadres. And never forget, keep the rubber side down and as always, I'll see you at Sturgis!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was a slow start but once it got going, it was WONDERFUL.  I plan to read it  again. Be patient when beginning the book.  It surely gets better.
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|The story is good but it is disappointing that the story is \\"to be continued\\" again. Have to wait for the next episode to be released.
B00270CS6K|5.0|Part of what stylized Pulp Fiction was its music. To hear this album without the movie -- whether the short clips of dialogue or the longer tracks of the music -- makes this soundtrack soar. Enjoy the &#34;sans sight&#34; experience!<br /><br />Sherry
B0063IH60K|5.0|Many yrs since I've played solitaire, so I was a bit rusty.  The rules link was very helpful in that respect.  I particularly love the various little dances the cards do at the end of the game when I choose &quot;auto.&quot;
B009RH9J7W|5.0|This is a sturdy, good looking case with several benefits.  I especially like the ability to rotate my Kindle and prop it up at several angles.  The interior hand strap is a great place to tuck a screen cleaning cloth, too.  There are other cases costing more.  Don't bother.  This one is a winner.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is required reading.<br /><br />Of course, it also helps if you lived those years as a fledgling geek-in-training as well.<br /><br />Great read. Thanks to the author for letting me relive some of those years, for better or worse. Nostalgia is a hell of a drug
B007HACDLK|5.0|This has been a great series that continues to shine.<br />Plot was very interesting and tied around current history.<br />Characters are strong and richly developed.
B005SQ3AI0|5.0|I only discovered Dinah Washington recently, and what a find. There are so many singers that it's hard to be familiar with even a small portion of the good ones. Lots of music in one box. Great Price; Great Delivery--three days.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|A New and exciting twist with history turning into a Sci-Fi film.<br />It kept you on your toes and was enjoyable to watch.  It is a film I<br />would buy and add to my movie collection real happily.
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|Love the music. The Lyrics? Well, I've never been good at following the words, and the lines fade in and out as I listen to the music. Great product; excellent delivery time.
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|Talk about taking a turn in the adventure and leading you into the totally un-exspected events that will unfold and nothing like you would think seeing the end of the Season one.  I'm truly enjoying watching this series to see what happens next.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  Easy read. Loved the plot twists  I was routing for the main characters the whole time. Can't wait to start the sequel. :)
B009NQKPUW|5.0|A exciting and intoxicating film.  Keeping you on your toes and alway's on<br />the edge of your seat.  Well worth the watch and would love to buy the movie and add<br />it to my movie collection to watch again and again.  I would also love to see another film to<br />follow with how it ended leaving you wondering what was going to happen as they leave<br />it open for another to follow in my book.  Was well worth the watch.
1475972350|5.0|Love this book! I knew that after reading the first chapter that it was going to be a long night. But it was well worth it. Todd did a great job with brining the charters to life. I can not wait until the next one.
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|Good continuance of the story line and full of action.<br />Would like to buy this one as it kept you wondering how it<br />was going to go down with the standing of the previous films.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I just installed this game last night, just test drove it this morning, so far  I think my boyz will enjoy it. Or mom may become the addicted one. LOL
B004HAEGP4|5.0|Was a good movie with action just not as good as the earliers but well worth the deal if you<br />like this series.  Due to me liking these film's and having 3 of the collection already.  I would consider buying<br />it so that I could keep up with the series and have the full collection as it follows through<br />the story line.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great game. Good blast-em-up. Got it while free. Not sure it's worth 2.50. It gets fast quickly. Nice to be able to scoot all over the screen. Have yet to see higher levels.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|Was a good movie with good twist and A great watch for Horror and Sci-Fi match in sense.<br />Enjoyed the movie and had fun watching it.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Funny, painful, and very, very real. Also extremely romantic. The fact that it's remarkably well-written and full of appealing characters is an extra bonus.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|I love this series and how it is ever changing but also very attentive to action and the un-expected things that occur with the adventure of it all.  It is great to watch and well worth in variety and never could be bored as it doesn't alway's focus on just one thing.  Nothing like a lame soap that is for sure.  It is full of Action, Fantasy, Adventure, and fun.  I would recommend anyone who love's a variety in any Sci-Fi adventure that gives you taste's of New, Exciting, Adventuring, and even a little comedy and romance all rolled into one with all unknown and nothing alway's as it you would think it would appear happening.  To watch this excellent series. :)
B00785P2QC|5.0|the game makes you feel like a mayor . the game has problems like cars breaking down an stuff like that
B0000501C3|5.0|I have been an enthusiastic listener of baroque music for a very long time. Musica Antiqua of Koln, Germany made a great job interpreting the elegant music of Jean-Baptiste Lully to fit into the atmosphere of Versailles. I highly recommend it for those who are interested in the music of Jean-Baptiste Lully. His music is about as efervescent as a fine Champagne.
B0090SI44M|4.0|Recently purchased this video because we are planning to see &#34;Monsters University&#34; next. I also went to the Disney rewards and I got points for this purchase and one $10 dollar movie ticket to see &#34;Monsters University&#34; good buy!
B00AJLYYKM|5.0|This is the best written comedy of all time. No matter how tough a day you have had, this show will make you laugh.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Grissom' s story is engaging and told with just enough roughness to remain true to history.  She captures the essence and heart of what a true family is, regardless of race. I especially love how her two narrators meld together.
0061990477|5.0|Probably best book I have ever read, keeps you interested and you don't want to put it down or do you want it to end.
B0014JKJJI|5.0|I use these at my job. I work in a restaurant, and their perfect; because, there'd slip resistant. I don't have to worry about tripping or falling. I also use these when I go to class since the shoes have to be slip resistant in the medical field as well. I could be on my feet all day and unlike my coworkers I'm not  complaining that my feet hurt by the end of the night. All I wear is crocs now it seems to be the only shoe that doesn't make me sore when I wear them. I've even started wearing these particular brand of shoes to the gym and they work wonderful. I highly recommend them to anyone! =)
B005K0HDGE|4.0|The book got a little dry for me, I'm not a huge history buff. But the storyline and concept had me dying to know what was going to happen next.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Cool game it is as good as the first one if not better in some ways<br />But I do really miss being the zombies

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I've been waiting for this CD to come out and I am so very pleased with it.  I LOVE IT!!! highly recommend it...
0761129235|4.0|This book has clever methods of rearranging one's thinking, providing an opportunity to redirect one's life on a more desirable path, even if change feels overwhelming.
B009B4ZEMA|5.0|Love Christina's music and her CD is wonderful!!!  I would definitely recommend her fans go out and purchase it if they haven't done so already.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game takes time and patience but is totally worth it. I would recommend it to people who liked the original Farmville and/or dragons.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I generally don't bother with computer chess. This is easy to use, to step away from, return later to pick up where I left off.
1451695187|3.0|This summary is a little too brief for what it cost.  Took me about 10 minutes to read it.  Buy the whole book.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I had to get this in my collection! I found out my adult son had never seen it, so I got it to watch with him. He laughed out loud several times! Great movie if you want to have fun or just need to laugh.
B000001IQH|5.0|This is one of the best punk rock albums ever, one of the best albums from the 1990s and is an excellent listen from the first track to the last.  Pure rock and roll at its finest.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Excellent movie guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat! They young guy (Chris Pine) was the young James T. Kirk in the new Star Trek movie. He did a great job. Great actor! I HAD to get this one in my collection. Beware of eating popcorn during this movie...you'll stuff yourself from the suspense!
072325804X|5.0|Great quality service and product! Loved these stories as a child myself! Can't wait to share them with my son.
B006BQM762|3.0|Great movie and thought it was worth the time to watch it.  Would recommend to others as well as friends.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|An incredible story about indomitable men. A highly personal account of their tragic deaths in battle in Afghanistan and the touching support of Americans at home.
B0073PZN8O|4.0|Great movie and thought it was worth the time to watch it.  Would recommend to others as well as friends.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome! I absolutly LOVED it! It took me awhile to get down to reading it, so the craze is gone now, but it was worth it! And, surprise, suprise, it wasn't what I expected it to be. Everyone was harping on the whole &#34;picked off one by one&#34; but that was the last thing on my mind. Which is good, cause I'm not a fan of those kind of things.<br />But yeah, awesome book. Had me on the edge of my seat all the time!
B00574Q7PQ|4.0|Cool movie and worth the time and cost.  Would recommend it to others and any friends.  Liam is always a good actor.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The best but the saddest and tons of action I really liked this book but I think the hunger games was the best.
0307352153|5.0|as an introvert I learned why in life I had so often been left or felt I had been left.  This book helped me accept and honor my natural state while appreciating those other in a new way.<br /><br />I recommend this book to all who still are confounded at times, feel diminished in the hubbub of life in the world of speed and noise.
0679805273|5.0|Received very fast and in excellent condition. Bought this for my child's teacher to write in every year at the end of the school year.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game has kept me entertained for a few hours so far. Look forward to lots more. Probably not so for good  players, but I am just a beginner.
B00008977N|5.0|This DVD contains wonderful music; Peter, Paula Cole, and the individual musicians of his ensemble created a very compelling tapestry.  The visuals are also very engaging; I was particularly pleased with the various frolicking around on the stage, just as I do when I listen to the CD (which I've had for years).  I'm a fan of Peter Gabriel's, and I think his songwriting is his strongest talent, but it's greatly enhanced by his presentation and musicianship.  All in all, I think this is one of the best -- if not THE best -- musical DVDs  I have ever seen; a lot of care and professionalism went into the production, the songs are varied, and the music fidelity is excellent (at least to my 72 year old ears).  I highly recommend it.

B007MJSSCY|4.0|BBC does a terrific job on this type of movie with great acting and an interesting story line. Not the type of Blockbuster that we expect in the States but very entertaining.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|Zero Dark Thirty(released Dec/12)stars,among others,Jessica Chastain as Maya,Jason Clarke as Dan,Joel Edgerton as Patrick,Chris Pratt as Justin,Mark Strong as George,Jennifer Ehle as Jessica,and<br />Kyle Chandler as Joseph Bradley.The potential for a super movie was all there:great cast,locations and the ultimate point of capturing a top terrorist.Unfortunately the plot/editing and too much attention to detail,derails this film before it has an even chance of getting off the ground.<br />The Reader's Digest version of this film intro's us to a CIA agent(Chastain)who has been working on getting Osama Bin Laden for 12 years,and nothing else.She shows up at a detainee center,first as an observer then as an active participant.Time passes in years as bombings start occurring around the world,post 9/11.They can only glean so much information out of their \\"methods of persuasion\\",and when Bush is replaced by Obama,the detainee program quickly comes to a halt.The bombings continue,even one that kills a close friend of Chastain's in a compound in Afghanistan.Chastain makes very slow head way through it all with her superiors,but keeps pushing with a lead that to her is the best in many years.When the intel piles up to such a great degree,then and only then,is she finally able to get a go ahead for a mission.Two stealth copters will invade a compound in Islamabad where she believes Bin Laden and some underlings are hiding out.The operation goes through and is a success.Bin Laden is killed and his body brought back for an ID by Chastain.The movie ends as Chastain hops aboard a transport she has all to herself and sits down,totally exhausted.<br />The long story?.....well you will have to watch the movie yourself.And at 150 or so minutes this thing is a LONG trek.....TOO long.I found myself watch watching more than a few times.The film takes us inexorably through the interrogating of prisoners(water boarding and the like),Chastains inability to make any headway with her bosses above her,the bombings around the world year after year,the change in the political landscape which directly affects their ability to gain intel,and on and on.The movie does pick up slightly when they finally invade the compound of Bin Laden,but even that is very slow moving with no real excitement built in.The thing is with a film like this:we know beforehand the outcome and all the incidents leading up to the finale.The trick for the director and script writers on a movie of this type is how interesting are you going to make it in order to grab my attention away from what I already know? It's like say the TV series The Band of Brothers.The record of that outfit was well known and written about,but the creators made it so interesting and compelling it was bound to be an instant hit.This film,I'm sorry to say,does not even come close to approaching that find of film making.The makers of Zero Dark Thirty failed to do what they had to do to get the job done.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include four featurettes.<br />All in all a big disappointment.The film's creators failed to create any kind of excitement or compelling reason to be apathetic to material we all knew the background on in advance.Watching paint dry?......you bet.2 1/2- 3 stars.above her,the bombings around the world year after year,the change in the political landscape which directly affects their ability to gain intel,and on and on.The movie does pick up slightly when they finally invade the compound of Bin Laden,but even that is very slow moving with no real excitement built in.The thing is with a film like this:we know beforehand the outcome and all the incidents leading up to the finale.The trick for the director and script writers on a movie of this type is how interesting are you going to make it in order to grab my attention away from what I already know?

B00BHMETKC|5.0|You know going in that the story is true but you wonder how much embellishment was made. Affleck does a great job and it deserved all of the awards that it won.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun. My little girl loves horses. It teaches some basics about the care! We both love the graphics as well.
B003R17BV0|5.0|Great movie and an incredible true story of a young man who beat the Brits for a US Open when they were the best players in golf.

B009UNGYHG|4.0|Only one let down, plantronics should supply the USB blue tooth adapter. Otherwise works well, ideal way to keep the bulky earpiece protected and charged.  The earpiece is bulky to look at but very comfortable to wear and unobtrusive, if you have hair covering the main over the ear portion.
B00028HBKC|5.0|i cried the whole entire moving, it surely gives u a idea of what our lord and savior really sacrifice just for us
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|This guy is a real bad a$$$$. It's hard to really like this guy.  How could he be so heartless?
B0055OK2T0|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie --- of course I love most movies that have to do with time and alternate concepts of our lives --- it was a love conquers all type movie which is some times just fun
B00B10HAO2|5.0|This movie wasn't what I expected it to be. These actors are amazing and watching about hitchcock and his wife was a wonderful insight.
B000V63BN6|5.0|Love all the old Motown --- and Stevie Wonder -- the great from the 70's --- great to hear him belt out those classic hits I grew up on
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Even though you know how it's going to end, each time I watch it I'm holding my breath and digging my nails into my palms with anticipation.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love this show --- and I think they are keeping it going --- I love Julianna Margulies have since the ER days am so excited to see her on this show and what a super part for her ;)
B006G2124E|5.0|All these actresses are amazing and fabulous. I watch this movie once a month and constantly finding new things in it.
B0039UTDA6|5.0|Incredible images, fantastic information, and I adored Oprah's narration.  I thought it all worked together to create a truly awesome experience.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This did not go the way I expected and that's a good thing!  So many plot twists! After the first section I was loathe to put it down! VERY well-written!
B009KEN87O|5.0|this is definately a blast from the past. I. down loaded to my kindle fire works great.. great game to past time
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Very good plot concept. Great characters as often occurs in a Baldacci novel. He has the gift of taking individuals of questionable character or living outside conventional norms and developing them into hero's for whom you have a strong rooting interest.
B004XVMCMQ|1.0|Nothing like the movie. Why do they use the same title as Jane Austen's book when they basically made up their own story.  I hate everything about this movie.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great controls, graphics, and game play!  Best time waster I've played this month!  Love that you are right back in play after dying, and continue option is really nice too!
1419707663|5.0|It's all about life in a kids<br />Eye and it speaks to me and that's why this is a great book
B009UZBLSG|5.0|Reason I purchase this item is that I use PS3 to my projector to watch movies it worked OK but I wanted to stream movies directly from internet and that is where ps3 caped out browser is slow and doesn't support anything.<br /> I have Nexus 4 and this cable mirrors everything on to my projector with no problems I am extremely impressed with performance and quality. FYI it doesn't work on Nexus 7.<br />I'm very particular about quality and performance of things I buy so by with confidence.<br />A+
B008CX2A2I|3.0|good but limited.it works ok but it would be better if it could be connected to any bluetooth anable equipment
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this series. Wonderful costumes. Love the castle. Every thing about this series is great. A must for any one who enjoys this time period.
B00021HBGS|5.0|My little guys love playing with these in the tub.  They are sturdy and bright.  They are made out of foam so if your child bites them, it will leave teeth marks.  I like that they come with a mesh storage bag that hangs so that the toys will drip dry.
B00AB2NYNC|4.0|Good music, but as usual one song is the best in CD.  I did enjoy the upbeat music of this CD.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|They did a fantastic job! I was a bit doubtful but meets or exceeds the Lord of the Rings movie quality and charm. Very good movie can't wait for part 2.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love these books! I'm on the final one now and I love the way she writes. Every sentence is so simplistic, yet makes you feel like your there. ;)
B008KOTNVA|5.0|This screwdriver fits into all the screws for my electronics, so it is really useful! I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to open their macbooks.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved her other books, but this one kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time! Flynn is the queen of the unexpected twist!!! Definitely recommend this book!!!
B004P8JPS6|3.0|I have read several Lee Child books and have always enjoyed them.  Love the Jack  Reacher character - he's always up to something interesting and challenging.<br /><br />This book seemed to have an inordinate amount of detail and tended to lose my attention at times.  I would still recommend it.<br /><br />.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I got this as a gift for my daughter, as she is a Hendrix fan. I have not heard if she likes the songs or not, but to add to her collection was great.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is not your average fantasy book. It forces you to realize that, at the end of that day, you are the only one who can choose whether or nit to be a piece in anybody's games. Whether it be the government's or of people you call your friends.
B0076LAF24|5.0|I'd never been privy to a chemicals show, so i must say they dominated from start to end...beautiful sounds visual delight
B005G5PPGS|5.0|This is a great book, tells the story of how you can succeed in a tremendously overpaid sport, clap clap!
B000FA675C|4.0|This is a great suspense novel. Just sit back and enjoy it, and forget all of the controversy that surrounds this book. It has plenty of drama, narrow escapes, and a little romance. The Kindle format is very good; I didn't find any weird page breaks or other annoyances. The table of contents actually works, so you can skip to a previous chapter if you've missed something and then go right back to where you left off. It's an easy read and the story flows very well.<br /><br />Just remember, this book is fiction! If Mr. Brown's story intrigues you, there's plenty of places to learn more about the theories stated in the DaVinci Code. University databases are a good place to start for reputable sources.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a good game I got soo addicted to it that now my high score is 3 million it is very addicting and I am not kidding all of y'all should get it very fun so you need to tat it this instant
B002RVZV9K|5.0|This is a must have for anyone who enjoys Rock & Roll, guitar, music, music history, guitar history, etc. Jimmy Page, The Edge & Jack White come together and have an incredible conversation about all of it. And then they play together. I've recommended this to everybody I know.
B0080SW3CC|5.0|5 Stars for awesome quality, came looking new and untarnished with a complimentary bookmark and a thank you letter. Awesome service and quick delivery. Thanks very much !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app has amazing graphics,high quality,and many other awesome things. Gotta love this game, it deserves five stars, GO HORSES!!!
B009R5GR1K|5.0|It provides similar words and various languages translation. It is a must have for your kindle. I upgraded to the pro version for offline access
B008YKGQR4|1.0|After having a few problems with the Facebook app, I downloaded this because it had mostly favorable reviews. For me, the  first time i tried to log in, it froze and had to close. I tried three more times and I didn't even make it to the log in screen. So for me this app never even loaded Facebook.
B001C46P2K|5.0|This film has everything; great story, great acting & fabulous set decorating. Emily Blunt is turning into a first rate actress. The casting as a whole is masterful. I enjoyed every minute of it and would recommend it to those of all ages.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|This movie is full of action and has a good story.  Visually stunning and enjoyable for all age groups!  Perfect!
B002RI9ZUE|5.0|Hypnotic and disturbing.<br /><br />I completely understand why this book has captivated so many readers, yet I'm struggling to put into words my thoughts on it. Though I'm struggling to make sense of my thoughts this book really spoke to me. Which in some ways is terrifying.
B002APU580|5.0|Wonderful adaptation of a great book, a true classic!  Everything about this movie is shear perfection!  I could watch it over and over again!
B007QUUJMG|5.0|I related to so much of this book, having been an outsider and self-diagnosed 'wallflower'. I like that tormented teens could pick it up, relate to some of the themes, and leave it with a sense that things will be good soon enough.<br /><br />This book made my heart smile.
B004LQEYAG|3.0|I've watched this many times and was disappinted to find certain scenes cut out of the movie.  I would not recommend buying this movie.  I was very disappointed.
B000009VOL|5.0|I discovered this album years ago by rifling through a freinds collection and fell in love with them.  I have bought all the other albums, and just-rebought this one as I lost my first one.  I love the tempo and the unique style on this album.  I highly recommend this one.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|A long time fan of all the Columbo movies, I was happy to see this offered as a complete series.  The quality is excellent and I highly recommend this collection to any Columbo fan.
B009D0KER2|4.0|Great way to read the paper. Nice clear photos. Installs quickly. Easy to cleanly uninstall if you decide it's not for you.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I had this on VHS but was happy to see it on DVD.  It was excellently remastered.  No scenes were cut and I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end.  There are former versions of this movie which I have scene but found this one to be the best.  I highly recommend this movie for all romantic fans.
B00511PTWM|5.0|This is a great product.  I ordered one for my car for a road trip and found it to be very useful.  Since I move my radar detector, camera and GPS from one car to another I decided it was easier to have adapters in each car.  I now own four, two for each of my road trip cars.
B000BZISTE|3.0|This DVD seems to have some scenes edited out.  While I am a fan of the later series, this was a bit disappinting.  I have since ordered some season episodes the the later Mash version.
B000002MFE|5.0|My earliest introduction to Eric Clapton was in the late sixties when after hearing first Sunshine of Your Love and then the whole Disraeli Gears album I soon followed up with hearing Wheels of Fire upon its release with White Room and Crossroads forever cementing Eric Slow Hand Clapton as an all time favorite rock guitarist for not only me but seemingly legions of fans who would proclaim either vocally of with banners held high, \\"Clapton is God!\\" It was then then I gegan my unabated Eric Clapton album buying spree.  It was with this back ground that I went to hear Cream live at the NYC Madison Square Garden located above the NY Penn Station with my younger brother at age 19.  By then I had discovered Clapton's background with The Yardbirds and John Mayall's Blues Breakers, a group that over its relatively speaking brief history had also featured Jeff Beck and Jimmy Paige as lead guitarists at varying intervals of time.  Following the MSG concert, Clapton made his rock star presence known with such classic albums as Blind Faith, Derek and the Dominoes, George Harrison's All Things Must Pass, Delaney & Bonnie on Tour and more to follow.  (Please excuse me if my seqience is off - it was a long time ago and I am not getting any younger).  So, by the time the Unplugged album was released (early'90's by my recollection) he was already an established rock icon.  Unplugged was unmistakingly a new musical venue for Claton who as a rock guitarist his virtuosity was by then long lived and firmly established.  In Unplugged he demonstrates his mastery of the blues idiom once again without the aid of an electric sound system, speakers, and studio expertise and state of the art technology to play as masterfully a live performance that surely exceeded the record producers and audience's highest expectations.  In this now classic CD Eric Clapton while demonstraing, as I have already said, his mastery of the classic blues style and idiom also recreaed his classic renditions of Willie Dixon's Crossroads and his own composition, Layla during this now historic peformance.  This is a CD that has to be heard and then replayed over and over again.  Each time I listen to this classic masterpiece of Rock history it always sounds fresh and new.  So, if you haven't heard part or all of it yet or if you arelatively new to the music library of Eric Clapton this CD album is a must buy.  Enjoy!
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|This isn't just the ABB but a 7 CD - 129 song compilation of some amazing blues and southern rock.  I got in on the pre-order by an alert from the Tedeschi Trucks Band...get it - ain't cheap - but you won't regret it.
B00A17AD36|4.0|every 20 to 50 years artist come and go and are replaced by others some with ok voices,some with \\"ehhh so,so\\"then there is god sent beings with true gifts of beautiful natrual notes without \\"auto-tune help\\" and that person is the weekend not too fond of the name though,but his voice makes up for everything else to be critizised by nay-sayers,the weekend is the future of modern music he sings like a michael jackson prodigy but i wont compare michael to him he's in a class all by himself as he should be weekend you have made a lifelong fan out of me.
B007WFR1TE|5.0|If you need in your face Riffing fast and furious with the 7 string heavyness than look no further this album has it. Fear Factory does it as always.
B001TKK3O8|3.0|If you like decent murder movies, this one is pretty decent. The price is also reasonable as it is well over $20 at any movie store.
B008MZPVP4|5.0|Its a perfect album, If you like Down then you know what I am Saying. Buy it, buy it, buy it.
1401937519|5.0|This is a great book and helpful for those whom have lost loved ones. Wonderfully written and the best book yet far on subject.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|This story has been written dozens of times by dozens of different authors.  After you've read it, in one form or another time after time, it becomes rather boring.  Sorry, but I found nothing new in this book.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Great movie and may be a classic some day. I loved watching it. even my wife liked it. I recommend it to everyone.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|This is a great collection of four great action movies that are very fun to watch over and over again.  The quality is outstanding.

B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This is a great movie about our history of a real bad time in the history of the United States.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am very pleased with the quality and design of this case.  It holds a Nikon D7000 which is a large heavy camera very well.  I has flexibility and will hold all the stuff I need to go on a shoot and protect my camera and accessories.  For the price, you can't beat it!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I thought the movie captured your interest right from the start with a lot of action.  It had some humor but also an important message about parental responsibility, especially fathers.
B004A2U4V4|5.0|An oldie but favorite of mine.  I love every song.  I have their new album and they just keep getting better with age.
