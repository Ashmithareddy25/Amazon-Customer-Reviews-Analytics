B00887490Y|2.0|Well, sadly, I have not been as excited to watch a movie and so let down come the end in a long, long time! In truth, it starts off great, has a really nice who-is-the-bad guy question attached to its murky, cold cinemtaic breath. But two thirds of the way through (and after a seemingly brilliant twist!), it suddenly veers into unknown, questionable territory.    Allow me to explain without giving the (end) game away - which, in truth would be wildly imaginative of me to be able to as I have no idea what the f**k happened come the end anyway!    Children are missing from a small town called Cold Rock. Once a thriving mining town, when it shut down they started vanishing, one by one. As the film opens it tells us that 800,000 children are reported missing per year in the USA, that most a found, but a 1,000 are never seen again.    After a scene where Julia (Biel) is badly beaten and getting medical attention, we flashback to 36 hours prior. What unfolds then for the next 50 minutes is your better-than-average whodunnit, but when her son is kidnapped by the \\"Tall Man,\\" suddenly the whole town is sent out on a murderous man hunt - but not for him, for her!    You see, and again, not to (try) and give it away, this is where we have to try and figure out the plot for ourselves! I'm not kidding here either for it's as if the director quit one hour in (don't blame him!) and said film whatever you want, add it to the end of the movie, and put it in the stores! I can guess as to what it was all meant to mean, but some pieces just don't fit. Like, well, if Julia knew the \\"Tall Man' and what he was up to, why did she chase after his truck, allow herself to get bitten by his dog, and throw herself about in the woods?!    Russell A.

B001K3KK0Q|5.0|Great classic movie that is just like the book. Very few movies have not been changed so much from the book you can hardly recognize them but not true about this movie.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|I realize that some people are still reading this trilogy and some others plan to read it. But in a review, I believe I should post my honest opinion. The first words that come to mind regarding this trilogy are: verbose, repetitive, lack of rich descriptive words, new Olympic sport!  The author uses too many words to describe scenes, therefore, verbose. The author seems to lack creativity, therefore she repeats scenes almost word for word. How many times does someone \\"put a piece of hair\\" behind her ear. Who cares? It's redundant after the first time. The author should take a look at the rich, descriptive adjectives and adverbs used in \\"The Shack\\". I could feel, smell and taste the rain as it was described at the start of the book. For goodness sake, make a list of rich, meaty descriptive words and use them! Grey eyes, blue eyes, blue shirt. Again, who cares? Be creative and describe it another way. Most of the sex scenes could have been eliminated or glanced over. At that point, it could have been published as one book with three parts. I don't believe that it's humanly possible (and my husband agrees) for a couple to have as much sex as they do. Therefore, new Olympic sport? I also found what I consider a misuse of some words. In particular, in the last book, the author describes Ana as \\"scrambling\\" to unbutton Christian's shirt. For goodness sake, you scramble eggs or scramble to gather your children. You \\"deliberately taunt him while you slowly unbutton his sweaty shirt\\". The last book was admittedly the best. Some intrigue, some heroism. That's good. The entire trilogy could be summed up as \\"naive girl meets experience, kinky guy. Girl loves guy and tries to reform him. Guy responds in a positive manner and they live happily ever after.

B000SEGUDE|5.0|This novel is so well-written that it literally drops you into the middle of someone's life -- and rips you out just as abruptly -- but compels you to keep reading to learn more about the individual you just met. And this same experience happens more than once. Somehow the author weaves together time and character, theme and circumstance, into one seamless fabric that flexes and warps but remains a thrilling and moving whole. I cannot imagine the movie doing this book justice, it is that beautifully written and structured. But I remain open to the possibility!
B002VISN9E|1.0|READ  THIS<br />I gave it one star because i wanted to get your attention cos i just got to tell you that this book is great ,pay no attention to the people who have rated it one star they are totally wrong ,  i totally recomed this book, its good for 9 and under its a totally cute book it has fantasy humor and all that kind of stuff , one of My favorite parts was when she lernt how to read when she was only

B0061PEAUY|5.0|As is usual with all of the Kathy Reichs books it was an enjoyable read.  THe story moved along and had a couple of surprises. I would wish for the relationship between Tempe and Andy Ryan to pick up again. would make it more enjoyable.

0061146307|1.0|There is nothing amusing, educational, nor entertaining about a story in which a family loses their parents when their house burns down, they are taken by a wicked relative who tries to trick the 14-yr old girl to marry him so he can get his hands on their great fortune, the 18-month old is hung from a tower in a cage, they live in filth and abject poverty where only one of them has a bed while waiting to receive said fortune, etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />It isn't like there is EVER a redemption of any sort nor any lesson of any kind.  I have no desire to impose such a depressing, tale on anyone--never mind on one of our precious little ones.<br /><br />I have had great difficulty forcing myself to complete the first one in order to provide an evaluation of it.  My daughter gave me two more to review for her 9-year old.  I know how she is raising her children, and I am fully confident she will agree that they do not need to read anything like this.  Sometimes we have truly different opinions, but I don't think that will be the case this time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|So much better than the movie! I couldn't stop reading it. I didn't quite give it five stars because I feel as though it could've ended better in regards to it being a series. I am not driven to read the second one. I will only read it in hopes that it will be just as good as the first. I just feel that it needed something left hanging at the end to compel the audience to read the following book.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|Another title could be Fifty Shades of Boredom.  Read the first two.<br />Books not well written.<br />Didn't capture one's attention - characters not credible, nor admirable.<br /><br />Think E L James tried to emulate Janet Evanovich at times, but not in Evanovich class.  Perhaps James should take some more literary lessons from Evanovich and Jodi Picoult (eg Picture Perfect).<br /><br />Sandy
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|What I enjoyed about this show was even though it was long I never got bored or wished it would get over it.
B001O7JHVG|4.0|This is one of those movies you can tell clearly was a product of the 80s. Something about it just has that 80s vibe about it. Which is no bad thing for me though.<br /><br />Tango and Cash is a 1989 action/buddy-cop movie that deals with two police officers, Ray Tango and Gabe Cash (Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell, respectively), who are great at what they do. Unfortunately for one drug lord, TOO great as the two separately have cost him millions each. To protect his empire and those who have interests in it, Tango and Cash are both (all the while unknown to the other) lured to the same location where they are then framed for the murder of an FBI agent. Found guilty by several corrupt officials, the two are sentenced to 18 months and are instead of sent to a far rougher prison than they were expecting. The two then escape and must find out who has framed them and prove their innocence.<br /><br />Watching it, it's immediate it was never going to be an Oscar contender for best screenplay. But is it a fun and enjoyable watch? For me, the answer is yes. It's the kind of movie I could see just grabbing some popcorn on a quiet Friday night and popping in my blu-ray player. I enjoyed and I expect repeat viewings in the future.<br /><br />Both Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell played their parts great. Teri Hatcher is also in this in one of her earliest roles (five years later, she would go on to play Lois Lane in the TV series \\"Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\\" for four years) and she did good in her scenes as well.<br /><br />Funny enough, there's several in-jokes in the movies to past roles. One example that made me laugh was at the beginning after Tango (Stallone) has stopped these two criminals. A sheriff's deputy is angry over his handling of it and is screaming \\"Who do you think you are!?\\" to which another officer jokingly replies, \\"He thinks he's Rambo!\\" Everyone else, Tango included, quietly look at him.<br /><br />Bottom line is, it's an 80saction movie. You almost know what to expect. Should you give it a watch? I would definitely say yes.

However, I was certainly pleased to see the book on Kindle.<br />Finished it just a short time ago and see that Bosch is still great enough to work a case with thoroughness and ease..very impressive, as were all of his adventures that I had the good fortune to read!<br /><br />Well written and detailed enough to please any \\"wannabe\\" detective. Thanks!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Read in the context of the Holocaust or Shoah, Sarah's Key is a gripping tale of loss, survival, deep grief and new life. The tale unfolds with many surprises that save it from deep depression and despair. The best surprise of all is at the end. Moving as it is unexpected. An incredibly good read.
B0089J29C6|4.0|This review is for the film and then for the blue-ray disc. The film itself is a classic comedy. Marilyn Monroe is truly amazing as a first-class comedienne, with both dialogue as well as physical comedy.. Each of the three actresses have their own small bit that references their real lives, which brings on a laugh or two. Betty Grable thinks she hears Harry James (her real life husband) on the radio. Lauren Bacall talks about \\"that guy in 'African Queen'\\" (refering to her real life husband Humphrey Bogart). And while in a fashion show, Marilyn Monroe is seen in a bathing suit with accents of diamonds, which the commentor makes reference to by saying \\"we all know 'diamonds are a girl's best friend'\\" (of course bringing to mind Marilyn's big break-out film, \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\\"). The supporting male performers hold their own very well, especially William Powell and, in a smaller but very funny role, Fred Clark. My one complaint is with the blue-ray disc, not the film itself. The true scope of the film is not shown, There are a few scenes where the sides of the frame are noticeably \\"squeezed in\\". It's like the 255:1 ratio (stated on the packaging) was crammed into a 235:1 frame. Why do that? If you're going to release a film in high quality blue-ray, then do so with it's true full scope. Because of that flaw the disc gets 4 stars instead of 5.
B000KC8O3S|5.0|I'm a very huge DW fan, ever since my Dad first introduced me to it. I've even started watching the very first episodes from the first Doctor on. This soundtrack feeds my DW addiction as well as my orchestral music addiction. As always, Murray Gold's music is amazing and I listen to it constantly. <3
B002MQYOFW|4.0|author has created an interesting alternate universe peopled by amazing heroic characters. katniss is one of the best heroines in today's literature.
B005LAIH54|4.0|It's the final years of the ruling of Gods and when Hades (Ralph Feinnes) and Ares (Edgar Ramirez) decide to imprison Zeus (Liam Neeson) so they can raise Kronos - Zeus and Hade's father - in exchange for their immortality, Perseus (Sam Worthington) rides back into action to stop the destruction of humanity.<br /><br />If you liked 2010's `Clash of the Titans', which I did, then you'll enjoy `Wrath of the Titans' as well. The film brings back the hammy acting, campy dialogue and dodgy accents that came with the first instalment. The action itself drives the movie and tries to reach the same grand spectacle of `Clash' and, for the most part, succeeds, pitting Perseus and his faceless, cannon fodder companions against big, mythical, creatures that are usually faster and stronger than they are. It's the perfect movie for a night-in of mindless action, those who watched `Clash' will know exactly what to expect, those who haven't should know to check their brain at the door, sit back and enjoy the chaos.<br /><br />I watched the three deleted scenes on the disc, mildly interesting, they weren't really action bits so I can see why they cut them out.

B0091XRL86|1.0|Dont waste your time or your money with this movie. Not funny, a total miss. Get Ice Age or How to Train Your Dragon.
030758836X|2.0|It is well-written from the perspective of structure, plot twists and perhaps even in commentary on modern society. Ultimately, however, the book lacks a soul. None of the characters are very believable and therefore hard to identify with. I had to finish it for book club or I wouldn't have. It felt like climbing into a dirty carnival ride every time I picked it up.
B008CP93S0|5.0|I liked this movie a lot. I spoke to a lot of people who also saw it. Their first comment was that it was silly. But after 10 min. If recapping scenes they were laughing hard. It is silly and very funny. Paul Rudd is the best.
B008C0C1Y8|4.0|While critics and fanboys alike roasted the Sylvester Stallone version of Judge Dredd I found that the movie was very entertaining.<br /><br />First, the city looks MEGA.  This looks like a futuristic city where tens of millions of people live.  The look of the movie is great.  Second, the plot is solid.  The story itself is actually quite good.  Third, the cast is excellent.  Stallone is ideal as a big screen Dredd, while Armand Assante, Diane Lane, and Max Von Sydow give fantastic performances.<br /><br />What's the drawback?  Rob Schneider.  His performance is a little too comic, and he goes just a little too far over the top.  Plus, his character has about 10 minutes too much screen time.  Thus, like Jar Jar Binks, he (for many people) ruins the movie.  Then again, his character goes a long way towards humanizing Dredd and reminding him that justice sometimes means following the spirit of the law, not just the letter of the law.  What is right and just isn't always what is specifically written in the law.  By the end of the movie Dredd learns this thanks to Fergie.<br /><br />But even though Dredd IS humanized he is still an engine of destruction taking out the lawless.  Even at the end, where Dredd has been humanized, he is still a nearly unstoppable force out to bring justice to Mega City One.<br /><br />Yes, this version of Judge Dredd borders on camp. BORDERS on camp.  It doesn't cross that line the way, say, Demolition Man did.  It may have a few campy moments, but there is still a serious movie in here among the bits of humor and campy over the top characters.<br /><br />Judge Dredd may not be a great movie, but it is good, and it is VERY entertaining.  And the blu ray looks a lot better than the original DVD did.  A lot better.
B001P5M7QE|4.0|I bought this movie to replace the physical copy I had a few years ago that doesn't work anymore, and I was happy with the quality.

B008EKON56|5.0|I am Graphic Designer and I sit 12-14 hours a day designing and most of the time, locked-in and bunker-ed down.  So you can imagine how important it is to be properly equipped.  Having the right portable rig and a good set of cans, makes it all more endearing (most can do with an iphone/pod and some simple buds, BUT NOT ME! :p ).<br /><br />I was using a 4th Gen 32gb iPod touch with a Fiio L9 connected to a Fiio E17 (before that an E7) with 90% of the music in FLAC, AIFF, and ALAC. Using that much of lossless on an iPod can really put a strain the battery life.  It would barely make it to the 11th hour (sometimes less), then I would have to put it on the charger and do away with the E17 making me a grumpy worker (I know, I'm picky heh).<br /><br />The L11 has solved this almost year long problem.  After two days of using it... I'm all smiles now! The constant conscience thought of my iPod dying is now non-existent. Now, I don't even have to put the iPod on standby and because it's dark where I work I let it blast on with full brightness :).<br /><br />Oh and if you are wondering... ZERO feedback while charging (at least I haven't heard any yet). I tried my co-workers LOD (I think it was a Sendstation), pretty cool at first but, there was a tiny buzzing sound while charging while used in conjunction with an amp. The L11 performs flawlessly in this regard.<br /><br />All in all good job Fiio! I'm loving this very much.<br /><br />(Update: 09/17/13)<br />For the most part, it still does what its suppose to do and I still use it in the same fashion.  Although my Ipod touch can barely last 2 hours without it now (no surprise).  One thing I have noticed with it though, in comparison to the L9, the L9 sounds a tad warmer than the combination L11 and Monster iCable 800 that I currently use.  I thought it was the iCable but there was no difference between it and an L8 cable.  I also use this in the car and like others have stated, a much better and fuller sound. Kind of likeI was 10 rows back and now I am sitting in the front row.<br /><br />But all in all, still a great product I recommend!

1594203334|4.0|I enjoyed this book. The author has a breezy writing style and infuses humor effortlessly. She's honest in opening up about her experiences raising children as an American living in France. In the book, she contrasts \\"French parenting\\" with American parenting. I put \\"French parenting\\" in parentheses, because to me, what she's describing doesn't seem limited to the French--rather it's common-sense parenting. Of course children should develop good sleep habits; of course they should have limits; of course they should be introduced to many different types of food. I think the let-the-child-be-in-charge \\"American\\" parenting the author describes is more a parenting style of elite groups of American parents than one of American parents in general.<br /><br />Still, there are notable differences between raising children in France vs. the US, such as the availability of great daycares in France but also less emphasis on breast feeding there.<br /><br />All in all, an insightful, well-written non-fiction read.

0525953728|5.0|Honestly, a great book! Whether or not he came out and said it was all fake or altered, great written book. I do not understand why some people hate on this guy. Everything he wrote in the book was already online, his story was just more well put together and he was part of the raid too. Few more details but nothing that could be taken as vital info that violates some sort of secrecy that wasn't already put out by the media.<br />Over all, the book was put together quite well. It keeps you reading, I lost sleep just to keep reading this book! Sure he doesn't talk about the Osama mission much until the end, but I still think it was interesting. And who cares if he doesn't support or supports Obama, we all have our opinions. Just like these reviews. I say just give this book a chance, its definitely worth that much.

B008CP6RWU|3.0|I'm not sure really why the other reviewers are so in love with thatgamecompany's Journey: Collector's Edition, a six game pack of games from Sony and thatgamecompany. Although the game features fantastic visuals and music, the meat of the games is just not there. Other than flOw, which has some gameplay, Journey and Flower are really nothing more than high concept tech demos.<br /><br />Journey throws you into the game, as a hooded individual following a shooting star heading to a mountaintop in the distance, and you set off to see what it is. What I have gathered is that you really need to watch the included 30 minute documentary about the game to truly understand what the developers were getting at. That's ridiculous. If you cannot weave that sort of information into the game itself, you are being too minimalist, eccentric and to be blunt, hipster.<br /><br />And so you head off into the direction of the mountaintop. There are no puzzles. There are no enemies except one that can only knock you around, not kill you. There are no deaths. You just go. On the whole, it's very shallow and hardly a game at all. And that's really the problem here. Those looking for a relaxing, meditative experience need to find some ambient music and some weed. This is supposed to be a game. It's not.<br /><br />But, for barely being a game, it presents itself well. The visuals are quite nice and the soundtrack is top notch. However, it does not make up for the lack of an actual game. The controls are passable, brought down by the always-on nature of Sixaxis support. The 'multiplayer' is not anything remotely close to multiplayer in any sense of the gaming word. It's a minimalistic version of the Demon's Souls multiplayer, if you can even call it that. I don't see how you are supposed to have any attachment and comradeship to someone you cannot interact with or work with in any way, except for beeping to each other. How is making a journey with someone who has no dependence on you, no teamwork interaction and no attachment supposed to be meaningful?<br /><br />You can almost see the degradation of actual gaming moving from flOw to Flower to Journey. flOw has some fun gameplay, visuals and sound that was only dampened by Sixaxis control. I would actually highly recommend picking that game on its own from PSN - it's the only reason this collection got three stars, not two. Flower may be even less of a game than Journey. If you told me this was a demo to demonstrate Sixaxis control and not an actual game, I wouldn't question it for a second.<br /><br />I did try the three minigames included, but since they are strictly local multiplayer titles, I did not really get to play them as intended.<br /><br />I will probably get roasted for this review, but this is how I see it and as someone who has been playing games for almost 30 years, I can't possibly recommend this collection. If you're looking for deeper, meaningful titles that you actually can experience and play, try Braid or Limbo. They are actually games!
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Bought the book for my wife from Amazon for our Kindle.  She did not feel that she would enjoy the book from the cover.  However she started reading the book and had a hard time putting the book down before she finished the whole story.  She has recommended the book to a number of her friends who enjoy reading historical fiction.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like this game a lot! Reminds me of being at the fair. I am an adult. I would continue to play but it takes too darn long to rebuild your coin count!! So I play my others. Therefore I must give it only four stars. Price for buying coins is ridiculous. For as fast as coins are used in gameplay....it is a rip off.
B000FC0V3E|4.0|Enjoyable especially with Dark Chocolate - perfect with a cup of hot camomile - Ideal for a relaxing Friday night. It was Hemingway's first book. The characters are easy to like. Looking forward to discovering his other books and see his evolution.
B001FEFMVC|1.0|I normally don't take the time to review this program because it is fiction for the purpose of entertainment but this episode did not even contain the basic parts of a story (intro, rising conflict, climax, resolution, conclusion). Nor, did this episode fit in to the larger star gate story line. this was just lazy writing, with zombies and hot chicks to make up for the lack of imagination and skill.
B004EPZ070|5.0|I have watched this movie many times and I love it!  I have also read the reviews.  At first, I compared the movie to the book.  The book was absolutely great; the movie took some creative license.  Even though some people were entranced with Darcy, I thought she was a little much.  Ethan was great!  Dexter and Rachel were just wonderful--their characters were just right in a mixed up relationship.  The acting superb!  I also thought Marcus was a hoot and loved him in the tv series, \\"Reba.\\"  A really decent movie with very little profanity.  Finally!<br /><br />Two books are sequels to this movie, and I hope to see them out in movie form.  Great, Great, Great!!
B004XGN8W4|4.0|This is entertainment on the go! I bought this item in an Amazon blast deal. I'd say this is an excellent buy for all of those who are looking to have their consoles on the go.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Portable and Safe!<br />Although it does not offer you protection against heavy damage to your console (Like trowing your equipment from a second floor, go swimming with it or something). It still provides good protection against minor damage. You can carry safely your console anywhere and the box looks fine. My PS3 Slim and my Xbox fitted great.<br /><br />High Definition!<br />Another pro. Image quality is quite good and it includes an HDMI cable.<br /><br />You can carry accessories!<br />It has two big pouches where you can take all your cables and two controllers with you.<br /><br />Two headphone jacks!<br />Excellent addition when you don't want to disturb people around you.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />All the cables!<br />Cable connections can be a bit uncomfortable, but not so much. The cable to supply power to the screen is in the front, it would've been better at the back.<br /><br />The sound!<br />Although it sounds fairly good, it lacks bass and it has a lot of space for improvement.<br /><br />The settings reset every time!<br />This could be annoying for some people. For example, you had your PS3 hooked to a 42\\" or 55\\" TV. Every time you connect that PS3 to this set, you will have to re-scan HDMI settings so you won't have compatibility issues with some games (resolution issues to be more specifically). Not a major issue, but it could take you two to three minutes to fix.<br /><br />In overall, it's a great buy. I recommend you to buy an extension with at least two plugs (grounded) so it's easier to connect anywhere. If you're looking for entertainment on the go, this product is totally for you, so I'd say go for it. If you are looking for something less bulky, I'd say buy a handled device and don't waste your money on this. Happy buying!
0345803485|1.0|Frigging disgusting. A porn star novel with details that made me throw up in my mouth. Sick, demented, twisted people who seemed to enjoy this. If this is what romance is coming to, I would swear celibacy
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Great grahics and nice game play reminiscent of origional GOW !!!!!!!!!!! smooth flowing transitions in the scenery make this a deight to play my suggestion is to try it and you'll be hooked ;-)~
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I'd become a big fan of Imagine Dragons after I purchased their EP.  This album has the majority of the songs that were on the EP as well as a few other gems.  On the whole, the songs are up-beat and fun.<br />Songs that stand out: Radioactive, Demons, Bleeding Out and Hear Me
B008ODZEQ0|4.0|I like sushi, or perhaps, what I've thought of as sushi.  I've had some perfectly awful stuff---raw fish, and some better stuff, enough to have an idea of what to look for, but I can only wonder what one gets in the rarefied world of Jiro's.  It helps to know something of sushi before you watch this, as the film spends no time on explaining what sushi is, or any real history of the cuisine.  This film is about Jiro, Jiro's restaurant, his oldest son, who will take over the business (eventually, Jiro will die working if he has his way) and his younger son, who having nothing else to do in the family business, opened his own, a more affordable version of the same top flight sushi, but in a more relaxed setting---and designed for a right handed chef, but otherwise the mirror image of his father's place, designed from the other perspective.<br /><br />And that's one of the great things about this film:  You've seen the chefs from hell.  The beastly ones who cuss and shout, demean people in public; treat their employees like slaves, and fawn for the camera.  This is about as different from that as one could imagine.  Eighty-something Jiro and his oldest son (fifty)  go to visit his parent's ashes at a temple.  Jiro remarks \\"I don't know why I come here, they didn't take care of me\\" and his son mock-shushes him \\"You've got to respect your elders!\\".  And yet, after being sent of to school (at 7 or 9, Jiro seems to have forgotten) with his father's admonition \\"You have no home to return to\\", Jiro seems to have quite a nice relationship with both his sons, and his apprentices/employees.<br /><br />Which is another nice thing about this film, nobody talks about how Jiro \\"changed the way the world eats\\" or says any of the preposterous things people say in front of cameras when talking about Alice Waters and the like.  Sushi is presented as food, expertly prepared by a master, but still food, not a religious experience.<br /><br />The \\"more relaxed setting\\" his younger son refers to is the trepidation many visitors have about sitting at the counter with Jiro standing over them.  He does look a bit imperious, but more in the way of a man very concerned with how everything's going than whether or not you're worthy of dining there, as the film makes clear.  Along the way you meet the fishmongers, each one an expert in his field;  the rice merchant, and see what overfishing has done to seafood and sushi.  The size of the fish forty years ago were immense compared to the fish today.<br /><br />All in all, it is a very decent portayal of an obsessive sushi master who nevertheless comes across as a fairly decent guy, not like the usually freakish obsessive.  And his older son seems well set to carry on the family name in Sushi.<br /><br />There are a very few scenes of live fish (in the fish market, only) being cut into,  that may cause unease in some viewers, but they are short and not the focus of the story, so once they pass, they are not repeated, and they are brief.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This story is not your normal vampire and witch love story. The plot keeps you intrigued. A little slow and not much romance but a good read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|At the beginning, it was hard to differentiate between the narrators. Once I figured out who thought what, it became interesting enough to finish, but still had to trudge through it.
B0090EIILU|1.0|I had higher hopes for this movie. The premise is good fodder for a good parody, but the gags were poorly developed. There were a few funny moments, such as the exiled director of the WMD program coming to NYC to work at the Apple Genius Bar. The commercial was funnier than the movie.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|All in all, the movie never explained enough about things that were going on. Perhaps it was because we were trying to watch it while there were three kids in the house, and we missed some things, but we were confused as to what was going on most of the time. We thought the ending was pretty anti-climactic, also. I couldn't help also thinking it was giving a subliminal political message, like it was the 99 percenters against the 1 percenters; the \\"Occupier\\" state of mind.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is an inspiring book for people who need to understand why the extra pounds seem impossible to lose. We all know that processed food is bad, but now we know why. Also, it is so much easier to change just one thing and see great results. If you are interested in optimal health GET THIS BOOK!
B008XCM18Q|5.0|Still one of the best books ever written, do not read it expecting what you saw in the movie, same idea different story
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|I feel embarrassed to admit to people that I am reading a series of fantasies involving a time travelling heroine and her hunk of a 18th century highland Scot husband. Think bodice-ripper. But Gabaldon writes very well, develops real depth in her characters and has thorougly researched her historical period/s. I was thoroughly sucked in by the first two novels - this one has jumped the shark a bit, and personally I don't need so many sex scenes, but is still a damn good read!
B0086700CM|5.0|get this game. its awesome. I love it so much. get it no matter what on a scale of 1-10 I rate it a 600000
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thought the book was very good. I don't know what the big deal was regarding concerns that \\"sensitive\\" material would be released. It seemed that nothing written was detrimental to national security. I am a Navy veteran and I have served with Navy seals at one point. I found them to be a lot of fun and also dedicated to what they did. Unless someone has served in the armed forces, don't criticize what anyone does until you've been in their place.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I've had this app on my Android mobile for a while now, and it's a favourite.  I highly recommend it for astronomy buffs, fishermen &amp; other outdoorsmen, and anyone else who just loves moongazing.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Very helpful application ; makes using pintrest much easier on tablet. Sometimes it has some hiccups and wont respond but that's the only issue I've had.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Miss Minimalist is a convenient compilation of words of wisdom from Francine's popular blog. The book is full of useful advice on how to think about, and go about, downsizing your belongings. Francine has a wonderful tone to her writing, which is always encouraging, and accepting that we all have different ways of doing things. You dont need to be a hardcore minimalist to enjoy Francine's writing, and pick up a few useful ideas.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I can see how the movie may lose a lot of people who did not read the book.  It skipped out on a lot of review and explanation of many things.<br />Good.<br />Not great.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great page turner. Because this book is so unique, I never knew what was going to happen. Hot and steaming and intense, can never go wrong.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Good reacher book. he doesn't get captured or beaten, but is able to kill lots of bad guys. What more can you ask from the great action hero. he is a bit too american in some stylized way.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app. just wish my kindle would leave it on all the time like it use too. my kindle keeps turning it off.
B0061S073A|4.0|It's so great to be able to hand the phone to the kids without worrying that they will make a call or buy an app by accident!
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|Loved the Millenium Series. I read the three books in the order it was written which helped with the flow of the story. There were stages when it was heavy going but it all tied up in the end so the details were really needed to tell the whole story. Loved the main character Lisbeth. Her quirky nature was very real and endearing.
B008MM9630|4.0|Got it on kindle fire.  Fun game and no problems running it.  It is a good one to play if you like games you don't constantly have to pay attention to.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Best game ever!!!!!! I bought this just for something to do while I'm bored in class but then BOOM.It is now my favorite game in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very fun game. Sim city type lite game. great for those of us who remember the original. only wish I had an old Mac to play it on
B004UID2LC|1.0|this wont work fix it. you can download 23 songs then it stops.I don't recremend it for kindlefire. it messes everything up.do not get. I'm so notchappy with this app.
1594135851|5.0|After reading book number one of this trilogy I couldn't wait to read this book.  It did not disappoint. A must read.
034580404X|5.0|I was very skeptic at first. I kept hearing it was very, xxx. I also, am just not into the harlequin novels and didn't want to invest in books that were anything like those. (No offense those who do like those.) This series surprised me. I can't say that I have read them, over and over again, but they were a great and easy read. Very descriptive and well, ask any woman, made us look in near by coffee shops and skim the streets for a pretty Audi R8. I loved the series, have recommended it to friends and will continue to do so. It was a great read.
0439023521|5.0|Sat down and couldn't put the book down. I would definitely recommend this book. It is like no other book I have read.
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|dont work i was disappointed ...i tried it at the bar like 6 times an never even came close so dont download it...
159413586X|5.0|This third book did not disappoint me after such good previous books.  My only regret was that it was the last one in the series.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Best book I've read in years. No nonsense account of getting the job done for America. I'm glad this book was released in spite of all the political posturing that occurred.
B0096MM9GG|1.0|This game is unplayable.The controls are horrible.I cant believe Ubisoft would put out such a bad game.Prince of Persia on playstation is great,but this version is completely unplayable.Dont waste your time and money like I did.
B007RI56NY|4.0|Each album by Train seems to get tighter and tighter as an overall collection of songs.  This album tells more autobiographical stories of the band and delivers more colorful references to time and events in the American culture.  The album starts strong with \\"This Will be my Year\\" and then the huge hit \\"Drive By\\".  Those two songs are followed by a pair of quality country crossover candidates \\"Feels Good at First\\" and \\"Bruises\\" (the later features a great duet).  The quirky \\"50 Ways to Say Goodbye has everyone's attention as listeners try to decode the lyrics.  Two other strong songs include the title track \\"California 37\\" (a dark view of marriage and relationships) and \\"Mermaid\\" (a new twist on discovery of new love).  Weaker songs include \\"Sing Together\\" which projects a happy folk taste while \\"You can Finally Meet my Mom\\" touches another quirky theme.  The final two songs \\"We were Made for This\\" and \\"When the Fog Rolls in\\" struggle to mix solid lyrics with the execution of a great tune.  This is probably Train's best collection of songs ever and 8 of the 11 songs will be Train favorites until they release an album to this quality in the years to come.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I wish coins regenerated faster!! This game is addicting. Strangley it takes skill more than luck. It is definately worth a free download. Very few instructions however and something about a puzzle???
B006LSZECO|4.0|I still can't decide how I feel about this book but regardless, I couldn't put it down!  It was amazingly well written, funny, intelligent, and, without a doubt, messed up.  I went back and fourth hating each character until the very end!  I definitely recommend this book!
B0042J6VUS|1.0|I bought this tripod to hold my Samsung Galaxy phone. It was too small and doesn't hold the phone well at all. The grip broke when I tried to insert my phone. A very disappointing purchase.
B007N8RULO|5.0|love this game! I play it for hours on my kindle fire and on my Pc.. a good way to get away for a couple of hours.
B005KXU83G|5.0|I have been a fan of Bob Seger since I was 12. I've worn out copies of 9 Tonight in 8-track, vinyl, and cassette. I'm happy to have it in mp3 now so I can have it on all my devices.<br /><br />When I am old and gray and in a nursing home somewhere, I'll probably still be bopping along to Betty Lou's Getting Out Tonight!
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Foster the People's sound is very unique and I have to admit I like this album a lot! It is only 10 songs but just the uptempo beats and the whole group's voice blends in together. What may be annoying to others, is sweet melody and the sound of greatness in my ear!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was the fastest read for me in years.  Thanks to \\"Mark Owen\\" for details and truth.  I am satisfied that no one was endangered by this book, except maybe the bad guys. Fascinating!
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Great story, it took me until the last page to realize it is a love story. Borrowed the Kindle version through Amazon Prime and will read the other books when the month is over.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Maybe, a guy would like initiative from the lady. The song sounds fun and is fun to dance to when nobody's looking.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|it actually takes s longer time for my kindle fire to die whenever I use this app. it a good choice. I use it everyday
B003EYVY04|3.0|I have been a big fan of the Harry potter series from the start and now that it come to a end its like somthings missing,I've been searching for an extended version of the movies that have the deleted scenes, so when I see the Ultimate edition I will check them out and I am disapointed. Yet when I watch the movies on the television it never fails that I catch a scene that is not in my version. Not to long ago I heared that there was to be a exteneded version and this is what I want, hopefully one day it will become available sooner then later.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a great game. I hate that I need to write a book to say so. What ever happened to just giving something a great rating?
B0083EW97W|4.0|I've really enjoyed Born and Raised.  The songs pull you in with an engaging sound - and keep you around with what seems to be heartfelt lyrics.
B0031207RA|5.0|i have fallen in love with this mount for attaching things to my motorcycle  - use it for my drink holder, iphone holder and other items - makes life so easy
B0042LW58S|5.0|I love this Lego watch just as much as my kids do! It's also waterproof and you just can't go wrong with that!
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|I wish I could rate it zero stars because this game wont even download on my kindle fire.nobody should ever and I mean ever get this game!!!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Not only did my timers get messed up on this great game, but it deleted most of my buildings! Sigh....
1612183956|3.0|Great story minus the distracting references to body parts and weird Mommy party. No one cares about how hard a character's \\"abs\\" are, and women with small children sleeping upstairs generally don't host drunkfests. But the intricate twist makes it worth the read.
0525478817|5.0|John Green has done a good job with this novel, summing up that search for the deep meanings and purposes in lives that are destined for the grave. Many complain that the vocabulary is unrealistic in this book for two teenagers. I think that on the contrary Augustus and Hazel realized that since their life would be so short, they needed to spend more time thinking and learning to experience the world while they still could. I think that this is so appropriate for them as well as us.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I'm surprised at the other reviews as I thought this was a very interesting, plot driven book with a host of characters and some surprises along the way.  I've read all of the Kathy Reich's books and this one reminded me of some of her earlier ones.  It was a little difficult for me to make it through the \\"ick\\" factor of the dead babies but the forensics involved in determining that they were all full term and live births was very interesting.  I also liked that the book took us out of the typical Montreal and Charlotte, SC settings into the wilds of the northern Canadian provinces and, unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the narrative on diamond formation and mining to be very interesting.  It was a good book.  Maybe not the best Reichs has written but not the worst either.  I liked it and will continue to read her books as they come out.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|First book ive read in years. Couldnt put it down.  I highly recomend to anyone who is interested in military books.
B001W04PM6|5.0|The characters are so well written! I just started watching a few weeks ago and I am hooked. Can't stop watching!
0689835604|5.0|My daughter is 4 months old and she enjoys when I read this book to her. She's not old enough to lift the flaps yet so we'll see how it goes.
B006HTUZ1C|1.0|I'd love to give this a good review, but it doesn't work on the Evo 3D. Opens and immediately closes.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really injoy the game one thing I don't like about this game is you being time. if you get rite of that it will be an excellent game
B004IK9SQ0|5.0|Very indepth, renewing, informative. A book that will give more than what you get from church. I highly recommend this book to others that are searching for more insight and a brighter light of knowledge.
0316010669|5.0|Sometimes I wonder if some of us, including me, have extended the blink too long.  Maybe turned it into a nap.  Malcolm provides real insight into the how consiously and unconsiously the world between our ears works.  It is really all about us.  Expanding our awareness, expanding our consiousness is the key to developing the skills and abilities that elevate us.<br /><br />Malcolm wrote a great book to expand our awareness.  Interested in learning more....read the book.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I don't want to write a long review here - there are probably plenty good ones already.  I just wanted to add another positive vote for this excellent, excellent album.  Knopfler and Emmy Lou's voices and styles are a match made in heaven.  I can't remember a duo that worked as well as these two.  I hope they'll do some more albums together.<br /><br />This album has excellent song writing, excellent music, incredible vocals and chemistry between the two.  Oh Lord give us more albums like this one!
B0086VWCPG|5.0|a lot of fun...gps seems solid and accurate enough....motivational tool that helps ...have logged around 100 miles so far....dont know about their German website though
030758836X|3.0|Loved the beginning, a little trashy, but I could live with that.  A KU Jayhawk subtly trashing eastern Missouri and Mizzou fans was harder to take, but the worst was the toxic relationships that abound in the book.  I just wanted to take a shower and wished I could hose it out of my brain when I was done.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app. I can create my own unique sounds by blending several together.  Sleep has never been so sound.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I am a loyal \\"Bones\\" TV series fan and this is the first book by Kathy Reichs' that I have read.  Temperance Brennan seemed less analytical in the book and her personality was warmer and funnier, easier to relate to and the mystery had a lot of twist and turns.  The sexual energy between the two detective and Temperance was refreshing. I would recommend it to those of us that like a good mystery read.
B007C9N4H8|3.0|I like musicals. I don't mind bad musicals.<br />What I was expecting from The Muppets:<br />Fun, Laughter, Cheap Giggles.<br />What I received from The Muppets:<br />Confused children, Awkward hurried explanations of interpersonal (muppet-al?) relations, cheap giggles<br /><br />Directed toward the parents instead more than the kids. If your children pay attention to plot, review your Muppet history or you will be inundated by ill-timed questions.<br /><br />A rent, not a buy.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|I really can't stand the kid that plays Red Mist, but the rest of the movie is good.  Hit Girl is the best!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|VERY GOOD READ !! I remember many of these events and love reading about them now. I do know that there is some equipment that was NOT mentioned that was used and I didn't see any disclosures that should NOT have been made.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Pretty compelling read; fun, entertaining and absorbing.  A little predictable but not enough to make me put it down.  The ending was a little disappointing or weak, but it was still a fun read.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|the line graph of power useage is awesome with this app. you can look at your usage patterns. I would recommend this app. to anyone l.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|The maze runner series is amazing and this book is just as good as the first. Fansastic book! I would definetly recommend that you read this book. Great for fans of The Hunger Game.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I received the book in a timely manner. I have enjoyed it very much. It was in excellent condition. I really never thought about all the ways we view time. Makes one stop and think.
B00973CGXK|5.0|A lot of the reviews here seem to be comparisons to Hot Fuss or Sam's Town, rather than an honest opinion of what Battle Born is like when it stands alone. There's no denying that The Killers' sound has evolved, their lyrics have matured, their sound has become more polished, and you can really see it in this album. At times, they sound just like U2, and at times, just like Bruce Springsteen, but they haven't lost that magic mix of electronica-rock, wailing vocals and great guitar riffs that drew me to them in the first place. My favorites from this album are - The Way It Was (haunting, my heart just breaks when he says 'lonely Esmerelda county line'), Miss Atomic Bomb (prequel to Mr. Brightside, listen to them back to back), Prize Fighter (loved the trumpets in this one, works nicely with the rest of the song),  Deadlines and Commitments (they sound a lot like U2 in this one - its an instrumentally sparse song, which lets the lyrics and the passionate, driving vocals stand out) and Flesh and Blood - Lu Cont remix (the remix was unexpected, but I've grown to love it more than the original version, its a beautiful song). So all in all, I give it 5 stars, I loved Battle Born and highly recommend the Deluxe version.
B0098VXE50|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I didn't think it would be very good but I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm glad I rented it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|love it.  always works!!! has never crashed and is always on target with all forecasts. highly recommend this app to all weather fans...
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This third book did not maintain the taut sexuality of the first two. It degenerated into a typical romance novel with predictable sex scenes.
B00000G3PA|5.0|I purchased this movie on DVD because it is one of my favorite movies and the version I owned was an old VHS.  I had watched the VHS so many times it was about worn out, so I needed a new version.  I LOVE this movie!!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Great Movie!!!  have watched it several times at home, after seeing the movie at the theater when it first came out.
B002KSPKRS|2.0|I'm reviewing my brother's pair of X41's. He has the mic, I have the controller and xbox.<br /><br />I originally had the XLC's, but they broke. When I first used the X41's, I was pretty happy with it. So was my brother. To this day, he doesn't have a problem with it. I on the other hand, despise it. Sure, they're comfortable, and the surround sound is amazing. But there's just one thing that made me glue my old XLC's back together so I could use them instead. That annoying popping and crackling.<br /><br />No matter what I do, I can't get it to stop. When I put them on, they start popping and crackling nonstop. I could barely hear my friend, and concentrate on the game, nonetheless, my own thoughts. When my brother puts them on, they stop. Wtf.<br /><br />So yeah. They're great. Comfortable, clear sounds, surround sound is great, no wires... But the crackling and popping made me stop using it. I just plugged my XLC's into the wire jack thingy in the wireless adapter and I'm good to go. Although they're not as comfortable, and the sound is just a bit worse, they work.<br /><br />$140 gone to waste.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|After seeing the movie, \\"Searching for Sugarman\\" I bought his album \\"Cold Cut\\" from amazon. I experience much pleasure listening to it. Rodreguiz's life story and music are fascinating.<br />Amazon purchased album.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|An amazing tale! unsurpassed passion, dedication, and hard work. This guy is working day and night at 82! incredible! Must watch
B0063IH60K|1.0|plus the ads are getting more difficult to get out of.  had this game for quite awhile but now find the ads a huge turn off.  will delete off all my devices.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|You will be completely taken by this book. I am not an avid reader :-( but I can tell you this much. I totally enjoyed reading these books, I couldn't put them down.<br />You'll never want to wake from your dreams.<br />P.S. It will definately wake up your inner goddess.
B008XG1X18|3.0|There seems to be an issue connecting sometimes.  But once it connects it is wonderful. I am a Pinterest addict.
B008YRTWM8|1.0|We shut this movie off.  It was ridiculous and embarrassing for Denzel Washington.  It could have essentially been a good story, but the graphic unrelated scenes distracted from any value the movie may have had.
B00913DPW2|1.0|I really wanted to love this game.  I am addicted to mystery games and this one looked so good.  The graphics were so beautiful, the music was a nice compliment, but this game just wasn't any good.  It had a great idea, but the story is all laid out for you in the form of a journal at the very beginning of the game, after that you're on your own.  There is nothing to move the story forward.  You wander around picking up items, and trying to figure out what to do, there is no further interaction with anything to move the story forward.  Nothing points you in the direction you should go, or hints as to what you should do next.  Interaction with the ghosts would have been fun, and could have served to move the story along.  I didn't finish the game, but I figure I was half way through it, and there was none.  The games have no context as to whether they are solved from a previous clue, or if you have to just figure them out on your own.  It is very disjointed.  I found myself constantly referring to the walk through to see if I missed anything, or where I was supposed to go next.  Toggling between the two was so annoying I didn't even bother finishing the game.  Which is a shame.  It was a good idea, great story.  I see what they were trying to do, but the execution was bad.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I have read every reacher book and nearly every one of them has been excellent . A Wanted Man unfortunately was not up to Lee Childs usual standard .Only at the end of the book  the story got exciting, when usually  it's  all the way through. A bit disappointing.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|There truly is nothing negative anyone could ever say about MM, no matter which season you are talking about. We are SO thankful to have had the opportunity to purchase season five from Amazon!!! Now we have the long long wait for SEASON SIX!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing. The story was exceptionally made, this is a character driven book and was so good. This Is a book you will not regret buying.
B0084IHVC0|5.0|I loved this movie as a child.  Now, as a 25 year old adult, it is still fun to watch.  Product arrived when expected and is of great quality.
B005NFW0U0|1.0|There seems to be a problem with the streaming on an android tablet, so seeing as I can't watch it, I give it one star.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|just what I wanted...just a simple calculator...no fancy buttons. I am surprised how often I use it.  I checked out of calculator apps before I picked this one.
0345803485|5.0|Putting the writing style aside, I loved the book.  This subject matter isn't for everyone, but it was definitely for me.  Thank you Ms. James for waking me up from what felt like a 10 year sleep.  I read the book twice.  It inspired me to make some lifestyle changes and I must say I've never been happier.  Again, this subject matter isn't for everyone and the actual relationship within the book appears to be emotionally abusive.  I didnt care for the writing style either.  But with that said I would recommend it to with the advice to keep an open mind.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|Using on an Acer A100 and it works like a champ. I use it to update Word docs and Excel spreadsheets and everything works as expected.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun in a brainless way. Obviously, they want you to spend real money to buy &quot;coins&quot;, but you can still play without spending any money. Just keep an eye on your kids!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Real and believable. Owen tells what really happened and how it felt. This is the best book by a former SEAL, gritty and human .
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|A Wanted Man is better than recent Reacher stories as it is more believable.  If you can believe that an ex-army MP Major would hitch hike around America constantly, then it is somewhat believable that he could get picked up by a group of people with connection to a crime recently committed.  In this story Reacher does not take on a dozen men and beat them single handed.  In recent stories Mr Child has made him super human and I was reluctant to read further stories.  I liked the early stories where there was more intelligence from Reacher, as opposed to brawn, but the fights sequences were still interesting when they were believable.  Let's hope that Mr Child finds some new settings for Reacher to use his investigation experience.  This story is his best for some time.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|So after devouring the first book in this series, I immediately bought one Foot in the Grave, which continues the story of Cat and Bones. Cat has a new boss now and a new support team, but we know where her heart and mind really are. The energy and intensity is still high and the action is non-stop.<br /><br />If you like the Sookie Stackhouse stories, you'll love this series. It's not as dark and even more fun. Jeaniene Frost maintains her strong writing style and great story flow, and gives us more insights into this crazy world she's created. Love it! Not for the kiddies to read...
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|The first Iron Man was pretty good, now there's Iron Man 2 which is amazing! I love Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and the film is one of my favs.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|In my opinion one of the best sci-fi movies ever. I love it especially when I am an enormous sci-fi fan. Even if you are not still a great movie with a lot of suspense.
B00067TVHU|5.0|The dynamic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost can often at times be annoying, but when they are on they are really funny, and in this movie they're really funny.  The world or as it's known in the movie -- London (well, people who live in London do think the entire world consists of only London) -- is overtaken by a virus that turns people into zombies, and because God has a terrible sense of humor he decides that two people who aren't going to be turned into zombies are a store supervisor who lives his live as though he were half a zombie (Simon Pegg) and his out-of-work buddy who lives his life as a doped-up video game zombie.  In the first half of the movie it takes a while for our two heroes to realize that people around them are turning into zombies because they're so busy screwing up their lives during the day and hanging out at the Winchester Pub in the evening.  When they finally realize that the world is now trying to eat them they decide the safest place to go is the Winchester Pub where they plan to down some Guinness while the world somehow sorts itself out.<br /><br />This is a movie that can be at times really funny and clever, and because it's a movie starring Simon Pegg it can at times be extremely annoying.  This is a movie that despite Simon Pegg and Nick Frost holds itself together, and it's an entertaining watch.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is by far the best battery monitor I have found so far. It tells you exactly how much time you have left for all of the features!!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I have enjoyed using the Pinterest application very much.  At times it has trouble opening, but when it does open, it works well.  The only drawback is that you cannot expand the size of the picture while on the app as you can while using your browser.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I was kinda sad when I finished. Wish it could keep going...I love it.... I can't wait until I get part 2.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I bought this book after seeing an interview with Jaycee on TV.  She is truly an inspiration to all.  She survived 18 years with her kidnappers and raised two daughters, living in a tent in a backyard.  The book gives one insight on just how the authorities failed this girl many times.  This book will make you believe in hope.
B008XG1X18|5.0|the app is great. was thrilled to see if for kindle fire. it had minor delays but nothing more then I have on my android.
B0000844I8|5.0|I saw this movie by itself a long time ago and was not impressed. The first part was really good but at the time the second part did not impress me.<br /><br />After watching years of SG-1 and putting in context this gets the highest rating. Proof that sometimes it takes more than an initial impression to get it. Therefore I gladly admit I was wrong to not appreciate it. This is top notch Sci-Fi.<br /><br />It sets the stage for years of one of the most imaginative series ever done. One that goes way beyond the simple conflict many stories have. It brings different races, different ideas and much more.<br /><br />The best thing about it is there are two great series with many seasons; many movies and more. So you are not going to run out of good stuff anytime soon :-)<br /><br />If you are a fan of SG-1 and have not watched this then do it! If you want to start the experience then start with this.<br /><br />If you want a stand alone movie don't bother.
B004UID2LC|5.0|it is uncommon software to have because it has many features and other way of hearing your favorite songs.  in addition way more than one think.
B008D1LVRY|5.0|Great album! They just keep getting better. Rock is not dead! Great Mix! Great party music! Can't wait to see what they come up with next!
B00785P2QC|3.0|the game can be very enjoyable but has its diapointments. The investment thing limits me from a lot of land spread and building cooperation. besides that it is very fun.
B007RI56NY|3.0|The tracks that made it to the charts such as \\"Drive By\\" and \\"50 Ways to Say Goodbye\\" are the best of the bunch. There are a few other fun ones like \\"Mermaid\\" But the others are not very compelling. I had a hard time listening through the whole album. If you have to have the songs you know and like, buy them separately.
B008XG1X18|4.0|ok I love this app. If only it didnt freeze and force to close all the time. Ti's  truly sad. I cannot wait till this frequent misfortune is fixed. I'm addicted.
B00007KGCW|3.0|I was very dissapointed when I received the DVD to find I couldn't play it on my DVD player.  I had never heard of different Regions.  I know that you advertised it that way but it didn't mean anything to me.  What an expensive mistake since our DVD player could not be reconfigured to this Region.  I was pleased to find that I could play it on my PC so not all was lost.  But watching on a small monitor is just not the same as watching it on the TV.  The movie is great and I have learned a lesson which I have passed on to other people.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this calculator is so neat and easy to use it really comes in hand.I really  recommend to every problems that u have with math I even use it at the store.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|This is a great game. it justs need a little more something to it. Something i can't my finger on. It gets a little boring after placing for a little while. There is not much variation, as far a playing, between the different the worlds.
B001K3JF7K|4.0|If I had to choose again my path in singing I would choose the path that Diana Krall chose.<br />Jazz is my second precious music favorite after the Opera and both give me great pleasure to perform and listen to.<br />This particularly CD has this unpretentious way about it. The voice is smooth, law keys were chosen, husky timbre of voice.<br />One of my favorite songs in this Album is ' Let's face the music and dance' known to us in it's beautiful version of Nat Kind Cole.<br />This is a great CD to lighten candles, pour some wine and just relax into it.<br />I don't recommend it when you are driving...give it the space it needs. If I had to choose again my singing Jazz singing teacher it would be Diana Krall[[...]]
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game a lot its fun to play the games and than buy the others with the points u have.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read! It's tied with the first Hunger Games! You are going to have to read the next book right after you finish this one! Amazing!It just makes you \\"hungry\\" for more!
B0090EKRKU|5.0|The entire family enjoyed the Lorax.  Dr.suess is amazing always teaching children and adults how to treat others and our earth in a fun humorous way!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|There are enumerable mindless hack-n-slash and shoot-em-up games out there (and also a few great games of these categories), but very few stories provide a solid story.  999 is one of the few rare games that DOES provide a fantastic story; one of the greatest I have come across in fact.  The story was boarded by the same person who boarded Ever 17: The Out of Inifity's story (which is an all time favorite of mine) so I am not surprised by its superiority.
B004LROMX4|5.0|This series reminds me of \\"The Walking Dead\\" Sci-Fi version.  If you enjoyed the AMC series you'll definitely like this show.  Just finished watching Season 2 and wow it just gets better.
B008QTUPUW|5.0|Homeland is Amazing and is my new favorite series!  Claire Danes' performance is AMAZING. The show is very realistic and believable. I'm on the edge of my seat during each episode. Claire Danes' plays a CIA agent (Carrie) who struggles with a psychological disorder,  which she has been hiding from the Agency otherwise she fears they will fire her from her position.  She suspects a recently saved POW (Sgt. Brody) has turned on the U.S.A. and is now working for the enemy.  Sgt. Brody is rescued from being imprisoned for 8 years and is decorated with praise and glory from his Country so her suspicions are not well received.  She takes matters into her own hands and hires \\"outside help\\" to bug Brody's house so that she can spy on him to \\"prove\\" her suspicions.  She watches him and his family through a Monitor which is set up at her house (keeping in mind, what she is doing is highly illegal).  As Brody becomes more popular she becomes more frustrated to prove her suspicions.  But are they suspicions or is Brody really hiding something? Is she just crazy or is there something very secretive going on that no one is aware of...except Carrie.  This show has so many twists and turns you will never know what to expect and just when you think you've figured it out - another twist comes along.  The show is written in such a way that it is easy to follow - not a crazy amount of dialogue where you get lost just trying to keep track of all the characters or details.  It is beautifully written, extremely well acted, and amazingly realistic. I highly recommend Homeland and am looking forward to Season 2.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Amazing I love this game. Some levels are challenging but still fun! They should make the balloon levels harder.  And add more regular levels
B008G33PMI|4.0|Tarja gives us a fun, energetic live CD set.  I've been listening to it regularly, especially since the release of the DVD and Blu-ray isn't until the end of October for the U.S.  The set is taken from two concerts that were professionally recorded and filmed at the Teatro el Circulo in Argentina.  It's a beautiful old theater that also hosts operas, and it's a good setting for Tarja's music.  Tarja's voice is in top form here, and it's easy to appreciate the passion and hard work she puts into her peformances.  I've always been impressed with how well she sings live.  Her band is also in top form.  Tarja has surrounded herself with talented musicians, and it's even more obvious listening to the live versions of her songs than on the studio recordings.  I find myself enjoying the live versions of many of the songs more than the original recordings.<br /><br />Highlights for me include \\"In For a Kill\\", \\"Until My Last Breath\\", \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\", \\"Crimson Deep\\", \\"Never Enough\\", and \\"Oasis / The Archive of Lost Dreams\\".  I have to admit to a couple of low points.  I wasn't feeling \\"Nemo\\", \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", or the 80s medley - though I think they're still listenable.  With \\"Phantom\\", I don't think the voice of the male singer they chose really blended with Tarja's, and I don't think he sung his part well.  With \\"Nemo\\", I just think Tarja's voice sounded a bit off during this song.  She didn't sing it badly, but she has sung it better.  Sometimes I actually find myself skipping this song on the CD, but part of that is because I think \\"Nemo\\" has been overplayed, and it's never been among my favorite Nightwish songs.  The 80s medley is fine until she gets to \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\".  IMO, that song doesn't suit her voice.  But she does sound like she's having a lot of fun singing it.<br /><br />Something I wanted to point out is that the CD set does not contain every songs that are on the DVD and Blu-ray.  The omitted songs are: \\"The Reign\\", an acoustic set,and two band instrumentals.  I can understand not including the band instrumentals, although they are good performances, but I wish \\"The Reign\\" and the acoustic set had been included.  I've seen these performances from the DVD, and both are very beautiful.  It's a shame they aren't on the CD set.  The acoustic set is a ~10-minute medley of \\"Rivers of Lust\\", \\"Minor Heaven\\", \\"Montanas de Silencio\\", \\"Sing For Me\\", and \\"I Feel Immortal\\".  The other nitpick is that the CD set includes fives covers.  A little odd that this many were included, apparently at the expense of original songs.  If not having room for all the songs was an issue, then I would've preferred that \\"The Reign\\" and acoustic set were included in place of some of the covers.  Just personal preference.  At least they're on the DVD and Blu-ray.  This did impact my rating a bit, and that's because I think those two pieces are stronger performances than three covers mentioned above.  I do enjoy \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" and \\"Still of the Night\\" though and think they were worth including in the CD set.<br /><br />Finally, J. Lamb and BJW have a point about the sound.  I agree the bass gets overpowering at times.  It doesn't prevent me from enjoying the music, but it's noticeable.  I still think it's worth buying; it's a fantastic set.  And I'll be buying the DVD once it's released.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|this series has never let me down- a fun time to watch. got it for my lil bro and he just loves it! i hope i can watch more of it soon to see what happens next :)

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was disappointed to reach the end of the series. The books were riveting. I Loved all three of them.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Another great book by Brandon Sanderson. This is a striking novel in the Mistborn trilogy. This trilogy is a definite must read for any fantasy reader.
B0009VSB06|4.0|I really can't complain about the Garrett ACE 150.  This is a very good entry level detector for the kids or weekend warrior.  It is pretty sensitive on dry land but a bit too sensitive on the beach.  It is very simple to use and well constructed.  The detector is very light but it doesn't feel cheap.  Overall I think it is a good buy.
B005QWJWYC|5.0|I JUST LOVE THIS SHOW! IT MAKES ME HAPPY. ITS A GREAT GREAT SHOW. EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH THIS! ITS A LOVE STORY, ITS FUNNY & ITS ACTON PACKED. I HOPE THEY NEVER TAKE THIS SHOW OFF.

B007ZI06FE|5.0|When her father was murdered and the Blue Blood responsible put a price on her head, Honoria Todd slipped out of the city proper with her younger sister and brother. They disappeared into the rookeries, into the fringe of life on the edge of Whitechapel. For six months she's been using an assumed name and practically starving as she works to the bone to feed her family and keep her brother's illness at bay.<br /><br />The rookeries have their own version of a king, and no one dares cross the rogue Blue Blood known as Blade. If you're under his protection, no one would dare hurt you. If you're an enemy, the angels themselves couldn't save you. And as Honoria scurries home from her much-needed job, hiding herself along the journey to keep secret where she lives, one of Blade's people waylays her and lets her know a chilling fact. She's been summoned for an audience with the king.<br /><br />Blade's viral count is dangerously high. He's already showing signs of the first symptoms of the Fade, that slow, inexorable descent into madness that will change him from man to monster, from blood-drinking ruler of the rookeries to mindless, ravening vampire. He doesn't have much time left.<br /><br />Blade views Miss Todd, and yes, he knows who she really is, as a pawn. He's aware that his most reviled enemy, the member of the Echelon responsible for his infection and, ultimately, his sister's death, is hunting Honoria and her siblings. The price on their heads, most notably Honoria's, is extremely high.<br /><br />He doesn't know why...yet...but he'll find out. And he'll use that knowledge to get what he wants. That's what he does. That's what he has always done. Then again, he's never before met anyone quite like Honoria Todd. And as he gets to know the fiercely prim warrior that challenges and resists him at every turn, even when exhausted and half-starved, he comes to realize something almost miraculous for it's simple truth. The king of the rookeries, battle-hardened gang leader and borderline monster, has met his match.<br /><br />But with a voracious vampire cutting a bloody, deadly swath through Whitechapel and his own Fade creeping ever closer, the damnable truth is that it may just be too late for him. It may be too late for them all.<br /><br />~*~<br /><br />Wow, what a spectacular debut this was! I loved everything about it. The world was gritty, dangerous, and dark, the characters were full of strength and passion and furious honor...even as they danced along the gray line between black and white, and the story was action-packed, dangerous, and powerfully emotional. Hands down this is one of my top three reads of the year to date. I'm definitely the most excited I've been about a new series in a very long time.<br /><br />I'm still sort of a steampunk neophyte, so I don't have a large reservoir of material to compare, but I loved the mix of steampunk and paranormal in this fantastic romance. The steampunk elements were fairly low key, which might bother true enthusiasts, but my largest passion is paranormal romance, so this worked just fine for me. I'd even suggest the steampunk-curious try this one to get their toes wet. I think it would be a good way to delve into the genre.<br /><br />The whole grimy, soot-stained, virus-ridden world felt deliciously fresh and original, and I adored what was a completely new take on both vampire and werewolf mythos here. The ruling Echelon, with their infected blood rites and power-hungry House structure, was freaky-scary in concept. Considering they were knowingly and enthusiastically infecting themselves with a virus that demands blood-drinking and would lead to their eventual destruction when the virus overwhelms them, it all seemed a rather profound statement on the vagaries of vice and power.<br /><br />I loved it.<br /><br />And Honor and Blade were fantastic main characters. Honor was everything I could have ever dreamed. Fierce, intelligent, independent, proud, she was both a freethinker and riddled with prejudice and fear, stubborn and generous in equal measures. She sometimes took wild, dangerous risks, throwing herself into battle for those she loved, and she would defend them to the death. She stood up to Blade, a man who is everything that most terrifies her, even when he had her completely at his mercy. I liked her as a person and respected the hell out of her character, even when her obstinacy regarding Blade started to really frustrate me.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this book was that it wasn't just me that it frustrated. Blade was quite vocal in his frustration with Honoria, as well. That was a fantastic thing to read. I can't tell you how many times I've suffered with a mind-numbingly frustrating heroine's sundry issues only to curl my lip at the hero's seeming limitless patience for - or obliviousness to - those issues. Sometimes it's just nice to see a hero call her on it, be affected by it, acknowledge it as the head-cracker it is. Blade did that, and I loved it.<br /><br />That's not the only reason I loved Blade though. He was...it. The perfect \\"it.\\" Bad boy with a heart of gold, borderline monster with a soft spot for his woman, honorable crook, violent protector, the most loyal libertine. And he had this unguarded tenderness in him for Honor. Against even the warnings of his own people he wanted her and took care of her, fought with her and yearned for her, protected her and wanted to throttle her. He was jealous and adorable with it, fierce and sexy as hell with it, resolute and uncompromising and utterly trustworthy with it. He was, in short, perfect. Even his flaws were perfect.<br /><br />Together their chemistry was tempestuous, emotional, fraught with tension, and absolutely incendiary.<br /><br />Combine two awesome characters with a perfect complement of memorable secondary and ancillary characters, give them a layered, complex plot with several meaty, overlapping plot threads to keep them racing against time and evading danger, and you have this book. I was in reader heaven. I loved the story, the journey from the opening words to the final sentence. Villains and their villainy, hopelessness, loss, injury, lust, threat, risk, failures and triumphs littered the whole of the book in such a way that every chapter was an odyssey.<br /><br />Some story elements surprised the heck out of me, some I'd figured out fairly early, some made me nervous and some made my gut churn with dread, desperate for it all to work out. The overall plot did absolutely everything it was supposed to do. It entertained the hell out of me.<br /><br />Books like this are exactly why I'm so rabid about reading. I was transported into McMaster's world and held there until she deigned to let me go. Her writing is a stylized joy, her imagination a fierce weapon, her sense for story and character a tremendous gift. And I'm thrilled, just thrilled, that there is more to come in this series. I can't wait.<br /><br />Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Sourcebooks Casablanca publisher Sourcebooks via NetGalley.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free is a very addictive and fun game. I had a hard time putting it down as I kept saying \\"just one more level and I'll stop for now.\\" Never happened that way. I've nearly finished all the levels with the exception of a couple that I couldn't figure out. I love this game!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I Installed this on the computer, kindle fire, and two phones. I love the ability to make a shopping list and my husband will get it at the store.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. amazing. it works sooo well on my kindle fire :) I reccomend this app to everyone on this entire planet. :)
B000IYU9IG|4.0|A good John Wayne movie, more comedy than drama. And of course, it features Maureen O'Hara, a great duo. A definite 4 stars.
B0090EHVMC|2.0|I think we didn't finish this movie.  It just didn't capture our attention which is unfortunate because it is a good story.  I definitely like the 15 minute storybook better... sometimes stretching out a story doesn't work so well.
B00846REIS|5.0|So many reasons to love this book. First of all the thought of therapy used and appreciated is phenomenal! It is usually  not entered into so willingly so for that I applaud the author. I especially liked the way that Eva explained Dr Peterson and how his therapy and the set up was a \\"safe place\\". She goes on to explain how this huge place is used to treat and to hang out. That therapy is not over after the session, it is constant support. Without giving a spoiler, it was indeed a safe place for Eva.<br /><br />My next reason is the sub-characters. I did love Cary and their friendship. I really thought that Eva has just one person, Cary, to trust and confide. He had a similar issue to Eva's and they both together embraced therapy and healing. I was deeply in love with Cary until his messed up freaky party. I will forgive him eventually.<br /><br />The next is the complex families. We know Eva and her Mother are equally in need of therapy for the same sort of reasons. How she goes about trying to control her daughter is laughable. She has resources and when she does things like cell phone tracking she doesn't hide her stalker tendencies. So yeah I loved her too. Step Dad was aces in my book too. Mr Stanton was just Eva's only protector before Gideon. Eva never confided in her real father what she experienced, so I think she had a certain bond with her Step Dad. Eva's real dad is a cop so maybe with the available weapons, she should keep her secret!<br /><br />Before the big deal I will say I loved Scott, Gideon's assistant and Mark Eva's boss. Both of those characters added a light side to an otherwise dark story. There was a point when Scott tells Eva how he enjoyed seeing his boss smile and tells her he never saw him so happy. That was special to me. Mark was so happy to get Eva as an assistant and was not even a little reluctant to have a newbie assist him on his first big presentation. I liked how he showed a weakness right away by telling her that he would figure it out as they went along. Not too many bosses would admit they never had an assistant and show weakness the way he did. Mostly they would fake being a leader. He looked at her as though she was his equal. So big smooches Scott and Mark.<br /><br />Now the deep dark, handsome, amazing, intelligent, and captivating Gideon Cross. Where do I begin? Well he is all that! When he finally opens up to Eva and makes a few big mistakes he tells her right away that he will not let her go. Just straight out and right to the point, he let her know that SHE was his weakness. I hope I am not alone in my perception of that one. But I loved the way that he made no secret about his wanting to posses her. It had little to do with wanting to top her too. He never felt like that with anyone and he never let anyone into his home, life, and business before. This book did not get into the depths of Gideon s past, but I bet it will be shocking. Also, loved him a little more cause he didn't really hesitate and said he would go to see Dr. Peterson. Bravo Gideon you got extra credit. I hope I can show him how pleased I am (delusional me?? nah)<br /><br />The ending had me anticipating the next book. I think there are 3 scheduled for this series. Now I must add Gideon to my book boyfriend list and wait for the next book.e it out as they went along. Not too many bosses would admit they never had an assistant and show weakness the way he did.

B000I2J6K0|5.0|This is my third pregnancy and I have LOVED this video for my current and last pregnancy.  I have tried numerous videos that made me feel like I wasn't capable of lifting a finger.  This is a great, challenging video that is about 40 minutes long and by the end of my pregnancy and doing this I am wiped. I love it and would highly recommend to any avid exerciser.  I read that another reviewer said that you need a lot of things, but all you really need it a chair for dips. You can make due with the floor for everything else.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|Fun game! Very challenging. Wasn't too sure that it was going to be a keeper but it surprised me. Runs perfect on my Toshiba Thrive. I would definitely recommend this app.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|But that's a good thing.  I used it on a recent trip and the offline maps were quite nice considering I'm a luddite with no smartphone.  My only wish would be for the main highway route numbers to be visible without having to zoom in a ton.  Other than that how the heck can anyone complain about free offline maps?  How quickly people forget about gas station map prices when lost in the middle of nowhere.
B00008438V|5.0|Bought this dvd some time ago but forgot to rate it.  I love 80's movies & this is a classic.  Was able to purchase this very cheap.  Excellent product & outstanding seller.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love using pinterest.  It makes it easy to search for recipes, craft ideas, and anything else you could ever think of.  Seriously addicting.
B0087HT36U|5.0|i love it. lots of fun for myself and my kids. very challenging and rewarding. great game, great game play , and easy controls
B008PE9GSA|1.0|I have to being this review by telling you I have been a lifelong ZZ Top fan...one of my top three favorite bands of all time. LOVE LOVE LOVE their early work...LOVE Eliminator and Recycler. But since then, its been mostly downhill. I've faithfully bought every album up through this one, hoping things would get back on track. But it seems that is not to happen. Long gone are the snappy back-beat rhythms, catchy original guitar riffs, and such. All of that has been replaced with...well...mud. This album exemplifies it. My next door neighbor's teenage kid's garage band could play this stuff. There's not a memorable song on the entire album. No great guitar, no cool rhythm, nothing. Hey ZZ Top, you're better than this. I'm done buying your new \\"crap\\" based on your reputation for doing great stuff before. This album sucks, Honestly, if the package for this album wasn't so thin, I'd throw it out to save the space on my CD shelf for something more deserving.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|very enjoyable little (haha) game. nice way to kill some time. getting more challenging as I go,  and I am really enjoying the 3 challenges per level.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I almost didn't buy this movie because of some of the reviews, that would have been a pity, my whole family enjoyed the show, from grown kids to grandkids, Grandpa and I included.  The acting was good, the movie was good,  my whole family like the take on the story.  I didn't like Stewart in the first two twilight movies, my kids just thought that was the way she was playing the part, I thought she just couldn't act.  I think my kids were right, she did a good job in this movie.  People complaining about her acting are having flashbacks to the twilight shows!
0307949486|1.0|Okay, i'll admit right now that i couldn't get all the way through this book. It reads like its somewhere between a feminist propoganda puff piece produced by SCUM & a self defeatist white hetrosexual male shame decleration: Which is not suprising considering its author is from Sweden.<br /><br />It honestly appears like every single woman in this book is a victim of some sort of sexual assualt, an every single man is some sort of sexual predator. Heck the main character is apparently so charismatic (though frankly, i'm not seeing it), that every female character either wants to have sex with him, or falls madly in love with him... An those who don't do this, secretly have but are fighting off these feelings for some stupidly \\"feminist logic\\" reason.<br /><br />I mean Lisbeth Salander is revealed to have been raped, which we are all meant to agree is terrible... She then rapes the guy right on back & we are meant to some how be cheering for this character? This really was misandric tripe from start to finish, self defeatist white hetrosexual male shame decleration by an author with deep seated unresolved guilt issues over his own part in a rape on a teenage girl with the name of Lisbeth (hmmmmmm, i wonder who her animus in the novel is? Its very well disguised).<br /><br />As for technical quality, this book is appaling. About one third of it is exposition, with some of the sickest logic & most twisted justifications for actions i've ever seen in a novel.<br /><br />Yes there is a whole heap of hype aorund this novel... All the same avoid it like the plague.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have had this app for a day and I cant seem to put my kindle fire down lol!! I love it you will too just get it and try it If you don't like it uninstall it...
B008XG1X18|5.0|great site to save money by finding diy ways to craft.  also great to find inspiration for just about anything
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|best book on my kindle, highly recommend... great price! great material so worth it! i cant wait for more books like this, any suggestions please comment
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love going to the fair and playing coin games. its the best ever go out a get this game now.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is one of the most unique novels I have read in a long time. Since we know little about North Korea, it is fascinating to have a setting and perspective that brings to life what we fear and how a society can evolve in such a manner. To me it reminds me of a modern day George Orwell's 1984. The language is very descriptive and the tone the book sets is very realistic. The contrast of the reality of the situation , through the eyes of the main character ( an orphan who is really not an orphan ) is very believable . The visit to the US and the lies they all seem to tell each other and themselves is very well done. The picture painted of the totalitarian State if even 50% true would scare anyone in the western world that considers themselves to live under freedom. Could not put it down.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I normally wait till a book is not on the best seller list before downloading onto my [[ASIN:B004HZYA6E Kindle Keyboard 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6\\" E Ink Display - includes Special Offers & Sponsored Screensavers]]but this time I could not resist despite the fact that it was slightly above my usual $3.99.  It was definitely worth every penny.  It just proves the fact that you can just never tell from the outside what is happening in someones' marriage much less their minds. Very well written with lots of twists and turns. I will probably read more from this author.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Love this movie! The storyline moves, the action is awesome, but not too gory. Great date movie! Lead actors perfectly match book characters. Action well done!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was recommeded to me.  I couldn't put it down.  Thankfully their are more.... :-)  If you liked Fifty Shades of Grey (which I did) my guess is that you will LOVE this.  The passion and relentless behaviors are fascinating and captivating.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book started out a lot like 50 Shades but if you can get past that it's good. Excited about the next book.
B009ENIHPY|1.0|to even download this took a long time, it kept saying \\"unknown error' and wouldn't let me play it even though i had been charged and when it finally was able to play, it completely stopped playing right around ten seconds in. disappointed amazon.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this book in two days! I stayed up till 2am both days, I just couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the next!
B008FOB2B4|5.0|Being a fan of Vangelis for more than 30 years, I was hesitant about buying this album, thinking that he could not top the previous Chariot's soundtrack. In fact, I believe this is so much of an improvement over the first that I would only hope that Vangelis is the choice to score Blade Runner 2, so we have the chance to see his genius at work again.<br />I would put this album at the top of his long list of wonderful achievements.<br />Like many of his previous albums, it matters not if you have the opportunity to see the movie he scores or in this case the play. All you have to do is sit back and let Vangelis take you to another place.<br />My only disappointment is that we may have to wait years for another release from him. I've been very frustrated in recent years at his lack of concern about his many fans, choosing not to release any new material. His recent interviews seem to suggest that he is not particulary interested in recording any longer. I was frankly very surprised that this album was released at all.<br />I highly recommend this album to any current Vangelis fan, and to anyone looking to listen to some simply beautiful music.
B008XG1X18|5.0|logged in with facebook. no problems so far also great on kindle fire. highly recommend. I enjoy the ap daily
B0086700CM|4.0|Plays great on the kindle once u get use to rocking it side to side to move your man side to side. Very addictive game. Great time killer.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Bought for my three year old granddaughter and she loves it.  WAnts to watch it every day.<br />And she now \\"speaks for the trees\\".
B008F5YDRI|3.0|Not that it was bad... Mainly... Just too predictable. Gald we waited for the video release rather than seeing in a theater.
B003QTSMXE|4.0|I liked it - it was well made - a little hectic at times but overall enjoyable.  I would recommend it for young people or older people who like animation.  K in Cody
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is the best and most addicting site ever. I cannot wait to start doing the crafts with my son and making amazing healthy meals.
B0056CUZRA|3.0|Not as good as some of his other historical novels, particularly Pillars of the Earth but better than some of his romance nonsense. Some of the conversation language feels forced and therefore I found the book difficult to immerse in. However a decent read.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|In my opinion this is one of their best albums. Great music all around. My 2 year old loves to dance to it as well ;p Overall, all of the songs are easy to listen to and well written. Almost all of the songs on this album could be a hit on the radio.
B0088TG252|5.0|Exciting and action filled.  Is this our real espionage system?  Denzel terrific as usual.  Wonder if there is an alternate ending
0812992784|1.0|rushdie is one of the worst writers on the planet. his books are adored by the 'luvie' crowd of islington socialists and win awards. but nobody reads them. his sales figures are abysmal. here, he spares us any attempt to be creative and lounges in pompous self regard for 600 pages. the famous rushdie goes here, visits this celeb and that politician.<br />he airs his opinions of all things political and cultural, now that he is famous for being named in a fatwah. his friend martin amis seethes with jealousy, a writer equally untalented but denied the fame of daily newspaper stories about his safety.<br />rushdie's knowledge of international affairs was highlighted on the bbc recently. he was interviewed widely for his expertise on islamic affairs, at the time of attacks on americans following release of the anti-islamic movie. alas, nobody had ever explained to poor salman that there is a difference between an embassy and a consulate. and on the bbc he showed clearly that he thought they were the same thing. he actually referred to the 'embassy in benghazi'.<br />this book will be bought by the kind of people with inferiority complexes who think they have to have something on the coffee table to show that they went to college, at a state university
B0086700CM|4.0|there's no power ups in kindle edition. and the life recovers that you buy don't work . but very good game
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Excelent movie; just one thing, as I bought this from Canada, I couldn't get a Digital version because both sites are for US customers.....too bad.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest and when the app works, its great! unfortunately force closes a lot. This is still one of my favorite apps!
B008XG1X18|1.0|i just updated the app and it closes and shuts down. its useless now. it either wont open or forces closed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just when you think you may have one part figured out, everything shifts and you cannot tell what is truth, what is imagination and what is out-and-out lies! Makes you look at how well you THINK you know your mate... Narrated in alternating views of the husband and wife, you see both sides of a plot where the art of manipulation is taken to new heights. Very highly recommended: I loved it!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|using kindle fire with pinterest ...love it ...no issues so far.  able to view boards and repin as I wish. just wish folks did better with their keywords
0783228457|5.0|this movie was far ahead of it's time.  Some of the special effects  on are ehmmm, but hey this was the 80's , however this is a mind bending movie
B00002DE0S|5.0|As I've mentioned in other reviews, I'm not musically trained, so I will leave technical and theoretical quibbles to others and go with my gut and ears, and taking that direction I'm forced to say that this is a lovely set of recordings of Chopin's concertos. For me, piano and orchestra are melded together in these works far better on these discs than in any other I've heard. As another reviewer stated, the slow movements are the best of the lot, though the others are wonderful as well in their way. My only complaint with this release is on the marketing side -- why two discs, when presumably the performances could be squeezed onto only one? That aside, this is my choice for the Chopin concertos, period.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its fun to play well the only athare thing about it that. I don't really like about it is that when it falls to the side you don't. get scwot for it
0345803485|1.0|Seriously, crap like this is why there needs to be some sort of refund program for Kindle. You can have the thing back if only you will take it. A sexual Dominant gets to screw a virgin and he takes all of 15 minutes to finish her off? If you're going to write porn for women, at least do it well. It's awful, don't buy it. Period. (Disclaimer: I haven't read any porn in, well, since before Ana was born. I bought the book because so many people I know (live and in person!) were telling me they loved it. Now I know they are idiots, and possibly lousy in the sack, too. More things I wish I didn't know.)
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I really had not heard any good reviews about this movie but I love Russell Brand, Tom Cruise, Julianne Hough, and Catherine Zeta-Jones so I had to see it. From the very first shot of Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) emerging out of bed to the final song that included the entire cast I LOVED IT! I have been waiting for this movie to finally hit blu ray so I can watch it again. This movie is funny, quirky, shocking, and exciting. The best way I can describe is that it's like Grease but for the 80's kids! This is a feel good movie that reminds you of all the crazy hair and style that everyone use to wear. This movie is a must have in my collection!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Roy Dotrice is one of the best readers working today and has kept my interest through all of the novels that George R. R. Martin has put out telling the tale of A Song of Ice and Fire.  I'm on the fourth presently and was a bit upset at the prospect of there intention to release the fifth installment in 2015.  That is my only gripe with multiple installment novels.  I'm really into the Dexter series and it really doesn't matter if the author stopped writing them or not because he hasn't promised to release one, as has Mr. Martin.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love playing solitaire and it really helps the time pass. I understand why there are so many ads but it still is annoying. Besides that the app is perfect.
B007SGM084|3.0|so i don't really see what the big deal is about this book.  I know they are making a movie, I hope it's all three books rolled into one movie....that's how much actual story there is to it.  Just as it gets a real story conflict going it is quickly resolved and very easy to guess what's going to happen. Oviously the big deal is that it's basically got written porn thrown in.  Some of that was interesting but I just don't think it's so \\"wild\\".  Maybe I had enough sex as a grown up that the kinky stuff in this book doesn't have the same effect on me. whatever.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Very exciting reading. The book takes you on a journey full of fantasy and beautiful landscapes.Looking forward to the next chapters.
0345803507|3.0|i am not really fond of reading books and stuff and honestly this is the first book i have ever tried to read to see if i would like it. but i didn't, i tried reading the first 10 pages and i got bored and this book is now just sitting on my desk for weeks now.
B00881VLCE|5.0|fun.. and easy game..have a hard time putting it down!!!!recommend to every one to play you'll love it and have a hard time putting it you self...you'll pick it up and play every day...GARUNTEED!!!!!!!!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I like it. its got a really good concept. I recommend it. I think it is a good time waster too.
0385344228|5.0|What an original idea and an awesome story line with twists and turns.  I don't usually reread books; however, this book I would and especially if it were for a book club to have other avid readers to discuss it with.  We discussed it for a book club tonight with one lively discussion.  I intend to purchase a copy for my mom and dad who will also thoroughly enjoy this story.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I just wanna. play the game....reallyy!!_  can I just play the game ywithout aany reviews....wtf do u want me to say
B0082S3FA4|5.0|Sherlock Holmes and Watsons adventures are always very interesting and detailed. The mysteries will keep the pages turning and time passing for hours!
B0085776BG|3.0|I enjoyed Red Tails mainly because it told a good story about mainly ignored Black pilots in WWII.  As a former pilot, some of the in-flight activity was difficult to accept such as the excellent communications among pilots. However, it did make the film a lot more interesting.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think this is a really fun game and is perfect for people who have nothing to do. And it is a VERY GOOD time waster!
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|This CD is amazing. I love Paramore and I have all of their CD's. Bottom line, get the CD. You won't regret it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty Shades Freed was an exciting ending to a racy trilogy.  It tied up loose ends and left the storyline open for another chapter...
B0090P98Z4|3.0|this game is hug bear time. it will fly like toy cat in fan over cream pie. cant make soiled pants smell like herpes
B004SBQGHS|5.0|By now most people have played Angry Birds either on their own device or on a friends. If you haven't, the only thing you should be worried about when you buy it is how much time you are about to spend trying to knock down blocks and get revenge on those little piggies. It's a great game with easy to master game play but the later levels still present enough of a challenge to keep you interested long after you would have put a lesser game aside.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|does what it is supposed to. no hang ups or anything. I would recommend this app to other people that need a good free calculator.
B004HO6I2O|5.0|Saw this in a hotel and I feel sorry for the people trying to sleep in the room next to me because I know I kept them up. Get the kids out of the house for this one because there are \\"F\\" bombs every few seconds and there is nudity, but every nude part or \\"F\\" bomb made me laugh. The one way in which this movie stands out is that it finishes well and is funny all the way to the end. Most funny movies and especially every \\"switch\\" movie gets stupid by the half way mark, but this one kept up its momentum until the credits. Liked it so much that I am ordering the BR now. I wonder if I saw the uncensored version since it was German TV? Reynolds' best movie since Waiting (one of my favorites) and this is basically the same character.<br /><br />I'm assuming that the bad reviews are from people who only watch CSPAN or the Disney Channel, and either consider themselves too intellectual or too mature for a good laugh.
B005E94WB0|5.0|Plantronics Voyager Pro HD bluetooth headset looked a little fragile so searched for a carrying case and found this one. The carrying case is perfect, it's leather, it's lightweight, the price was great and it does everything I wanted it to do and takes up little space doing it. I am really satisfied. And shipping and delivery were as close to instant as could be, for standard shipping costs! [[ASIN:B005E94WB0 NEW Carrying Case for the Voyager Pro (Home Office Products)]]
B00846TRHY|5.0|Great Movie and a true story too boot. Heart wrenching for all those kids in Africa. Some parts of this movie brought me to tears and made me think of what we take for granted as a nation.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I was looking on the Kindle app store, when I saw what the top paid app was. And to my surprise, it was none other than Minecraft Pocket Edition. I was so flippin excited because I just so happen to have Minecraft on the PC. I was waiting for this to come out for the Kindle for ages. And finally Mojang put it out for us to play. It's amazing, but it takes 5 MB of memory, so unless you have that, make some space. Oh, and buy it on the computer because people said that if you buy it on the Kindle, you don't get it. So ya.... IT'S AMAZING
B0087HT36U|5.0|I really like this game a lot. It was fun and tested my mind. My 7year old loves it as well. It was exciting to save the pheasants.It takes good strategy techniques to do it.I highly recommend this game for young and old.
B005AKFXZW|1.0|To be honest I didn't finish reading this book, it just got a bit too dull and well pointless to warrant finishing it. I found the whole it's a game but you can't know what the game is, or the rules or who your playing against thing very tedious in the end. Really the author just left me hanging too long and I lost interest.
B00190KZUU|5.0|This movie was suggested to me by my aunt after my grandfather passed away. The stories in the movie and the characters felt like my life. Amazing movie!
B004EPZ03O|4.0|In this newly revamped Muppets movie, puppet Walter and his human brother Gary have grown up admiring the classic Muppets TV show. On a trip to LA with Gary and his long-time girlfriend Mary, Walter, who was so excited to see the Muppet Theater, finds it in disarray. What's worse, he overhears a conversation implying an oil tycoon will tear down the theater and drill for oil if the Muppets can't raise $10 million. Walter appeals to Kermit and together they bring the old gang back together. However, with only 48 hours left until showtime, and the feeling that America may have forgotten their one time beloved characters, Walter finds that he may be the Muppets' only hope. New musical numbers and interspersed with classic tunes, in this lovable, quirky, and downright cheesy movie!<br /><br />For me, the Muppets represent a timeless brand of humor and entertainment that has survived decades. This film reminds us of Jim Henson's legacy and his desire to bring laughter to audiences of all ages. While the cheesiness was sometimes a little over the top, I found myself smiling throughout the movie and remembering fondly the characters I grew up with. This is a great family feel-good movie!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|awsome<br />awsome<br />sweet fun<br />I love it soooooooo much you never want to stop playing fun fin fun fun cool cool
1401322786|4.0|In Mitch Albom's The Time Keeper, we witness the lives of three people: Dor, the first measurer of time and later Father Time; Sarah, a teenage girl who falls in love for the first time; and Victor, an elderly businessman dying of cancer. Dor, punished for counting moments instead of living them, is banished to a cave for thousands of years, where he listens to people pray for more time. He is then sent back to Earth to help Sarah and Victor understand the repercussions of obsessing over time.<br /><br />This is a very quick read, and reminded me of Albom's The Five People You Meet in Heaven. Once again, he brings together characters from different walks of life and teaches a lesson about the value of life and love. I sometimes found Victor and Sarah to be a little cliche in their description, but overall, I liked how the story was told. It switched between characters, giving us short glimpses and images of their lives. In the end, the three main characters' lives become interwoven and they each learn something from the others. I highly recommend this novel to readers of all ages!
0812993292|5.0|Little did I know when I started this book how much I was going to enjoy it.  Who couldn't help but fall in love with Harold Fry?  He starts his journey with such a simple intent, not yet knowing what this path would help him discover.  The author tells a fine tale of the people he meets along the way, his wife Maureen back at home, and finally at the end of the road, Queenie.  I laughed, I cried, I cheered for both Harold and Maureen.<br /><br />This book certainly stands out as one of the best I have read this year and a new all time favorite.  I love the message of hope, redemption, dreams and perseverance.  This is our first novel from Ms. Joyce and all I can says is Wow!  I am looking forward to more from this very talented author.
B0083H6AQA|4.0|Robert Pattinson's finest performance.  I enjoyed it a lot and the cast did a great job. All I can say is , he can really act and his role is definitely one of his best .
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|...but it was quite entertaining, solid plot, and well acted.  I hadn't read the book(s), so I was completely in the dark.  No problem, the screenplay was well written and the plot flowed seamlessly.
0385344228|5.0|Landay uses the unreliable narrator to great effect here as you are kept guessing to the last page just what exactly is the main character's reason for relating this story. I was reminded of Presumed Innocent, in a good way. Read it.
0345536886|3.0|The plot was well planned and the action moved quickly but the story was predictable and, as another reviewer said, got boring shortly after David joined the F&F law firm.  I liked the characters, especially David, and am happy that he stopped trying to save the sinking ship that was the F&F law firm.  I was a paralegal before my retirement and worked in the major law firms that defended big corporations then, later, in house in a corporation itself.  There is a great deal of truth and accuracy in Grisham's portrayal of the large law firm, the defense attorneys, the corporation and the Federal Court system.  I remember those Rocket Dockets!!<br /><br />John Grisham is a very good writer and this is a fun read with interesting characters but just not the best book Grisham has written.
B000002LAC|5.0|I have wanted this cd for years & finally got it.  I love it & listen in the car all the time.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This movie was absolutly delectable. the case wasn't scratched up. the movie was everthing i expected and more. I would recommend it to everyone in the WHOLE world as long as they liked the movie.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|a good read as all Kathy Reichs books have been.  i do not remember seeing this on the tv show. knowing her work and the quality made this a easy sell.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I like it! it is angry birds gone pirate..awesome new gadgets to catapult off or pull down. I recommend it if you like angry birds
B005SCSL56|4.0|I must say that the book was very interesting.  I only read it because of Chris Colver being on the television show Glee.  It was a book, I think, that children and young adults would enjoy.  I didn't care too much for the ending and I also don't think he gave enough information about what happened after they returned to reality, or came out of the book.  Since the sister discovered that she is part fairy what does that make the brother?  Like I said a very interesting book but incomplete.
0143119680|5.0|First, this book is long, and so is the second one in this trilogy, there are lots of possibly \\"unnecessary details\\" but all enjoyable to painting the picture and for making the book feel more realistic and true to the time.<br />I truly enjoyed every second of this book not wanting it to end but rushing to read it just to find out what happens next. The book has lots of historical and scientific references, most seem to be fairly accurate, which was a fun mix with the fantasy of witches and vampires.
B005LAIHCM|1.0|\\"House at the End of the Street\\" suffers from the same lame attempts at scaring you that \\"Insidious.\\" While the music cues aren't there, there's more than its fair share of loud noises to try and make you jump. Jump scares are really just awful, especially since you can see most of them coming a mile away. People don't seem to realize that that isn't horror. Being startled and being scared are two entirely different things.<br /><br />Once you get past that, the horror-thriller is very generic with the urban myth like storytelling becoming a reality and the main character doing something she knows she shouldn't and it coming back to bite her in the ass by the time the climax rolls around. The storyline is very clich&eacute; and one you've seen done dozens of times before.<br /><br />Even the way the movie is edited drips with douchebaggery as every shot starts off blurry and slowly transitions into a more focused shot. It even has this annoying shaking effect every once in awhile with irritating sound effects to try and creep you out. Things like flashlights not working when they need to or not being able to find the keys to the car when someone is being chased is thrown in to really make the predictable factor really sink in.<br /><br />There are a few worthwhile segments in the movie; the main one being the dinner scene with Elissa, Sarah, and Ryan. It's funny, dramatic, and pretty intense. It's easily the best scene in the movie. The twist is kind of interesting, too; interesting in a way that kind of ruins the Ryan character of the movie. There is also one of the quickest death scenes in history. Somebody dies like immediately after they're stabbed. It's just really peculiar.<br /><br />\\"House at the End of the Street\\" is just an excuse to cash in on Jennifer Lawrence's recent success and to look down her shirt for an hour and forty minutes. If you must see it, wait to rent it as it really isn't worth the price of today's movie ticket prices. It's as if it's a combination of \\"House of Wax\\" and \\"The Last House on the Left\\" in title and in story, but its content isn't nearly as graphic. The remake of \\"The Stepfather\\" also comes to mind. Everything is so predictable that it doesn't really offer anything remotely worthwhile. This is the type of run of the mill, cookie cutter, PG-13, piss poor excuse of a horror movie that horror fans always complain about over the internet.tion of \\"House of Wax\\" and \\"The Last House on the Left\\" in title and in story, but its content isn't nearly as graphic.

B006HTUZ1C|3.0|I like the concept of this game, but I found myself getting bored after a few turns. Ended up deleting the game the same day I downloaded it.
B008OTTRXU|3.0|\\"Call Me Maybe\\" is the highlight of Canadian Idol contestant Carly Rae Jepsen's U.S. debut [[ASIN:B008OTTRXU Kiss]]. While successive singles \\"Good Time\\" featuring Owl City and \\"This Kiss\\" are solid, they are less impressive than the aforementioned juggernaut. Overall, Kiss is an average affair that suits is purpose as an album of `records' but nothing more. Some cuts are more distinct or notable than others, but most use the same blueprint, which underwrites Kiss as an entire entity.<br /><br />\\"Tiny Little Bows,\\" produced by Dallas Austin and Cory Enemy, yields a solid neo-disco sound. Catchy, the chorus highlights as Jepsen sings \\"How do you think it goes/with those tiny little bows/you're the one I want/you're the one I know/and everywhere you are/is a place I wanna go...\\" \\"This Kiss,\\" produced by Redfoo (of LFMAO) and Matthew Koma, is slightly more distinct despite similarities to the opener.  Sound proves more important than Jepsen's voice ultimately, with the chorus again being a highlight.<br /><br />\\"This Kiss\\" certainly does not outperform \\"Call Me Maybe,\\" which eclipses everything. Josh Ramsay produces/co-writes the `big-time hit' every artists wishes they could land. The refrain is easily memorable: \\"Hey  just met you/and this is crazy/but here's my number/so call me maybe/it's hard to look right/at you baby/but here's my number/so call me maybe...\\" Locked into the neo-disco sound and  confirmed by those lovely signature disco string swirls, \\"Call Me Maybe\\" is `larger than life'<br /><br />\\"Curiosity\\" isn't incredibly distinct, particularly since it follows up the `queen' of the effort.  The biggest flaw is an odd key change which isn't smooth in the least.  While it is meant to intensify, it just comes off as clunky.  \\"Good Time,\\" featuring Owl City atones, yielding one of the highlights of the effort. The production is solid, notable for its  synths and rhythmic components. \\"Good Time\\" is incredibly `schmaltzy' to the chagrin of more edgy-pop enthusiast, but to its credit, the songwriting structure itself is sound. The chorus is by no means intelligible, but then many aren't these days right? \\"Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh/who-oh-oh/it's always a good time...\\" Definitely not Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen songwriting.<br /><br />\\"More Than  A Memory\\" seems to recycle ideas more than revolutionize. Jepsen's lower register rears its head on the verses, though her upper register, `teenage-like' vocals are more desirable. \\"Turn Me Up\\" atones, even if it just `tweaks' the formula that predominates the album.  Hand it to Jepsen to deliver a catchy chorus: \\"I'm breakin' up with you/you're breakin' up on me/You kiss me on the phone/And I don't think it reaches/What am I to do/And how's it gonna because breakin' us in two/is breakin' me in pieces/breakin' up with you...\\" Every Jepsen song referencing `calling' seems to be effective.<br /><br />\\"Hurt So Good\\" has its catchy moments, but is ultimately not memorable.  \\"Beautiful,\\" co-written by Toby Gad and Justin Bieber provides a welcome change of pace that features accompanying acoustic guitar. The results still underwhelm somewhat, even when both vocalists combine forces.  \\"Beautiful\\" comes off `too light' with not enough `punch.'<br />\\"Tonight I'm Getting Over You\\" punches, with Max Martin producing; the songwriting credits are lofty here.  Josh Ramsey produces \\"Guitar String/Wedding Ring\\", with less notable results than his brilliant \\"Call Me Maybe.\\" \\"Your Heart Is a Muscle\\" nearly works, but still lacks that extra `oomph.' Toby Gad's second production falls short like her first one (the Bieber/Jepsen duet \\"Beautiful). But listeners who are science enthusiasts will be glad to learn `your heart is a muscle.'<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B008OTTRXU Kiss]] yields some potential radio hits, but as a album, it is nothing more than average. The main issue lies in the fact that the same formula is used for almost every cut, which makes all the cuts seem less distinct than they should be.3 stars.3 stars.
B0092MKTL2|4.0|Imagine Dragons has done a wonderful job at being relevant to all generations but staying true their self. Keep up the good work.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is very easy to install and to use.  I like the way it displays all the numbers so you can see the whole problem.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This is a great film and a very rich adaptation of the first part of The Dark Knight Returns, a 4 part futuristic Batman story that debuted in the comics in 1986. The comic is a masterpiece and you can tell that the filmmakers realize this. This film takes the comic and stretches it a bit further into what you'd expect to come out of Warner Bros animated Batman film. It really is an even more comprehensive story, if that is even possible. The comic is 4 issues of absolute greatness. The thing to note is that this film is only the first part of the story, which is really the first two issues of the comic. At 1 hour and 30 minutes you can tell the whole story will be an operatic masterpiece when the 2nd part is released. The voice casting is phenomenal. Peter \\"Robocop\\" Weller is great as an aged, bitter and psychotic Batman. I'd say it's one of the best DC Comics animated films. Buy this if you are a DC fan, Batman fan, comics fan or superhero fan.
B008B0QH5S|5.0|If you are a PSB fan ignore the three or four negative reviews here.  This album sounds like it came right after Actually and Behaviour.  I loved Yes, and still do, but this album is nothing but 100% PSB.  It's beautiful, it's slower, it's actually 'introspective' (hehe see what I did there!).  it could have been released in 1991, that's how cool it sounds, Give it a Go!
B005HJWWW8|1.0|Sent it back. Anything that has the directions on a sheet of paper smaller than the device will never make it. Not to thrilled with return costs either. Lessons learned.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I appreciated being able to read this cultural phenom for myself; but aside from a few (and only a few) semi-hot sex scenes, I was low- and high-level creeped-out by the story.<br />Perhaps if the characters were better-written and developed I would have been merely \\"carried away\\" like so many other readers?<br />Instead, I am not interested in continuing to read on in this series.<br />At least with the other best-sellers marketed to women (Twilight and Hunger Games) I was at least curious to know \\"what happens\\" to the characters.<br />I am horrified that tween girls are reading the 50 Shades books - another indication that women are not fully empowered in this culture.

B008602KQI|4.0|Very entertaining.  Some questions go unanswered but over all this movie will keep your interest. Worth owing, I have waited it several times.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Mark Owen gave a very believeable account of his time in the Seals.  The majority of the book gives a picture of what it was to serve as a Seal.  I am not and authority on this, but hopefully someone more knowledgeable can verify Owen's veracity.<br />It might not be exactly what you want to hear about the events, but I think he gave a true account of what he saw that day when Osama finally paid for his actions.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I loved this game on iOs and I'm loving it on my Android now that I got it from the Amazon Appstore. For those of who never played this game, it's a no-brainer. You have to play this game. It's extremely addictive - although repetitive. The art style is awesome and the game is totally worth it (I think it's free). You cannot go wrong with any game made by Halfbrick Studios.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I was just wandering through the selection of e-books on loan for my library and saw how popular this book was and decided to loan it. I am ridiculously glad I did so. The pictures are amazing, the story intense, and the author brilliant. The handwritten letters were a little difficult to read on my kindle fire, but that's not a big deal to me since I wasn't expecting them to begin with.
0062071017|5.0|The Strategist is an exceptional business book - no matter where you are in your development as a business leader, there is room to improve and this book will help get you there. From the case studies of Jobs at Apple to the resurgence of Gucci, the author lays out a clear set of examples of what success looks like and then articulates a very clear roadmap to execute in getting there.<br /><br />She also makes it entirely transparent that strategy is a learned skill. Executives from around the world took her exec eduction class at Harvard and even though most were great operators, it is quite evident that there was room for improvement on leading. Great leaders are defined by their ability to develop and own strategy. Strategy is the genesis of opportunity and the foundation for execution; this book brings this reality to light and illuminates a path for each of us to take to a higher plane.<br /><br />Well done and thank you. This is the best business book I've read to date.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest had been on my top five site list for a long while. So when I saw the app I didn't think twice. Sadly the app crashes a lot... which deducted a star. It is a great place to find ideas and keep track of all those things I want to do as soon as I have time.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I started reading the books before I watched the first season.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how well they adapted the story and cast the show. Really enjoyable series.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is one of the unique series that all the stories are equal.  None of them disappoint and continue the story line to develop the characters and leads to one big finale!
B0000AK7AA|5.0|Great family movie! The 90's & 80's was my awesome dude. This movie has originality, it brings back lots of great memories.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|The Bourne Identity is nothing like the movie.  It is a page turning book that develops the characters and is very detailed!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the book! The \\"girl\\" is certifiably nuts!! Hoping that book two is coming soon! I did not want the story to end.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the first two books, but this one was just OK.  The one good thing is it did wrap up the story and put an ending to it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|sometimes ya just need to waste a bit of time...well this will help! it wont keep you busy for hours because you only have so many coins. that's what makes it a perfect time waster!
0439023521|5.0|This book is such a quick read.  When you read the synopsis it does sound gruesome, but the book is anything but.  It brings out the humanity in an inhumane new world.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is one of those I could not put down and was compelled to read in one sitting. Still don't see what all the Pentagon rub is all about. Good read and a must on any military history buffs list.
0439023491|5.0|This was a great sequel to the first book.  At times predictable, but at others it was suspenseful and kept you turning the pages.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is great for kindle.  sometimes it has. trouble loading but just force close and try again and it works great!
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book will suck you in to this story world and keep you flipping the pages.  It's a story that you can actually picture I. The real world.  Awesome read!
B003FHMHPQ|4.0|Great book. Really enjoyed the reading and information.. would recommended for anyone interred in angels and finding out what kind u might be.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This series is fantastic and the story continues!  The girl who kicked the hornets nest is a second book that will not disappoint.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Chris Nolan has come a long way since his first film and has consistently delivered complex plots narrated in a very easy and simplistic way. The Dark Knight series is just a shining example of his brilliance as a filmmaker. I would argue that this film is his masterpiece, his best piece of work yet. The final episode in the series was more on a grand scale, but this film is all about characters. Hats off to the late Heath Ledger for delivering one of the finest performances in Hollywood. I do hope that they decide to revive the series some day, though the Dark Knight series seems to have reached its logical conclusion with the final set.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great. It tells you exactly how much power your device has left, and it even says how long you have if you are reading, listening to music, etc. My favorite part is the graph that says how you've used you battery over time. I would highly recommend this app
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I'm not much for games but this one hooked me!  Easy to learn and takes just enough thinking to be fun yet not taxing.
B007RI56NY|4.0|This is right up there with all of Train's music.  Train's music always makes me smile.  The CD is always on my car's player, and available where ever I may go.
B005LAIGOQ|2.0|I went to see this one with my wife's family thinking that it actually looked like a decent horror movie, I was terribly disappointed. They completely failed to develop or deliver any plot which is made all the worse by the fact that the book is actually decent. If they had stuck to that plot this could have been a good movie.<br />*Spoiler*<br />The entire movie is, he goes upstairs to see what that noise was, then back downstairs to continue reading papers. This repeats for an hour and a half. The end.

B0000009NQ|4.0|A record that goes back much European discourse that began with \\"LOW \\". Start an activity as a painter, and often painted scenes that he sees in the neighborhood of turkish Neukoln, the same neighborhood that inspired the song \\"Heroes. \\" So the new world tour with an avant-garde big band, very difficult to recreate the atmosphere of the last two albums, Brian Eno's advisable to<br />contact Roger Powell, Todd Rundgren's Utopia keyboardist, sound engineer and musician magical, less cold than Brian Eno.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|like it. lots of fun for kids and adults too. watch the app store for costly downloads. overall good free game
B00008BLAS|5.0|The Grand Funk are really a great phenomenon in the 70s. The concerts were all sold out, and their records jumped the early positions of the charts. Shinin'on is a great album for me more than We're an american band ,always produced by Todd Rundgren. The writing it's better, songs more complicated, although in terms of sound quality is sometimes rough.But what other band had crafted a disc in 3D<br />at the time? The Grand Funk remain a myth.
0307960471|5.0|This is my third Jo Nesbo encounter. Suffice to say all of them are worth the time. For me, the Leopard was gut-tingling perfect; the second, Headhunters, was an exhilarating head shot; and Phantom, is full-frontal Knockout!<br />Every reader has his or her own perspective. In my case, I've become critical of a merchantile style of writing/publishing. A phantom that is a kind of invisible puppeteer. I, thus, imagine what's left on the publisher's cutting-room floor, or about Francis Bacon's arrow that flies in the night, because no one sees its deadly effect. That Phantom doesn't touch Harry Hole in anyway shape or form. Harry remains true to his character; in fact, he may even be prisoner to it.  There is a clubfooted character that Harry relates to, as having an operating fault. Harry realizes his own kind of clubfoot. To me, this clubfoot of Harry's is an operating fault that all the raw detectives have; a Philip Marlow curse to stand-up against society's endemic corruption. A suicidal archangel type.<br />Nesbo injects the-real-deal into his writing/The most tortured or destitute junkies would save the cotton guaze they used to cleanse the impurities from the dope as they drew it into the syringe. Then, on rainy-days, the guaze could be boiled and the brew injected. And, in aside, Nesbo adds/Plus a condom filled with semen and heroin.<br />So, Nesbo pulls no punches in his writing. Also, he can then turn on a dime move into the scientific/Stronger than heroine, longer effect, and little chance of OD'ing. Sounds like a junkie's dream. It's modified ...it does appear that one of the chlorine molecules has been exchanged for a florine molecule. It may not be that expensive to produce.<br />In this novel Harry Hole gets personal. This is what makes Phantom such a stand-out. Many who read Harry Hole need no reviews. For those who haven't read him, perhaps they should review and than read some other Holes before venturing here. Because, then the effect of this very personal Hole novel, will assuredly pack the Noble-quality knockout vivdly aspired to.<br />The title Phantom is mentioned several times in the novel. But the one I believe nails it is/Prision's worse than death. Death is simple; it liberates the soul. But prison eats away at your soul until there is nothing human left of you. Until you become a phantom.<br /><br />Waiting anxiously ringside, for Jo Nesbo's next bout!
B008XG1X18|4.0|love this app only problem I found was the slow loading on some pictures....so glad they finally made this app! I love pinterest!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|The author did an excellent job of providing personal insight into what is required of a Navy Seal. His behind the scene details of some of their overseas operations and especially his first hand account (as opposed to the second hand news accounts) of the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden was well chronicled. The book kept me engaged from the beginning to the end. If you want to read  a personal unfiltered account of how this raid went down by someone who was there, then this book should be on your list.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|my daughter loves it. simple and entertaining. would highly recommend if you need something to help you pass the time.
0736092269|5.0|I've read dozens of weightlifting books and magazines and have found useful bits of information here and there, but nothing I've found is as essential as this book.  The amazingly well-drawn pictures provide clear insight into exactly what muscles are being worked by each exercise, and how to do each exercise properly.  I also appreciated the tips on preventing injuries and how to compensate for injuries you may already have.  While the book does not cover specific training programs, everyone and their brother seems to have a different perspective on that anyway.  This book presents the facts on the effects of each exercise, allowing you to create a program to meet your own specific needs and goals.  There isn't any earth-shattering new information here, but it is presented in such a clear format that it shames similar information in other top-rated books.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I started the  first book, this is not the sort of book I usually like, but it grabbed me & I could not put it down. Then I could not wait for book 2& book 3. Great reading
B008QE9VJI|1.0|When I saw the previews for this I thought it was going to amazingly good, as all of Burton's films are. Yes, I expected the film to be quirky and dark, as they usually are...but this movie was so boring I was actually waiting for it to end. I don't care what anyone says; I grew up watching the Burton movies but this was not one I'll ever be watching again. Not to mention that the plot was everywhere! Also, took my little brother to see this, he's twelve, and there was far too much sexuality in this film for children. If you must watch this with your kids, prepare for some awkward moments.
B0050VI5SI|5.0|I'm probably the only one who thinks this, but Foster the People reminds me of The Cars a little bit. They have a lot of cool electronic sounds to go with the excellent melodies and vocals. Pumped Up Kicks is probably the most well known song, but this album has a ton of really good songs on it. The songs really have a good groove to them. Torches a great album to listen to from start to finish.
B005K01VZS|5.0|This is one of those books that you will think about for a long time. The characters become friends, people you wish you could have met.<br /><br />It's a great reminder that people that we do know, may be just like the ones he writes about, if we would take the time to really get to know them.<br /><br />I loved, loved, loved, this book!
0857685627|5.0|this book is so worth every penny. the art work is breath taking and if you love halo there is tons of stuff in here, about how they built the worlds.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|sweet game I cant stop playing this game. makes me feel like a kid as the small town carnival. I will share with friends.
B002VXGW2E|5.0|One of my favorite food movies - with two of my favorite actors: Meryl Streep and Amy Adams. Well-written, funny, poignant. One of the best films about what makes a good marriage.

1401233066|4.0|This is the 16th book in the Fables series.  It was a decent installment in this series.  The story surrounding Mister Dark comes to a climax and we learn a little more about Bufkin in the Office.<br /><br />In this issue Ozma creates a Super Team to take on Mister Dark, but the North Wind gets to him first.  The book also includes a little story about Bufkin the Monkey and a story about Sleeping Beauty.<br /><br />Bufkin is returned to his homeland in this story and another storyline is started with Sleeping Beauty, but the main point of this installment is to take care of the Mister Dark storyline.<br /><br />Ozma and Pinocchio decide to put together a Super Team to go and fight Mister Dark.  They hold auditions and make silly looking skin-tight costumes for the group.  All in all it is a little silly but also a bit ironic...you know...having fables in super hero suits.<br /><br />Ozma and Pinnochio's plot is set astray when the North Wind gets ideas of his own.<br /><br />The illustrations are in keeping with previous issues and I enjoyed them, they fit the tone of the story well.  It was also nice to have the whole Mister Dark storyline finally tied up.<br /><br />Overall a decent addition to the series.  I enjoyed the way the Mister Dark story was tied up, but thought the whole Fables as super heroes thing was a bit goofy.  I am intrigued to see where the Sleeping Beauty bit ends up going.  Highly recommended to fans of fairy tale retellings and urban fantasy.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Simple, but very enjoyable. Addicting fun, just like in the arcade, but without the lose of all your quarters :) A great time waster!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game!!!! I am so happy they have it for the kindle fire.. but I hate when the coins go over the side. that is the only thing I don't like. but otherwise I love it
B007Z9QWVK|5.0|I loved the movie! I didn´t know Madona was such a good director! I always wanted to know about Walis Simpson. I read books about her but wanted to see the movie too. I really recommend this movie!

B0087JTAKW|5.0|Wow! Mitch never fails to deliver a page-turner. The Time Keeper was a quick and delicious read which I devoured, savoring every bite of every tasty page. The depth he puts into his three main characters is incredible: I felt like I knew each of them personally and felt their pain and emotions. I can't wait to see what his next book is about: if it's half as good as The Time Keeper I know I will love it. Thanks, Mitch, for serving up another scrumptious story!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I don't notmaly leave reviews but this game was well worth the money. one of the best I have played on the kindle so far. can't wait till part two.

B00992CF6W|4.0|all it needs now is<br /><br />water<br />lava<br />minecarts<br />animal spawn eggs<br />night and day on creative<br />wolves<br />ocelots<br /><br />thank u add those and I will do 5 stars
B005D9MUWY|4.0|So far I like this ap.  It does a good job at predicting my next word even before I type a letter
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Got this for one of my daughters and she does like it. However, my other daughter then bought the eleventh model and one advantage of that is it makes a lot louder noise. The noise of the tenth is very low. The tenth has the writing aspect but that tends not to be used after being impressed when trying for the first time. I am thinking of getting a real one:  [...]  Shipping for both was amazing. The eleventh came from the UK, which added to the excitement. Ditto for the Dr Who lunch box.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I wish the iphone app would work as well as this does!!! the only thing I wish that this app had was a scroll to the top button.
B00992CF6W|3.0|when I first downloaded the game it worked fine I had made 3 worlds and made houses and was doing good. I woke up this morning started to get on the game and all my houses and chest and crafting tables was gone, and I tired to make a new world and when I closed it out the new world wasn't there. This game is great, but it doesn't work as it needs to work. The game is ok but it needs to be upgraded or at least fixed.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The Alchemist is a must read book for all those who ponder life and their journey. This is written in a beautiful and simple manner, one that I found most appealing. Imagery was skillfully used and his detail- not too much, but just enough to bring the reader into the protaganist's life. This book touched my soul and encouraged me to reflect, think and consider.
B001974DG0|5.0|Great read and wonderful story. I highly reccomend. I bought the book just because I like Koontz and love Golden Retrievers (which was on the cover). I was super happy when it turned out to be my favorite book by Koontz so far. I like how he draws you in with different characters and there lives by chapter. It's even better when those lives connect to each other. I always find that I want to focus on one or two people and there lives. Then when they connect I get super excited. This book was no different and I loved it. Plus what can be better then a thrilling story revolving around a dog : )
B004AQR24W|5.0|I had not paid very much attention to this movie on the theatrical release but  I missed it,  I would think it to be a continuation of the Rambo series.  I enjoyed and recommend it to all Stallone fans, especially those who like the Rambo and Rocky films.
B0006J28KU|5.0|This movie is the epitome of a darkness. It exploits the truth about a city, her men and women and it's tragedy. My favorite movie all time, I wish I hadn't seen it so I can have that first experience again. Great Work Mr. Mann!
B002H5JHUA|4.0|I liked this movie! I thought it was fun to watch. The action and acting were very well done. The characters of Van Helsing and Anna were well matched and enjoyable to watch. The depiction of the creatures (including Dracula) were some of the best that I have seen. Hugh Jackman's (Van Helsing) acting was excellent, especially when he said \\"Ladies first\\" to Kate Beckinsale (Anna). His chagrin when she did not respond was very funny.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|Good game that challenges your ability to think fast and is fun to play.  There are some good cubes to clear rows and columns and all cubes of a certain number.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Nothing here that would endanger any past or present person in the military (contrary to published reports). Not entirely flattering to the politicians in Washington, but that's too bad for them. All praise and honor goes to the author's team mates, he takes no credit for anything he does, a truly humble man (in contrast to his Commander In Chief). The author decided to set the record straight - in my opinion - he does so more than adequately. I hope he enjoys his retirement, he's earned it.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|I enjoy a good fantasy and am sick of the quest scenarios.  The Hunger Games is aimed at young adult readers but as a not at all young adult - I very much enjoyed it.  Good main characters - a few fringe ones seemed less so well defined especially in so far as motives etc. Having said that- as the story is told from the viewpoint of the main character Katniss, I guess that accords with her own limited knowledge of them. The plot line is terrific as well as the twists and turns.  Could not put it down and read all 3 volumes within few days.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|A good read.Michael Connelly managed to hold the suspense to the very end.<br />I would rec-amend this author for those of you who like a good detective story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Was a good book. Easy read. Great for teens. Read it in one to two days. Books r better than the movies anyway.
089898890X|5.0|As a professional drum teacher, I've been using this book for 10 years. If you're a drummer and have been thinking about learning about and how to play Jazz, then this is the book for you. This book has become a college requirement, it is a text that every drum teacher I know uses. If Jim Chapin's book \\"Advanced techniques for the modern drummer\\" was the most important book on jazz drumming of the past, John's is the present and future of Jazz drumming. If you don't have a drum teacher, this is the book that your teacher would reccomend. The text and history alone is valuable. If you're gonna play Jazz than this is one of the books that you can't live without
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|First and second books were the best. Took a little longer to read this one. Was alright though. Wish the ending was different.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I stayed up until 3:30 in the morning to finish \\"Gone Girl\\", and I absolutely hated it from beginning to end. I kept reading it hoping it was going to get better because it's on the current NY Times Best Seller list. It didn't. I disliked every single character. I thought it was contrived and trite and made a mockery of the reader. Every character in the book was a cliche'.  As for the ending ... what ending?  It's like the book stopped in the middle of a sentence and left me feeling that the author was laughing all the way to the bank at every single person who read it to the end.
B005K17RU0|5.0|fast and accurate.  easy to read. but it is the accuracy I appreciate.  I recommend this site to everyone. thanks
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|this was awesome when i first got it and couldnt see why it was rated 2.0 then after getting 1st on the begginer and expert on level1 i got confused that i couldnt move on. i looked back at the reveiws and i see now its only  a demo  i am not spending money on this game.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Yahoo Mail for Kindle Fire is absolutely great! It makes it so much easier to check mail on the go!
0345803485|4.0|I didn't really know what to expect with this book. The only thing I knew was that it was the first in a trilogy. I have a rule where I buy only the first book to read, and if I like the first book then I will continue to read the rest of the book series.<br /><br />I had heard good things about this book, and a few bad things about it. I wanted to read it for myself and see what I thought of it. I also heard that it has some scenes within the book, but oh my some of those sex scenes I admit made me blush.<br /><br />With that being said, some of the things that I really liked were: I really liked that the author went into detail for those scenes, rather than chickening out and just not writing the scenes or writing them with no description. I really like that she gave up the nitty gritty details. I liked that she gave the male main character, Christian Grey, a dark and broody past.  I also liked how the author gave the female character, Anastasia Steele, an innocent virgin good girl personality. Though some of the sex scenes made me blush, I liked them throughout the book.<br /><br />Some of the things that I didn't like were: the setting. I thought it was too close to the setting of the Twilight series. Though rumor has it that this was originally a Twilight Fan fiction, but I'm not sure if that's true or not, but it made me think of Twilight a little bit. I eventually got over that and was sucked into the book. Overall, I really enjoyed the book.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|This is one of the best books ever. I have read it at least 10 times and I sob at the end EVERY time.  Steinbeck describes the Salinas Valley perfectly (I grew up near there so I know). You will be drawn into the story and the times. If you read only one John Steinbeck book, and I hope you will read more, this would be the one.
0062206044|5.0|When I was given this book, I had no idea what it was about. I had never even heard of it. But I opened it up and started reading. As I was introduced to the children of the story, and I just felt instantly sad for them. Here we have three children, that lost their parents to a house fire, and they now have to live with some distance relative that they either haven't seen or never met before. Then the relative tries to marry Violet so he could get their fortune. That is like insult to injury.<br /><br />What I liked - I really like how the author sets up book one with a beginning that shows exactly how bad things might get with these children throughout the next books. I also really liked that the children were able to outsmart the Count even though he got away from the police and everyone in the end. Though I found it a little predictable in the end, I was surprised to see that she outsmart Count Olaf and his theater friends in the end. I look forward to reading the other books in the series.<br /><br />What I didn't like - I didn't really like that the author would have sections of the story filled with  sentences like \\"the word here means (insert definition here)\\" but I understand this is a Middle Grade book and some of those words might be above the children's vocabulary level. It just kind of took me out of the story that's all. I eventually got used to it popping up in the story but in the very beginning it was pulling me out from the story.<br /><br />Overall - I enjoyed this story more than I thought I would. It has captured my curiosity and I look forward to reading the other books in the series. I would recommend these books to my friends (and their children who are at this reading level).
B007Q4Y9HS|4.0|In 1971 `Tarkus' followed ELP's December 1970 debut album, and remains one of the trio's two or three definitive musical creations (some hard-core fans rate their 1973 epic `Brain Salad Surgery' as their crowning glory, and some prefer their re-working of Modest Mussorgsky's classic `Pictures at an Exhibition').<br /><br />`Tarkus' is a tight 20-minute piece of several movements, each flowing into the next. It's full of energy, musical virtuosity and innovation, mostly instrumental with a few melodic vocal passages, musing on the futility of war and conflict - surely a more relevant theme now in the 21st century than in 1971. You can hear the influence of jazz fusion in the improvisational sections, and of classical symphonic structure in the way the whole is put together: introducing the main theme, re-stating it with variation, going off on thematic musical excursions in the same key, and finally returning to the main theme with a brief grand finale. Keith Emerson's inventive and ground-breaking (for 1971) use of synthesizers as lead-melodic instrument is a particular highlight of `Tarkus' but all three of the trio are on top form throughout, with Carl Palmer demonstrating mastery of complex percussive time-signatures and Greg Lake belting out full-blooded, multi-tracked vocals and playing some mean electric guitar on `Battlefield'. Some sections of the piece are truly great.<br /><br />The original 1971 vinyl release featured the `Tarkus' suite on the first side and a curious odds-and-sods second side made up of two joke-numbers (the honky-tonk `Jeremy Bender' and rock-&-roll `Are you ready Eddy?' dedicated to their sound engineer Eddy Offord), two tightly structured hard-rock numbers and an interesting, classical-music influenced two-part hymn called `The only way'. As with Pink Floyd's material from this period, it's hard to think of any band in the 21st century which would offer up this kind of wide palette of experimentation to a listening audience, which is some loss to a more musically impoverished modern generation.<br /><br />Like the simultaneously released eponymous debut album, Sony's 2012 offering of `Tarkus' contains two CDs plus an audio-only DVD, presented in a 4-section fold-out featuring William Neal's distinctive `armadillo tank' cartoon artwork from the original 1971 gatefold album cover.<br /><br />The first CD features the original album mix produced by Greg Lake. The second CD claims to be `The Alternate Tarkus - new 2012 stereo mixes' but you'll need to listen hard to spot the minor differences. What you do get on disk 2, however, are 3 extras:<br /><br />* `Oh my Father' - a classic ballad from Greg Lake in the `Lucky Man' style (why wasn't it included on the original album? - Too personal maybe?)<br /><br />* Unknown ballad - with Keith singing (and yes, he can sing OK and in key)<br /><br />* An alternate take of `Mass' from the `Tarkus' suite<br /><br />The DVD is in 5.1 surround sound DTS & PCM stereo, and contains all the material from the two CDs. As with the simultaneously released debut album, all the 2012 remixing from the original 16-track recording tapes is the work of Grammy-winning sound wizard Steven Wilson. A 16-page booklet with period photos, full track listings and newly-written story-narrative by Chris Welch completes the package.<br /><br />This music sounds as good as it ever did, unbelievably fresh after 40 years. No-one - but no-one - is making music like this now. It almost seems that this kind of virtuoso, cross-genre musical innovation is dead; a pity.<br /><br />The sound - especially on the DVD, if you have the equipment to play it as it's meant to be heard - is good, but falls short of the excellent result on the eponymous concurrently released debut album. The sound on `Tarkus' is in fact a bit on the `quiet' side, Wilson perhaps sensitive to potential accusations of excessive `loudness' which mars so much modern music and digital re-issues by over-compression of the dynamic range. The sound is OK, though: just turn up the volume a bit, and it's fine. This, together with the lean offering of only 3 genuine extra tracks (in contrast to the large amount of extra material on the concurrently released debut-album package) for me demotes it to 4 stars.<br /><br />However if you don't have this milestone of the 1970s in your music collection, this is the definitive version to buy. Overall it's a fine package and great value at the asking price.amic range. The sound is OK, though: just turn up the volume a bit, and it's fine.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|As a terrific Lee Child and Jack Reacher fan, I find myself at a cross roads on this one.  I am so disappointed in the last book, and so disappointed in the choice of Tom Cruise for playing Reacher (unbelievable), that I don't believe I'll ever buy another Reacher book again.

B005LAII80|5.0|Just saw \\"Dredd 3D\\" at a midnight show. This is second time that the character Judge Dredd has been brought to the big screen. The first attempt was the 1995 version starting Sylvester Stallone. The old Dredd just didn't get it right, but this new Dredd does. The 2012 reboot is a dark, dirty, grim and ultra-violence masterpiece. It's really a simple film and it does not disappoint. I did saw it in 3D and it's one of the best 3D I have seen in long time. The effects brings the film to life and comes right out of the screen. Overall, \\"Dredd 3D\\" is worth your time if you love violence action films like \\"Escape from New York\\" or \\"Robocop\\". Full-price. A MUST OWN ON BLU-RAY.
B000J2DAYM|4.0|This is my First 'Review' - Didn't know anything about \\"Brick & was drawn to it by Joseph Gordon/Levitt - The only other 'big name' is Richard Roundtree in an almost cameo, but Nora Zehetner was a pleasant surprise for me - My test for a 'good' movie is whether it can NOT put me to sleep - The \\"Brick\\" kept me on edge all the way through - Was surprised to find myself watching a 'teenage' detective movie - made almost like a class project - would be interested in the actual expenditure on this - but drawn in & kept wondering \\"where is this going?\\" - The acting was adequate - don't see any Oscars here, but an entertaining & fulfilling flick for a Saturday afternoon - The 'repro' on my DVD was good, with NO problems & well handled by the Studio(s) - A Keeper for any collection of films.  JFJ
B005LAIHCM|2.0|Just saw \\"House at the End of the Street\\" aka \\"HATES\\" in a crowded theater. So many people came I even saw two girls sitting on the stairs. As for the movie well......I really wanted to like this movie, because it's JENNIFER LAWRENCE. But what I got was a wimpy mediocre PG-13 horror film for people who can't handle R-Rated horror films. The only thing good about the movie was the audiences. Yes the audiences was more entertaining and more compelling than anything I saw on screen. Don't go see \\"HATES\\" in a theater. Wait until rental IF your JENNIFER LAWRENCE fan.

B002JM1VJG|5.0|\\"Madonna Celebration: The Video Collection\\" is a fantastic 2 dvd set that showcases various songs from her successful career (22 music videos for disc 1 and 25 for disc 2).  At the time of this writing, Amazon US does not yet list all of the songs on both dvds but you can click on the second customer image for the complete listing. Currently, Amazon Germany would also be the place to go for the full video listing of both dvds. I chose to watch these music videos in order to get ready for Madonna's concert tonight. \\"Burning Up\\", \\"Cherish\\", and \\"Vogue\\" are among the videos on disc one that represent the early 1980's to the middle 1990's. Then, there is  \\"Ray of Light\\", \\"Music\\", \\"Love Profusion\\", and \\"4 Minutes\\" on disc two to represent the 1990's to the 2000's. \\"Vogue\\" and \\"Jump\\" are currently two of my favorite songs and music videos from these dvd sets. \\"Madonna Celebration: The Video Collection\\" is best for Madonna fans and/or those who like at least seven Madonna songs.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love this app but sometimes it does not load. but when it does I can stay on it for hours at a time.
B0091574VI|4.0|I don't think I would sit through the movie again but, excluding a couple occasions of slowness in the story, I did enjoy the film.  Of note though, I am a fan of Animal Planet and other nature shows and that, obviously, affects my opinion.
B005MW68RK|5.0|I've always been a big fan of Joe Bonamassa, but wasn't familiar with Beth Hart until I heard Sinner's Prayer on the radio. She blew me away with her raw, powerhouse vocals. I listened to a few more cuts of Don't Explain on Amazon before downloading the whole CD. This is one of those albums where nearly every song is a gem. The only two that don't quite live up to expectations are the title track, which sounds out of tune throughout, and For My Friends, which is mildly irritating.<br /><br />My favorite cuts are Sinner's Prayer, Chocolate Jesus (where Hart sounds like a cross between Janis Joplin and Edith Piaf), and I'll Take Care of You. On I'll Take Care of You, Hart keeps that big voice achingly restrained and Bonamassa gets a chance to shine as well. For those who are looking for the usual Bonamassa virtuosity on this CD, you may be disappointed. Except for this track, his playing takes a back seat to Hart's vocals.<br /><br />Still, the two of them together make a great pairing. I can't stop playing this CD.
B000N90JG8|5.0|A movie you will find yourself taking out and watching over and over, when you want a a good relaxing feel for an hour and a half!!
B008YP272M|5.0|A brave, honest and lucid insight into Christopher's approaching death. He retains the clarity of expression we've come to expect. Certainly gives cause for introspection.
B005LAII80|4.0|Now this is Judge Dredd! Brutal violence, nice visuals (including the CGI), good acting from everyone and a main character who is all about killing, but likeable in the process. Most of the action scenes are not that inventive and it is almost all gun play rather than hand to hand fights, but the simplicity works due to the sheer bloody carnage shown in each exchange.<br /><br />Karl Urban never removes the helmet, yet his mouth, chin and memorable voice add more personality than one might expect. A very good performance by him. Lena Headey, of Game of Thrones and 300 fame, plays a ruthless villain here. Not too over the top, but very believable and menacing. The young girl Judge who gets thrown into the mix because of her \\"mutant\\" ability to read minds plays off of Urban quite well throughout the movie.<br /><br />Yes the story is pretty weak and it's all about the action, but I bought and loved every second of it. Bring on Dredd 2!
030758836X|5.0|The writing, plot twists & character developement were amazing. This was my first Gillian Flynn novel but it will not be my last. The story was tight and plausible.

B000FBFN1U|4.0|Storm of Swords advances the \\"Song of Ice & Fire\\" story brilliantly, and is thus far the best in the series.  As usual, Martin delivers with twists, turns, and cliffhangers.  Anyone who has made it through the first two books knows well not to get attached to any specific character, and Storm of Swords proves that once again, this author is not afraid to off any of his creations.  Certain revelations at the end of this book left me stunned, and I can't wait to read A Feast for Crows.  A Storm of Swords was masterfully written and plotted, and I look forward to making my way through the rest of the series.

0143118757|5.0|There are a few books that have such relevance to so many aspects of daily life that they should be on everyone's \\"must read\\" list, and this is one of them. Although at first it might seem that this is merely one more addition to the seemingly endless pile of platitudinous self-help books that crowd the bookshelves and deliver little or no real worth, in fact this book is a highly pragmatic text on the process of negotiation. The authors don't pretend that negotiating will get you everything you want - in fact they are very clear on the limitations of negotiation and how to think of negotiation as a process that has strict boundaries. What the book does is make explicit the nature of negotiation, the types of tactics people commonly use, and the most competent method for pursuing negotiations so as to maximize the possibility of achieving a negotiated outcome both parties can live with. The text is clear, the examples simple to grasp, and the conceptual framework adequately developed. Nowadays we might add some learning that evolutionary psychology has provided, but aside from that this is a superb book that can enable enhanced outcomes in most realms of life, from family conflicts through business negotiations to community issues. The entire book can be read and absorbed in less than two hours, but the lessons can be applied over a lifetime.

B002OSY2T6|2.0|I ordered this toy when my daughter was about 3 or 4 months old hoping she would be able to chase it and learn how to crawl! Well the toy does not move! It is supposed to be a \\"go baby go, crawl along snail\\" but all it does is make \\"woo\\" sounds and play instrumentals to \\"if you're happy and you know it\\" IF you move the sliding lady bug on top of the snail! This was a waste to me. My child does not like this toy and it did not help her crawl.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|The two life proof cases I bought from this company were not like the ones you buy in Radio Shack. The side button that turns my ringer on and off did not work on either case. You could not take flash pictures, and my charger would not fit in the slot in the bottom. I went to radio shack and bought two new Life Proof Cases for 80.00 each, the exact same colors and they work perfect! I love them! But am not sure that the 39.99 cases I bought from this company were real life proof cases. They were in the same packaging, appeared to be brand new but had all kinds of flaws! I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning them through mail so I just ate the 80.00 loss for the two cases, but will never buy from this company again and I dont recommend that anyone else does either!

0385344333|5.0|Creative writing professors have been stuck on James Joyce for too long. I think a hundred years of exaltation is plenty for a dead guy. Professors who want to be relevant in the 21st Century should start teaching Lee Child. Where Joyce challenged the status quo and overturned dogma, his stories were aimed at a less educated, less traveled, largely agrarian society.  Everyone had firsthand experience with all four riders of the apocalypse: pestilence, war, famine and death. The world is a different place.<br /><br />Modern Americans and Europeans live in safer world. Our concerns about mortality are focused on dodging the Alzheimer's bullet before ninety. We need a different type of literature to excite a different set of senses. We crave literature that takes us on a joy ride and leaves us both thrilled and somewhat better educated for the time we spent reading it.<br /><br />We want literature that respects and honors our ten thousand-year-old fascination with heroism as much as it gives us the heebie-jeebies. We need it delivered in the no-nonsense, time-is-money, instant-gratification vernacular of our time.<br /><br />We need literature about pragmatic hitchhikers like this guy:<br /><br />...he walked under the bridge and set up on the eastbound ramp, one foot on the shoulder and one in the traffic lane, and he stuck out his thumb and smiled and tried to look friendly.<br /><br />Reacher was a big man, six feet five inches tall, heavily built, and that night as always he looked a little ragged and unkempt. Lonely drivers wanted pleasant and unthreatening company, and Reacher knew from long experience that visually he was no one's first choice of companion. Too intimidating. And right then he was further handicapped by a freshly broken nose. He had patched the injury with a length of silver duct tape, which he knew must make him look even more grotesque. He knew the tape must be shining and glittering in the yellow light. But he felt the tape was helping him medically, so he decided to keep it in place for the first hour. If he didn't get a ride inside sixty minutes, he would consider peeling it off.<br /><br />There, I've cut the quote off early and spared you the gruesome details of the tape peel. You owe me.<br /><br />Mr. Child sets the bar for literature in our time. Not because he sets a new standard for literary descriptions of common concepts delivered from new and unique perspectives. Not because it gives us ground breaking insights into interpersonal relationships and the intense longing inherent in our beings. Not because it defines man's inhumanity to man--or any of that other philosophical navel-gazing crap. (And yet, all those things are in this book.)<br /><br />What makes Lee Child's writing unique and worthy of collegiate study? Purity of Story. Nothing in Mr. Child's works interferes with the story. No extraneous subplots, no unnecessary background, no diversions, no red herrings, only the details that deal with murder of an American citizen in America's heartland. Every writer working today can read Mr. Child's work and learning something about the craft. I've read all seventeen books and learned something each time. (Stop laughing, I had a lot more learn than most.) His writing is so engrossing that even when we attempt to study a specific passage, we get caught up in the story and read right through it and keep going because we're on a rollercoaster and loving it. Like the passage below that creates plenty of tension from the minute details of a car ride:<br /><br />Reacher's eyes were closed and his nose wasn't working, so taste and touch and hearing were taking up the sensory slack. He could taste copper and iron in his mouth, where blood was leaking down the back of his throat. He could feel the rear bench's mouse-fur upholstery under his right hand fingertips, synthetic and dense and microscopically harsh. His left hand was in his lap, and he could feel the rough cotton of his pants, thick and fibrous and still slick with the manufacturer's pre-wash treatments. He could hear the loud zing of concrete sections under the tires, and the hum of the motor, and the whine of its drive belts, and the rush of air against the windshield pillars and the door mirrors. He could hear the give and take of seat springs as he and the others floated small quarter-inches with the ride. He could hear Don McQueen breathing slow and controlled as he concentrated, and Karen Delfuenso a little anxious, and Alan King changing to a shorter, sharper rhythm. The guy was thinking about something. He was coming up to a decision. Reacher heard the scrape of cloth against a wrist. The guy was checking his watch.<br /><br />Stop begging. That's all you get. Just read the book.<br /><br />Equally worthy of study are the puzzles Mr. Child includes in the opening of each book. The author opens with inane details like those above and reveals them as important and something you should have recognized. Almost as if he were tweaking our noses. The hero solves a few minor mysteries for you right away. This exercise serves to make the reader understand how smart the hero is and why we should trust him with the next ten hours of our lives. His established expertise allows us submit to the fiction. Reader submission is a key component of a good read. If we refuse to submit, we abandon the book. In this book, we see some mundane oddities early on that strike us as odd without knowing why they strike us as odd. Why is the water cold? Why matching shirts? What's with the gas gauge? And then Mr. Child exposes the reasons to the reader through the mental observations of the hero. And we are amazed. The revelations start like this:<br /><br />There was no element of self-aggrandizement in what he was saying. The guy wasn't making himself bigger or better or smarter or sexier. He was telling stupid, trivial, technical lies for no clear reason at all.<br /><br />Until the passage above, we were unaware that there were any lies. In the next passage, we understand how important the lies are, and from there on we can't put the book down.<br /><br />But wait. There's more. In 17th Jack Reacher novel, Wanted Man, fans are treated to the fun side of Jack Reacher. A refreshing side. He has a sense of humor:<br /><br />Then the phone rang in the office and the guy ducked back in to answer it. He came straight back out and said, \\"It's the FBI, for the man with the broken nose. That would be you, I suppose.\\"<br /><br />Reacher said, \\"Pretty soon it could be either one of us, if you don't stop yapping at me.\\"<br /><br />There are many other `Gems of Jack' that make longtime readers laugh. But don't think it's a comedy. Far from it. This is a serious book with serious and puzzling clues. What gets interesting is figuring out which bad guy is which and why. Guarantee you won't know until you find the Bible. (Not a spoiler, just a reference point.)<br /><br />Some reviewers like to poke holes in the plots of thrillers. I'm not one of those. If I were to read a Star Wars book, I would first believe in light sabers. If I were to read a Harry Potter book (no, I've not. Let it go.) I would believe in Hogwarts. The bad guys in this story stretched my ability to just-go-with-it, but not to the breaking point. I was able to put aside my WTF? and enjoy the novel. That said, part of me thought the bad-guys' raison d'etre might have been part of a joke on the reader. If it was, then it was clever. If not. Hmm. Well. Yeah, there could be light sabers out there somewhere. Probably.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are shopping for an MFA and there is no mention of class that deconstructs Lee Child, keep looking. In the meantime, buy Wanted Man and read it twice. Read it the first time for a great story about an all American hero (told by a transplanted Englishman, naturally). Read it the second time to appreciate the new standards for American literature.<br /><br />Peace, Seeley Jamesrous and still slick with the manufacturer's pre-wash treatments.

145162445X|3.0|Besides Lawrence Krauss explaining what science understands about matter and energy coming out of our reality's \\"nothing\\" (this universe's fabric of space/time); this book surprisingly serves as a nice introduction to the universe's origin and attributes as they're currently understood.  \\"A Universe from Nothing\\" services the cosmological topic quite nicely, but at the expense of what motivated so many of us to purchase this book after watching Dr. Krauss' now famous speech.  That speech went viral on YouTube because it contained a short segment on the current nature of \\"nothing\\"; according to Dr. Krauss instability sufficient enough to create universes.  Sadly, the topic of `nothing' is given short shrift here for a book-length treatise.<br /><br />For those who've read the Brian Greene books on cosmology and theoretical physics and were able to keep up, you won't be well served here since Dr. Krauss doesn't cover the state of theoretical physics at near the breadth or detail that Dr. Greene presents.  Except that is, when it comes to Krauss' hypothesis about how our [seemingly flat] universe arose out of \\"nothing\\".<br /><br />However if you're like me and find it a challenge to completely comprehend all Dr. Greene's explanations, Krauss' book serves nicely to re-introduce this material in an easier to understand mode, though a shallower more personal perspective than Greene's who makes an ardent effort to provide a more representative perspective of physics.  Most disconcerting is that Dr. Krauss doesn't spend hardly any time on the nature of nothing outside our own space/time, like what is our universe expanding into and other elements of nothing outside our own universe.<br /><br />I did greatly appreciate Dr. Krauss' lucid explanation of \\"nothing\\" in our space/time and why a net zero energy universe is an elegant explanation in reconciling a godless Big Bang, which is also consistent with our observation that our universe if flat.  But that material could have been covered in a long magazine article or the type of e-book-only volumes Sam Harris is now writing.been covered in a long magazine article or the type of e-book-only volumes Sam Harris is now writing.

B007ZBWJXI|3.0|OK, after holding back for a week now, I just gotta rant:  Being a HUGE Asia fan, I of course had high expectations.  After a first listen, what a disappointment...  an album of filler songs with dumbed-down lyrics.  At least Phoenix and Omega had 1 or 2 heart-grabbers.  Listened to it a second time, and it started to grow on me, but after listening to such great recent releases as Yes' Fly From Here and Steve Hackett & Chris Squire's Squackett, it remains nevertheless substandard.  Granted, Squackett and Fly From Here are not REALLY new music, but rather from previously recorded sessions years ago, but you'd think such talented musicians would rise to record something worthy of their 30th anniversary. The one redeeming quality of this album is Steve Howe's virtuosity, which just keeps getting better with time.  Fly From Here equally reflects his amazing guitar talent.

0525953728|5.0|This was a great book.  I know there are over 1000 reviews but I will just say to someone like me who sticks to the romance genre, I really enjoyed reading this book.  I love the Navy Seals but normally like them in romance stories.  I brought this book at Target instead of my kindle so both me & my husband could read it, which we both did in less than a week.<br /><br />The Bin Laden Raid is only towards the end of the book.  Its not this huge book focued just on the raid.  The book is from this one man, Navy Seal Mark Owen's journey to get to this mission.  It shows general pictures of training, deployments and a few missions including resucing that captian that made national news.  From an average citizen I didn't see anything in this book that was classified or stuff I felt we shouldn't know about.  Everything about the missions or training was general that you could look up online or at the library.<br /><br />I found this book very easy to read, it wasn't loaded with military jargon.  I now have even a higher respect for the Navy Seals and all military branches just reading about the scarfices they make for us.  I plan to keep this book and one day let my boys read it to show them true hero's!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is a genius when it comes to writing love stories and although Safe Haven is another masterpiece written by Nicholas Sparks, this book takes you on the other side of the traditional love story he usually writes.  With danger, suspense, and a combination of love, you are never going to want to put this book down.  Katie begins to fall in love, she struggles with the dark secret that still haunts and terrifies her . . . a past that set her on a fearful, shattering journey across the country, to the sheltered oasis of Southport. With Jo's empathetic and stubborn support, Katie eventually realizes that she must choose between a life of transient safety and one of riskier rewards . . . and that in the darkest hour, love is the only true safe haven.  If that description of the novel doesn't rush through your veins in a rush to purchase this book to read, perhaps knowing that as you read more and more, each word makes the hair on your arms stand on end and heart beat a little faster within each senetence just knowing that with every word you read, you are getting closer and closer to finding out how it all ends.  Whether you enjoy reading love novels or suspense and thriller novels, this novel is sure to fulfill your every hope when you open the first page.

0783225849|5.0|No, faithful followers of my Amazon reviews, you are NOT hallucinating. This isn't a dream and your drink has not been spiked. This is actually a five star review, not my usual trip down Amazon's darker paths to find the worst items available, instead it's a celebration of the great and the good. Five reviews of amazing music and movies that has rocked my world in the past. This is review number two. You are now officially Up To Speed. Let's go.<br /><br />More often than not, sequels aren't as good as the original movies. Some buck the trend of course; Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Knight Returns, Aliens and, if you're 10 years old, Terminator 2. An accepted rule seems to be though that not only are horror sequels never as good as the original, no-one ever really expects them to be. In fact, in the smug, self-referencing tedium of the Scream franchise (a franchise of diminishing returns itself), someone shouts out that \\"the horror franchise was destroyed by sequels\\" and then rattles out that horror sequels need to have more gore and more dead bodies to be effective. Pesky things like plot, characters, acting and pace? Naah. Who needs them, right? It's horror. Just kill teenagers. That's all the genre is good for.<br /><br />More often than not, though, this does seem to be the case. No matter how good the original film was, when it comes to sequels they just seem to be churned out, hoping the goodwill factor generated from the first movie will be enough to shift tickets. It ranges from great films who took their original premise and made it stupid (the Ring, Saw), completely lost what made their predecessor frightening in the first place (Blair Witch, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Exorcist) or, God help us, turned their monsters into \\"pop culture\\" figures of fun (witness Friday 13th 007 opening parody or Freddy Kruegar dressing up as the Wicked Witch of the West). In short, and almost universally, horror sequels suck.<br /><br />Except for Psycho.<br /><br />It's a pity that the widely available (in the UK, at least) boxset containing all 4 Psycho movies isn't for sale on Amazon, because that's actually what I'm reviewing today. Here's a franchise that doesn't sink into idiocy, it doesn't replace the central character, it doesn't take Norman Bates out of his motel and into New York or space. It doesn't have rappers as guest stars. What it does have is an intelligent, logical plot that runs through all four movies. The characters, from Janet Leigh's doomed Lila Crane right to Jeff Fahey's badboy scumbag Duane Duke in Psycho III, are all believable, perfectly performed and well written characters.<br /><br />Special mention must go to Anthony Perkin's portrayal of Norman Bates; cripplingly shy and undoubtedly haunted, it's an amazing performance from Perkins, who gives enormous weight and depth to a tragic character. Anthony Hopkins gets (deserved) kudos for his take on Hannibal Lector, but Perkins' Norman remains a criminally under-appreciated part. Timid, gentle and often terrifying, he's arguably horror's greatest acted role.<br /><br />You all know about the original movie, so I won't give too much detail here. Needless to say it's an iconic, ground breaking film, with a score and a scene that will be forever parodied and imitated. Regardless of how well guarded it was in the 60's on its initial release, the twist ending is now so well known to render it moot. No matter. Hitchcock's pacing, from the paranoia of Lila Crane in the opening scenes to the flailing basement light reveal of Bates at the end, is masterful. That much you already know.<br /><br />When sequels are made 20 odd years later and after the original director is dead and buried, you could be forgiven for expecting the worse. But Psycho II remains one of, if not the, greatest horror sequel ever. Instead of starting up again in a new motel or with a different killer, instead Bates returns to his motel, and its in this movie we peel back the layers of Bates andfind out just how tortured a soul he really is. Instead of some malevolent serial killer, he's possessed by memories of an abusive childhood, and it's the people around him who are the real bad guys this time. Personal note; I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 12 years old, and the scene where the teenage couple are making out in Norman's basement, only to be caught by \\"mother\\", has burned into my consciousness ever since. I can still close my eyes and see that scene. Now that is effective horror.<br /><br />Psycho III introduces new characters to the franchise but still harks back to the earlier movies, and features quite possibly the greatest twist on a classic horror shot. The now infamous shower scene that is mistaken as a hallucinogenic vision of the Virgin Mary is as surprising and inventive a take on a well-worn and recongised horror staple as any I've ever seen. Again, Perkin's painfully shy (but still undoubtedly dangerous) Bates has us actually rooting for the killer, without any winks to the camera or Kruegar-style camp catchphrases.<br /><br />Psycho IV is, admittedly, patchy in places and to the trained eye who has sat and watched all four movies in a row, gets some of the earlier plot details a little muddled. But it's still an entertaining TV movie, big in heart, and finally gives us a glimpse of what growing up with Mrs Bates was really like (Hint: not great) And, hey, if anyone deserved a happy ending, it's Norman Bates.<br /><br />So yes, horror sequels are, more often than not, shoddy imitations of greater films, content to throw blood at a screen and disguise it as being scary. Other notable exceptions to the rule include Dawn of the Dead, Paranormal Activity 2 and The Omen, but The Psycho franchise (ignore the remake) is the best of the lot. A towering central performance through all four films, a smart ongoing story and some genuinely frightening moments make the Psycho Collection I-IV (go get it on eBay) not only a must have for genuine horror fans, but a How To guide for any director wanting to create a frightening franchise. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go and board up my shower forever.<br /><br />And that, friends, is part two of five. What comes next? Only one way to find out...find out just how tortured a soul he really is. Instead of some malevolent serial killer, he's possessed by memories of an abusive childhood, and it's the people around him who are the real bad guys this time.

B008F5YDRI|2.0|seriously!  who let this film out of the editing bay without CUTTING it!  It has so much potential, and I thought it would a cute movie.  The only excuse I can give it is that they must have tried to follow too closely to the book... which was a mistake.  The film is WAY to long and tries to cover too many issues.  The only good thing about it is Emily Blunt, who is decent, but it's not even worth a rental.  So sad, it could have been a great film. (and I'm speaking as a professional editor).

B008MG1E4A|4.0|I have to admit I was sceptical about this book being an enjoyable read for me. My husband actually asked me to purchase it for him and it automatically downloaded to my Kindle as well so, I thought I would check it out. The story is more than just the operation that took down Bin Laden. It was an inside perspective on the individuals who are drawn to the demanding lifestyle of a SEAL. It is told in a straight-forward manner I found engaging and relatable. Previous books like those of Richard Marcenko, were very off-putting as I could not get past the bombastic egotist blather injected throughout the stories. In this book the author and his fellow SEALS are obviously skilled in ways most of us aren't, but they still come through as real people doing extraordinary things. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a truthful account of the mission to capture Bin Laden.

B00425S1H8|5.0|I ordered this adapter after replacing an older computer with a new one that lacked a serial port.  I use a Garmin 76S GPS and in order to download a track log, you must attach it to a computer w/ a serial port.

B0057UA486|5.0|Even among fans of the late director Stanley Kubrick, \\"Barry Lyndon\\" can be a divisive subject, with some advocating for the brilliance of the film and others insisting it's the most boring thing Kubrick ever made. Check out this excerpt from an Amazon reviewer who gave it one star: \\" ... 'Gone With the Wind' without any of the interesting bits. A boring film about Irish aristocracy, the only people who could possibly enjoy this movie are cinematographers and film snobs.\\"<br /><br />Well put, even if he didn't like the film and even though I disagree. Since I'm not a cinematographer, I guess that must mean I'm a film snob. And a really SNOBBY snob, at that, for I absolutely ADORE this movie.<br /><br />I will, admit, though, that it took a long time to grow on me. The darned thing IS awfully long, about three hours. And Kubrick's pacing, never all that quick (especially by modern standards) is just about glacial here. But this film is not an action flick; it's a study of character and mannerisms and class warfare. In the film, Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal), hardly an aristocrat, finds himself by virtue of fate cast into their company. He then embarks on a quest for power and riches, but finds it challenging, to say the least, to fit into this highly static, decidedly odd society.<br /><br />No, the film is not florid; if \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is your thing, \\"Barry Lyndon\\" probably isn't. The mood IS quite chilly; this movie is far more observational than participatory -- that is, Kubrick is meticulous in documenting the lives these people lead but stands at a distance from his own material, refusing to offer any real judgement or conclusions regarding the proceedings. People who like Kubrick tend to like that stance, but he does take it to an extreme here, and I've shown this film to some friends only to see, in dismay, that it's driving them absolutely nuts. By the one-hour mark, I can always tell whether the person is enthralled or would rather go and get ice cream.<br /><br />But the film has some marvelous touches. Marisa Berenson and O'Neal engage in a kiss that has to be one of the most memorable in screen history; Kubrick draws out the moment as if, instead of working with moving-picture frames, he is constructing the whole thing with paintbrushes.<br /><br />The painting analogy is accurate, by the way, for the whole film. Kubrick wanted to photograph some indoor scenes using only candlelight. He realized this crazy idea partly through the use of one, perhaps two, rather old film cameras sent to him by the film studio. Assuming they were his to keep -- others believed they were lent, not given (!) -- Kubrick proceeded to alter the cameras permanently by having technicians fit them with Zeiss lenses, ultra-high-speed lenses originally developed for NASA! They warned him this would basically wreck the old camera housings, or rather make them useless for any other application -- once the lenses were installed, the cameras could not be restored to their orginal configurations. Kubrick told them to go ahead ... WITHOUT bothering to inform the studio as to what he was doing.<br /><br />The result was a movie featuring some of the most beautiful images ever captured on film. Even detractors of \\"Barry Lyndon\\" agree that, visually, this is a landmark in cinema history.<br /><br />\\"Lyndon\\" also proved, once again, Kubrick's virtuosity; it was preceded by the incredibly violent \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" released in 1971, and followed by \\"The Shining,\\" Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's third novel.<br /><br />I heartily recommend the film, but only to those who still have not been seduced by the ultra-fast pace of our society now.br /><br />But the film has some marvelous touches.

B0044XV3R8|3.0|The shipping was quick and product well protected.  My only complaint is there needs to be more photos of the product as dvd holders are paper envelopes and I likely would not have bought it if I had known that.  Similar to the Harry Potter series not enough detail for my liking.

B003Y5H542|5.0|As a filmmaker and editor I can appreciate the often subtle nuances that for most people are nearly subliminal. For example, right after Dep's character, Rango, falls out of the truck and winds up on the side of the road. He goes to take a drink from his now empty glass and a drop of water runs down the inside of the glass... listen carefully and you'll hear the sound of a metal \\"swing\\" creaking and children in the background at recess. The swing was a good sound effect but it also added some depth in a subtle subliminal way.. that of the hot thirst of hard play on the playground when we were children. Prior to that the animation of the fall out of the truck was stunning to say the least. The story was good, Dep's acting was solid, the characters well developed. There was fun for all ages here, and again, details, lot of them.

I was introduced to the band about a year and a half ago so I'm not very familiar with their older work, as most reviewers are and refer to frequently.  For what it is this is a well written and executed work and stands by itself without relying on the past.  I will now, probably, look in to the past works of this group and will decide separately if I like that body of work as well.

B0087DFIYA|5.0|Mel Gibson fans this is a must have for your collection!  In this flic Mel channels his character from the movie \\"Payback\\" and does a great job!  In fact, he plays a bad guy, dirt bag, gotta love em anyway kind of character so well that you have to wonder how he ever played good guys!  I won't go into the plot, you can read that in the description.  All you need to know is that this one is great entertainment and one you will watch more than once.

B0002O7XW2|5.0|I was wondering how on earth a film about a murderous car would work, but checked it out because it's John Carpenter. I'm glad I did - this film has some genuinely creepy moments and tracks two best friends as the geekier one buys the classic car Christine and refurbishes it. He becomes obsessed and changes hugely - it is a fascinating transformation.<br /><br />The car's murders are impressive and, bizarrely, convincing. It's a great movie and is hugely entertaining. Check it out.

No big hassle there. Also, I've been using the app for more than three months and haven't had any freezes, crashes, or overheating that a few reviewers mentioned. I'm using the free version and have experienced zero glitches or difficulties. I am perfectly satisfied with this product.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|[forewarning: mostly cut-and-pasted from my review of [[ASIN:0439023521 the book]] for a reason]<br /><br />This movie appeals to me because<br />1. it convincingly portrays the plight of the poor [always touches a chord with me, coming from poor upbringings myself],<br />2. it illustrates the obliviousness of the \\"out of touch\\" privileged who feel that the poor should be PROUD to have their lives treated like the playtoys of the 1%, and<br />3. it covers believable [though I admit I'm not certain if AUTHENTIC] survival skills that level the playing field, as it were, in class warfare--Katniss wins because she has a greater desperation to survive than those from the upper districts who treat life-or-death as just another silly game and don't know what it's like to truly have to fight for one's life.<br /><br />This movie repulses me because<br />1. it glazes over the seriousness of the consequences of having a government in power that SANCTIONS MAKING ITS CITIZENS KILL EACH OTHER [though by the time the movie is established, the country has been crushed under an iron fist to such a point of general complacency that it's unfathomable that any of the repressed could have ever allowed it to persist for SEVENTY-FOUR YEARS],<br />2. the overall setting seemed rather understated for the future-based society they presented--I was underwhelmed both by the Capitol and every special effect used with exception of the Games control room, but mostly<br />3. it uses ALL THE SHAKY CAM.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong--the atrocity that is shaky cam is used to good effect, for instance, at the Cornucopia to suggest BUT NOT SHOW the gore of the initial Tribute deaths. However, I became quickly aggravated not five minutes into the movie when Prim wakes from a nightmare and SHAKY CAM EVERYWHERE. Where is your tripod, Camera Dude?? What is it about these still moments inside houses and other buildings that merits the jitter that gives me a headache in prolonged sequences? It's little touches like these that make what's supposed to be a blockbuster movie instead look cheaply-made, as though by a film student. Ten minutes in I was genuinely wondering if I was watching the same movie that did so well on its opening weekend, because I just wasn't feeling it.<br /><br />Overall, this is what I think doesn't work [***SPOILERS***]:<br />- The story doesn't begin until the Hunger Games start--there is so much haphazard effort put into world-building that Collins forgets to actually tell a story, something only somewhat alleviated in the movie with the propaganda film and the initial pre-game interview. Yes, there are things that are presumably important for exposition, but they are so drawn out as to read like a teenager's summer camp journal. Yes, the Reaping was a key emotional point, but--on the whole--the entire story could have been written more efficiently and covered more ground than it has. For instance, there could have been a dry introductory sequence with a third-person narrator describing the world, how the Districts' rebellions were crushed and the Hunger Games instituted. The propaganda film was a nice idea, but I don't think it worked as well as it could have, since I still only sort of understand what happened even after seeing it twice AND reading the book. The best effect was Katniss's fever dream showing how her father died in the mines--it didn't have to be narrated so much as shown in a few scenes, which I think could have improved much of the expository sequences.<br />- Katniss is good at surviving... but that's it. She's not really likeable except in that she has the sense not to glamourize death and wants to protect the innocent. In the book [which I read after the fact for comparison], she strings along Peeta as a survival mechanism--because it will increase her chances of winning and, possibly, avoiding having to kill him--and she has no real plans beyond \\"don't die.\\" At least in the movie, because we aren't subjected to her every meandering thought, I got the impression she might actually like Peeta back, and it was only when they returned to District 12 and she exchanged an awkward glance with Gale that I realized she had this unspoken love triangle going on and was being a butt about it. Oh, well, though! She likes Peeta now... wait, the book says she doesn't really? Nevermind, stopped caring about you, Katniss.<br />- Features? What features? I watched the DVD [it's not worth Blu-Ray] hoping to see some interesting deleted scenes and/or outtakes, but I was disappointed to see there were none of either. Okay, no deleted scenes means a more efficient movie process, but no outtakes, even?? The featurettes included interviews with the actors [eh], a few \\"making of\\" sequences [also eh], a sequence showing off how they used special effects to create the... mining village? Really?? I guess I don't get how difficult it is to make or go on location to a for-real mining village, but it struck me just how... INVISIBLE the movie effects were, other than the Games control room and the Muttations [which were comically awful]. Okay, sure, the Capitol looks like it took some work to create, but somehow I felt so uninspired by the Capitol as a whole, as though this was a place that really existed and all they did was go there and film it. And \\"on fire\\"? Underwhelming. Sorry.<br />- WHERE IS THE MORAL. I kept hoping there would be at least SOME kind of conclusion, some evidence that Katniss was changed by the Games beyond \\"Yay, I won... for NOW.\\" Nope, the movie is one big Chapter 1 of 3. I even skipped to the end of [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (Book 3)]] to see if the ending was worth reading the other two books--Katniss has two kids that Peeta has to TALK HER INTO HAVING, and they don't even have NAMES. What. It's comes across as not an ending so much as, \\"Well, I'm out of ideas. I'll stop here.\\" The obvious social commentary is lost under the \\"bread and circuses\\" of the spectacle--which may be the point, that we so-called civilized people are so out of touch with our humanity that \\"kids killing each other\\" doesn't bat an eye so much as gets our blood pumping to see more. What should be one of the most horrifying things imaginable is a mere amusement at the box office. Yes, you might say, \\"Well, it's just FICTION,\\" but can you really say there aren't still people in this world who want to see that for real? I mean, where do you think murderers come from?<br /><br />I've tried to like this series, honest. The movie's performance is a slap in the face to the sexist Hollywood producers who think \\"strong female characters\\" don't sell well because they think \\"strong female characters\\" consist of scantily-clad women performing ludicrous acts of violence to a terrible farce of a script. It's also a slap in the face to the racists who can't read \\"dark hair and dark skin\\" as being black [or even \\"not white\\"]--\\"It ruined the movie for me!\\" GOOD, I say. Really, though, there was so much promise squandered by shoddy execution, and as much as I've fished for the gems in the movie, I can't ignore the sludge I had to go through to get there.<br /><br />tl;dr: The movie's a little better than the book, but not by much.

IT'S WRITTEN IN PRESENT TENSE.<br /><br />For all the other problems the Hunger Games books might have, the use of present tense is the hardest to forgive, because it's such an unnatural expression of narrative. The only times present tense works is in scripts [because the action DOES happen as it's being acted], Choose Your Own Adventure novels or \\"Dick and Jane\\" books [because the reader is actively being drawn in as a participant], and instruction manuals [because it's the use of imperative]. I guess maybe in reviews like this, too, but not when I'm describing a thing that happened in the book--IT ALREADY HAPPENED. It is not still happening!<br /><br />Honestly, I would've given another star had all the action been past tense, but as it is, every sentence is the visual equivalent of fingernails on a chalkboard. I've had friends comment that the use of first-person is just as bad, that first-person should NEVER be used in a story--while I don't feel quite the same way to that extreme [I've read some good first-person journal-style stories], the series definitely could've been helped by the third-person perspective used in the movie adaptation, being able to see vs. taking it on Katniss's word that President Snow is a deeply wicked person, for instance.<br /><br />Overall, this is what I think doesn't work [***SPOILERS***]:<br />- The story doesn't begin until the Hunger Games start--there is so much haphazard effort put into world-building that Collins forgets to actually tell a story. Yes, there are things that are presumably important for exposition, but they are so drawn out as to read like a teenager's summer camp journal.

For instance, there could have been a dry introductory chapter with a third-person narrator describing the world, how the Districts' rebellions were crushed and the Hunger Games instituted. As an internal monologue, it reads like Katniss has to stop every ten minutes and remember something that happened years ago. Even having one character TELL the history of, say, Mockingjays to another character would read better than Katniss just remembering it to herself.<br />- Katniss is good at surviving... but that's it. She's not really likeable except in that she has the sense not to glamourize death and wants to protect the innocent. She strings along Peeta as a survival mechanism--because it will increase her chances of winning and, possibly, avoiding having to kill him--and keeps emphasizing how she has to put on a show vs. maybe being a little more honest and possibly risking the chance that no one will sponsor them. She has no real plans beyond \\"don't die,\\" and when they return to District 12, all she can think about is having to keep putting on a show for the people, OH, and maybe also dealing with the backlash from the hinted-at uprisings.<br />- Avoxes: Who cares. Okay, sure, maybe they're important in the other two books, but it feels like just one more \\"Look how evil the Capitol is!\\" hook, at the expense of doing nothing for the current book but filling space. This is improved with their omission from the movie adaptation, I feel--but then, I was one of those philistines who saw the movie first and read the book to see what they changed.<br />- WHERE IS THE MORAL.

B008220DIC|1.0|This is easily the WORST MOVIE I have ever seen. It's slow, pointless, and B O R I N G! There is almost zero plot, so it's hard to describe this movie to someone who has not seen it. At one point in the movie, Hoffman has Phoenix go back and forth in a room touching 2 walls, while asking him to describe what he feels. This scene lasts for over 10 MINUTES and it is repeated several times in the film.<br />This movie is truly awful. I don't know why it's getting such rave reviews. I want to scream at those enamored by this film, WERE WE WATCHING THE SAME FILM?!
B007I2BZIE|2.0|I applaud the fact that Rush are trying to create new music. I just don't really get it. To much singing and Geddy sounds to high pitched at times. I went and seen them in concert tonight and they only played about 4 of their great old songs at the end. The rest of the show was bad mostly. The crowd was bored they played most if not all of Clockwork Angels and alot other of the later year stuff that sucks.

B0092MKFIY|5.0|I bought the Imagine Dragons Continued Silence EP back when it first released based on a hunch that anything with such great cover art would be a fantastic listen.  I was blown away - complete perfection front to back.  Shortly after that I heard \\"It's Time\\" on the radio, and I couldn't help but feel a bit proud for being an early adopter of this new talent.  Flash forward a few months and their full length album has dropped and (while it has several of their EP songs filling the tracklist) it continues their new tradition of blowing me away.  Complete perfection, front to back.  These guys are wonderfully talented, excellent musicians, and have blessed us with a multitude of songs - each filled with a tremendous amount of passion.  Buy it now, and enjoy!
B00957T6X6|1.0|Like the other reviewer, I agree that this set is priced poorly. The set of the first 4 books was only $29.99. Amazon, if you're going to put a five-book set together, at lease drop the price of book 5 by a few bucks when you do it. Looks like I have to put off buying these for a few more days? weeks? months? until they're priced better.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This was a very good read, I did not see anything given away that would or should up set the goverment. In fact the White House told much more than this book. I think the best part is one must asked yourself \\"how do these guys go and do a mission and come home right back to a \\"normal\\" life of cutting the grass\\".
B001V5CIFI|4.0|We watched this movie for family night after having already seen the second Nanny Mcphee. It was enjoyable to watch for myself, husband, 9 and 10yr. old, and had good lessons for the kids. There was one scene that suggests inappropriate behavior that might not be suitable for all ages, but in context can easily be explained. Overall, it was a good film that our family enjoyed.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book - a tale of endurance and strength of character - made me want to don my \\"monster\\" and head out there!! Couldn't put it down.  A real story of \\"can do\\" anything you set your mind to. Well done Cheryl - will be looking for your next book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I was a sucker for this attraction when the carnival came to town and though I was intrigued by the idea of an Aneroid version I really didn't think I'd enjoy it like the real thing but I have to eat crow on that one... love it, requires just as much patience and engenders just as much frustration as the real thing, and I like the fact you can pick up enough extra and bonus coins as you play (and it regenerates coins when you're not playing) to keep on playing. You can buy extra coins if you want but you really don't have to, as you do with so many apps if you want to play more than once or twice a month. One of my favourite games on the Kindle.

The second and third book were also well written, However, I must say I was disappointed with the way the  ending weas written for the third book. . Felt it was just too rushed through. Almost like it had to be finished in a few pages.

B008GFI418|5.0|The 90-minute documentary on producer George Martin originally aired earlier this year on the BBC's Arena program. (it is supplemented on this wonderful DVD by 55 minutes of bonus footage - more on this below).<br /><br />If you are coming to this film to learn about Martin's work with the Beatles, you will find plenty here but you will need to wait till the 38-minute mark (on your DVD counter) for that info. That's because the classically-trained  81 year-old Martin started his career at EMI in the early 1950s (producing orchestral records and comedy records - mostly with Peter Sellers and The Goons) and, by 1955, was head of  EMI's Parlophone label. We hear (a few times) in the film that, before Martin, record producers \\"reproduced sounds\\" while Martin was the first to \\"paint with them\\". He was a true pioneer.<br /><br />There is a large section on those British comedy records and many of these artists will be unfamiliar to Amerucan viewers (remember this was made for the BBC), but they only add to the depth of Martin's career.<br /><br />As noted above, we soon get to the Beatles and Martin relates how they worked in the studio and what part each of the Beatles took in the recordings. What's great is that Martin is still alive and the film is loaded with interviews with Martin and the likes of McCartney, Starr, Michael Palin (Monty Python), Jimmy Webb in which the musicians ask Martin questions. Both McCartney and Starr discuss World War II in a non-music-related section.<br /><br />The interviewer who gets the most screen time is Martin's son, Giles, who is also a record producer (and CO-produced the Cirque du Soliel soundtrack for \\"LOVE\\"). The father-son dialogue is fascinating.  Along the way we learn about Martin's charitable efforts and meet his charming wife, Judy, who he met at EMI when he started there in the 1950s.<br /><br />The bonus material (totaling 55 minutes) features the extended interviews with Martin and his wife, the ones with Giles, and those with Palin and Webb which were excerpted in the film, plus new interviews (about Martin's influence on current record producers) with T. Bone Burnett and Rick Rubin. This supplemental material gives us an even deeper knowledge of Martin as person.<br /><br />An additional comment: Throughout the film there are \\"captions\\" at the bottom of the screen which provide additional info. These are in white letters and, in a few cases, are hard to read on standard def televisons. Not a major defect but if the letters were in color they would be easier to read when the background image is light.<br /><br />Eagle Rock has priced the DVD at a reasonable price and anyone interested in how the recording industry works (there is archival footage of the EMI plant from the 1940s and 50s included) or how the Beatles created their studio masterpieces will want to get this DVD.<br /><br />This is a review of the standard DVD version of this title. To my knowledge there is no additional material on the Bluray disc.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"with Palin and Webb which were excerpted in the film, plus new interviews (about Martin's influence on current record producers) with T.

B007PF7MGS|5.0|After soo much nutritional misinformation in the media, this book tells the reader finally and logically the truth. I live as an Expat for a multinational company in Asia and what I see here every day confirms exactly what is written in the book. People eat rice several times a day and are slim and fit. What else prove do you need that the Paleo diet and other low carb fads are wrong.

B005K0HDGE|3.0|Stephen King's latest take on the mechanics and intricacies of time travel is a fun ride, but he unfortunately keeps up the tradition of weaving a great story and then failing to finish it with flair. You can almost sense the point where he became tired of the story and just wanted to finish writing it. And, much like he did with Under the Dome, the ending also tries for a big reveal that only serves to confuse the reader more. In this tale, however, the character(s) introduced in the ending are completely unnecessary to understanding the entire plot. But the book is a huge one and there is plenty of plot packed into the beginning and middle.
B0091P6590|5.0|This is my favorite show on TV - the dialogue is quick-witted and sharp. The acting is excellent.  The scripts keep me hanging on for next week.  Must see!

B00005N6KG|4.0|Initially I used in-ear headphones when running, but they never lasted long and they would fall out as I began to sweat.  I then added the over-the-ear clips, but they too would fall off as I sweat or because my sunglasses would be in the way.  I decided to try these Sony headphones and they work perfect for running.  They don't fall off and they let enough of the surrounding sound in that I can hear cars or bikers.  But they also don't block wind noise.  They are cheaply made and my first pair likely won't last me much longer than 6 months, but at this price I can afford a couple pair per year and still save money over using more expensive in-ear headphones.

B000HB3QRG|5.0|Using his home studio for the first time, when this was released in March 1979 (Dark Horse 3255) it marked his 7th studio album and first since late 1976's Thirty-Three & 1/3, which had charted at # 11 on Billboard's Top 200 album charts early in 1977. With several friends on hand to contribute, including Eric Clapton, Gary Wright and Steve Winwood, it would gain the # 14 position by May, going gold in the process, and also produce the hit singles, Blow Away and Love Comes To Everyone.<br /><br />Released as Dark Horse 8763, Blow Away made it to # 2 on the Adult Contemporary (AC) charts and # 16 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in March/April 1979 b/w Soft Hearted Hana, a play on an old 1924 hit, Hard-Hearted Hannah by Dolly Kay, and more recently a # 55 Billboard Pop Hot 100 for Ray Charles in 1960. Then, in June, Love Comes To Everyone, featuring Clapton's opening guitar work, reached # 6 AC on Dark Horse 8844 b/w Soft Touch, also from the LP.<br /><br />Another side heard here for the first time is Not Guilty, which Harrison had composed in 1968 for The White Album by The Beatles, but which had failed to make the cut. The track Faster includes live racing car sounds recorded at the July 16, 1978 British Grand Prix, and on the inner sleeve there is a candid photo of Harrison at that event.<br /><br />Other musicians/vocalists not already mentioned who contributed to the album are: Steve Winwood who, in addition to backing vocals, also plays the polymoog (an analog synthesizer that can play multiple notes simultaneously), harmonium (a keyboard quite similar to a reed organ with a foot- hand- or knee-operated bellows that blows air through selected reeds, almost sounding like an accordion), and minimoog (literally a mini-moog analog synthesizer); drummer Andy Newmark; bassist Willie Weeks; percussionist Ray Cooper; keyboardist Neil Larsen (also on minimoog); Gayle Levant on harp; marimba player Emil Richards; and Gary Wright on the Oberheim polyphonic synthesizer for If You Believe. String and horn arrangements were coordinated by Del Newman.<br /><br />The tracks, all penned by Harrison except where indicated in brackets, are:<br />Side 1<br />1. Love Comes To Everyone - 4:33<br />2. Not Guilty - 3:36<br />3. Here Comes The Moon - 4:46<br />4. Soft-Hearted Hana - 4:03<br />5. Blow Away - 3:59<br />Side 2<br />1. Faster - 4:40<br />2.

B007M45PMU|4.0|I just recently heard \\"Ho Hey\\" by the Lumineers on the radio before I purchased the album. I checked out the band online and listened to a few tracks on thelumineers.com. I really liked the way they sounded and immediately used the link on the site to get to amazon and the digital album was only $6.99. No brainer!  Great buy for a great album.

B005LAII80|4.0|I'm not a comic book geek so I'm not familer with Dredd's history.  I'm also not a fan of the original Judge Dredd with Stallone.  I can say that I enoyed this version for the most part.  The film only gives us a brief view of the city before the action starts.  Otherwise most of the film takes place inside a drab high rise.  I had to see the film in 3D due to limited screenings for the 2D.  I'm not a fan of 3D or an expert but I thought the 3D FX were not that impressive.  There was plenty of beautiful slow-mo and close up head shots though.<br /><br />Karl does a good job as Dredd playing a man of action but few words.  The film is dark, bloody, beautiful and yes even a little poetic.  I hear that comic book fans were glad that Dredd keeps his helmut on for the whole film.  I for one had a hard time finding a emotional connection with his character.  You never see his eyes so I had a feeling of disconnect.  So Dredd remains a mystery at least to me but then maybe that's the whole point.  Who is Judge Dredd?

B008MG1E4A|4.0|Excellent account of the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden, wriiten by a man who actually participated in the planning and execution. All the phony stories out of the White House pale in comparison. I did not learn one fact about the Seals or their operations I did not already know or surmised, contrary to the Pentagon's bullying threats. The sad part is how these heros put the job before the family. They should have sense enough to stay single until they leave this way of life.

B0073U2F12|3.0|Along the lines of \\"Cloverfield\\" and \\"I Am Legend\\" this movie is about some strange light invading earth and wiping out humans and destroying all kinds of everything. The story is not quite as appealing as the latter two mentioned but interesting enough to keep you on your seat to complete the movie. For me a redeeming quality was the 3D which kept my interesting more than usual as the 3D effects were done pretty well. The one thing that kept me from giving it another star was that it was a bit slow for me, not enough action, but in the end it's an average flick good enough to sit through thanks to the 3D effect. A definitive rental and a purchase if you want a movie with cool 3D effects to showcase to your family/friends clean enough for younger audiences.

B006JSXYPA|5.0|This review is for the 3D bluray version of the movie. First of all what is with all of the negative reviews? I am a long time fan of the original cartoons but come on people it is 2012 not 1980s. Changes had to be made for a live action version of the series. A great continuation of the series. If you have a problem with the acting remember you are not watching The Godfather or Shawshank Redemption. This movie has plenty of action, humor, and suspense. Top it off with the 3D and you have the best Transformers Dark of the Moon experience ever. I watched the movie about 5 times now. First time in the theater (Real 3D) and then on bluray. Now that I have watched it again in 3D from a home set up all I have to say is, WOW. An entirely new experience makes an already great movie even more awesome. A must have, even if you already have the regular non 3D bluray, it IS worth the upgrade (I did).
B000002P6R|5.0|I had this disc in cassette format and I loved it. Finally I found it in CD format. This music never gets old, it is never unfashionable. Pop-rock in its most pure style.
B002ZG98UK|4.0|The Resident Evil movies have unfortunately in my opinion got worse and worse. I watched this in the theater and the 3D at the theater just didn't do it for me. I was actually disappointed I had spend the time to watch it. I decided to give it a go again since I heard the 3D was really good on this version. I must admit the home theater 3D made this a totally different experience and I enjoyed the movie way more than when I watched it in the theater. The storyline is not that great but what kept me on my seat was all the action, suspense and everything unfolding in a 3D world. Made me feel like I was there at times. A 3 star rating for the movie but the awesome 3D bumps it up to 4 for me.

B008D28HYS|5.0|CrossMe Color and CrossMe are the best in their class when it comes to logic picture apps. They contain puzzles with a broad range of difficulty, many much more challenging than what you will find in competitors' versions. Highly recommend as well worth the cost. There are lots of pictures to keep you busy, and the quality of the finished pics is way better than anything else I've seen for Kindle Fire.
B009DH371K|5.0|This is a terrific concert film of Queen's 1986 gig in Budapest. Although the shots/camera angles of drummer Roger Taylor onstage are frustrating during the first song or two - it's as if the camera crew struggled to get Taylor's face/head in the frame, clear of cymbals, tom-toms, etc. (Taylor is seen at better camera angles from song three or four on.) Be sure and get to the theater early (Sept. 27) or at least on time to see some 1986/85 in-studio footage and 1986-era interviews with all four members. There are at least three subtle hints by Mercury and the band during interviews that hint at Mercury's illness with HIV and, eventually, AIDs. When asked if Queen will return to Budapest to play another concert in the future, Mercury says, \\"Well, I'll tell you what. If I'm alive, I'll come back.\\" Queen never did. 1986 was the last year they toured with Mercury - Mercury already was ill at the time. Another interesting comment in the film during the interview portion has Mercury saying, \\"I want to make sure we're healthy to go out on the road again. I don't want to just go out there and do it.\\" There's excellent takes of \\"Under Pressure,\\" \\"I Want to Break Free\\" and \\"It's A Kind of Magic\\" included in the concert portion. Actually, all of the concert footage is good, and even the two or three mistakes have charm (Mercury's voice cracks once, but hey, it's live music, and he was already feeling the effects of cigarettes and HIV by the time they hit the road in 1986.) Leaving the theater, the viewer will agree that Queen easily is among the top five rock bands of all time, and Mercury's voice, preserved on Queen's albums and in their concert films, remains music's greatest male voice ever.

B00932A2MC|3.0|This is one of those movies that entertains despite itself. The dialogue is awful, filled with bad one liners and cliches that make you think it was written by a couple of teens. The story is a bit contrived and characters are your basic action movie cookie cuter types, nothing new or innovative in this movie.<br /><br />However, that being said, I some how found a way to enjoy it. It did deliver on action scenes, and some nice special effects. The one thing that makes this movie enjoyable is that you have the navy fighting aliens. Using everything from hand guns to big guns on the ship.  Too often in Sci-fi movies the military is nothing but cannon fodder, or they are so stupid they do nothing but get in the way.  This movie lets the Navy battle it out, and I do appreciate that.  So yes, the movie is entertaining and sometimes that is all you want or need.

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Update:  After I got to higher levels I found that if you place more rhan 1 coin down at a time; the faster you can remove prizes and special coins.  You do need skill to move items that fall to the extreme rght or left; but that is what keeps the game i teresting.  I got to a high level where if XP fell off the side; I still received the points.  Try it - keep playing - the more you play ; the more you like it.<br /><br />This an ok game.  It is very slow and boring.  3D Coin Pusher is a better reccommendation.  The 3D game moves faster and you can put tbe coins strategetly...casino slots and bonuses.  get that game instead.

B0013TXA5Y|3.0|While I love a good love triangle, this one just didn't do it for me.<br />First of all, Simon had this inability to be serious. I of all people can appreciate a dry, sarcastic, witty sense of humor, but come on people, there's such a thing as overdoing it. Everything anyone said or did was always met with a 'funny' retort from Simon. We're in the car on a very important mission, Simon is cracking jokes. Simon just caught me making out with Jace, Simon is cracking jokes. We just narrowly escaped a vampire hotel where we rescued Simon, who wasn't quite human at the time...Simon is cracking jokes. But it's not just him. Every single character in this book always has something smart to say. At first it made me laugh...then it made me smile wryly...then it made me want to bang my head up against a wall.<br />Second of all, Clary obviously wants Jace more than she wants Simon. One time in her inner monologue she says \\"Why hadn't she said they should go to Jace's room? The answer was as simple as it was awful: She had forgotten about Simon completely.\\" She had forgotten about Simon completely. The whole point of a love triangle is to keep readers on their toes. Should there be more attraction to one side? Yes. Should the other side barely exist? No!<br />I finished this book because it was extremely well written and I held onto the hope that Jace and Clary would finally end up together. Then at the end, a great reveal did three things.<br />1.) Pissed me off to no end. I literally got up, walked away, reflected on the book and screamed every curse word that came to mind. It came very close to ruining the whole book for me.<br />2.) Made it clear there would be no future for Jace and Clary. Well, that's not necessarily true, but if they did get together...let's just say the author might get more than a few negative comments.<br />3.) Made my decision not to read the second book. I'm a romance junkie, it's true. And when I start reading a book, whether it's in the beginningmiddle or end, I fall hard for a couple, and my mind will not be changed. (Travis Maddox and Abby Abernathy, Jude Ryder and Lucy Larson, Ember Walsh and Trace Montgomery)  I have no control over it, I can't say to myself, \\"Jack is nice and would be better for Jane so I want them as a couple,\\" it just doesn't work like that. Either I like two people together, or I don't.  And I don't like Simon and Clary together. At the very beginning of the book, My mind was made up on Jace and Clary, so when this big thing was revealed, I decided right then and there I wouldn't be able to sit through another five hundred pages.<br />So, while I loved the idea behind the book, and I can see why people would like the book itself, if you are a hopeless romantic like myself, I would not recommend City of Bones.
B003O86FMW|4.0|An enjoyable, well written story with appropriate twists in plot. I bit more of a teenager depth of characters but I only felt liking skimming in a couple places. Perhaps a little too heavy on the emotional conflicts of a teenage girl.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|From the first time I watched 500 Days of Summer up until now--I can't count how many times I've watched it-- it has been heart candy for me. Whether you are in a relationship, just got out of one, are in that \\"complicated\\" status, or are eagerly awaiting a new love, 500 Days of Summer is the movie to watch.<br />It is witty, romantic, heart wrenching, and realistic. Fairy tales can't give you the accusation of the terrible and wonderful world of love like 500 Days of Summer does. It shows you yourself if you are able to reflect. You recognize how you felt similar in your own relationships, flaws, perfect moments, and the realization of how the little things mean the most.<br />Though people may come and go, you know that there will always be an Autumn after Summer, perhaps a Winter after Autumn, a Spring after Winter, and perhaps even another summer. It gives you hope, feeds you in your disappointment, an nurtures you back to that hope when you realize you have to find that person who is all of the seasons for you, because each and every season you transition to has something special to be remembered and held onto.

B004EPZ06Q|1.0|I really enjoyed the first movie...so the second was a no brainer....right??  Save your money, watch the first one again. The second installment is just plain bad, they took the first story and changed cities / countries.....and made things make even less sense.
B009329Y30|1.0|This movie is awful from beginning to end- terrible plot, lousy acting, and a ridiculous ending. Also, with a rating of PG13, should 13 yr. old kids really be watching numerous intense sexual scenes between the main characters?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never enjoyed romance novels before and I started reading this and I couldn't put it down. I love how the writer made all of this sound so sexy. The love story with it was the best I have heard. This is a very sexy, erotic and romantic story in 1..The other two just make this story all come together and is a book I will be reading til the day I die....
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Good looking watch, easy to read, even for a old guy like me.  Keeps good time.  But would like to see it with a paracord wrist band.  Would like to find one for this watch.  Like it as much as my Swiss army watch, if not better.  Good feature of watch is that it doesn't need batteries.  Important when there are no more batteries available.  Would like it if it glow more at night to be readable.
B000PFT1ZU|5.0|I think I must have bought every cd & vinyl release of this just because it is all time classic, in my opinion it's Lou's best album it may not have sold as many as Transformer or Rock n Roll Animal when it was first released but the music speaks for itself.The live cd & dvd of the album are also worth investigating.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Don Miguel Ruiz packages a similar theme to Course in Miracles, Eckhart Tolle and Ramana Maharshi in exploring the illusory nature of our awareness of life. This is an easy book to read with a simple message packaged into four rules or 'agreements' that clarifies his message and translates the wisdom of the Toltec's into an everyday practice.

0307593312|4.0|All great writers need a great editor. While I was impressed by this novel, I think that it would have been even better if it had been about two hundred pages shorter. Of course, when you are a world famous writer, no editor can tell you what to leave out. I suspect the Murakami can publish whatever he wants in whatever form he chooses.<br /><br />Murakami's writing is as impeccable as ever. It is effortless to read his prose no matter the subject matter. The character could be making a salad or having sexual communion with a god and the prose is equally compelling. Sometimes, what I find most fascinating about Murakami's novels is seeing which questions he will choose to answer and which he will not; which narrative threads will reach a conclusion and which will be left hanging, waiting for the sequel which will never be written; which fantastical elements will be fully explored and which will only be suggested and accepted with insouciance no matter how mysterious and integral to the narrative; which characters will be painstakingly described and explored only to disappear and be forgotten. However, these are the charms and the frustrations of Murakami's writing and must be accepted if one is to enjoy his art.<br /><br />1Q84 is a great work of art. I do not want to diminish what Murakami (and his translators) have accomplished. I spent almost two months winding my way through the minutiae of the main characters' lives and thoughts in the context of a narrative that was both hyper-realistic and fantastical, explicit and allegorical, sensual and cerebral. Don't read this review; read the book, enter the universe of 1Q84 through the expressway emergency exit and experience how reality and fate can be altered and mutated, how love and the individual can triumph but where the elemental forces of the universe remain, just below our consciousness, shaping our lives and indifferent to all our actions.

B009AMAKSQ|5.0|The first time I found out about Perks was by hearing that Emma Watson got a starring role in it last year. Since I loved her in the Harry Potter movies I wanted to see it, but it wasn't coming out anytime soon. To pass the time I read the book and fell in love with it. It's a very moving story of Charlie (Logan Lerman) who is a very shy, sensitive young man who does not know how to interact with people. I am very lucky enough that I live next to New York and was able to see it on September 21, 2012 during its limited release.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything a very tragic event happened the year before he enters high school and it really messed him up enough that he had to go to a psychiatrist. When he does enter high school, and he's not completely \\"cured\\", he just cannot interact with people. He becomes a loner, unable to connect with anyone except for his English teacher. That is, until he meets Patrick(Erza Miller) and Sam(Emma Watson). They are two seniors who take him under their wing and show him how to live. They let him into their circle of friends and show him the hard partying lifestyle, which includes drugs, alcohol and sex. Don't be turned off by those subjects. Just because it doesn't fit the picture perfect image of high school some people have that doesn't mean it doesn't happen or that you can't learn from it.<br /><br />Each character has their own tragic past that they barely cope with, including the trio. I won't tell what they are so that you can see the movie and find out yourselves. However I will say that not all the characters get over them by the end of the movie, which is a plus since that tends to happen a lot to get the Happily Ever After ending. I would rather see that everyone has problems and they do their best to live with it and themselves.<br /><br />Now for the cast. The only ones I know are Emma Watson and Mae Whitman, who plays Mary Elizabeth. Emma has become much, much better at acting and getting into her character sinceHarry Potter. She has improved so much in this film that she really adopts being Sam and there's no trace of Hermione in her besides being the best looking girl there. I really felt like I was watching Sam from the book, not Emma Watson acting as Sam. As for Mae Whitman I only know her from Scott Pilgrim and Avatar The Last Airbender. She does a good impression of Mary Elizabeth though she doesn't seem as opinionated and, well, loud as her book counterpart. Still though she does a good job at it.<br /><br />The rest of the cast I just can't imagine being done by anyone else. All of them really got into their roles, especially Erza Miller and to a lesser degree (but still very good) Logan Lerman. Erza is a really good Patrick. He's charismatic, friendly and just full of life that it's not hard to put a face to Patrick after watching the movie. As for Logan he really does a good job of being the shy, socially awkward Charlie, but thankfully he doesn't cry nearly as much as his book counterpart.<br /><br />I really think making the author the director was a good decision, as the quality of the movie hinges greatly on the director. Having the original voice, the creator himself directing everything made it seem like I was watching the book be brought to life. Of course some things had to be cut out so the film won't run too long, but thankfully the rest made up for it. For those who read the books just keep an open mind on the things that were cut out.<br /><br />I admit, this is not a movie for everyone. Unless you can identify with Charlie or one of the other characters you would probably be turned off by how much drama there is in their lives. Of course there are universal themes like trying to fit in, find friends, and trying to win the love of that girl/guy that you really like. I imagine that not everyone can understand why the characters are the way they are or why they do things, especially Charlie. On the outside they seem to have a good life; having their ownclique, good friends and even normal worries like getting into a good college. However, look deeper and everyone is suffering from one problem or another. Yes, in reality everyone has problems but not the same problems and not to the same degree, hence why I say not everyone can identify with the characters.<br /><br />However, for those who have read the book this is an excellent addition to those who read the epilogue and was saddened that it ended. Being able to go through life with Charlie again, brought to the big screen by Stephen Chbosky himself, is a wonderful treat not to be missed.
B0084AVKZW|4.0|Truly a classic. This story had popped up in my childhood first as a Disney movie and later as an elementary school play. However, up until now I've never actually sat down and read the book. I wasn't disappointed.<br />If you are looking for an illustrated version, keep looking. This version is only text. It allows for the readers imagination to \\"see\\" the story. Some of the imagery is convoluted and makes this a challenge, but in a good way.<br />Nothing is better than enjoying a good book on a dreary afternoon. The remembrance of childhood was just an added bonus.

0525948023|5.0|I've had trouble finishing this book because I keep giving it away to others I think could benefit from it as I have!  Excellent, easy to follow and apply to one's own life and produce positive changes...not overnight, but with practice:)
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is not your typical book, though it is very much a coming of age story. However, even with that said, it has left me with a desire for more. This isn't the desire one typically feels at the end of a book, such as a longing for the book to never end, but more of a desire for closure. I believe Chbosky intended for the book to give the reader some sort of closure, but I believe he also fell short of accomplishing this goal. In the end, I felt the ending of the book was a bit rushed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It had a lot of twist and turns and was well written.  The book's ending was rather abrupt but not as bad as other reviewers.<br />Good read.
B005LLX582|5.0|I hope more movies are made like this in the future!<br />It definitely inspired me as an artist, and was DEFINITELY worth the whole 19.99 dollars.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|The only reason i finished the book is because i wanted to see what the big fuss was about. Very big disappointment. You need to buy the second and third book to see what happens but I dont want to waste my money. Reads as if it was written by a 6th grader.
B002ZG997C|5.0|Hard to go wrong with Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman. Great movie, keeps you thinking. Takes place after (The End Of The World) it's dark but has the action you expect. It centers around the bible but isn't what you might think, it didn't take away from the Movie or over power it. The ending is hard to describe so I won't, I liked it. Everyone takes it a little different. I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this Movie.

0007119275|3.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />This was a fun, page-turning little mystery, tightly plotted and filled with more jaw-dropping twists than many whodunits twice its length. Agatha Christie's first novel introduces her famous detective Hercule Poirot, he of the little black mustache and meticulous habits, who misses no clue and whose analytical brain races several steps ahead of everyone else (particularly his befuddled friend Hastings, who fancies himself a clever person, but is flummoxed by Poirot time and time again).<br /><br />Christie's deft handling of the plot left my head pleasantly spinning. Much of the fun of reading Christie comes from trying to spot all the important facts and keep up with Poirot's deductions. I had a couple of good hunches, but I'll admit, I did not guess the murderer's identity or anticipate the final twist.<br /><br />Dame Agatha must have had to sketch timelines of her novels in order to insert all the little clues in the right places and not to miss any during the d&eacute;nouement. In this first outing, I caught a few clues that were left unexplained and thought Christie's ambition might have outpaced her storytelling skills. However, my imagination filled in the gaps, and the omissions did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the novel.<br /><br />All in all, an enjoyable romp to spend the weekend with.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Stayed up until midnight on the release day so I could FINALLY get the longed-for copy of \\"A Wanted Man\\" on my Kindle. Practically drooling as I began to read....OK so, maybe I was tired, but I wasn't getting grabbed.  With every other book I felt I was THERE, part of the action, and with Reacher.  This felt oddly generic and distant.<br /><br />Have enormous respect for Child as a writer, and his use of words and language.  In \\"Persuader\\" for instance how can anyone wax on about a gun, and have it both be fascinating AND add to the story as though you could see the metal gleaming in front of you?  Genius! So went back and read \\"Wanted Man\\" again.<br /><br />Took a few days, but finally realized this is a hell of a story - puzzle box within puzzle box.  The dynamics of Reacher, Sorenson, McQueen and other characters are just what they should be when professionals who are strangers come together. There are some laugh-out-loud Reacherisms, and it's interesting seeing Reacher from another perspective.  Love the Puller shot (especially since I dropped Baldacci a long while ago after he pulled a \\"women like to be overcome by masterful men scenario\\" in a novel - bleagh).  And for me, tho it wasn't Iowa, being an Easterner going to school in Indiana was a shock (those mile of fields and flatness compared to what I was used to) so I can appreciate the landscape Child depicts in the dark.<br /><br />For me the issue is the writing - Child usually sweeps me into it, from the first second. His writing can be stripped down, spare, gritty, and yet paint an entire scene. But in this case I felt like I was handed a great, ratchet-up-the-tension story, but had to do all the coloring in and editing.  My own theory (after LC said in an interview that he was visiting the set while Cruise's film was being made, and that the movie-making process had influenced his writing of \\"A Wanted Man\\"), is that LC was distracted AND in a way, this book is like storyboarding a movie or TV show.<br /><br />Not good.  Because if you are making something that will be visual, you don't have to detail stuff that will be actually seen.  Or stuff that's seemingly dull (for me, the focus on the sheriff) can have more point when done visually.  And I assume people who write for a living generally hunker down for days at time, don't like to be distracted, and they focus. Like focusing on the climatic ending of this book might have been nice, rather than breezing through it.<br /><br />In the end I gave this 4 stars, because there are flashes of Child's genius all through this, and it's a hell of a ride.  But normally when I read a Reacher book all the color is provided by Lee Child, not me interpolating.  And for me it's the very first time I have questioned some illogical moments in a Reacher novel.  Like the blinking and head jerking would have been WAY too complicated, realistically, for ANYONE to figure out (reversing right and left?) And wouldn't Reacher have known to \\"dirty up\\" when doing stealth stuff at night?<br /><br />Think that's why the ratings are all over the place - depends on who you are as a reader, and this is a mix of an inherently terrific writer doing good, and not-so-good, in the same book.  In any case, I love Reacher, no-one else does it better, and hope it takes him a while to get to Virginia so he can get into more stuff.  As my own modest tribute to the character and his math skills, amused myself by doing a tally of all the Amazon \\"Wanted Man\\" reviews up to this date that mention being less than thrilled with Mr. Cruise portraying the iconic bad-ass Jack Reacher. Counted 58. Make that 59 with mine.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool was recommended to me by a friend of a friend, and I knew next to nothing about it when I bought it. What a pleasant discovery! For the first time in years, I found a book that was truly a captivating read, that consumed my imagination, that I couldn't put down, and that I continued thinking about after I was done reading.<br /><br />The characters are believable and interesting, and the reader's understanding of the world the story is set in continues to evolve as we keep discovering new things through the eyes of the characters. And what a richly developed world it is! This is a science fiction story that will appeal to readers even if they aren't science fiction fans - it's so suspenseful and engaging that it is very hard to put down. (One day, I worked a 19.5 hour work day, and was ready to collapse from exhaustion, and I *still* couldn't stop myself from reading it when I got home; it's that good).<br /><br />I highly recommend this book without any reservations! All I could do when I finished it was buy several other titles by the author (including the recently released Wool 6). Read this book, you will not regret it!

He hasn't read it yet but he loves the books from this series so he was very excited to get it as a gift. He is in second grade and thanks to this collection he started reading chapter books. The shipping was fast. In two days my order was received! I was also very pleased with the price being that Diary of a Wimpy Kid books in most stores are at an average of $15 dollars and I got it through Amazon.com for about $9!!
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I read the book but have not seen the movie.  I usually rely on these reviews here on Amazon to make a judgement on whether or not to buy the movie.  Overall, the reviews weren't all that promising so I probably won't even see the movie.  Also, since the movie cannot be purchased without Ultraviolet, is another reason I won't buy it. I enjoy having a digital copy but Ultraviolet is a waste of money for me. Go bother someone else's cloud!!<br /><br />Update:  I did purchase the movie and found not only the hated ultraviolet download, but also the ability to download the movie into iTunes.  This is greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Although the movie was still not as good as the book, it did touch on all the main points and gave one a convoluted idea of what it's all about.  Jennifer Lawrence was phenomonal in the movie, and seemd to be identical to the Katniss in the book.  I'm looking forward to the interpretations of the other books movies, I thoroughly enjoyed all the books.

B008Y1YK0I|5.0|The Blu-ray edition of Lawrence of Arabia is spectacular in every way. The first impression is sonic, with the overture by French composer Maurice Jarre played over a blank screen, soon followed by truly astounding images from the deserts of Arabia (actually Jordan and Morocco). The clarity, minute detail and brilliant color of the picture made it difficult to believe I was watching a fifty-year-old film. Every facet of the filmmaker's art is showcased here at an extreme level of competence and inspiration. Lawrence of Arabia's revered status with film fans can only be further enhanced by this high definition re-mastering.<br /><br />British director David Lean had long wanted to do a production based on T.E. Lawrence's autobiography, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom, but the anticipated scope and consequent cost of the film were prohibitive. With the success of his 1957 Bridge On the River Kwai (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor Alec Guinness) the necessary funding became available. The story of Lawrence, his Arab cavalry and their campaign against the Turks on the desert fringe of the First World War would come to the screen. The effort and expense were rewarded with another raft of Oscars for 1962, including Best Picture, Director, Cinematography, Editing, Musical Score, Art Direction and Sound.<br /><br />Two of the ten special features are exclusive to the Blu-ray, one being an interview with Peter O'Toole many years after the film was made. The other exclusive feature, the only special feature on the disc with the film itself, is called Picture in Graphics - Secrets of Arabia. I was not enthused, thinking this would be a mere gallery of production photographs, but it turned out to be a very special device for students of the history of film or of T.E. Lawrence. It is an extensive combination of commentary, maps and historic photographs. These are all intercut and superimposed on live action from the film, from opening scene to closing credits, including soundtrack.  Have you ever wondered while watching a fact-based film, \\"how valid is this depiction?\\" Well, here's your chance to find out.  This extra feature offers superb detail, allowing one to construct a more nearly complete and accurate story. Scene after scene, the events, locations, actors and characters are commented upon.  For example, we find out that the two boys who attached themselves to Lawrence as servants in fact existed, and both died in the course of the war, but not under the circumstances depicted in the film.<br /><br />This is a superb Blu-ray production, fully worthy of an exceptional film.

B007C6HHOM|4.0|Visually awesome and it IS an engaging story. However, it's not for everyone, particularly for those with small children at home....<br /><br />(1) WAAAAAAAY too much sex/nudity. I'm no prude, but did I REALLY have to see a major lesbian sex scene while the main scheming character explained his motivations?<br /><br />(2) Unbelievably violent for a TV show.<br /><br />(3) Major, major plot holes. It is supposed to be about competing houses and competing plots. But. One prostitute character (the one who somehow keeps appearing in scenes where the male characters are engaging in naughty behavior while explicating their plot motivations) could rule the world based on the information she overhears.<br /><br />(4) Like ANYBODY would let a dire wolf be a pet for a five year old boy.....<br /><br />(5) Did I mention too much sex? When I was 15 that would have made me go 'hubba hubba,' at this age, it makes me hit the fast forward button.....<br /><br />(6) Oh, and everybody is gorgeous and has perfect teeth. Like that happens in thirteenth century England, right?<br /><br />(7) The bit with the George W. Bush head on a spike? Not funny.<br /><br />In short, a gross cross between Lord of the Rings and The Sopranos + Rome.  Like I said, not for the kiddies....

B0054X3FQO|5.0|Miranda has proven an amazing author with this book \\"Treasure Yourself\\", and it fulfills the title, because I have been able to treasure myself more, as well as the world around me, as a result of this book.<br />As someone that suffers from depression and anxiety, I have always turned to finding a higher self through yoga, meditation and other exercises. While they do help my mood and confidence, they don't exactly change the way I perceive the world. Miranda's lessons in confidence, acceptance and wishful thinking has inspired me to listen and look around more, be more compassionate, grateful, and optimistic, and driven me to pursue more charity work. I'm in the process of making changes to help the environment, and finding a charity or cause to devote my time to. All because this book has inspired me to do so. I find the mantra's at the back very helpful. I wrote down many of them on slips of paper, folded the paper into little origami stars, and put them all in a jar. Now every morning I take a star, unfold it and read my daily mantra.<br />I should note that I have for many years dreamed of being a Victoria's Secret model, and so advice to chase your dreams and pursue your passion from someone that has achieved what I hope to in the future, is golden.<br />Finally, I love the flower illustrations in the book, each draw by a different woman. Each flower is beautifully drawn, and very different from the next, and it reminds me that were are all beautiful, but in different ways.<br /><br />All in all, a lovely book. Hope this is the first of many to come!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Bad written but good at the concept that the author wanted us to understand. The trilogy made me use my imagination at all levels! I was really sad to finish the trilogy. I cant wait for the movie ;) if you are NOT open mind then u will not find this novel interesting and arousing!
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Great story.  My son and I both liked this book...good flow and kept our interest.  Would recommend it to readers of all ages.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I KNOW THAT THIS NAVY SEAL BROKE A CODE BY WRITING THIS BOOK AND MAYBE HE WAS WRONG- BUT WHEN YOU READ IT- YOU<br />CAN UNDERSTAND HIS FRUSTRATIONS WITH HOW THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN CREDIT FOR EVERYTHING AND HOW THEY<br />SPUN IT INTO A HOLLYWOOD TYPE EVENT.  THESE MEN LAY THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE, FOR ALL OF US, AND TO HAVE THE JERKS IN<br />WASHINGTON MAKE IT INTO A POLITICAL PAT ON THE BACK FOR THEM NO WONDER THEY WANT TO TELL \\"WHAT REALLY HAPPENED OVER THERE\\".

B005LZW8FO|2.0|I will not retell the description of this movie. Many have, I'm sure, in their own reviews. But I will say Another Earth wasn't quite my kind of movie. It was interesting, but it didn't keep me glued to my seat. I had a feeling if I walked away for 15 minutes and come back, I wouldn't have missed a thing. But I sat through the whole thing, and I felt like this movie was empty of emotion and empty of content. How can one connect with any of these characters when only their shell is being presented? That's how I felt. Okay, she was tortured and you will know why right from the beginning, and the gentleman is tortured, as well. But there is no depth. If the gentleman's family would have been presented more, maybe the hurt would be more meaningful.<br /><br />I also felt like the aspect of the 2nd planet earth was a footnote, not really an important part of the story. It was just a way out of the sadness the characters were in. The writers could have easily replaced the concept of a second planet with a trip to a deserted island, and it wouldn't make a difference.<br /><br />If this movie dealt with either the accident in the beginning and the results of the accident or the 2nd planet, I think it would be a better movie overall.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the entire series, Hunger Games. This is first young adult book I've read and I was surprised how well the characters were drawn, how compelling and frightening,the futuristic view was , and how the balance between action and reflection was so sharply written.<br /><br />I was disappointed when the final book, Mockingjay, came to an end, but the culmination was satisfying - and secretly I began envisioning (and hoping for) another three books.

B005HP2J66|5.0|Herzog's meditation on the beginnings of art, perhaps that which differentiates our species from others, centered on the amazing pictographs found in the Cave of Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc in France left this viewer very satisfied and raring to go to a 3-D presentation in a theater. Like his film about Antarctica, Herzog found great characters to tell a story that is far beyond a simple presentation of scientific facts or conjecture. From a perfume creator with his almost superhuman nose searching for drafts that might smell like a cavern that had been sealed for thousands of years to archaeologists and artists Herzog interweaves stunning footage of the cave itself, a lovely musical soundtrack, and artful questions being thoughtfully addressed. He leads inevitably to a young scientist who relates a story of Stone Age awareness coming from Australia in which the Aboriginal artist does not consider himself as the creator/editor of work, but merely as the conduit. Herzog is typically searching for greater universal meaning in his world and this film is no exception. He proposes that the beginnings of spirituality were what distinguish modern humans from other species, and this is what is driving the creation of art. This is a stunning work of subtle beauty.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|making me review for update..up yours.. great game tho<br />but this is annoying haha but id buy it if I didn't get it for free haha
1401229921|5.0|I bought this based on title alone. I figured it would come with extra content like an interview with Jim Lee or something. Turns out it was quite the opposite. It had less content, but still more than I expected. This book has no colorings, instead, it was the original pencil  drawings from Jim Lee! I will purchase the final, colored version. But I'm very glad to have this edition on my shelf.
B003H9MSPG|3.0|I had high hopes for this gun. I thought this gun would be the best gun ever for Humans vs. Zombies on campus but I was wrong. While it does shoot up to 35 feet like the package say, other guns can easily out shoot it. The Nerf Retaliator shoots at least five to ten feet farther, and the Nerf N-Strike Nite Finder EX-3 (a single shot pistol) and Nerf Rampage shoot just as far. This gun is also inaccurate and the darts do not stay straight during flight. I really would not recommend this gun to anyone and $30 is over priced. I would recommend the Retaliator over this one-- costs less, it shoots farther, more accurate, and holds more darts in the clip. I made a mistake getting this one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun game and cheaper then going to the fait since its a free app. So if you add it have fun.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This is probably the stupidest book I have ever not finished reading. The characters are shallow, the celebrated sex scenes are so plentiful they became predictable. Ana bit her bottom lip...flushed or blushed....had earth-shaking orgasms and imagined what her inner goddess was doing so many times there wasn't much room for any real story.<br />I am just disappointed in myself for falling for the hype and wasting my money.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|This review is for the audio book obtained from Audible for American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History by Chris Kyle with Jim DeFelice and Scott McEwen.<br /><br />Chris Kyle was in every major battle of the Iraq war and was wounded twice. He has 160 confirmed kills out of 255 claimed kills as a sniper. You may have seen him on TV recently on Stars Earn Stripes and Sons of Guns.<br /><br />I listened to this book as I traveled across Texas a couple of weeks ago. I took the ensuing time to analyze my emotional response to the book and to figure out what I really thought about this rather unusual story of a deadly SEAL's military career.<br /><br />The very talented John Pruden is the narrator for American Sniper. He did an amazing job and offered a credible West Texas twang. He sounds very much like Chris Kyle who was born and reared in the Odessa, Texas, area. My husband, who also has that kind of Texas drawl, wasn't offended at all by the faux Texas voice.<br /><br />Amazing long distance shots and close quarters combat are presented matter-of-factly and honestly without Kyle trying to pretty up his actions. He tells it all, dispassionately until he talks about his fellow soldiers. That's when his emotion comes across. He makes the point in the book that he didn't fight to free Iraq. He fought for his country because that's what he was ordered to do, and he fought for the lives of his fellow soldiers. These men don't get to pick and choose their battles or the way they're even used. Often politics and higher-ups create as many challenges and dangers to these warriors as the enemy.<br /><br />The insurgents, the ones he called the bad guys, or savages, were the ones Kyle sought in his sniper scope. The more bad guys he could pick off; the more Americans he might save. That was the bottom line for him, and it's a bottom line I'm forced to respect.<br /><br />This book awed me, and it made me cry. War is hell, and that fact is never so evident as when Kyle talks about his friends who died so tragically.<br /><br />I am not a person who thinks deadly force and violence are never called for. I'm a realist -- maybe because I've lived in and visited enough third world countries to know how truly idealistic and naive most Americans are. At the end of Kyle's book, he quotes something that a friend of his, another SEAL sniper who didn't make it, said: \\"Despite what your momma told you... Violence does solve problems.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, I agree with that assessment. Why unfortunately? Because I'd prefer to live in a world where diplomacy and common sense ruled, but that's not the case. Force of action and violence are what pulled the world back from Hitler's quest for world domination.<br /><br />Soldiers like Kyle perform like super heroes on the battlefield, but the post-war is often not easily won. To do what Kyle did, a man has to compartmentalize the softer emotions. In fact, I think it's safe to say that a man must become a different person -- someone who can use violence to solve problems and use it damned fast and expertly.<br /><br />In the end, what happens to that changed person when war is over is the bigger moral question.That question is unflinchingly presented by Kyle and by his wife Taya, whose viewpoint is also given in the book. Taya Kyle speaks openly about the challenges of being the wife of a SEAL, and, often, the only parent that the children may know, and about how hard it is to find the man she loves inside the returned warrior.<br /><br />This book is riveting, gut-wrenching, and unforgettable. It's not just an extraordinary war memoir that gives readers a glimpse of what the whole Iraq situation is really like. It's also an emotional and moving story -- warts and all -- about a hero's journey from ordinary citizen to warrior and back to ordinary citizen -- if one could ever call an ex-Navy SEAL sniper ordinary.s never so evident as when Kyle talks about his friends who died so tragically.<br /><br />I am not a person who thinks deadly force and violence are never called for.

B004KZDV8E|5.0|The i3-2120 is among the best processors one can find for a budget build, and coupled with a decent graphics card it will run anything at high or even maxed out settings. First of all, this CPU is almost identical to the i3-2100 which is only $3 less at the time of this writing, the only major difference is that this model has a higher clock speed, so I would certainly recommend this over the 2100, and I personally own both and both are great for everyday use, but if you are looking for budget gaming I would pick this over and AMD APU and just about any processor in this price range. I am currently writing this review on a budget build I completed about a month ago, and it is running perfectly along with 4 GB of RAM and a GTX 560, this combination is good enough to max out any game I throw at it so far (Blacklight, BF3, Minecraft, Skyrim, anything really). If you are considering this CPU for gaming on a budget, you want to spend much more on the graphics card than anything else. If you are looking for a strong rig under $700 pair this CPU with a GPU in the $175-250 price range. Installation is incredibly easy and the stock fan keeps it nice and cool. I strongly recommend this CPU for anything from daily use to gaming builds under $800.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this Bible is the bomb diggity lol no its not its just cool you can sorta personalize it cool right
B007IXWKUK|1.0|garbage.  Insidiously introduces the idea of torture and manipulation over a young woman with misleading ideas about love.  She is tricked into this world.  The world of domination and submission is a clearly agreed upon arrangement between individuals who enter into it with eyes wide open.  Written so poorly in places I had a difficult time even following the syntax and line of thought.  total Garbage

B002B79BVO|4.0|I liked this season but the first was a lot better-- this one had a few odd episodes which I'm hoping will be better explained in season 3-- I heard season 3 is better so I'm sticking with the show. And how can you not love hotty John Hamm?
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|I am a dyed in the wool Lee Child fan and this book did not disappoint me.  Lee Child is a fantastic story teller and you are involved with Jack Reacher and the plot from the first sentence.  All the characters are well constructed and believable and you become involved in the plight of heroes and villains.  Five stars from me.

B006MH04PG|4.0|In common with most literature deemed \\"classic\\" Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, presents us with timeless moral quandaries and timeless characters as well.  I reread this book in advance of seeing \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\", which paled in comparison to the book.  The book is a short, powerful read and perfect for kindle.  One of my friends (thank you C.J.), mentioned that is some ways Dr. Jekyll is like Dr. Frankenstein, in that both believe they can create a perhaps healthier mind or a perfect mechanical being.  Good intentions don't always lead to good outcomes.

B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Ryan Gosling first caught my attention when he played the loner with a blowup-doll girlfriend in Lars and the Real Girl.  He recently showed his dramatic skills in Blue Valentine and his ability to do comedy in Crazy, Stupid Love.  Whatever film he is in, you can't take your eyes off him.  He does more with less than any actor I have seen.  Drive is the perfect vehicle for his minimalism.  His entire script for the film is probably no more than a page or two.  He doesn't even have a name.  He is The Driver - a Hollywood stunt driver by day who moonlights driving getaway cars.  His style is best described as smart and unbelievably cool.  So we are surprised when The Driver reveals that he is capable of a wide range of roles, depending on what is called for, from lover and benefactor to brute and killer.  The true existential hero, he leaves you wondering, \\"Who is this guy?\\"  Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn makes his Hollywood debut with this highly stylized, often beautiful and graphically violent film.  Refn describes it as something of a Grimm's Fairy Tale.  The rich gallery of supporting performances are flawless as well. The film and Gosling deserved every award available.  Too bad they were virtually ignored.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|No doubt you know that Secretariat was the crowning glory of horse racing, winning the Triple Crown in 1973.  What you likely do not know is the role his owner, Penny Chenery, a southern steel magnolia, played in allowing this horse to \\"run his race.\\"  Chenery stood up to the old boys' club, an arrogant trainer, her brother, and her husband, then grasped the reins of the team of groom, newly hired trainer, and jockey to manage the career of this amazing horse.  She literally \\"bet the farm\\" and didn't flinch when she could have lost it and her marriage as well. What a horse!  What a woman!  What a film!
B008MEM24S|5.0|its a great game I love it so dose my daughter. we cant wait to play the game again. we want more levels please.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I wrote the review about the Michael Jackson: Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour [[ASIN:B000A2RRF4 Michael Jackson: Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour]].  I actually went to the Dangerous concerts but never got to see the Bad concerts apart from some of the unofficial ones on tape which were poor quality so I waited a long time for this DVD.<br /><br />To say this DVD is earth-shattering is an understatement, the concert is raw, dynamic and totally exhilarating.  The best thing about it are the close-ups of Michael, you will never see him up-close like this ever.  Of course we are used to seeing his energy which always lights up a stage but in this concert you see him at his very best, his movement is amazing and you see a happy Michael who is at the top of his game musically and dance-wise.  The vocals are incredible, the sound from this DVD is sharp, clear - almost electric and it pierces through the speakers.<br /><br />This is taken from Michael's personal tapes which were Super VHS.  In case you don't know Super VHS is almost equivalent in quality to DVD so the quality overall is excellent.  No it is not HD but lets be honest, if you really want to see a 'raw' concert then you don't need it.  This fits in with the time of the concert which was in 1988.<br /><br />I am not going to speak about all the individual songs, every one is incredible and shows the different dimensions of Michael but I will say that Dirty Diana is my favorite.  Michael is known for his ballads but he is the perfect live Rock musician and Jennifer Batten with her distinctive mane of bright white hair is a brilliant accompaniment to MJ.  The performance is awesome, the singing, the guitar, the energy - he blasts you out of the stadium!<br /><br />I can't recommend this concert enough, if you want to see Michael as we were always supposed to see him then this is the concert to watch.  In my opinion it is better than Dangerous and even History which I also saw live.<br /><br />Last note: Michael Jackson is a genius and one the best live performers ever, we should respect his legacy and this is a part of it that should not be missed.<br /><br />Track Listing as follows:<br /><br /> Live at Wembley Stadium July 16, 1988<br /><br />1.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is awesome. If you loved playing it as a kid at the local fair, or at an arcade somewhere, then you'll love this version just as much... probably even more, because the great thing about it is, NO EMPTYING THE QUARTERS FROM YOUR PIGGY-BANK! You get all kinds of bonuses, extra coins, prizes, and extra experience points... and well... it's just really fun. So give it a try... you'll be glad you did.
B0048EANOM|2.0|Ordered this title for my growing Blu ray collection as I really enjoyed this movie on theatrical release and DVD. Took nearly a month to get to me(I live in New Zealand) but was a couple of weeks earlier than Amazon had estimated so a bonus I guess.<br />I found this Blu ray version of JFK to be of very average quality picture wise but rather than blame a poor transfer I think it was more to do with Stone wanting to invite the viewer into to an emotional laden storyline than worrying how good this movie would look in 1080p.(Of course Blu ray was not mainstream when this movie was released) but as this version was released in 2011 it perhaps couldve been a chance for Warner Bros to really give this film the once over that I believed it deserves.<br />The 5.1 Dolby THD soundtrack is also of average quality but better than my DVD version but there seems to be a small technical glitch where the sound and picture appear out of sync in several key scenes of the movie. I have a 2011 Panasonic Blu ray player and a PS3 and it did this on both machines so maybe its due to the fact of a poor soundtrack transfer Im not sure but Im not impressed.<br />Overall Im glad I have this movie in my collection now(Currently not available for retail in New Zealand at this point of time) however I do believe that this version could've had benefitted so much more from a decent remaster(picture and soundwise)to enhance what is an enjoyable watch and arguably a great movie.

1416972250|5.0|City of Glass essentially leaves off where City of Ashes did. Clary is getting ready to go to the Glass City with the Lightwoods. Simon and Jace do not want Clary to go so they meet up in hopes to keep her from going, but instead Simon ends up in the Glass City. Clary ends up there eventually and so begins the war with Valentine.<br /><br />You meet so many new characters in this book as well as more character development for existing ones. I love Simon more now, you are shown so much about his personality that wasn't shown in previous book, and I really love him as a vampire. I also love Isabelle. I have always liked her but in City of Glass she is more than just a tough girl, you get to see other sides of her. A lot of the characters I won't talk about because it will give away plot points, and they were a nice surprise when they came along-kept your attention.<br /><br />Compared to City of Ashes this book was amazing! I went from loving City of Bones to just liking City of Ashes to loving this one! Such a strange cycle for a \\"trilogy\\". I loved City of Bones sooo much and then reading City of Ashes I wanted to give up on the series. I am so glad I decided to continue because it was amazing. There is so much action and quite a few twists and unexpected plot points, it really sucked you in till the last page.<br /><br />The Mortal Instruments series is now more than a trilogy so I don't know how I will feel about the rest of the books. The ending was extremely satisfying so I hope it just doesn't get dragged out-I will continue reading it though.
1936608898|5.0|Loved this book -- the authors do an amazing job of presenting their arguments for a proper diet (I mean lifestyle, not short-term) with real science but keep it accessible to the non-science inclined (me). I have completed one of their Whole30 programs and can attest to its benefits -- and can also attest to the complete opposite effect once returning to mediocre eating habits. Whatever your personal health goals or standpoint, I highly recommend this book and program, there's nothing weird about it, it's all actually very intuitive.
1423124111|5.0|This is one book that every Disney fan must own on their shelf. From the early Disneyland to the recent DCA posters, if you love the posters then you must pick this up. All of the art is stunning and its amazing to see it so clearly and beautifully. The pages that show the screen printing process are awesome, and the posters never seen before are worth it at any price.<br /><br />Its a shame the book isn't shrink wrapped as this allows it to be difficult to find in great shape, which is so important for a book of this magnitude. Let's hope they fix that in future printings.
B008I3QZKU|1.0|I can't believe this band wrote HOT FUSS.  Sounds more like Brandon Flowers solo stuff (which I liked better).  I think I will stop buying KILLERS albums before listening to them....
0345803507|4.0|the story became less interesting and somewhat boring by the third book.  even though people laugh when i said i read it for the love story and mystery, i was pleased that the author said she intended it to be a love story with some kinky sex.  i also felt as she did that much of the appeal is the phantasy is just as much about christian as the ultimate male with looks, money, success, kindness, intense love and wants to and does take care of all a woman's needs.  i got bored with the sex because it seemed repetitious, particularly in the description.  the ending was somewhat predictable and even the mystery surrounding jack wasn't that surprising.  the first book was interesting, the second somewhat but by the third i skipped a lot of the sex stuff to quickly get to the ending.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|Everyone is talking about how the game is a demo, or how you have to buy it, or controls, or graphics... did anyone even think to look at the permissions list!? It's as long as my arm. i mean... really? bluetooth pair (maybe for a bluetooth controller)? There is not reason they need access to all of my active running services, thumbnails for each, and what activities the services are running. i dont even have time to explain the other stuff.<br /><br />This is a cheap game, given as a free demo, masked as a free app of the day, so Namco can data mine to their heart's content.<br /><br />I'm not normally a permissions freak, but this app takes the cake...
B007SGM084|5.0|Could NOT but it down! Read the paperback trilogy 3x. Loaded the trilogy to my Kindle Fire too, just want the option to read it again IF the mood strikes me.<br />  The character development very enjoyable & uplifting. Her words create a movie while reading. Worth every hour of lost sleep I spent reading!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this app is extremely simple and yet is amazingly fun, the awe and boos of the crowd make it a little more entertaining and all the prizes and coin types are a nice touch
B002N7P23I|4.0|It was a good movie I  normally would not watch a dubbed movie but it was well worth it. I recommend it!
B009329Y30|2.0|The story line was slow and predictable. It was a nice movie, but really never got moving. And the two main characters had little chemistry.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This is a must watch movie, especially if you like the books. This movie has such a great premise, you get caught up in the world and will obsess over it for a long time. They picked a perfect cast for this movie to, everyone does an amazing job. I would definitely recommend this movie.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was surprised by the great acting performances. The film translates the novel without losing too much detail of the original plot which is always an issue with book to movie adaptations. I'm looking forward to the film adaptation of the next novel in the series.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|DISAPPOINTMENT<br /><br />WATCH IT FIRST , AND THEN DECIDE IF TO PURCHASE OR NOT<br /><br />TO MY OPINION: THE NATURE SCEENS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT IMPRESSIVE AND BEAUTIFUL<br /><br />POOR ACTING !<br /><br />VERY BAD ENDING TO MY OPINION<br /><br />THE MOVIE SHOULD ALSO HAVE MUCH MORE ROMANCE SCEENS AND FEELINGS , EMOTIONS , BUT IT'S NOT !<br /><br />THE SEVEN DAWRF - RIDICULES ! A JOKE !<br /><br />WHEN I WATCH A MOVIE , I WOULD EXPECT IN THE END TO FEEL - WOW .. IT WAS IMPRESSIVE ..<br />BUT NOT THIS ONE!<br />IT MAYBE START GOOD , AND THEN - GOING DOWN<br /><br />IN A WAY , I THINK I CAN COMPARE IT TO END OF THE MOVIE - THE EAGLE - WHICH ALSO HAS A BAD ENDING, AND ALSO WAS MADE BY UNIVERSAL STUDIO'S !<br /><br />IN FACT, BECAUSE OF THE BAD ENDING I AM NOT GOING TO PURCHASE THIS MOVIE !<br /><br />If we do not laugh, cry, get excited, as we watch the film, so what's the point ?<br />A film with such an end ... Take the fun out of seeing it again ever !<br /><br />It seems that Universal Studios do not put an emphasis on the end of the film<br />They finish the film quickly and pass to the next project..
6305176299|5.0|Arrived quickly and in excelent condition.  If you have not seen this movie, then you MUST!  It is truly entertaining.  \\"Speed\\" has tense moments, humor, and a great cast.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Fun game. Want more!  Some levels are genuinely tricky, many easy, but still gratifying. It is like a certain game with ticked off avians, but from a head on.perspective.
B009329Y30|4.0|I think this movie was an excellent move for Zac Efron from the teenager he played in High School Musical to a man's role in The Lucky One. He is a great actor and this movie displays his talent.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the entire series despite finding the author's style a bit clumsy at times and feeling certain key characters were poorly drawn.<br /><br />The key to this series and where the author really deserves credit is in constructing a first-person narrative that forces you to turn the page. I read all three books on my Kindle going to and from work, on breaks and in lunchtimes, in a matter of days.<br /><br />Although I won't say the story or the characters are memorable enough to stay with me, the series is perfect 'pulp fiction' entertainment. If you want something that will absorb you on the commute to and from work, this trilogy is ideal.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I could not put down this book from the beginning-it kept me on the edge the entire time!  A definite must read!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like it but the designers did a great job. It was free so I took a chance. Get this and enjoy.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just like these machines you see at the arcades, the game is strangely addictive,yet completely pointless. be warned, you may find yourself paying real money to buy more coins to keep playing. coins regenerate for free, but as a general rule (as with many similar apps with in-app purchasing) you are limited to a few minutes of play while waiting and waiting until you cave in and pay. overall this is a fun, addictive game but completely pointless.
B006ISJQ1W|1.0|I don't usually write reviews but I watched this today and couldn't not write something.  I rented it from my library so at least I didn't pay any money, just wasted my time.<br /><br />I've held off renting it til now because something about the write-up on the back of the dvd told me I probably wouldn't like it.  Today I figured, what the heck; how bad could it be?<br /><br />Wow, is this movie bad!  Johnny Depp and Aaron Eckhart must've needed some extra pocket change when they decided to do this movie.  The writing's bad through and through and actually manages to make Depp look like a bad actor.  At least Eckhart was his usual charming self, even with a terrible script.<br /><br />I kid you not, this is one of the worst movies I've ever wasted my time on!
B00001OH7M|5.0|I once owned this albumn, but in moving I just could not keep carrying with me all the records. I sold my albumns. I decided to re-buy some of the music I owned and I'm glad to get this one on a cd. Thanx!
0765342294|4.0|Ender's Game was a surprisingly refreshing take on the space opera genre. Orson Scott Card's characters were well thought out, each having their own distinct voice and personality. There have been too many novels in this genre with characters with flat personalities that have been virtual clones of already written stereotypes.<br /><br />***Contains Spoilers***<br /><br />Ender, the protagonist the in the novel's title, is a mentally gifted child in a future earth. When he interacts with other children and adults, it has a realistic ring to it. The story arc never falls flat, and the thought provoking ideas within are first rate. The book is difficult to put down with each chapter flowing into the next.<br /><br />**** End of Spoilers*****<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction, or even to those that don't. This novel is driven by the characters more so than future technologies. Great and enjoyable read!
B007RX32TY|4.0|Essential for any late night reflection period. it's fuzzy and at times meandering...like the recollection of a dream. Visualize rain on a window, and mix in a subtle but pulsating dance beat. Lyrics tend to be cryptic which allow the listener to wallow in their own interpretations...many highlights are to be found but my pick for killer track would be the heartbreaking, yet pulse pounding...these streets will never look the same.  And kudos for the entire record being so listenable and consistent, front to back!<br /><br />my only caveat is the record feels inconclusive...the story ends rather abruptly.<br /><br />If you like being alone, italo disco, and new wave....you'll love this record.
0307913147|5.0|\\"Ready Player One\\" was recommended to me by a co-worker. I ran off to the local bookstore to get a hard copy, and just couldn't get into the story in the first couple of chapters, so I didn't buy it. But, then, facing an 18-hour drive, I asked friends on Twitter to recommend something and \\"Ready Player One\\" was suggested once again. I took a chance and got the CD version. I'm SO glad I did. Maybe it's me, or maybe this is just a story that is better to listen to than read. (shrugs)<br /><br />I don't think you need to be a gamer to enjoy this story, but it did help to connect me to the characters. I remember reading another reviewer saying something about all the 80's references, and I think that actually help endear me to the story. I had an even stronger sense of reference.<br /><br />I was literally saddened to have the story end. I'm miss the adventures of Z, H, and Artemis! Highly recommend this set. Have already loaned out my copy to another friend.
0375413405|5.0|This cookbook really does read like a regular book, with paragraphs on professional-style slicing and dicing (with graphics), pages on sauces, definitions, techniques on boiling and simmering included in the recipes, and it even lists all the types of pots and pans, what they are called and how to use them, and even how to choose them! Details on copper vs steel vs nonstick, etc. And I've only read the first 200 pages so far (skimmed the rest quickly though). I highly recommend reading this straight through like a regular book once or twice, just get a general overview of details regarding technique, to improve basic skills. I am very impressed with this book and have already made several recipes from Julia Child including cream of mushroom soup, chocolate mousse, asparagus with onions, ground beef with onions, and boeuf bourguignon. Next week I'm planning coq au vin...these are not very \\"easy\\" recipes, but they are very tasty and you won't be disappointed. The ingredients are listed to the left of the recipe in each step, which I thought was going to be weird but I got used to it after the 2nd recipe. Planning on buying the second book ASAP. :-)

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Loved this game!!! Very good storyline and graphics. Big fish knows how to make an entertaining game. Ready for part two!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a really cute app and it is great for all ages. I usually favor puzzle and word games but I really like this game. There actually is more to it than it seems. There are prizes involved that you can exchange for more coins and there is somewhat of a technique required to &quot;level up.&quot; My 3 year old likes it a lot too!
0345803485|1.0|O.k so you already know what the book is about, but the way it is written<br />is funny.  Take a virgin, a handsome billionaire, and you get kinky<br />sex, really!!!!!....I found myself laughing at her language and feeling sorry<br />for herself every time she opened her mouth. She sounded like a love sick<br />16 year old with the common sense of dirt.  It might be worth the read, if<br />you have nothing better to do!
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Engaging enough to leave you wanting to know more about the characters. Good action and effects. Suitable for kids and adults.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I ordered this book on Kindle for my husband. He isn't much of a reader of books, but loves reading on the Kindle. He said he could not put the book down--and he didn't! He even quit watching TV which for him is unheard of! He said it was fabulous and wants me to read it.
B0012IWHUU|4.0|I bought this soley on the video I saw on Nitro Circus DVD season 1 disc 1. I absolutely loved that banjo rift. I keep playing that video over and over. If I bought the Green Day cd \\"Dookie\\" from listening to one song (Longview) I can't go wrong with this Dropkick Murphys cd.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest and this app makes it easy to navigate on my kindle fire.  I'm glad that I downloaded it.

B008602KQI|5.0|Great cast, great story, great director, great writters, all based on a GREAT book. Its as simple as that. I'm sure everyone was sceptical about how the movie would be because books are always ruined when turned into movies, but this was done so well! I can't believe how good it is! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!! Can't wait for the next movie to come out!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|great game I love this game and all the other team lava games only thing is they require wifi if if didn't it would be amazing

B007UPNA6Y|1.0|If I had read this Jack Reacher book first, then I would never have picked up another book by Lee Child!  Utter disappointment does not properly describe how I felt after waiting a year for one of my favourite authors to release his latest Jack Reacher book ( which by the way was the first and last time I pre-order a book, clearly it jinxed this into the worst book I read in the past year).<br /><br />The story line is flat, in fact is it worse than flat, it doesn't make sense, and it looks like the book was written by someone else, maybe a few someone elses. So much so that Baldacci's recent book with the character, Agent Puller, was more Reacher-like than<br /> this.<br /><br />No way Lee Child could write this poorly I immediately thought.  None of the usual wit, or kick-*ss action. No setting of the scene, no big entrance by Jack.  Just this boring on and on about nothing.  It felt as if I really was there on that roadtrip, wanting to scream, are we there yet?! Short choppy chapters with no purpose. An ending that is completely amateurish, and lacklustre, with zero believability.<br /><br />It felt as if Lee child stopped and started this book so many times, he lost the plot (excuse the pun), and then when his publishers started putting on the pressure, he quickly finished it the last week before it was due. Did he get paid so much for the movie rights to One Shot that he has now lost all interest in writing?<br /><br />So here is your score card Lee:  16 spectacular wins, and 1 monstrous loss - good odds that your next one might be a winner again, just not this time!
B0091REZMW|5.0|pretty good game.!!!! I like that there are so many collections to find. I don't like all the diamonds uou need to have.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game fun to play very time consuming to see if you can the high scores or just win.  The best game there is
B003L77GG0|5.0|Every season of Smallville has been wonderful. I am sorry to see that number 10 is the last season. The series had wonderful young actors, especially for a television series. I just hope the actors can go on beyond Smallville to have a successful acting career.<br />Thank you.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|With the 1920's Prohibition as the dropback, this is a great period piece set in the original sin city - Atlantic City. Great cast, great characters.
0240815807|5.0|I work at home but I don't do \\"homerecording\\". I own a professional small studio and I though I would get some nice creative tips.<br />This book is for beginners and it repeats the usual technical basics.<br /><br />review update:<br />I give two different ratings<br /><br />- my new rating (5/5) for the overall content and the author's attitude.<br />- 2/5 is my personal rating because I was expecting a different approach. The missleading word for me was \\"secrets\\" I guess.<br /><br />n.b.<br />and yes, I also bought the Mixerman books, Behind the glass, Rick Rubin and Bruce Swedien,... and I'm really only after \\"details\\". Dave Pensado said in his last show \\"...our show becomes more and more the studio's kitchen...\\". People are less and less \\"tea boys\\" or assistants in real big studios. Many of us are alone at home and need insider information to stay tuned.<br /><br />Best !

B000HIV0FY|5.0|It's hard to imagine that a story can be told just through email, or that a never ending email chain would be funny.  But Matt Beaumont has managed just that.  First of all, it isn't just one email chain between the same two characters.  It's multiple emails between various members of the same office, which just highlights all the deceit and back-stabbing which goes on when you read that what someone tells one colleague is completely different to what they tell the next one.  There is a definite story to it - it's not just inane emails about nothing.  This book is hilarious and I can't recommend it highly enough.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|gameplay is good no storyline but all in all pretty good. graphics are great.....,..........if you don't have this game at least try it
B0087HT36U|4.0|fun and can be hard. well worth the price, nothing. that all i have but you need 20words to stop

B0081L37Z0|2.0|There were some funny parts in this movie but not enough to counter all the distracting language.  This movie would have been much better without all the foul language.  I'm not a prude but in this case the language was over the top and definitely detracted from the over all experience.
B0088RQ4TI|5.0|This movie got a bad rap, the family enjoyed it very much. We will watch it again. We will probably buy the actual disc so we can take it with us.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I love the variety of music on this album! What you hear on the radio is only the tip of the cake (ice berg is too cold and depressing) :) Can't wait for next album! For now it's on repeat in the car.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|The 20th Century's finest musical poet, Bob Dylan, has done it again! With his 35th studio album, \\"Tempest\\", Dylan again raises the bar of writing & recording excellence to such a level that it now rests beyond the reach of all contenders for his crown. Simply put, \\"Tempest\\" is stunning, & easily ranks amongst the best albums of his career. From the swinging \\"Duquesne Whistle\\" with its honky tonk rhythm that begs you to start dancing, to the driving \\"Narrow way\\", to the outstanding title track, a 13 minute, 55 second epic of the Titanic disaster, \\"Tempest\\" presents a showcase of the best of Dylan's rare writing gift, as it magically weaves his storytelling wand, and captures & holds the listener. There are stories of life & death, of darkness & dread, pain & redemption, a mosaic of songs that challenges to listener to address life's darker issues, while at the same time, refusing to allow the human conscience to lie idle. There is only one Dylan - contenders for his crown come & go, but Dylan remains! \\"Tempest\\" is one the finest moments of his extraordinary career, and in my opinion (for what that may be worth), the best album of the year. Somehow, giving it only 5 stars, seems so inadequate. Outstanding! My best purchase in years.
B005LAJ212|5.0|For a camping trim in an area without regular TV available, we wanted something that would fit into potential inclement weather periods.  Revenge (the complete 1st season) was the right choice.  Commercial free on 5 discs, each disk was about the length of a movie.  Turns out this was a great alternative to 5 different movies, and got us psyched up for the second season starting next week.  As usual, service from Amazon was timely and accurate.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was wonderful- so much better than the movie. I liked how insightful Katniss was and how all o he characters were developed.

1936608898|5.0|This program is amazing.  They promise to change your life,  and they actually deliver.  I've found great relief from autoimmune issues by following the guidelines set forth in this book.  I know that changing what I put on my plate changes my health. I've taken control of how I feel.  I've taken control of my attitude.  I've taken control of my choices.  For me, it all started with food.
0743277708|5.0|I remember like it was yesterday instead of thirty years ago the first time I read Watership Down. I couldn't put it down. I read it at night, and during odd free moments at work. I picked it up again as soon as I got home. For the week I read WD, I was a rabbit. I , too, admired the unexpected leadership of Hazel. I, too, worried about our nervous prophet Fiver. I, too, loved my world of Frith (the sun) and El-ahrairah (our mighty rabbit folk hero) and I, too, was terrified of Lendri (badger) and Pfeffa (cat) and I, too, was mystified about the white burning sticks.<br /><br />Happily, I decided to read this book again with my online 1001 Children's Books You Must Read group.<br /><br />And, happily, the book held up. Delightful.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|love a good mindless game from time to time. It is cheaper than the arcade. my kids think it is fun so its a winner for me.
1936608898|5.0|I have to say, I've never read anything else about nutrition and diet that left such an impression on me. This will change the way I eat for the rest of my life. I never knew just how little the food industry is concerned with the well being of its consumers and I will be a label reader from now on. Most of my meals will be prepared in my own kitchen and I will make as many special requests at restaurants as necessary to ensure my own well-being. I'm amazed how many places do not even offer a side of vegetables with your meal.<br /><br />I'm also amazed at how many lies about nutrition have been propagated by food producers over my lifespan. Did you know the low fat craze is actually really bad for you? Or that for a country with the highest dairy consumption in the world, we have the highest rate of osteoporosis?<br /><br />Once you get through the Whole30, you'll find that eating a paleo diet isn't hard. I know it seems very restrictive, and the W30 is, but eating paleo is actually easier than than our old way of trying to make good food choices (and often failing). You have far fewer decisions to make. You simply select your source of protein, add twice as many veggies, choose a fat to either cook your food with or consume on it's own, and supplement those meals with fruit on occasion. Super easy! Especially once you get the hang of cooking in quantity so you have leftovers. And you know what? You'll feel so much better. And your mood will improve. And you'll have energy!<br /><br />You don't have to take my word for it. The educational portion of the book ends halfway through and won't take you long to get through. Reading it could change your life. Just read it. Then decide if you want to try the diet. I bet you will.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Absolutely a great read. I gave it 5 stars for an engrossing account of how it really happened. Thanks for your service.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|an outstanding game. up to level 50 then it didnt start again and right after i obtained over 100k in gold. xxxx u. its a kick butt. and worth the replay value. moreover its simple and easy. when you get to the great slaves its 100 a kill and only takes 75 times every 2500 gold pieces for every completion. this game deserves a penchant for and from old timers. dont ever get old.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I am enjoying The Tudors series for the second time, this time at my leisure, and I savor each episode.  I will undoubtedly purchase the second season when I am finished with this one.  The series was an excellent program on Showtime, and watching it again is pure pleasure.  The attention to detail is perfect.  The period costumes are gorgeous, and of course, the acting is supurb.  One never grows tired of watching Jonathan Rhys Meyers' portrayal of King Henry VIII, and definitely not the same Henry VIII you envision in the history books!  Love this series. It is television drama in its most excellent form.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Having read  dozens of books about Special Forces from various years of our history; I would have to say that this book is well written and of course, very interesting. You have to reserve judgment on the subject of whether or not he should have written it to begin with. It is not a very complex book but nearly a biography of a young man who is driven further than most. He is loyal to his values which you may observe to be a rare behavior in our messed up culture. It is easy to see why the Obama corner was not anxious to have the book published. On the other hand, it will always be obvious that the President had the stamina and b***s to see this thing through. He had to be thinking of Jimmy Carter. Buy the book and see for yourself.

B0070QSP5O|5.0|New CD, arrived promptly.  You just can't beat Leonard Cohen..one of the top poet/musicians of modern times.The songs on this CD are great...the song \\"Crazy to Love You\\" alone makes it worth the price of the album. Highly recommended.
B001CZJKS0|3.0|halloween 30th anniversary box set I was slightly dissappointed in. Because I thought I was getting all of the movies and it was missing 2&3. It gives you a blue ray verson of the 1st one. So you end up with two versons of the 1st one.
B007SSDBBM|5.0|Although I am not a Meg Ryan fan, I Love this movie!!!!  Hugh Jackman is the ultimate romantic fantasy, and the supporting characters are quirky and likeable. It is a wonderful romantic story, that I have watched three or four times and will watch again.  I was instantly sorry that I just rented it instead of buying it...next time I will buy it!!!!
031603441X|5.0|Life.  He knows how to live it.  My favourite post on FB was of Keith Richard saying, \\"I outlived Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston and Elvis... Betcha you didn't see that coming.\\"<br /><br />This book is sensational without being sensationalism.  His story is honest and clear-eyed, full of wonder, wit, wisdom and experience. He loves deeply, his devotion to his music is bone-deep.  His cynical eye as he watched the band he helped to create take a glimmer tour was patient.  I grew to honour this man in a way I never thought I would.  Hell, he was listening to Motown when I was!  He listened to Jackson Browne when I did!  And still created that dirty, lowdown, bluesy sound that was clearly his own.<br /><br />I read it through slowly, enjoying chapter by chapter, reaching the end far too soon.  It's probably my favourite 'new' book of this year.  I loved it.
B003THHIEM|5.0|What a great mystery series!!  I love the relationship between Castle and Beckett, and really like that the endings aren't predictable and boring!!! My brother and I agree that Kate Beckett, Stana Katic, is the most beautiful woman in any series on television!!!  Rick Castle, Nathan Fillion (\\"Firefly\\" and \\"Serenity\\"), is just plain delightful to watch. Castle's relationships with his daughter and mother have depth, humor and respectful tenderness that isn't cloying or pretentious.  The series is well rounded by Castles developing relationships with the rest of the NYPD team.  I liked this first season so well, I purchased it as well as the next three!!!

B008RTE09S|5.0|I watched this film for the first time a few months ago.  If you were alive during the sixties and watched stuff like \\"Batman, The Man From Uncle, The Monkeys and/or The Prisoner\\" then this film is for you.  It transports you back to the sixties.  The music part is great, but the film is groovy.  There is not a story per say, it is more like a journey and it is a very fun journey.<br /><br />Can't wait until I receive my blu-ray copy with all the special features.  And Beatles please re-release \\"Let it Be\\" in blu-ray very soon.
B0083GPDBO|3.0|I really wanted to like this film.  The trailers had me waiting in anticipation but, it really ended up a mess at the end and kind of a disappointment. Money not well spent.....
B00973CGXK|5.0|If you love The Killers, and you love Branden, you will love this cd...  My first album was actually Hot Fuss and I absolutely fell in love with them, then I got Day & Age and loved it like I love Dave Matthews... I'll listen to the cd and find 3 or 4 songs that I can't get enough of and the rest I just like.  But after a few listens my \\"favorite\\" songs will take a back seat to the others.  I judge a cd good if, after the 3rd or 4th listen, I am in love with every song on the cd.  When I discovered Sam's Town I was awestruck, I loved every single song on the first listen.  After listening to Day & Age and Hot Fuss (the more \\"indie rock\\" albums), I couldn't believe that they had such a different sound and I was in love!  So I bought Sawdust..  Love X 2!  Then I discovered they're Christmas music (generally I hate Christmas music, but Don't Shoot Me Santa?  Its great!) Then came the song they made for Yo Gabba Gabba... come on how the hell could you dislike a band that can be absolutely amazing at Country Western, Indie Rock, Pop, and a kids show and actually does a song as a benefit every year for Christmas?!!!  Then I discovered that Branden, Ronnie, and Mark had made they're own albums!  Branden's Flamingo is absolutely spectacular (surpassed in my album list only by Mumford and Sons), Big Talk is pretty cool (I love No Whiskey!, and I love Mark's voice! its Tom Petty'ish...  I couldn't wait till a new album! Battle Born is not in any way a disappointment. If you think it is a disappointment, it's because you have a narrow musical tolerance and, if so, then you shouldn't be a fan of The Killers!  Come on people lets show some support to the musicians who are actually capable of going outside the current \\"popular\\" radio crap!!!  I listen to the radio and I don't hear any of their best music and do you know what that tells me?  That means they are awesome...

B004EELXS6|5.0|The originak The French Connection is a very convincing action film which never has as much of a hint of letdown or a dull moment.  Set in the very gritty streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn, it gives us a view of the underbelly of narco-crime in the BIG APPLE back in the l960's!!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|what a boring game... you don't get that many coins and when you run out they want you to purchase more. furthermore most of the coins fall off the side of the belt and you only get 1 to 2 coins at a time... boring and pointless game!

B00005NC66|2.0|I guess those who enjoy movies from a box-seat of film-critiques find this movie superb, and I kind of get their points. It's a classic in its theme, content and emphasis on the story. But acting itself was centered on one person--the male protagonist. The female character was lacking in her skill as an actress. Also I find it annoying the way most French movies keep ranting about love. Give me a break! Love this, love that, yak yak, dreamy intellectualism and what not. I suggest you pass, unless this is a required movie for your Film 101 class.

B0074D3CAQ|4.0|First 3/4 started very strong then rambled a bit and ended average.<br />Very good story and very much worth the read. I don't wish to discourage you. I could hardly put this book down. But sometimes in life the outcome may not be what you expect based on the run up. It seemed as if the work was rushed to the finish but had to satisfy a page count.
B004EI2NM2|4.0|I don't really watch too many movies or TV these days but I finally decided I would watch Kill Bill tonight. After watching that movie for about 30 minutes, I felt it was overrated so once a commercial came up I flipped through the channels, and it was either Trailer Park Boys The Movie which I already saw 3x (great movie by the way) or this movie which was on The Sundance Channel which I'm not paying for but for some reason I'm getting it. Anyways, my TV said that the movie was adult-rated and I wouldn't be able to watch it without inputting the parental code. Now, I'm 25 years old, and I don't live in Wadiya so I don't know why there's a parental code in the first place, but being curious, I surmised that the password was 0000. I was correct.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie was almost ending but since the girls were hot I felt that it was my obligation to download the movie online and watch it anyways. I'm a dude, so take it for what it's worth, but I didn't watch the whole movie just parts of it. I'm not really sure what this movie was about but I felt that there should have been less chat and more action. It is for this reason that I had to dock one star for my review.<br /><br />From what I could tell, after fast-forwarding through the movie, the basic idea was that the lesbian chick (who had a nice body) and the straight Russian chick (who, in my opinion, was super hot) meet at a bar, are kind of tipsy, go back to a hotel room, and the straight chick is like, \\"No, I don't wanna, I'm straight\\" but after some minimal resistance from the lesbian chick is like, \\"Ah hell let's do this 'cuz hell we're in Rome\\" and then they scissor, talk about how it's ok for the straight girl to explore her female sexuality, how men are pigs and evil, seduce some Italian dude and then get offended after leading him on after he offers to pull his dong out, hate on men some more, and then finally the straight (I guess technically bicurious) woman is like, \\"Oh well this was just one awesome night but we must move on\\", and the lesbian chick is like, \\"But what?!? I, I loved you, and you're only person who I've ever truly loved\\" and then the straight girl is like, \\"No!\\" and then finally they have some bathtub sex and part ways.<br /><br />Other than that, I don't really know how much artistic or literary merit the story has though to be fair I'm not really the type to ask this. If you're the artistic type, you can probably appreciate this movie for the layers of hidden symbolism, metaphors, and literary terms that I haven't thought about since high school Engrish classes. I feel like this is the type of movie that chicks would like, and it's definitely better than that Notebook crap. Unfortunately, I think if you're a straight dude and you ask your friends who are girls to watch it with you, they would probably slap you. If not, then props to you bro.<br /><br />I think this is the type of movie that can appeal to both chicks and dudes. For chicks it has sentimental music that compels you to feel that the movie is sentimental, deep, and polished, and, of course, a story about taboo love in a stereotypically classy and romantic setting -- Europe, the land where men can get away with wearing purses by saying they're European. For dudes, lesbians and \\"bicurious\\" women, it has a hot naked Russian chick that makes Linsday Lohan look like Rosie O'Donnell, and for that reason I give this the Mango Seal of Approval®.
B00004WEJZ|5.0|This film is often omitted from the list of James Bond films because it was not a part of the Broccoli franchise. Sean Connery is still the epitome of James Bond! This is a \\"remake\\" of \\"Thunderball\\" (Sean Connery didn't like the \\"Thunderball\\" film as well as the other Bond films & felt i\\"Thunderball\\" could be made better). I have to admit that I like ALL of the Bond films (some better than the others) but I was glad to see Sean Connery as Bond one last time!

0525952926|5.0|To fully comprehend the story in Winter of the World you have to read the first in the trilogy, Fall of Giants.  Many readers fail to see how wonderfully Ken Follett has interconnected these five families with the brutal history of the 20th Century. I only wish that all three books had been released closer together.  I don't like waiting until 2014 to read the<br />last of the series.
0142419400|3.0|I am going to do the unthinkable and say that I have mixed feelings about this review. Ack. Go ahead and gasp and tell me how horrid I am. I'm ready for it. Now, don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this book; however, there were some things that keep me from proclaiming my undying love for it.<br /><br />First off, I'm one of those pesky people that want all lose ends wrapped up. So when I didn't find out what happened with the Dave and Amanda situation, it left me a little disappointed. Of course, this was such a minor element in the story that it didn't take away from the overall book, but still. There were a few other minor things, but they aren't really worth mentioning. Besides, I'm pretty sure it's just me. I honestly think it's my lack of interest in contemporary novels that kept me from proclaiming the utter and complete awesomeness of this book. For me to say that a contemporary read is phenomenal, slap yourself wonderful, it has to leave me speechless. Anna and the French Kiss did not leave me speechless, but it did make me smile at times.<br /><br />What did I love about this book? Many, many things! First off, the setting. OMG. The author did such an amazing job with the setting. It was like I was back in France. Every little detail was so wonderfully descriptive. I could picture everything in my mind as I read. Instant love. In fact, it made me wish I was catching a flight to Paris right now so I could relive everything Anna and Etienne experienced. The way the catacombs in Notre Dame were described was perfect. The author was spot on... the entire time. I think I can safely say that Stephanie Perkins did one of the best jobs EVER in setting the stage for a novel.<br /><br />She did an equally amazing job with the characters. Seriously, what is there not to adore about Anna and her crew? Anna was witty and self-conscious. She was great. I loved her and her raisin sized front tooth gap. Then there is Etienne St. Clair. Le sigh. Simply charming. I swear he makes me want to go around calling everyone \\"mate\\" and \\"bloke\\" while I wear knickers and stare at wankers. So much fun! He is a perfect book boyfriend. The remainder of the crew is also fun... very Joyluck Club-ish. They were a perfect complement to one another.<br /><br />I also think it's worth mentioning that there is a subtle theme in this story. It was a little unclear at first, but it became clear by the end of the story. I also loved that the English Literature teacher helped deliver this theme. Her lectures on translated works helped Anna discover a huge secret about herself, which translates beautifully to real life.<br /><br />This was a great contemporary read. I'm not a huge fan of contemporary works, but I did enjoy Anna and the French Kiss. It's a well-developed story with fantastic characters. A perfect beach read.kes me want to go around calling everyone \\"mate\\" and \\"bloke\\" while I wear knickers and stare at wankers. So much fun! He is a perfect book boyfriend.

B0095T3H2U|1.0|Don't waste your time with this one. The funniest parts were in the trailers and it doesn't get good until the last 20 minutes or so. It's a shame too because I like the actors and was looking forward to seeing it.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Love being able to access Pinterest whenever I want. Would give 5 stars if I wouldn't have so many issues with force-closing.
B008TRUDAS|1.0|very transparent and repetitious - the mother's illness appeared out of nowhere, not very well explained even though she was in the medical field, no mention of when it was detected, etc.  The poetry venue was silly.  The main male and female characters were one-dimentional.
0525953728|1.0|I remain an admirer of the military feat of arms that resulted in the death of Osama Bin Laden, even after having read this execrablely written book. While the operation itself deserved admiration and praise this opportunistic book does not. In fairness, the author, as a professional soldier, may have no pretensions to being a great writer and may have relied strongly on a \\"ghost\\".  But this must be close to being as bad as writing gets, even for a ghost.  There is even product placement- for example we are informed quite irrelevantly of the author's order of a medium Pepsi at a Taco Bell.  Save your money people - or make your donation directly to the charities said to benefit from the sales of this abominable book.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is riddled with repetitions (rolling eyes), cliches, and generally bad writing.  That is in addition to a topic that is presented in a salacious, rather than a thoughtful, studied way.  It is fairly obvious that the author is just trying to sell books, by being provocative.  That the general public seems to be eating this up says something very troubling about our times.  What ever happened to good literature?  Try reading Madame Bovary instead.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|While this book has a couple small places where it drags, the rest of the book more than makes up for it. Couldn't wait to finish and get the next.
B009329ZF2|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this movie.<br />There was plenty of action.<br />After watching what the aliens were doing to the Navy in the movie, you may not want to enlist at this time.<br />Every so often they'll make a good movie, this was one of them.

B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I liked this movie. I thought it was very well done and well plotted out. I think the storyline with all it's twists and turns would have been difficult and confusing if not done right. This film was interesting and imaginative. I watched it some time ago, but I'm glad I did.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest so being able to use it mobile-y has been wonderful! The only problem is that almost always on the first try it fails to open. The next try it almost always opens immediately so it is just a slight annoyance more than anything. I wouldn't stop using it for that reason because I love it so much!
B0019IB0II|5.0|A stoke of Insight was a marvelous piece of work.  It gives insight into the working of the brain and also the recovery of individuals with stokes.

B007U1FEJE|4.0|Once upon a time there was a world of feel good music. Literally - feel good music, about beaches, girls, sun & not having a care in the world. There wasn't a hint of sadness or dismal problems & even broken hearts weren't so bad because they never lasted. That world is gone. It's been gone for a long time.<br /><br />Thus, listening to the new reunion album by the remaining BB - excluding the ill Glen Campbell who originally replaced Brian Wilson on tour & played on Pet Sounds - is a strange experience. It is music out of time that sounds like it's 1962 all over again & the last few decades of anything-but-feel-good music has never happened, let alone Wilson never got ill & vanished for decades. But, at the same time it's strange hearing a band that sounds like this, because time has moved on & nobody expects a band of senior citizens to sound the same & sing the same feel good songs in the same way. 71 year olds don't sit at the beach or cruise down the highway.<br /><br />Yet, I can't think of another band that has returned after so long & turned in an album that so masterfully feels like so much of a flashback its scary. Wilson proves his amazing ear yet again, not that it was ever tarnished, as primary songwriter & producer. He's crafted a timeless, or out of time, lyrical walk through joyful emotions about the pleasures of love, God, music, beaches & just a general celebration of life. Yet, at times it feels emotionally forced & too light. The music might be lush but I've always believed that darker emotions come across more realistically, because nobody wants to feel angry so it's an emotion you struggle with as it cuts deep, while happiness you just let happen & float across ones life. But, yet, really, its hard to say if this honestly is a happy album, however it sounds. It may sound lush but the BB have never been a sad sounding band so Wilson isn't going to let them become that now. Maybe on one hand all the songs are nothing but joyful, maybe a bit too much at times, a bit too shallow, but yet its hard not to hear under the surface this as a dance with mortality for a band that many thought had died a long time ago & has seen the passing of some of its members. The final three songs form a masterpiece suite that puts all the negativity & sadness right up front. Wilson is going to let us enjoy this party for the most part & not weigh us down with worry. But, he knows the score & plays the game fair at the end. When he is going to be nostalgic it's going to be a tear-jerking farewell all the way. The album opens with \\"Think About The Days\\", a piano instrumental with some trademarked BB chorus vocalizations, that might be one of the saddest openings an album has ever had. This is Lou Reed Berlin sadness. It makes one tense for what is going to follow, for what one expects.<br /><br />The fact that what follows is a complete throwback belays that Wilson knew what the expectations would be & he is not going to dwell on his mortality just to meet those expectations. He ends the project with that mortality, exactly where it should come in the progression of the album. Obviously, musically, there is no doubt this is a Brian Wilson project. There's the multi-layered instruments & surprise arrangements of the Pet Sounds era, that only Wilson can create, not the sparse pop songs of earlier days or the radio friendly rock of the \\"Kokomo\\" era. With Pet Sounds Wilson made the instrumentation as important as the trademarkable \\"Help Me Rhonda\\" vocal arrangements had once been. In awhile it would have been nice to hear the pop early 60's pop band again.<br /><br />Pet Sounds might be Wilson's masterpiece, but a majority of hits come from the sparser sounding early days. In some ways, this sounds like Wilson picked right up where he left off with Smile. Perhaps the recent reworking of this lost project brought him back to where he was decades earlier, versus the sound that marked the solo albums after his return to performing. Wilson could never have constructed this album years ago. He may still be the performance shy stiff musician, but his voice is much looser & his comfort level has grown, though really, he's never going to be a great singer & remains a bit of a weight to listen to & watch. Really, he should stick to producing & not performing. One wonders if when Wilson started his return to music if he could have even have composed songs as cheerful as these? He had to purge his demons first & he surely has & now he can go back in time.<br /><br />Actually, it's amazing how vocally accurate & timeless the album is. Yes, there might low tones sung more often than there once was, but this feels like the BB in every way. So many musicians, like Rod Stewart & Heart, have released albums where the age in their voice was obvious & it was painful to hear them fall, but not here. But, its still really hard to listen to. It's so strange & alien sounding. The ear isn't used to music like this. Nobody even listens to the radio anymore, like they used to. But, then, when the BB debuted they were something different, Pet Sounds was the album that inspired Sgt Pepper & the BB have always been different. The trend continues. The songs here are short & to the point like songs haven't been in decades, sans guitar solos or anything that is seemingly part of modern music. Instrumental sections are like an orchestra not a rock band.<br /><br />How will Wilson follow this up? Surely there will not be another BB album, even though the band is now on tour. Wilson has released the complete Smile tapes, let alone re-recording the album. He's done everything musicians never do. He's recreated the past. Now that he brought the past back where does he go from here?<br /><br />There's another question that also lingers ... will folks listen to this album down the road or will it be forgotten? The fact that its getting the best reviews a BB album has gotten since 1977's Love You says a lot ... but, people don't listen to albums like they used to. It's now a world of singles not cohesive units. It's also now a place where music is accumulated faster than ever & albums quickly forgotten. There's really no place for a Smile or Pet Sounds anymore. People don't even listen to sounds & layers like they used to, just the rush they get off an initial listen. Is there a place for the BB anymore for the under 30 crowd who didn't grow up with them? Even their last hit \\"Kokomo\\" is a few generations past. The answer to these questions will show why God made the radio. Hopefully the DJ's will play it over & over as that's what it takes.<br /><br />It's not a hard album to enjoy, it's just hard to come to terms to. A few historic highlights of this album, the BB's twenty-ninth coinciding with their 50th anniversary, deserves mention. It's the first album to feature original material since 1992's Summer In Paradise & the first to be made since the 1998 death of Carl Wilson. It's also the first to feature guitarist David Marks since Little Deuce Coupe in 1963, who was 13 when he originally played with the BB moving over their first four albums. The title track reached number three on the Billboard charts & is their highest charting song since 1965, placing them second with longest span of top ten albums, beating the the Beatles by two years with Sinatra at fifty-two years of top ten albums & the Rolling Stones fourth place with forty-five years. It was also the first top ten studio album since 1976 & the highest studio album since 1971 in Englandn could never have constructed this album years ago. He may still be the performance shy stiff musician, but his voice is much looser & his comfort level has grown, though really, he's never going to be a great singer & remains a bit of a weight to listen to & watch.

B003VDZK8K|4.0|I like these guys and I think this album is on par with City of Evil.  The last track on the album is awesome, I can listen to it over and over.  I could do without some of the less intense songs, but those aren't bad either, just a preference I have when I listen to these guys.
B000002H97|4.0|I sometimes wonder if people still listen to this album like they once did. When it first came out, I remember well, you couldn't get away from it. I even had my mother listening. But, so many years, tours, bandmates, controversies & albums later there's become so many shades of Metallica that one can't just randomly choose an album & feel as satisfied as ever. There's too many choices. Do you put on the Cliff Burton crunch era climaxing with Master Of Puppets that made the thrash mold forever? Do you turn to the Load or St. Anger albums of the sparse sounds of apocalypse era? Or, do you go for the current Death Magnetic stuff ... or even the poetic abomination Lulu? Or, do you go for the chart-topping breakthrough self-titled album, come to be known as The Black Album, that turned so many of us to the band initially ... including myself, though I'd seen \\"One\\" on MTV but didn't know the band beyond that single epic durge from the previous album. It's the sign of a band that's continued to grow that an answer doesn't come quickly. The problem is, for many of us, there's no album quite like The Black Album in the Metallica catalog. The progressive metal that came before was successfully trimmed away, here the songs are just a bit shorter & a bit tighter, while after came some directions that don't rate too high generally with a majority of fans & critics. This album was a climactic moment, musically & career-wise, & could not be repeated. Thus, it leaves us in a lurch. There is no questioning why it was successful or remains a career highlight ... I mean, the echoing drums & sparse riffing of opener \\"Enter Sandman\\" still is as powerful as ever, while how can one not headbang & scream along to \\"Sad But True\\"? But, does it represent Metallica now in the long term? Did it then? It's an important stepping stone in their musical growth, but what does it say about the band? It's certainly the album I'll recommend to someone young who doesn't know Metallica & I feel may not be a big metal fan. Though, is it even the best Metallica album? I know I tend to go to Master Of Puppets & rarely hit the post Black Album outings, if at all. But, am I giving new fans the best introduction to the band? In many ways, absolutely. At its best the album is as strong as one could ask from a thrash band, as sparse, chunky, heavy, with pretty much any musical nuance & mood one might want. The songs are more straight forward than what Metallica was doing, but just a touch of experimenting remains (i.e. \\"Nothing Else Matters\\"). Bands have gone faster, more complicated, sparser, blacker, angrier certainly, but there is magic in this album. There's a few songs I'd remove on the later half that are a bit imitative, but its a minor qualm. Certainly, the album churns out more variety over a couple songs than many bands do over an entire release. Though, really, this might not be one of the best thrash albums. Some may say that its really not thrash. I know, I loved it but didn't consider myself a thrash fan until I got into Megadeth. But, I think one can say that this might be the best mainstream thrash album. The greater thrash albums by Megadeth, Testament, Pantera, Anthrax or whoever never had the commercial success upon release like this album, except maybe Megadeth's Countdown To Extinction but that wasn't as big as this Metallica moment. This point offers another question ... none of which really can be answered & I'm not trying. As Metallica has moved beyond the album into other territories, so have other bands. Maybe more than ever the Metallica versus Megadeth argument rages. Are Metallica really the top thrash band? Ignoring their live show which is certainly one of the best to answer that question. I tend to be a Megadeth fan, I'll confess. The lyrics, Dave's voice, the playing, the lyrics, everything gets me on a level Metallica doesn't. Megadeth's worst album invites me & hits me more than Metallica's worst, excluding Lulu. But, can one even compare these peers as they really are quite different. Metallica is controlled where Megadeth is raw, Megadeth is also far more angrier a lot more of the time, let alone seemingly more socially conscious. Plus, there's two guitarists versus one. I can clearly remember when this album landed & the uproar it caused. It was like a treasure everyone owned & yet it still remained valuable. Today, looking back, does a new fan still have the same view of the album who wasn't there, still sucking up the music with as much praise & enjoyment as my generation did? As someone once said to me, anyone can enjoy the Beatles, but if you weren't there you'll never really appreciate or know their music. Is that accurate? I've always been a Rolling Stones fan ... so what do I know?e these peers as they really are quite different.

B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book is a great mix of science and storey. It makes one think about why we really do what we do. It won't tell you how to louder weight or stop smoking, but it will give you a nice solid understanding of why we keep eating and smoking in the first place.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very addictive!  Great game.. recommend to all my friends and everyone else.Come build a village..you<br />will enjoy all the coins. you can collect.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I've read all the Reacher books and enjoyed them all, most of them rate highly on my list of best reads ever. BUT (you knew it was coming didn't you) this one isn't the best of them in my opinion. The first quarter of the book left me wondering when Reacher was actually going to become Reacher.<br /><br />In the end all the things I've come to love about Lee Child's writing came out, but it took a long time to get there. Yep, I'll read it again, but not for a long time.<br /><br />Would I recommend it - yes I would but not as the first Reacher book for someone new to the series. It's good but not great.<br /><br />And with regards Tom Cruise as Reacher, I totally agree with all the other comments; no doubt he's a great actor but I can't see him as Reacher. Having said that, I'll definitely go and watch it - looking forward to seeing how they carry across the Lee Child writing style to a movie.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|This is the first military book I've read and while I knew I was interested in the content I was surprised at just how much it grabbed me... could not put the book down.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Oscar Wilde is phenomenal at taking your mind and all its components, rearranging them and laying them back out in an entirely different order. There's a lot to be learned from Dorian Gray, I promise he's well worth your time.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I really liked this book.  A very easy read but a lot of twists and turns.  I may see the movie now...
B008D28HYS|5.0|Both CrossMe and CrossMe Color are excellent games that are similar to Sudoku for needing to logically figure out how to complete the puzzle.  CrossMe Color adds a new twist with color-based clues that makes some of the logical reasoning even more complicated than the original CrossMe.  One caution though, it is very difficult to play the larger maps on a smaller smartphone screen, so make sure that you have a tablet to play this game.
B000002UAU|5.0|Best Beatle album. The cd was and is amazing. One of the best ever. Flawless. Listen to it all the time.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|With the exception of a very VERY few scenes you would think they went back in time with a HD camera.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book starts slow but then it picks up. The use of diary helps to keep the reader entertained and engaged for a while, but feels somewhat overstretched. Certain twists of the plot don't feel right and don't fit the characters' personalities. However, the overall quality of writing is quite satisfactory, and the analysis of the modern family dynamic was very interesting.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Construction of the bag is great, though I prefer messenger-style bags to carry my camera equipment. I got this as part of a promo deal with my camera. It's better for long travel than for actual quick street shooting, but works as intended. I would buy this if I was looking for a backpack-style bag. If that is what you want, don't hesitate to buy.
0061251321|5.0|A must read for any manager or executive looking to build an organizational culture for long term success.<br />As Peter Drucker wrote - \\" Culture eats strategy for breakfast \\" !  Good read with good case studies and lessons learned.
B0098VXBIA|2.0|Predictable and reinforces my dislike for JLo and Diaz as actresses. Dennis Quaid, Brooklyn Decker, Elizabeth Banks, and the british girl are funny in it. Sad to see what's become of Chris Rock.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really liked the first 3/4 of this book.  It was original and interesting.  The end left a little to be desired.  It seemed rushed and not in keeping with the rest of the book
B001POXA02|5.0|Good quality - as expected. After having bought my first Seiko Kinetic in 1995 (still in function) I wanted a new one.
0060555661|5.0|This is the best book on ivesting, have read it multiple times.  Security Analysis is better in that it covers more of the technical/quantitative aspects of security analysis.  But The Intelligent Investor summarizes security analysis in a more readable(qualitative)fashion.  Ironically many of Graham's insights have been repeated since the last writing.  And Jason Zweig's comments help explain.

B006OAB3ME|4.0|OK Paul McCartney is not the first \\"rock and roller\\" to go all American Songbook on us. He and his Liverpool band used to drag out the show tunes and pub sing-alongs (SEE: Sheik of Araby, or 'Til There Was You, or Maggie Mae). But it took the truly gifted voice and respectful sensibilities of Linda Ronstadt and Nelson Riddle Orchestra to weld influences into a cohesive set of music that Linda's mom and dad (and mine) could recognize as \\"real\\" music. Linda set the standard for old rockers trying to move a few units by mining the \\"real\\" music of a generation or two before their own time of relevance. Bravo to her.<br /><br />Now comes the richest front man in our time with a set list of songs which were generally introduced to him by his own father. Also included are a couple of chestnuts Paul's producer/arranger pulled out of his hat. Then for real value to the customer, our hero wrote two new songs in this genre's mood and used his new wife for muse. The old boy succeeds, and while generally \\"nothing exceeds like excess\\", this collection finds Paul in fine voice, aging like a really good wine that you have indulged in for years. The songs are fun, pleasurable, well executed, and fairly memorable. Diana Krall and her band are perfect. The guest stars do not over-shadow or intrude, and the arrangements are respectful without sounding stodgy.<br /><br />I first encountered this new set of tunes when McCartney appeared on the Grammys and performed one of his originals from this collection. The new recording was to be available for Valentine's Day, which was nearly co-occurent with the Grammys. His performance at the Grammys was creditable, but what was really interesting was the never overtly acknowledged \\"elephant in the room\\" power of \\"Paul\\". The Grammy's are all about honoring and recognizing the performers, performances, and songs of the recent past, and here is Paul McCartney being given air time to promote his newest endeavor and actually perform a new song.<br /><br />I resisted purchasing the new set based solely upon this over-the-top product placement advertisement within the context of a \\"reality\\" awards program. Then a couple of weeks ago, PBS presented a live in the studio presentation/performance of the \\"Kisses on the Bottom\\" set list, with Diana Krall and her band, string players, Stevie Wonder, Eric Clapton, and Joe Walsh (where did he come from?). My wife, who is currently a \\"wounded bird\\" professional musician, and I watched the PBS show and were impressed. She is the Linda Ronstadt as songstress fan (I enjoy LR in that mode, but prefer her singing in other genres.)<br /><br />Long story shorter, I bought my wife the Kisses on the Bottom CD and we find it very enjoyable living room, dining room, bedtime, and even drive music. It can really de-stress a long ride to and from medical visits. McCartney now joins Ronstadt with the best sets of musical ambling through songs of earlier ages and times. If you like this sort of thing, then this recording can be obtained with confidence. If such fare is too ironic for you, then pass on it. It is not absolutely essential for your Paul collection.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|So ive owned these for about a year now, the sound quality that you get from these for the price you pay is worth it, i love the fucntions and options they give me on the volume panel, theyre light weight, but that is countered by the very cheaply done earpads in the headset, my ears are of normal size and my ears start hurting within 45 min of use, within 1hr 30 min i have a headache like no other, the mic, broke off from the left earpiece, I superglued it back into the plastic that this headset is made out of(reason why its so light). I dont really have too much else to say, other than these have been retired and i bought a new headset from another company. Hope this helps the average joe out there looking for a real review.

B005D0RDKW|3.0|I bought this Rush DVD because they play the entire \\"Moving Pictures\\" album! I have every other Rush DVD and have to say that Geddy's voice on this DVD just sucks! Maybe the long tour got to him, maybe he was sick, maybe he's getting old??<br />  The Band played great as usual, the camera angles were great, over all the whole DVD was excellent but for Geddy's vocals. They were really bad to OK throughout the DVD. He often shouted instead of sang. Real shame too as I love Moving Pictures and hope they do another DVD and play it though again but that prob wont happen.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I found this book very interesting, not too many details but in general it was giving clear and exact picture of this operation.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|I have to admit, I did really like this movie.It is up there with great action movies like BatMan Begins and Iron Man.Even though its not as good as The Dark Knight, I will say it was a whole lot better than the Cupcake Avengers Movie.My only problem with the movie is Kick-Ass himself.I think the writers should have used Kick-Ass in the first part of the movie-like they did, then let Hit-Girl and her story become fully the second part of the movie.It would have set up a sequel alot better.To me the Kick-Ass character was just in the way during the Hit-Girl action scenes.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|This was SUCH a beautiful story and I am completely in love with it. John Carter is a man out of place and time (and planet) who doesn't want to be the hero. In the end he does and finally figures out where he belongs.  The special effects and action are wonderful and I found myself cheering for John the entire time.  There are some comical moments that tie in with the story.  I truly enjoyed this movie and will definitely own it once it becomes available.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|After hearing so many good things about this movie, I was a little surprised to see the poor reviews posted on Amazon.  Perhaps these reviews termpered my expectations as I really wound up enjoying this movie.  I think the most important part of a good sci fi movie is to transport you to another world.  This film definitely does that and the visuals are stunning.  I also thought the story line was very good.  Did not worry too much about how this movie tied into the original Alien.  To me they were two different movies with some overlapping elements.  Anyways I missed this in the theatre so hats off to Amazon for bringing this to streaming 3 weeks before the DVD release and at an excellent price to boot.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|the update for the power up ain't working for me. uninstalled 3 times still doesn't get the update please fix
B004YM6JI2|5.0|the show is still great! Dick is really great! nice casting! still sticking to lore and bible crap so even though the primary series storyline ended a couple seasons ago being able to continue it without skipping a beat and still incorporating previous events makes it a compete mystery how this show doesn't actually get more attention that it does. modern family, glee, MTV and E shows and \\"celebrities\\" are somehow in our weekly tv news lexicon, but not supernatural. its amazing what flys and what flies under the radar.

1933492910|5.0|I am a big fan of conceptual art, and I have to give Terryl Whitlatch much of the credit for that.  I first purchased her book [[ASIN:0811847365 The Wildlife of Star Wars: A Field Guide]] back when it first came out and I was blown away by the detailed and thoughtful creature designs.  Say what you will about the prequels (and I will say that overall they were not that good), but I can find no fault with the many artists who worked on the design of the films - Whitlatch did much of the creature work for the first film, and so I was somewhat familiar with a few of her designs even before purchasing that book.<br /><br />I also bought her book [[ASIN:0743225007 The Katurran Odyssey]] a few years ago - I am sure it was one of the bargain books at Barnes and Nobles or Borders - again the artwork was terrific, although it was focused more on actual animals, some extinct some extant.  I was extremely excited when I read that Whitlatch was coming out with a new book of conceptual artwork, so you can bet that I pre-ordered it as soon as I could.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Chapter Two (Animals Imagined) is clearly my favorite part of the book.  Her ungulate/ ape hybrids were particularly interesting.  I also loved her ogres and the Pre-Tracker (which I believe was created for a class she teaches: [...]  Overall, the book is great - my hardcover edition is printed on high-quality paper and I know it's something I will enjoy for years.<br /><br />If you are interested in this type of creature design, I would also recommend: [[ASIN:B005ZOLGTA The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island (King Kong)]], [[ASIN:1606600222 Dinotopia: A Land Apart from Time -- 20th Anniversary Edition (Calla Editions)]], [[ASIN:B005MWMSM4 Worlds: A Mission of Discovery]], [[ASIN:1781161097 Prometheus: The Art of the Film]], [[ASIN:0894809822 Expedition: Being an Account in Words and Artwork of the A.D. 2358 Voyage to Darwin IV]], and these books by Dougal Dixon - [[ASIN:0312194331 After Man: A Zoology of the Future]] and [[ASIN:0449904423 The New Dinosaurs: An Alternative Evolution]].fter Man: A Zoology of the Future]] and [[ASIN:0449904423 The New Dinosaurs: An Alternative Evolution]].

B001MSMULG|4.0|Silva sticks to a theme he seems to know well with charaters that have been interesting to his readers.  As a result, some of the suspense is lost.  However, it was enjoyable and kept me turning the pages when I probably should have been doing something else.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|I enjoyed this book for the most part, but it left me feeling like there was more to the story that was not told.  The idea that 2 families could be so close and then be so suddenly torn apart seemed unbelievable to me. I also wished there were more details regarding Emily's storyline because I found it hard to understand why she was suicidal.  The story was a good idea, it just fell a little short for me to rate it any higher.

B007SGM084|2.0|I thought this might be something different from what I normally read and there was promise before it sunk into a soppy romance.  I did not like the character of Anastasia at all.  Live and learn I guess.  If I had to read one more \\"I love you Ana\\"  \\"Oh Christian\\" I would go ballistic.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book gives somewhat of an insight into the training the Seals go through.  Without proper intelligence, verified, this operation would never have come about.

B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy is in my top 5 list of favorite books! I am some what of a picky reader. If I can put the book down with ease and do something else, it's likely I won't pick it back up any time soon. With \\"Catching Fire\\", I never wanted to put it down or stop reading it! It kept me glued to it from the beginning to the end.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I got the first game from Fire Maple (The Mystery at Grizzly Manor or something like that) as the free app of the day a good long while ago. I loved it, it's a really entertaining game, but for someone who had zero experience with a hidden object game, it was extremely difficult to navigate and I had to get a lot of help from the internet to complete it.<br /><br />This game was MUCH easier to navigate. There's a map, so when you're thinking to yourself, \\"I totally know where that goes, but I cannot for my life remember how to get there....\\" you can get a trigger. Yes, you still have to GET THERE on your own (wouldn't that just defeat the purpose?), but you can get a reminder as to where it is.<br /><br />Additionally, the journal is a genius addition. After I completed this game (Lost City) I went back and played the first one, and found that the lack of journal was a real challenge, which made me appreciate the one in Lost City that much more. You get codes and carry them around with you, which when they're five, six, ten screens apart is really, really great.<br /><br />The graphics are stunning. As a result of stunning graphics and also extended screen-on time, this game will chomp your battery right up. NO fault of the game, just a matter of fact.<br /><br />I definitely recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As I said with the review about \\"Catching Fire\\", this series is in my Top 5 List of all time favorite books. I love it when a book keeps me hooked from the beginning to end, and so much so that I have to immediately start reading the next book, if it is a series. This series did just that! I couldn't put the books down at all. I must say I read each book in just over a day, and am sad that it is over. They all were just so well written. I must add that I am very, very pleased with how \\"Mockingjay\\" ends!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Reminds me of the old Mario! :) No issues yet! I've just started playing it and I'm hooked! Can not say anymore
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I never EVER give books 5 stars, but the reason I gave 5 stars tot his book is because I laughed out loud as many times as I cried. Usually a book will dominate in one thing, sadness, angst, humor... not this one! This book was well rounded with emotion and I loved it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|my friends have minecraft and they never let me play and i got this and i love it. its so creative you have to.know some crafting ideas and its really amazing i highly recommend this to somebody that wants to play a fun game and kill some time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is super fun and addictive. Its a great way to kill time. Its like having a carnival in your hands.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I didn't know this group before I got a free $5 mp3 credit for Amazon and saw the album was only $5. Wow! What a great deal. The songs on album range from dub to 80's-Flock of Seagulls-type music. It's amazing because even though it ranges over that large of genres, the music is still fantastic. They use very catchy rhythms and leads to catch my attention. Then the lyrics keep me coming back as its not cookie-cutter lyrics, but something deeper. Great album. If you are willing to try new, definitely try this album and band!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is fun and you need patience I think because you have to wait for the coins.  I really love this game
B008XG1X18|3.0|The app does act a little crazy sometimes, not wanting to open. Gotta make lemonade out of lemons if you love pinterest like I do.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|too slow. the game needs to speed up. there is also a lag when u release some coins. need to release the coins at a faster speed.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Read this book for a book club.  The book started out a little intriguing, then started to become ok.  Once you hit the midpoint it definitely became a must read.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer, if you like suspense get the book and read.  If you like your endings neatly tied up with a bow.  Stop and don't buy.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|I've given a 5 star rating because the product works as described/expected.  It arrived timely and is easy to use.<br /><br />Here is how I got the best results.<br />1. Score the bottle lightly.<br />2. Place the bottle into boiling water (just above the score line) for 10-15 seconds until the glass gets good and hot.<br />3. Place the bottle into a large bowl containing ice and water (5-10 seconds)<br />4. Repeat step 2 & 3 until the glass separates<br /><br />Works like magic! :)
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|This movie was a fun sci-fi journey to another world. The ideas are unique in the telling and it's the best CGI i've seen to date. There are a couple weak plot points, but the film is for fun and it does a great job. Very epic, very cool. If you like StarWars you'd probably like this film.
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you love looking at things like shoes or clothes or like finding stuff to do on those bored days, look no further! This is the app for you. Look at millions of different things in lightning fast speed on your tablet! I am so glad I got this!
B008BIN9EW|1.0|Seems a lot of people who purchased this and had it work can no longer access the program because the Authors and Amazon only want it to work on Kindle Fire.  If we own the app and it does actually work on our device then it is pretty bad that Amazon no loonger allows you to download to the device of your choice.  Very bad.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I loved this book and had a hard time putting it down!  Great to read about the writer's experiences especially the taking down of Osama.  I hope the Pentagon doesn't take legal action against the writer and after reading the book there was nothing top secret revealed.
B004NOCCEG|2.0|As a movie, it was fine in the Moore tradition of bombastic populism, trying to get American Public's attentions to the issues of our times.<br /><br />As a financial analysis, the film omitted various facts and facts are where the devil of the argument lay. For example, the filmmaker blames Lehman Brother's executives for making over $1 billion dollar in compensation, but I want to add that their compensation was based against Stock options for future stock purchases. Almost 30% of Lehman Brother's stock was owned by their employees, so it is disingenuous to say Lehman people robbed the world, when they lost their life savings, too. If people do not know by now, Lehman's stock have no value.<br /><br />For a call to arms, I agree that President Obama has not done enough to fix the regulatory issues. However, again, the devil is in the details. President Obama probably already knows this truth, so let me add this truth to average American, there is no way to enforce \\"conflict of interest\\" any longer. Every investment, every checking account, and every dollar printed by the US government is linked to our financial industry. Counter party contracts, US government ownership, US Federal Reserve policies, and other areas have made this a dangerous battle against ourselves.<br /><br />The movie-maker doesn't get that President Obama is forced to deal with the hand that he was given with the tangled system. Liberal outrage is misplaced and if you do attempt what Matt Damon is proposing with his narration, you will have to bankrupt the US for a fresh start, raising unemployment, not lowering it.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|this game is worth 3dollars. the phicices in this game is so realistic. Also I love the hd in this game.
B008Y7R1LM|5.0|I'm not sure when a conspiracy \\"theory\\" ceases to become just theory and are taken seriously, but JFK is one of those movies which present actual information which should remove any doubts any reasonable person would have about this murder of one of America's most popular presidents.  JFK wasn't my favorite president, but didn't deserve to be murdered in office.  This is the movie of the only trial (except for the 2000? senate investigation) to actually pronounce that this \\"theory\\" had a basis in fact.  The acting, scripting, and photography are good examples of what Hollywood can do when it tries!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was similar to 50 but yet different.  The story was wonderful to the extent it was hard to put down.  I am anxiously awaiting the next book.  For those who say it is copy of 50 you obviously didnt read much of it!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|\\"Bones Are Forever,\\" is another great Temperance Brennan who-done-it. Kahty Reichs writing style just gets better with each book. Since he inception of the \\"Bones\\" television series its been fun watching the young Bones and then reading the more mature Bones who aside from sharing a nickname are nothing alike. Enjoy a great read, and add Kathy Reichs to your \\"friends list\\" of good authors and read her books.[[ASIN:1439102430 Bones Are Forever: A Novel (Temperance Brennan)]]
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I understand they want us to pay for more coins but the regen speed is way too slow for continued play. other than that its a fun little time waster
B007PTJOV0|5.0|unexplanebly awesome this game is the total bomb love it so much kid friendly it is a great. billing game
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my 15 yr old daughter and her best friend.  I am so glad I read it.  It should be on every middle/high school reading list.  I thought the subject was honestly covered in a way that the story could have happened in any decade - making it relevant to a wide range of readers.
B0092SQBJA|4.0|Don't get me wrong, alot of the songs were good, but none stood out as several did in Tourist History. My favorite of the album is Sun, which does not hail to half of the pieces on Tourist History. It was good but not up to par for this group. Maybe next time, I'm looking forward to it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this was a great game!  very fun and challenging at times.  I really ebjoyed it and can not wait to get started on the second mystery!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Thought this game was fun and easy at first. As you move up in levels it gets super challenging and addictive.
B009329Y30|5.0|this is a heart rendering love story that anyone with an ounce romance can definitely get into. This is a DO NOT miss movie!!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|this is like the old intellivision game snafu..the original...the intellivision one was superior and much more complex...its ok but not great.....
0385344333|2.0|I've loved all the previous Reacher novels but this one needs help. Seems like Lee Child just ran out of ideas. The title doesn't even fit really well. Plot not well thought out and the ending was anti-climatic.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Great product but you can only go so far before you have to purchase the whole game.  Why claim free if not true?  But it's a fun game and have it on my computer and it keeps going and going.  But not so with the app.  But this has nothing to do with amazon - love amazon.  Great prices and great products.  It's the game company that disappoints you.
B0042UEU8M|5.0|Ofcourse the movie is not as awesome as the book but it is just as entertaining. Its confusing at times during the movie but as time goes by it all begins to make sence. Its hearbreaking during the sad parts. The movie actually made me cry. I loved it. Its a must see.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app you can hear rock coutry pop in no time. If I were u I would get this app becasuse you can hear any Doria.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|It took the person on the other end of the competition forever to finish up their drawing. That made me wonder if there was anybody at all or if i was playing on my own.
030758836X|4.0|In Gillian Flynn's \\"Gone Girl\\", there are so many unexpected twists and turns. Just when you think you are starting to figure out what's going on, WHAM! Something happens and completely de-rails your thought process.<br />The setting of the story takes place in Missouri. Amy and Nick were both successful writers that were plagued by the failing economy. They both get fired from their jobs and end up being forced to abandon their comfortable lifestyles in New York. As a young married couple, it's definitely a change from what they were used to. They give up their posh want-for-nothing lives and trade it in for a rental property in a little town.<br />Each character brings a lot to the table with each one being half of a fragmented marriage. It is a devious tale of a problem filled situation followed by being led down a destructive path, being pushed off of a cliff and dragged through mud!  I wanted to flip through the pages and get to the end because I needed to know what the result would be. My poor heart couldn't take such pressure! You'll find yourself holding your breath and/or forgetting how to breathe quite often.<br />Layers of Nick and Amy's sick twisted marriage are revealed with each page that is turned. It is a quickly paced book that you can't put down. Even if you find the courage and strength to do so, you'll keep thinking about it even when you're not reading. I stayed up in the wee hours of the night willing myself to quit reading, over and over again.<br />Amy disappears on their 5th wedding anniversary. This occurs at a time within their marriage where there is instability, lies, and deceit. The story is narrated by Nick each day of her disappearance  in the form of \\"One day gone, Two days gone, Three days gone\\"...and so on. Amy speaks through seven years worth of chronological diary entries.<br />It all explodes when Nick receives a call from his neighbor telling him that his front door is wide open. Nick comes home to find the living room is disarray and most importantly, his wife is gone. He calls the police and an investigation begins. The \\"crime\\" scene shows evidence of a struggle, large amount of blood, and an overturned ottoman. From the beginning, the number one suspect is...YEP, YOU GUESSED CORRECTLY. IT'S NICK. He has no alibi for where he was when she disappeared and is thrown under the media's scrutiny.<br />By the half-way point of the book, the central mystery is solved. Flynn explains what has occurred to Amy. What happens next? YOU'LL NEVER GUESS!<br />I went back and forth with mixed emotions throughout the story and it unraveled in ways I couldn't begin to prepare myself for. Half of the time, I couldn't decide who was most guilty. Nick or Amy? The phrase \\"Things are never truly the way they seem\\" take on a whole new meaning and could actually be an alternate title for this book. It is indubitably mind pleasing and worth every minute spent invested in its pages.

B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I really liked this book, I am looking forward to the main character (Travis) point of view 'Walking Disaster' out next year. The rumors are true, its a fun read.
0385344333|5.0|I have read some of the other negative reviews and I have to disagree, Lee Child again delivers a great story.<br /><br />I have read every word that Child has published, or at least what I know of, and \\"A Wanted Man\\" reminded me of the Reacher from the first book in the series, \\"The Killing Floor\\". In both of these books we see a more vulnerable side to the character. Having listening to it in audio form, I really enjoyed Dick Hill's performance. It had to be tuff being Reacher with a broken nose and it really added to the book.<br /><br />If you are new to Lee Child's work, I would not recommend this be the first read of the series, it is a departure from his usual formula. But as an avid fan I am glad that Child took a chance and mixed it up a little. Not every story has to be epic to be good
B000NI8F5G|5.0|Dated, but still fun. Gene Kelly is a pleasure to watch.  He is a great dancer and very charming. The rest of the cast is good too.
034580404X|5.0|My journey began months ago as friends read this book and said how great it was, not me - I was not interested.  Then I had a change of heart, after all their rave reviews I decided that I had to read it.  I began reading book one on a Tuesday evening after work.  I was sucked in immediately - I stayed up all night reading, unable to find a chapter that I could stop at for the night.  Suddenly it is time to get up for work and part of me nearly called in sick to finish it and start book two.  But off to work I went.  Got home and immediately started reading again; without turning on tv or starting dinner - I sat next to the table lamp and read.  Started book 2 on Wednesday evening and again stayed up way to late, unable to put it down.  I had not yet gotten book 3 from a co-worker to dive into.  On Thursday I stopped by a book store and picked it up.  Knowing I could not manage to finish book 2 without immediately starting book 3.  Book 3 was started Thursday night and again - after about 2 hours of sleep I headed into work.  Finishing the series Friday evening; after getting a measly 10 hours of sleep all week long.<br /><br />Don't let this book fool you, although it is erotic and does offer some dark excitement; it is the story that wins you over.  The entire series is a build up to the end.  The sex is just part of the journey.  It starts off exciting,  I found my self Ana's own cheerleader, often giggling out loud at parts.  Then as the build up continues into book 3, you hit the apex of the story - the confession.  It brought me to tears.  In the book there are the pleasure lessons - Christian bringing Ana so close, but pulling away - prolonging the experience; this book's story reads the same.  Then the 3rd book offers a little insight at the end.  You have spent the entire book figuring out Christian; and then the recap of the first encounter - from Christian's point of view is there.  It is the exact opposite of what you thought and it makes the book so much more.<br /><br />I have never read a book/series that affected me as much.  I was certain I would not like these books - was certain I would not read them.  I was completely wrong about them.  I had borrowed books 1 & 2, buying book 3.  I am buying books 1 & 2 so that I can read them again in the future - and although the movies are never as good as the books - I will be seeing this when released.<br /><br />If you have never read anything erotic; this is a good book to start with - if you are on the fence; read it.  It is not porn and it is not smut.  It is a wonderful love story full of twists and little surprises that leave you longing for your own Christian.  If you grasp the story beyond the sex you will be taken far greater than just a few sexy scenes.  I felt completely spent after these books were finished - it was a very moving experience.h more.<br /><br />I have never read a book/series that affected me as much.

B00933JL0A|5.0|This is truly the BEST app I have ever had on my Kindle Fire, it's fun, addicting and interesting.  The tax rate, the production chains, etc.  make this game amazing.  I just downloaded it last night and I'm hooked.  There's a premium currency called 'Prestige' that you can earn.  No purchase necessary!  There are many places to establish your town.  Pro Tip: Make lots of fabric and sell mmost of it.  Even though I won't be getting the Premium Version, I strongly recommend it because: 1. It's not expensive. 2.  It's totally worth it.  3.  it's that good.  Great work, Handy Games.
0345529057|5.0|I'm glad I live in Florida, because we get a really long beach season and this series is a giant \\"beach-read\\"  It is compelling, in large part due to the structure of each chapter being devoted to a single character's involvement in the overall plot.  The varied characters make the reading stay fresh, and the tensions make for a real page-turner.  I am on Book 2 and turning pages every chance I get.  I never saw the HBO series and I'm just as glad that I didn't -- maybe later I will try to find a re-run to compare it.
0571238343|5.0|Great book for those interested in animation. We had checked it out of the library, and it was such a good book that we decided to buy it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|At first I wasn't able to get into it, I kept reading it where I wasn't able to put it down.  When I finished the book I wanted more, to find out it's not out yet, can't wait

B0089BSOPA|1.0|Scream Factory drops the ball (pumpkin?) on a long-awaited special edition of Halloween II. The following is a review of the DVD version of Halloween II Collector's Edition released by Scream Factory.<br /><br />The main reason of this review is to further point out (as a previous reviewer has done) this product's severe audio botch-up on the theatrical version's main audio track. For starters, the audio info described on the back of the slipcase as well as the back cover art is erroneous.  It is not 5.1, but rather something else, which is displayed by my DVD player as 2.0.  Be that as it may, this 2.0 track is disastrous on all fronts.  Loud noises, e.g. gunshots and explosions sound terribly off and unnatural.  Vehicles driving into and out of frame sound as if the soundtrack was replaced by jet airliners taking off.  Two such instances of this are when the two women drive off in the Mustang and the ambulance drives off at the end.  Most inexcusable however, is that the film's musical score sounds altered in the worst way.  It hasn't been replaced, but somehow tweaked to an unacceptable incarnation.  I was not able to bear listening to any significant portion of this audio track while watching the film (neither will anyone else, I imagine).  The bizarre thing is that the audio track played in the background during both commentaries appears to be free from the aforementioned problems.  Why Scream Factory could not use this track as the main track is anybody's guess.<br /><br />The rest of the package is not without merit however as the video quality is excellent as is the documentary and featurette revisiting shooting locations.  A major plus is the inclusion of the TV version on Disc 2 (the audio track here is fine) featuring the addition of many deleted scenes, most of which can be found on Disc 1 as separate entities with an optional commentary track.  Rounding things out are two decent commentary tracks, a trailer, TV and radio spots, and a still gallery.<br /><br />Fans of this movie will not be able to part with the 2001 Universal DVD release of this movie since this is what will be used to actually watch and enjoy the movie for all subsequent viewings.  Because the audio track on Scream Factory's disc is unlistenable for the entire run of the movie (due to the crucial musical score being distorted and loud noises sounding off unnaturally), I am unable to rate this product higher than one star since the main feature (the movie itself) is unpresentable.  We waited 10-plus years for a special edition of this movie to come out and we are presented with a film whose audio is unbearable and to some extent unrecognizable to sit through.  The supplemental material exceeds expectations but in the end is attached to a real stinker of a maligned main feature.  Hence this product is now placed on the same pedestal as the problematic Code Red release of Madman: terrific to watch the supplements, inexcusable to watch the actual movie.<br /><br />Never, under any circumstance, sell off or part with a DVD just because a future special edition DVD is in the works.  Always wait until you have the new edition in your hands and you have had sufficient time to watch and listen to it in full before deciding to let go of previous editions.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/27/2012: I too have received a replacement disc for Disc 1, and after a thorough listening have determined that the audio all the way through is up to par for 2.0 stereo.  There is good separation in the left and right channels as opposed to the original faulty disc that had an overamplified mono sound with considerable flanger effect.  The replacement disc is flanger free and well worth the hassle of contacting Shout! Factory to procure a replacement disc.  The replacement disc is an actual pressed disc (as opposed to a DVD-R or MOD disc) complete with all the additional special features and is visually identical to the original faulty disc with the exception of a different matrix onthe data side.<br /><br />I will not bump up my rating due to the foreseeable future of subsequent purchasers buying this edition and not realizing the faulty audio and what, if anything, they can do about it since Shout! Factory is not widely acknowledging a faulty pressing anywhere on their website (nor is amazon.com for that matter), especially on the pertinent product info page.  Thus I can envision plenty of fans who will go on with the rest of their movie viewing lives in complete ignorance of this issue.
B005LAJ212|5.0|i watch reveng on tv and love the show its so good i had to buy it good to set down and injoy a good first season
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game at the arcade, and this one is the closets. to those. love it! You must try it.
0790737345|5.0|Movie was in great condition even though the case was a little worn. No scratches or anything! This movie was amazing!!
B0079XPUOW|4.0|A quite satisfactory read as long as you don't take it seriously.  Plenty of humor, good imagination, and fairly well written.  On the other hand, nothing truly new, just interesting new takes on well explored themes. Just right for a longish airplane or train ride...
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|no words can describe how amazing this album is. it is different from all the dance pop songs out there, but it is still enjoyable. ever since i got the album, i have been playing it daily. the very first day i got it, i couldn't bear to stop it. it is THAT GOOD! the album is also proof that Lana Del Rey is a lyrical genius! sure some people might skip this album because of her performance on SNL, but let me tell you: DONT PASS ON THIS ALBUM. every performer has their bad moments and i guess that SNL performance was Lana's bad moment. you will regret it if you dont buy this album. i predict, this album, will be one of those albums that people will be willing to pay a lot of money for in the future. the album is just timeless, and there is nothing like it out there. it is unmistakably Lana.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|We thought this movie was a comedy but alas it was far from it.  However, it held our attention.  I liked the underlying message of patience and faith along with the idea of new beginnings.
B00846REIS|5.0|Although it is very similar to Fifty shades,, the journalism is much better.  The story is as hot and i am looking forward to the next book... I have pre-ordered it, and  can't wait till 10-2.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was a very good movie, looking forward to the next one(s).  Not a movie for little kids due to the nature,
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Another excellent CD by Il Divo!<br />I would encourage you to purchase it, along with all the others they have released over the years.
B007SGM084|5.0|Such a powerful and well written series! A love story with so much depth. I will read again and again. I ready the last book slowly because I didn't want the story to end!
B000BBOV8U|5.0|This is one of those albums where you can put it on and let it play,  no skipping certain songs,  every one is great
0785152458|4.0|A solid follow up to a great graphic novel.  This volume delivers as much gritty action as the last, but with even more vengance.  As with the last book the art is gorgeous and consistant.  The charecters feel very consistant with the first book and with each other.  I liked the first story better but this one does not disapoint with gratuitous offensive language and gory Hit Girl kills.  A very raw story not suited for the young or easily offended.
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|Ham On Rye is pure Bukowski, and if you haven't ever read him you're missing a treat and a major part of American writing. I'm looking for other work by this author and went to Blockbuster to see if I could rent a copy of Bar Fly, (:a story based on some of his writing and staring Fay Dunnaway and Micky Roark) but they said Not Available. Oh well, I'll check Amazon to see if I can buy a copy. Pure Bukowski, and if you love him you'll love this, and if you don't love him that's your f*****g problem.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|A lot of fun. Good story that was pretty simple to follow. A good mix of story and hidden object game with some puzzles thrown in. Can't wait for part 2!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is a very brisk account of the events that preceded and occurred during the bin laden raid. Because of the author's oath to preserve secrecy, the identities  of the participants, as well as some aspects of the raid itself, have been changed. It is difficult to know, therefore, what parts of the story are true or incomplete. Overall, the book is an exciting account of a difficult operation.<br />A good deal of the book tells the story of the training that the author and others underwent to become the\\" elite\\" among the elite forces.  It's impressive business, indeed. An enjoyable and thought-provoking read.
B00846REIS|5.0|I stumbled on reading this book after reading the 50 shades of grey trilogies. I honestly think \\"bared to you\\" is way better than \\"50 shades of grey\\", but both a good read!
B005LAII80|5.0|I heard good things about this movie, and now I see why. It got right to the point and gave us what we wanted; a good ol' fashioned shoot-em-up action flick. It's much better than the 1995 Stallone version. Judge Dredd is very sinister, yet bad ass. While investigating a homicide in the 200-story slum tower block Peach Trees, Judge Dredd and rookie Judge Anderson are locked in by Ma-Ma. (Ma-Ma is the dealer of an addictive new drug called SLO-MO) They must fight their way thru the building and execute Ma-Ma's men. Judgment is coming. I highly recommend DREDD!!!
0345803485|4.0|From virgin to nympho... in just 3 months<br /><br />First of all, I would like to state that I really enjoyed this book, and for that matter the trilogy. It would be hypocritical not to say so. However, as Meymoon accurately stated in his/her extraordinary, hilarious review, this book (trilogy) is so unrealistic that it is laughable, hence, very entertaining.<br /><br />We have this tortured Batman type of guy who simply excels in almost everything. The downside is that he actually gets his kicks from hurting young brunettes that resemble his mother. Still, there is almost no woman in the whole wide world immune to his charms, including, of course our tragic heroine.<br /><br />On the other hand, we have this incredibly beautiful, naive and innocent 21 year old, who seems oblivious of her appeal to almost every man she encounters (her former boss's brother, her male best friend, her female best friend's brother, her current boss and last, but not least, the incredibly attractive and irresistible Chrstian Grey).<br /><br />At the beginning of the trilogy, Anastasia (our very own fairy tale heroine) is very shy, uncoordinated, kind of clumsy and awkward aside from a reputed and unattainable virgin, who manages to become a complete nymphomaniac in the time frame of 3 months,<br />simply because she encounters and succumbs to the charms and sex lifestyle of Christian Grey. All of a sudden and very<br />inexplicably, this young woman, who at a certain point could be even considered uptight, finds it utterly impossible to resist Grey's<br />raw sexuality and cannot just get enough. She seems to warm up and embrace amazingly easily the options and situations Christian Grey introduces to her and becomes insatiable.  I think this is one of the things I found most entertaining, the fact that this young virgin so quickly succumbed and become addicted to  the temptations of a very intense, and not very common sex life... and still be able to walk and become a successful editor.<br /><br />However, as Cupcake stated in her/his reviews for Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, this trilogy is like literary crack,<br />you know is not good and you feel guilty about enjoying it so much, but you just can't stop!
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|I bought this product expecting to be able to cut wine bottles in two.  First, building the device almost takes an engineer.  Then, they tell you to score it gently, dip it in boiling water, then ice water, and repeat until the bottle breaks.  Out of 7 bottles that I scored only 1 broke with any semblance of a straight line.  Most broke but I got jagged lines - it didn't break along the score lines at all.  I expected clean straight lines and instead got jagged, sharp edges that I couldn't break away even with my glass nippers.  There must be a better way to cut a wine bottle in two.
B008XG1X18|5.0|its a must have app. l love how organized it is and it gives you some really great ideas. has a topic for everyone.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved the first two novels of this trilogy, and the third was a necessary addition--but some of the spark was gone.  Still a good read.
B00846REIS|5.0|I am hooked on the drama relationship between Eva and Gedion.  i cant wait to read the next one.  though i find it way to close to the story line of fifty shades.
B003D513TQ|4.0|A beautiful movie that shatters the little girl princess fantasy. A very realistic approach to the misfortune and burden of royal life. Emily Blunt soars as Queen Victoria.
B00138GXYU|5.0|This Album should have been her comeback. Blackout is way better than Circus, this album is the best on she made.
B004CURZFC|5.0|This is one of the most intelligent and cinematically beautiful movies I've seen in awhile. Great story with a great message. Highly recommend it.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|It was such a good book to read, really insightful. I enjoy using their products and have built web applications using Ruby On Rails (which 37 Signals is apart of), so understanding how they think about business and products really makes it easier for me to move forward in my profesional carear.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great!So easy to use and doesn't take up much memory! Easy to highlight and bookmark verses and I love that you can listen to someone read the it! I soo recommend it!
B0087HT36U|5.0|Great twist on angry birds. I wish I would have found this earlier the controls seem to work better than angry birds to!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|No, that's pretty much what I have to say on the subject. Don't. To quote the great Joan Rivers, \\"If you have a choice between reading this book, and dying in a plane crash, YOU GO DOWN ON THAT GODD**N PLANE.\\"
B000002AHC|5.0|For some strange reason I never owned this album when it was released 40 or so years ago, despite having seen them play an all-nighter at Middle Earth in London and thinking they were the best thing since sliced bread. How nice to make its acquaintance now and hear them in a time of transition, trying out arrangements with horns and strings. Like getting a belated insight into an old friend. And the extra tracks are a bonus too.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|If you get the free version there is only one level! You can't unlock anything unless you buy the three dollar version. Not worth it.
0345803485|5.0|Fifty shades is the most COMPELLING erotic moving books i ever read. I really love it! I read all three in one week, once i started i could not put the book down. i recommend these books to everyone. I cannot wait for E.L james to write more..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is so fun and fast no wonder is called flow. I love this app. As you progress it gets more challenging and it really makes u think.  :)
B00785P2QC|4.0|this is a pretty nice game .even when you are not playing the game still doing it.and whenyou return to aplay it ,you will receive all benefics
B00340I4KG|5.0|Both Travolta and Cage are brilliant in this movie; Nicholas is such a believable bad guy; But when Cage becomes Travolta..Travolta's acting skills triple.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I enjoyed how challenging. some levels. were and others were extremely easy. I couldn't put it down. The graphics were very good as well.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|They movies are very well done although i had some issues with certain scenes in Raiders and in Last Crusade. There were 3 or 4 scenes in which the picture got somewhat fuzzy. I paused it and it remained. It doesnt last very long but  it is noticeable enough to get your attention.<br /><br />Audio is exceptional on all but Raiders. There really isnt much in the way of 5.1 sound but it gets more dynamic with each movie as the technology improved. Still well worth the money and i felt like a kid all over again.
034553056X|5.0|Grisham has not lost his magic.<br />I laughed out loud from the first page of The Litigators and kept laughing throughout the novel.  The descriptions of his two \\"ambulance chasing\\" protagonists were hilarious and sympathetic. The young Harvard graduate lawyer who straightens out their lives is as interesting as the two lovable bumbleheads, and the book is great fun from beginning to end.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Excellent descriptive account of the mission. I came away with a deeper appreciation of the personal sacrifices and courage our military and intelligence forces show on a daily basis. To think our operators conducted this raid within walking distance of the Pakistani equivalent to West Point and executed it with zero casualties is breathtaking.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was one of the best games I've played. It has amazing graphics and a good story line. I can't wait for the sequel.
B007TMON8M|4.0|Over all the game is pretty entertaining and you can spend a lot of time trying to tweak designs to get under the 3 star threshold. The game does have some quarks to where designs you don't think should work do and those that you think should fail miserably.
B0083V2W6I|5.0|Quadrophenia is a cult classic for anyone ever involved in the Mod scene. Either the original of the 1960s or its place amongst the two-tone Ska scene of the early 80s.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game! I play it every chance I get!  My kids play  this all the time! I love to slice fruitful!
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Enjoyed this Bosch book but I do feel it was a little drug out---especially toward the end. But then I was also sorry to see it end because I become friends with the characters in the books. Thank you for a good story.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|AS all books by David Baldacci, it is well written and very entertaning.  Once you starting reading this book it is hard to put down.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|If you like match 3 games you MUST get ToM3. I have had it for just s few days and I am completely hooked !
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game. It is hours of fun. I find it easy to play and also challenging. Great price. Another great app from Amazon.
B0088P2A7A|2.0|Wiki is showing a minimized version of a topic at the beginning which I did not like at all. To read the entire document, the readers need to maximize section by section which is annoying.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The movie started off slow then it progressed. There wasn't  any intense part where it made you go \\"Wow!\\". The movie was over hyped.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|I watched this Movie Like 10 times And I can still watch it again Like I said good story You won't be disappointed
1594744769|4.0|I'm going to say up front that I would've liked this book more if it wasn't obviously the beginning of a series, w/no real ending of it's own.  Like when I read Hunger Games, I had no idea it was a trilogy.<br /><br />Anyway, it's freaky but good if you're a sci-fi fan, tho sometimes I felt like the device of using old, sort of creepy photos got in the way of the real story.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read this book and was amazed at the story line.  Definitely great reading.  i bought it on my amazon kindle and it was so good i wanted the hard copies so i bought the complete set of paperback books and read it again.  Sure there is alot of sex but more than that the love of a woman for a man that is broken is what keeps you reading!
B0095R64AO|2.0|I rented this to watch on a rainy day because I love Emily Blunt in \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" and love Jason Segal in \\" How I Met Your Mother.\\" It started with a cute idea and funny dialogue and soon became long and painful to watch...the movie lost all its fun halfway through and I lost all interest in watching. Good cast, but the script is too poorly written to showcase the talents of its main actors.
B0034G4OUO|4.0|Faster has great acting, fast cars and fun action sequences. Very fast-paced revenge flick and the characters all have an inner conflict to deal with that keeps the movie interesting - overall good movie.
B004LSO6YI|3.0|Nice movie to watch but not worth buying. It was a better finished product than Claire of the Moon, which Nicole Conn also filmed. Better acting, better film quality.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|addictive<br />I play it every few hours throughout the day<br />if you restart your town you can live the struggle all over again
0307744434|5.0|This book is one of those magical books that take you to another place, another time, another dimensions.  It's magic is as everyday as the wizard's magic in Harry Potter and just as engaging and, at times, as dark and dangerous.<br /><br />It's also incredibly well written.  I loved the Night Circus.
B0039HR5QS|3.0|\\"Three Days of the Condor\\" came out around the time of the Watergate scandal, and sort of begins the genre of spy flicks in which the US Government represents the bad guys instead of the good guys.  The Watergate Era theme is hard to miss.  Other things about this flick are dated.  Redford holds an innocent woman prisoner in her own home, but its OK because hey, wouldn't most young women like to be held prisoner by Robert Redford?  Well, at least Robert Redford back in his prime.<br /><br />This film was kind of interesting when it first came out due to its negative portrayal of the CIA and US Government.  This kind of theme is now passe, and after seeing this film again after all these years, I have to say that this film is also somewhat passe.  The book (\\"Six Days of the Condor\\" -- mercifully, they cut the days in half for the movie) was better, actually.  RJB.
B008602KQI|5.0|I'm always skeptical of film adaptations of well loved books, but this one is brilliant! It's true to the book but not a scene by scene repeat. The casting is perfect! Jennifer Lawrence is a great choice for Katniss.<br /><br />I was wondering how they would demonstrate the violence in the book since it's kids killing each other. I think they captured it tastefully as you never see the actual \\"kill shot.\\"<br /><br />I loved the books, and so far, the movies are great.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book was so good I finished it in 2 days (and I'm a busy woman).  It had me thinking about and questioning time, life, and even history and theology. If you like to read and skip reading this book, you're wasting your time.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Let me purchase it, then said to search for it in the app store on my KF.  Nowhere to be found to download it.<br />Suggestions???
B0055SWM08|4.0|It seems boring at first, but it gets more fun as you move on. A more relaxed puzzle game. Great for boredom.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|If you play those coin pushing games in the arcade, this is your new addiction.  It is mindless, pointless entertainment that I personally can not get enough of it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is so addictive! This app is great. I haven't had any issues as some of the other reviewers have had.
B004UID2LC|3.0|i love that it downloads and u can make your own play list but it js very slow and somtimes dose not play or download the sonhs that u want it to
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app is by far one of the best apps I have ever purchaced from the app store. I love it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I think I read it in one weekend.  Very engaging and interesting and romantic!!  All the things I love when reading for entertainment.  Perfect choice!
B008XG1X18|4.0|has a few issues but overall I'm satisfied with this app. the only issues is that it will not bring it up on my kindle and it says I have to do a force shut down.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The Hunger Games is enjoyable enough. Well acted, good photography, special effects, sound track, all well done. But, the story is contrived and predictable right up to the end (an obvious setup for the inevitable sequel).  The characters are unrealistic and idealized. The motivations, the relationships, the whole social ethos is badly out of sync.  I think it's for young people looking for clear cut heroes that challenge the evil status quo. It's good action/adventure/romance but please don't consider it as serious drama.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|For all the great sword and sandal films of the 1950's Ridley Scott's epic recounting of the legend around the death of Marcus Aurelius stands out for it's economy of narrative diversion . Scott cuts right to the heart of how brave men live....and die.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Whole series was great! Hope there are more to come! This book was wonderful, getting to see the characters in a way we haven't with the other books. Well done!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Thank you Amazon for putting this up !! This appears to be an actual app that works great on the fire hd. It also works well with the camera (not many apps that access this feature on new kindles). The app itself is worthy of 4 stars, but I am just so happy I have one now, that I am rating it a 5  !!!
B005LAII6M|5.0|Honestly I am a major fan or horror movies and zombie movies and such movies like that. I fell in love with the Resident Evil movies and this one just had me excited throughout the whole movie. I was so excited to see what Alice (Milla Jovovich) would do next. She, as always, is bad ass in this movie. I can't wait for the 6th one and I definitely cannot wait for this one to be released on DVD because I will absolutely buy it. I love Resident Evil to death. Best movie series ever! I think the length of the movie was good, but I do honestly have to say that I wish it were longer. But for the money I paid to see it in 3D at the theaters, it was well worth it. This is coming from a major Resident Evil fanatic. Haha. I recommend this movie to anyone.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Not really going to pontificate about how great they look or sound. Can sum it up in one word, outstanding (no exclamation point). The extras, again a thumbs' up.  One thing about the extras though, not all the Crystal Skull special features got ported over. So if you got it, save it. If you didn't, get it.  if you bought any exclusives you might want to keep them. Got the Best Buy Trilogy with the extra Vintage Featurette disc and the Target book exclusive and learned not to dump any special editions.<br /><br /> Now lets get to the reason this gets four stars and not five. It's really not about these movies in particular, it's about he packaging. The first Blu-ray book style packaging I got was Avatar.  It had a nice little tray and you could pull out the disc about half way to grab it. Then came Star Wars, yikes! A semi-tray that I had to stick my finger under the disc and pull it out. Not a fan of this because I don't like to grab the playing surface of the disc. This goes back to the first DVDs and players. Any scratches or fingerprint smudges affected playback. As the lasers got better it wasn't so much an issue but still hate to touch the disc.<br /><br />This packaging really threw me. not only did I have to pinch the disc to grab it but it really is an effort to pull it out. Can't tell for sure but there is something in the page/sleeve that is retaining the disc. Don't know if it's to keep them from falling out if you happen to hold the book by the spine with the pages down. Equal effort to put them back in. I know Blu-rays are supposed to be tough but, we really don't need to test that with this type of packaging.<br /><br />I know, I know. You think I'm trying to find something wrong in an otherwise perfect release. Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend this set.  Just trying to give the whole picture. If you bought this you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't then I'm giving you a head's up.<br /><br />As always just speaking as a consumer and fan of the medium. Every day takes us one step closer to finally retiring our VCR's and giving the tapes to charity. Thank you Phillips for pursuing laser video technology.<br /><br />P.S. When is 1941 going to be on Blu-ray, Steven?an of the medium. Every day takes us one step closer to finally retiring our VCR's and giving the tapes to charity. Thank you Phillips for pursuing laser video technology.<br /><br />P.S. When is 1941 going to be on Blu-ray, Steven?
B00913DPW2|1.0|There aren't enough negative words for this TERRIBLE game! This was made on the cheap....big time. Must have been a school experimentation. Seriously, bad graphics, hard to find the puzzle pieces and everything else. Bad maneuverability. Dull looking rooms. Nothing spooky or interesting about it. I couldn't even finish I was so bored and annoyed. Did the good reviewers get paid or something? Total Crap.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Have recommended the book to friends. UBL part a bit underwhelming. The author probably had to hold back a lot.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Just like everything other season; it's a twists and turns type of show that always keeps you wanting to press play to watch the next episode. Always intriguing! One of the BEST shows currently on television.<br /><br />And Amazon always delivers.....great quality of video at a great price.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I found Gone Girl just OK. The first half of the book dragged on. The second half of the book picked up and there was a surprise ending. The characters were just not very believable. It did pick up somewhat at the end.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well, yes, you either hate it or love it. Believable or not.  Yep, I laughed seriously out loud at 'the not only deep throat, but swallow first time'. And the endless amount of orgasms, most of us can only dream.  And BOY do I dream!  Ha!  I am still in withdrawals..panting. Yes, I squirmed alot! But fortunately I am a believer!!  Is it possible to have alot of orgasms?  I believe, YES! Will it always be at the mercy and hand of my 'Fifty'?  NO  But Fifty Shades Of Grey oh so lights my flame. And I so want to please HIM to no end!  Not a teenager anymore (knocking on FIFTY), but still feel like one!  Thanks E.L. James
B0088RQ4TI|3.0|It was okay,  From the reviews I had read I had expected a better movie.  Okay to see once, but wouldn't watch it again
0553386794|1.0|I wasn't expecting Lord of the Rings quality, but so many of my friends said it was a good series so I bought the first book in the series. Thank god I only bought the first one. I find it completely dull and it seems to jump without making decent correlations when going back to a character. I defiantly don't see the hype in it. Next book please!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|not something i would normally read, but i had to see what all the fuss was about. was a very good book, well written.
