0071762345|5.0|I'm not a beginner to some social media, but after reading this book it is quite clear that I didn't really have the specific mindset that I should have been in.  Instead of attempting to market, we need to connect - that is the biggest and most clear message that I received from this book.  By it's nature, social media is, well, social. And to succeed we must be social.  This book outlines lots of different strategies that can be implemented in order meet that goal.<br /><br />My end point: This book is worth the month, and the read.  If you are a small business owner, and attempting to grow and engage in online-media, you better read this before your competitors do.<br /><br />Christopher

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|So I love the crossfire series. The day it FINALLY came out I waited til that night to buy it because i wanted 2 read a couple reviews. And boy was I worried. It sounded like i wasen't going to like it @ all. I mean theres like a ton of 3 star reviews. Well for me if u can get over it not being a tri(3)books that is now turning into 5books. And how this book kept pushing back the publishing date (which I'm still miffed over,and swear to whatever they better not do it again:) And read this not being pissed off from the get go,u find why u or aleast i fell in love w/these books. Yes they have some trouble but come on its Eva and Cross. And yes I dont disagree w/some of the reviewers saying Ms.Day put alot of other plots into this book and Im not to sure how I feel about that. But I guess if theres going 2 be another 2 more books I guess she's got to. Anyways it doesn't take away the love story @ all. If u liked the crossfire series,then I think ull like this one as well. I suggust u start over and reread from the beganing and see if it doesn't put a smile on ur face.It did mine an I'll be buying book 4. I just hope I dont have 2 wait to long for it.

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Flash back to my childhood!  I enjoy playing.  I wish there were ways to earn or purchase the &quot;cash&quot; with the coins in the game.  I am not going to spend real money on that.  And seriously, do people really do that?

B00C9U9YOW|4.0|I got into QOTSA because of Josh Homme's work in Kyuss, and it was the alternative metal style in \\"R\\" and Songs for the Deaf that I really enjoyed.  And that's my only complaint about this album--it's great, but even the most classic QOTSA-sounding track \\"I Sat By the Ocean\\" (while well-written and performed, like the rest of the album) didn't rock as hard.<br /><br />Of course, I'm all for bands branching out and experimenting with new sounds, and these guys nailed it.  It's slower, darker and thoroughly enjoyable.  Maybe the next album will be heavier than any of their previous works?<br /><br />Update: Still enjoying it.  4.5 stars.  Hopefully it isn't \\"all downhill from here\\" as Homme says.

0547848412|5.0|I saw the movie first and wanted more of the story. As the book was written first, it was the movie which took license to create a more accessible story or at least one which viewers would prefer. Some of the confusing elements from the movie were better explained in the novel. However, I was disappointed by the fact that the love interest (girlfriend) of Pi was only in the movie.<br />The book itself is written as if Martel has done research and interviews with Pi, Mamaji, and the Japanese insurance adjusters. It is more likely that Martel drew upon his own college majors to craft Pi's post castaway life. Although there are chapters from 1 to 100, it is also necessary to read the Foreword grasp the story. These chapters range in length from two words to more than a dozen book pages. In addition the book is divided into three sections: India (Contemporary Pi in Canada and Pi's early life in Pondicherry), Shipwreck (at sea surviving and fending off vicious animals), and a wrap up in Mexico. The text becomes quite visceral as Pi is required to eat and drink things most would find disgusting. The depth of Pi's physical and emotional demise is  painstakingly explored. Martel does a good job of communicating Pi's concerns as he and Richard Parker spend what might as well have been their dying days adrift at sea. Some levity is used in the writing focusing on the retelling in Mexico. Pi's life in India also contains such levity surrounding his practicing of three religions, the contrast with his rational minded father hoping for a progressive India, and assorted name games with two Mr. Kumars and avoiding the teasing from his own unique full first name.<br />It becomes a novel telling of spiritual growth in conjunction with the realities of the animal kingdom with allegory to zoology. Despite the big furry tiger which we might expect not to actually harm Pi afterall, the story is full of grave descriptions keeping it from being suitable for children younger than mid teens. It is an intriguing adult read for its usage of themes and analogs to spirituality and animal studies.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|I didn't read the advertising closely enough or I would have realized I didn't want anything to do with it.  There is a legal doctrine that says if you provide a third party with your private information, you have no reasonable expectation of privacy.

B00C2VIA52|3.0|This game is enjoyably complex and addictive.  I am pleased that \\"real money\\" is not necessary to play.  The need for strategy in deck-building as well as actual play makes it more than just a \\"button-pusher.\\"<br /><br />All that said- two things prevent me from rating it higher.<br /><br />First- the spell-casting button is almost impossible to activate on the Kindle Fire.  In the solo campaign, this is not a big deal- you can keep trying until it figures out \\"OH- that's what you wanted!\\"  But in on-line matches against other players- there is a timer... which means you can lose simply because of poor interface design.  Gameloft- PLEASE fix this!<br /><br />Second- it appears that on-line opponents who are afraid of losing can just Pause until you get tired of waiting- have to turn off your device- etc.  There needs to be a \\"forfeit timer\\" if someone stays paused for an inordinate amount of time.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|\\"SPOILER ALERT!\\" I disagree with the people that were a)disappointed with this book and b)thought Sylvia was dragging it out for the dough. If you've read book one and two, you are obviously the fan all the gratuitous sex, otherwise you would not have bought the third, so why you hatin'? Gideon and Eva are well written characters so I'm fine with spending more time with them before the inevitable end. On the other hand I do think this is a filler book, just like that episode of Downtown Abbey where nothing really happens or that Harry Potter movie. There are a LOT of unresolved question left in this tale and I personally liked that Sylvia is adding more intrigue to Nathan's murder and a little twist with Corinne in this book, the question will becomes how she will tie everything in neat little bow. We still have Gideon's nightmares to deal with, did we see a breakthrough after the mile high club scene? Gideon's deal with his family, especially his Ice Queen mom; the whole re-appearance of Dr. Lucas' wife (WHAT! Intrigue, I told you!); Cary's baby mama drama (Yep, you heard right); Monica and Victor's affair; Monica's relationship with Eva; the reporter; Brett; the sex-video; Gideon wanting to have Eva work for him AND the fact that Eva's Krav Maga YOU KNOW will have to come in handy at some point. With so much unresolved, why wouldn't Sylvia lengthen it out to another book? You can make one book on Gideon's family alone, there is something not right there. Stop hatin' and enjoy she show.

B008Y768XO|3.0|Hachi - A dog's tale was a sweet film.  Certainly appropriate for the family.  I liked it and yet there were holes in the story that bothered me to the point that I would limit my stars to 3 instead of 4.<br />How the dog came to it's owner (Richard Gere) was a little sketchy, perhaps it was suppose to be.  The devotion of dog & master was lovely and yet I had problems with the wife's attitude through the entire film.<br />I found out at the end that this was fashioned after a real life dog and series of events and sincerely wish that the writers had chosen a storyline a little closer to the truth and hadn't tried so hard to &#34;Hollywood&#34; it up.<br />Still in all it was a pleasant passing of 2 hours with a few sniffles thrown in for good measure.

140131046X|5.0|How would you respond if your childhood `man of God' asked you to write a Eulogy for his own funeral? In the book `Have a Little Faith' by Mitch Albom, that is exactly what happens.  In this book you go on a journey with Mitch himself as he tells his story and experience with his Rabi, Albert Lewis.  What he thinks will be a week or two of getting to know his Rabi, turns into eight years of a loving friendship. This book opens your eyes and heart not only to faith but what the true meaning of Church is. Mitch Albom does not only go over his experience of getting closer to his Faith, Judaism, but opens up to other faiths as well by taking you through a ride between two religions  of two different men of two different communities that show what faith is all about.<br /> The book begins with Albert Lewis asking Mitch to write his eulogy. As Mitch could not say no, he thought the only way he could even be worthy of writing his Rabbi's eulogy is to actually get to know him and not just as a clergyman but as a human being as well. So, the book is divided into four different parts; Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter and as it goes through the seasons and years Mitch takes you back and forth through time and his memories with the Reb (Albert Lewis) and his time he had spent with him. He portrays the Reb as one of the most open minded and kind hearted man you could have ever met. The Reb not only taught lessons on Judaism, but on life itself. He had no hatred or discontent for any other religion or for what anyone else believed in for that matter. In the eulogy that Mitch had written for the Reb he stated, \\"You waited until the Catholic schoolkids were in recess, playing in the schoolyard, then you and the priest strolled around the perimeter, arm in arm showing that different faiths can indeed walk side by side, in harmony\\" (page 239, line 10).  The Reb had not only opened up Mitch's eyes to this, but to mine as well. No matter what you had believed in, there was a unity between any and all religions. Mitch Albom shows you through his eyes by bringing Henry into the story.<br /> The Life of Henry often comes in the story through the seasons that Mitch writes about. Henry is a troubled young man who lives in New York that becomes a drug addict, thief, and hustler. Through all of his life experiences he believes that God had been there sheltering him from what could have been a worse life. After stealing dope from a local drug dealer he had realized that he hit rock bottom, because the drug dealer knew where he lived and could very easily come to his home and kill not only him, but his wife and young daughter. Henry waited outside all night with a shotgun and pleaded to God that if he spared him this one last time that he would give himself to Him. Henry  whispered  \\"If I promise to give myself to you, will you save me tonight?\\" (page 84, line 15).  So after that night, he did. Henry cleaned up and started making his way to become a Pastor at a church in Detroit.  Mitch ends up going to this church in the city where he now lived, looking to give charity, and that is how he meets Henry. Mitch had doubted Henry at first, but soon came to realize that Henry was not the crook he once was, but that Henry was a `Man of God'.  This journey with Henry opens his heart to the Christian faith, and even though Mitch will always have Judaism as his religion he attends this Christian mass on Sundays every so often.<br /> The book comes to a sad and inevitable close as Mitch brings to life the last moments of the Rebs life and of course one beautiful, touching eulogy. He speaks that of the Reb's never ending positive energy, even through the pain of his death.  The Reb had only one fear that was what he called the `second death' or being completely forgotten after he passes. I believe Mitch Albom wrote this book specifically so that the `second death' could never happen to Albert Lewis. Without ever having met either Henry or Albert Lewis my life feels impacted through their journeys, words of wisdom, and their commitment to faith.  This is an amazing book by Mitch Albom that is deeply moving and very inspiring.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|ENTWINED WITH YOU is the third storyline in Sylvia Day's erotic, contemporary Crossfire series focusing on Gideon Cross and the woman he would kill for-Eva Trammel.<br /><br />At the end of REFLECTED IN YOU Gideon and Eva's life had been cemented together with the knowledge about who killed Eva's step-brother and the secrets from each other's past-pasts filled with betrayal, abuse and questionable parenting from all concerned. Entwined With You furthers the storyline yet does very little in the way of developing a different direction for the leading couple or continuing the story.<br /><br />Many questions from the second book have been answered-questions regarding some of Gideon's behavior and Eva's mistaken beliefs. But a good portion of this particular novel involves sex and issues of trust-and there is plenty of sex between our leading couple-in the bedroom; in the kitchen; on the couch; on the floor; in the shower; on the plane; in the office and....well, you get the idea ! Sex in this series has always been prevalent and a major part of the storyline but I felt overwhelmed very quickly.<br /><br />Issues of trust, once again, come to the forefront as past lovers continue to force themselves into Gideon and Eva's lives. Whether in the guise of love or obsession, these ex-lovers will wreak havoc for our couple. From Corinne to Brett and another from Gideon's past, as well as some revealing video, Eva and Gideon must weather the firestorm that continues to burn hot and bright.<br /><br />But I am not sure where Sylvia is going with this particular series. She was originally contracted for a trilogy -3 books- but now there are plans for a total of 5. Most (but not all) of the major issues between Gideon and Eva have been solved as well as some important aspects of their future, therefore, Sylvia has ventured into secondary character storylines. The secondary characters including Eva's parents, Megumi and especially Cary's love triangle with Trey and Tatiana, will all play a much more prominent role in future storylines. Sylvia Day has used Entwined With You as the building block to several potential story arcs in the series that may or may not directly involve Eva and Gideon (although all secondary characters are connected to the couple) and, therefore their stories will reflect directly back.<br /><br />The relationship between Gideon and Eva continues to be very physical and co-dependent. There is rarely a moment where they were not touching or kissing or enticing the other into another round of steamy sex or forbidden touch. They risk public disclosure and decency laws on more than one occasion. The bond between Gideon and Eva is one of need and want; love and obsession. They are each other's addiction. Regardless of Gideon's need to protect and defend, there is also his need FOR Eva as well. He is a man who is unable to function without the woman that he loves. At some point Gideon will want to take their relationship to the next level.<br /><br />Overall, Entwined With You is an interesting storyline but one that I found not to be on the same level as the previous two books. Perhaps there is the issue of expanding the trilogy into a series of five and therefore a different approach and direction was required to shape and construct the new storyline arc but there is a definite lack of closure and satisfaction in book three.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just enough of a challenge to make it fun. I didn't know if I would like this app. Decided to try it and was surprised. Now I'm ready for more rooms.
B00AFPVPDG|5.0|Bought it because of the great TED talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY but, I was worried that it would be a rehash of what was in 4 Hour Chef by Tim Ferris [[ASIN:0547884591 The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life]] that I already had.  This is not so!  Both look at the same subject (rapid skill acquisition) but, from different enough viewpoints that you need to buy both books.  Have no clue which you should read first but, I would have to say The First 20 Hours is more general and gives several examples that are easier to do.  The major difference between the two books is that this one is to get you over the \\"frustration\\" hump so that you can do something good enough and Ferris's book is better at something that would take you 6 months to become world class in.  Interestingly each book has a skill in it that would be better in the others book.  Ferris has rope tying that would be great here and Josh has the game of Go that would be better in Tim's.  The first skill I am going to try is learning the new keyboard.  And I found something on Amazon that would help [[ASIN:B007YGPZ76 LEARNING COLEMAK KEYBOARD LABELS]]
B009NY43NY|2.0|This safe, boring, and nearly thrill-less final Sookie Stackhouse installment by Harris was a big let down.  With seemingly endless ways to thrill fans it was quite disappointing to discover that not one real surprise was waiting for me (or anyone else) in \\"Dead Ever After\\".  As a huge Sookie fan, I rather expected Harris to serve up plenty of twists, turns, and certainly exciting plot lines to sink my teeth into as the Sookie saga was brought to an end.  Instead there is a palpable feeling of being starved of any imaginative storytelling by Harris who, instead rather thinly wraps up the story lines of minor characters, while frustratingly ignoring major characters.  Ultimately, this was a tedious and oftentimes boring read that left me feeling anemic.
B00009NQQO|4.0|This is very simple and my kids really enjoy playing with it in the tub. I especially appreciate the fact that the balls can be stored right in the net, and the suction cups are actually effective, unlike in many kids' toys. Lots of fun!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|okay. I admit it I love this game. it is amazing. except there is only 8 levels :(. I want more for free!!! it is so fun. and can be hard. I say get it
B001UGB1X8|1.0|It's not just this movie, most of what is out there is garbage, this is just another one. I expect better  from T.L.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I do most of the cooking around the house, and just got brand new cookware and they work great in them, I like the way they sit on the counter when your cooking with them, the only thing is, I wish I got the rack they go with them, that all.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really simple to use...does everything I need it to do. The buttons are big and the calculator is easy for my son to use to check his work
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Saw a program on PBS, knew I had to purchase &#34;Live In London&#34; by Leonard Cohen.<br />This CD is now my new favorite. Love...Love..LOVE IT.  Plan on buying several more copies for gifts.
B003LL3LHO|4.0|It was a very good read. The pacing felt odd at times. I wasn't really expecting it to end the way it did.  That was nice.  I look forward to more by these authors.
0143122916|5.0|I challenge everyone to read this and take a personal look at what you do with the leftovers of your life.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This was a good movie, but it was more about the political abolition of slavery in the US, than Abraham Lincoln.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|This game was fun (I beat it) but their were only four chapters and four levels in each chapter.  I have to admit that probably one or two of the levels in each chapter were pretty hard and it took two days to beat the level but other wise it was ok. I don't know if it is really worth 99 cents but it is pretty fun.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|I guess the current generation of producers have run out of ideas and need to feed off of someone else's success. These remake re-run movies remind of a Rapper taking a perfectly good song and destroying it for a profit and demonstrate their lack of talent. Com on man! take away the uniforms, star trek theme and star trek characters and what you are left with is a boring CSI type movie with Khan playing a Terrorist? Give me a break.
0439023491|5.0|Started off slow but by the middle I couldn't put it down!! Such a great second book and what a cliff hanger at the end!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|My daughter suggested I read Percy Jackson and the series.  I was drawn into the books instantly.  What a great series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was really good, took a couple chapters to get hooked but then I was hooked for the whole series and so was my husband!!
B004529NKC|5.0|We have all the step up movies.  Although they are all about dancing, they provide a different atmosphere with each one.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I thought the story line was interesting but she repeated herself a lot and spent more time in details that did not further the storyline.
B00280LYHS|5.0|My daughter suggested I read Percy Jackson and the series.  I was drawn into the books instantly.  What a great series.
B0086700CM|5.0|OK this app is so fun.You can buy coins for real money but also run for them there are people you can download using your coins and I don't think that the game ends but it's really fun if I where you I would get it I mean even the graphics are cool there is temple run 2 and  brave temple run get them all I know I have more to say I HATE how u can only do one comment I think of stuff later but if there is any words u don't get find a word that is the same couse I have auto correct
B003TSEL7S|5.0|My daughter suggested I read Percy Jackson and the series.  I was drawn into the books instantly.  What a great series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read! I couldn't put the book down. It is a real page turner.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My daughter suggested I read Percy Jackson and the series.  I was drawn into the books instantly.  What a great series.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I have to admit - didn't see Cruise as \\"Reacher\\", initially - but he was more than credible, and there were good action scenes!  Plot is - well, thin - but intense in places where Cruise broods & frets.  Overall, a decent action flick.
B00280LYIM|5.0|My daughter suggested I read Percy Jackson and the series.  I was drawn into the books instantly.  What a great series.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|We really enjoyed the movie, but it was not very clear.  It would have been clearer if I had recorded it on a VHS from broadcast tv over a previously recorded show/movie.  I've never had a problem with Amazon rentals and purchases before, so I was very surprised by the poor quality.  It was blurry the whole time.  The movie itself was very good though!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This is one fantastic tool.  This was bought for the wife to use with her new Kindle Fire HD.  She said she wished she had known of  this unit a long time ago.  She also uses it with smart phone and itouch.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|This novel is my favorite. I absolutely love all the characters, plot, etc. I think this story can never grow old. It makes me think and reflect.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Game has problem loading up correctly after 2 or 3 times playing it, like it literally crashes when you try to collect on your dinosaurs, then I need to shut off and restart my Kindle HD Fire. Otherwise, cool game.
B003XHLIUS|5.0|Love this action figure looks movies accurate.<br />only dislike is the blade falls out allot<br />i use it for propping and posing<br />item was way above expectations.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this app is soooooo fun!!!! u can buy lots of upgrades like a dog so cute buy it now every body have fun with it
B000P6PVLC|1.0|It was like watching a soap opera. Very slow paced.  Brad Pitt had a really simple role that any small actor could have played. The Nanny did the most acting, and if anyone wins an award for this film it's her.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My daughter loves it. She plays it with her friends. She loves to create new looks. All young girls will buy it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|To be honest, I was sold on this book before I read it - you get to be a fly on the wall of one of the most important missions ever undertaken by special forces. It's one of those books that you find yourself skim reading because you are so desperate to find out what happens at the bottom of the page, just so you can get to the page after that.<br /><br />Top notch.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Easy free app.  Fast download.  Pretty easy to navigate.  Have to put up with the ads but there are not that many.  Really great for taking pictures on the Kindle HD and immediately posting to facebook.
B004UPANGM|5.0|A classic horror comedy.  The first was terrible....this is somewhat a parody of that.<br />This makes fun of itself in a witty way.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|Yet again a director without a clue. Want to see how camera 'shake' should be used, but not overused, see Saving Private Ryan or The Avengers. Want to see how it detracts from a shot and ruins a movie because you are thinking more about the herky-jerky view rather than the scene, see this movie.<br />PLEASE GET A CLUE and stop ruining what could have been a very fun movie.<br />Script and characters very good for what it is, unfortunately they couldn't overcome the pathetically amateur work of the director and production staff (it looks like something my mom shot). Don't agree, then explain how when the dog is running out to greet Clark in the driveway, we need a shaky camera that takes the emphasis away from the Americana moment and places it onto the production method. Pathetic, selfish, amateurish and self centered.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read the three books by this author and they are all captivating from the first page.  His books do not disappoint.
0060920084|2.0|How many ways can you describe people as \\"fat\\" and \\"stupid\\"? Here, Bill Bryson's tried to best the previous record! These references are mixed with his usual delightful narratives and after-thought twists/zingers; however, the balance tips against finishing this book. 'May be bad timing - reading a book written in 1989 now - when USA-bashing (especially of heartland-folks and -heritage) isn't such fun anymore - if it ever was.<br />Also, after ridiculing poor punctuation on public signs, I'd take more care to clean up misplaced commas around parenthetical phrases that occur within series.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Loved it!!!!  She has such great characters. Can't wait for next book. The world she has created is so special. I always hate to see the books end.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|As recounted in Shatner's \\"Star Trek Memories\\" book - which was not mainly about him but about how the series came to be and its travails - while pitching the original series to the networks, Roddenberry was invited in for a much longer pitch session than usual, with all of one network's top production people, and enthusiastically explained how it could be done on a reasonable budget - and then saw his ideas used, without him, to make \\"Lost in Space.\\"<br /><br />Voyager is the Trek universe's answer to that series. Voyager is about a Federation ship whisked to the opposite side of the galaxy, 75 years away from home, and its adventures on the trek back.<br /><br />Add in a captain played as the reincarnation of Kate Hepburn, a crew composed of the formerly opposed crews of the Federation ship and the Maquis ship it was pursuing, a holographic doctor who's equal parts Bones and Data (the ever-present \\"Spock premise\\" about humanness arising out of the tension between rational self-interest and concern for others), and visual beauty - including the ship itself, models of which a local crafts shop had trouble keeping in stock because it was so popular (as Hepburn said in The Philadelphia Story, \\"That ship was yar\\") - and you have a great show.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|A really riveting story of obsession.....<br />The story of tragedy is undeniable .  It explores many many different feelings. Worth reading
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|This album is great! I think is the best album that QotSA has put out so far.  The reprise on \\"I Appear Missing,\\" is great and shows off guitar chops.  All of the songs are really good and I rarely find myself skipping any track.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very well written book. Great storyline made it difficult to put down. Interesting characters and shifts in the plot kept me interested to the end.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I really wanted to like this book but I just couldn't and the ending is terrible. I had no sympathy for either of the protagonists and it felt like I was reading a bad Hollywood script proposal.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|Sometimes i think that´s just what i have found out, sometimes i realize i am repeating the same mistakes. Recommend to every woman.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I honestly thought this book was a joke. It was painfully boring and nothing really happened. Same s#@t ..different day. I seriously hope the series gets better considering there was no character or plot development. I thought the author said Gideon was so complex that's why the book was delayed. Nothing even got explored about his past that we didn't already know. His mom is a goofy ass and he is still on meds. Ookaaayyy and??? Cary is a total douche bag and Eva is a brat. The only fun part was when her parents hooked up! At least there was something in the story but then that plot line got squashed!!!  Oh and chapter18!!! My friends and I are over the Crossfire series!
B0035JNRXU|4.0|As movie it fails to deliver. As a follow up episode to the series it's exceptional. A very fun time.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is a great LOL like game. Many &quot;Heroes&quot; to choose from and great gamelay. this has to be my favorate game on my kindle fire.<br /><br />But there still is one thing that is terriable about this game. I can't play it anymore.<br /><br />it was a normal day and I just launched the game. but 5 seconds after it opened the main menu. it booted me to the kindle home menu. please help gameloft because this is 1 of my favorate games made by you.
B000V5Y1SQ|3.0|I watched TNG and Voyager before starting season one. So far I have not been able to get into the cast of DS9. The concept is good so I'll keep watching for now.
0345525558|5.0|I love this book and bought two copies for my sisters. It such a story of redemption and healing fo the character.
193700788X|4.0|Thought the last book of the series would have a better ending, what a letdown.  She could have done better.
B009IJJ8UM|2.0|Wow, I can't say how disappointed I was with this show.  Their Sherlock Holmes and Watson have absolutely nothing in common with the original characters at all, nor do the stories.  It's your standard police procedural that I've seen a hundred times in CSI, NCIS, Law & Order, etc.  The only things it has in common with the original stories are the names of the characters, and Sherlock is smart.  He wasn't a tatooed, sexualized, co-dependent, drug addicted maniac.  And Watson wasn't anything at all like this Watson (and no, it has nothing at all to do with her as a woman, because I am fine with that).  I found myself wanting to stop watching half-way through the episode, I was so bored with the story...but I stuck it out to the end.  And some of the acting is just bad.  I'm not a stickler for \\"being like the books\\", but I seriously don't see how this has anything to do with Sherlock Holmes.  It's not even a really good police procedural, either.  My suggestion: check out the BBC's \\"Sherlock\\".  It's better written, acted and more faithful than this version is.
B00C061I3K|5.0|THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST ELECTRONIC CD IN MANY MANY YEARS!!! TO THE ROOTS!!! AMAZING-YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED AT ALL!!! GO DAFT PUNK---IF THEY DON'T GET GRAMMY AWARDS FOR THIS CD IT IS A CRIME!!!!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This wasn't your typical romance, and it wasn't your typical zombie flick either. I actually really liked that about this film. It was pretty funny too and really cute. I enjoyed it a lot!
B004YRSBTW|5.0|Christopher Nolan gave the world notice in this visionary, virtuoso contemporary film-noir. Worth a second viewing, and a third. Brilliant!
B0094K1QR8|4.0|This movie has a great cast of characters filled with a love story and plenty of comedy. I would recommend this movie for the person who likes the guy gets girl in the end and likes a few laughs along the way.
B0063IH60K|5.0|An old standard but always fun.  My favorite way to relax by playing it.  Easy to play and just fun fun fun!!!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|3 of my favorite songs are on the bonus disc.if i based the album on the 8 song version id give it a 3 1/2.dear father is alright as loner is ok.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I loved how the author wove the details of her life in and out of her hiking experience.  I thought it was very well written.
B000KADH2S|5.0|This is the most life changing novel that I have ever read. Anyone going through tough times should make a concerted effort to read this book and to pray and meditate on its wisdom.
B0055B7IPE|4.0|The beginning will make you cry. The end will make you smile. Some of the middle is a little hard to follow.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|Memphis Belle is good movie!! this is like Teamwork. I don't see any problem with shipping, box, DVD and etc.
B008469DGY|5.0|Just good laid back fun. Easy to use. it's like golf on steroids and mind control. I would highly recommend
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This is the best album in years a must have for Rod Stewart fans.  I hope he keeps them coming!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is a great show. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys sci-fi and/or crime shows, it's a neat combination of both.
B001I13PM0|4.0|We saw Yanni Live in concert a few years ago and this was almost as good as being there again.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey Stirling's album is completely amazing. One of the best albums I've bought. Very talented violinist, and always a joy to listen to.
0307744434|3.0|An enjoyable story for adults that's full of the magic and happy mystery of a fairy-tale circus come to life in the real world.<br /><br />The story is built on fantasy involving all manner of unrealistic feats, the circus itself lives by magic. Spells and charms and tarot reading are integral to the story, but all is so fantastical that it begs to be enjoyed as a story and nothing more. And as a story it is well told, the circus comes to life around us.<br /><br />The romance is purely driven by emotion and attraction, heightened in this case by the magical powers of the two involved. This gives their mutual attraction the twilight effect, when they are together energy stirs, the temperature rises, chandeliers rattle... and it's a pity that one short scene takes it even further. Yet the whole story is not saturated with this romance as was Twilight.<br /><br />There is little depth, and any allusion to a deeper battle between chaos and order is drowned out by the more superficial entertainment. If, for adult readers, the whole is not taken seriously but as a simple escape and nothing more, it's a relatively enjoyable fable. And though the epilogue tries to apply its theme to life as a whole, claiming that good and evil are no longer clear and simple but blurred and complex, there is not sufficient argument throughout the story, and far too much preoccupation with characters and magical display for it to even be remembered, let alone taken seriously. Yet it would probably not be helpful for younger readers.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Perhaps the best compound for your money.  Even if you use it with your stock heatsink you will see a decent temperature difference;  I would not use anything else.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this app.  It was challenging enough to keep me interested, but not so challenging I couldn't pick it up anytime to play it.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|I couldn't stop myself from watching. Every night was difficult for me to sleep because there was more episodes to watch on amazon prime. Who doesn't like shows about survival? Life seems interesting outside civilization especially after watching Lost.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|I enjoy bruce willis's die hard movies.  I especially enjoyed the father son relationship in his movie, it's not mushy.  Their banters fits their relationship.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|Very frustrating to use.  Easy to compose, but difficult to find the document afterwards. WILL NOT PRINT.  WONT ALLOW ME TO ADD A PRINTRR
B005LAIIKI|5.0|i loved this movie, the story is original, and i loved the action.it's a unique black slavery movie. It's more of a black sla very fantasy
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I watched the entire first season in under 24 hours.. so addicting!  I had previously seen seasons 3,4, and 5 but had missed the first few seasons - can't wait to catch up!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|i originally bought this dvd because it was an oscar noiminee.  It's a very emotional movie and I like the outcome of this movie.
B00BQHA06A|5.0|I have been an avid HIM follower since Razorblade Romance, and after hearing that album I immediately started buying any HIM albums that I could find. I really connected with this band, and have found that the last couple of albums, Venus Doom and Screamworks, just felt &#34;off&#34; to me. Going back and listening to Venus Doom, I am able to connect with it a little more than I did at the time when it first came out, but it took me a long time to connect with the songs on Screamworks. When I first heard the singles Tears On Tape and All Lips Go Blue, something in me sighed, and felt like HIM had returned. I immediately connected with this album. It is to date my favorite since And Love Said No. Some of the songs still feel a little popish, such as All Lips Go Blue, but the album in a whole is very well done and to me a return to the HIM I loved and adored. Haven't felt that way since Dark Light, so I am very pleased.
B0072GPPNC|5.0|I saw his movie more than once and decided to own it.  I am not disappointed.  I can see this movie anytime now.
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|Star Trek IV &#34;The Voyage Home&#34; a long-time favorite watched recently at Amazon Instant Prime Videos.  Every member of the crew is in a &#34;crisis mode&#34; in their lives and the story of their journey initiated by the need to return to the 1990s to recover and bring back humpback whales in order to save the planet is absorbing, with never a dull moment - along with lots of &#34;Strak Trek&#34; wonders and many humorous moments.  Of course, it's also good for me to see again Brock Peters as one of the officers commanding the situation as the crisis unfolds, I worked with him in a production of &#34;Lost in the Stars&#34; in Beverly Hills a long time ago.- 1962 - I do not desire to return, although those were great times for all of us!
B006FE83U4|5.0|Originallyi  thought i saw this movie , but found out I never saw it. The story is very good.  Peck did a wonderful job as a father image.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Paper Towns is yet another fabulous novel by John Green. It contains humor, romance, mystery, and JUST READ IT ALREADY!<br />DFTBA XD
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|this movie is different.  We view the present, past  & future and somehow managed to end up with the same story.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The iPad version is beautiful and works great. The Android version is mediocre at best. Maps don't update well. UI is very basic. Why can't the Android version be just as nice and work just as well as the iPad version?  I'm annoyed with companies that put less time into Android development compared to iOS.
0871164566|4.0|This has excellent ideas for using simple materials to create beautiful and affordable pendants.  I would have given it 5 stars if it would have included more pendants and ideas.  Overall, it is worth buying for the price.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|I always enjoy this type of movie. It shows the other side of the soldier in a positive and effective way.
B001DPC52C|5.0|WT is a great band, and this 'mega-staged' show is something to behold. The bonus material is fun to watch also. The 5.1 sound is amazing to experience.  If you like the band, you'll like this DVD/CD combo. And used for $15 didn't hurt either!
B00D2K40WY|1.0|It is an OK game but is gets old after a wile but when I gust got it it was so fun
630542845X|2.0|I received this movie on time, and was anxious to see the movie. I saw about a 1/4 of it, was getting interested in it, when the voice stopped working. I sent back the DVD, and wanted another one, but I wasn't offered one, I could only get a refund.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|As it turns out, the poor reviews had more to do with different formats on the various DVDs.  That explains a lot because this movie was awesome! I am not disappointed by the fact that I bought it because I will be watching it again  and again. I just love the Oz stories, from the original to the Wicked musical and the Tin Man mini-series. I also love Frank Baum's The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus. I hope to read the Oz books soon. I am really looking forward to the next movie!
1435122968|5.0|I read the other customer reviews before choosing to buy it, and I must say I am thoroughly satisfied with what I got. The pages were crisp, silver-edged and contained absolutely no grammatical errors on any page. It was the newer, purple bookmark edition and came wrapped in a plastic wrap. As promised, it contains all of Lovecrafts written works without the additions of other authors, but inevitably I ended up purchasing the extras. This has been worth the price and an excellent gateway to the Cthulhu mythos.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Great Movie gave a whole different spin on Hansel and Gretel!! Love it would watch it again. Love all the twist to it!!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book is as good as the first and the way it is written just keeps you going,  you have you find out what happened to the other people when he changes viewpoint.<br /><br />Well written
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is not a book I would normally pick but my book club chose it & I thought it was very an incredible read. It was a compelling story on several levels & It's the kind of book you don't don't want to put down.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a great book to understand your love language and that of your partner/spouse/signigicant other.  Understanding this will strengthen your relationship and help to understand why people act the way they do in relationships.<br /><br />Very worth the read.
B009K86D86|4.0|I thought the interviews with actual farmers/growers was particularly interesting.  As was the fact that neither Perdue, Smithfield or Tysons would be interviewed for this documentary.  Very telling.  Everyone should watch and form your own opinions.
0763644765|5.0|This book seemed a little boring to me....but my daughter loves it and that is what matters! She reads it on the potty and loves the pictures.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|lived up to my expectations after reading the book.  like the book, fun and effortless.  a guilty pleasure.  recommended if you like the series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy this game - rather like the seek &amp; find games, without the central story line.  Highly recommend this game!
B00C7O8TSM|4.0|It was nice to see the concert CD available, but once again, whoever was responsible for the content dropped the ball...for example, how do you include &#34;All This Is That&#34; and &#34;Pet Sounds&#34; then leave out &#34;Don't Worry Baby&#34; ?  The CD went as far as to include 40 tracks, why not make the package a 3-CD issue and sell the whole show ?
B007SGM084|5.0|I like the descriptions it makes you to picture the scene on your head and pretends in certain way that you are &#34;Anastasia&#34;. Also, I love the general concept of the story, I think many people has lived in a certain point of their lives.
0062086529|5.0|My favorite children's book. Loved it as a child and now share it with children and grandchildren. Written in the year my father was born!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this look. I can't wait for the next one in July to come out!!  I never wanted to put this book down.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It's just like bejeweled, so I can't complain. It's a fun game with a lot of games to choose from.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|It has worked by way of protection.  Nice product.  Although, the stand is not very sturdy so be careful.  It was worth it.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|It's Great for New or Whatever you want i mean Really!!  You can find the things You want to read about
B004X6PRO6|4.0|A thrilling, captivating and informative read.  This book gave me incite into a culture I only imagined and about which I discovered I was ignorant.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. I use it everyday and love the interface.  If you are looking for a weather app this is the app for you.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|I think it is easy to use and helpful, but I wish it told you how much longer you have to be on your device, and were a bit more precise in the description, but other than that, I think it is fabulous!
B00CUWKHVI|4.0|I'm a big Jamie Cullum fan and this album gives us more of the what we love.  Which is not a bad thing.  There are enough unique tracks to keep you interested, however many of the tracks feel like direct knock-offs of tracks from his previous album The Pursuit.  Again, not a bad thing, but definitely up til now each album was so different and fresh from the last I feel he may have fallen into the inevitable &#34;rut&#34; that artists get into after becoming successful.  Keep innovating Jamie, and I'll keep coming back for more!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games I ever played except that it gives you apps before it other than n that the game is awesome:) :) :) :) :) :) :) 8-)
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Easy informative reading.  a real insight to  an American  Hero.  A book not just for Gun advocates, but for  All Patriotic  citizens.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I was just playing the game and the controls stop working! I had to abandon my teammate FIX THIS!<br />It's still the best game GAME LOFT have made<br />I still recommend you get this game!<br /><br />ALL 5 STARZ!
B00000ILBK|4.0|The reason I have this movie is because of the connection with Star Trek - wanted to have the whole series and it does go along with the transitions from one to another.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 3 year old loves it! Easy enough for her to play but fun enough for mom as well. We love it. Now I wish there were a dinosaur one to make  My son happy!
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Josh Homme is back on track with a collection of songs reminiscent of the first 4 albums!<br /><br />Great melodies, funky textures; Josh has matured in his vocal style sounding downright Bowiesque! The album has a slight jazz feel to it even but there's no mistaking the GREAT guitar hero licks that make Homme one of the BEST!
8866137626|4.0|I gave this one four stars rather than three because the price essentially gave me a free notebook since it included three free months of Evernote Premium.  I have found that I do not like it when I need to take extensive meeting notes.  But it is a quality POCKET notebook.<br /><br />This is so small that it does not lay as flat as I expected or hoped.  This makes it somewhat awkward for taking pictures of pages with my Evernote app to upload content to my Evernote account.  Pages rarely lay flat, so I adapt by tilting the camera to match the angle of the paper.  This means I need to leave some margin around all edges, making the usable space of the paper even smaller.  I also find that the spacing of the squares is smaller than I can clearly and carefully write, so I use the lines as guidelines but typically write at 1.5-line spacing.  But it is effective, and text recognition is good.  I just use it for smaller notes now, such as phone calls.<br /><br />The advantage of the small size is that I can carry it in the pocket of my sport coat, so I have a good notebook handy when needed during breaks at conferences or business meetings when the rest of my materials are back at my seat.  After 6-8 weeks of use, it does not show wear of the cover or the elastic band, which is excellent.<br /><br />So for a pocket notebook for short notes and three months of Evernote Premium included, I can recommend this.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl is a rockstar - this book should be required reading for all women and men who believe in the advancement of women in the workplace. GO GIRL!
0937381888|5.0|This book is an excellent step to the next level for the average beginning home-brewer. I began my forays into the world of home-brewing like many of you, with Charlie Papazian's &#34;The Complete Joy of Homebrewing&#34;, with a great deal of success. &#34;How to Brew&#34; reads more into the science of fermentation, and provides all brewers, from novice to advanced, the necessary information to be able to manipulate the brewing process and brew pro-quality beer at home. After having digested both books, I can't imagine two better references to have by my side as I brew my next batch.<br /><br />I'm glad I started with Papazian's book, as it is the more approachable of the two. Papazian does a better job of putting the first-time home brewer's mind at ease in taking up the hobby. Palmer's book might do the same for a novice with a basic scientific background, but for a science-know-nothing like myself, may have intimidated me away from brewing altogether. That being said, to make beer, Papazian's book is all you need. To make quality beer, Palmer's book is an absolute MUST HAVE!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a fun entertaining game for kids of all ages I hope they make another game like this
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I loved this movie.<br /><br />I've seen it three times and am still not sick of watching it.<br /><br />Usually I view a movie once.<br /><br />Actors were wonderful.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|I think this game is lots of fun. The levels are interesting and sometimes surprising. I never get bored and the creatures have funny eyes and such, what more could you want in a game called pudding monsters.
B000HKYN74|3.0|I didn't like the one theme Xindi season. They should have taken more time building the relationships between crew members.  This was suppossed to be an exploration misson.
0547884591|5.0|you got to read it.  that's all there is to say.  this is ridiculous to have to say more to fill in space!!!
B000HL0EEE|4.0|Season one was a good start. It built up the charactors and their personalities. The picure was clear and the audio was good.
1401937268|5.0|Very easy to use tarot deck (great for beginners). Great for positive souls who don't want to get worried during their reading. This deck will not deliver any negative messages.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was a very good book it keep My interest. They were heroes, I think anyone that has been in the military would really like this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book held interest with me the white time, the end in was a bit confusing; but a freak book I've  all. Just read it for the second time.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|This was a well crafted, interesting, and suspenseful novel.  I usually do not like first person novels but this has been an amazing exception. His writing keeps you engaged and caring more and more about the conflicted and tortured nature of Walt Longmire.  Can't wait to start on the second novel.
B00CPTUN5G|3.0|A good amount of the other reviews are people taking advantage of the way this product description was set up. Your title should be Equestria Girls, which it is really. but despite this I have pre-ordered it and  eagerly await it being shipped here. If you see other people reviewing it and they say its R rated or its a different movie entirely, they are wrong.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I picked up and put this book down so many times. 60% into the book it finally moved along and the storyline really peaked my interest. I understand the need to flesh out characters and situations but boy was it painful in the  beginning hence the three stars.
B000003TAR|4.0|It is obvious from the sound and musical quality how Kurt Cobain was being affected by his many inner demons. Bleach was by far the best album by Nirvana.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Amazing! Doesn't disappoint! Brilliant as the first book! GO TEAM MAXON!!!!!!!! I loved it! One of my favorite books of all time!
0062235893|1.0|This is not the real Goodnight Moon!  It is only a few pages with some of the verses and the quality of the color reproduction is very mediocre.  I agree with others who have given it one star but it's not worth the cost to return it.  The real Goodnight Moon is a wonderful book--they never should have done this to a classic children's book.  Amazon shouldn't even sell it or they should at least clearly state that it is a partial copy of the actual book.
1469240661|1.0|The author is often capable of well written, well researched, historical novels.<br />this book was written as though he really needed the cash, or lost a bet.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|My son recommended the Harry Hole series. Since the first book is not yet available for Kindle and the second not at all, I started with this, the third in the series. I couldn't put it down. I'll be starting the 4th book today.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Good app that keeps me from running low on battery, or out of it, with the handy notifications. I also like seeing the internal temp, just for curiosities sake.
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|I don't know too much about the Frank L. Baum original stories except what was covered in the 1939 movie.  I don't know if this followed the \\"origin\\" story of the Wizard that was in the books but I had no real problem with it.  The \\"twist\\" involving the three witches was actually intriguing to me as unfamiliar as I am to the original material... if it had anything to do with the original material.  The witches' story is easily the most interesting part of the plot and had the best execution.<br /><br />Unfortunately the weakest part of the film was the casting of James Franco.  He seemed supremely uncomfortable with whatever he was trying to project.  It was hard for me to suspend my belief that cameras and a lighting crew were surrounding him.  It's difficult to root for his transformation, supposedly the core of the plot, because you can't really figure out when it's happening.  Someone Matthew McConaughey-esque, who can play a flawed but deep rogue, would have been much better.<br /><br />I like Danny Elfman but his musical themes have a very identifiable signature.  From the first few notes to the ending all I kept thinking was \\"Corpse Bride\\".  Another minor gripe of mine was Mila Kunis.  I think she did fine for acting but she might have used some voice coaching to temporarily get rid of her accent (originally Ukrainian but kind of reminds me of Northeast I-95 corridor... somewhere).<br /><br />Again a CGI character brought in one of the most endearing performances.  As a character the China Girl was pivotal as a means to an end for a couple plot threads, or getting the other characters \\"where they needed to be\\".  As CGI develops I think live actors need to be a little worried.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|This was one of thee best book's I have ever read... It was so raw with heartfelt emotion, struggles and devastation. Real life doesn't always end with a happy ending. I loved it!!
B00BKEMX28|5.0|I've never heard anything quite like this, and although it's perhaps an acquired taste, I thoroughly enjoyed this albums mix of often discordant rhythms, tones, and melodies.  If you like dark, moody (occasionally ambient) music and have a taste for electronic, you may very well looking at a great purchase.  I'm definitely looking forward to additional work by this group.
030758836X|1.0|When I read a book I expect justice to be served in the end. Maybe this is an old fashioned idea but this is my expectation. I don't have time to read many books so I invest some time picking one out. I made a mistake with this book. I enjoyed the character development and plot twists but to echo other reviewers, the ending was just frustrating. It was not true to the characters that had been very sharply painted, one as pure unadulterated evil with remarkable intelligence and the other as a somewhat pathetic, self -centered immoral being. The reader is asked to suspend way too much disbelief and too many loose ends are dangling.  I will avoid this author in the future.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautifully written story of love and loss. Hosseini descriptions are like masterpiece paintings of words painting their pictures in every paragraph.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I travel in East Anglia, London - and my daughter lives in France!  It's good to know what the weather is doing in all these places. This app is all it says it is and always up to date (so far!)  Definitely a 5 star!
B000002TYX|5.0|for only 6 bucks id buy this disc twice! hasent left my cd player since arrival. very good condition. very happy
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I LOVED the first episode. In fact, I loved it so much I had to stop, and now I'm reading the books. When I finish, I'll go back and watch the rest of the seasons!
B0055S348W|1.0|Absolutely did not work with my Kindle Fire HD tried everything and contacted support who said there was a problem with the driver for my printer. HP desk jet ink advantage 3525 so why sell it saying that it works. I had checked that my printer was compatible which it says it is but it's not apparently ! Get the act together please.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|There are plenty of enjoyble free games to play; so when I get &#34;fooled&#34; by a free version that is adamant I need to spend money on their game, I don't l,ike it. I'll put up with ads. This one got deleted almost right away.
B00CATSONE|5.0|It was so interesting to learn about this genius man Nikola Tesla.  His insights and imagination should be shared with all students interested in physics and science.  The author Sean Patrick encourages each of us to explore our minds for creativity and ingenuity.
B008602KQI|4.0|Very close to the book, when all is said and done.  The actors were very well chosen for their parts.  But I agree with other people who said that the relationship with Rue felt entirely too rushed.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|Explains the everyday body language that you wouldn't normally pick up unless you've read the book. A very insightful and worth while read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The update is awesome this is the best game I love how you can spawn animals and use buckets of water and lava get this app
1439152802|2.0|All I can say is that this book is very hard to read.  Not only does it bounce between characters, it bounces between generations.  I'd read something, say, whoa, I thought he already had this job... oops, we are back in time.  It is such a struggle to keep everything straight that you get worn out.  I read books like this, see the diamond trying to get out of the dust, but get bogged down with poor editing.  Do not recommend.
B001QD5OSS|5.0|Blow is a classic  and a great film.  I love Johnny Depp and Ray Liotta. They are two of my favorite actors
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Every spare second I had I read this book! I think o would love to meet Christian. He just grabs you from the beginning! Can't wait to finish the trilogy!
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|This app reminded me of a website called [...]    LIKES  1.fun and simple  2.cool cartoon like graphics  3.different ways to play      BAD    1.hard to aim (took me a long time to get used to)  2.not many multiplayer choices (team death match and domination)     Overall good app. NEED TO GET THIS!!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|After a long tortuous wait for a third novel to appear from the author, I was a bit disappointed. It was quite different in theme, and there seemed to be too much bouncing around amongst the characters. That being said, I did like the story, and continue to be amazed at the conditions in which these people struggle daily, even in this year of our Lord, 2013.  Major Eye opener!!!! And........I cried!
B0017APPSE|5.0|If you enjoy pre-20th Century drama type entertainment you won't be disappointed in this movie. It has great acting and is very, very entertaining.
B00190OHD6|5.0|I love his accent. I love their chemistry. The acting in this is well done. You'll cry several times throughout the movie.
0307346617|5.0|Saving this book for my plane ride home and so far so good! Never read any of Max Brooks other stuff but this is really good so far.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show makes me laugh and just enjoy the time watching it. I think I will buy the whole season CD.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Can't believe it ended like that, give me more!  How long until  Book 4 comes out? Great series Sylvia Day.
B008602KQI|3.0|Ideally, this would have been a R-rated movie, but we can't have that in a franchise movie aimed at teens.  This project strikes me as something conceived as a franchise before the first word of the book was written.  Jennifer Lawrence is amazing.  Everything and everyone else is competent, if not special.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Cute, fun and much like flow free. Cute how they added the little sparks when a connection is made. Will recommend this to my addicted (to flow free) 64 year old mother.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|I use this on my kindle fire, and I'm not sure if it's my device or the app, but it doesn't load well at all. I've had to reinstall it at least 3 times and I'm getting quite sick of it.
B0081BU42O|5.0|The Hydrogen Sonata, Banks last Culture novel is a well written send off for a series that has been very entertaining.  This book centers around the subject of subliming which is mentioned throughout the culture books but not to this degree.  While in the midst of reading I found out about Mr. Banks illness and towards the end of the read he passed away, a sort of subliming of his own.  The main characters are balanced between the ship minds and members of the soon to be sublimed Glitz.  As the clock ticks down the action and intrigue ramp up.  The ending is a good send off for a well writing and masterful series of books.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Wish I new this long ago.  Great book for anyone any age.  Focus we need more of this in our culture today
B00BI745AA|3.0|This was a good movie but it could've been better.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway is amazing for the 20 minutes she's in it. Ditto for Amanda Sefried<br /><br />Russell Crow is not a singer. Palling around with Alan Doyle (of the outstanding Canadian band Great Big Sea) does not make you a musician.<br /><br />Hugh jackman was doomed by comparisons to Liam Neesons' 1998 version.<br /><br />The visuals are dark and compelling and definitely fit the mood.<br /><br />Worth the .99 cent rental price without a doubt.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Love it!! So sad this is the end. Best season ever! Nothing else like this on tv... what to do now
B0009UC810|3.0|If the powers that be------Hadn't edited this for language (adult stuff) every 30 or 40 seconds, I could give it a 5 star rating.<br />Not even close to the original shown in the movie the theaters. Maybe I can find an old VHS someplace. Disappointing for that reason.<br />If you want to buy it, it is a fun film. Annoying to watch at first, with all the poor editing.
076115678X|5.0|This is a fun book with helpful information that actually works. This was a gift for my daughter and it has changed and improved her long curly locks. Recommended!
B00992CF6W|1.0|Don't buy it it looks like minecraft butt it's not it's horrible<br />It's not even made by the creators it's a scam
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like this calculator.  The buttons are nice and big.  It only works in portrait.  It keeps track of the calculations you have made, so you can review them and check for typos.  The adds are not a distraction.  They are only about 0.5 inch at the top.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love everything. I like how it show you the way. Get this game it great.  I just go this app game I haven't stop playing.
B008ROFVT6|5.0|I fell in love with this movie when it first came out. What I didn't realize then was that there was so much 'comedic' value that it took me being older to appreciate. And the sound score is just as wonderful as it was then.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I agree with the other reviewers who panned this book.  It was a true page turner - I couldn't turn the pages fast enough so I could finish it.  The bible is not a collection of wisdom; it is a collection of writings assembled by a doctor of the Catholic Church attempting to (and apparently succeeding)to define and codify the Church.  He purposely left out many other competing doctrines that didn't support his own views of what was The Word.  The western word has suffered for centuries because of this Book.  Don't likewise suffer through this Dan Brown book. Skip it.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I change my review and I give this product 5 stars because of their great customer support. The charger was not charging my android and iphone simultaneously which was reflected in my first review but they called me as soon as they saw my review and they replaced the malfunctioning charger. The new one is working perfectly and I finally am able to have both my phones connected and charging at the same time.<br />The product is well designed and nice looking.<br />This is the only charger (from three different chargers) that I bought for this purpose which actually works
B0085YOD1A|3.0|I recently purchased this app to see if it was a working app. So far I've not seen much of a difference. Price was great (free) haven't spent much time dinking around with it, but for what I have ..I'm sure it will work out fine. I only downloaded it yesterday.
B008S4FZHI|2.0|Book was ok..not one of Cornwell's best. Prefer her old style of writing Scarpetta prior to her writing \\"the ripper\\"story. Bone bed could have been a great tale with less of the over extended detailing and more classic Cornwell story telling
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Very good version.  Many different configurations.  May be a glitch in some of the games in that you get cheated out of the last two moves and thus the top score.  Happens when the last 4 tiles are clearly free.  Still a lot of fun.
B000JJH5WS|4.0|We purchased this one by mistake, but it was a cute movie.  I try to stay away from the mystical stuff so it wouldn't have been my first choice but with that said it was cute.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|This is a really good alarm clock it works well it just has a few problems one it isn't so loud but very quiet and some times it exit out somtimes I hope this review helped u alot
B0095J0AL6|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my daughter, who along with her friends, was going through a major One Direction phase. As an adult, I can say that they have some really good songs, especially Little Things.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I'm so glad I pre-ordered this album. I just don't have enough good things to say about it. The album is very different than typical Daft Punk, but using live instruments instead of samples just makes the sound so rich. I absolutely love it.
1449410243|5.0|Written by the GENIUS behind the hilarious website &#34;The Oatmeal&#34; this book is certain to save your life. Cats are so sneaky, but he exposes all the tell-tale signs of the feline assassin. A must-have survival gude for all cat owners. A great gift for Christmas, too....
1781162646|4.0|Stephen King's latest novel,&#34;Joyland&#34;, is not a horror novel, and not a standard mystery. It is a coming-of-age story, and an overall enjoyable read, good for a summer weekend. The story is about Devin and the summer of 1973, when he is 21 and working at the Joyland amusement park. The first half of the story spends a little too much time on Devin's heartbreak of being dumped by Wendy, his college girlfriend. Other than Wendy, i enjoyed the characters, especially Devin's landlady, his co-workers, and Annie and Mike Ross. The ending was well paced and surprising. Mr. King certainly is an excellent story teller.
B0012NO4WO|5.0|I have been wanting to share this movie with my son but was unable to find it at the local video store.  Discovered that Amazon streams movies so was able to &#34;rent&#34; this movie for 24 hours.  In terms of the movie itself, Speed was made in 1993 and most people have become used to extreme stunts but, for it's time, Speed has great stunts and a decent story line.  Even though it is rated R, I let my 12 year old watch it since the violence (a few people get shot and a couple of people do die) is not graphic.  My 20 year old daughter also had never seen the movie.  We all enjoyed it!
B00008G8M4|5.0|ID4 is a fun, little movie that harkens back to the good old days of 1950s sci-fi. It's witty, funny, and jammed full of action. As for the logic and plot holes, are you really going to tell me that ants or flies or bugs or plants or women can mutate and grow fifty tall too when they get zapped with radiation?
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|The makers of quell know how to create wonderful games. I sincerely hope there are more sequels to follow. These games are worth every penny.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have been a fan since reading The Kite Runner, and Hosseini has written another of its' like.  His characters are rich and real, woven into a story that keeps you hoping it won't end.  A pleasure to read.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I'm one of those lucky Brits who saw the Beatles as a young girl and was prepared not to like this movie. I loved it so much I went twice and had to own it. Fabulous renditions of the best Beatle songs, amazing special effects (especially the one with Eddie Izzard in it) and the bus tour. The acting and singing, sets and story of the times was so well woven into the movie you'd have thought the songs were written for it. Highly recommend.
0525478817|5.0|My daughter is fascinated! What a good book! She was so satisfied that I ordered another 2 books from the author!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Egnmatic, yet somehow touching.I thought I liked it ,but then I didn't I changed my mind several times.I watched the film three times,for my own intellectual stimulus.I think with a little work Rooney Mara could recieve the Academy award at least for best supporting actress,if not in this piece ,than perhaps in another film.As for the film itself it for some reason reminded of the old HBO series &#34;The Wire&#34;,based on the ghetto life in Baltimore,which incidently was much better.I saw several holes in the plot I think if the directors and producers spent a little more time it could have been a much better film.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I did not like the game it was a disappointment to me.You guys might like it and my kids didnt
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i'm addicted to this game! I like the fact that this game does not have ads in it. I have another but it does have some ads. Try this one.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl is a great read. The author really sucks you into the story and characters as they literally and figuratively screw each other. In the end though its the reader who gets screwed with the pathetic ending. Enjoy the ride, just be warned that your final destination is disappointing.
145210655X|5.0|OMG, my son whose gonna be a dad in October, totally loves this book(gave it for daughter-in-law's baby shower.<br />He thinks it's brilliant and I do too!  Will surely be a read he'll keep forever.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A comfort to those experiencing the death of a family member or friend.  Was a comfort to me when my father was on life support and subsequently died.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I thought this game would be fun but it is way too easy to get first place and I don't even think they give u the reward for winning
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is a solid, functional cover.  It's so easy to set it at a good viewing angle.  This is the perfect match for my Kindle Fire HD!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like this game because I have it on my Xbox and I just love minecraft.<br />WARNING: If your friends have Apple Products then they will get updates before you do. It is a four day delay.<br />But, overall, this game ROCKS!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I liked everything about this movie. I went back to watch how Jennifer Lawrance went crazy during their dinner. Bradley was amazing too. I thought the ending was a little bit boring. So I gave 4 stars.
1577314808|5.0|Spiritual teachings don't get any better then this. I would recommend this book to anyone that can read. Buy it.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Modern and classic at the same time.  I love this type of music and The Piano Guys do it well.
0452289963|5.0|It's the best of the best, I  would recommend this book to anyone. Eckhart Tollee is the greatest. Buy it.
0802473628|5.0|I really connected with the writings of this author!<br />A good plan for relationships!  You will learn why people are the way they are.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I hate math so when I saw this I tried it and it was amazing! So glad it was free but even though it is it's still great!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book surprised me since it spends much time humanizing the enemy. The story of Franz Stigler and his fellow German pilots was revelatory to me and filled in much of my supposing about the feelings and thinking of the regular German military man during that awful war. Heroism is a trait that all humans can aspire to, even those who fight for monsters.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was challenging yet easy and it was fun addictive and I had a totally gr8 time playing it Yay!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|When I saw this app available for free on my birthday (May 28) I was totally thrilled!!! I have this app on my Macbook Pro and it really made my day and night to get this app for free on my Note 2! Nothing beats going out and doing stuff with friends and then come home to my cat and turn on the app to relax and let my mind wander off! Thanks so much! I love the app!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved reading safe haven it was a great romance novel and had a nice twist with it as well. It showed a different perspective of a relationship than people would normally see in a book or movie.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Finished Season 1 now on to Season 2. Always saw bits of the show but with Amazon Prime I have been watching them in order and cannot wait to see the next one.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Writing was terrible, story riveting.  Lots of extra stuff that brought nothing to the story so lots of speed reading going on.  In the end, glad I read it.
B008NW1M4K|5.0|The author describes the person Hitler in communication with berliners in 2011. The German version is using a language of the fourties to show his thinking and speaking, it is using modern German when modern people are communicating; the differences are likely to get lost in translation.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I read all three books because my granddaughter read them and I wanted to see what she was reading and to have a good discussion about literature.  This is not George Orwell!  I clearly understood why she liked it, just sad that the literature does not rise above mediocrity.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|This was a great story!  I thoroughly enjoyed reading on the Kindle.  On to the next book:  A Storm of Swords.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|When he watched it no one was allowed to talk to him.  He had not watched it on TV so I took a chance and ordered the set...I'm brilliant!  Like the way the set is put together too.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|The game is awesome it has great graphics and gameplay! You could add more vehicles like a motorcycle or something and more maps but the game is spectacular!
0307352153|5.0|I am enjoying and appreciating and feeling validated by the book and have a close friend who is also very excited about it and I have already recommeded it to several friends.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I LOVE how all the themes of the previous 12 books are brought into play in this book...some themes more than others...some themes getting a few paragraphs.  But all prior 12 books are a part of this book.  I loved how everything came to a point.  We don't know what is in store for Sookie.  We'll never know.  Her life is always in flux.  We are left with her life in a &#34;good place&#34; as we have seen many times just to have it up-ended.  We leave Sookie in a good place and left to our own imagination as to what...if anything...happens next.  She has plenty of &#34;good&#34; Supes to come to her aid if needed yet she is in a place where if nothing else untoward happens then we are happy for her that her life can now be &#34;normal&#34; considering it was normal until Bill walked into her life.  I for one hope Sookie has a few years of &#34;normal&#34; with Sam before something occurs to shake it up.  She deserves it that is for sure.  I know a lot of people are not going to like the &#34;Hollywood&#34; ending but this reader loves it!  Sookie...hope you have a &#34;normal&#34; life with Sam and no more supernatural upheavals.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Great read couldn't put it down. Wish it was a series! You will not be disappointed with this book. Excited to read more from this author.
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|This is an easy to read book that helps you understand your world a little better. I would recommend this to people who can read, and maybe even some that can't. It will help you not only communicate ideas more memorably, but also understand why you remember and care about certain things where others fade into noise.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I get so many compliments on this cover. I love old fashioned feel and look. It's very sturdy and I have put that to the test! I take my Kindle everywhere.
B009R659L8|4.0|Interesting ending. I enjoy reading about NYC and Mary seems to incorporate places I have known in the plot.  Familiar.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading The Hunger Games I quickly jumped into Catching Fire...and when I finished it ........well lets just say I'm definitely going to read Mockingjay.
B004UXUX4Q|2.0|I typically like any movie George Clooney is in, but this one was so lame, I almost didn't finish watching.  Don't waste your time.
B00594XOZU|1.0|i love kik but i just think they should update it, because it takes way to long to send and deliver the message
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Another great movie by one of the best in the business, BUT .... it did not live up to the hype it received by everyone that saw it before me (I hate when that happens).  Everything about the movie was GOOD, but only one thing about the movie was great  -  Christoph Waltz.
B004I744AS|5.0|This app makes me feel and seem smarter!! I love it!!!! A lost tempted to get the pro, but still have to think on that.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Don't miss this one!!!  A movie for everyone.  Jennifer Lawrence does an another amazing job.  One of the most versatile actors out there.
B00BIR381W|5.0|The Four pretty ladies are once again fight and turning to discover who the person ---A---is. There's more suspence more nerve racking stories and something new at every turn.
B000PY6BBI|4.0|This is a great story.  It is a little drawn out, but enjoyable.  It has a love story at its core, with enough action to keep it interesting.  I would recommend it.
B006JD48NM|5.0|I have been watching this for the 4th time, and for me new details emerge with each viewing. The brilliance of his driving shines though - with - at the beginning of his F1 career, having a car that clearly was not a favorite and through sheer brilliant driving, on the verge of winning had it not been called short because of heavy rain.<br /><br />The film takes you from his earliest go-kart days (from family movies), right up to the end. And in an interview towards the end of his life he is asked what driver he has faced impressed him the most, and his answer will surprise you.<br /><br />The circumstances of his death - which is unanswered to this day, I had  researched a bit - one of 3 things - broken steering column, tires not heated enough after the previous cautionary lap, or a broken suspension piece - seeing the segment of his crash - and one thing I do know - with virtually all the greats who have died in this sport - it was a defect in the car - not his driving.<br /><br />One had to believe, had he lived, if he would have eclipsed Juan Fangio's record.<br /><br />One thing others have mentioned - the bitter rivalry between him & Prost and in surfing around the Net lately, I read that Prost was upset with the movie (he devotes a lot of time in the movie) - his complaint is that the director did not devote any time explaining that their rift was healed by the end of his life.<br /><br />While it is true the movie does not have any footage showing this at the end we know that Prost was one of the pallbearers and he is a trustee to Ayrton's charity fund - so in my mind I know the rift was gone and they were friends.<br /><br />It is a great movie on several levels - the human angle on his sheer determination and talent to get to the top, and a wonderful overview of \\"The Circus\\" for those who don't really follow formula 1.

B007X6SMD6|1.0|For some reason, AWS does not really want customers.  You have to beg, to get ANY information at all.  Then what they do is overwhelm you with 14,000 pages of worthless garbage.  Someone in the AWS ranks should be smart enough to come up with a &#34;AWS For Dummies&#34; type of document.<br />Hey, Here's what you can easily do with AWS.<br />Put the Simplest twist on the great things that can be done.<br />Make it as easy as ordering products from Amazon Retail side.<br />I actually called Amazon's retail side 6 times and tried to get a human to explain all the mountains of useless garbage that was published...NO LUCK until the 6th attempt!!!
B0043VDIAG|4.0|Enjoyed this book but found it very predictable and knew the ending long before I got there.  However, do recommend if you are a romantic!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a very challenging game.  It is a good workout for the brain. Then should you have an off day, all you need do is hit the suggestions icon to help you out. Plus if you don't like the ugly spiders you have the option of changing the cards to a more pleasant picture.  Mine is of a dog. I love my Kindle and love this game.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Enjoyed this book as didn't expect the ending and was thoroughly engrossed throughout the book.  Would recommend it to everyone who has lost someone or a child in this way!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is such a heartwarming show.  It is a great family show as well.  I love so many of the characters on here.  The actors do a superb job - I am convinced they ARE the characters!  Since doing away with cable, I have relied on Amazon Prime for the bulk of my tv viewing and I have thoroughly enjoyed discovering so many new shows.  This one tops the list!  I will be sad to finish watching all the seasons of it.
1595827684|5.0|It's what you would expect from a video game art book. I approve. I would recommend it for anyone that likes video game art books.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|it realy is amazing. there is a lot of flying and fighting and it is kinds like subway suffers except your fling and fighting
0374533555|5.0|Best book out there on psychology of decision making.  Leaders of organizations in every field would benefit greatly from the ideas contained in this book.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Loved this movie! Probably one of the best shows I have seen in a very long time. I would see it again!
B002SKZBQS|5.0|I have loved Stephan King's early works.....this novel was gripping, and terrifying.....a scenario that could happen to any one of us. Recommend highly.
B0084670FU|1.0|Didn't like this movie at all! Probably one of the worst shows I have seen in a very long time. I would not suggest this movie to anyone.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|The title of this product says original, but this is the original ALTERED trilogy.  Do not purchase if you want the true theatrical version.
B003CP72QK|5.0|Loved this movie! Probably one of the better shows I have seen in a very long time. I would see it again!
B00D78J7SI|5.0|Fantastic! Best COB album in a long time, Alexi's in top form, scream on! I may be 60, but will play this nonstop.
0553386794|4.0|Anyone who watches the HBO series should consider reading the book. It's wonderful and explains so much! I actually stopped watching the show so I could read the books and absorb all the action that way!
0439023513|5.0|These are great books.  My kids are reading them and are anxious for the movies to come out to compare them to.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I love all the actors and their parts but the story line was not working right.<br />the violent scenes were unnecessary.  The story didnt click as well as I expected it.<br />It was a nice try as a movie but it missed the mark.
0439023521|5.0|Loves these books.  We can't wait to see the movies.  The are a fast, easy read and the kids were able to take their reading tests at school with these.
141694737X|5.0|The flaps are pretty sturdy, which is nice when a 2-year-old is the one &#34;reading.&#34; A little repetitive for the adult, but baby seems to LOVE it and is repeating the key words happily.
0439023491|5.0|My entire family loves these books.  We have passed them around.  We are anxious for the rest of the movies to come out!
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Brilliantly written book which I think is much better than the tv series. Can't wait to read the rest of the series

0743270754|3.0|Well, why the hell did I order this thing? 900 pages about Lincoln's cabinet? I have not even opened it yet, and it sits here gathering dust two years later. Stupid me.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app is super cool, and great for kindle fire! It has filters, frames, and other options that you can add to your photos, to either make them formal or funny! It is definitely worth the five dollars.
031603438X|5.0|Good fulfillment. Product performs exactly as described and expected. No problems of any type. I would order this product again.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is amazing I would have never guessed that a game would be able to create so many cool things five stars all the way.
0374250332|5.0|My absolute favorite book ever. Do not miss this. High (pun fully intended) adventure. Hilarious. Then go purchase the movie: it is just as good -- if possible, even better.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|So photosynthetic yt? G chucked beez voice and voice is a great job vCard r us can do better to believe
1439110123|5.0|I was not disappointed by this book, even though it is somewhat dated by now (2013). Fine fulfillment, book exactly as described.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun interactive game that makes you think question and try to just find out what you are trying to do in this fun interactive game
B0060AY6FO|4.0|I'm too much of a Jane Austen fan to not like this book. The mystery takes a back seat to the characters.
B007R6UWN0|5.0|Perfect casting all around, perfect depiction of KA's characters--well, as perfect as something visual can do justice to the sensitive, cerebral, richly emotion-laden humorous writing at which she excels. Even Mrs. Jason Isaacs loves Jackson Brodie...
B00D2K40WY|4.0|this game Is a lot of fun. although you have to buy the unlocked item. Not a lot of the items for make up and dress up are unlocked. this game is good not great.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|Downloaded by e-Library loan from Overdrive. Started the 1st chapter and just as I was getting into it, the chapter ended abruptly. Caution on the Kindle edition! Unreliable.<br /><br />!!!!! Never mind...apparently it is supposed to be like this !!!!
B000SEGEKI|2.0|This book reads like a braindump of all the topics the authors thought could be relevant, with from a few paragraphs to few pages of details on each. It would benefit from much tighter editing, and just a lot fewer topics.<br /><br />Also, I find it rather annoying how they attempt to establish &#34;pragmatic programmer&#34; as a _thing_. Being pragmatic has it's virtues, but the way they constantly write &#34;a pragmatic programmers does X and Y&#34; is for the most part not at all related to pragmatism, but rather common sense and/or being professional. A pragmatic writer would skip the whole pragmatic programmer agenda, and focus on the content instead.<br /><br />Furthermore, this book has not aged well. Quite of lot ot the principles are well established today, and many topics are either too focused on specific software, or just plain absurd in their obviousness. (eg. you should use a code editor with syntax highlighting, because that makes it easier to see when you write something wrong).<br /><br />I would recommended reading &#34;Clean Coder&#34; by Robert C. Martin a hundred times more than this book, and having read that (and perhaps it's companion &#34;Clean Code&#34;), I don't think you would pick up anything new and valuable from this book.
B0091LS07E|1.0|Alicia Keys has such a great voice and has some amazing songs in the past.  Unfortunately, this CD comes up very short.  The single &#34;Girl on Fire&#34; is the best on the entire album, which isn't saying much when you look at Alicia's previous work.  Very disappointing.
B000002O3I|5.0|HOWLIN' WOLF-HOWLIN' WOLF/MOANIN' IN THE MOONLIGHT: The dynamic double disc HOWLIN' WOLF/MOANIN' AT MOONLIGHT is a triple threat listening experience, showcasing the inhuman blooze growlings of man mountain HOWLIN' WOLF, ace guitarist HUBERT SUMLIN's paint-shakin' peals and prolific songwriter WILLIE DIXON's greasy compositions WANG DANG DOODLE, THE RED ROOSTER and SPOONFUL. Most of the former CHESTER BURNETT's best loved midnight trawls are present, as both albums were collections of his raw, seething singles (like most blues platters of the era), with his own I ASKED FOR WATER (SHE GAVE ME GASOLINE), FORTY-FOUR and HOW MANY MORE YEARS on a par with DIXON's material for ominous power. LITTLE FEAT, THE DOORS, CREAM, THE STONES and countless other rockers have tackled the WOLF songbook over the decades...but none ever approached the gutsy, volatile conviction of the master blaster himself. Here are two dozen tracks of smokestack lightnin' from the legendary CHESS vaults...unfiltered, unhinged hard-core Chicago blues the way it's meant to be experienced.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE MOANS
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|this is a stupid game... I can't even get past the first level because the car clips so easily,<br />I suggest you use your time to download something else
B001CJJWWA|5.0|An absolutely wonderful depiction of AW.  Acoustically pleasing with DTS-Master surround sound.  Beautiful picture with cozy show.  My stereo loves it!
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|Like anybody goes to a Die Hard movie for a story line!  Even still, this one was way too predictable and too clunky - even for a Die Hard movie.  Action is still pretty good.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I bought this CD out of curiosity after listening to the music samples.  (I took violin lesssons back in the '70's when it was not an &#34;in&#34; instrument to play.)  It's hard to  categorize her music - the closest I can come to is &#34;techno-pop&#34; - but she takes it to a whole new level.  I encourage you to check it out!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book was very informative and very interesting. Overall an easy read and worth the time spent reading it. I would recommend this book to everyone regardless of what type of books they read.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much, it reminds me of life where sometimes we just hold on to hope way too long, but when we realize that hope is gone a new hope opens up.
0740797719|5.0|I have a number of books on color. This is one of the most concise and informative books on color, how to view a subject,and paint it that I've read in a long time. The illustrations reinforce each text subject precisely.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this app its amazing! It brings you to times in antient grease and antient Egypt! If you loved the original cut the rope you will love Cut the rope time travel!
0670014893|3.0|While I enjoyed his previous books more, especially dealing with the cold war,  this book dealt with more topical subjects that lacked the tense drama  of Smiley' People and other previous books.  He is still a good read and I look forward, hopefully, to another book.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|An interestingly written book, easy to read. Good examples from real life. Funny how Security guys were described, just like in the company where I work... I would have wished more explaining about First, second and third way.
0385349947|5.0|It motivated me and showed me a different view if womanhood and motherhood!<br />( specially for stay at home moms trying to get back in the work place )
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I absolutely love this show, it is my guilty pleasure and a great one to watch a few episodes in a row at night in lieu of  a movie.<br />On to season 3 now which is even better!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Wow, a whole lotta nothing.  This was such a disappointment.  I can't believe I was anxious for this.  Too many starts to other stories and other characters thrown in and not enough development of the main story.  You could skip this, go to the fourth book when it comes out and not miss a thing.<br /><br />Gideon is disappointing.  I love the way his character loves Eva completely but he doesn't appear to be making much progress with his own character.  He is stagnant.  Eva seems to be trying to maintain her independence but, at the same time, appears dependent on a Gideon that's gained more control over her emotionally while continuing to be incapable of emotional development himself.  I find them both maddening.  He continuously says \\"Trust me\\" while everything looks so suspicious.  He wouldn't settle for that why is Eva's character settling for this?  She just seems foolish not questioning or pushing for more or better answers.  The story has gone from intriguing to disappointing.  It's always been fantasy but at least it was interesting.  Not so for this book.<br /><br />Speaking of not interesting, the ending was ridiculous.  Talk about anticlimactic.  Abrupt!  I had to go back and check to make sure I hadn't missed something, accidentally skipped pages.  The book just suddenly ended.  Very strange.  Did the author decide she wanted to go out for coffee instead of write that day?
B009WO7NQO|2.0|It took forever to get an update and then the game crashed when I tried to open it.  Then it removed the update when I rebooted.  Not lookin' good guys. It would be a fantastic game otherwise.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I am still reading it, but this is one of the best books I have read in a while. Good story.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love the idea of MP3 music, available at home or &#34;on the go&#34;.  If you love music like I do, it's so great to have it available on my &#34;smart phone&#34;, to practice dance steps, to share the song with someone, someone special, or just for a personal memory.  I didn't know how enjoyable this part of music could be.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|Could not get into this. I decided not to buy the full book and will read something else. Did not excite me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Good but computer version has alot more stuff in it so if you realy want the same as the computer dont get this
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Easy to play and you won't ever get bored with it. I would recommend it for kids. I just started playing a few days ago. Addictive game.
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|This movie was so good.  We enjoyed it from start to finish.  The ending was a total surprise for us.

B00CRS5HII|3.0|I have always liked Darius Rucker, and I still enjoying listening to him.  But for my taste I enjoyed him more when he was the lead on Hooty and the Blowfish.  That soft, easy rock was more his style to me.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Great Book 4 of 7..... novel has so much history about the Scottish culture and medicine.  I am loving these characters..
B008RA3X5E|2.0|everything about this app was wonderful until I tried to use the alarm,  It went off as programmed but the sound was so low it wound not wake anyone up. barely audible, there fore useless.
B009AMAM9S|2.0|This movie has great actors and actresses but don't let that fool you. This movie is long and drawn out. It lacks a plot that makes sense and it barely all tied in at the end. I hate I wasted 2 and a half (maybe 3) hours of my life watching this movie crash and burn (literally). Who likes long movies anyway? You all have to ask yourself, \\"why does the movie take THAT long?\\" The BEST movies are only barely 2 hours....not almost 3!! My head literally hurted after i watched it. IM NOT EXAGGERATING! I do not recommend for people who like good story plots in movies. This is such a ridiculous mess ugh. HATED IT. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because my boo liked it.
B0026O475M|5.0|Cast Away is a great movie. A wonderful story with outstanding acting. Now a whole new experience in Blue ray.

B00AOMR2S2|4.0|Such an amazing compilation of pure a capella music.  Just wish that the beautiful &#34;Titanium&#34; track from the shower scene in the movie was part of the collection.
B0079TQHDO|4.0|I enjoyed this book but was disappointed with the conclusion,.  It leaves you hanging in the air, waiting for the next book when I thought it was the last in the series
B004D23BRU|5.0|I love this movie since I was a kid.  I had to have it cause it brings back memories. Thanks.
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|Again this was interesting and I enjoyed it but I thought it was the last in the series but it leaves you hanging not knowing what is going to happen next.  They could have told who it was that was killed
B00C5GZKVQ|5.0|This is an awesome game! Great graphics and a whole lot of fun to play. It does get a little bit difficult to control at times but still a 5 star game in my book!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game may have bad graphics but it has a good story and it is like grand theft auto. It's awesome.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun for me and all of my freinds it can ceep u intrtaind and doing sume thing for awers.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is AWSOME 5 stars no doubt but it needs more like object editor and world creator then It would be 7 of 5 stars<br />It is worth just 99 cents but I think it should be worth more

B00633W614|5.0|a great family saga. I loved part 2 and am half way through part 3- Jeftrey Archer still a great writter
B0086449YA|3.0|No real knockout tunes on this double CD set, at least for me.  Several seem derivative of earlier works.  Like many of Knopfler's efforts, some take time to \\"grow\\" on you.  Title track is my current favorite, and its not got hidden gems like, oh, 5:15 AM off Shangri La or Devil Baby and Coyote off The Ragpicker's Dream.  Does seem Knopfler went for quantity, to fill two CDs, leaving the editing and song selection up to each listener.  There isn't a musical \\"theme\\" or \\"flow\\" from one tune to the next.  Whether that's a plus or a minus is a matter of personal preference.  One gets the sense this is a collection for Knopfler fans, and yet perhaps not so much as you've essentially heard most of it before.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use it every night! Great progam, no issues, always works. Love the ocean, rain, and thunderstorm sounds mixed together. Thanks!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is soo awdone! it is a little laggy! other then that its awsome! it is so worth it! you can save yourself withkeys!
B00B5HQL50|4.0|worth the cost. Watched it on my way out west on the airplane. Kept my interest.<br />Would recommend for purchase.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|Even though it was a rather long movie, I enjoyed it thoroughly, no heroics, just realistic interaction between a sub captain and his crew.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This movie is so much more than a sci-fi love story as the critics have so termed it. So many topics are tackled in the book, the misconception that humanity progresses steadily towards greater good and that technology will lead to prosperity for all. There are some interesting Foucaultian ideas of power and agency and how power can arise in the most unexpected places, not only in the hands of the powerful.<br /><br />There is a scene in the book which is lacking from the movie where Sonmi and Hae Joo take refuge in an ancient Buddhist Monastery in the country side, it is a beautiful moment of clarity where Sonmi gets a breath of fresh air from the hell that endless hunger and consumption and human predacity has created in corporotocracy. themes of action and consequences are strong through out this book/movie. It makes one think on how the choices we make impact those around us and our future.<br /><br />I see the 4 Dhamma (Dharma) summaries as taught by the historical Buddha in the Nikayas/Agamas resonate throughout this book:<br /><br />1. Upanīyati loko,<br />The world is swept away.<br /><br />Addhuvo.<br />It does not endure.<br /><br />2. Atāṇo loko,<br />The world offers no shelter.<br /><br />Anabhissaro.<br />There is no one in charge.<br /><br />3. Assako loko,<br />The world has nothing of its own.<br /><br />Sabbaṃ pahāya gamanīyaṃ.<br />One has to pass on<br />leaving everything behind.<br /><br />4. Ūno loko,<br />The world is insufficient,<br /><br />Atitto,<br />insatiable,<br /><br />Taṇhā dāso.<br />a slave to craving.<br /><br />If this movie has sparked an interest in Buddhism for you I recommend \\"In The Buddha's Words\\" by Bhikkhu Bodhi. Its an excellent place to start to understand what the historical Buddha taught.<br /><br />Nammo Buddhaya
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I had a BLAST watching this movie. I grew up watching Star Trek on TV and I've seen almost all of the movies. I'm not a Trekkie, but I do love engaging characters and exciting stories. Well, this movie has it in spades. I love how the actors interacted. They WERE their characters. It's now one of my favorite movies. I'm just sorry it took me so long to watch it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was an excellent book, the characters were interesting and the story was easy to follow. I suggest letting your kids read it when they turn 13 because it gets a little Inappropriate about half the way into it.
B009GESJH2|5.0|Extremely satisfied. Owner said case was cracked, but never opened, and you could tell this occurred in shipping. The CD was excellent. No scratches, or marks. Plays absolutely beautifully. I play it everyday in the car and on my laptop!Extremely pleased with the fast shipping and accurate information. Will definitely buy from the same person! Very satisfied! I love purchasing through Amazon. I always save money and get amazing quality! Thank You again! Suzi
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|This game is high quality and fun to play. I  like the choice of weapons and the various maps. Please keep the updates coming.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|it is so cool I play it every day. dressing up princess.<br />me and my friends play it. I molsty use the orange dress.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Continuation of the first film with captivating cinematography. You still feel the connection between the 2 characters as they wander Paris and explore the possibilities if they had met after 6 months.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I wanted this to be MORE: more plot, more people, more insight into this world. It was okay. What's MB working on now?
B003EW4KD4|5.0|This review is for the SHM-SACD. I now have the SHM-SACD and the earlier US SACD. I do not need to review this based on the music as it is simply an excellent live show with the band firing on all cylinders. I will instead base this review on the sound quality and difference in sound between the two different SACDs.<br /><br />First difference, and it may be big for some, is the fact that the US version is 2.0 and 5.1 surround sound. The SHM-SACD is 2 channel only. For this review I compared the two channel version of the US version.  The differences: SHM-SACD has a crisper high and bass that is more pronounced. I find the bass to sound more realistic and less muddy(although I never thought the bass was muddy until comparing it to the SHM-SACD). I did, however, find the US SACD version to have a warmer sound but that seems to be the only plus over the SHM-SACD. Now the big question, are the differences big enough to warrant a huge price difference? I do like the additional detail of the SHM-SACD so I will most likely reach for the SHM-SACD but I won't discard the US version since I really enjoy the surround sound mix. I guess it is nice to have both. Ultimatley, they are both recommended and neither will displease although plunking down around $80 or so dollars for the SHM-SACD can turn some off. Another thing to remember is that the SHM-SACD is listed as a limited release and who knows how long they wil continue to print this version.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|I bought this cd the other day and I have listend to the entire thing probably 6 times. The songs are really touching and she is a role model of mine. Love her! #StayStrong
B00AREIAI8|4.0|As I said super fun games and since it's summer it is totally perfect!  I recommend this game for children.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Britney is BACK and better than ever! This cd reminds me of her pop princess times because this a dance/pop album. There really isnt a song on this cd that you cant dance to, her music has gotten SO MUCH BETTER! I love Hold it against me and Drop dead beautiful. I seen her in concert twice in 2011. #AmazingComebackBrit
B004VFK5LO|5.0|Sigourney Weaver is awesome in her role as a forensic pyschologist and author.  The movie place a spin on time and stress management.  I wonder, how this case would be peppered in a court of law?  There were no survivors, but to face your victim family and friends should be distressing.  Serial killers overstate their cocky pompous mannerism to become renowned. Visualization of the nature of the heinous crime is what turns them on. Their flippant myopic mind influence their selections of their next victim.  It is noted that your past performance or attributes does not determine your future paths or endeavors.  Should the serial killer ever have a future to even consider?  The gentlemen in jail, wrote a book and from his skype video conference one would think he is having the time of his life.  Does an obstensible nuance of ambiguity exist, or what?<br /><br />Well, we all have free will as human beings and only our choices in life can alter that God given factor.  No matter what the crime is everyone has a right to legal representation.<br /><br />I would say that copycat is profoundly fascinating and her beginning lecture might create havoc, echoing a philosophical thought about on-line dating.  Being a straight single woman there were definitely guys in the audience that interest me.  Thank God I'm over 50 and I don't date in the serial killer age range profile.  But in these days and times most criminals modify their behavior pattern to elude the law.  A woman must be very careful.<br /><br />Another must see movie.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|One of the first on the post apocalyptic Zombie genre but definitely not my favorite. A little to documentary for me.
B000P512LQ|5.0|Primal fear purports deception in a very poignant demeanor.  In many scenarios history begins where justice ends.  I am a pillar of the law.  A journalist or a historian may exhibit multivocal verities as they analytically peruse the criminal records of primal fear.  The alluring venue itself depicts the value of criminal records. As I recently read an article that states, &#34;for history is not so much of what they, (value of crimal records), uncover about the crime, as what they reveal about otherwise invisible or opague realms of human experience&#34;.  Primal fear creates a compulsion for me to seek the legal profession earnestly.<br /><br />Overall, If you like suspense and drama Primal fear is riveting and a must see movie.<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />MTB
B003G4W49C|4.0|A great read ,and in the top 100 Sci-Fi books of all time. You will not be able to put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This Is One Of The Best Games Ever.I Just Started Playing And And I Haven't Stopped Yet.! It's Easy And Enjoyable.

B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Ive been playing this game since last year July and i'll tell you once you get start you'll Always wanna go back to see how far you can go
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Roving character narration leads to underdevelopment and multiple loose ends. This book is not even close to the caliber of kite runner.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is thee funest escape game i have ever played! Its almost like your solving a mystery,you're a detective.they're are some parts where you gotta be super clever or else your're stuck.if your a person who likes mystery and code cracking i highly recommend this game. GOOD LUCK TO ALL!!! (:
B009IH0ICG|4.0|I like this item and it is a smaller size than the normal ones I have seen.  Because it is smaller, it doesn't allow as much air to get under where the paper goes and it also doesn't hold as much paper, so I had to try to light it twice, which can be dangerous.<br /><br />If I were to buy again, I would go ahead and get the larger one.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The only reason I rated this a four star is because you almost lost me after the third almost fatal catastrophe. Realizing that there was half the book left to read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|great game, hooked on it can't get enough, you just want to win. great game without the deck of cards
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Started out a little slow for me, but wound up being a very good read; I especially liked her articulation of the dicohotomy faced by working mothers (and not faced by working fathers). Glad my copy is a Kindle edition - it's a keeper.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|James not crazy about in this role, Mila, whom I love, has her cleavage hanging out the whole film and all I think is Meg from Family Guy, did Michelle roll out of bed or did they style her hair that way?  That monkey sidekick has NO good lines or jokes.  I kept waiting for it to get better, it never really did.  It could have been wonderful, but if I could do zero stars I would.  Visually its great, minus the costume designs, makeup...and well watch it on mute! Horribly written too!  It took all the magic out of what I would envision such a great story to be... it was just tacky. :(
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Thirty years after the forming of Megadeth, the band still putting out quality albums, and Super Collider is a testament to this.  The band has taken a different approach to the song writing, but pays tribute to their older catalog with some catchy riffs, some amazing thrash solos, and some poignant political lyrics.  The album is definitely more radio friendly than most of their earlier records, but that does not take away from the album as a whole.  David Ellefson and Shawn Drover's rhythm throughout the album complement Chris Broderick and Dave Mustaine's guitar licks.  I, personally, find Shawn Drover the most under rated drummer in heavy metal.  The inclusion of David Draiman on \\"Dance in the Rain\\" is also an amazing plus.  I wish he was included in more of the songs.  It's also good to see the band going back to their roots, providing a cover song, with Thin Lizzy's \\"Cold Sweat\\", one of my favorites from Lizzy's collection.  While the lyrics in most of the tracks have a lot of meaning, Dave Mustaine's voice doesn't hold like it used to.  In my opinion, he would be smart to find a front man for Megadeth and stick to playing the guitar.<br /><br />Overall, I was happy with the release, and if the band continues to make albums, I will continue to buy them.  Every time Megadeth releases an album, it gets compared to \\"Peace Sells, But Who's Buying\\" and \\"Rust in Peace\\", which I don't find fair.  The band is not the same.  Much of the anger which drove the writing of those early albums has subsided in Dave Mustaine, and I find it a breath of fresh air to see he has grown as a person and as a musician.  Is this my favorite Megadeth Album?  No.  Is it my least favorite?  No.  I think it's a solidly produced, written, and performed record and I listen to it quite a bit.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a very fun game.  It wasn't to hard yet you still had to think about things.  I would definitely buy this app again.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I wish I wasn't cheap:)  Could pay the 99cents and not have the ads but... have them and just deal with them.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I've seen worse but I don't think Barbara looks old enough to be his mom and the whole thing is just not very believable.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I've been eliminating processed foods and most grains from my diet for just over a year and lost 50 lbs but the junk was creeping back into my diet and I was feeling the effects (and seeing them to).  This book motivated me to complete the Whole30 and I feel fantastic.  My foot pain and headaches went away, my energy increased, and I lost 10 lbs.  I also determined that small amounts of dairy don't affect me when introduced but I am happier without cheese in most cases anyway but sugar and grains cause me to crash hard both physically and emotionally.  I felt amazing following this plan and I just plan on eating close to this for the rest of my life.  If you think you can't possibly live without something in your diet trust me you will be surprised at how easy it becomes.<br /><br />What I really like about this book is the meals it advocates.  It gives you visuals for how much protein, fat, and veggies to have at every meal.  If you follow it you will feel better than you ever have in your life and your cravings will disappear!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I was so disappointed. So much money and talent, so little substance, so little heart. Was this another movie made only for 3D effects? You can tell the actors did the best they could with a \\"really boring\\" and \\"tedious\\" script. Be prepared to fast forward...a lot!. It has many unnecessary scenes to stretch run time. It may be okay for \\"very\\" young children, but I doubt it. It's sad to think they did better film work in 1939.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Nice relaxing music. Fun graphics. Educational about reef habitats. The kids love to make the fish all swim around faster.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Totally fascinating!  This book presented factual reasons for getting back to actual cooking with real live food and made it sound fun, while not glossing over the issue that it is work.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the best trilogy I've ever read.  Fast paced.  The writer creates wonderfully vivid images.  I look forward to reading the final book.
B002I9Z8B2|4.0|Wrath of Khan is one of those movies that, if you're looking to buy it, you probably already know really well. Unfortunately I can only give the Blu-ray 4 stars because only the theatrical version is included. Why the scenes in the director's cut aren't included I don't understand. Why are we introduced to a \\"random\\" cadet? Only the director's cut explains.<br /><br />As far as the extras on the disc, they are more than worth the price of the movie on their own.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|very bad no reception see only fill minute end stop,friezing all times.is a new move have to be better and good move for the kids.
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|Arrived fast and on time with great packaging.<br />I can't wait to read this series;  huge fan o f the show was told I need to read the books.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|my 3 boys are 11, 9 and 7 yesrs old.<br />It keeps them so busy...<br />BUT you have to be very carfull it sould not fall down..
B000683VI4|2.0|I thought its a original CD. The CD is in a good condition , no scratch, I bought this with the thought that its a original CD.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Another good Jack Reacher book..said it was over 500 pages and is only 371.  A little short but an exciting read.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|This is a really great sleeve. It fits perfect and was a lot less expensive then in the stores.<br />I would purchase again.
B001TUPKAA|5.0|I love this movie, no matter how many times you watch this movie it will always get a laugh out of you!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a really good book, easy to read and funny. I'd recommend to share this with your friends and family, this is not for women only, it's important we all know this, so we can start the change to a society that gives equal opportunities despite the gender.
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|It is the age old story of David v Goliath, but everyone knows someone whose had issues with an insurance company, so the movie and book allow the viewer and reader to feel a personal stake (even though fictional) in the outcome of the trial. The acting is real and passionate and full of normal and moral choices to be made by the characters. Each choice made by the characters is a pivotal moment for the plot, but also for the viewer as they are thinking of what they would do. A fabulous movie if you are looking to think and feel.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|good f#%$in job guys love it really good. needed more things to shape to your characters image to have the option to be unique
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Everything was perfect. No damage or skipping and nothing was missing. Shipping date and movie was 100% accurate. Great movie. A must see.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|I didn't really know what to expect with this game but after playing it I for the first time I was addicted.
B004EF65QA|5.0|Love love love this mini series. I love how honest the characters are in this adaptation. Richard Armitage does an amazing job as the brooding John Thornton.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I &#34;thought&#34; I knew a lot about the music scene. I was definitely mistaken. I never heard of Joe Bonamassa until I happened to see his Live At The Beacon Theater performance on PBS. Holy Cow! Who is this guy?! How did I miss him and his amazing music? After buying the Beacon Theater CD I have been one of Mr. Bonamassa's biggest promoters to others who never heard of him. And everyone I've talked to about him became an instant fan as soon as they heard his music.<br /><br />This CD is so good that when I play it while working out in my yard I have neighbors telling me to turn it up so they can hear it too!
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|It was fun seeing the well-known characters played by young actors.  My favorite is Chris Pine as Captain Kirk!  Chekov was sweet, Scotty hilarious and Spock more human than ever.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I like this season because I prefer this Doctor to the new one in Season 5 and beyond. I prefered Rose to Donna, but the Donna episodes were very good.
B00A6TYCNQ|5.0|This game is wonderful on the kindle fire so far and as for money  all you need to do is try to win don't just give up and play money just....have fun like this game is as for my complaint really nothing.
B0073COMKW|5.0|Starting to get rid of the dangerous (mercury, UV radiation, etc) CFL<br /><br />This bulb is VERY bright and excellent for reading, computer use.<br />Much better, more natural light<br /><br />It replaced R30 15W CFL Flood.  yes, you can use it in a flood fixture,<br />the length of the bulb was just right for the built-in reflector.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This series keeps getting better, the love and sacrifice between Kaleb and Sahara is beautiful and real as they struggle to find their way.  Definitely worth the read, couldn't put it down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was told over and over again that this was a great read  and I was not disapointed...Loved it...Great and I could not wait to read the secaond one
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game because you  can eat fish and swimmers and the shark is so cool I like that you can by stuff with your coins to save your shark it is just a fun game to play.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This set of books were great reading,such depth and feeling.I felt as if I personally knew these families.and felt their pain
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great brain teasers! I admit I had to cheat a little...lol but it's a lot of fun to play!! I am looking forward to more levels of this game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book did not disapoint. It drew me rightn in and kept me hooked right til the very end
B007P9ELWC|5.0|As usual, I'm blown away by OSI. I completely missed this album since it wasn't on Spotify...but I didn't hesitate to make the purchase.<br /><br />Thank goodness.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The storyline is very intriguing.  The way the story unfolds is suspenseful and extremely creative.  I was so fascinated I immediately bought the next installment - Shift.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I Loved it. I Have read all three of the series cannot wait for the next one to come out.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I finally had an opportunity to see this movie and it is stunning. It is complex and brilliant and takes good while to start seeing how all the threads weave together into a single taperestry that is simultanously funny, heartbreaking, energizing and horrifying. It is NOT a check your brain at the door film and judging by the content of one and two star reviews I read here, more than a few people went into this start studded epic expecting brainless fare of the Micheal Bay \\"Transformers\\" variety. If you buy or rent it, watch it with the subtitles on, as it will make the future-speak parts easier to understand. Sprawling, complex and elegant...and like all films of this kind, requires more than one viewing to really take it all in.
B009EBMMM0|4.0|love to see Eddie Redmayne in anything!<br /> He is a great actor.  Story very good but sad.  It is a great show.
B00992CF6W|5.0|They love to play it!! They can't get enough of it. Helps them to be creative and design.  they are pretty creative with it!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Glad I read it, but not as gripping as I had hoped. I felt it was a little drawn out, but the ending was truly a surprise.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|DNF, Did not finish!  For some reason I just could not get into this book.  Hmm, five more words required and I don't have ore to say.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever for kindle fire so far and there are a lot of games I like on kindle but so far this is the best
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|All of the songs were enjoyable and the more I listen to the CD the better I like it.  I wish there was at least one song I would have recognized from the past.
B008OM0EDO|2.0|There are a couple parts that make you laugh. But overall, this is a bad movie. I would not recommend this to a friend
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Great CD. Everything I expected and more. After 40+ years these guys are as great as ever. &#34;Black Sabbath&#34; should be a separate genre of music, there's nothing like them!!!!!!
B000TETD9Q|5.0|This MP3 album is nicely re-mastered, the sound very good. As for the performance of the Beach Boys, nothing need be said.
B0076DELIG|4.0|As a fan of Connelly's Harry Bosch I look forward to each book,  this one was no different just when I thought I knew the answer I discovered along with Harry We were after the wrong man..... Loved it you will too
B001V5CIHQ|4.0|It is a cute retelling of the classic Peter Pan but more grown up with real people. It did not lose any of its wonderment and still leaves you searching for the second star to the right to follow striaght through to the morning light away to Neverland.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|After being disappointed with the last couple of the psy/changeling books, I didn't know what to expect from this one. But this book was just as good, maybe better than the first books in the series. I'm glad the story was about Kaleb! We were given very vague hints about his true personality in some of the previous books so it was great to learn that he does not quite walk on the path of evil. This was such a sweet, heart breaking, and inspiring love story. I'm glad the story of the two characters spans so many years. The heroine was just perfect. Very mature and at the same time, had a sweet, child like demeanor. Once again, Nalini Singh writes a great, complex, paranormal romance. I love the world and characters she has created. Can't wait to read the next one!!!!!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|May contain spoilers<br /><br />I have waited what feels like forever to read the Ghost's story and all I can say is Nalini Singh did not disappoint.  I was nervous going into the book after reading the excerpt on Ms. Singh's website, I had loved the character of Kaleb as an antihero and was unsure how I would feel about him being the hero...if he could even be a hero. I should have known better than to doubt Nalini, she handled it beautifully.<br /><br />And what can I say about Sahara...I loved her from the beginning.  She is the heart of this story.<br /><br />This book has a different feel than many of Ms. Singh's other books.  The story felt more intimate, true focused on two characters finding each other and themselves in the process.  I can not wait to see what Nalini has in store for these characters and their world.
B00BKRON5K|5.0|This book provided the reasons why a person could benefit from a paleo diet. When you know why you can design a nutritional program that works for you.
B003QCCS36|5.0|Bloody awesome voice, Brilliant and amazing vocals, Beyond inspiring musicianship. He has soul, He has grit, He showcases enough variety to keep it all interesting without losing the flavour. Love his work...<br />This is probably my favourite of Ray's CD's - but they're all great!

B007CIQ4B2|4.0|Some great sounds on this one - have been really enjoying the quality musicianship and fingerpicking. Cool voice and some great lyrics. Really growing on me.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|this movie is the most of a let down since the star wars the phantom menace. what i mean is the movie is shit and the hack director knows it is shit. the movie feels like a monster of kiss kiss bang bang. and is thee abortion of an evil the devil fears that is taking his job. let me clear that the presume for kiss kiss bang bang or for short kkbb, was a original idea and the cast was kinetic it was the direction of the movie that failed it the director of kkbb is also the director of the abomination iron man 3. and believe me if you look past the incredible special effects their is nothing but shit and pot holes galore.

0425263924|5.0|I loved this book more than the 1st and 2nd and I didn't think that was going to be possible!
0425263924|5.0|Here I am, just after flipping the last page, reading your author's note.<br />First was a cry of desperation \\"It can't end like that!\\"<br />Then some brain fuming imagination \\"What about the bracelet? Who did it? Angus, Clamcy, Stanton, Cary...? What is going to happen in San Diego? What about the baby(ies)? What's wrong with Mrs Vidal? Where is Meguni? So many questions unanswered!<br /><br />I understand why so many people did write negative reviews, but they were not about the story, they were about the wait between each book: yes, they will have to wait to know more about Eva and Gideon whereabouts.<br />Those negative reviews are actually showing you did a great job on the first 3 books, and especially on the 3rd one to make so many people hungry for more. So hungry they can't bear it and have to bitch about it!<br />So I did wait a little before writing a negative review about the wait, calm my anger, and write a positive one.<br /><br />I don't want to reveal the story and plot to people who are reading reviews to know if they are going to step inside your world Mrs Day. I can reassure them, there is an escalation which will leave you in the same state of mind of all of us: hungry for more, or angry because it is no coming fast enough.<br /><br />Why waiting?<br /><br />Because you loved the characters, you will wait for the 4th and 5th.<br />Because the story is well built, you will be looking forward for the 4th and 5th.<br />Because Mrs Day have us, the readers, so entwined with the plot, we will be eager for the 4th and 5th.<br /><br />Because after all, admit it readers, the more your read Crossfire, the more 50 shades look like children's books!<br /><br />Is the trilogy becoming a series a marketing trick? Yes of course, but as a reader, do you care for marketing? Or do you care for a good book so intense you can't put it away before reading the last page?<br />Don't forget the 1st Crossfire and the 1st Fifty shades were released at the same time. While we have been done for a long time with 50, we are still reading Crossfire and asking for more!!!<br /><br />Mrs Day, I won't complain like so many others about the trilogy becoming a 5 books series. On the contrary: I will be happy to wait.<br /><br />And pardon my misspelling and grammar mistakes: I am from the country of romance.
0385536828|5.0|One of my favorite authors<br />and this is one of his best<br />great for spy and morals<br />and living on this palner

B00BCK1A5G|5.0|I have long waited for this particular book to come out and i was not disappointed at all. For me it was the strongest book in the series after Hawke and Sienna's story and i absolutely loved it. How is Nalini is ever going to top this one...?
B00BNWWVFG|1.0|This is a very strange movie that does nothing and goes nowhere.<br />Very unbelievable story line the drags on and on.<br />The premise is silly and the delivery is not worth watching.<br />Good acting but the script sucks!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Entwined With You is basically a \\"recap\\" of the first two installments in The Crossfire series, with a few new details thrown in. Entwined With You was supposed to be the final book of the series, but  it has now been extended to five, and a TV show based on the books is also in the works.  Entwined With You is not a bad read, it just would have been nice if the author cared  about her current fans by giving us more than just a \\"revise & revisit\\" of the first two books, instead of trying to entice new readers into buying the next  installments with a story she has already told. I love Eva & Gideon story, but they really deserved something better.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I almost didn't see this movie because my cousin in-law said it was horrible. I thought it was great and who wouldn't love watching Jeremy Renner!!
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Good movie. But  like the subject line, it is very brutal. Like one big fight scene start to finish. Good times.
B00D3V97DO|2.0|I've listened through this since I got it and there are a few good tunes, the rest seem long winded and lack the spark they once had. As a whole it doesn't keep me interested and I found I had to listen to just a couple at a time and even then I've found the album is becoming less and less interesting on each listen. Geezer definitely is the high point on it but not enough to save it for me
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Don't waste your money on other cases.  I've had this for over a year now with ZERO issues....and yes, I've dropped it on concrete multiple times.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is very fun for both kids and adults I think that this game needs no improving it's perfect the easy it is! :)
B004QK5N5W|2.0|Very sketchy and unreliable.....don't try to save money here....buy the newest version directly from apple.  This older version was superseded for a reason...
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Totally loved this game. Untill i could`d continue without purchasing things with real us dollarz. Not fair. I believe on free games we should be able to earn everything in the game. Free should be fair and square ...
1451626088|5.0|Philippa Gregory excels in extensive historical research which she employs in her novels.  The entire &#34;Cousins' War&#34; series is highly recommended.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|I ordered the limited edition box set from Amazon, not a seller, and It came sealed with a poster, a about 40page book, and the cd with lots of nice pictures. It's worth buying the box set! The book has such an amazing story! Rccomend it!
B001JNNDBA|5.0|blue ray lends even more detail to this visceral mystery--would l0ove a bundled directors cut with sequel in blue ray
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Anything with Maggie Smith and Shirley McClain has got to be good.  The acting is terrific in this series,  I am hooked
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I was sent a link to this book and was curious to see the storyline. This was a delight to read as Harold begins his journey with an interesting subplot about the relationship between Harold, his wife and the mysterious character of Queenie. I have recommended it to many others and have nominated it as my choice for Book Club later this year.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I thought this was for Kindle, but apparently not.  I have the iPhone version and, of course, the computer version, but wanted this for my Kindle and understood that it would work on Kindle.  It doesn't.
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|Read this online and liked it so much I got it as a the book. And one day my mom who recently got a dog cam by and asked what it was I said just read it. Page after page she was busting up laughing and Saying I need this book.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Once again, the Kindle app store has led me astray.  I was led to believe that this app was for Kindle.  Apparently not.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I would never return a book after reading it. But in this case I just felt cheated. So you put off release of the final book of a trilogy for months and then release it without an ending at all? I genuinely think that Sylvia day just never finished writing by the deadline and the publishers came up with this &#34;clever&#34; way to end it. Ridiculous and I'm mad st myself for ever buying it in the first place.<br /><br />I agree with others about sending a message by returning it to amazon. Easy to do on &#34;manage my kindle&#34; menu.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Excellent! A life changer.<br />Should be on everyone's to do list. Would make a great gift for a student graduate.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I loved the back and forth stories of the two girls. Both were so strong despite the tough lives they were dealt. I also enjoyed  learning about a part of American history that I knew nothing about.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really enjoy playing this during my fee time and it helps me use my brain. I also love how I can play on the internet and off of it.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I loved it! But then, I am a ardent fan of Philippa Gregory and have thoroughly enjoyed reading all of  her novels. They are rich in history and her tales are intriguing.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Works and charges fast for my Nexus 10. Magnets snap on and release with no issues. A must-have accessory for your tablet.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I find this to be a challenging app that make you use reasoning and logic to figure out all the clues so you can escape the room.  Can't wait for more levels.
B001K3K5MO|5.0|You just cant beat a good ole classic. Its just one of those movies you never get tired of. I dont know anyone who hasent seen it though.
0374531269|5.0|What an amazing tale told so well by (now) an amazing man. I was supposed to see him speak and I read this to prepare. I was blown away by the story and how strong the boys was/is. Motivational and ad at the same time. Definitely a must-read for everyone or all ages.
0064430227|5.0|Great book for young boy -made a nice Christmas gift. Illustrations were great. He enjoyed having it read to him.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Tarantino took the historical mindset of the time and amplified it as only he can. Set when slavery was still in fashion in the south, Django is a freed slave who is searching to find his wife who was sold to one of the most feared slave owners of the time. He is working with the man who &#34;freed&#34; him they devise a plan to save her....if only it were that easy. Some of the language was a bit much for me as far as the racial slurs but, all in all a great movie with tons of heart pumping action and unforgettable humor.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My daughter loves playing this game so much that she now has my son playing it as well. They both enjoy it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The only thing that I have to say about the game is that it was to short. Aside from that it was great to play!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Both my son and daughter get very entertained in playing this game especially when we are on the road for hours.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I had not read a review of this book when I ordered it, so I was surprised by the first few chapters.  Slowly and steadily this story weaves its intriguing web, compelling the reader to read just one more chapter ... then another.  And always the flowers provide the softening, beautiful foil to the often harsh reality of life, and silently communicate those emotions which can not be voiced.  This is a layered story of great sadness and magnificent triumph.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Will not waste my time writing why, but would warn you not to waste your<br />Time with this  one. Zip, zero
B003G4W49C|5.0|Is an interesting world that was created by Orson Scott Card.  I'm looking forward to seeing the movie this fall.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I just love this game.It's a fast pace game...a lot like beekeeper blitz.The only thing annoying is the adds...other than that,a fun game.
0061703087|4.0|I'm an avid fan of Crichton. After 8 of his books I'm quite familiar with his formula (a specially selected group of scientists exploit the exciting aspects of a new high technology before a disaster strikes i.e. Sphere, Jurassic Park, Timeline,etc.) Yet, this novel is just as thought provoking, if not more so! This is the first one I've read that makes computer science/algorithms the main tech (heck, there's even a snippet of source code), although it is heavily mixed in with evolutionary biology, and the result is astonishing but believable because it is applicable for the layperson. We live in a world of artificial intelligence and algorithms - social media, stock market automated trading, etc. They are designed to learn. It's not hard to imagine what craziness could happen to these systems if they behaved, well, exactly as designed!<br /><br />This is not just a high concept, there is a lot of action - what a visually striking movie this would be! I am stuck with an image of a [SPOILER: billions of microscopic robots patterned to look like a human face flung to the far corners of a room, so that the room is textured with an animated human].<br /><br />Read it as action, academia gone awry, a cautionary tale of ethics or all three - the book will stick with you.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|My family has watched this movie 3 times already with no skips or paused from damaged to the DVD.  Great action movie
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|i love this. it shows you how to really take care of something. This is an amazing app for people wanting a fish and for people who love Nemo. It's all so amazing!! =]
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is SO fun!! I was playing it for a long time before I remembered to write this. I just got this game and I LOVE it!!!! download it and try it! Guaranteed to be Amazing!!!!!!! :-D
B005K17RU0|5.0|Best out there. FREE, spot on everytime Nothing better than having Doppler in your pocket wherever you go. Chicken, gravy,, grits!!!
B004ADH1RI|3.0|A little cutesy, a lot stupid humor...all in all, nothing to get excited about but it passed a couple of hours. Maybe when it was new and I was...no, even then, I wasn't quite young enough. Pre-teen, I might've really liked this movie. Especially if I was a boy. Which I wasn't, and still am not. Just a very eh couple hours out of my weekend.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks
B006YC74E8|4.0|Takes a minute to learn the controls but when you learn your way around you can do amazing things to your pics.
B008458O3S|5.0|Got this originally on my iPod an loved it, was so excited to find an android version. I've spent hours on this game and enjoyed every minute of it it. It's just a unique puzzle game with fun new additions every so often with new types of stations to run through, like painting stations splitting stations etc. It's never been boring. Look out for the last level though... it's tough! If you like challenging puzzle games this is a great one to try!
B0066WJLU6|4.0|I needed to use the flash light for a one direction concert and it cut out my battery by 15 percent but if you were using for a short period of time its perfect good.luck for your experience
B009EEFTMC|1.0|this was a fun little game when i'm waiting in a long line or at the dr's office.  latest update says i have to be connected to internet for this app to run.  that killed it for me.  no longer able to play so i'm deleting it.  too bad.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I personally have been looking for this kind of game for a long time. Many people may get tricked by some games,even me but, now I found this third person game I technically can only give it 5stars but, if I could I would give it 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars
B008FRFN7A|3.0|I wanted to print a shipping label, but it did not print clearly enough to read. I was impressed it found my printer though.
B00CL66FEQ|5.0|I usually like more action-oriented movies, and my wife likes musicals or content-free comedies.  This is one of the rare occasions where we both laughed our heads off in a great story that touches on common concerns, such as &#34;how did my parents meet&#34; or &#34;who is the love of my life.&#34;<br /><br />There is a central revelation about 15 minutes into the movie which runs through the rest like a red line.<br /><br />The script is fantastic, and the editing so effective you'll never have a dull moment in an action-packed 90+ minutes.  Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand make an incomparable duo.<br /><br />A must-see for every adult child and their parent.<br /><br />R.S.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|What an amazing story!  I'll never view German pilots the same.  A truly unique perspective and a great read. I've already recommended it to several people I know.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|This is a collection of music from RUSH, excellent music, if like RUSH this is the disc for you, of course this was a gift for a friend who is a fan of RUSH.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was an excellent movie....I can see why it won an award......even though you knew the outcome, it kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time
B005MJFA2W|1.0|Interesting and well studied, but this is not a book - it is a collection of studies.<br />Some chapters have tedious statistical data, and could be summarized.<br />I hold the author and study at highest respect, yet recommend the book only for professionals.
B009VB97EY|4.0|They need to make more of these for women still with a fantastic libido and need to still know whats happening in the world LOL, Was entertaining!
B002FHJ4B2|2.0|Amazon needs to work on their streaming of videos. It took me forever to watch this video because of constant buffering and the error that \\"sorry there is a problem\\". Very disappointed that I paid 3.99 to watch a movie with so many points where it was buffering.
B00992CF6W|4.0|like it saysin the title this game is very over done ( way to expensive)  to be worth but dont get me wrong its great be why cant kt be the same price &quot;apple&quot; app store make their ...the same exact game but apple list it at i think .99 cents or 2.99 and need to updwte it more  thank you
B00C5W3SBE|2.0|We got the combo package and put the digital copy on the computer then watched it.  It was a stinker!  I didn't care for the actors in the movie.  The casting choices were very poor.  The voice of the monkey was annoying and Mila Kunis playing the witch was not even close to believable.  The character of Oscar \\"Oz\\" was too irritating and his new redeamed self in the end was laughable.  So I suppose I didn't care for the script either.  The end was a big final battle between the good and the bad....yet, it was such a let down.  There was no suspense and the actions of the wicked witches were laughable in a bad way.  I do like having a blu-ray/DVD and digital copy; however, $27.99 for such a pathetic movie is way too much.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is the visual scenery and China Doll.  The combo is on its way to the resell bookshop to see if I can get something better in exchange for it.
B001D1SRRS|5.0|If you want to understand how industries got to where they are today, this is a great tool! Lots of information and missing parts are shown here!

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. Good graphics with interesting puzzles. Hard enough to make you think but not to the point of frustration. Relaxing and entertaining. Well worth a buck or 2.
1603420398|5.0|The product arrived in a timely manner and was just as advertised, so I received exactly what I was looking for. Easy to follow instructions even for a beginner like me, can't wait to get some projects started.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book gets pretty wordy at times, but I guess that's to be expected from a neurosurgeon. I was expecting a scientific explanation along with some preachiness, but found this book to not be preachy at all. I appreciated how the author didn't give up everything he ever learned about science, but found a way to reconcile his old beliefs with the new. I think people unsure about life after death will find that refreshing and people who don't consider themselves spiritual or religious will give some real thought to the afterlife because it's not an overly zealous Christian trying to \\"throw the book at them.\\" This coming from a very devout, born again Christian!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This particular chess is easy to play start to finish. You can even set your level of difficulty. I'll defitely keep playing. And for free, what a deal.

B00DBTBHR2|4.0|Branaghs Magic Flute took 7 years to find a release here in the States. Finally we get a very limited release to theaters and simultaneously a DVD at a ridiculously low price.<br /><br />Following the current trend in opera this is the director's final viewpoint - not necessarily the composer, the librettist, the music. So Branagh sets his Magic Flute in the trenches of World War I. What? You are going to play one of the most magical of operas in the most realistic of settings! Ridiculous.<br /><br /> When \\"regie theater\\" (Eurotrash) is bad it destroys the original work unless the musicians can overcome whatever distractions the director throws their way.<br /><br /> But when it works you come away with new insights and appreciation for the work. And that's what happens here. Bragagh and Steven Fry (Monty Pithon) translated and rewrote the screenplay and Fry did the lyrics. I'm not going to describe the production in any detail because I want you to have the pleasure of wondering how they are going to do something. How will the Queen of the Night enter? You'll be amazed and probably let out an \\"ah ha!\\"  I wept tears of sheer joy at the ending: something that has never happened to me with the Flute before.<br /><br /> The reason I'm giving this DVD only four stars is presentation. There are no subtitles. And even if an opera is in English you need subtitles although Branagh does a great job with ennunciation. But it is almost impossible to understand the women singing. And that's a shame because Fry's lyrics are wonderful - witty and funny.<br /> Second there is a minimum of packaging. Not even an insert of a cast list. And why are these people putting the cast lists at the very end of the DVD rather than at the beginning where they always identify the director and conductor. Most singers unknown but really good singing actors. True, the only name in the cast is Rene Pape who steals the show as Sarastro. But I do think some of these singers will become famous soon.<br /> Get it or rent it. Amazon is renting it and selling for $15. Don't miss it.r /> Get it or rent it.

B004KPX4W2|4.0|Great familiar cast, in appropriate rolls. Great Escape from reality. Good Action. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Going to play it for friends.
B00CBSYDSE|5.0|These guys deserve all the support given, then some. It really is there best work, the tunes are what make this group just fly ,takes you to piece of mind, of concentration.(Hard Work) Azmazin work. Best Music Period
B00CHILW64|5.0|Well made inspiring movie. Holds your attention and has you on edge . You will find yourself rooting  for the children to do this or that in order to come to a good ending.
B005T87QCI|3.0|The game is great and fun. Both I and my son enjoy it a lot. What I don't like is the fact I have to pay .99 cents each to get new characters. In the end you went from paying 1.99 to almost 12.99 for this game. I am a firm believer that if you pay for and app, you should get the WHOLE game.
B00ADLCC9I|3.0|pros:<br />- gaming tablet with physical controls<br />- button mapping software is really good<br />- price is good<br />- build quality and finish is good, nice box and manuals as well.<br />- sleek and light weight<br />- no in game lags.<br /><br />cons:<br />- poor battery life (around 2 hours)<br />- bad wifi module (on pc I get 3mbps downspeed but on tablet it goes no more than 700kbps)<br />- very lowspeed storage memory. Mutlitasking is a pain.<br />- the storage can be expanded but cannot be used for applications<br />- screen is just ok, not crisp also has bad viewing angles<br />- many good games are not supported on this tablet as per play store<br />- horrendous booting time. takes about 3 minutes to turn on and get to home screen (I guess due to low speed storage memory).<br /><br />other thoughts:<br />its a ok tablet, doesn't disappoint considering the price. With little fixes this could have been really awesome tablet and I would have happily paid extra 50 bucks for those, but it is too late to complain. I hope archos reads it and improves the tablet.<br /><br />So, after few months of usage, I guess I should update the review:<br />- The battery problem is solved by buying an external batter which is pocket sized and offers a quick charge and can be used with other electronics as well. So with about 40 bucks I can get 13 hours of run time now, so that is a must buy.<br />- I am in love with the button mapping software and it is really useful in mostly all games which support static controls.<br />- Boot time is still bad, and uneven, variates between 3 - 6 minutes.<br />- Mutitasking is still pain, if there is stuff downloading, every thing which uses internet slows down, i don't if it is wifi module or memory module. Definitely waiting for an update which could solve this issue.<br /><br />Since the price is reduces, I would now recommend it.<br /><br />consider 3 stars as 3.5
B003QS9TKU|5.0|As lifelong fan of Disney art I've held good memories of this film, since the first time our family watched it at the drive-in theater. (A long time ago.)  The animation was brilliant and the armor was gleaming.  The Nazis are routed, and our apprentice witch (Angela Lansbury) gets to be a hero even as she has a little difficulty defying gravity on that broom of hers.<br /><br />It's great to see so many of the Disney classics available through Amazon Digital Services.  I'm still impressed with the genius of Disney marketing, after the major Hollywood film studios had to abandon their flamboyant song and dance musical theatrics, along comes Disney, puts the musicians back to work, and creates utterly fanciful animations to accompany their stories.  And Americans found something new the whole family could enjoy.<br /><br />Bedknobs and Broomsticks was nearly if not the first motion picture I remember from childhood.  That's probably my first introduction to soccer as well.  It still makes me laugh out loud.  And even though my play back equipment is superior, it can't out do that first impression.  It's nothing like Hogwart's, grant you.  But I think it's fair to compare the expansion on an idea which fits into Bedknobs and Broomsticks, and Sword in the Stone, Darby O'Gill and the Little People, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  The human spirit, from the oldest to the very youngest, just below the surface is the most magical thing.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|This show is awesome!  The writing just snaps, and while there aren't a lot of recognizable faces, the acting is solid and endearing.  Short of Arrested Development, this is the most unfortunate early death of a terrific series.  More unfortunately, it probably won't get a second life.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Does not work. It wont let me log in to it. USELESS. After over an hour of back and forth, I  finally gave up.
B005F2BBLK|5.0|Great movie all around. Definitely PG so for younger children (<7-8yrs) might not be as appropriate. And entertaining for adults as well!

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|\\"If souls could be mated with wishes, ours would be inextricably entwined.\\"<br /><br />This book wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  It was more about the connection between Eva and Gideon than anything.  And boy, do we get the point after this book.  Their need for one another is almost over-whelming.  It is all-consuming.  The connection these two share is none like any other story out there.  The book is definitely well-written.  We can feel much of what they feel throughout the book.<br /><br />\\"We'd mistaken our ferocious mutual captivation for lust until we realized we couldn't breathe without each other.\\"<br /><br />At some point, one has to say enough is enough, you would think.  At first thought, I did think that.  But one I got to the end of the book, I was reeling with more consuming thoughts on the need these two share.  They are the rocks the hold each other down.  They are connected in ways that almost teeters to an unhealthy bind... One could see their need, which they call love, as being unhealthy.  However, you can look at it as being open and honest with all feelings they both have.  They don't deny any emotion, positive or negative.<br /><br />\\"Cary was my touchstone, my voice of reason, my favorite shoulder to lean on--and a brother to me in every way that mattered.\\"<br /><br />Connections with all of the other characters in this story  become deeper.  More secrets all of the way around start to trickle out.  Don't think this book is just about Eva and Gideon.  It's not.  There are secrets involving everyone is this story.  We get some.  Some, obviously will be coming in the future, and I have a feeling they will be earth-shattering when they do.  Many seem to be upset about this... The trilogy being turned into a series.  But, I have to admit, with everything that happens in this book, I am not disappointed in the fact that there will be another book.  A lot happens in this book, with many questions still unanswered and more questions that need answering.<br /><br />Be prepared for some shocking events in this book.  Some will leave you giddy.  Although, I was happy for some of the big things in this book, I wish they were done a little differently.  However, I am not the author, so that is not my call to make.  Just be warned, this book will make you both mad and happy at the same time.  There are some truly sappy parts, which aren't expected, but I welcomed them nonetheless.<br /><br />\\"For all his polished urbanity, Gideon was an untamed animal behind closed doors, a lover who bared me to the soul every time he mad love to me.\\"d answering.<br /><br />Be prepared for some shocking events in this book.

B008B4KVS8|4.0|When you hear the term &#34;adventure film&#34;, what comes to mind? For me, it's &#34;Ice Station Zebra&#34;. This is a movie about a submarine, its captain, crew and a collection of interesting, if mysterious, passengers on an undisclosed top secret mission during the height of the cold war. But mostly it's a film about a submarine. The mission and passengers are all interesting enough, but the thing that I found the most fascinating is the way the film introduces and explains each area of the nuclear sub.<br /><br />Frequently filmmakers seem compelled to tell adventure stories by concentrating on what goes wrong during a mission (i.e. the spaceship is hit by a meteor and is leaking air, the aircraft is losing fuel midway across the Atlantic, the train has no breaks, etc). While these scenarios are good for building drama and tension, I suppose, isn't it more interesting (especially in the case of a high tech nuclear sub or a spaceship) to see what goes right? For instance, what is day to day life like on a nuclear submarine? How does a it break through heavy ice when surfacing in frozen waters? What are the different stations on board, specifically? What do the officers and crewmen do at them? How is sonar used to navigate? What other cool technologies are aboard - how do they work, why are they there? I mean, watching a crew scramble to plug up an air leak or put out a fire were probably interesting scenes the first hundred times I saw them in movies, but I find them a bit mind-numbing by now. Most films with high-tech crafts never bother showing anything about them beyond simply being filled with people who walk around, man stations and look at blink-y lights (true, this is easier to write than are scenes that require technical research, imagination, and exposition).<br /><br />So, if you want to watch an intelligent and compelling adventure film that isn't a cartoon like most adventure movies, then check out &#34;Ice Station Zebra&#34; and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

B00B4FU6KE|5.0|There's been a lot of gushing praise for this novel since it was reviewed by the New York Times last week and I'm just here to add to the gush. We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is the first novel I've read in a long time that I felt warranted a full five star rating. It's warm, authentic, inventive, unpredictable and a pleasure to read.<br /><br />It's impossible to review the book without revealing its central conceit. (Turn back now if you don't want to know, as it's not revealed until about a quarter of the way into the book.) Protagonist Rosemary Cooke was raised from birth with a chimpanzee named \\"Fern\\" who she regards for all intents and purposes as her sister. Rosemary was part of a grand experiment conceived by her psychologist father as yet another attempt to study the essential differences between humans and our close ape relatives. The book is told in a series of unordered flashbacks that slowly unwind the mystery of what became of Fern. At first, all we know is that Fern was separated from the Cooke family when Rosemary was a mere five years old, never to be seen again. Because of her age at the time of the separation, Rosemary's memories are fragmentary and she's quite open about the questions she has in her own mind as to their accuracy. What's true and what's not? What really happened?<br /><br />A lesser novel might have focused on the freakish aspects of a young girl being raised with a chimpanzee as a sibling, but author KarenJoy Fowler doesn't dwell on that. Instead, this is a novel largely about human family mechanics and strained relationships. Throw in for good measure is a dose of feminism, an analysis of the disquieting relationship between humans and the animals we conscript into service, the multiple points of view that people can have of the same past events, and the vagaries of memory.<br /><br />Rosemary is a winning central character. She's thoroughly fleshed out and feels very substantial. So much so that it's easy to forget you're reading a novel and not listening to a clever friend relating a good tale over coffee. She's smart, witty, brutally honest about herself and her own shortcomings. She's someone who's easy to like and feel connected to. One of the noblest aspects of Rosemary is her unstinting devotion to Fern. She truly sees her as a sister, despite their differing genetic makeup. The way her memories of Fern are written, it's easy for the reader to understand why she would fee this way. That's quite a literary trick for any author to pull off.<br /><br />This is one of those books that keeps you going to the end. The story is unpredictable; you're never quite sure how the final details of the flashbacks are going to be filled in. And when they are, you'll feel a little bit of heartache for Rosemary and her sister Fern.re reading a novel and not listening to a clever friend relating a good tale over coffee.

Good mix of action, plot twist, humor and even a little romance thrown in...but not too much.<br /><br />This is not a serious shoot-em-up...it's almost tongue-in-cheek violence...we laughed during several scenes.<br /><br />Great cast that play off each other well.

No, but how could anything top the original movie that I cherished as a child?  This was a beautiful film with lots of great characters.  I liked how it developed the characters of the witches we loved and feared as children.  I liked that Oz grew to be the Good 'wizard'.  I enjoyed it.  And I recommend it to anyone who loved The Wizard of Oz.

B00DBSZEH2|4.0|From start to finish this is a very action-packed movie... Good stuff! Not your typical nursery rhyme story that you're used to!!
0316066524|5.0|This was a book that I was unsure rather to give it five stars ... or one.<br />I remember reading it until I fell asleep at night, sometimes waking up when the heavy tome fell from the bed and crashed against the floor after I'd fallen asleep while re-reading a sentence for the fourth time, wondering if I'd ever finish it and whether I would consider it to have been worth it when I did. And truly, at first, hating the ending, how it just sort of, well, ended, with absolutely nothing resolved.<br />Actually, at first it was very familiar. Finally I realized that when I first got out of college I had checked it out from the library and returned it unfinished after keeping it for a couple of months. Racking up fines and wanting to give others a crack at the new book, I returned it. And with money being tight being just out of school, that was that. At least for more than a decade.<br />Then I ran across it on Amazon and -- not having anything particularly in mind to read -- the plot summary appealed to me. As did the idea of a 1,000-plus-page work to get lost in.<br />It was big. In seemingly every possible way. Big, heavy book with large pages and tiny printing. Big themes and ideas often given a dribble at a time before appearing again hundreds of pages later.<br />What's it about? On one hand it's like a long Seinfeld show -- it's about nothing.<br />Or maybe it's about everything? Certainly drugs. And Americans' tendency to sit in front of television screens doing nothing until they die.<br />But mostly, I think, about what and who we love, and why. The most sympathetic character, Don Gately, accidentally killed a man by taping his mouth during a burglary and the man, having a raging cold and unable to breathe through the nose, expires through a horrible death of suffocation after Gately leaves him in that state.<br />In one of the conversations between Hugh/Helen Steeply and Rémy Marathe, the former says:<br /><br />  \\"You sit down with your little accountant'sledger and soberly decide what to love? Always? ... What if sometimes there is no choice about what to love? without deciding? You just do: you see her and in that instant are lost to sober account-keeping and cannot choose but to love?\\"<br /><br />Ostensibly the book is about an \\"entertainment\\" cartridge that is fatally addictive. Or maybe why Hal Incandenza has morphed into some kind of state where his voice comes out as incomprehensible and horrifying to those to whom he speaks?<br />\\"I am in here,\\" he thinks while waiting to begin a college interview.<br />But maybe it's more than his voice: \\"I expend energy on remaining utterly silent in my chair, empty, my eyes to great pale zeros. ... I would yield to the urge to bolt for the door ahead of them if I could know that bolting for the door is what the men in this room would see.\\"<br />Toward the end, after developing withdrawal symptoms upon quitting smoking marijuana and falling into a funk of depression, he thinks:<br /><br />  \\"It now lately sometimes seemed like a kind of black miracle to me that people could actually care deeply about a subject or pursuit, and could go on caring this way for years on end. Could dedicate their entire lives to it. It seemed admirable and at the same time pathetic. We all are dying to give our lives to something, maybe. God or Satan, politics or grammar, topology or philately -- the object seemed incidental to this will to give oneself away, utterly. To games or needles, to some other person. Something pathetic about it. A flight-from in the form of a plunging-into. Flight from exactly what? These rooms blandly filled with excrement and meat? To what purpose?\\"<br /><br />After finally, months later, arriving at the end, with none of the issues seemingly resolved my first reaction was anger that I'd waded through and been left midstream. But then I found myself ruminating deeply about the book itself and \\"what-ifs\\" and whys. Which, apparently, is what Wallace intended.<br />In that he succeeded.

B0050G3NWG|5.0|A classic movie that truly must be viewed numerous times to appreciate the filming method and storyline. When one is aware of the comparisons to Hearst and his lavish lifestyle and political shenanigans it ramps up the interest in the movie. Orson Welles was spot on with this movie and his determination to have it shown in theaters was quite bold for a man his age, I highly reccomend it.

0399162097|1.0|I really wanted to love this novel, especially after reading Barbara Kingsolver's review in The Times. What a disappointment. Fowler explores weighty themes with casual and sophomoric prose. For example, \\"conspiracy is folded into her DNA like egg whites into angel food cakes.\\" Great fiction? Really? Trite and embarrassing phrases like this abound in Fowler's book and it makes me sad that a novel like this is receiving such unanimous praise. Good writing? Yes, barely. But great writing? No way. Reading this novel felt like Fowler was insulting both my intellect and imagination. Don't waste your time or money.
1451696191|5.0|Other reviewers have really said it all, and all I can add is my own two cents that this is indeed a wonderful book. I read it at the beginning of my senior year of high school and I couldn't put it down until I'd finished. Charlie is very relatable for any teen of his era or after, because even if you don't experience the same situation, you know all the characters somewhere in your life. Charlie's empathy makes this a really one of a kind book. Highly recommended for any teen in high school or adult who wants to remember.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Well casted and good character developement. i really like the main actors but he supporting actors are wonderful and worth it.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie is certainly worth a watch. It captures the book in a snapshot, and while it touches on many aspects, I'd say it's missing a bit of the essence. Regardless, it's a well-made movie with some excellent acting and good pacing. The story itself really causes you to think even after you've finished watching. Recommended.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Chilling, creepy, and boy oh boy does Gillian Flynn know how to write completely psychotic women characters! I devoured this book in six hours and it just flew by which is surprising given that there really is only one truly 'likeable' character in it.  We follow Camille Preaker back to her nowhere hometown in the boot heel of Missouri on a newspaper assignment to get the story of two murdered girls. Something is wrong with the town of Wind Gap. As Camille attempts to investigate what happened what she has always known and we come to discover is all the forms of cruelty, harm, neglect, pain, and inhumanity that loudly hums under a thin veil of Southern gentility in a small community.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn has a gift for coloring the relentlessly creepy and cruel in her descriptions of characters and building a dramatic tension that sits in your gut as you compulsively turn the pages to figure the mystery out. It's not entirely a surprise and many will figure it out early on but I find that it isn't so much what the answer is but how Flynn gets you there that is so compelling.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I bought this with the intentions of taking a lot of photos on my kindle fire. There was no flash, and not the greatest quality in my opinion. I would just stick to the kindle fire camera, which is what I have been only using.
B001FW58D6|3.0|EDIT: Something happened to the writers, in Season 4.  They lose plot direction.  Even so, the momentum from all the prior plotlines made Season 4 tolerable until Episode 19.  They totally break with the plotline style at that point, suddenly plunge you over 20 years into the future, and become cheap.  I'll finish watching the series anyway, but at this point (I stopped to edit this review after the first 2 mins. of Episode 19), the series has lost its punch.<br /><br />Prior to this point, it can rightly be classified as one of the best series ever made.  Great continuity and long-term plot, hitting on all the questions we need to think about.  I don't want to give away the story, so will just say it's more than worth one's time, to watch and own.  The script and acting are so good, you'll want to watch over and over again.<br /><br />Original review, follows below (based on the first few episodes.<br />===============<br />Got to disagree with the two most helpful reviews in one respect:  the story hooked me from the start, which I didn't expect.  Was only looking for something to watch while shopping in Amazon.  Normally I don't like cop shows, and I expected this to be one.  But really, it's far beyond that.  The longterm plot is told from the very beginning, and the question of the series is posed at the very end of Episode 1, with a second-time-dying John Scott, asking its question:  who are you really working for?<br /><br />The question matters, for in real life the battle against terrorism has many variant plot lines.  We all think and with reason, that the Muslim jihadists are out to remake the world in Mohammed's image.  Mohammed was a terrorist; the Koran glorifies him for that.<br /><br />Yet as in any violence, there are many other players who manipulate the ones actually doing the terrorism, for their own ends.  For there is money to be made in terrorism.  In the real world, you used to have Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq and Libya all jockeying for kingship in manipulating the jihadists;  Syria was trying to manipulate, Iraq;  it still is trying to do that.  But now, Libya and Iraq are gone, as POLITICAL centers.  The Jews are used as targets, but not really because Saudis and Iranian leaders want Israel dead.  What they want, is control over their own people, and they use Israel as a tool to keep their own populations looking outside to an enemy, so as not to perceive the enemy within.  Saudi plays good cop, and Iran plays bad cop.  So the Saudis pitch themselves as friends to the West, and Iran pitches as an enemy.  Both are enemies.  And we know that.<br /><br />All this is something you can learn easily:  I learned it 30+ years ago from the State Department;  it's not classified information.  This kind of information is made public, partly in an attempt to get the Middle East to realize the game, is not unknown.  Idea is to save lives.  Since you can trace the information live in public (i.e., newspaper ads the Saudis took out when the Road Map was explained by Dubya), you know you're not being lied to, by the State Department.<br /><br />Okay, so if you wanted to get 'behind' all this jockeying, you have to play along, too.  You have to infiltrate not only the Arab groups and the upper echelons of the Muslim governments, you have to also be involved with those making and selling the variant weapons to the end pawns in the game, the jihadists.  So you have to actually ALLOW the weapons to be made and used, in order to track down the users.  Which means, there have to be corporations making the weapons, selling the weapons, and you must allow them to do that, or even FUND them to do that.  So there will continue to be victims, attacks, dying which also is allowed, so to get eventually to the heads and lop off the heads.  That still won't stop terrorism, but it will derail it, for awhile.<br /><br />This is all one can do, to fight terrorism.  It's a horrific battle, and it never ends.  If you are a Christian, use1John1:9 and pray to Father in Son's name to expose the terrorists and their backers, so to end it.  All the diplomatic and espionage manuevering in the world cannot stop it.  This phenomenon, so far as I can determine, arises about every 430 years, going back to Mohammed's rise.  So the Christian needs to be informed.  Everyone else needs to be informed as well, but since they don't yet believe in Christ, they are powerless to stop this.  So it's our job to be informed, and to pray intelligently.  So it's our fault, if we don't do our job.<br /><br />So this story angle in FRINGE, is timely and apt.  The premise of its story is terrorism, and how to combat it.  They make that theme plain, from the start.  But it's an odd sort of terrorism, one which dabbles in fringe science, and you're told that, too.  So the series explores the effects of fringe science, assuming it works.  So too, how to combat or 'catch' that science.  Standard big-evil-corporation longterm plot, doesn't mar the series, which surprises me.<br /><br />Why is this series so engaging?  The script and actors.  The film editing.  Timing, little snippets of humor now and then.  Sub-plot twists.  The overall BIG STORY of what if there were a network of terrorists experimenting with fringe science on the entire planet.  If I had to classify it, I'd say it was a mix of Warehouse 13 and your standard conspiracy show.<br /><br />I don't see the FOX interference claimed in the reviews, for Episodes 1-3.  But I don't doubt the claim.  It just doesn't inhibit the storytelling, to my mind.<br /><br />Series is superbly cast.  Good chemistry between the characters, or good camera in establishing chemistry, not sure which.  Probably both.  I don't know how they managed to get the viewer so hooked into the story so well from the beginning, without a lot of backstory.  But I did get hooked.<br /><br />One of the reviewers said this show is the new LOST, so that too is why I'm watching it.  Glad to know it runs five seasons.  Am not sure yet if it's still running, must investigate that.<br /><br />If it matters, to me the purpose of watching series like this, is to think out ideas.  Those ideas don't have to be true or even correct;  they just have to be plausible.

I can remember how middle school was & that's it, I think this author is just like a great writer of ALL the childhood memories.<br /><br />Now I know why he started to write books, because he is like excellent at it! I would recommend ANY person to get this book, because it's just like I remember Jr. High school!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The best!!!! Everyday and enjoyable read. Wish there was a fourth book!  I Will have to see the movie next!
B002NNA9N0|1.0|This film was certainly very different than I expected, and I didn't even watch the whole thing, perhaps because the beginning seemed very off-putting to me, and did not lead me into a compelling story line.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|After seeing THE AUDIENCE and an interview with Peter Morgan, I insisted that my husband watch THE QUEEN.  I enjoyed it more the second time than the first.  We both admired the perfect script, spectacular settings, and of course the quality of acting that Helen Mirren  and others in the cast deliver.  The way that this production sympathetically presents the views of all the characters, Queen, PM, and British public, makes this movie an intelligent, absorbing experience.
B000HF6XKO|3.0|This was an interesting film, in that George Clooney plays a more diffident character than usual.  But I found it fragmented and had difficulty following the story line.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Takes a bit to get the dynamics down but once you do :) if you haven't tried it, it is a must.
B000VI12ZS|4.0|I really loved this movie, although the battle scenes get to be a bit much.  But I liked it enough to watch it more than once..
B009DKFSSM|5.0|A wide variety of songs and styles.Goes from Latin to disco to hip hop~very entertaining.There's something for all ages in this album
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I loved loved loved this book!!! I grew up in an environment much like Eleanor's...the author NAILED the feelings of fear so well that at times I just had to take a break. And I was blown away at the end.
B000U6BT40|5.0|I rarely watch SF movies these days, but I must say that I have watched all the episodes of Eureka Season 1 with great pleasure. I am now almost through Season 3 and I can't believe that a show this good ends with Season 5. What a shame.<br /><br />It's a good, lively show with interesting, colorful characters and events that may blow your mind but which you get used to pretty easily for they occur in a very unusual town filled with top-notch scientists working on their next biggest breakthrough. It's when these breakthroughs get out of control that things get even more interesting (amusing or dramatic), but usually with a happy end to the main characters, including the town's sheriff, his deputy and his daughter, and a few other people that the show episodes revolve about.<br /><br />Highly recommended, definitely worth the price of Amazon Prime for me.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|Went to see this as a play at a dinner theater and feel in love with it. Liza Manilli has been a favorite of mine especially in Caberet. Now I can watch it whenever I want. Love musicals and I need to order more
B008220BP2|5.0|was way better than i thought it was going to be. This movie  has romance but guys will also like it.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|This is a classic. It should be read in conjunction with Atlas Shrugged. Together, they show the importance of  the individual. Both books wre very relevant today as we watch politics and society mirror Rand's plots.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Having a lot of fun playing. I wish there was a way to get more investment paper thingies. Otherwise lots of fun!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love games involving gravity and inertia and this one is very accurate.  Some levels seem impossible to get by but I'm still addicted.  I might be as addicted to this game now as much as Donkey Kong in the 80s.
B00B5QGPZC|5.0|David Garret is extremely talented violinist, he is a<br />great performer and has the ability to connect with<br />the audience in addition his music covers a variety<br />of genres.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This app is a very good app for a bargain I suggest  you<br />Play it a lot you will get lots of things if you play
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Loved this movie once I got to see it. For a long time I was trying not to see it because wanted to finish the books but I'll say the film was a good take on them.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game!!! I can spend hours on end just playing it! it is not that hard and you can test yourself to see how far you can go without failing. :)
B00338QENI|5.0|Loved experiencing this new perspective on science. I knew very little about HeLa before reading the book. Fascinating. Intriguing. Different.
B008602KQI|4.0|Not great, mind you, but very good.  If they had added some more in-depth exploration into the lives and personalities of the major players in the story beforehand I think it would have added interest and could, in my opinion, have warranted the 5th star.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I wanted to like this movie.  Truly, I did.  With the production values and people behind it, everything on paper said this movie should be an absolute joy.  And I suppose if you ignore the previous films, and franchise as a whole, turn your mind off, and just watch these pretty scenes cut together then it can be enjoyed just fine.  Delve any deeper, however, and you might find a story that does not mesh with the series, the franchise, or reality, and one that becomes heavy-handed in its drama.  Warning, this review does contain spoilers.<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises takes place eight years after The Dark Knight, and Batman hasn't shown his face since the climactic events of that movie.  Wait, what?  The previous movie establishes a continued need for Batman, of how this is supposed to be a hero that can accomplish things a normal man cannot, yet directly after establishing that and the credits roll we are expected to believe Bruce Wayne hung up his cowl and sat in his room mourning for eight years...when the death of someone close to him is what set him off to begin with.  The idea of a Batman just giving up is...unfathomable.  Yet that is the basis this film hinges upon<br /><br />So we get into 45 minutes of slogging through this plotline, of Bruce Wayne being a crippled hermit slowly brought out of retirement by a thief linked to a greater plot.  45 minutes before we see anything of the Batman.  We get things like the Harvey Dent Act, in which criminals are able to be held indefinitely without parole.  We get a character knowing the connection between Bruce and Batman...all due to the pain he recognized in Bruce's eyes over the loss of his parents.  We get Alfred telling us in exacting detail the ending of the movie two hours before the ending of the movie.  We get the great dossier of Bane, of how he escaped from a hellish pit to be trained by Ra's al Ghul, a person whose entire organization was a massive secret yet somehow now has a former members listing.Then there's a great stock exchange robbery, where clearly illegal transfers are somehow allowed to stand, followed by one of the poorest moments of editing I've ever seen, where a daytime chase scene switches very suddenly to night as finally, dun dun dun! the Batman makes his anticipated appearance...<br /><br />...and fails to do anything impressive.  Remember in Batman Begins, the sequence of taking out Falcone's men one by one?  Or crashing in on the Scarecrow?  Remember in The Dark Knight how he managed to smuggle a money launderer our of Hong Kong?  Or managed to subdue an entire SWAT team before they mistakenly killed a bunch of hostages while taking out numerous armed criminals?  Or flipping the semi truck?  There's none of that here.  Batman's grand entrance consists of a bunch of people getting all excited watching a guy ride a motorcycle.  Oh sure he punches a guy or two and o hai!  Flying Bat vehicle.  But none of this accomplishes anything.  These things are just there to be there without any of the jaw-dropping set pieces.  But wait, Batman's not done yet!  He also...punches a bunch of guys.  Lots and lots of guys, in an open space, who don't realize they have guns, or how to attack more than one at a time.  Exciting.  And how about that fantastic fight midway through the film against Bane, where Batman turns into a full out brawler who suddenly forgot about all the equipment he's shown off the past two films.<br /><br />And this is supposed to be the better half of the film.<br /><br />From there the plot is finally unveiled to us and everyone goes full retard.  See, the League of Shadows wants to get revenge on Bruce Wayne for his destruction of their base and killing of Ra's, as well as to fulfill Ra's legacy to cripple Gotham.  To do so they do things such as seduce and comfort Bruce during his time of need and take months to set off an explosive which could wipe out Gotham instead of blowing the thing and being done with it.  To stop this nefarious plot the police send their entire force into a sewer system where they suspect Bane is hidden, with predictable results.  Then, to complete his embarrassment of the police, Bane reads a letter from Commissioner Gordon detailing the truth about Harvey Dent and Gordon's lie about Batman's supposed murder of him...and people just believe Bane.  But do the trapped police forces die?  Nah, of course not.  Over the following months Bane's forces keep them well-fed, despite all intention to just blow the city up.  Do I really need to explain the problems with all this?  So the film takes a turn and focuses on good cop Blake and his stay in a broken city, trying to restore order without any success to speak of.  His story is a long wait for no payoff.  Meanwhile, we spend another 45 minutes of film without any Batman where he must slowly build himself to recover and don the cowl.  Again.  For the second time in this film alone.<br /><br />Then when Batman makes his (second) triumphant return?  He appears back in the city.  Which is locked down under threat of extreme violence.  From the other side of the world.  When he has no money or equipment.  With no explanation.  There's big, epic fights, (obvious) plot twists (Talia al Ghul?! no wai) and a great, climactic battle in which weaponless cops (apparently all lost in the sewers)take on vastly superior numbers of criminals armed with automatic weapons in a gigantic...fist brawl?  In which Bane's plot is resolved out of nowhere.  In which the true villain dies in terribly acted fashion moments after being formally introduced. And in which Batman can escape a nuclear blast in five seconds and Gotham has never heard the words \\"nuclear fallout\\" used together.<br /><br />But it's ok.  In the end it all works out.  Bruce runs away with Catwoman, having given up the cowl for good (ironically when the city might need Batman most, considering the state of chaos it happens to be in and all the escaped criminals which happen to be free, not to mention repealed Harvey Dent Act releasing all mobsters back into the world and thus negating everything he accomplished in the first two films) and nobody recognizes the famous billionaire playboy who drunkenly burned down his home, lost all his money and mysteriously died at the same time as Batman.  Meanwhile good cop Blake (real name: Robin) takes on the cowl...without any of the training.  After having not accomplished a single thing of note during the entirety of this nearly three hour epic film.<br /><br />When everything's said and done, this does not feel like a part of anything.  It uses familiar names and faces, but they don't line up with anything we've ever known, they don't act in any logical manner, the film follows no rules of the series or reality, and it follows none of the established themes.  It's as if the writer never read the comics or understood the happenings of the previous film.  Remember that chilling moment when Joker said, \\"I think you and I are destined to do this forever,\\" and you just had to wonder when he might escape and who the next villain might be to show their face?  There was an understanding there about the characters and franchise which went completely unrecognized in this story and the movie collapses in on itself because of it.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|I enjoyed reading and learning scenes and arguments from american, british and african situations. It was an exciting and interesting experience for me while following the well described feelings of the heroine. There is food for thought and food for self appraisal but the dramatics are almost intellectually described rather than sensitively.<br />Everyone who thinks they know about black racism should read; anyone looking for intellectual romanticism will enjoy reading and most people will be pleased with the arguments' balance in spite of the many revelations of racistic reality. Feminists are encouraged to read and probably spread the messages.
B00499QUK2|4.0|I enjoyed watching.  I realized how unobservant I was :-) So... after the first show, I started paying even more attention and was happy I ended up catching some of the clues in the future episodes.  Overall a fun show, and a nice twist on the old Sherlock shows.
B00D3V97DO|4.0|On the one hand it's probably the most amazing testimony of any single band to come out of the seventies and make an album like this; they certainly make a statement that is still sabbath, alternatively, with the hype that Rubin brings to the mix and returning to their roots this is a departure from that.  The band seems to be in line with the 1980s Heaven and Hell band and two of Iommi's solos sound very similar to over and over again off of Mob rules; Ozzy sounds melodically like a cross between Blizzard of Ozz and Bark at the moon.  All of these things are good though different then I thought a Rubin might bring especially with Iommi's guitar sound which I expected heavier.  Song wise they put together some real greats and in other areas play like I've never heard Iommi play, with lots of guitar interludes that are unlike him and yet still so like Sabbath.  In the end this sounds like a great Ozzy album and probably his best in a decade what keeps it from being a true return to their roots his the loss of his wail.  What made sabbath so great was his wail-esque voice that made all their music so eery.  At the end of the day I'm very happy for the result though it definitely falls short, if you consider being the best album either band has made in a decade short.  I'll listen to it all summer long.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|I love Bruce, so I'm biased, but this made me laugh hysterically. I thought it was going to be scary, but the humor of the entire movie made the scary seem so silly. There's a fire hydrant like spurt of blood from a creature eating a man in a pit within the first 5 minutes.
B00004TH6O|3.0|It's a listenable album, I enjoyed a handful of the songs. But this is a far cry from Queens of the Stone Age's harder stuff or Kyuss. Josh is clearly doing his own thing, just don't know if I can follow anymore.
0765325950|5.0|I have read the Wheel of Time series from the beginning.  It got me from the start.  I loved the characters so much that I stuck with it through the slower books and the death of Robert Jordan.  Brandon Sanderson breathed new life into the series and has brought it to a fulfilling conclusion.  I really enjoyed this book and I recommend the Wheel of Time series to anyone who enjoys the Fantasy genre.
B000099T2L|5.0|I chose this rating because I like all the songs on this album. The delivery was fast. Beyonce really did good with this album. I really enjoy listening this this CD. I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys good music.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I just purchased this cd and I must say i give it a thumbs up, and to get the full affect of Black Sabbath, you must first listen to the first 2 albums (\\"Black Sabbath\\" & \\"Paranoid\\") and if u liked the first two albums, then you will like this album from beginning to the end..Black Sabbath is one hell of a band and I began listening to the band about a year ago, and the song that caught my attention was \\"Changes\\" which is on the \\"Black Sabbath Volume 4\\" cd...Ozzy really put his foot in that song..now as far as the lineup, Bill Ward is one hell of a drummer, Geezer Butler is one hell of a bass player, and the new drummer Brad Wilk is a damn good drummer too...One of my favorite quotes from Ozzy is \\"What You Get Is What You See\\", taken from \\"Snowblind\\"
0393320928|2.0|This book is a continuation of the other Feynman autobiographic book, &#34;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman&#34;. While that one was very amusing even for those who dislike the main character, this one is mostly plain boring. It starts in a similar spirits: just another couple of anecdotes about Prof. Feynman - these are pretty good, although not too surprising after the first book. Then it only gets worse: after a few boring letters from Feynman to his wife from various conferences, it gets to the main course of the book: Feynman's involvement with the Presidential Rogers Commission, which investigated the Challenger disaster. This occupies about half of the book and is mostly boring. Avoid the book unless you're really into space shuttle disasters.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I appreciated the  fact that the author did not embellish the narrative with unnecessary verbossiveness that would have cluttered a very interesting story. I know from having served in the military for 25 years tha this was NOT AN EASY DAY indeed, but the author managed to make it a appear so.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Here is a writer who uses all narrative tools to keep you in the moment of this book.  He is comical,satirical,and compelling in his stories.  I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in Western life. His portrayal of Longmire as a gentle lawman is perfect.  Craig Johnson qualifies as a writer on the same level as James Lee Burke---keep those books coming!
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|Very funny at first but is getting a bit too long in the second half. Overall good romantic comedy.  I would recommend it as a date movie.
B0026145WK|5.0|This is certainly one of those movies that keeps you interested the whole time.  You will get so caught up in the movie you will feel like you are there!
B000UAFDP2|1.0|I have bought several Starship Troopers/Blu-ray and none of them will play on my Sony Blue-ray player. Truly frustrating!!!! Got any suggestions??????????????????

B0058YPILY|5.0|What can I say?  We are addicted to this show, and love every character on it...even Director Strauss.  I love it so much that I ordered the eighth season on DVD before the final episodes had aired.  Highly recommend this drama.  They certainly are more efficient than the real FBI!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was great! I really enjoyed it. I really recommend it. I am about to go read the next book!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|this novel takes the reader to different parts of the world and shows how we are connected in many more ways than we think!
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Gregory's CD's are simply awesome! All of his songs have such substance and color and history.. Gregory is the most talented vocalist I've have encountered in a long time.  He has qualities of ;the jazz greats.  His musicians are one with him and He with them and they bring forth a sound that takes me back, make me scat, and make me mellow. The Lord God has truly blessed Him with not only vocal skills but musician skills as well.  His music is spiritual and it hits the soul and the spirit  of man.  God Bless Him!

B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|Thank goodness for a new Boards release. A good mix between Music has a Right, Geogaddi, and Campfire Headphase. 7 years since Campfire, wow, a lot of water has passed under the bridge!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I was in the market for a new gaming mouse. I needed a mouse that fit my style of mouse use which is to say is the antithesis of claw-style. I needed a bit hefty mouse to rest my hand on. Its difficult to find those kinds of mice because it seems most are going toward a smaller, sleeker body.<br /><br />As I often to, I decide to always try out lesser known brands because well all companies have to start somewhere. I also have had a couple other Anker products that work well, so Ill admit it wasn't a complete unknown brand to me.<br /><br />This is bang for your buck. It has the features of a big name brand mouse in a cheaper package. So far so good. I cannot speak for the longevity of the mouse yet because I have only been using it for a few months.<br /><br />Its an excellent product and I suspect and hope that Anker will produce more products and get better with time. Competition in any industry is always good for us, the consumer. Watch out!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Low price!<br />Buttons are highly customizable via the software.<br />Adjustable weight system.<br />On the fly adjustable DPI.<br />On the fly macro recording.<br />braided cable<br />Cool pulsing light (can be changed with software)<br />Big scroll wheel<br /><br />Cons:<br />Software not included in package (helps with cost though and keeps it cheap)<br />Flimsy/cheap weight cover (not a big deal if you adjust only a couple of times).<br />Can only customize the color of the LED in the palm of the mouse (if you care! I dont).
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't believe I have to wait for another book ugh I love this series and thought this would be the end of the story but surprise its not ya and ugh at the same time love that its continuing but ugh I have to wait for the next one<br />These are a must read series for the erotic romance lovers I felt there were very few similarity s to the 50 book they each have a very different  story  give them a try you'll love them
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is super fun and will always make you happy. This is my go to game when I have nothing to do.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|This story was clearly put together by incredibly capable filmmakers and much of the film was quite enjoyable to watch. Rob Corrdry was particularly funny as the lead characters zombie best friend. However, the enjoyable humor of the film was overwhelmed by the predictable and angst-ridden romance of the piece. I left wanting more laughs and scares and less love.
1439130833|5.0|tis the simplest little treasures easily accessible each day to have, read, think about, motivate myself by.  I share with my family and friends and each day it becomes a joy.

0316067601|5.0|An awesome read! You gain a new perspective on SEALs. It makes you proud of our military, the Navy SEALs. It's heartbreaking, uplifting, gives you hope, makes you thankful. I agree this book should be required reading for every American. It was life changing. I love my country & respect & honor our military who protect it. Well done Marcus Luttrell. I won't forget Murph, Axe & Danny!
158270208X|5.0|stunning effective simple precious perchase.  This Book feel very special and it certainly is. thank you thank you  thank you .
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|I loved this story about Ivan Vorpatril, the cousin of Miles Vorkosigan.  Usually, Ivan is the foil for Miles and the other characters, but in this one the playboy Vor lord comes into his own -- marrying a fleeing heiress to save her from assassins hwo are tracking her across worlds, and fully intending to divorce her as quickly as possible.  Except, he somehow finds himself in love with his own wife.<br /><br />There's plenty of action, plenty of romance, and more than a little bit of humoor.  I want more -- more Miles, more Gregor, more Ivan!  Love this series.
B0083Z614S|3.0|The story starts off and continues at a rapid pace. But somewhere towards the end it seemed as though the writer forgot to add some chapters. Like why did Mary never go out on the moor to meet Dickon's mom and say thanks to her? Did Colin's dad ever get to pay her back for all the milk and bread she sent over to the children? And... instead of sending the food back couldn't the children just save it and send it to Dicken's kin? And lastly, whatever happened to the last chapter? Its okay for a child to read though,  plenty of good stuff for a child's imagination!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Did you ever go to a movie, and it was filled with non-stop action, great characters, and a wonderful story...and then it just ended as if the director had run out of film or time?<br /><br />That's exactly how I felt when I got to the end of Suzanne Collins's final book in the Hunger Games trilogy.  What a huge disappointment!  Yes, I saw it coming: she did set up that scene in the palace gardens in the earlier books.<br /><br />But who would have thought she'd go from the anticlimax into an epilogue even more disappointing than the one at the end of the Harry Potter books?  I'm glad I read all three books in one weekend -- I'd have been truly angry if I'd waited a year or more for the final installment and then was left with this godawful mess.<br /><br />What a shame that the editors didn't force Collins to treat her readers with a bit more respect in the final chapter!
B00CWVFVUE|3.0|The movie did not live up to the potential that the book offered. So many crucial aspects of the story were omitted and/or altered and I was extremely disappointed. Since there have been so many book-to-movie screen adaptation's that have been done well, I cannot believe that the authors let their wonderful story be butchered!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A fascinating alternate history about what might have happened had Oswald been prevented from killing Kennedy. I found the possible new history well worth considering and thought provoking. The story is well told and has a science fiction quality. I recommend it highly even to people who do not normally read S.  King.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|hate this book.it is the worst book ever.do not read this book.from kylie wood.......<br />...I hate it to death<br />  do not read it
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Although I feel that Hosseini's previous books, The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, are better books, I did enjoy this multigenerational saga. I read it pretty fast as I found myself caught up in the story of the eventful and challenging lives of the protagonists. Kabul, Afghanistan and the San Francisco Bay area - which I am very familiar with - are the story's evocative backdrops.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I went to see this in the new 3-D format that Peter Jackson talked about and I wasn't impressed at all but I knew the movie was great so I bought it on blu-ray. It was like I was seeing it for the first time. Although not as good as The Lord Of the Rings ( i mean come on that trilogy is and always will be on of the best ever ) it is really  good and hopefully the sequels that follow will be even better. The only complaint I have about this blu-ray is I would've like to have had this be the  widescreen format without the bars.... But this is only a very minor complaint
B005QPMB2Y|3.0|The controls are backwards (left is right, right is left).  But does what it is suppose to do which is watch a camera.
B00AR0DN3Y|5.0|I loved it.<br />He really took us there. Very well done.<br />I wish to know more on what happened with Simon.<br />Few mountain books can be as good as this one.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|There were great aspects to this, and then there were places where it seemed this show was actually trying to be something it wasn't. There where some holes in the plot, and spotty points. I guess why it wasn't renewed for a third season.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|This is a another book about Mickey Haller. In this book he helps Lisa keep her home safe from foreclosure. Then he defends her when she is charged with murder. It was a fun book to read.
1451695195|5.0|I couldn't put this one down.  It's just amazing.  I admit I've had my doubts about the reality of God and all religion.  However, a lot of questions were answered with this one.  I wish I could sit down personally and talk with this doctor.
B006H5120E|1.0|I began purchasing these combo offerings to build up my collection of 3D/Blue-ray movies in preparation for my next purchase of a3D flat screen. I was unable to get the blue ray to play on my LG player. I routinely get Netflix blue-ray disc throughout the month and never have a problem. I sent the disc back for replacement and had the same issue with the replacement. In addition I was charged a restocking fee. I'm done with this deal for now. Maybe I'll revisit again at some future date.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This was one of the best reads I have had in a long time. I  couldn't put my kindle down.  I am now hopelessly a fan. There has to be more.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This is a highly enjoyable film with a great cast that's a lot of fun to watch.  My friends told me about this movie and I finally got a chance to watch it and can see why so many people like this film.  Lots of action and gags to keep you laughing and on the edge of your seat.  This is perfect when you need an action comedy to lift your spirits and keep you entertained.
B00BF8OYJO|5.0|... is by far unique! Such a good character created by M.C. Beaton, she has flaws galore but is always great. This character has become a favourite of mine and I know, of many others. She drives people to drink with her stubborness and arrogance - she's also selfish and intelligent - and her lust for handsome men never ends.<br />She is, however, a very good detective and has my loyalty forever.<br />This is another one of the many good titles that deserve a place high in your bookcase so others won't see it first hand and want to borrow it.
B002QGSW8I|5.0|Bought this book for my husband who is now an avid reader.  He devours the books by authors he enjoys and I am so thankful to find all his authors on Amazon.  Thank you Amazon.

B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I downloaded this and immediately after, alarm bells went off with my security software. This app has a risk of getting your email hacked.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Obviously nothing with regards to this movie is realistic, but it is not supposed to be. Lay back relax and enjoy the twist on this Hansel and Gretel story. Not a masterpiece, but I enjoyed watching it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is one of the best Kindle Fire games . It has lots of cool vehicles and tracks.  It would be even more awesome if there were power ups. Like head start and speed boost.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|This is a fun puzzle game. I bought it with some promotional credit, but it's not really any different from the free versions that you can get.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The only this disappointing about The Room is that it needs more rooms! This is a wonderful game! I can hardly wait for more!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like it, it tells me the amount not just a bar. I have not tried all the functions, like notifications but it is good enough for 5 stars. Samsung Galaxy III
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|Yup, another four bucks and ninety minutes of my life I'll never see again.  Just wanted to watch this as mindless entertainment, wasn't expecting much, it didn't even meet my lowest expectations.  This disaster was clearly intended for foul-mouthed twelve year-olds.  Too bad we can't use negative-star ratings. Never the less, I'll give this a single star in honor of Edward the troll.
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|One of the better chase scenes I've ever seen.<br />Suspend disbelief and just go along for the ride.<br />It's not rocket science.
0425263924|5.0|I totally love being sucked into Gideon and Eva's world. These 2 tortured souls have so much baggage and issues to deal with so it's even more gratifying as they keep figuring out how to deal together. Sylvia Day did a great job moving this journey forward as Eva copes with issues from her past and how these impact her future with Gideon. I can see why there will be more books because there are still so many items to resolve especially for Gideon that hasn't/couldn't happen with the other things going on. I love how we see Cary, Megumi, Mark, etc become more important parts of Eva' life and how these relationships help to shape/make her stronger with Gideon. If you liked the first 2 books, I think you will totally enjoy book 3 and will be anxious for more when you are finished! Enjoy!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a great book, really. I heard other people talking about it so I decided to read it. It was a good choice. I love this book! Suzanne Collins is a great author. This is a must read!
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|I love John McClane, but it's about time he stopped trying to get himself killed.  If he doesn't he will probably kill himself.  This is at least one (a case could be made for two) too many Die Hard movies.  We can stop now please.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I like the app, but have less use for it as I use ebay less and less now. 4 stars
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a great book for older elementary on up.  It's an easy read and helps kids understand how a kid who looks \\"different\\" on the outside is pretty much the same on the inside.
630463949X|5.0|There are so many reviews of this concert, I only want to add, that for me, Christine McVie singing \\"Say You Love Me\\" and ex husband John singing his bass parts; while playing them, is worth the price of the purchase.  Ms. McVie is a beautiful woman; with an equally beautiful voice.  The choice of banjo for this song is bloody brilliant.  If you've even thought of buying it.  Do so.  I wish that Christine McVie would come back for one more tour; or a select number of concerts and please let it be Toronto.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Although this book was slow in the beginning, when it picked up the pace, it soared.  Gone Girl was an exciting and nail biting psychological thriller with many twists and turns. If you enjoy a book that is exciting and far above the norm, you will love this book!
1451673442|5.0|This book changed my life !!! Can't say enough wonderful things about this book and how it can transform your life
B00B4804KS|5.0|If you liked this movie when it first came out you are going to love it in 3D.  The T-Rex is even badder than I remember it and this is a great way to experience the wildest theme park of all time.  Great visuals.  Highly recommended!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Tried many other keyboards, and this is the best keyboard by far. Nothing can compare to it's predictive text. You'lllove it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a very great game upgrading shark after shark, but I recently saw my brother get a new update for the game on his iPad with the giant crab in the crab lair but I didn't get the update for my KindlefireHD so I think FGOL should update the Kindlefire version of the game.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This series is enjoyable. Each episode tells a little snippet of the bigger story of this community. I can't wait to start the next season.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this game is awesome!!  I had so much fun playing it and since I cant take pictures of my friends and family I used this and created them.
0061122416|5.0|My daughter gave me a copy of this book six years ago.  I could not put it down for two days!
B005LAII8K|4.0|Better than most B movie sci-fi thrillers I really liked the premise for this movie.  Add to that a very good cast (Willis, Gordon-Levitt and Emily Blunt) and it is well worth a look.  Recommended.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|When you open the app up, it automatically sets your PE worlds to the main screen. You can select it to change the game mode, time, or set your survival life to &quot;infinite&quot;, which helps when you need to add things on to your survival house to impress friends, or maybe locate diamonds. I once went to the nether and survived by using infinite lives and the survival/creative settings to create the Nether Reactor without mining a thing! If you need diamonds or budder, just switch from survival to creative using the app! Very convenient for a better minecraft experience!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I can recommend this app as a handy tool. I have saved several locations to check on friends and family as well as vacation spots.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I began this book with high expectations, based on Hosseini's previous books. I found the writing style, especially in the beginning, slow and boring. The pace did pick up a bit in the last twenty-five percent of the book, it still did not engage me and I do not feel that I can recommend it to friends or family. Sue Hanauer
B00005JKNF|3.0|Too scattered, not up to my veiwing enjoyment.  I'm a fan of Downton Abbey, Pride and Prejudice and stories of that quality.  This did not come close to the mark.
193700788X|3.0|I didn't find it as good as the rest of the books. Slower, harder to stay interested. It didn't pull me in and make me not want to put it down!
1439153663|5.0|The cream is fantastic..it does the trick for dry skin.  The scent is so fresh.  I love it and would recommend highly.
B001F7MSFM|4.0|As one reviewer put it, probably the smaller ones in the family would be frightened, but most of the rest of the family will find it entertaining. There are no messages beyond the trivial but lots of fighting with a good deal of it of an entertaining \\"stunt-filled\\" character. The story is serviceable and completely forgettable even as you watch. There are even two romances with mixed couples: monster and human looking entity. The costuming and scenic design add immeasurably to the success of the film as does the \\"human\\" aspects of the friendly monsters. Hard to tell just how good the acting is with so much costuming and stunt-doubling.  Put both the acting and the embellishments together as is done in the film and you have an effective  pairing. Recommended.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Got it for my granddaughter but find myself hook on it. Keep growing my aquarium and getting more friends. Can't wait to play.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Such an amazing al!um! On repeat in my car! Love that the physical version was cheaper than the digital version, since I was going to end up burning a copy anyways!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is so cool I am not old enough to have a facebook and this makes it like I have one it Is like the games .on faCebook<br />  B-)
B002PMPTIO|5.0|i downloaded this video and enjoyed the clarity and its availablity. the download was an excellent opportunity and allowed me to watch this video immediately

B00BEU19ZU|3.0|Great app but.....why is Gibraltar not listed it should be in the Europe section I have searched all sections, no listing for Gibraltar, it does have an Airport!
B0057F869U|4.0|There are so many things that I love about this adaptation of the classic novel. Where do I begin?<br /><br />1) Story-line stays fairly true to the original -- I know that movies cannot be 17-hour sagas, and that the stories must be streamlined. Thankfully, this version kept to the major plot points and did not take poetic license with the story. The original was good enough to be named a classic, right, so what makes you think you can do it better?<br /><br />2) Excellent choice for Rochester -- Michael Fassbender is the most passionate Rochester I have ever seen on film. Other actors give R just a little too much of the stiff upper lip. Yes, that is one aspect of his at times acerbic personality, but it's not all there is to him! If it were, we would find it very difficult to believe why Jane fell in love with him in the first place!<br /><br />3) Excellent choice for Jane -- In addition to being a wonderful actress, Mia Wasikowska has the perfect facial features and skin to be able to pull off the drastic hairstyle that this role requires. Let's face it, that middle part, slicked-back hair-do doesn't really flatter anyone. And yes, we know Jane is supposed to be &#34;plain&#34;, but if I wanted to look at an ugly woman for 2 hours, I could just people watch at Walmart... This Jane has a simple, subtle beauty that becomes Rochester's description of her: that she has an elf-like, other-worldly look about her.<br /><br />4) Cinematography is fresh! -- *SPOILER ALERT* Rather than going chronologically as traditional adaptations have done, the movie starts as Jane is fleeing Thornfield. When she is taken in and questioned by the Rivers', her childhood is done as a flashback. The story goes back and forth slightly until the plot-line meets up with itself, then continuing in chronological order. This may sound jumbled and sporadic, and maybe even confusing if you don't know the story, but in actuality it is done with a great deal of finesse.<br /><br />Phew! I got so caught up in talking about why I love this movie that I almost forgot my reason for bumping it down from 5 to 4 stars.<br /><br />*SPOILERS & Complaints*<br /><br />1) If you YouTube the deleted scenes, and you know the story, you'll find that at least one important plot point has been omitted. In the finished product, Rochester never explains to Jane how he came to be Adele's guardian. There is no mention of his affair with the opera dancer, or any inclination that he was previously unfaithful to his wife. Well, judge for yourself on that one, but I think that was an important omission, and the deleted scene is so short that I don't think it warranted being cut out. The fact that Rochester has been unfaithful to his wife (insane though she may be) is part of his darker side, and one of the reasons Jane resolves to leave Thornfield. She doesn't want to be just another of Rochester's mistresses, and she's afraid that he will eventually discard her once he is no longer enamored with her.<br /><br />2) I wish that the &#34;horse-chestnut&#34; tree had been played up more. That is a very crucial symbol in the book and foreshadows much about their relationship; I think it could have had great screen-potential for dramatic effect.<br /><br />3) No gypsy? Oh well. I suppose most versions love to keep the Gothic element, but that scene is just so funny! [If you have no clue what I'm talking about, read the book]<br /><br />4) Rochester is still too pretty at the end. He's supposed to be blinded AND disfigured, in that he loses his left hand (or the use of it at the very least). Some would say, &#34;Really? That bothers you?&#34; Well, a little, yes. Rochester has learned his lesson and basically his penance is in the loss of his physical beauty to a certain extent... But Jane's love is strong enough to see through it. I think in leaving Rochester only scruffy and partially blinded diminishes the strength of Jane's love by comparison.<br /><br />Overall, no movie adaptation is perfect, but this one is as close as it gets! I would DEFINITELY recommend it!
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|Great read and got it on time... I'd work with them again in the future!! Good stuff. Liked the DVD.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This settlers you chose the level of difficulty that you want to play from small child level to expert.  The pictures are fun too.
B000EWD1KK|5.0|This if a wonderful movie.  It can be viewed by all ages without concern for language or violence.  It may be from the late forties, but it is put together well enough that it will be the classic for all ages.
B00CLZ48FA|1.0|I want my 4.99 back. Worst movie I've seen in a long time. Boring and terrible. Totaly disappointing. How did the actors feel after being part of such a week movie. What a disservice to the original Wizard of Oz.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I rented this movie to see Noah Lomax since he is the nephew of a friend of mine.  The movie is tolerable.  I love the setting since Southport, NC, is such a charming town, but I was disappointed that Noah's role was so small;  however, that's really no reflection on the movie.  Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel were very good.
B00D3V97DO|3.0|It's not bad, and for only $8 it was worth a shot. Overall, it sounds like a lot of old Sabbath made new again. A lot of the tunes seem like one offs of their big hits, same riffs, same chord progressions. It's not bad, I was just hoping for better...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just difficult enough to keep you interested. Not so difficult as to leave you frustrated. Very good for a free game.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I'm on my grammars kindle my name isn't Peggy I removed this Its BULL CRAP ITS A WASTE OF Space don't get this crapy game you just click....
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I loved this app it was the best free game that gameloft ever made its fun and I could play this game every day if I wanted to
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|If there ever was an OZ fan its me, but I just knew before I even \\"tried\\" to watch this I would be disappointed.  Ive always loved the original story by Baum, and the 1939 MGM production.  Never much cared for the versions produced before the '39 film, nor the Baum stories he wrote after the 1900 original.<br /><br />I guess its just something that cant be replicated-Dorothy, Toto, Scarecrow, Tinman, and Lion.  Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and the Tornado of course snaking its way towards the Gale farmhouse is imprinted in all our minds when we think of OZ.<br /><br />The OZ munchkins, Glenda the good, the Wicked witch of the West, and the Wizard himself all are part of our American dream.  The MGM production was a nightmare to produce, took three directors, several rewrites, injuries on set, and so much more money than anyone thought possible at the time.<br /><br />This new film was nice to look at, and I really did like James Franco, and Michelle Williams even though I thought they were forcing themselves to make this disaster of a film work.  It didnt.  All the other actors, including both witches were so miscast its pathetic.  They both seemed bored with their characters, and not at all believable.<br /><br />Its sad that so much work went into this new OZ, but it was all a wasted effort.  I doubt anyone will remember it in a few years.  After 75 years the MGM production is still being watched and loved by millions.
B00756GRUE|4.0|Hi, didn't see anywhere else to ask this question. I bought this for my nephew who is going to Underwater Welding School soon. Anyone actually use this Dive watch for Diving? I am concerned about the silver band in salt water everyday. thanks.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I think this book was as good as the other two and can't wait to read book 4 when it comes out
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|fun game.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who likes spooky games.This is a simple game but its not too simple, I like a slight challenge. And this game is fun for me.
0143038419|4.0|I fully expected to think this book was okay but not great, I mean how much in common could I have with a woman who had the luxury of taking of a year off and the ability to travel to three separate countries during that time? However her self-honesty is so completely compelling you can't help but empathize with her struggles. A very enjoyable read that encourages self examination.
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|Bad editing, writing, and selection of actors other than Bruce. Really painful given the fact that the original is the best action movie of all time. I mean, painful.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Loved it.  Quirky and fun.  Can't wait to catch up with the following seasons.  If you liked this show you will love Warehouse 13 too.
B00005UWQT|3.0|I sent it back it would not play in DVD player , only in a computer I hope to see my refund soon
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very entertaining and enjoyable. Easy to understand why so many have fallen in love with it. It is a good show to watch.
B009ZFPQOQ|1.0|The app Immediately crashes on splash screen.  Running CM 10.1 (jellybean) on a galaxy nexus... No Google services if that matters.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I am not a fan of the whimsical or super natural at all, and I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  It's well written.  It weaves a great tale.  It's a romance novel, which isn't my cup of tea, but still intelligent, which made it worth continuing to read.<br /><br />I subsequently bought the sequel to the trilogy, and really loved it, because of the historical facts/people/places that were intertwined in that tale and made it an interesting read.<br /><br />Witches, vamps and daemons?  Yeah, it's kind of out there, but this author makes it tolerable.
B00BHMEOP2|5.0|Great movie, actors, plot and very informative.  Details the ways government handles delicate international situations of terror.<br />Probably only a few people would have known about these heroic acts among Americans were it not for the rescue.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|This one was a little to far out there even for me.  It was not at all what I expected.  Waste of time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Quick read that left me hungering for more. Loved the ways the characters were portrayed and the strength they displayed in the face of certain death.
1451695195|5.0|This book is far and away the best book I have ever read.  I tell everyone I meet about it and encourage them to read it.  I tell them &#34;It will change your life.&#34;  I have bought several extra copies to give away.  People see the title and think it is about religion, but it isn't. It's a page turner that will change your life!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I loved the movie. now I can create my own reef and watch the freinds of Nemo and his dad Marlin enjoy what I have created. this is a great game for any age. I highly recommend this game.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Seriously?  It's an eBay app.  Not too much to say.  If you buy things on eBay and want to do so on your tablet or phone, this app will let you do it.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|this movie makes me laugh every time I watch it.<br />not only does it have its funny moments but is a very good movie overall.
B006M4F67A|1.0|I diden't even know that I have this game. sow if I do how do I play it on my computer
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Not the best picture quality. Would like to see more options, would recommend for random shots. Wish the Kindle had two way camera option like iPad.
B0094K1QR8|5.0|enjoyed the movie and loved the way it played on my kindle  Would recommend it to my friends to  watch
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was amazing! I loved it .the only thing is that it fatally short ....to me that is cause I run thought books like water<br /> So yeah I was short but it was good .keep making more Jeff
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I love the way it's written in a story-telling fashion.  I love the way the real word comparisons and application of breaking the cycle are introduced and reiterated time after time.  From Tony Dungee to Target, this book really gives you an insight to how changing one little part of the cycle breaks the habit almost immediately and forces the human brain to reroute the neurological pathways.<br /><br />Fantastic read.
B004V5QWU2|4.0|Seems like a cool application. Does all it says it will. Running on Kindle Fire original just fine. Recommended to purchase.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the BEST game ever!!!! I would recommend this for people who love horses or who wants a hose. I play this for game for hours
B000JMKQX0|5.0|When I started this book I was looking for an entirely different  story, but  what I read was better. From the opening paragraph to last sentence it was intelligent. I was made to feel that I was part of the book and I was in aftermath, which I wouldn't because I have bad knees and I would have one of the first to killed.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|Lots of action in this retelling of an old fairy tale.  Not enough back story to make this entertaining for me.  Especially since watching on the computer was not a good experience.  Dark murky scenes that made it hard to follow the action. Predictable plot and not much of it.  Characters not all that interesting.  A real dud of a film.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Great movie for the family, you will love the humer and characters. Watch it I dare you. Also, shows great examples of friendship
B0018OHFK0|5.0|One of my favorite popcorn flips. Enjoy 😃. I watched on ipad and flawless picture and found. Rent it or buy it mow
B00AEFY66U|5.0|Beautiful movie - the original has wonderful cinematography, true to the ERA! Most importantly-this film introduces the younger generation to Robert Redford ,the award-winning actor- who is the innovator and created for awareness of independent films  through pioneering  the Sundance Film Festival!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game is a fun time for children.even though it doesn't have everything its fun.I love this game.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|I liked it despite the fact I always dread watching musicals, not my thing.  However, not only did I make it through this one, I thoroughly enjoyed the performances.  They were all so good, it made me like a genre I don't normally like.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|Some great nuggets of wisdom and good insight into who Sheryl Sandburg is.  I have a lot of respect for Ms Sandburg but her approach is not for everyone.  It's not about getting that seat at the table amongst men - they will gladly allow competent women to climb the ladder.  It's the older women who want to hold the younger women back - the ones they see as a threat.  But that's another book for another day.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a great movie. I have seen it twice and will watch again. Jennifer Lawrence was superb! Don't miss this one.
B008476HBM|5.0|Got the book for free. It's brilliant. It is a very good and funny and educational story with a very happy ending. The kindle version is of high quality and I haven't found any mistakes.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This is the first external flash that I've purchased, but I am very pleased with it.  It is easy to use and produces much better photos than using the pop-up flash on my D90.  Being able to use the flash remotely is super helpful (and super easy).  Highly recommended.
B006OFN0SE|2.0|too dark - hard to hear I really would like a refund - what else do you want? I had to strain to see and understand tru the whole show
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I guess I am still an Adam Sandler fan, when I don't know it's him.  I recommend watching this or even adding it to your collection.
0143145088|5.0|Highly recommend the listen and read, I bought both the Drive audio and paperback books-- Love the depth and breadth of application, examples and research-based content.  Learned about this great resource from our daughter who recommended it a Rotary scholastic achievement banquet where she was speaking.  Daniel H. Pink shows cadillac performance and style in Drive!
B007NZQU72|4.0|While neither me or my son \\"qualify\\" as highly sensitive, we do have some of the traits. This book was very educational, and made me see some of the situations in his day to day life in a new way. Also made me rethink quite a few events from my own childhood.<br /><br />On the downside I wish the book had more references and that it was written in a more neutral style - I could be overreacting, but the way I read it, it almost feels like it is trying to convince me that I'm a sensitive person. Still a very interesting read!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I loved this book. The first few chapters were a bit boring, but after that I simply couldn't put it down. Well done!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|&#34;Despicable Me&#34; is a funny movie. We enjoy watching this movie. It make us laugh! The minions are the cutest!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I'll just give my impression and leave all of the political stuff to someone else.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book immensely. It was a littler shorter than I thought it would be, but the story was about a 25 minute mission and the lead up to it, not his entire Navy career. He did include a few great stories about operations that he participated in, but I felt these were to give context to show the people he operated with. One of my favorite stories was the &#34;Staff Of Power&#34; story, classic.<br /><br />A bit of introspection and humility were present, which was a nice touch. Overall a great, fast read. I hope he writes a second book detailing some of the other stuff he has done.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|I did like the movie and the special effects where decent.  I honestly don't feel it was a good part for J. Renner, but would watch again to see Gemma Artarton....Meow.  She saved the movie for me.  It is a good time killer, but own it only if you are in to these movies.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|Yeah this is alright.<br />I mean there is a small irrational part of your brain that thinks this new Sabbath record is going to be a good as \\"Masters of Reality\\" or \\"Vol. 4\\", full of classic tracks like \\"War Pigs\\", or \\"Sweet Leaf\\".<br />But what we are presented with is a good solid album, no small part because of Rick Rubin's production (this must have been on the very top of his hit list from the very start of his producing career).<br />Butler's & Iommi's playing are really made to shine with Rubin behind the control desk, & even Ozzy's singing is pretty strong (there have been rumours that he has been using the dreaded auto-tune on his last couple of records).<br />The fat could have been trimmed a bit on the album, Sabbath try to make every song an epic, but that's a small quibble.<br />So when this final history of Black Sabbath is written, I think this record will probably be a minor foot-note, but they certainly haven't shown themselves up, & for all of their fans who are too young to remember there hay-day it' a nice little blast from the past.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|its a really fun game and is tottally worth the money but it takes up a crap load of space and could use a longer story but is still totally worth the money I just wish you fouls replay old missions
B008I34YYY|5.0|This movie is great for a B movie! Special effects and acting are easily on par with any &#34;A&#34; list movie! With a larger advertising budget I think this would have made a splash on the Theaters.
1449415881|5.0|What can I say, my day just doesn't seem complete without my Dilbert fix.  I buy this year after year, and hope they never stop making them.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Update 5/16- I re-read this book and enjoyed the second reading as much as the first time.  This book is a great insight into what makes Anthony Bourdain tick. I almost felt like I was actually listening to him talk. This was a very smooth read- not many memoirs can say that.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|It is worth watching.  I don't know about owning, although kids may like this one a little more.  I did like the jokes.
B0089XH38M|5.0|Before starting, allow me to say that I am expert in computers and security.  Also, I have used the same email provider since the late 1990's, now called Earthlink, so email viruses are generally handled there, before reaching inboxes or Outlook.<br /><br />AVG is free, updates regularly to combat virus up-to-date, and only the browser module is too slow for practical use (then again, this is on 1.6GHz Pentium CPU PC's at home).  However, most importantly, it has been compatible with everything else.<br /><br />Panda Titanium came first and was not easily unseated.  Unfortunately, one version upgrade consumed far too much time and effort, so AVG was challenged to a duel.  One comparative scan revealed identical results, so FREE AVG won the showdown.<br /><br />After over a decade its maturity has earned credibility through rapid evolutions of applications (even alpha and beta versions), and agreement was unanimous among extremely cautious family and friends, to whom it was recommended along the way.<br /><br />Only Avast was an intermittent competitor, when the free version of AVG appeared to no longer exist or was too hard to find for download (minimum patience).  Norton was tested by others, who started rumors of compatibility with their applications, Windows versions, and patches over time - not living up to expectations.  IMHO, it is too expensive for a home environment.  The firewalled router and Adware (free) combination are preferred instead, so Norton was never considered for competition.  On your firewall, have someone else or DIY (if you know how), use anti-virus software (available free for most firewalls)l, activate WPA2 AES-256 wireless security on both your router and call connecting devices,  limit the number of DHCP IP addresses available to only the number of devices that you are connecting, and finally, only allow the MAC addresses of your devices to access your router.  All of this is non-simplistic, but worth the effort.  If you have only B or Glevel wireless router and/or cable or DSL of 1.5MB or slower, this might not be practical, as the overhead from WPA2 AES-256 security might slow it down too much.  If so, try lower security levels, even WAP or WEP 64 or 128-bit, as some security is better than none.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Found this book to be a fast read, interesting, and relatable.  I liked the authors set up and enjoyed how it all unfolded in the end even though it wasn't happy.  That's hard to do.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|I enjoy watching this show set in England showing the life and times of two villages (two classes of people) - one elite (rich) one working class (struggling).  It tells of stories of the ties between the two.

1781162646|5.0|This Hard Case crime novel is so readable the pages nearly turn themselves. I anticipated that Joyland would be the standard detective novel with a few Stephen King touches thrown in. While it truly is a crime novel, Joyland is all about Heart and Soul and the human condition, told without sappiness. Joyland istold in such a compelling fashion and reveals so much of the intentions,expectations and cosequences of the major characters as they deal withlove and loss and regret and fear of what the future might bring, that this wonderfully enjoyable read further establishes that even an author as prolific as Stephen King can indeed continue to mature in their ability to not only tell a good yarn, but also give the reader unexpected insights about what is really important as each of us slips through time, one existential second to the next. Yes,Joyland is really that good!<br /><br />Devin is a protagonist filled with the universal self doubts of one on the verge of adulthood and learning a new language to express these feelings,the language of carney talk. It is a crime novel and we do discover \\"who done it\\" but by the time we do, King has already provided us with so many insights about what it means tobe human, whether enthusiastc, struggling, naive or damaged, that by the time the evil is revealed, it feels more like one extra puzzle at the end of a compelling game that has already provided hours of fun and diversion of the grandest sort. I apologize for the awkwardness of this review,I am the worst at pecking out a letter at atime on my Kindle Fire HD. However,I was entertained and supplied with so many thoughtful insights by Joyland that I wanted to write the review ASAP after the last page was turned. I have no doubt that some will think I have read more into this crime novel than King intended. I must tell you tbat I have not always been a fan of Kings work and through the years have been disappointed and even felt ripped off a few times. All I know is that King has become increasingly better in recent efforts at giving us more than we were expecting and maybe practice does make perfect. I was not expecting to gain as much insight into considering the human condition from a Stephen King crime novel as I might gain from reading a major work,such as The Forsyte Saga--but I have and allI can say is \\"Bravo\\" Mr. King on an amazing accomplishment that is terribly entertaining while making me think and is achieved in such a way that one does not detract from the other. Now, if only Amazon would make submitting reviews a little more user friendly! THANKS FOR THE WONDERFUL RIDE AND THE HEARTFELT REMINDERS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A THINKING, FEELING HUMAN,MR. KING. While this review has been short of details fromthe book, I hope it adequately describes what a maserwork Joyland is and how the paybacks to reading it can be exponential,if the reader allows themselves to go beyond their expectations--to see beyond the shape of the stone,so that all the multifacited layers might be appreciated!
B002HFP0QU|5.0|This is a wonderful CD with all of the Bee Gees hits and a few songs I had never heard of. There is not one song on the CD that I do not like. I would recommend this to anyone that likes the Bee Gees and even those who don't.

B005IZLPMY|5.0|Great movie that is not afraid to be proudly American. This is nice, since so many movies tone that theme down due to international sales.<br /><br />Chris Evans does a good job as Rogers/Cap. The movie isn't super fast paced, since it is a set up for The Avengers.
0375869026|5.0|This is a book geared towards Middle School aged children however everyone who reads it will get some wonderful knowledge out of this text.  We can all relate to some level but also realize &#34;life could be worse&#34; I recommend it for everyone!!
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I like the addition of a second nom. Not as fun as the original though. The costume changes for the different ages are cool too.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|It's no kite runner characters are introduced and their stories are never completely followed up on, the reader never really gets to care too much about many of the characters
B008JFUPK8|1.0|Now growing up there's a popular lesson that i grew up with and that is \\"if it ain't broke don't fix it\\", there are so many things that are wrong with this movie but before that i'll start with the good thing's. In this re-imagining or remake they seem to have finally outdone them themselves by changing the look of the \\"S\\" which i liked so much better than the previous routh \\"S\\" of 2006 and they also added in a few alterations to the sides and waist of the cavill suite which gives it a little alien touch which was awesome. Although i'm not too bothered by the case of the missing iconic red pants giving director snyder reasons for not having them in this release so guess i'll let him have this one but that was it, that was the only good thing about this movie period.<br />Now for the bad things wrong with this movie when a new film struggles to be a blockbuster you should already know by now that there's a problem and the problem was that this movie completely screwed up and basically pulled a \\"smallville\\" by changing everything and messing up some major superman canon, it was NOT the dc universe or for that matter have any true superman mythology implicated in this garbage flick. There is a reason that certain things are put in place and when that's out of the window all is lost, and why all of a sudden do they have to darken the colors of superman's cloth to fit this \\"dark knight\\" image persona superman after all he is a force for good and is the reason why he's clothes are bright and what also happened to \\"truth and justice in the american way\\". All through out the time when cavill becomes superman let's not forget they also have him do a lot of collateral damage when in actuality superman refrains from doing such things knowing people could get hurt which i recall is part of superman's fighting technique \\"preserve life at all cost\\". Superman i'm afraid is no longer an american hero and instead is trying to be turned into this anti cult hero like spawn, guyver, batman or even deathstroke and has been botched by the masses and the idiotic entertainment industry - R.I.P Superman<br />In the end when it comes down to it, i wouldn't recommend this movie to any REAL superman fans especially those who have read the comics let alone those who know very little and would like to expand their knowledge on the character. To those who wanna learn more about superman i would recommend the first 2 \\"alexander & illya salkind\\" movies with christopher reeve or if you want to see a much more updated version of a superman movie then watch \\"superman returns\\" of 2006 it fared much better...even though that movie doesn't offer a whole lot it still is the latest movie that is canon to the superman mythology.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book until the end. I don't want to give anything away, so I won't go into details. The end just seemed rushed, like Crouch needed to finish the book. This won't stop me from buying the second book in this series, though. Since the premise has been set, maybe things will get better.<br /><br />If you like Outer Limits style stories, Blake Crouch is for you.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Love Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in this movie! Great chemistry and wonderful story line...definitely earned a 5 star rating!!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This is a very good game .  Love the graphic although the background could be a little-lighter.  Would recommend this game to anyone who like to search for objects.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book kept me hooked the whole time. It makes you want a relationship as passionate at Gideon and Eva's. The only part I was a little upset about was the ending because I wanted more. The author does say another book is coming so I guess I'll just have to wait to see what happens next. I would recommend these books to anyone who enjoyed fifty shades of grey. I think it's even better than fifty shades.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|We gave this movie five stars.  It was so much better than Identity Thief which we gave 1 star (and could not even finish).<br /><br />I really don't like the fact that I have to type 20 words to review a movie.

1591845556|2.0|Assuming this book was already in the works last November, then there must have been a serious \\"Oh s@!t!\\" moment for the author when Tim Ferriss' book, \\"The 4 Hour Chef\\" was released and he realized, \\"We're saying the same thing. Mine's just not as good!\\" If this book wasn't already underway, then someone should call foul-play because the similarities are conspicuous: An approach to rapid skill acquisition that involves deconstructing something into its most basic components and a focus on the highest value activities, an emphasis on language-acquisition, a Tiger Woods comparison and a semi-rebuttal to Malcolm Gladwell and the \\"10,000 Rule.\\" That's just the beginning.<br /><br />(Josh goes beyond Tim here and includes the tasteless subtitle, \\"Damn You, Malcolm Gladwell\\", calling out a man who has written three of the most influential books of the 21st century. Ballsy, to start. Besides that, the bone with Gladwell seems misguided as he was evaluating what accounted for the humongous gap of success between the likes of The Beatles [\\"Bigger than Jesus\\"] or Bill Gates [one of the wealthiest men...ever!], and their contemporaries. The theory was about lopsided success at the most extreme levels not general skill acquisition. Finally, it's just poor form. Don't bite the hand that feeds you. Gladwell's conclusions were way more influential and compelling than anything you're going to find here).<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />My disappointment with this book isn't so much that this approach wouldn't, or doesn't, work, it's that the book is incredibly underwhelming, skimpy at best, and none of the author's results or conclusions are all that striking, rapid, or convincing.<br /><br />The introduction can be summed up like this: Pick a skill you're interested in, break it down, buy some books or watch some hi-res Youtube videos on the topic, practice for about 20 hours, and you can become... mediocre. The next six chapters attempt to demonstrate this through some of Josh's own projects.<br /><br />Some examples of skimpiness and advice on what's to come:<br />- Two checklists that sum up the entire process.<br />- Explanations of the learning curve. Thank you. God, I've been wondering about this. Glad to have it finally broken down for me! (Oh yeah, Tim's book had this too).<br />- 6 pages of stick figures doing yoga poses.<br />- A chapter on computer programming, with pages of irrelevant code that you should skip entirely, unless you're really lost and in need of direction such as, \\"I already have a computer, which is a start: You can't program without one\\" (pg 89). Now that you've got that covered...<br />- A chapter on touch typing that you should also skip entirely.<br />- A chapter on the board game Go, which I'd never heard of, and that was moderately interesting, but again, pages and pages of diagrams, skimming, and more gems like, \\"Mind = Blown. This game is huge.\\"<br />- Ukelele and windsurfing.<br /><br />Aside from the annoying, self-congratulatory tone throughout (\\"I'm effectively a business professor, but I don't work for a university\\" [pg 70]), probably the saddest part of this book is that the author's conclusions about acquiring new skills don't actually match what his experiences testing these theories are telling us. At the end of 20 hours of yoga practice, he concludes that it has some benefits, he likes it, and he'll keep doing it at home. After 20 hours of practicing Go (or writing and programming), he concludes, \\"I have mixed feelings about Go... my leisure time is limited, and Go seems to require the same sort of intense, focused concentration that writing and programming demand. While Go can be fun, at the end of a long day, Go feels a bit too much like work.\\" In other words, he's getting his ass kicked by people online, and realizing it takes more than 20 hours to get to the point where it doesn't feel like work, i.e. The steep part of the learning curve. He'll come back to this one later, when he has more time to devote to it. He's learned to play some basic songs on the ukulele and has completed a live performance (Kudos. Seriously, Kudos), and will continue to sing and play for/with his daughter, which is sweet, but we've also heard quite a lot about her by this point... As for wind-surfing, not so much: \\"I tally up my total practice hours, and come up short of my goal: nine hours of practice total, far less than the twenty I wanted to spend by this point. I spent more time than that on the water paddleboarding.\\" But at least we get a nice promise: \\"By the time you read this, it will once again be windsurfing season... I'll reacquire the basic level of skill quickly.\\" Meaning, like, the ability to stand up on the board.<br /><br />So, self-admittedly, he didn't really learn each of these skills. He just dabbled in them and scratched some curiosity itches. Three of six would be generous. One of them he's giving up on completely because progressing any further will take more time, and another he only did for 9 hours. Yet despite all of this, he feels justified in saying, \\"In less than a year, I learned six complex skills.\\" He finishes with the sage advice that, \\"If you want to acquire a new skills, you have to practice. There is no other way.\\" Gold.<br /><br />So, what to make of \\"The First 20 Hours\\"?<br /><br />Well, if you're the type who equates trying windsurfing a few times with actually possessing the skill of windsurfing, or considers it remarkable and rapid progress to have gotten better at a complex board game by having read a few books and played the game online 33 times, or if you're just the type that likes to have stories on-hand of all the cool feats you're accomplishing so that you can tell people all about them at your next party (when you really only know OF them, or have tried them for maybe a few hours), then you'll probably like this book. (Note: Even if you're good, don't mention the online gaming. Just don't).<br /><br />Personally, this isn't the type of \\"learning\\" or \\"skill acquisition\\" that I'm particularly interested in. This is poseurism. This is gathering stones (not conquering territory) exemplified, and if \\"The Personal MBA\\" is the result of 10,000 hours, then this book is what you get from the first 20.
0857685570|5.0|Beautiful execution of Struzan's work, which was my main focus. Also a lot of work not normally seen, which was interesting and personal notes from Struzan which gave the work and his career a new dimension for me.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|I too had a self absorbed and very selfish mother. I, however did not have the opportunity to be educated in Europe, and live in Japan. In many ways she did Sachi a favor by making her stand on her own. I always thought Shirley MacLaine was talented, kinda kooky, but benign and lovable.  I see now that she is cold and selfish and self absorbed.

B00AF6MF9I|4.0|great decent game I like it and it s fun but I wouldn't say that is is the best game ever
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|A sizzling read that will leave you hanging and pissed off.  Unlike many reviewers, I felt that there was a story - G & E become more settled and questions left from previous books are finally answered, ie, Who abused G?,  What happened to this person?, Why did Dr. Lucas lie?, Are G & E going to get married?  I enjoyed the book and was glad to read that both E & G feel more secure in their relationship.  Sex was sizzling, as always.<br /><br />However, like many readers, I was EXTREMELY annoyed that the third novel did not end the story.  I don't care what happens to Corrine (G needs to boot her out of his life) or Cary either.  The most interesting story line, in my opinion, is the development of the relationship between Eva's parents.  However, to leave readers hanging as Ms. Day did, without even telling us when the next two (apparently there are going to be five in the series) books are going to appear, or if they have even been WRITTEN, was unfair.  Like many other readers, I couldn't wait for this book to come out.  Then, to find out I have to read two more books to get to an ending REALLY pissed me off.<br /><br />I'd like to know if E ends up working for G, if E's parents finally get together, what happens at her boss' wedding and several other things, but not enough to buy the next two books.  I don't enjoy being jerked around, and this is EXACTLY what Ms. Day has done.  I hope other readers refuse to buy the next two books in order to send Ms. Day a message:  We made the first two (maybe three) books best sellers;  we can make the last two bomb.  Furthermore, we are unlikely to buy any more more of your \\"series\\" books because we do not trust you to not jerk us around again.<br /><br />I like this \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" knockoff better than the original Fifty Shades trilogy (at least I did), because the characters were easier to relate to.  However, I will NOT be held hostage.  I can live without knowing how G & E's story ends (if it ever does - I can envision Ms. Day writing about G & E's children in a never ending \\"Crossfine\\" saga).  No thanks, Ms. Day.

I literally skipped entire chapters almost. Finish it up please make the last few books great like the first... I don't want to wait 4 years for another mediocre book.

B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I love Tom Hanks. I like most of the other people in this film. Having said that, I don't know WHAT happened in this movie. Not a joke, not an insult, I watched the whole thing - start to finish - and at the end felt like I had been lobotomized. I got the gist of it, that love transcends even death. Great. This painfully long movie did a terrible job of explaining that... and the makeup and accents were terrible. That didn't help anything either. In trying to make them look like different versions of themselves, the poor makeup (not helped with High Definition) just made them caricatures of themselves. I was bored a half hour into the movie, and thought that maybe it would get better. It didn't. It doesn't.
B007KQI1NA|2.0|The 3 inch CD disk they provide will not work in Mac slot drive. I have a 13\\" Macbook Pro running OS X Mountain Lion.  In frustration with all the other approaches, I put the small CD supplied in the slot drive on my Mac and spent most of a morning taking the computer apart to get it out. The downloadable software they offer online as a substitute is difficult to install because it has not been identified/certified by Apple. The 'Gatekeeper' prevents installation. Many suggested work arounds found by Googling did not work. The info.exe file you need is available on the unusable CD and the one they suggest you download online is for Windows. I gave up trying to use my Mac and put it on my Windows laptop. Everything worked better except for the last step; connecting to the satellites. I will call their support number when they are open and let you know how it goes.<br /><br />You can open the downloaded version on the Mac. Go to the launchpad, select System Preferences, Select Security and Privacy, select the General tab, supply your password, unlock it, click on 'Anywhere' in the \\"Allow applications downloaded from:\\" list. Be sure to go back and change this setting when you are done! You still will not have access to the info.exe file which seems to be necessary.<br /><br />I would have given this product one star but I am hopeful Support can solve my problems.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|the movie was just ok, but it would have been better if we had the clarity we get from netflix streaming. would like to understand why, even with HD that it was so poor... pls refund me. Thank you. Tom davis
B006S53QCK|4.0|Yes, the film is strange, but worth seeing for the alluring Kim Basinger.  She does an erotic strip-tease dance in it that is absolutely fabulous.  There is also a young and handsome Mickey Rourke, with a performance worth a look.  Didn't love the film, but did like it.  But, I did LOVE Basinger and Rourke!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Didn't like the adaptation from the book.  Director didn't capture the character of Jack Reacher.  Tom Cruise was better than I thought though.  I didn't like the way the ending was changed and condensed. I guess that why we have books, more time to develop the character and the plot.
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|I like the dialogue.  also, the two character's personas were well contrasted.  i wonder if the book is better. maybe

I am embarrassed to say that my 6-yo child figured out the laws of physics on this game faster than I did with the accelerator and brake functions while airborne....
B0071XO8RA|2.0|No real sciFi just the time. More of a slow moving murder mystery. Very hard to get attached to any character.<br />  Mostly life in an ant hill. I think it is a fast read,  but I kept putting it down.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved this book I really couldn't put it down. A dramatic end to a great series. Well done, Suzanne!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Easy game to pick up and waste some time. Don`t expect to get very far very fast without spending real money, but still very playable.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|The app is easy to use, both for Android and PC. My only gripe -- and it's less about the app than the songs that can't be saved to the cloud -- is that when I purchase a CD on Amazon, only some of the songs transfer to the cloud. In some cases, very few of the songs. I'm guessing this is a copyright issue, but it is disappointing nonetheless. If not for that, I'd give the app 5 stars.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Hyperlinks do not work when viewing PDFs<br />Spelling app to be purchased separately.<br />Same with additional fonts.<br />Still a long way to justify having to pay when compared to other freely available options
B009KWU6Q2|4.0|Enjoyed the movie very much.  Great to watch as a family.  The children will truly enjoy this sequel to Peter Pan.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect. I'd seen previews and was interested. Once I began watching the film, I was caught. I didn't want to miss a minute of it. It was deep and entertaining. I have recommended it to my friends. It must be watched from the beginning. One cannot come in on it at a later point and understand the full concept of the film. So glad I purchased it. Good movie!
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|Great, good plot but not as good as SG1. Last season kind of lame. Id still watch it again though.
1781162646|5.0|I read Joyland in two days and now consider it one of Mr. Kings best work. After reading e-books for the last couple years I was troubled that I was not able to read this on my kindle and would have to actually purchase the book. What was Mr. King thinking?? However, once I cradled this new book in my hands, I was swept up and lost myself into yet another amazing story which I could not put down. An e-book cannot do that for you in my opinion.
B005HJU7HA|3.0|Got bogged down reading the whole thing.  Better to just read one or two episodes and come back to itlater.
B005OZE9SA|3.0|Before you read any further, you need to know one thing: The 2i2 \\"latency free\\" function depends on a Stienberg propriety driver system called ASIO.<br /><br />The first multi-tracker I had was the classic Tascam Porta Studio 2. I bought it on Eflea back when I was a teenager. When I gave the thirty year old machine to a buddy, it was still working.<br /><br />The next multi-tracker I owned was a Fostex digital 6-track. That worked for about four years then bricked itself, leading to my purchase of the 2i2.<br /><br />The build quality of the machine is not quite the quality I was expecting after reading online reviews. It has a very \\"Walmartt Effect\\" plasticy feel. Sure, it is wrapped in aluminium, but everything is cheap feeling plastic. The monitor and headphone knobs in particular are cheap plastic. I'm assuming the pots underneath match the quality. The inputs are also plastic. When did inputs even start being made of plastic? So this is not something that is going to last thirty years. I'm guessing two to three years. The plastic inputs, considering the amount of friction inputs receive, can't be expected to last that long.<br /><br />The sound quality, once you get the device to work, is excellent. A huge jump up from my previous Fostex digital. You will not need something better than this for home recordings.<br /><br />Now, here is something you need to know if you are looking at this budget device. I'm assuming if you are looking at this device you are not wealthy. The 2i2 \\"latency free\\" function depends on a Stienberg propriety driver system called ASIO. So the 2i2 will not work with Audacity or any other open source software unless you compile your own version with ASIO support. If you are running Linux, you'll need to run Wine and hope for the best, unless you are a genius. This is not a minor detail if you are on a budget.<br /><br />My advice would be to forget about the 2i2 if you do not have a copy of Windows or Mac OSX.<br /><br />So I started working with Windows 7 because I had a copy (shudder).<br /><br />The DAW that comes with the 2i2, Ableton Live Lite 8, is nothing like working with a tape machine. It is the least intuitive piece of software I have ever worked with. From what I managed to tell, it seems to be designed mostly for \\"Girl Talk\\" style DJs. Plus, the \\"Lite\\" version is severely crippled. You get something like 4-tracks total. That's right, you are back to 4-tracking. You can upgrade to the full version for the low, low price of 599$. Suddenly your 150$ budget device starts to feel a whole lot less budget.<br /><br />I wonder how much money Focusrite gets from the makers of Ableton everytime they sell one of these? Unless they are the same company. I smell a loss leader.<br /><br />Cakewalk makes a piece of crap DAW that works with 2i2 and ASIO, called music maker or something, but does not allow you to import plugins. So it's pretty worthless. And actual Cakewalk is a few hundred dollars.<br /><br />This was the dark wood I found myself in with this device.<br /><br />I thought about The Pirate Hay, but I didn't want to go piracy.<br /><br />I was on the verge of returning the thing and going back to cassettes when I discovered a piece of software called \\"Reaper\\" being discussed in the backwaters of an online audio recording forum. \\"Reaper\\" sells for 60$ and is compatible with this device. In fact, it works great.<br /><br />So at the end of the day, add 60$ to the purchase price of this thing unless you already have an ASIO DAW, are cool with stealing software, or are a programming genius.
1608871452|5.0|You have to get this. Great gift for any fan of the show. I need seven more words. Really? Really!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Catches the moment and place in time. Well acted, directed and paced. This story while compelling for those involved,<br />might have been a difficult one to get viewers involved. Ben Affleck succeeded in engaging his audience. Maybe not<br />Best Picture level compared to other years, but it's very nice to see something story driven without the need to rely on CG,<br />huge budgets and Johnny Depp to pull them along.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Whether or not it reflects real history - it is entertaining - CAUtIon for adults only. Can't wait for September for the next season.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|So there are a lot of joke reviews on here right now, but here's some real talk: I just got back from seeing Equestria Girls and it really is excellent. The MLP cast and crew have created a movie that has every bit as much heart, magic, and quality as the series. The humor is still intelligent, the animation is still gorgeous, the characters are still themselves, and the writing is just as snappy and spirited as you'd expect from Meghan McCarthy. Don't judge Equestria Girls without giving it a chance, you'll be missing out on a gem of a film and a worthy addition to this generation of My Little Pony.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I loved the intrigue and the heroism of the characters.  And the fact that it was based on a true story.
B00457X7IQ|4.0|It's a good novel with new enemies and also a good ending that takes the reader into a great world hidden into plain sight.
1439153663|5.0|I enjoyed this book which was book of the month for my book club.<br />Others in my club liked it, too.  It gave us a history lesson about<br />plantation life in the 1800's as to race and families.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Awesome all around and this episode was great too!!!  Can't get enough of this series.  So good.  Wish I had discovered it since the pilot now I need to catch up.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Who can go wrong with an album of the Rolling Stones . Young at heart, the songs are timeless, not to mention great
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I am an avid fan of Hosseini's books.  &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; will always remain one of my all-time favorite books.  I enjoyed &#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34; but after finishing it I felt that there was something lacking.  Maybe I expected too much from the book because I was looking so forward to another one of Hosseini's works.........but after reflecting over the book, I cannot give it more than three stars.  It is a good book, beautifully written and there are some wonderful characters but you do not get the same interaction with the main characters as in the previous novels.  You never really get to know the main characters and you feel cheated by not really having the intimate details of their experiences and feelings.  It was not possible for me to get so deeply attached to Pari because her story got a bit disjointed and there were just too many side shows going on.  I loved the first 200 pages but after that, the whole book fell apart for me.  It was like looking at the beginning of a exquisite pattern, only to see small faults appear.  At the end, the 'pattern' did not work and you feel like there could and should have been MORE. I wanted to read more about Pari and Abdullah........I did not care a bit about some of the other characters and their stories felt flat and unnecessary.  The warmth and sharing of his characters from &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;Thousand Suns&#34; were absent.  It could have been a great book, it had all the potential but he diluted it with too many uninspiring side shows and unlikable characters.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I liked it because of just love Denzel.  I expected more though. . . not just a story about alcoholism. We all know the consequences of that.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is by far one of my favorites. I'm glad I downloaded it on kindle. It's definitely very addicting. Great game for the entire family.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I really enjoy using this app...It's hard to close it to move on to other interests.  I highly recommend it to others.
B004I654WQ|5.0|My son at 19 months loves this movie.  He gets so excited when he sees it.  Also there is a little bit of humor aimed towards older audiences so it makes it bearable to watch.  Fast delivery as always.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Sad...i was expecting it to get more difficult with multiple levels. I completed it in two hours I won't pay for another one. This seemed more like a preview instead of full game.
B007FROH4G|5.0|I enjoyed this book because my mother suffer from Vascular Dementia and I could relate with a lot of the main character's emotions.  Although early onset Alzheimer is different in some instances from Dementia it is still a form of Dementia.  I now understand a lot more about what my mom is going through and what she has been through over the last five years. So many of these 'silent' symptoms that slips through unnoticed is now so obvious to me and I wish I read this book earlier.  Lisa Genova know the subject matter really good but never lose sight of the story she is telling her audience.  You get to experience the main character frustrations of slowly losing her memory.  One of the many 'losses' a person with dementia suffers, is the loss of vocabulary.  This is told with compassion and insight as is the whole process.  In the end you come to the conclusion that although there is nothing to be done about the disease you can and must love the person involved.  Love is the answer.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Why is it that as soon as a series sells to tv, the author abandons the series? I'm thinking Ian Rankin: once the Inspector Rebus sold to BBC, that was it. Same thing here. Yes, the True Blood HBO series is far from the books, and I like the book plot lines better!, it just seems as if Harris was ready to move on. I definitely get that sense in this book. She doesn't care as much about the characters anymore. I can understand that; she's been with them a long time. It's just disappointing. I'll miss these characters, as they are in the books. The tv series is a poor substitute.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I find it much easier to have an electronic dictionary instead of having to look up words in a big heavy book, it is very convenient!!! On the other hand it doesn't make much of a difference because a dictionary is a dictionary electronic or not.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Halcyon is a well balanced and catchy album.  The infectious &#34;Lights&#34;, &#34;Anything Could Happen&#34;, and her collaboration with Calvin Harris &#34;I Need Your Love&#34; are reason enough to buy the album, but Ellie doesn't stop there.  Explosions, Dead in the water, and Say my name are equally catchy and moving ballads.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's so cool like the sun<br />And send it to your friend<br />And show it to your family<br />And show your team
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's free so give it a shot. It's a park builder with a smooth interface and a great if not slightly contrived story. Sometimes it lags but it doesn't't last long.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Was different from the games that I normally play, but better than I was expecting.give it a try,you won't be disappointed.
B004J4WNL2|2.0|Theories here absolutely ring true. I, too, shared these same definitions of introvert and extrovert with my adult students, and the fifty-fifty stat also holds true. The only problem here is that the book is about twice as long as it needs to be. Too many anecdotes that run on for too long.
B009X01C64|5.0|It works fine and it totally suits my need.  This is a good product, and expect it to last a long time. Thanks.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|From the chilling and moving sounds of &#34;Seven Devils&#34; to the more pop sounds of &#34;Shake it Out&#34; Florence + The Machine has done it again. A Great Album all around...
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I would recommend reading this book if you are going to see the movie.  I liked the idea of a &#34;clock&#34; .... clever.  Fast read.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|In my opinion the author went on longer than was necessary to tell the story.  I enjoyed most of the book even though my views were opposite of the author's. It seemed to me that the author very hastily ended the book.  The end was very depressing as opposed to how it started out.  It held so much promise but did not deliver.
1401937268|4.0|We purchased this item for Our Families Friends who have interests in Angels and also in Cards, and they seemed pleased with this item, but other than that, having no personal experiences to share for this particular deck, this is all we can say at this time. Thank you, Amazon. Blessings.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|Overall this is a really good album. He definitely has a unique sound, but that's what I like. Worth the $$ is you like the songs that have already been released as singles.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It is an honor and privilege to meet these people embodied with humanity that ties us all together with shared emotions.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Taylor Swift has done it again... With her signature Pop/Country sound, &#34;Red&#34; has something for everyone.  &#34;We are Never Ever...&#34;, &#34;Knew You Were Trouble&#34;, and &#34;22&#34; are the catchy pop radio tunes that you can't help but enjoy (although you may hate to admit it).  If the upbeat tracks don't readily get your fancy... the more solemn and moving ballads of &#34;All too Well&#34;, &#34;The Last Time&#34; and &#34;Everything has Change&#34; surely will.  The last two are each duets, one with Snow Patrol's lead singer and the other with Ed Shearen... The contrast between Taylor's voice and gent's is striking and rhythmically beautiful.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Soooo...I read this series to give each book a decent review.  I can't remember what happened in book 3 vs. 4 vs. 5! This is obviously the last book.  Mac continues to search for the Sinsar Dubh and also trying to figure out what she is...first she is this, then that, then this again.  That is all I can say...in fact I am pretty sure that saying anything about any part of this series is a spoiler!  Usually you can give a pretty good synopsis on things and give some opinions without giving away secrets, but not very easy with this series. That should at least tell you I thought they were good enough to read the entire series in less than two weeks and I am feeling slightly bereft because I am missing my friends now!
B004LWZWGK|2.0|After seeing Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, I had high hopes for Dark Knight Rises.  Now that I've seen the film, I have to admit that I'm quite disappointed.  The film underwhelms in so many areas, that I don't know where to begin.  First off, I've always thought that Christian Bale was a poor choice for the role of Batman.  He's not a bad actor, but this was just not the role for him.  The first two films in the trilogy were good IN SPITE of Bale due to great plots and excellent villains.  This film has neither.  The plot was so far-fetched and convoluted that it was totally unbelievable (even for a superhero movie).  The main villain, Bane, was portrayed more like a common terrorist than a super villain (ironically, I've seen scarier terrorists in other movies).  After the great portrayals of the Scarecrow, Ras Al Ghul, and especially the Joker from the other films, Bane just does not measure-up.<br /><br />My hectic schedule didn't allow me to see this movie when it was in theaters and, frankly, I'm glad I didn't.  This movie is a one-night rental at best.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excellent series overall and this season lives up to it's reputation.  So well done.  The actors and the plot continue to evolve and just keep you guessing and so entertained.  Loved it!!
B0069JBKHI|5.0|Very good product for hi-tech parents :) Recommended for everyone who want to check on baby any time. Love it.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|I've read all the books in this series a few times over the years. Once I get started my wife knows I will be heads down for a few months!
B001PJRAUS|3.0|I was definitely looking forward to this one when I found out it existed but was in the end disappointed.  In brief, it's a passable movie that I couldn't truly enjoy simply because of the heroine.  I understand she's supposed to represent the disillusioned modern British woman but that unfortunately also made her bland.  She doesn't hold a candle to Liz Bennet and I feel sorry for Darcy that he loses her in this one.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love this game. The ads after every hand is out of control.<br />I understand having ads , however one every 5 hands would be more like it.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Subtle and intelligent. Kevin Spacey does a great job, as usual. We couldn't stop watching one episode after the other... it's addictive
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is really challenging but really entertaining.... it has suspense and good quality... I like it so so  so so so so much
B0052AC8C6|5.0|this was so cute, it was more adult oriented then kids. I laughed from the beginning til the end.. Rango is so cute and halarius!!  I loved it.. :)
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Beth Hart's voice and JoBo's guitar make a great combination.  This is even better than their earlier collaboration.  I sure hope to see them together in concert!
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I showed this to my sixth grade class as a reward at the end of school and they really enjoyed it!
B000SEGQNS|5.0|This book helps to remind us about the user, how they use the web, what we want them to find on our site, and to make it all work together. It was personally recommended to me and I will now personally recommend it to other designers. It contains some good lessons in design that extend into all manners of design.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|What an amazing story.  Pi is so clear in his way of showing you what he feels and sees .  His words are images.  What an incredible tale of survival and loss
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I have always loved Mahjong, this is a great app, different puzzles nd I like the tile set selection....an  for .99 I'm impressed<br /><br />Danielle
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Fun characters, good mix of HO and mini games, decent story line.  Graphics are good, but on several screens only the hidden objects were visible...th rest of the screen was black.  ???
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|There is a reason that most reviewers are giving this CD a five star rating!  Because it is a five star CD!  In my opinion this is Faltskog's best solo offering to date. How fortunate for us that she decided to return to the recording studio once again.  Props have to be given to co-producer Jorgen Elofsson for writing or co-writing each of the 10 tracks.  These songs are pure pop confection at its best.  The hook can easily be found in any of these tracks.  It is hard to pick stand out tracks because they all have merit, but \\"I Should Have Followed You Home\\" is one. I love the way this starts out slowly, and then builds into a wonderfully driven dance track!  \\"Dance Your Pain Away\\" is a great dance track that will bring you right back to the days of ABBA. Also, \\"Back on Your Radio\\" is a great song, and to me, is also reminiscent of the ABBA days.  All in all, a great CD.  Too bad America has never really promoted Agnetha Faltskog as a solo artist, nor played much of her music. If you love this CD, be sure to get her \\"That's Me - The Greatest Hits\\" CD.  This is a collection of 19 of her best cuts, including 3 ABBA tracks.  Ahhhh, welcome back, Agnetha!
1402766785|5.0|This book full of information. Lots of pages and lots of fun. Highly recommended for anyone serious about art and drawing the human body!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved Season 1, so purchased Seasons 2 & 3. Bates and Anna's story line and all of the hired help's situations actually proved more interesting than the Lords and Ladies, mostly because they are more like all of us than the aristocrats' lives. Can't imagine having a position that actually dressed adults. Great story.
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|This is an amazing series keeps you on edge wanting to watch more.. This is an action packed show with many twists n turns
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I would have never thought that anyone could do justice to the original Star Trek series......but they did and they did it very well....this movie is awesome and I can't wait to see the next one.

With up-beat music and fun, quirky sound effects, you will not get easily bored.<br /><br />Slip, slide, and bounce your way to fun as the cute pudding monsters. Slide your finger to move the pudding without letting it slide away. Combine all the pudding in a level to create huge monsters in all different shall shapes and sizes. All ages will have fun on this challenging, intuitive game!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this game is so cool. It makes me feel like I have my own real live horse. I hope that a bunch of other people like this game to.

B00D5O7BPU|4.0|This app is a lot of fun, it is a good time waster, and I would recommend to anyone, just don't use it on the plane....I learned that the hard way, but anyway, it a amazing use it!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so great because when I don't have internet I can still play this game,when I'm bored and around my friends I play this game it's just so easy to play with I just love this app and when they make a new level they up grade mine it's just so cool
B00111YM5G|3.0|I don't like the guy with the white eyes.  Other than that the movie is the kind of genre I enjoy very, very much.

B00BC24NT4|5.0|Le Carre's recent book graphically describes the corporate nature of modern wars, which are fought by large corporations with their own ideologies for profit. While not his best writing, the theme of the book is nonetheless powerful. In this new world of war, the conscience of the individual, and indeed, the individual, is wholly expendable to the needs of the corporate-national alliance, and national security means protection of the corporate warrior.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I really love this game. My kindle fire is acting weird right now so I can't play it, but I miss this game and can't wait to get back to it. I love creative mode. I'm in the midst of making my own village so I love the new addition of chairs and tables. Does that sound weird? I wish I could put more people in my village, but you can't have everything! I hold a very friendly grudge against the spiders. In story mode they could follow you from a long distance and then kill you in two to three strikes, so I enjoy revenging myself in creative mode. once I made a pit full off monsters! Thanks for being made of awesome, Mind Blocks. Gosh,  I hope I can post this... my kindle's been acting so mean lately.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game.It really makes you think about where to go to find your next clue. There are also red herrings thrown in to confuse you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my first freebie game on my new kindle fire and it works very well allowing me to put blacks on reds and reds on blacks but never ever out of numerical order. Whoever coded this app knew exactly how to play the game! Ads? Sure but I can take 'em because I'm fully capable of saying to myself...I don't need that stuff!! Bring the ads on...no is my middle name!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is a beautiful movie,especially for high def. An incedible story and a pleasure to watch again.........I would highly recommend it.....
0425263924|3.0|I was soooo looking forward to the 3rd installment of the series as I really enjoyed the first two.  I felt like Sylvia Day never read the firs two books!! Entwined with You seemed to drag on without any resolution to anything!
B00280LYIM|5.0|The book was a great read  for a fourth grader. My son is in the forth grade and has complete the whole series.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|I liked the book because the author has a breezy, easy-to-read writing style and unorthodox viewpoints.  I didn't rate it higher because in places it reads like a collection of blog entries.  And I found some parts unpersuasive, such as the chapter \\"Honesty Makes You More Money\\".  I wish it were so, but I am not seeing it.  I still prefer honesty because I can relax more fully unconcerned with getting caught.  The chapter \\"Ten Ideas to Start You Off\\" is a bit goofy.  But one good idea would be worth many times the price of the book.
B000I5X81A|5.0|I'm a big fan of Clapton. I don't know how I missed this one. I kept hearing &#34;Ride the River&#34; on the radio, recognized Clapton, liked it but didn't know where the music came from. I found it! I had heard other cuts from J.J. Cale but was not really familiar with his work. (Ok, so I missed out, I'm catching up now.) I keep playing this album! My wife dances through the house as it plays. It catches you real fast.<br /><br />A warm Saturday morning, a good cup of coffee, Clapton on the stereo.....not much better!
1591845556|4.0|I gave the book four stars. I like John Locke's observation that the star system merely communicates whether the reviewer is the target audience. A five-star is somebody who is in the target audience (or a paid reviewer). A four-star is somebody \\"near\\" the target audience. Three or less the reviewer is not the target audience (or a troll). When reading reviews, I like to read the fives to see what the target thinks, and find out if I'm in that target. then I read other reviews to find the boundaries of said audience. I consider myself just outside the target audience...but the book I anticipate my kids may read in the next few years.<br /><br />I consider myself a journeyman skill acquirer. I'm a jack-of-all-trades, pushing the boundaries of my ignorance is my hobby. I've been at it since the 70s. This book's target appears to be the novice to apprentice level; somebody about a decade younger than me...who wasn't alive in the 70s.<br /><br />Fast read? I read it during a one-day conference while taking notes on the lecture. Either that speaks to how clearly he writes or there's not a lot of content. I'd seen his YouTube video so some of the material was familiar, but there's enough in the book to be distinctive.<br /><br />What I like about Josh is that he comes across as a man who genuinely wants to help his fellow layman overcome the fear and trepidation of learning. In pMBA, he shows the rift between learning and credentialing. It inspired me to do a personal reading in theology which was difficult at times. He's good at motivating and this book encouraged me to put together a Someday list of skills and start ticking them off.<br /><br />20 Hours is an extension of that meme. Skill acquisition, learning, education...they are distinct. His book does a sufficient job...you may not need to read further than his first few chapters to understand the structure of skill acquisition. If you've been at it for a while, then it might seem a little elementary.  What this book did was essentially confirm what I have learned by trial-and-error over these many decades. I still picked up a tip or two.<br /><br />The six anecdotal chapters are themselves interesting. I have no desire to learn or practice Yoga; and I've always wanted to pick up Go. He gives enough information on each to either satisfy your interest or goad it. Now I understand why I lost that one game of go I played in 1991. The point of his chapters was to show what it looked like to pick up a skill. If you were to write a list of six things you always wanted to learn to do that have a short cycle to basic competence, then he shows that you can pick up those skills in a year. I'm tempted to complain that the chapters were a bit longer. I think it would have helped if he had better mapped the relationship between his theory chapters to his practice chapters. I read two and skimmed another...he does at least show the relationship adequately.<br /><br />One thing his last chapter made me think about was skill capacitance. What happens when you start learning perishable skills (e.g. guitar playing) and step away from it? George Harrison could walk away from the guitar for five years and resume with little difficulty. But he has the 10K hours. After only 20-odd hours, those skills that perish need maintenance. What happens when you have enough of those skills that you can't maintain them all?k did was essentially confirm what I have learned by trial-and-error over these many decades. I still picked up a tip or two.<br /><br />The six anecdotal chapters are themselves interesting. I have no desire to learn or practice Yoga; and I've always wanted to pick up Go. He gives enough information on each to either satisfy your interest or goad it. Now I understand why I lost that one game of go I played in 1991. The point of his chapters was to show what it looked like to pick up a skill. If you were to write a list of six things you always wanted to learn to do that have a short cycle to basic competence, then he shows that you can pick up those skills in a year. I'm tempted to complain that the chapters were a bit longer. I think it would have helped if he had better mapped the relationship between his theory chapters to his practice chapters. I read two and skimmed another...he does at least show the relationship adequately.<br /><br />One thing his last chapter made me think about was skill capacitance. What happens when you start learning perishable skills (e.g. guitar playing) and step away from it? George Harrison could walk away from the guitar for five years and resume with little difficulty. But he has the 10K hours. After only 20-odd hours, those skills that perish need maintenance. What happens when you have enough of those skills that you can't maintain them all?
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Received as advertised it works as you advertised it it is a very handy app it was easy to install
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Keeping changes for the betterment for women in the forefront!  We are only half the of the population!  Never forget and keep working.
B004VQRCF0|4.0|While a great experience for YES fans, the recording is of a show in CA, NOT the killer show of the SAME tour in DENVER done &#34;in the 'round&#34;. Nothing but &#34;hits&#34; and if you are a REAL YES fan, well worth buying!
B00B97SNJI|4.0|They were unknown to me until I saw them on Jimmy Kimmel. They performed \\"From A Window Seat\\", second cut on the albuim. I was hooked within 10 seconds and had to find out more. Ordered it within a couple days from Amazon and was not disapointed. Play the clip, (not really long enough), if it's not your cup of tea look elsewhere.<br /><br />I mentioned clarity. You can hear each of the instruments! You can hear the voices. Not a lot of overdubbing. The sound is clear and uncomplicated.<br /><br />They, (Dawes), are performing in Boston June 21st but I have to be elsewhere. Wanted to go. Maybe next time.
0425241505|5.0|Wow, loved, loved, loved it.  Laugh out loud funny and achingly sweet.  Can't wait to read the next episode, that'll be tonight.  Sneaked a peak at the preview and I'm sure - well, sure hoping - Tricks' story will be just as good.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Though this story was very unrealistic and a bit hard to follow at times I really did enjoy it.  I would think anyone who liked \\"The Hunger Games\\" would enjoy this story too.  I think it would make a great movie!
B0010SEMP0|5.0|It's a very good book never was into these types of boom but after reading this i must read whole series
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Sometimes I need a &#34;chick flick&#34; fix, and this one fit the bill perfectly. It was a sweetly crafted love story with a bit of suspense. I cared about the characters - Josh Duhamel is definitely eye-candy but he is also a good actor - never over-acting, or wooden in his delivery. He is entirely believable as the good guy - easy-going and credible. Julianne Hough surprised me with her own acting skills. It wasn't an oscar caliber movie, but usually, those that are, bore me to tears. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the surprise at the end, which I won't ruin for anyone who hasn't seen it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Myth only complaint is that the game did not last long enough. This was a nice change from some of the mindless games I enjoy playing, and I can't wait to download the next one.
1400069807|4.0|Will let you know just exactly how much poison you put in your body - very helpful in telling you what you need to know to stay healthy..
B007HUD6OS|5.0|From \\"The Firm\\" through \\"Theodore Boone, The Activist\\" John Grisham remains a great writer.  The more he writes the better it gets.  I love the Theo Boone series, though I think the reviewer who wants to make them required reading is off base.  Requiring them would take something from them. \\"The Activist\\" (#4 in the series) is the best yet.  Keep writing, Mr. Grisham.
B0014J8D9Q|4.0|Great movie directed by Clint Eastwood. Morgan Freeman was also awesome in this movie. The cast was just wonderful, wonerful
0439023491|5.0|I'm ony a little emarrassed at how much I loved the entire series. I know that the series tend to appeal to teen girls
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It fulfilled all my expectations I was hoping for in this book.  The suspense, love between the character,and friendship with Cary.  Wonderful job cannot wait for next book to see where you take  Eva and Gideon.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book even more than the hunger games. This book is amazing and I wish there was a sequel. You go ender!
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|It's a great game and all but I didn't get enough experience to buy the next suit and it won't let me play until I buy that suit. So basically what I'm saying is that the game won't let me play the game and its really making me angry.
B004LWZW88|5.0|This is such a cute movie! We scored a great deal on this movie as well! Go pop some popcorn and have a nice family movie night :)
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Very good app; computer's &#34;competence level&#34; is quite high and you feel that you play against a decent oponent.<br />Would recomend to any chess fan.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|So goooooood!!!!! only a few shows have left Mr as enamored as Fringe: 1) Lost, 2) Felicity, 3) X-Files and 4) Six Feet Under. Watch it.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Did not realize was from book but enjoyed selection and played nonstop for the state of Oklahoma while traveling. Many familiar compositions made it more enjoyable since the music was recognizable. A good bargain, arrived quickly.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I think this book would do good to those who want to improve in the areas that they have issues in.I have no problem communicating  with anyone.I think me being shy & reading this will help me  fix the mistakes i have with women & approaching them.It takes awhile before we  overcome the negative things in life.
B00005JMYI|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I left the theatre thinking it was absolutely stupid. However, for the next week, I couldn't stop quoting the movie every five seconds. Milk might be a bad choice, but Anchorman is the best choice.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|this book is about real life and real dads and how to improve your relationship with your whole family. great!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is awesome! Great way to find ideas for crafts, gardening, recipes, and just about anything you are interested in! I especially love the inspiration for knitting and crochet projects! Pinterest is my new addiction!
0307951529|1.0|I don't normally write bad reviews however I am perplexed at how this book has so many good ones when really it is just<br />made of fluff and has no real information on how to start a business and certainly not on a $100.<br /><br />This is not a book about how the \\"common man\\" can start a business, nor is it written by someone who knows what its like to start a business<br />from the kitchen table (if your lucky enough to have one) or  bedroom apartment like I did.<br /><br />It seems the last few years we have a bunch of fake lifestyle entrepreneurs that sell the dream but don't delivery the goods. The author, Chris Guillebeau went to university<br />then spent 4 years doing charity work and now emerges as some business expert.<br /><br />Now some of you reading this may know I have a New York Times best-selling book The Millionaire Dropout [[ASIN:B00CPOQAGM The Millionaire Dropout: Fire Your Boss. Do What You Love. Reclaim Your Life!]] but don't think for a minute I am trying to sell you my book,if you want to read my book go to the library and get it for free. Trust me I did not write a $12.99 book to get rich, I already am a mult-millionaire and I made my money from businesses and investing not books.<br /><br />All I want to do is warn you that if you want to start your own business learn from people that have really done it.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|A fun puzzle game to pass the time. It accomplishes the goal of keeping you entertained in short or long bursts.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This is a very effective and efficient tool. Does even more than I expected. Recommend it to all who are utilizing the benefits of their IPhone.
0062238868|5.0|very informative. you feel as if you are a part of war not just a spectator. i think chris might have a little pit bull in him.
B005T87QCI|2.0|This would be a great free title but i when i actually buy a game, i expect it to be fun every time i play it. All the bots have the same combos just different graffics for each one. So when u learn the combos for one bot, you know them for all. This makes the game very repetitive . Plus you have to spend more  money for other bots.... which in the end is the exact same as the other bots just in different clothing. I got bored with the game after 20 mins dont waste ur money. That being said the game play is smooth and the graffics are not badly done. 2 stars and a big K.O. after the first round :/
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Came in two days from Amazon, works like a charm. I can never have enough as I tend to misplace them from time to time.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft Punk has gone back to their roots with this CD. It is very funky. True Daft Punk lovers will appreciate this new CD.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I started watching this with series 5 but now I have gone back to start all over from series 1.  Very entertaining and what I like is that they don't use all the language that some other shows use.  Violent yes.
B000MD9UJC|1.0|this &#34;upgrade&#34; did nothing for my mag light. it upgraded my irritation. Go to Lowes and buy it so you at least can return it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I like this kind of sci-fi murder mystery show.  Its cool to be able to start from the first season and watch all the way through
B00005N6KG|5.0|I use them to run and work out. They are very lightweight, fit well, and they don't get annoying when you get sweaty, unlike ear buds. 5/5
B004UFEJVW|5.0|I love this movie and decided I needed to have it on Blu-ray. This is one of the best Pixar movies ever made.
B0091REZMW|5.0|just bought this App and so far it is wonderful. my son even enjoys playing it. it was definitely a great purchase.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Why am I just now watching this when it ran on CBS a few years ago?  Awesome actors , intriguing plots, and each show ends with a twist....highly recommended and you won't be able to watch just one episode !
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Enjoyed the movie, it was worth the money and I would recommend it to others. Tom Cruise does well in this role.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|OK -- I'm never ever again reading reviews about my favorite authors before I start a book. I'm going to go on my instinct that there is a very good reason that I enjoy reading the author. When I got Entwined and read some of reviews I had a really hard time getting started. I finally just dived in this weekend. I'm really glade I did! This book was yet again another great book by Sylvia Day, for me that is. I do agree that everyone is entitled to their opinion and have the right to share them. (As I am now :)).<br /><br />It seems that when anyone reads a book that we are always wanting more from our favorite characters, especially someone like Gideon. I know that $8 is a lot to pay for a book and maybe she is trying to make more money. However I believe that an author should get paid for all the time they put into a book and having a Publishing Company involved means that they are going to charge more. I will say that I hope they do not take as long getting the next book out. HINT HINT!!!!<br /><br />I loved the humor that flowed through Gideon and Eva in this book...<br /><br />\\"Waking up to you is like...... presents on Christmas morning.\\" His mouth curved. \\"For your convenience, I'm already unwrapped. Batteries not required.\\"<br /><br />Gideon is still as smooth as silk with his words when talking to Eva about how he fills about her. The kinda words that make you want to hand the book to your husband and say \\"Here, read this and memorize it\\".<br /><br />\\"When your eyes turn soft and dreamy, I'll be the one who put that look on you, not a toy.\\"<br />\\"Day One of my life was the day I met you.\\"<br />\\"The only way for a woman to get my attention is to be you.\\"<br /><br />This book was different from the other two books. I felt like their relationship had taken a new direction. You could really tell that they had grown into each other and had learned a lot about themselves.<br /><br />I am looking forward to book #4, however I do hope Mrs. Day can get it out sooner:)!
B001DM1VXE|3.0|I gave it a three because the quality was fair and the movie was just okay. Not like the real Pi
B003QTSMXE|1.0|This movie is largely environmentalist brainwashing for kids.  Like a lot of children's movies today, it is more Hollywood brainwashing than entertainment.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting, almost compelling to read the next chapter. Not because I really liked it, but because I was wrapped up in the disturbing who was right, who was guilty question.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's really fun when you are bored and want a little bit of a challenge. I am trying for all the awards.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|A little slow to start, but I can hardly wait for number three to come out!  It's a definite winner
