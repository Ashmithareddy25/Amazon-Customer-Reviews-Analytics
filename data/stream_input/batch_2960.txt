B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I really like the game but I only play it when I'm home.  Sometimes I just open the app to do the scratches and don't play so that I'll have enough tokens to play more than one game later.  Kind of annoying that you have to watch videos AND pay for tokens if you want to play much but the actual game is fun.
B00821OX98|5.0|Awesome! Each season gets better and better. Not cheesy and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Great show
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|This is a pretty straight puzzle adventure, without too much plot, but enough to give you a feeling of urgency about figuring it out. The puzzles range from obvious to sneaky; none are impossibly difficult and none are really stupidly easy. There is a hint guide in the game, which I found useful for reminding me what I had already done after taking a break. I think some could play this game in a sitting, but I stretched it out over a couple of weeks. I'm fond of Nicola Tesla, so it was neat to have an adventure game about him.
B008GFI3QE|5.0|this dvd is a must have in any serious collecton of the Beatles best material i  have seen  on the man behind the console
0545123291|3.0|If you read my review of Shiver, you will know that I wasn't really a big fan. So why did I read Linger? Well, I guess I was curious about what was going to happen to Sam and Grace. I had also heard that Linger was much better than Shiver. So I picked it up and gave it a go. While Linger is definitely not one of the best books I have ever read, it was much better than Shiver.<br /><br />I'll begin with what bothered me. I hate when a happily ever after is ruined and that is exactly what happened here. Shiver left the reader feeling content and satisfied, only to rip it all away in Linger. Everything you thought you knew changes and things that were answered are once again questions. Also, I have never read a book with so many depressed characters. Between Sam being mopey, Cole with his suicidal tendencies, Isabel feeling guilty, and Grace hating her situation; I was getting a bit annoyed. I mean did every character have to be depressed, couldn't one of them lighten the mood and be normal.  On another note, I absolutely loathed Grace's parents. Oh and thats another thing, why are all the parents in this book crazy, oblivious, and simply not at all parental? I understand if one of them has Mommy and Daddy problems, but all of them? To me it seems a very convenient way to explain away all of these teens running around and doing what they please. One set of attentive and truly caring parents would have been nice.<br /><br />Okay now what I liked. I truly enjoyed the introduction of Cole. In my opinion he is the best character in the books, even with his moroseness. He is witty and sarcastic and always has an answer. He is incredibly smart and talented, but he is also troubled and flawed and looking for a way out.<br /><br />Once again I enjoyed reading from numerous perspectives and enjoyed the introduction of Isabel's and Cole's perspectives. It was a nice way to keep the story moving and switch things up. This is one of the reasons this book did not drag like the last one. Switching perspectives kept the pace moving.<br /><br />I will admit that Linger surprised me. I thought I had the answer and knew what was happening, only to be surprised. While I did guess part of the ending, there was a lot that surprised me as well. Clearly the characters have somehow worked their way under my skin, because without even realizing it, the book made me cry. I was not expecting to feel that strongly about these characters.<br /><br />All in all Linger is an okay read. Like I said its not my favorite, but I did not hate it either. If you liked Shiver then you will love Linger and if you thought Shiver was ehh, well Linger gets much better. I am still not a huge fan of werewolves, but this isn't your normal werewolf book and these aren't your typical werewolves. I know this review kinda contradicts itself at points, but honestly I don't have any clear thoughts on the book either way. If I used a rating system, this book would fall smack in the middle.one.

B005BY3XHC|5.0|This wonderful little book helps pick me up whenever I forget to be present. It's been a great reminder to allow myself to be happy, and that I don't have to work so hard for it. Quite the opposite, I'm usually working overtime to keep myself unhappy.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Great app. My 7 month grandson was simply awe struck when this dog started talking to him and saying his name. Thank you Amazon, I love all you do to make your customers happy.
0545128285|5.0|An awesome addition to the movies/books. It gives you another piece of the wizarding world. It goes great with my Harry Potter collection, and it's a great read.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Fabulous story full of heart. What I didn't like was when it was over. Wanted to hang with Dan and Abra a little longer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its very amusing<br /><br />but don't update it I was on the last game and I updated it and lost all my data
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is kind of like Mist you need to find out what you are required to find and receive more rooms to check out.  I enjoy playing and think you will to.
B0012NVGHU|4.0|We had pretty bad reception but overall we liked the movie.  Amazingly, Amazon knew about the problem and is crediting our account.  Wondering about watching it again...
B00CH26TL8|5.0|good, great, and all the accolades that I could give it are to be given the people that make the game.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|This app is incredible. I found out about it through Vsauce3's Youtube series, &quot;App All Knight&quot;, and was delighted to find it on the Amazon Appstore. I downloaded it immediately, and I was impressed. The tutorials don't feel rushed and they're not explained through pictures only ( we're looking at you, Bad Piggies). It feels like a real person is guiding you through the instructions, and even better the game feels real. When launching your rocket, you have to account for atmospheric drag and the pull of gravity. You can launch your rocket into orbit, try your luck at a moon landing (or a Smoon landing as the game calls it) or even attach wheels to your rocket and make a rover-type thingy. All in all, SimpleRockets won't dissapoint.
B00190N4E4|3.0|Gandhi was human, and had his weaknesses.  But you wouldn't know it from this movie, this is about Gandhi the soon-to-revered, and presents him as someone just barely short of being a god.  I would have preferred him presented as a great man, with all his compassion and leadership and steadfastness, but also with some human weaknesses.<br /><br />Further, although I don't want to go into the history in a brief review (there are many authoritative sources for those who might be interested), but the portrayal of events, and of the other important players, is a bit too slick and shallow.  It does great disservice to a worldwide audience that is unlikely to hear another version of the story.
B0015DROBO|2.0|This book is a quick read, but I was left with nothing when the story was done.  Read it, or leave it.
B004LWZW42|5.0|I love the entire series of the X Men. Five star all the way. Wolverine will always be my favorite mutant.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Really not what was expected.  I will re-think before buying another. Between you and me he has not met our expectations.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|My 1real issue with this game is that either I'm terrible or the Times needed to beat these tracks are way to tight.<br /><br />Graphics are good.<br />Races a bit repetitive.<br />Steering is a bit sensitive, but use a tap on the break helps correct. They don't tell you that in the game though.<br />My only real issue is you have to be nearly spot on to advance. What about us who just are not great racers? No easy mode or hard mode in this game.
B00EP0KBXM|1.0|This movie is really bad right from the beginning.  Horrible dialog....bad writing...and Will Smith left his acting hat at home.  The only movie I have ever seen worse than this was the Last Airbender (also an M Night film).
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This game is amazing if I were you i would buy it the only thing is they need to release the second one so please if your reading this get the game
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Great read. Couldn't it it down for a minute. Some parts I did not expect. Especially the ending. Would recommend to others.
0143121421|5.0|I just reread it and it totally holds up over time. John Le Carre' is an amazing writer. So highly recommended cold war spy novel.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Completely engrossing, shocking, thought-provoking and real.  There are always secrets and what-ifs and egos...this book will make you think long and hard about your actions and motivations throughout your life.  I recognized myself in snippets of thoughts and feelings the characters had. Very well and insightfully written.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|How nice to read a book that I didn't want to end. It doesn't happen very often anymore. The pace is good and the story is suspenseful and fresh.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Fun game, it's challenging and fun like I said. Looking to find a download for papa pear saga for my kindle fire hd, does anyone know where I can download from?
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Simple easy to learn.  Much more fluid than stock. Made me a much better And faster typer.  Has a great spell check.  Overall I won't use another keyboard now.
B000PAAH3K|3.0|Interesting analysis of the sub-conscience, the way we process information, and our abilities--and sometimes lack thereof--to make accurate judgments in all areas of life.
B007JMW46U|4.0|A simple, straight-forward read. Doesn't take too much time to get through, and quite entertaining. Would recommend, especially since it's free :)
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Had a great time reading this book! It was just great reading all of the books together. Now I am looking forward to the next book.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|Beautiful prose to catch the reader. Multi layered and poignant. My first Colum McCann read, but it won't be my last.
B00F2362IE|4.0|I really like it but it took to long to donload. You shuold load this app but it will take very long to load
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Guys,<br /><br />Buy this. It's so good.<br /><br />I saw DT in Philly when they toured for this album. Amazing. Maybe I'm a bit younger, but wasn't too into the earlier stuff. LOVED Liquid Tension Experiment, and as my personal tastes got heavier, this was the logical next step. Octavarium was decent...but Train of Thought is still hands down my favorite DT album.<br /><br />I can still sing every guitar solo like an idiot. Highly recommended. Get it now.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|loving the minions. app doesnt freeze. restarts right away. game is just awesome. different levels of fun and excitement overall.
1595141979|5.0|Yesterday I bought the second and third book in the series.  Tonight, I have nothing to read. The series is just that good.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Lots of fun to play. I take it with me when I am waiting at the doctors office. It makes the time go by.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I hadn't read this book since middle school, so when I saw it for free on the Kindle, I thought I'd pick it up. A great story and would highly recommend!
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Didn't have great expectations in this movie as a &#34;hair raising&#34; experience but, boy, was I wrong!  This movie really promotes the idea of zombies being a real possible outcome from a pandemic outbreak.  Unlike &#34;I am Legend&#34; and &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; where they really skip over the science of &#34;zombieism&#34; (is that a word?) this movie attempts to put science and modern day society squarely behind the whole 'undead' concept.  It does gloss over the decay factor but because it moves so quickly you don't think about it until you get into the Extras on the DVD. The cast plays it straight up which makes it that more believable.  You still have to suspend your analytical side for the story in some places but overall, definitely viewable many times over.
B00B9366VO|5.0|I never realized how many albums were produced in that place... crazy. A must watch for anyone who loves music.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Sooo Much better than the earlier version with Stallone, I enjoyed this movie it's a simple action movie with intense Violence and some gore, The acting is pretty good also for this movie genre, but above everything else it's a fun movie to watch if your into intense violence, if your someone that cringes when someone is shot, you might not want to see this movie, It will make you uncomfortable, But as I said if your into this kind of a movie, it is very enjoyable, has a dry sense of humor in parts and teaches us that things look pretty dark in the future.
B000063147|4.0|Man, I loved this band back in the day. It's so sad, the direction they've gone. Anyways. Love it. Intro to We Come Out at Night alone is worth it.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I use this for making simple spreadsheets.  It is very feature rich like the full version of MS Excel but I still have not figured out how to select multiple cells for merging and cut and paste.  It would be nice to have a instructions on how to do this.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|This is a great app that allows you to set up multiple alarms, check the weather for the hour, day,or week all in the same
B00BGI086Q|5.0|This is a great show and it so much fun to watch.  The stories suck you in and you don't want it to end!  I particulary love the island flashbacks of \\"becoming the Arrow\\" and they are interwoven so well into the current day story that I feel like I'm getting two stories in one.  The action is fantastic.  The acting is fantastic.  It's is just very well done.  I can't wait to see more!
0316010669|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell is one of my favorite authors, if nothing but for how well he gets you thinking about things you never realized. Blink dissects the notion of first impressions and the effects that they have on you. Wonderful read and very well written.
B00EP0KBXM|3.0|Nothing spectacular, I think Will Smith Sat back on this one and let his kid do all the good parts in the movie.  Many scenes your watching Jaden and you think it's Will.  Ok but not great!
B000077VR3|4.0|A beautiful story between a prostitue and a man. It teaches about love and how it can triumph over evil.<br /><br />*spoiler* Satine's death was so sad though, but at least she died happy.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I guess, with all the PR about it, I expected more.  It was just an okay film.  Affleck is probably a great director or writer but his acting is rather stiff, I find.  And since he's playing the main character, that left me feeling disappointed in the film.  Affleck is just not very believable in any role I have seen him in, including this film.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|The incomparable legend that is Cher, is like a phoenix that constantly rises to surprise us with something bigger and better each time she embarks on a new project. Closer To The Truth shows that her voice gets better with time. She is living proof that no matter what happens in her life and career, she rises above it all to be larger than life, yet still remain down to earth and accessible as a person and an artist. It is no wonder that so many identify with her, because she is the epitome of survival and living life to the fullest, with no regrets and never looking back. The album is aptly titled because we all are continuously  moving forward in our journey to move closer to the truth and to a better understanding of ourselves. Only Cher can enjoy such a long and illustrious career and still remain provocative, relevant and at the same time keep us all wondering what she will do next. Her voice is beautiful on this new musical effort and she proves again that love and life spring eternal!
B0053KWDES|4.0|This is AMAZING! Combined with the right pair of headphones, it makes a stunning difference. The only issue is that I find myself needing to charge this quite often.
B0007TKNII|4.0|A very lovely story. It's intense and sad, but lovely. A very enjoyable film. I do prefer the musical more than the movie, but it's good nontheless.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Maybe because I am female I just couldn't really get into this film as much as I can some others.  It just didn't strike me as anything more than just an &#34;okay&#34; film.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|After watching the television version of King and Maxwell, I had to read the books.  This one did not disappoint.  The dynamic between K & M is excellent.  I'll keep reading!
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Great game. Just wish it had more of a story line within the game. It's worth it anyway. Hoping they second game is just as good.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|The first Vonnegut book I read as a teenager. Just as good 35 years later. And will be great the next time.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Yes, I get that it's a comedy and the profanity is the particular &#34;schtick&#34; for this film but I found it used too often and too randomly.  Just not my kind of movie.  For these reasons I can't recommend it.
B00CIVLZ3U|4.0|Steelheart imagines a universe where an event known as Calamity has taken place, ten years before the events of the novel human beings start gaining powers known as 'Epics' taking their cue from comics they adopt alter egos Nightwelder, FireFight, DeathPoint etc however unlike the comics without exception 'Epics' are murderous arrogant, and bent on Domination classic Supervillains.<br /><br />In the ruins of Chicago, now know known as newcago, a young man known as David seeks revenge for the death of his father ten years before at the hands of the most powerful 'Epic' of all Steelheart. He wishes to join the reckoners the elusive last remnants of a human resistantce, paranoid secretive and distrustful they are reluctant to take him as a member, but David has a secret he is the only person to have ever seen Steelheart bleed.<br /><br />Action packed, full of imaginative ideas, and filled with the kind of tight coherent story telling that the genre needs more of, Steelheart plumbs the depts of Comic Book lore and Cliches while never becoming a parody. While i do have quibbles they are relatively minor but since they stood out enough to annoy me and i want to give a balanced review here they are:<br />* Its been only ten years from Calamity yet modern swearwords are gone? Made up swearwords are fine but something better then 'Sparks' may be called for.<br />* I dont need every character to be dark and tortured, or a morally ambigous out for themselves mercenary, but as bad ass and violent as they describe themselves, just killers is used repeatedly to sum up there mission, they are suprisingly clean cut and idealistic fine if it was one or two but not all of them, makes it hard for characters other then David to stand out.<br />* The Romance is heavy handed, and clumsy and there is no sense of chemistry indeed in a story with no problem with violence its strangely platonic in all senses.<br />As i said the above is merely minor quibbles Steelheart is an exciting startin a new series one i hope to follow for years to come.
B009CG9CXO|5.0|This classic of the genre is a must-see. The animatronic shark still holds up well against today's special effects. Spielberg is a master -- THE master -- at using action sequences to augment, fill out, and support the story, rather than as a poor substitute for a story.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!! A CLASSIC already, its not as up beat as Thank Me Later, which is something that a lot of Drake fans might expect but it's still a GREAT album. Its a much more mellow side of Drake that you can just listen and chill to or ride to I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!! If you haven't heard it yet please do, you WILL NOT be disappointed. 5 stars and 2 thumbs up for Drake!!!
B005PK553C|4.0|This is an entertaining show, keeps your eyes wide open waiting for what will happen next. Just as any good horror story, the twists surprised me which is rare. Highly recommend, did have some nightmares, but still recommend.

0307476073|3.0|As challenging to write about a hike over 15 years ago, as making the hike itself.  But when you are the Queen of the PCT, I would expect no less.  I hiked part of it in 1978 and remember to this day what it felt like to wash my hair for the first time in weeks.  The author though seems to have forgotten her first shower on the trail.  I have been backpacking in the wilderness of the West for more than 35 years, but never had frozen water bottles in my tent when the temp was in the 20's.  But as Queen, when everyone bows down to you, such things must be possible.  She starts out as an idiot, in her own words, and worn out too, but all's well that ends well, becoming stronger than the men in the military, smarter than the hunters, and rid of her unwanted pregnancy.  Amazing.  But the dreams of brutally killing her Mom and smashing her Mom in the mouth are less than amazing.  More like sad, quite so.  Sad too is her drug use, no fault divorce, and illicit sex, when she comes on to the a guy.  When the tables are turned and the guy comes on to her, she becomes a classic hypocrite, planning on driving an arrow through his throat.  Not so mysterious in light of the fact she has no moral foundation.  No wonder, our Country is in the shape it's in and slouching ever faster toward Gomorrah.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|This film is just so adorable I've watched it four times I believe. If I am ever feeling a bit frumpy this makes me laugh, cry, and laugh some more. So adorbs, highly recommend!
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|My daughter who is a junior high student was reading this book with her class and suggested that I read it. I love to read and I was curious about the book that had my daughter's attention. The movie Jonas's world was introduced I wanted to know more. This is a great story to make you awaken your senses. I love the ending!
B008CIUS72|4.0|Flash isn't on a lot of Android phones and tablets by default, as well as iPads/iPhones (Steve Jobs famously hated and banned Flash from those devices).  It *is* possible to manually \\"side-load\\" Flash onto a lot of devices.  This app is for playing .swf Shockwave files (games, animation files, etc) once you have Flash loaded onto your device.<br /><br />SWF files are different from normal Flash .flv files in that FLV files are moving picture files (with a set order of frames playing sequentially) whereas SWF files are animation files (that can be changed or interrupted by user intervention).<br /><br />This app is quite elegant and simple, with no popup ads and big, easy controls.  There's a couple of tweeks I've emailed to the developer to see if there can be a 'pro' version of this app with the ability to hide a couple of icons and/or let this app run without logging you into your Amazon account before running (in my application, I want to turn off wifi and deregister the Kindle so that children using the Kindle can't accidentally purchase things on my Amazon account).<br /><br />There are other, more flexible, more thorough SWF players out there, but for meat-and-potatoes playback, this does just fine.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|my daughter recommended this to me and boy does it open your eyes is a simple to read and understand manor, I have finally found out why my mother and i do not really get along very well.  sadly i now know it will prob. never change but it has give me the tools to try and change this outcome. but if it doesn't at least now i know why.  it was also fun to realize each of my children's individual love languages, it will help me to better convey my love for them if done in their own unique way. It makes understanding people in general so much easier. I highly highly recommend this book to any couple not getting along. you will be amazed at how simple life can be with each other. and I also recommend this book to everyone else because it will help you throughout your lifetime with the people you meet and already know.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I enjoyed this film. I haven't read the book so that may be the reason for why I enjoyed it. Nonetheless, this movie has put the book on my reading list. I found the movie to be a love story, one of everlasting love. A love that last for centuries. You know what I'm going to give it another watch! Bottom line if you love romantic, adventure, and sci-fy this may be a great watch. Highly recommend!
0807014273|5.0|I was recommended this book and at first I thought I would not like it but it is good.  Go ahead and give it a try.
1401937519|1.0|The best work I have read on immortality is one that tears down the arguments in certain schools of philosophy and science against immortal life, and proceeds to argue why consciousness cannot be material, but must be immaterial. The book is by Robert Geis, \\"In My Ever After: Immortality and Its Critics.\\" I was surprised that Kenneth Ring in his comments here in the reviewers' section did not mention Dr. Geis' work. The book by Ms. Moorjani I am sure is well-intentioned and sincere. But that good intention does not get one to more solid foundation for an awareness that immortal existence as a person is a likelihood. Geis' book does just that. Another book is by Michael Marsh. \\"A Matter of Personal Survival.\\" Anecdotal stories usually do not hold up in a court of law. Moorjani's would not. Works stemming from hard thought and good evidence usually are what convince a jury of readers. I suggest Geis and Marsh will do just that for those who read their books.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The first time I heard of Stephen King and The Shining was on a dark, cold night in the winter of my 11th year, 1978. My parents had invited a young man who worked over at \\"The Club\\", a small resort area where we had a weekend home. I was still sad and disappointed that I had missed seeing Carol Burnett who had been staying two houses down from us while filming the Fall portion of the movie, The Four Seasons just a couple of months earlier. She was my idol and I still could not get passed my once in a lifetime chance to meet her. On that night, after dinner, or dinner guest began to tell us the story of The Shining, start to finish and in amazing detail. He spoke until nearly 1 am. I was amazed and horrified, not only with the images he spoke of from the book but the reality was that my mother and I were essentially living with Jack Torrence.<br /><br />For that night, and it is the only one like that I can remember, my mother, father and I all sat and listened to the most captivating story I had ever heard. Perhaps my father saw it through Jack's eyes and was frightened, only briefly of himself. My mother had to recognize Wendy and her fears as those of her own.  After hearing the story and the general scary stuff in it, I stopped being scared about my parents for a time. I was to busy checking the bushes for sudden movements. I got the book as soon as I could and was even more astounded when I read the story for myself. Not only was the book even more terrifying in reading each detail, I believe that in reading it I actually started to examine and name the chaos in our home. Even so, I got lost in that book and read it cover to cover twice. When the movie came out, I think the emotions of fear overwhelmed me...not the maze or the other inhabitants of the overlook but the fear of Jack was to much. My grandmother took me to see it and was none to happy when I told her I need to leave.<br /><br />The book has remained one of my favorites ever since. Sorry but they can keep the movie. Give me hedge monsters and faulty boilers anytime. After The Shining, I got every King novel as soon as I could. I have read most but, admittedly, not all. Doctor Sleep brought back for me that excitement of reading my first Stephen King books and revisiting Danny T may have lingering effects I'm not even sure of yet. I loved it. Finished it in 4 nights. Thank you SK.

0385528787|5.0|MaddAddam is a wonderful conclusion to Margaret Atwood's post-apocalyptic trilogy that begins with Oryx and Crake and continues with The Year of the Flood.  I read both of those other novels right when they came out, but I almost wish I had waited until this one was published to read them all in succession.  (I love Atwood, so there is no way I would have done that!)  It is the probably not too distant future, after contemporary society has collapsed, a few survivors are living together, trying to get by.  There are a handful of humans, as well as some \\"Crakers,\\" a genetically engineered group of human-like creatures.  Atwood has woven a great story together with an incisive criticism of contemporary society.  Her criticism is not heavy-handed or obvious, however, and that makes MaddAddam such a wonderful read.  This novel is thought-provoking and witty.  Very well-done.  Enjoy!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|if you only have a desktop computer, don't bother buying this product. We could not get it to connect until we used my son's laptop, then were able to use either. To set it up, you definitely need a laptop,etc.  While the technical people at the company are nice, even they couldn't figure out how to do it with just a desktop, even though we've been members of Netflix for quite awhile.
B00BGI086Q|5.0|i love Arrow it is my favorite show. the first 12 episodes are a little slow but the show improves after that. Arrow is great interpretation of Green arrow. some of the characters can be a little annoying but i recommend you get this! Arrow is a great show with great quality, great stunts and great special effects! the special features on this dvd are great, as-well!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I did not expect to enjoy this\\"book\\" as much as I did. The writing made this worth reading.  I WILL be reading more of Hugh Howey's work.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Always a pleasure to read a Forsyth novel. This is not his best, but still is a good read. Hard to put down.
0307277674|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat.  I couldn't put it down.  I would highly recommend this book to others.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Would have been 5 stars if there was more than 10 levels. Very addictive. Did the whole thing in one night. Couldn't put it down.
B009NET0H8|4.0|Needless to say Vivian Maier was an amazing photographer and these are fantastic pictures. However I was surprised to discover that the images do not enlarge as images do in other kindle books. Additionally the copy is virtually unreadable since the text size is not changeable nor do those pages zoom. Had I known this I would have just purchased the physical book.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|Charming story and graphics were a guilty pleasure but it's time to do some laundry.  Highly recommend for any age.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I found the book to be immensely satisfying, but it is imperative that the first two volumes be read in proper order.  One can only guess what great novels Stieg Larsson might have given us had he not left us soon.
160774273X|1.0|The inside cover of this book says that this book and its recipes are \\"suited for the home baker\\" and \\"Whether you're a total beginner or a serious baker, FWSY has a recipe that suits your skill level and time constraints...\\"  These statements could not possibly be farther from reality.  I am an extremely advanced home chef.  I found the recipes poorly written (far too wordy), difficult (even the \\"easy\\" ones), and with incorrect measurements.  His basic bread recipe is easily short 1/8 to 1/4 cup water, and for a so-called expert, that is unacceptable.  This author also obviously did not try to make his recipes functional for the vast majority of home bakers.  Unless you have lots of time, have nothing else to do, and have lots of space and equipment, I don't see how you can find this book of use.<br />I bought this book to see if I could learn anything to make my home pizzas better.  My pizza crust recipe is far superior to his, not in the final result as both are delightful, but in ease, duplicability, and time required.  I use a super easy overnight sour-dough recipe in the stand mixer that literally takes 10 minutes of actual work time.<br />I have over 100 cookbooks of all sorts.  This may be the worst one I have ever purchased.  You have been warned.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I've always been a big fan of this guy's directing acumen. (Jackie Brown notwithstanding) He pulls it off again, with a great (fictional) story and awesome characters, who are developed perfectly.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|In a number...10. Hugh Howey penned a must read and hopefully subsequent books will pay him handsomely for his creative, ingenious efforts.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|I had high hopes for this re-make of an action movie. The effects are good, but the same effect is used too often, so it loses its charm about 10 minutes in. (SPOILER) You never see Judge Dredd's face! WTF. that was very disappointing...
B00DIJQAI6|1.0|Great. Lame. Buy it. I hats Sonic. Buy it. It is amazing. No one likes Sonic. Except for me. Sonic sucks.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great hidden items game with some logic and thought. Just have to wait sometimes. Enjoyed playing makes me think and use some strategy
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Using this to stream items from my Netflix account as well as from my home server.  Vs something like the Roku, I really can't complain as it uses the cloud to get the content.  I would do some research on the features of this unit vs something like Roku and AirPlay as this isn't necessarily a plug in and you expect it do what you expect it to do.  It's more along the lines of it does things that other similar products do but it's just another tool in the toolbox that you have to figure out for yourself how to use it.  So, don't just go out and buy this because it's a cheaper alternative.  Cheaper yes, but not without its potential as developers should have a field day with this thing in making usable apps.  Highly recommended.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game. You have to be patient with your building because the funds don't come very fast. Graphics are very good. Realistic
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Its fast and not much hassel its great, it download my fav videos and they are crystal clear  even offline.
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|Watched this movie with my kids, it was a very entertaining kid-friendly horror movie with an important lesson about bullying. Some parts were a little scary for my 6 year old daughter, but my 8 year old son was glued from start to finish.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable book that smacks some truth after recent news stories about email snooping.  A storyline that will entertain geeks and action seekers.  Well written and highly recommended. One of Mr Brown's best.

B00CKR63F2|4.0|Beyond Bridalveil Fall (Dwellers Of Ahwahnee) will appeal to lovers of paranormal romance, mythology and the Clan of the Cavebear series. The writer manages to combine Indian legends and mythology with modern-day sentiment and neatly packs it all into a story anyone who has grown a bit weary of the \\"same old, same old\\" in paranormal romance will appreciate.<br /><br />The main character, Oria, is someone many young girls will relate to. She's at that cusp of childhood and womanhood and nervous about finding her way in the world. While celebrating her eighteenth birthday in Yosemite National Park, she goes into the pool at the bottom of Bridalveil Fall and comes out on the other side . . . which is actually a world beyond our world. This world is full of shape shifters that protect our world from the evils that threaten it. It's a neat parable to life as many young people know it nowadays. Who hasn't looked around the crazy times we live in and wondered how they will ever be able to make a difference in a world fraught with challenges and unexplainable terrors?<br /><br />It turns out that the people of this otherworld are afraid too; afraid they won't be able to contain the evil that exists forever. Without giving away the plot, I'll say that Oria plays a big part in their plans to contain the evil once and for all.<br /><br />I'm giving the book four stars because it's different, cleverly weaving in Indian folklore and wisdom into a modern tale. Sometimes, there's a little too much \\"wise old people telling what's going on\\" when there could have been action showing us instead. This is one of those series that I think will only get better with time, as the writer gets deeper into the story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is so cool you can play and its for free so download now and I was so happy to have this game and I think that you will enjoy this game too! have a great time playing this game because I love it.
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|nice idea/ functions well/ &amp; great design. But drawing crude lines to watch sugar fill a vessel turned out to be not my cup of tea. Not as fun as I thought it would be-- shocker! Kids would enjoy it a lot more I'm sure.
B000TGJ7ZY|4.0|Full disclosure: I did not purchase this through Amazon.  I both own and enjoy the film.  Why did I give it only four stars?  Two words: Keanu Reeves, in one of the most monumental Hollywood miscastings since Richard Gere played King David.  How Coppola could produce such a good movie, and yet make such a huge blunder, is beyond me.  Perhaps he was looking for box office draw, but it was such a disappointment; the movie was THIS close to being perfect.  Then Keanu Reeves comes along and mucks it up.<br /><br />But Dracula is far too strong for Reeves to ruin completely.  I know some have criticized Winona Ryder's performance, but I thought she did a good job.  So did Anthony Hopkins.  But the actor who really shines is Gary Oldman as the Count.  The film was all but ignored at the Oscars, although I think it won (deservedly) for costume design.  I've only read bits of the novel, so I can't say how faithful the film is.  I think the consensus is that while the movie takes liberty with Stoker's text, it is the most faithful adaptation thus far.  Whether that's accurate, I don't know.<br /><br />A/V quality of this 16x9 transfer is very good, and worth upgrading from dvd.  I was impressed enough with the soundtrack that I bought the cd.  One strength of this film was the production design; Coppola deliberately used what were, even in 1992, considered to be outmoded techniques of movie making.  But he did so to evoke an old school feel, and it shows; the results speak for themselves.  These techniques of filming, along with many other subjects and deleted/extended scenes, are present in the special features, which in this case I do suggest watching.  \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is one of four movies I watch every Halloween, the other three being [[ASIN:B002LMSWNC Trick 'r Treat [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B00AEBB9V4 Sleepy Hollow [Blu-ray]]], and [[ASIN:B000228EFO Orgy of the Dead]]. I always watch Dracula second.  The movie does contain a good deal of blood and sexual innuendo, as well as some nudity, but in my opinion none of it was over-the-top or gratuitous.  One of the benefits of watching this film is that you'll get to see Monica Bellucci in the buff, and there's a lot to admire, I assure you.  Even with Reeves' blas&eacute; performance, I recommend buying it.<br /><br />Favorite quote (Oldman as Dracula):  \\"I never drink...wine.\\"<br /><br />Fun fact:  pay special attention to the scene where Dracula goes bonkers over the death of his wife.  The priest in that scene is non other than Anthony Hopkins, although I don't think he is listed as such in the credits.well as some nudity, but in my opinion none of it was over-the-top or gratuitous.

B00CWVFZ8W|5.0|SOO GOOD YOULL LOOVVEE IITTT!! It's so good it made me like wanna watch it 1000 times over and it's amazing😓😅
B00AEBB9V4|4.0|This review is for the new 2013 Blu-ray.  First, let me say right up front that if you have any other Blu-ray versions of the movie, don't bother buying this one.  There is no appreciable difference in A/V quality.  It's certainly not the best 16x9 transfer I've seen, but still worth upgrading from dvd.<br /><br />The story of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman needs no elaboration.  Burton was wise to film it in England; this gave the movie a noticeable Old World ambience, and he masterfully created a gloomy, gothic atmosphere throughout.  Ironically, I thought the best performances were given by the supporting actors, not the main cast.  My understanding is that most British actors earn their chops by performing Shakespeare in local theater companies.  If that's true, it definitely shows.  The soundtrack impressed me so much that I bought the cd.  Bonus features include the ubiquitous \\"making of\\" specials, which I usually find uninteresting (and did so in this case).  There were only three things I did not like about this film.<br /><br />The first was a scene where Crane is examining the body of one of the Horseman's victims, who has (of course) been decapitated.  Crane sprinkles some sort of chemical near the wound, which produces a chemical reaction.  Crane then says, \\"This shows there was a powerful singular thrust to the neck.\\"  Well, duh; the man was DECAPITATED.  The scene should have been edited in post production.<br /><br />The second was a particularly insipid \\"romantic\\" scene between Depp and Ricci.  \\"You CAN do magic!  Teach me!\\"  *groan*<br /><br />The third was the \\"atheists and wiccans are good, Christian believers are bad\\" undercurrent that runs through the entire film.  But despite these reservations, I really enjoyed the movie, and recommend buying it.<br /><br />This is one of four movies I watch every Halloween, the others being [[ASIN:B002LMSWNC Trick 'r Treat [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B000TGJ7ZY Bram Stoker's Dracula [Blu-ray]]], and [[ASIN:B000228EFO Orgy of the Dead]].  I always watch \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" next-to-last, because it has a lighter tone and an upbeat ending.  I don't want my evening to be TOO morbid, after all.  But it's good enough to watch any time of year.<br /><br />Fun fact: Christopher Walken plays the Horseman.  If you've ever seen [[ASIN:B00AEFXR8I Dead Zone, The]], you'll recognize the irony.  In that film, Walken plays an English teacher.  Just before his car accident, he promises his class that next time, they'll review Sleepy Hollow.  Was this behind Burton's casting of Walken in the role?  I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised.<br /><br />Favorite quote (Young Masbeth): \\"Is he dead?\\"<br />Crane replies: \\"That's the problem.  He was dead to begin with!\\"000228EFO Orgy of the Dead]].  I always watch \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" next-to-last, because it has a lighter tone and an upbeat ending.

B005D9MUWY|4.0|This is a good replacement for the stock android keyboard. The letter accuracy and prediction seems better. Deleting words quickly is also easier. Swipe typing is a very will implemented feature but it is hard to use on a small screen. The only complaint I have is that the auto correction can be really pushy when you try to do something beyond just typing a word, such as using dashes and numbers. I also seem to accidentally close it sometimes which is annoying. Overall it is a faster keyboard than stock and worth installing.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The puzzles are mostly pretty easy.  Some require pencil and paper just to remember the sequence of colors, symbols, or numbers.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I really enjoy this app, it's simple to use, attractive to look at, very easy to install and the ease of use is commendable. The only thing I would change is to lose the ads.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We are waiting for season 4 as this program is  a great pleasure to watch over and over , Great show
B008RJFRTK|1.0|I purchased this app ever after I read the review that stated this app did not always work. Well, this app does not always work. When it does work it is great. When it does not work, I get very frustrated. I willingly paid the $5 and would love this app IF it worked every time I need it. I have tried syncing before I leave the house and that does not help. If you need a flaky, sometimes working app, then this is the app for you. If you need a great map app, keep searching.
0307120007|5.0|I chose to buy this book for my son because I loved it as a child. It's a classic children's book<br />that engages all the senses.It's a must-have for your child's library of favorites.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Excellent alternative to MTG, has great graphics, great art, cards actually have some animation that really makes the artwork pop out. Strategy is solid, seems to have plenty of card selection so far, and even has some hero development. Definitely recommend this to any fan of strategy card games like mtg.
B008MM9630|4.0|This is an awesome game with beautiful graphics.  It is very fun.  One time I woke up at about 6 in the morning and played it until about 10 am.  The only problem I have with this game is that one time I went into it and it had a task with a pic of the most adorable kitten in it.  And I was like &quot; Yay!!!!!!! I get to get a super cute kitten in my fairy farm.&quot; But when I looked at the task to find the kitten, it said something about it being in a masquerade box.  What and where in the world is a masquerade box?!?  My Dad realised how much I really wanted the kitty, so he looked it up on the internet for me.  When he finally found it, it said expired back in May.  I don't think that they should still have somethin' as a task when expired before I even had my kindle, little own fairy farm. Please, I'm begging and pleading you, please make it to where I can get my kitty.  Pppppppppplllllllllllllllleeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaasssssssseeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (Long version of please!!!!!!!!!)<br /><br />Even though it has that issue, still get this game.  Remember that you can always delete it if you dislike it.<br /><br />This is one of my fave games.  And it's super addictive!<br /><br />Bye now!

B00CDY6HW6|4.0|Your job is to guide the bunnies to there home. But,to do it, you have to guide them with care. Missing cliff drop offs that can kill them to getting trapped in areas and no way to get out. That is where shovels, stop signs and lightning strikes come in to play. You will have a fun time with this one. But, be ready to use the brain to make your bunnies do the right thing. All-in-all, very fun game.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Lots of theatrics and big moment sound tracks.  I wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised with how well produced this was.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|It wont work for me it keeps not downloading it probably is an awsome game but it wont work on my kindle ):
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Once you get started you can't put it down. The characters are people you may know who work and live in your town.<br />I liked  that we got to see Danny Torrance hit bottom and then rise to be who he was meant to be.<br />I would recommend this book even to those who never read The Shining.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|I like uno, but I shouldn't have to pay to play! Tokens don't regenerate, you'll never draw first. It's a good every once in awhile game, like once a month
B007L3BMGA|2.0|It is very poor writing.. story line is weak and it has no get up and go I think the characters are shallow.  Its ok if you want a light read but would not bother with the others... even the sex is poorly written.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I am into sci-fi and this series takes vampires and were-wolves and brings tem into the believable. The characters live.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|If you have read the Secret then this book will help you understand energy more by giving examples and experiments you can try for yourself. It gives you the next steps to take to help you manifest the life you want.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|I'm at a loss for words to describe this film.  It left me cold.  Jude Law is his usual charming, classy self.  Other than that there's not a reason to watch this.  The plot is interesting for a while but falls apart towards the end.  Steven Soderbergh has done so much better.  This is disappointing.

A fictional account of the rise of the Tokugawa Shogun, Mr. Clavell did a masterful job of explaining the intrigue of political power in late Sixteenth Century Japan.<br />This book should be at the top of everyone's list!!
B00BSZZA3I|1.0|Very flimsy design. Cover wouldn't stay closed. I put it back in the box and returned it ASAP. Don't waste your time or money.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|What a great solution for wireless conductivity for the TV. It works great with the only two apps that work with it (Yahoo and Netflix) Thats a whole lot of viewing right there and its worth the price for that alone. The problem for me is when &#34;casting&#34; a tab from the Chrome browser. My computer goes into a state of overheating and the videos are grainy. They do admit that this is still in Beta testing phase and will most likely improve.
B00D6DVSAE|4.0|This is a musical score/soundtrack CD titled 'The Last Ship' (20 tracks) for the Broadway play The Last Ship which will hit the road in 2014. The Broadway play The Last Ship is the story about the demise of the shipbuilding industry in the 80s in Newcastle, UK and Sting has been working on it for the past three years. The songs in this mellow CD cover classical, celtic folk and cabaret musical styles in great orchestral arrangement form with a lot of violin playing. Sting is really great at vocals in this CD.<br /><br />Guest artists include Jimmy Nail in the up-tempo celtic track \\"What Have We Got?\\" & \\"Shipyard\\" (this cabaret track also features Jo Lawry and Brian Johnson lead singer of heavy metal band AC/DC. Brian Johnson is also featured in another cabaret track \\"Sky Hooks And Tartan Paint\\"), Becky Unthank in the orchestral \\"So To Speak\\" and Rachel Unthank And The Winterset in the cabaret track \\"Peggy's Song\\".<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are the tracks \\"The Last Ship\\" (wonderful opening and title track, great vocals & melody. A classical/folk track, great orchestral base track), \\"Dead Man's Boots\\" (similar in arrangement as the title track), \\"Practical Arrangement\\" (beautiful orchestral sound, great melody & vocals), \\"The Last Ship (Reprise)\\" (with great violin play and beautiful rappy vocals by Sting) & the closing track \\"Practical Arrangement (Full Original Duet)\\" (a wonderful jazzy/folk arrangement, no pun intended, featuring Jo Lawry).<br /><br />On overall, this is a musical score/sound track for the Broadway play The Last Ship which will hit theatres in 2014: a combination of classical, celtic, folk & cabaret musical styles in orchestral arrangements and is produced by legendary producer Rob Mathes. It's far miles better than the mellow seasonal traditional folk CD titled 'If On A Winter's Night' released in 2009. If you like orchestral musical scores for Broadway plays or movies, you'll love this CD (great arrangements, wonderful musical execution and excellent production).

B00DGGIXS6|4.0|Legendary veteran singer/actress Cher is back in 2013 with a new CD release titled 'Closer To The Truth' (11 tracks). It's her first studio album in 12 years since 2001's CD 'Living Proof'. Her 1998 CD release 'Believe' from which the mega dance hit & title track \\"Believe\\" relauched her musical career into the stratosphere. This new CD has seven electronica-dance (techno-dance) tracks (tracks 1 through 7 which I call Part One) and four pop-rock tracks (tracks 8 through 11 which are call Part Two).<br /><br />Part One (Seven tracks): these are electronica-dance tracks, quite good track I may add. Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are the tracks \\"My Love\\" (wonderful melody and vocals. The track is the mold of \\"Believe\\" including special voice effects & \\"Lovers Forever\\" (wonderful electronic orchetral base track, melody & vocals). The track \\"Dressed To Kill\\" sounds very similar to Taylor Dayne's 80s track \\"Listen To Your Heart\\". If you like electronica-dance-pop music you'll love this part as she really good at it.<br /><br />Part Two (Four tracks): great pop-rock tracks. I really like the orchestral base tracks in the songs \\"I Hope You Find It\\" & the closing \\"Lie To Me\\". Stand-out/gems/my favourite is the incredible track \\"Sirens\\" (beautiful melody & great vocals). This is my favourite part of this CD. I must confess my favourite Cher CD is the 1995 'A Man's World' (a pop-rock album) and prefers her pop-rock side of her artistry. .<br /><br />On overall, Cher has great electronica-dance-pop (seven tracks) and pop-rock (four tracks) album in this new CD 'Closer To The Truth'. A recommended CD listening.

B00DAPOHU6|4.0|This is a quite notable follow-up to the 2010 well received CD release titled 'To The Sea' by maestro of surf folk-rock singer-songwriter and guitarist Jack Johnson. In this new CD release titled 'From Here To Now To You' (12 tracks), Jack Johnson (JJ) uses acoustic guitar to compose and play/record the new songs but his main formula remains the same (style of his guitar playing, song arrangement and the choice of titles of songs/stories eg \\"Washing Dishes\\", \\"Shot Reverse Shot\\", \\"As I Was Saying\\" & \\"Ones And Zeros\\" in this CD as compared to \\"No Good With Faces\\", \\"At Or With Me\\", \\"Pictures Of People Taking Pictures\\" & \\"Anything But The Truth\\" in the CD 'To The Sea'. May be his acoustic inclination (with resultant great guitar chords and finger pick-ups I may add) in this new CD is a natural progression from his 2012 live CD release titled 'Best Of Kokua Festival'. JJ re-unites with producer Mario Caldato (produced bestselling 2005's 'In Between Dreams') and slide-guitar maestro singer-songwriter Ben Harper in this new CD 'From Here To Now To You'. JJ and Ben Harper played live together in 2006 at Kokua Festival, Hawaii in the wonderful track \\"High Tide Or Low Tide\\" which is included in the CD 'Best Of Kokua Festival' as well as he being featured in JJ's first ever single \\"Flake\\".<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are the tracks \\"I Got You\\" (wonderful opening mid-tempo track, great guitar playing, melody & vocals), \\"Washing Dishes\\" (beautiful up-tempo track with great guitar chords, melody and vocals), \\"Don't Believe A Thing I Say\\" (great guitar finger pick-ups, melody &  vocals), \\"As I Was Saying\\" & my pick for the best track from this great album \\"Change\\" (slow-tempo track, great violin playing & melody and this track has a refreshing arrangement as compared to the other 11 similarly arranged tracks).<br /><br />On overall, Jack Johnson doesn't disappoint in this new CD 'From Here To Now To You': great compositions on acoustic guitar, good musical execution and production. If you liked the CD 'To The Sea', you'll definitely love this album. A recommended CD listening.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I always enjoy reading Baldacci and look forward to reading more in the future. The best crime novels by far!
0802714544|1.0|I would gladly give stars for John Le Carre's classic if I could rate the hardcover edition separately.  This new Walker & Company edition, though, is criminally bad.  There are typos throughout--obviously they used text recognition scanning from a previous edition and didn't bother to proofread.  The print and layout is OK, but the paper is the kind you'd expect in a mass-market paperback.  This is the kind of hardcover that didn't exist before folks bought books online, sight unseen.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE!!! EVERY TIME I WATCH IT, I LOVE IT MORE AND MORE!!! THIS MOVIE WILL NEVER GET OLD TO ME!!!
B002V091IO|4.0|This is a very well written love story.<br />I couldn't put it down.<br />I will definitely recommend this book to friends.
1623650003|5.0|This is the best mystery I've read in years.  I still haven't decided how I feel about the ending -- who do I believe?  What is really incredible is that the detectives go on after the suicide to find out the whole story.  Do detectives really have that kind of time or caseload to keep at the solved cases?  I hope so.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|An excellent book devoted to information about the universe that is clearly presented with relative examples to aid in understanding science in our daily lives.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|For all those wanting to understand what life in North Korea might be like, this book is an excellent option.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This book got two stars from me because it wasn't as good as it looks but that doesn't mean you can't read it and see if you enjoy it more than I did. I would also recommend that you should be at the last 18 years of age too read this. And that's the minimum.
B00BS3EMNY|5.0|When I first saw her on the Jools Holland show, my jaw dropped with the first notes from her mouth. And talk about clever lyrics! My favorites are Come Back As a Man and Liquid Lunch, but not a cut disappoints. Everyone who has heard her has asked, &#34;Where did she come from?&#34; The Netherlands via England barely scratches the surface; her American movie and cultural references, the non-intrusive background noises and voices that actually add to the songs, drum programming that doesn't detract, and the jazz and hip hop touches that move the music smoothly from the past into the future speak of far more wide-ranging influences and a highly credible desire for experimentation. I want to know when I can hear her live, and I want to see where she takes the music next!
1476727651|5.0|I thought this was a great book. I really enjoyed learning what happened to Danny,and how his life was going. After all he went through,I wasn.t surprized that he was slowly killing himself with booze. Been there,done that. Glad to see he turned his life around. Some people think ALL Kings books should scare the s*** out of them. I don.t. I love his books for the characters,theres always more than horror in his stories...theres people you want to know,people you love and people you dont. It was good to see Danny again. If you loved the shining,the stand,it.....etc....you will truely enjoy doctor sleep.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is sooooo Steve Carell!  Very cute, warm and very, very funny!  Reminds me of another Carell family movie -- Dan In Real Life. This is whole-family fun!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is really awesome I just can't stop playing the game. Anybody who don't have this game need to buy it.
1491054484|4.0|The author, Stefan Wintermeuyer, does not speak English as his birth language, but the grammatical and spelling flaws affect less than 1/2% of the text and it's easy to deal with.<br /><br />He's a master of Ruby and Rails, and the subjects are covered quickly but quite comprehensively. I used this book as a returning coder coming back to Rails after more than half a decade dealing with much less elegant languages that shall remain nameless.<br /><br />But, enough about him and me.<br /><br />The why: This is the first (and currently only) book out on Rails 4.0. It's plenty good enough even for a neophyte with little programming experience. Lots of workable examples.<br /><br />I learned a lot more about Ruby and Rails even than I'd forgotten. It's well laid out and deals with a number of topics such as internationalization and site caching in much better ways than I've seen in any other Rails book. The author also gives a short but potent example of production deployment using Unicorn and nginx, again a rarity in any form.<br /><br />Is this the only Rails 4 book you'll need or want? Probably not, if you're a production coder, but you can probably keep going with Rails 4 until Obie Fernendez comes out with his latest take on The Rails Way.<br /><br />I was quite satisfied with this book. Well worth its price.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|You people out there with a android tablet or phone need to get this game!!!I promise it is awesome trust me I played the first 3 levels and I like it.BUY IT TODAY!!!!!!!
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Great action sequences and character development<br />Wonder where Tony Stark goes next - How does his surgery affect the suit?
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Amazing research and we'll documented. I grew up in this age and never knew about these accidents and near misses. I read this in several days.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|What a great update to the Holmes story - can't wait to see how he survived the fall and what cases he takes on next.
B004GYY714|5.0|Easy to find radio stations. Perfect sound. I can even listen in my car's sound. This is really great !!!
B003XE1DR4|5.0|A very comfortable fit. I also have other crocs but this one I can dress up and wear or be casual.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book had a different story line than your typical romance book. It also had a happy ending. I would recommend it.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|awesome game I like all the different games with in the game. gameloft thank u...onky thing is it doesn't connect to my facebook.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The Battery HD Free App is great. I've had it installed on my Kindle Fire HD for several months and I use it often. It consistently gives me accurate read-outs. It gives you many types of information. I wouldn't be without it. Highly recommend.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have NEVER been interested in anything like this until my sister told me if I read it I would wish I knew this guy. Well, of course, I had to do it then and she wasn't kidding! Holy crap, it almost hurts to know that this is fiction. It made me want more so I started in on another series by Sylvia Day, I have been sucked into Erotic Romance, Help! Enough said.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|The actual phone alarm is awful. This one is much better and totally worth the purchase. I love that when you scroll the minutes, it'll flip to the next 15 minute increment. No awful typing in the numbers. And there's a stopwatch function. Great interface.
B000ID37RM|5.0|We watched the movie after reading the book.  It was very enjoyable and a good lesson, as well!  A must-see!
B00DURHYWC|5.0|Another fantastic listening experience.  Love every song but some are just unbelievably melodic.  This is a must buy for any Martini fan.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think who ever put one star for this game was completely out of their mind. This game is one of my favorites.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book made me want to read again. I loved the journey of learning to live when you never learned to love yourself
B00633W614|3.0|Plot slowed down.... Not boring but I wish archer would move the plot along in a quicker pace. A bit disappointed
B0054JZC6E|4.0|If you like simple games you can master to beat your score or your buddies and if you like games where you play to unlock stuff, then this is a game for you
B008NMT684|5.0|When Papa is bored I give my Kindle to our toddler and the two of them have long conversations about Trucks, buses, vans and everything ilse that hauls heavy stuff.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Pretty entertaining. Great effects.  RDjr is hilarious as always. Hulk playing with the punny god is the best scene in the movie
B003UBTX6S|4.0|What a boom I swear I couldn't put my kindle down for a second I even went to the bathroom to keep reading. I absolutely praise this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can't get my eyes off the app<br /><br />I recommend this app  because it is amazing<br /><br />Subway surfers  is the best app<br />Subway surfers is very simple 1st you choose a character then<br />you press the app it will start
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This alarm is awesome helped so much like the dimer option and all the other option like all the different clocks.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|wicked awesome production right here! action over flowing and a great story with a well measured amount of humor from the Hulk and of course Robert Downey Jr.,my take is its well worth the watch. just a great great film.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|They have you buying with a lot of fake cash with you have to pay for.  I know they want to make money. They should at least make it an option to use coins when they are giving you the task ( like have a black cat ) well you have to use fake cash. Also I don't get a chance to do a lot of building things and what not. I'm trying to keep the people from dying. As soon as I heal a person, another gets sick. They usually need same thing. I've sold the headstones, to help buy crops. I always get hit with a lot of storms that if you have the means to buy all of the fake cash you want you won't have any issues. Thinking about deleting game. I'm spend more time healing people than anything
B009FXIICK|3.0|I generally like match-3 games with a twist but this one is not very interesting. The graphics and game play are simplistic and the animals are not very cute or attractive at all.  To level up you have to match a certain number of each type of animal. It starts out relaxed but as you level up you have to match more and more of each type within a shorter amount of time. By around level 5 it's already very fast. And that's the game... nothing new happens as you advance to each level.  You just have to start over once you fail. It could be addictive for a while but it's too ugly and gets annoyingly fast too soon for me to want to keep playing.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|awhile back I played this on the DS and beat it..... months later I find this...exited for possible new levels but to my disappointment its the EXACT same thing as the DS version......same levels and same things....and it charges you for more levels while if you get the DS version you get everything..jeez...what a diasapointment
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|I like what Bruce Willis delivers to his action movies. John McClain goes through hell and back but it is a fun ride to go on with him.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great read that held my attention and ended up being a profound and wonderful story about the complicated and intricate entanglement of our human lives.  Warm and very real.  Excellent work. I'm glad I stopped and read this book.  Thank you Ms Moriarty.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|This was a fun movie. I know it didn't do well at the box office but my boys and I enjoyed watching this. Arnold never lets you down.
B00B7ERH04|2.0|I don't get it... it says I need to pay ten camcoins after recording two videos or get the PRO version, which costs 1.99$. I'm afraid it won't let me take pictures, also. I hate these free versions of awesome camera apps because you can only get on the app one time then it says you can't do anything after that! Don't get this and get the PRO version (or any other 5 star camera apps, maybe 4 star)!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Jamie Foxx does a wonderful job on playing Django. The storyline is great. The fight for freedom and revenge .
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a great app for all ages but, After I had this app for several months and spent money on the game to get more pearls..<br />Now I get a message saying I don't own this app.<br />I am a little frustrated after getting to level 25 and spending money (several times )looks like Someone would help fix this issue..I sent a message...<br /> have not received a reply.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|I have not listened to Carol King since the '80 s . Boy, did I miss her!  My husband and enjoyed this classic album of hers and brought back memories.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's super fun and you don't get tired of it. I would totally like if they made more places for us to go to but I just have to wait.
B005LAII4E|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It had a lot of action pack fun. The best part of the movie is when Bruce Willis enters the scene. Great action!
B009DCOU9S|1.0|Again I'm very disappointed with one of your games. There is way too much story. And the mini games are really bad. Too much time waiting after you hit hint for it to recharge. And if u don't tap the exact place on the objects it will not pick up. I love hidden object games but this one...? Don't waste time or money
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie in the theatre. I had to add this to our collection. Awesome! Robert Downey Jr you are my Iron Man!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Entwined With You was a great disappointment. The storyline is not progressing and I am sick of the cliffhangers at the end. No matter what I will not continue the series. I am sick of the promiscuous Eva. She says she loves Gideon but her actions show she is not really committed to their relationship. She is just a spoiled brat. I am sick of Cary, her best friend that I liked in the first book Bared To You. I am sick of reading the detailed rape scenes or dreams in each book. I get it! both Eva and Gideon were viciously raped when they were just children. I hate reading about rape and don't understand how this makes a romance story romantic. I am just Done with the Crossfire series!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once I started reading I could not stop. Great mixture of supernatural and good old fashioned creepiness. Reads like screenplay.
B0006J28BO|5.0|Considering this was released ages ago, my little girl still loves this movie. And now my son jumped into loving it as well.
B00E89VXQY|1.0|I'll not discuss the sound quality of this album. It's ok, great. BUT... My 1 star is only a complaint: I did not want Nothing else matters, Master of Puppets etc. being released for the \\"N\\" time. Metallica is becoming a nostalgia act, in my opinion. I prefer Megadeth releasing bad new material (see Super Collider) than Metallica.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I used to have the old VHS version of this movie and lost it. When it was re-released and re-dubbed, and some additional scenes as opposed to the old release, this was a complete surprise.
B005544V6A|5.0|I'm addicted to this show. The acting is amazing. Wonderful suspense. Great characters. I'm trying to pace myself so I don't watch all the episodes in one weekend! Highly recommend this show.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like to be able to see what the weather is going to be in multiple places.  It is easy to use.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|And the Mountains Echoed is the ultimate page turner. As soon as i finished it I wanted to reread it.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|I enjoy watching this movie.  I like both actors.
B0014DFCMS|1.0|I didn't get a blu-ray copy. I got two DVD (computer download) copies. So really they're not even DVDs! Amazing.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book was awesome .one of the best .I loved how there was a twist in the end. 5 stars
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|I have yet to see a huge difference but will update if any issues. uploaded well. User friendly.  used little space to run.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like MINIONS you will love this game!!! You get to battle El Maco and Vector and some girl, you get to see all of the Despicle Me characters and you have challenges. It is so fun,I love it!!
B00003CXAE|3.0|It doesn't compare to Saturday night live, by being a sequel I thought it would be similar meaning disco.  Love the actors.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Beautifully written powerful story showing what it was like for everyday German's to live under the fuhrer.  The characters draw you in with such power you feel like they are right there telling their story.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Final scene is epic.  Can't go wrong with FMJ!!  See how many current stars are in this great movie.  Watch again.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I'm new to games and I just want to say how much fun I am having with this app!  It's easy for me to play and enjoy.
0142403873|5.0|Another adorable tale that children will all enjoy. My five year old wants to read this book every night. Our whole family enjoyed it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|By the end of Season 3, I'm fully involved with all the characters.  I did not want to see it end.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|I recommend this for any Monster High fan. My little sister very much enjoyed these movies as she is a Monster High fanatic.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|You know a book is good when you can't put it down until it's over. And when you wish it hadn't ended but would go on for a few chapters more. These characters are just so rich they are real. Now I will forever be looking for a sequel with Abra, hint hint!
0142501123|5.0|This story is adorable and catchy. My five year old caught on to the pattern very quickly and requests to read it over and over again. I highly recommend this book for a cute Halloween story.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|The car charger does what it is suppose to do.  It is great for charging my ipad on the go and also works well for my phone.
B000WCDBKM|5.0|Johnny Depp is phenomenal in The Ninth Gate. This movie is suspenseful, interesting and definitely keeps you guessing the whole way through!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game because it has dress up and I like dress up. I also like running games and I like the details.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Definitely read! Best book yet!! Couldn't put it down all day!!! Won't be disappointed in this wonderfully portrayed love story.
B00DQVST76|5.0|Madonna's 'MDNA' tour dvd is a beautiful extravaganza.<br />For Madonna afcionados and live music concert dvds, 'MDNA' features Madonna<br />at her stunningly most beautiful!<br /><br />~Reynaldo C. 'Joy of Writing Haikus'
B004LROUNG|5.0|Funniest John Grisham book I've read .Yet the characters were believable and I really cared how it turned out .His last few books kinda disappointed me, but this was enjoyable.
1612680011|4.0|This book can be a real eye-opener, as it was for me. Some of the comments that are negative (which give examples of how Robert is incorrect, immoral, or illegal) are written from a very ignorant and poor point of view. One of the lessons in his book is comparing wealth creation from where you are to where you want to be, to traveling from the state of Hawaii to the state of New York. The fastest way is usually the most expensive, while there are less expensive ways but these will take more time. The same applies to wealth creation, it takes work, dedication, enthusiasm, time, and sacrifice. If you're not willing to do that, than you're not willing to live the life of wealth.<br /><br />Overall, a really good book to get started on the road to wealth.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a very good app.....I love the features......makes waking up fun.....lol.....I will buy other apps made by this company.......thank you
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I loved this book from the beginning, although I couldn't tell where it was going.  I love the pictures and how they are tied into the story-- how truly original and intriguing.  The storytelling, and characters, are wonderful-- evocative of Lemony Snicket.<br /><br />I liked it a bit less when it seemed to turn into something very similar to a Percy Jackson adventure, and I am not at all sure I understand the gods and monsters and time travel aspects of this young adult novel.<br /><br />I was hoping for a good ghost story, which this is not, but at least it's not vampires and werewolves, either.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS BOOK...  If you don't mind abnormal sex, today's gutter language and gore,I guess you might make it through.  I made it to the second chapter and deleted it from my Kindle.  It is also a confusing book to me.  You did not get any background to the characters,  where they were,  who was getting killed or no.<br />I think it is an insult to JRR Tolkien to compare this author to him.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Fun to play on any divice. Build carts and get maps. Fun for ages 8-14. If you like angry birds then this is the game for you
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Great compilation of some of IZ's best stuff. If only going to have one of IZ's albums, to me it's a toss up between this and Facing the Future. But why have only one? Great voice and great songs. IZ, you left us way too soon, but you left us richer for the time you were here with us.
B00EP0KYDO|5.0|Personally, I loved this movie. The movie contains all the elements for a good action/drama/thriller scifi. You have a setting far in the future where the human race has settled on another world following the collapse of the Earth's ecosystem, and it's inability to sustain the human population any more. Then there is the strained relationship of the father and son. Then the ship they are on is seriously damaged, and they are forced to make a crash landing on the one planet they are prohibited from landing on, Earth. The father is seriously injured in the crash, the rest of the crew dies, and it is up to the son to navigate the hostile environment, find the other half of the ship which broke apart on entry, and activate an emergency beacon so they can be rescued. What follows is a thrilling adventure as the son navigates the familiar, yet alien Earth of the far future, and the father is forced to watch from the confines of the crashed ship as his son encounters danger after danger.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I have always had a fascination for this part of history and this book did not disappoint. I could not put it down and was sad whe it ended!
B00DHRLK84|3.0|The Z is for Zombie, well Zeeks actually but who cares. Its a decent movie if held on its own, however if your a fan of the book you will likely be disappointed.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen king out does himself!  Every bit as good as the shiningnnim so glad I got to find out what happened to Danny
B004QZ9P6K|5.0|It just inspired me what a thread country is up to do with just the potential of their people and their brains. The book guys rules!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A fun game for people all over the world full of excitement and a huge rush. Many people would enjoy this game.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best keyboard on android. Great replacement keyboard. Better than having a physical keyboard. Social linking let the SwiftKey learn how you type over time.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I really liked this book. It's so much easier to understand than most of these other books. I like that she's easy to  understand. I think this a good book to have on hand if you loose the mind frame.
B008XG1X18|1.0|This used to be something I used daily on my Kindle Fire. But after last update it is now worthless. I can't pin a thing because every time I try to it force closes. Fix this app please! I miss using it!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good quick read. Love the way all the lives entwined. Epilogue was the best part. Put all those questions you usually have at the end of books to rest. Really enjoyed it.
B00899DV6O|1.0|artists like this makes me lose faith in the modern generation. the \\"popular\\" music these days can been getting worse and worse. people need to learn what good music is
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I've been waiting for this movie from the moment I heard there's going to be one. I've read the book before, and was really curious how they're going to take the book, with its multiple different storylines and characters, and merge them into a common storyline - and movie. Well, they simply didn't.<br /><br />To make a long story short (literally), the movie has nothing to do with the book it's named after. They both speak of zombies, they both speak of a former UN employee running around the world, but that's where the similarities end. Having said that, the fact the movie has nothing to do with the book does not justify the (so many) bad critics I've heard about this movie, which - while not being the best ever - was definitely not a bad one.<br /><br />The movie has lots of good action scenes, it has reasonable scary scenes, and while one may think that the entire \\"concept\\" of \\"zombies\\" is impossible - the human reactions to them in the movies were something any human being should be able to relate to and learn from.<br /><br />Bottom line - a good movie, recommended even if you're not into zombie-movies, but are okay with some gory, scary scenes.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app. It is very helpful &amp; creates amazing collages with great edits. It works good on almost any device
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wow!  Who could not give this Book five stars!!  My first complete reading of the Holy Bible is being done with my YouVersion ap on my Kindle Fire.  I started the chronological plan and am in to day 212, should finish by next spring.  Love the way it keeps track for me, let's me bookmark, and make notes.  Lots more that I haven't had time to explore.  Also, I'm reading the NIV version, but there are many other versions than the King James and NIV.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I got this app for free. It was free for one day, and its original price is $15, so I know it wasn't something to pass up on. I got, used it, and loved it! It had an easy-to-use word starter that would make Microsoft proud, and you can also make power presentations and much more. Whenever it updates, it always adds some new, helpful feature that will improve your experience with this app. I am writing a book right now with it, and things are going really well! Even though very few of you will get it for free, its still all-out worth the money! A must buy for anybody!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm not going to lie; I was scared to death to read this book. Not because I thought it would be scary -- I knew it would -- but because The Shining is my favorite Stephen King book, and I never thought he could follow it up, never ever.<br /><br />He did. This book is written by a different author than the Steve King who wrote a book about a man who saved his son, even when he couldn't save himself; this is written by an author who has dried out and settled down, who has stared death in the face, and lived to hold his grandkids.<br /><br />Through it all, King's brilliant touch for creating PEOPLE instead of just CHARACTERS holds; there's not a single person in the book who feels typical to me, which is surprising when your cast is made up of recovering AA dudes, brilliant kids, and scared parents, all familiar territory for King. Dan is the boy who has had to learn how to survive life, after surviving the Overlook, and what he's had to do to get where he is isn't pretty. But it's beautiful.<br /><br />This book scared me to bits, and made me cry more than once. I love it. I absolutely love it.
B002APU580|4.0|This is such an awesome movie!  It's so great! No nearly as good as the 6-hr version though. If you haven't seen that, you should.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Started  off well, than slow . I took a small break from reading it for a few weeks. Than came back to it, un-read books drive me crazy so I had to finish it. Starting picking up in the end.<br /><br />Still enjoyed the first two better, the movies are trash.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|This book was good but then boring it had lots I mean lots of information but this book I would like to read one more time
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|Outstanding movie! Great entertainment and full of suspense. Will keep you at the edge of your seat. Young Smith was wonderful and full of emotions. We highly recommend this family oriented movie to everyone. I give it an irrefutable 5 stars. Ignore the dumb and clueless remarks of the critics!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|wonderful game. the kids enjoy it and so do I. to earn points is a little difficult unless your willing to spend real money however they do post sales on tokens. The tokens are not needed however if you are looking to play a game.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|This book is very useful. For people who need higher vocabulary this would be the book for you. Well known
B007QUUIEA|3.0|A good book and nice and easy to read and I can see that it is very relative to our society, but I found it a bit slow and dull and didn't really enjoy the plot.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|If my desert island allowed just one CD by the genius songwriters of Dylan/ Paul Simon/ Joni Mitchell generation (that is, people who came to prominence in the Sixties but were born before the explosion in Hiroshima, the surrender of the Axis, and the start of the Cold War) I would have no trouble choosing - it would be this one. Hey, I'm a word guy, and Leonard Cohen is unsurpassed when it comes to sheer wordcraft. And then there are the emotions and ideas he explores, which resonate with me more than anyone else's do. That's just me - you may well resonate differently - but you still need at least one Cohen CD. And it should be this one.<br />Why THIS disc among all the Cohen options? To begin with, it's a superbly curated greatest hits collection. Second, the performances often surpass the studio in power AND richness AND refinement. Gotta praise the music director or whoever was responsible for the arrangements, and the musicians themselves, who play like inspired angels. The backup singers, Sharon Robinson and the Webb Sisters, surpass themselves -  they reach perfection, never overwrought yet deeply feeling and expressing their meanings. As for Cohen's voice, it is older, deeper and gravelier than ever, which suits the meaning and the words that much more. The great lyrics - none are lost or mumbled, some are slightly reworked to their benefit (\\"a tree where the doves love to die,\\" as opposed to \\"go to die\\"). And there's just the right element of \\"speaking\\" in the singing, something that all great singing has.<br />And then there's Cohen the great performer interacting with an ideal audience. The exchange of delight, wit, and love, the easy rapport - THIS is what a great live performance can do that studio wizardry cannot touch, and it really comes through.<br /> If you don't yet own a Cohen CD, make this one your first; if you already do own some, make this the next. That pretty much covers everybody, right?
B008TMA1LY|4.0|I'm Ellie and this game is so cute.I like it but it is very fun but at like level 4 it is so hard it took me almost 2mknths and I'm only eight.I know how to spell.all those grownups who think I cant well your wrong.I bet a child never said that to you.ha.Id also like to say hi to Georgia king and Kayden vest and Renee Moran.I love you guys.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was surprised at how much I liked it, I liked it enough to read the second book. Eleven words
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|After setup and trying chromecast, it lost connection to my wifi network.<br />Google isn't very helpful in their instructions about how to re-connect.<br />It's a catch-22.  You need to connect, in order to connect.<br />Features are limited: Netflix and YouTube.  I can get these via my blu-ray player.<br />Any smart TV has the same capability, and more.<br />I may eventually figure this connection thing out.<br />But, it's not as simple as Google claims.<br />And I really can't afford another time-wasting techie device sucking up my time.<br />Back to my blu-ray player.  No more chromecast.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|These two talented musicians/singers are wonderful together. This isn't my favorite CD of theirs but was well worth purchasing. Love their sound.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I just really like this game it's fun you can build places you can battle you can add<br />friends  I really like it :-)
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The game provides challenges of many types.  It is a bit confusing at first but is getting better as I play.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|One of the best series I've read. I personally loved the fact that the book made me feel like I was in story. I would recommend this book to kids in middle school.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This show never disappoints . . . its always a spellbinding, nonstop storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Look out, Season 11 is now underway!
B0058OUJA4|5.0|I got this game on a whim because it was free that day through Amazon's app.<br />GREAT DESICSION!<br /><br />I play this game a lot, and love the new levels! You can create your own levels and everything, I think that's one of the coolest features. The game is simple, straight forward, and all about how YOU want to beat each level. Will you upgrade what you have or make more towers?<br />Very fun!
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|This movie shocked me how great it was.  I wasn't expecting more than a transformers-esque movie.  It was so much better than any of the Transformers movies.  It had a unique story line and I really enjoyed the characters.  The art in this movie is really awe inspiring.
B00DBQ0AV4|5.0|Anna Netrebko's new CD+DVD \\"Anna Netrebko-Verdi\\", the title of her new work involves her ventures into Verdi's<br />heavier music or roles that requires more dramatic singing.  However, Anna doesn't have a heavy dramatic voice, this<br />does not deter her determination to take up dramatic roles, for instance, Lady Macbeth's Sleep Walking scene or in Don Carlo, Elisabetta's big and difficult aria \\"Tu che le vanita...Francia, nobile suol\\", ETC.  To me, she did quite<br />well even though her voice is too beautiful for Lady Macbeth's music. As for Leonora's scena in \\"Il Trovatore\\", this item is not new to her fans or admirers; she did it successfully about two years ago in a concert in Germany,  with Jonas Kaufmann as her Manrico.  This time, equally successful but with Rolando villazon as her Manrico.<br />Villzon, is also very good in this, he shows no trace of his vocal trouble left over that he suffered a few years<br />ago. All in all, she did very well in all the items of this CD, especially, Elena's coloratura embellishment is quite exciting.<br /><br />The DVD is very satisfactory addition to the CD.  Every item included in it is a GEM.  I like especially that most of the opera arias are reconstructed in modern time, except, 'Lucia di Lammermoor'.  The two items:<br />'Song to the Moon' from RUSALKA and 'Care compagne...Come per me sereno' from LA SONNAMBULA extracted from her debut DVD titled THE WOMAN, THE VOICE, are exceedingly welcome addition.  The director of these two numbers should be awarded for excellence. Anna not only sings beautifully but also dances beautifully; I didn't know fashion for odd balls can be stylish and tasteful too. The SONNAMBULA number is simply delightful.  And 'Song to the Moon', there is no way that Maria Callas can be as sexy as Anna. As I have said before, Anna's voice is too beautiful for some items but she is a big success in this venture.  It shows why she is such a rage in the operatic world, she really stirs it up.<br /><br />I wrote this review as soon as I received the item from AMAZON and listened and viewed both CD & DVD from beginning<br />to end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE this game it is one of the few perfectly free good games you will have fun takeing care of your horse.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great way to keep hour mind active. I like the simplicity of the game; it reminds me of my days in undergrad, a time when this was the only game on your PC.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|Dick Van Dyke plays a single father with two children who tries to make ends meet by creating fanciful inventions.  Nothing seems to work until he finds an old abandoned car.  He works on the car and creates a magnificent vehicle that flies and floats and takes him and his children on a magical adventure.  Wonderful story, great music and lots of fun for all.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|This was a great buy for my kindle fit just perfect light weight easy to clean.overall a great buy. Love it.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Don't expect to see Dorothy and Toto, but this movie explains how the Wizard got to Oz.  Great special effects and good characters plus a wonderful storyline make this movie an instant classic.  One to watch over and over.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Have to admit I'm reviewing this book without having finished it yet.  It's a lengthy read but at half way through I cannot stop reading.  Every spare minute is spent buried within the pages of this intriguing book.  Terry Hayes has crafted something very special.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|OK SO I LOVED IT PLAYED IT ALL DAY NOW I DONT KNOW IF ITS MY KINDLE BUT IT TAKES FOREVER TO LOAD I WOULD NOT GET NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY!!  I WILL GIVE SOME MORE TRIES BUT IT PROBELY WONT WORK
B00E66QPCG|5.0|A straight-forward trading method but also an uplifting and correct attitude toward trading.  With patience to wait for the entry, it's easy to spot.  Take profit is higher than the stop loss so that even a 50% win rate is profitable.
0765334798|5.0|This book was funny as hell. If you're a Star Trek fan then you know what the Red Shirt is. It's very humorous and goes down roads you're not expecting from a novel.
B000VWYNOG|5.0|WOW! Did not realize all the fantastic songs VAN MORRISON had! This is a fantastic c.d at a great price and fast shipping!
B00A7R0JPM|2.0|I hate to give this anything less than five stars because I loved the movie so much, but its been really disappointing.  No matter how many times I try to download the videos, they don't work and I am given the automated message to delete them and to reinstall them.  Other than that, I'm finding it hard to get into the story.  I will persist but it is a bit of a chore.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I played it when it first came out on a android and it sucked played it a minute ago after the update its great it was made for a tablet
B00CH26TL8|5.0|this game that I have been playing is one of the better games and the most understandable of all the games that I play. For the record If you like any game that is a bubble shooter gamee you really need to get this one for your collection.
B00992CF6W|4.0|my younger step sister, Elinor,  has a kindle fire hd and we cant get on her minecraft with our kindles, but she can get on ours. please fix that. Also we want to be able to make TNT explode. in the next update please add flint and steel on the creative mode items and let is be able to get on hers
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|Enjoyed it. I would rethink purchasing if I had known it was a serial, however the movie was good and now I can't wait for the next one.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun game! Love the fast gameplay and selection of areas to play. I disabled chat though , too distracting and sometimes inappropriate.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|For you 3D fans this is a terrific movie. The depth of the 3D effects were incredible and the story is fantastic.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|I am a big fan of this band and this disc is very beatiful and has all the elements that have made Garbage one of my favourites. I would highly recommend the purchase of this product.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|The new cast and crew where picked to perfection. I hope they continue this 2nd movie in the new series for us baby boomers.
B0086AYAQ6|3.0|The artist is wonderful and I think that the song selection is great, but unfortunately the sound of the cd didn't cover my expectations I would have expected a better recording.
B006H5120E|5.0|Great for remake with 3D effects. If you are a fan of the original and have a 3D TV it's one to buy.
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|Fiona Apple is my favourite artist and this work comprises all the musical evolution that she has experienced through this years. As always the music and lyrics are gorgeous and meaningful. I strongly recommend to everybody to give a try to any disc of Fiona.
B003U9W3GM|5.0|Yes the title is a cliche, but when I die and if I go to hell, I do not want to experience anything like that. I really don't know how anyone can return sane from the horrors seen and experienced by Mr. Sledge. This book I read after veiwing the harrowing Blu Ray series The Pacific. I then tried to view a couple of Hollywood war movies and had to turn them off. They were so far removed from what our fathers (and mothers) went through in the Second World War as to be insulting.<br /><br />This book is about as gritty and accurate as you can get. So well written, graphic and engaging but in some ways you wish it wasn't, or that it even needed to be written in the first place, It is tragic that within the nature of man there is this lust for power which causes innocent everyday people to be caught up in the results of the maniacal ravings of meglomaniacs like Hitler and militarists like Japan's Tojo.<br /><br />This book and many like it should be read by all, so that we will always be grateful for the sacrifices that our fathers made for us to live in freedom. It should be read by all , so that the true obscenity of war in all it's forms, be they the depths of barbarity, the horrendous loss of life and those lives that are forever affected by injury to body and mind, become foremost in our own minds so that war will never again be seen to be exciting, entertaining or glamourised.<br />Please read this book and similar books so that we never forget what can happen when the insanity of war starts.
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|Just installed. Very easy  to install and use. Loads the videos on my kindle and one button play. Very easy to use. Good video quality.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I wish I could get some more money for the game so I could buy very single player in the game
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I got this for my grandaughter and she loves it.  She enjoys anything with My Little Pony.  I like it because it is a &#34;nice&#34; game for her to play.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I always enjoy books set in a different country then my own. Liked the colorful characters band the accents.<br />It we easy to imagine all of the settings.
B008478VE8|5.0|Charles Darwin's 'On the Origin of Species' is simply a must read for anyone today. In this simple book is described the mechanism for evolution. Coupled with Gregor Mendel's seminal paper 'Experiments on Plant Hybridization', this gives the student an excellent grounding in evolution and genetics and how they relate to each other.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|This is written with a sense of humor, and she teaches some true principles. The only thing that I didn't relate with was her view of God, which is pretty far off from mine. It's certainly ok that she believes differently from me, it's just that it caused me to have to \\"sift\\" through her opinion to glean out the good stuff. That was only one chapter, though. Other than that, the experiments are really fun to try and I had some awesome experiences!<br /><br />I do recommend this book. It's refreshing, funny, and eye-opening. For those who say it doesn't work, remember....when the student is ready, the teacher appears. You have to be ready and willing to let go of doubt and negativity! For some, that's hard. But, keep trying! Letting go can bring great blessings! Overall, I really liked this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i really like this game.. you can build something from crafts.. it is so cool.. i have this game in my pc too.. this is so nice.. it have survival, creative and hardcore mode.. yeah!!
B008YKGQR4|1.0|SPAM....dont waist a second downloading this.unless you like waisting time and erasing it too. i had to do a master reset. I am using hauawee social phone
B00867GKIK|5.0|This movie is really cute  I  bought the 3d  at the best price I could find ,this movie is  Well worth adding to a collection shipped quickly ,as described
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I have the other 2 quell games and this one is just as good! It has new objectives to make it even more challenging, but doable! The replay on these games are there because even though you may get a perfect score once, it may take you a couple of tries to get it again. THE best mind game ever!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Bought this  3 d movie for a  family member who is a Star Trek  fan and it looks good in 3d I personal yam not a Star Trek fan  if you a a fan it worth buying
B00000JMOF|4.0|My Son & I Both enjoyed this movie. He stated he liked it when it 'Spooked' him out & got scared.
B005LAII08|5.0|Good price  for the DVD  3d blu ray ,really nice to have in 3d  most of the time I order my movies from amazon  quick shipper  product as described
B003WUYRGI|2.0|It took ten minutes to find one word it should have a search. I think that there should be more on a page with an average of two. Other than that I'll still use it because in a real book there is a risk of a paper cut
B00EDPFJA4|4.0|I love the album.. it's the first from I've ever bought from Drake. The only thing I'm really disappointed is why is \\"Started from the Bottom\\" (the reason why I bought the cd) only a short radio edit (2:45 min) when the video version is nearly 5 minutes? The deluxe version is only 67 minutes in length. Surely the record company could have given us both versions.<br /><br />This is stupid, just like how on the last album the Motto was only available on the digital but not physical version yet was a MONSTER HIT.
B00821OUT6|2.0|This strangely fees like a ripoff of the walking dead in a different but similar scenario...no thanks. I think I need a little more substance and maybe less random people throughout the scenes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it don't need another game if u have this one an this is coming from a middle schooler
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it, easy to read and easy to use.  It is just like the reviews stated....in fact I think it is better!  You will love it I am sure!!!!!
B0036S4C6G|1.0|I didn't even make it through the third chapter. Reading about dump girls chasing guys and doing coke doesn't hold my interest. Had high expectations for this novel. The first chapter I liked, the second was ok, the third bored me so bad I moved on to a new novel. I hate to invest the time it takes to get half-way through a bad book, only to quit, so I saved myself early on this one.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very interesting account of an after life experience in laymen's terms. I  would recommend this for people who are interested in this subject.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Absolutely loved this game and hope to see more of this storyline. I looked for a new game for over an hour today when I finally came across this one. I wasn't disappointed. Great job. Keep them coming.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I hated boring history books in school. I would have had 100% on my tests if I had studied history in the manner that this book presents it! Excellent and captivating reading.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just started watching the series after hearing about from the ladies on my vanpool.  I watched all 3 seasons on Amazon Instant Video on my iPAD.  It was convenient.  I loved the story lines, the cinematography, the costumes of the era, and mostly the characters.  Bravo!
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Definitely a different twist on the fairy tale. Its like the Matrix mixed with an old time fairy tale and it had some really funny parts too. Great action movie. 5 stars
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Got bored really fast with this game. The visuals are great but it does not have enough to keep me hooked.
B0049VZ222|5.0|This show is GREAT! You will definitely be on your toes watching this show. A nail biter for sure. 5 stars..
B0063GORYU|3.0|This is a pretty basic spider solitaire with very annoying ads if you are connected to the internet. I am not sure how random the draws are and there is no score board to let you know how you are doing against yourself. I am looking for a better one but this will do for now.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I loved this movie! Definitely a movie to watch on movie night! The movie is action packed fun. 5 stars
0470913029|1.0|This book had a lot to say about nothing really.  Basically, just eat meat and veggies, some fruit and some nuts - that's it!  The whole book is based on a theory that we should eat like our Paleo &#34;cavemen&#34; ancestors and therefore feel and be &#34;healthy.&#34;  Nearly every page is filled with the author's references to evolution and his theory of eating like a caveman.  In my opinion, RIDICULOUS!  On the other hand, I did find the following two books more helpful: The Thyroid Diet, and Wheat Belly.  Good luck on your search for good health and what foods are best for your body.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Doyle's stories like those of Edgar Rice Burroughs were a part of my \\"fun\\" reading in those days<br />long ago, pre-TV when there were no computers, videogames or other mechanical gadgets.  The<br />printed word and your imagination could take you to places you would never see and let you be a<br />party to adventures that all youth dream of.  This collection has been a journey through time with<br />an old friend.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed reading all three books. The last one seemed to be propelled to wrap everything together and the story line was not like the other two. Still liked the theme.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I am from Canada and this product is not yet available here. I ordered from Amazon USA and the product was delivered on time.<br />I attached the Chromecast with my regular 37&#34; LED TV and it instantly became more feature enriched than a SMART TV. I casted netflix, youtube to my TV from my cell phone, laptop & tablet. Voila it was quick and crystal clear.<br />Even I casted movies from so many other web sites also, the only condition is always use CHROME web browser. Now, I am a die hard fan of Google Chromecast.<br />I will recommend this product to everyone. Instead of buying SMART TV, just attach this magical device to any regular TV (with HDMI connection) and your TV will out perform the expensive SMART TV. Sure, give it a try.
B000FCKPHG|4.0|I've read a lot of self-help type books over the years. Many were interesting, but didn't hit home the way Mindset has. Even before finishing it, I started thinking about my own sense of intelligence and talent in a different way. I'm better able to let go of that nagging sense of negativity and not being quite smart enough. It's also had a real impact on how I praise the students I work with.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book is that the numerous examples of growth and fixed mindsets can get repetitive. After reading the first few chapters, I started skimming until I got to the final chapter where she has more specific recommendations.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I had the LP, and listened to it daily for awhile.  It was time to go to CD, eventually iPod.  Great songs.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|title says<br />it all - no characters, no story, stupid zombie movie after first few minutes.  do not waste your time
B000P0J024|5.0|This set I listen to a lot. Great group of singers, fun to hear them together. Too bad there weren't more songs they did together.
0141439475|4.0|Mary Shelly's novel Frankenstein is enduring and interesting. It's a fast read and observes some very important concepts that have a great significance in society today. Most importantly, the novel observes the influence appearance has on society. Likewise, it shows the selfishness of human beings regardless of their form or stature. Overall, Frankenstein is a good read in order to understand some important aspects between the relationship of society and appearance.
B00CP4RZCU|5.0|Stand out tracks are the Road Back Home, Rust, Stillborn and the Blessed Hellride.  If you like Heavy Metal and some good Rock N Roll...you will like this.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Cute little animated movie.  Fun for the whole family.  Not what I had expected, but entertaning non the less. Fin.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I loved the plot line and character development. I'd recommend to any of my sci-fi friends and of course it's a classic.
B009JBZH54|5.0|i love it.i live in kenya and wasnt too sure it would get here due to our slightly flawed postal system.<br />the box set comes with five disks,three movie disks and two bonus feature disks.a great set for any fan
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I've been a fan of Mr. King for many years.  I feel in love with many of his novels: It, Bag of Bones, Christine, Cujo, and one of my all time top five novel picks, The Stand.  Of late, I've been slightly disappointed with his Novels and kind of got away from reading his books.  This summer, I received an Amazon gift card and purchased 11-22-63. From page one I was hooked. The storyline was really cool and I quickly identified with numerous characters.  Don't let the 800 plus pages scare you, it is worth it.  If you are a fan of his earlier novels, you will really enjoy it.  King is back.
B00DH4BL8Q|4.0|Percy is a young man who discovers he is a half blood son of a Greek god, Poseidon. He is shipped of to Camp Half blood to join others like him and goes on to enjoy (endure) adventures typical of Greek mythology.<br /><br />The stories are well written and fast paced, keeping your interest at all times. They are aimed at a younger audience so an easy read.<br /><br />I can highly recommend the complete series, it is a good buy and you can enjoy all of the books at your ownpace,
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is great game to play with my six year old he loves animal's and this game shows how rewarding it is treat animals nice . the game itself is fun for my six year old and myself. great free game, a lot of adds is the only shortcoming maybe too many?  but then again its a free game so?

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I think this is a really fun game. It is a little bit hard which I love I only wish there was no energy limit so I can keep playing lol & I wish it was easier to gain friends to send and get gifts to
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I saw the movie recently. My daughter had told me the book was excellent. I was so intrigued by the movie that I downloaded the book.<br />There are so many beautiful passages in the book. I'm glad I read it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|By far this is the best hidden objects game I've played. I hope they make more games like this. But they need to be a little cheaper seeing the game can be beat in an hour.
0812993845|3.0|Briefly: Lottie's boyfriend is about to propose, she just knows it. And, because she thinks too much (but not deeply), she is completely thrown off guard when he asks her...what they should do with his air miles. A trip somewhere, but not down the aisle. Hurt, Lottie breaks up with Richard. Once home, she remembers that a mysterious \\"Ben\\" had called her at work that week. Could it be? Is it possible that it's her old flame from that amazing summer in Greece?<br /><br />So Lottie calls Ben, and it is, indeed her Ben from the beach. Seems that they both have always looked back on that time as the best in their lives. So shouldn't they just throw caution to the wind and get married? There's only one request: that, since their previous relationship was quite sexually intense, this time around they will wait...until their wedding night.<br /><br />Didja Like It?: I really preferred Lottie's sister, Fliss, and her relationship with Ben's best friend, Lorcan (dontcha just want to eat up those names with clotted cream and marmalade?). Their problems and trials and issues they were facing were so much more real to me. Maybe that's how it was supposed to be? Lottie and Ben as the comic foils, Fliss and Lorcan as the focal points. My main gripe, however, was that the demands made by Fliss of the hotelier in Greece were more than a little unbelievable.<br /><br />Anything Else to Mention?: About ten years ago, I couldn't get enough of the writings of Ms. Kinsella and her set. Not that she's changed; I must have. I used to love the mistakes, floundering, bluster and occasional forehead-slappingness of this genre. It just doesn't hold the same level of appeal for me any more, I guess.<br /><br />To Read or Not To Read: If this is your cup of tea, then drink up. I must soften my critique a bit by saying that sometimes you just need to read a book that's well-written, yes, but that cleans all of the fantasy and paranormal and dystopian out of your brain. Something where you know that through all of the bickering, demi-hostility, misunderstandings and bad choices that the sparring couple will end up together in the end. And it will be right.<br /><br />Wedding Night by Sophie Kinsella was published April 23, 2013 by The Dial Press.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you struggled in book 4 keep going with 5. The twist and bends are worth it.  Everything connects and you learn more motivations.
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|I think this is a fun game if u want a challenge or realism in a situation of a emergency flight.Well worth the download.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Cannot believe this book is not  a bigger hit.  Best dystopian novel I've read in decades.  Like a combo of the best parts of \\"Lost\\" and Omega Man.
B00FF56IR4|1.0|Warning! Episode Turn Turn Turn gives away the ending to the Captain America Winter Soldier movie!<br />Seriously.<br />I'm Really Not kidding!<br /><br />That said:<br />The characters are very good, the acting is excellent. The effects (not overdone) show they clearly have a decent budget. A very good start to the series.<br /><br />Then the \\"Clairvoyant\\" story arch is added and the relentless downward spiral begins.<br />It is Extremely annoying, it increasingly intrudes on the action, and has the Stink of Deus Et Machina (bad plot work by an executive writer stepping on all the worker bee writers who actually have talent).<br /><br /><SPOILERS... My spoilers this time, not Thiers><br /><br />Important questions are raised and Not answered (\\"Sky is an O87? Let's sit on that for a few dozen episodes. I'm sure we'll still have jobs next season.\\")<br /><br />Finally the Last Straw \\"Turn Turn Turn\\".<br />Here are all your answers......Ta Daaa!<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />Shield is full of Maladroits and Dimwits???<br />(The only explanation for the \\"clever\\" plot twist<br />followed by a very, very, VERY predictable plot twist at the very end.)<br /><br />Imagine telling a deep, dark secret to a thousand or so shifty, unreliable people<br />.... and then keeping it for more than half a century!<br />Try it some day. See how well that works out for you!<br />Apparently, its not that hard!<br /><br />.... And that was the last episode of SHIELD that I will watch. And now I know the ending to the Captain America movie....<br />(I didn't see the Titanic movie because I knew the ship would sink in the end.... whatever.)
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I just got the app and was really looking forward to playing it because of all of the positive reviews but it gets stuck in the quick tips page and it won't finish loading. Please fix soon.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I enjoyed the first book, Beautiful creatures, BUT I loved this book. Much better pace and the authors seemed to have hit their stride.  I'm looking forward to the next book.  It's interesting and I like the fact they are writing this series from a teenage boys perspective.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I was fortunate enough to hear Adam Johnson, the author of The Orphan Master's Son, speak on the writing process of this novel as well as answer some of my questions as to how he went about researching some of the cultural aspects in the novel. After Adam answered my questions and I heard his reading, I was floored and had to buy the book afterward. I was even fortunate enough to have Mr. Johnson autograph my copy as well.<br /><br />The Orphan Master's Son may be set in a place that is alien to most of the reader's of this book. But despite making use of a unique and absolutely fitting locale of North Korea, the story that Adam tells is one that anyone who has ever gone through high school, a university, or a terrible job scenario can go through. Many people who have read this book (myself included) lived in places where people make it their quest to ruin things for us, where our bosses and teachers make completely absurd demands that seem impossible to fulfill, and the ever-looming threat of losing everything you knew and care about can occur with one wrong interaction with the wrong person. In North Korea, this reality persists in a way that is hundreds, if not thousands, of times more pervasive and violent then anything that most of us will ever witness in our lives. And yet, the story remains so familiar.<br /><br />I struggled for awhile to figure out why the story resonated with me, an American college student, so much until I read up to a section where Jun Do, the protagonist, is called \\"a survivalist with nothing to survive for\\". And that is when I understood what the moral was. Despite the modern world and all the pressures that come with trying survive in it, even in the most developed of places such as the United States and the most oppressive of places such as North Korea, the moral comes out that the human will to live never fades. Even when Jun Do appears to have nothing to live for, he continues to keep on living in a place and within circumstances that many people would simply give into and collapse under. This simple belief and struggle is what is at the heart of The Orphan Master's Son. And that is what makes it a story for generations of Americans to read for years to come.
B00ERD6XTI|5.0|read the book before watching any adaptations - you can measure the quality better that way.<br />I think I was born at the wrong time.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Couldn't put thus book down!<br />The love and drama was so consuming that ny daily household chores were pushed aside- (sorry hubby lol) I promise you won't regret reading this!
B008J5G1TW|3.0|First pair of keens i had were some newports,..now i dont know why but they seem to be lessening in the quality dept. i will say all my shoes{6dif pair} are keen and i am an AVID keen fan,but that said i think they need to step it up.....

B009RX7IX8|5.0|I don't buy very many television shows on DVD, but this one is a must-have.  It's a show that is smart and funny and at times, intense.  I started watching Castle for Nathan Fillion.  I stuck with Castle for the entire cast and crew and the fantastic writers.  It's not a difficult show to stick with.<br /><br />Castle isn't a procedural that takes itself too seriously.  It's more of a rodramedy (romantic-drama-comedy), with Season 5 the first season of our leads as a couple.<br /><br />I'm not going to tell you my favorite episode from this season because it would somehow diminish the rest.  And there aren't any episodes that deserve to be diminished.  Just buy it and enjoy it.<br /><br />Thank you, Andrew Marlowe, Terri Edda Miller, et al.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|I love this show.  The acting, writing, imagery are superb.  The acting especially.  I Can't wait for second season to start.
B00EDPFJA4|2.0|I expected more from this album....I enjoyed almost all of the last album, but I only enjoyed 3 songs out of this one. It sounded to me on a few of the songs you were rapping in the style of that garbage pathetic so called rapper Future or Rich Homie Quan/ one in the same to me. Drake, I think Lil Wayne once told you to be you...do your thing, you did that on your last two, but on this one you sucked and swallowed on a few. Sorry, but it's true. This is no better than Magna Carta..what the has happened to the rap game...We need a Comin Out Hard to shake this up a bit to get rid of the .....
B000VHPZVQ|5.0|November rain, Sweet Child O Mine, etc  are just incredible live.  Why is this like a school and we have to put so many words.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|It is intense full of intrigue,  you either like or hate the characters. Lots of action, fantasy, sex, and good description of the fictional lands
B0026P3G12|3.0|Her unvarnished singing gave me chills and goosebumps. The singing in this was flat by comparison. I would love to hear her just let go and soar with her voice again... get rid of the vocal coach.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I have always found Tina Fey to be a gifted comedian.  Her humor is delightfully sarcastic and intellectual.  Great read!
B005DZMODI|5.0|The item arrived in perfect condition and the packaging was very good. It is a pleasure to listen to this music. The musicians are indeed outstanding and I will strongly recommend this item.
031237674X|1.0|Wish Tucker would just state the facts instead of giving his ridiculous insights into what he thinks is going on with the consciousness or soul.  It's a frustrating read.  His flawed reasoning really gets in the way of the clear objective picture that the reader should be presented with.  Just let the amazing facts speak for themselves!  I miss Stevenson
B00BESM14U|5.0|I loved the book and i loved the movie. they both were amazing!!! I reccomend this to any teen ager!
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Insane parties,insane life. He rose above it all and became who he wanted to be. Great book, great read. I could not set it down.<br />I was in the middle of another book when I started this one. I begin reading it and the other one and Found myself only reading this one. I really couldn't stop reading it until it was finished. I would recommend this to any one who likes a story about real life, and climbing up and out of the crap to push forward and become successful in life.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Beautiful graphics! I have played this game on an S3 and an Optimus G.  There are two types of game modes. Zin for relaxing and action mode for folks who are in to competition.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I usually don't play games, but this one has me hooked! I love collecting bananas and getting new costumes. My kids enjoy it as well.
B00DJZ06DO|3.0|Know what you're buying.  The language is in Japanese, that much is made obvious by the info provided...and the fact that 3.33 isn't even available in English at all yet.  Additionally, the radical difference in price between this and the rest of the 3.33/3.0 discs available should give you a clue to the nature of the product.  This is a disc distributed by a Malaysian company.<br /><br />If those things scream certain phrases &#34;footpants,&#34; &#34;kneebelt,&#34; anything like that, then maybe this isn't the DVD for you.<br /><br />But: for Eva fans who would like to see part 3 as soon as possible, and add a physical entry to their collection as inexpensively as possible, this is a good product.  A collector's item this is not.  You'll pick up on that as soon as you physically hold the case in your hands and examine the boxart.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Esse aplicativo &eacute; perfeito para quem quer aprender novos idiomas ou refor&ccedil;ar o que j&aacute; sabe. Super din&acirc;mico, divertido e interessante! Faz com que voc&ecirc; aprenda brincando!
B00594XOZU|3.0|The app was great but then it started to get slow and I'm not able to get into my account and its driving me crazy :'(
B00BGD8CFK|4.0|I like this case. The rubber/TPU is stiffer than I like and the power button is kind of hard to push down. As usual, the volume buttons are easier to push. I like the bright colors and the protection.
B001BANK32|5.0|I read this book when it first came out, down in my basement bedroom all alone after dark, and I was afraid to open the door.<br /><br />I saw the movie when it came out and thought the book was better.<br /><br />This time the book is still scary and creepy. One's imagination is better than anything Hollywood can think up.<br /><br />Now I'm ready for the sequel.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|If you rent this movie, be sure and get the HD format. The standard format is horrible quality! The movie is complex and you must watch closely.. A very surprise ending.
1451695195|4.0|Dr. Alexander spins an entertaining, if uncompelling, tale of his voyage to the afterlife.  He was hospitalized and brain-dead for a week, during which time he was escorted through a religious awakening.  As a convincing proof of heaven, his story has a fatal flaw:  he seems to presume that the wonders he experienced took the entire week he was out.  I accept that he was brain-dead and unable to experience anything during most of this period, but all of us who dream know what complex and extended adventures can take place in a very short duration of sleep.  Everything he went through could have (and almost certainly did) take place in the minutes or hours that his brain took to come back on line.  Other readers may find Dr. Alexander's style a bit arrogant, but well, he is a surgeon, and it's a wonderful story!
B00594XOZU|4.0|I  love it but it glitches a lot. It won't let me log in on the fire. Otherwise it's good, it doesn't let you view others peoples videos though.
B00BI6SSMC|4.0|My son gave me this CD to listen to.  I had pretty much given up on Iron and Wine because I didn't care for some of his previous CDs.  However, I love Ghost on Ghost.  Most of the songs on this CD are as good as anything else Sam has done. Caught in the briars, Desert Babbler, Low light Buddy are excellent, classic songs.  If you are ready to give Iron and Wine another chance, this is the CD for you.  It brought me back.  By the way, I recently saw Iron and Wine in Minneapolis.  The band was so good.
B000RLHDUM|4.0|While I love Steve McQ, his version of this film is definitely dated ... probably the guy work $5M being &#34;super wealthy.&#34; This version is much better and timely. I really like the motivation much better than McQ's version. Good fun film.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|It's written like a Field of Dreams script~ if you think it, it will come~If only it really worked! O.k. enough to aide in the power of positive thinking. Can I get my $ back because the &#34;experiments&#34; failed?
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think everything costs way too many bananas but I love how many choices there are for minions and weapons.;)
B000FC0ZAI|1.0|Hated it. Had no purpose ny times gave good review but I disagree. Maybe if you are some kind of believer<br /> but I'm not
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is one of the best games I've ever played. I love to build on here. I highly recommend this game to anyone of any age. well I got to go build.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I wanted to access YouTube's Veritasium for its science videos which help to explain esoteric subjects such as Einstein's laws,of relativity  and such subjects as quantum mechanics, gravity, the Higgs Boson, and dark matter and energy. However, I found it was awkward to call up the ones I was looking for. I would recommend this to anyone interested in cosmology from students to those out of college for many years and never had the opportunity to study these subjects  that were not covered in physics classes. I particularly like the dynamic 3D diagrams.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is full of surprises, turns and unexpected twists. The huge cliffhangers at the end of almost every chapter get repetitive, but it is a great story and Katniss Everdeen is a great unlikely hero. Well worth a read.
B009MCRHH6|2.0|I couldn't make any headway with this game.  But I think with a good tutorial it would be challenging and fun.  Can't enjoy if you can't understand it.
0802473156|5.0|I am not much of a reader, but I fell in love with this book..very helpful if you're going through a bad relationship..
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|It needs more time. The reason why is that I do wrestling videos and the timer goes to 22:26ore time please
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I have read hundreds of self help books from the time I was 14 (almost 10 years now) and I have never written a review for any of them, this is one of my favorites, this is the kind of book I would give to a younger cousin or sibling now starting out. Its impact full. He teaches many of the same critical lessons taught by authors from the likes of  Echart Tolle to Ramit Sethi to Seth Godin  from one great perspective.  Four lessons that I took from this book were:<br />1) Start by Just Flossing One Tooth, just one tooth<br />2) Your opinion never matters, so dont waste your time forcing it on people because one conversation probably wont change a life time of belief<br />3) Love yourself<br />4) Google Oxytocin and get as much of it as possible.<br />5) Chose yourself, its selfish not to.
B0002UOK04|5.0|I got this album after getting Time. I was a bit apprehensive to get the band's older stuff since Time blew me away, but man I'm so glad I did. This band surprises me again with just how good it is, and I would say this one is just as good as Time, just in a different way. If you're like me and found Wintersun through their newest album, I would definitely recommend you get this one as well. It's got some downright beautiful melodies, but it's a lot heavier with more focus on guitar- no complaints from me.<br /><br />My favorites so far- Beyond the Dark Sun, Sleeping Stars, Death and the Healing, Starchild
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This game is fun. -  but it freezes in the middle of a game -and. I rarely get the packages I purchase.I tried to purchase more coins yesterday 62,000 coins for $49.95. My credit card has been charged,  but no coins!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it's also has cool levels like the moon or Mars or an alien planet you should really get it becase it is cool.
1446303314|5.0|Love this book. I have every Tilda book and this is one of the best. the work is so neat and tidy, do-able and the graphics are perfect. Instructions work for me - love to improvise on the ideas and make excellent gifts.
B0090SI4HO|5.0|The Last Stand is the best acting job by far I have seen in a long time. It couldn't have been written better. The characters were chosen perfectly. Some of it was sad, some was funny, some was serious. Arnold is excellent in his role as the Sheriff of Sommerton Junction. Arnold always wins. As of this date, I have seen this movie fifteen times.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Mind blown!!! What a great story. So many twist and turns!! A must read. Loved every minute of it! Wow
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Don't down load for the kindle fire it locks up at level twenty-six there goes the money I put in for the game even though the negative comments will never make it to the opinion polls review I will still try good luck to u all
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I should probably give it four stars because everyone once in a while the game crashes, but that's how awesome this game is.  Well worth the purchase price.  The graphics are outstanding, the physics engine is accurate and well built which makes for smooth game play and you can totally feel and see a difference between cars.  The difficulty is challenging but not so hard as to make you lose interest.  There is in game purchasing but they don't require it nor are they pushy about it.  In other words there aren't pop ups every time you load the game begging for money.  I appreciate that a lot.  The replay value is exceptional.  I can play for hours without getting bored.  I recommend this game for everyone.  Other game makers should take note of this games design characteristics and try to adhere to such good standards and practices.  I look forward to more games for my kindle fire HD by gameloft.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love that it's impossible to beat in an hour. Love the challenge. The graphics are great and I actually appreciate the music. Very calming. I love it so far.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|This movie was campy but great action scenes. Despite some low points, it kept both my husband and I engaged.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it ben a grate calculator for me throw my 12 grad and throw my life now so fare so good :-) :-) :-)
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Love ie !! A girl at work has one and love it. Fix really good. Was easy to put on and take off again.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I ordered this book for the kindle and wanted to lend it to others, wished that I had bought the actual book!  I tried the first exercise and was blown away at how it seemed to work.  Coincidence?  Not sure but very compelling!
B009D5VNLS|1.0|It was very boring!  Never got off the ground.  Could'nt understand dialogue.  Fake Irish, Scots or something.  Waste of money!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|It took way too long to get through the fluff to the point! Introductions should have been clearer. Just ok.
B00BXKOMT6|4.0|This is a compelling read.  I like the way Anthony develops his characters and am looking forward to Book 2.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Smart and plausible!.Brad is an excellent actor and it shows in this piece. I'll give it a 6.75. Not bad really.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Love the album the singers and all the songs.  They are my favorite group right now.  My friends love it to.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I don't watch very much TV but I am hooked. I just finished watching all the episodes up to season 4. I can't wait for season 5.
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|Not a typical Zombie movie, action suspense and better then I thought it would be.  Try it out very entertaining
B004TACMZ8|4.0|This works really well. Unfortunately, you cannot scan for everything at once, so you have to press a button, mark where the electrical is.  Then scan again, and mark where the studs are.  It should scan all at once.  But it gets the job done, it just takes too long to do it.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I did it backwards - I watched the series on Netflix and then read the book!  I had to find out what was real and what was embellished... and I was not disappointed!
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This was a gift for my wife. She loves it. It's a great twist on the Cinderella story. No worries about the kids watching it.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|What a plot twisting film,and the ending really shocked me,and the ending was really not what I expected! I loved Nikolaj Coster-Walthau in this;he rocked as a subtle psycho out to kill the protagonist.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|Kids like it and was really okay. It was easy to download and fun to play. Try it for yourself.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I loved it in the theater,and since it was a great movie with such uber awesome actors,and not a dull scene to be found in the entire film,I love it!!!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris was a true hero and candidly describes his experiences, both good and bad. It's a shame his life was snuffed out, he won't be forgotten. He was a true patriot.
B0054LJGWS|4.0|Great book about angels, demons, witches, and an eleven-year-old Antichrist playing make-believe with his best mates. It's a British comedy and the movie Goonies wrapped together with Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett's humor and imagination.  The story and characters are supernatural in a very human way.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|The story to this game is interesting. However it was a little difficult to figure out how to move through it at first.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I tried the sample first and was really hooked ..... and for 3/4 of the book I could hardly wait to get back to it.  The storyline is unique .... but it dragged on at the end and then I got sceptical.  The book should have been tied up and finished earlier: it started to become unbelievable.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|Good characters, well drawn plot.  Like a lot of modern stories, too many dry asides. When did we decide that was good writing?  Are we really that way in real life?  None the less, I loved the ending the the return to where it all started.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is great...Don't have to watch weather report on news , and everything I need to sleep/awaken is all here. Cant be without it...I.m not tech savvy but this is so very easy to use, even an oldie but a goodie can use it!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book provides an insight into the strength of character of a great genius _Tesla.  It also is an inspiration for anyone to achieve greatness through hard work,  a  persistent mind and the Will to achieve despite the odds.  I recommend this book to any person who may be doubting his or her ability. It's inspiring and provides much food for thought.  Also the Author makes it easy to read . I read this in less than a day and found it truly informative and inspiring!
B001AT4Y84|4.0|This is kind of a prophecy movie...using a 'female' machine just continuing the 'psyop' to make women more and more like men, but beyond that 'psychopaths' which is what robots will be.  Good movie, I recommend...
B00F5F140U|5.0|\\"Home Again\\" indeed!! A worthy successor to \\"Songs From the West Coast\\" & \\"The Captain & the Kid\\"...at long last more PIANO (Elton is so underrated as a pianist). But the real magic here is the gift of Bernie Taupin's lyrics. Just like Ira Gershwin always unjustly lived in the shadow of brother George, so few people know the fuel BEHIND Elton's music. Some of Bernie's best lyrics behind classic Elton's singing... I think his voice has actually gotten better through the years!  It's just like the old days... after a few listens, it grabs you and you can't stop playing it.. very rich, deep, soulful music... hooray!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Sub-way Surfers keeps my childeren occupied. THANK You!! My childeren are like little worms but they will listen to when I tell them that I will take away Sub-way Surfers.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I READ FOR MANY REASONS BUT ALWAYS TO FEEL ELEVATED BY THE WORDS I READ.  THIS MADE ME FEEL SAD, DEPRESSED,AND AT TIMES PHYSICALLY ILL.  I DID NOT ENJOY THIS DARK, CRUEL BOOK AND WOULD  NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.
1781162646|2.0|Spoilers<br /><br />Stephen King is a master story teller and he wrote THIS?  It was phoned-in and not gripping.  No one cares about the tacked-on romance with the single mom, no one cares about Wendy, no once cares about your fun times in the dog suit.  We wanted more of the psychic Rozzie and less of the cute couple Tom and Erin.  They were stock characters through and through.  In fact, could we at least SEE the ghost in the House of Horror?  Nope, just a headband.  And then the killer is finally revealed and it's a big yawn.  But sharp-shooting Annie Oakley saves the day.  Gimme a break, man.  I KNOW King can write better than this, he is the MASTER of suspense and yet this book has none.  Sad.<br /><br />I liked the carny talk and learning about amusement parks- that should have been expanded a LOT and we would have a good book. Instead we have a boring \\"mystery\\" and some cardboard gee-whiz kids.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I delayed reading the sequel because they are rarely as good as the fist.  This was a pleasant surprise and I'm anxious to read the third one!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|It's nice to know how much charge I've got left depending on what I'm doing - reading, surfing, playing games - shows as much or as little information as you want - you can just look at the pic of the battery or see a graph on how often you charge and how long it takes. Especially helpful knowing how long you will need to leave it plugged in to fully charge
B009KS4XRO|5.0|wish bingo blitz would not have a limit on gifted credits, keys, and powerups. Have to wait hours, then lose them if it rolls into next day. love the shadow cards, wish they came more frequently.
B0071NOU78|5.0|First off. You have to buy 2 of different color. Me and my 10 year old son went at it with these pretty hard. This is a durable product meant to be played with. Great.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I think its a very cool game... U can ride in a different buggy r vehicle after collecting coins and upgrade yr ride. Unlock different stuff, its fun as hell.
B0015AARJI|5.0|My grandson requested this for his birthday.  He was happy to get it and is enjoying using it.<br />It arrived on time and in good condition.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Let's face it, I love iron man, and I look up to RDJ as inspiration.  Great movie all around. Twisted the overall mandarin story a lot, but I'm ok with it based on how this movie told the story.<br />I recommend this, and Iron Man fans wont b disappointed.
1881273873|5.0|I ordered my book on a Monday and got it in the mail on a Saturday!!!! The book is in very good condition. I was skeptical of buying a used book but surprisingly the book doesn't even look used!!!!! I will definitely buy from this seller again!!!! Good quality product, good price, and ships quickly!!!! I haven't read the book yet but I'm really looking forward to it!!!!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love this game so much the graphics and game play r so much better than 3 and it has a storyline on top of it I can't wait to play more.
B00005MM67|2.0|The storyline is blah,  the visual is blah<br />not a great buy.  Better off spending your money<br />on a different movie, unless you are very very<br />interested in mountain climbing.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Well I like the game it's just them prices are to high and you barely get any of them keys but I think it's better then tremble run and it should automatically go to the next place cause I don't no how so I just started over and now I'm in wat Eva that place is called so,it should ask you a million times if you wanna go to the next place if yes it should change automatically and you should be able to say don't ask me again
B006LSZECO|3.0|Took me awhile to get into this novel...book was ok..think younger people would like better ..I was disappointed .<br />People my age felt the same way as I did..
B00DPUB59W|3.0|Neil Jordan (\\"The Crying Game\\") directs a UK-Irish fantasy thriller \\"Byzantium\\" starring Gemma Arterton and Saoirse Ronan as Clara and Eleanor Webb, two mysterious women staying at a run-down seaside hotel \\"Byzantium.\\" They have secrets that no one should know. Their long-term relationship is severely tested when Eleanor is attracted to a lonely boy Frank (Caleb Landry Jones). Also, some secret organization seems trying to locate the girls.<br /><br />You may think this is yet another vampire-themed fantasy movie. In fact, \\"Byzantium\\" seems not really interested in the romantic side of vampirism; the film explores what it is to survive while being ostracized (and ostracized in more than one way). The film's allegorical attempts to view the two lonely women are fine, but they are weakened by the heavy-handed narrative and supporting characters that are too many and not interesting.<br /><br />Neil Jordan, having directed \\"Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles\\" back in 1994, is no stranger to the overcrowded genre where \\"a new take\\" seems no longer new. With atmospheric photography, \\"Byzantium\\" has a near-epic-scale back story that should be as intriguing as those of characters played by Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst in \\"Interview,\\" but in \\"Byzantium\\" two women's story, told in too many flashbacks that look more like a series of vignettes, only frustrates, not tantalizes, the viewers.
0553386794|1.0|I am one of those people who like to be entertained. Usually a book full of gore, sex and perversion has at least one likeable character. I quit reading when they killed the wolf pup. He was the best character in the whole book.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|I started and stopped this book twice before deciding I needed to finish it because it kept sticking with me. The characters are so memorable for their humanity. It was wonderful to see the the protagonists finally achieve the freedom to give themselves to each other.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Larsson was a great author.  You  want to keep reading to see what will happen next.  I didn't read the book in sequence, but didn't matter that much.  All three were excellent
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I'm giving the Google Chromecast two stars because it really is a good device that works exactly as advertised but it doesn't support enough streaming media apps to really be useful.  Buyers should understand that if all they want is to stream YouTube or Netflix from their iPad to their TV, this thing is great.  It's inexpensive, easy to set up and it works just fine.  The problem is, that's all it does.  It streams media from YouTube, Netflix, and music and video from Google Play.  You can also pop up web pages from your PC, but not from your Android or iOS device.  What you can't do is stream video through Chrome, which seems odd.<br /><br />Something really promising about this device is that it lets you use your smart phone or tablet as your remote.  That's an amazing feature and it works really well; almost flawlessly.  Some of the negative reviews complained about that, but it's a really cool feature and other devices could take a page from Google's book on this kind of integration.  If this thing supported just one more app, I'd be tempted to give it 4 or even 5 stars, but with it's current limitations I just can't do it.<br /><br />Google promises that more apps are coming, but which ones?  If this device supported the TWC app or HBOGo, I might have kept it. If it could stream music or video from Windows Media Player, I might have kept it.  The bottom line is, what I really want is a Roku box and what I should have done was shelled out the extra coin to get what I was looking for rather than hoping for a less expensive solution.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, one day this little gizmo is going to give Roku a run for their money.  Unfortunately, that day is not today so I'm sending mine back and I'll invest my pennies in a more full featured device.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Edge of your seat ride!  Already started the next book within minutes of finishing this one! I am hooked on this series!
B008JFUO72|4.0|I expect Tony Stark to be a smart mouthed and brilliant scientist and an entrepreneur surrounded by an invincible armor of his Iron Man creation. In this film Stark is a broken man that has lost his way in life and doesn't really know what his future holds and he is on the verge of a metal breakdown. Only when the things he values most in his life are threatened with destruction does he really react the way Tony Stark would behave but without his technological weapons and advantages, how will he survive and win...<br /><br />This movie to me is a dramatic change from the traditional Iron Man theme and I don't like it as well as the other films in the series. The action is good but no one likes seeing their idol crushed and taken down the way the role of Tony Stark (Iron Man) is played in this film. For me this film was a 3.5 to a 4 star rating. It had so much more potential than that. In addition it leaves you hanging at the end with a plot that can go either way.<br /><br />This film at times was dark and more depressing because of Tony's depression and panic attacks. For me I look forward to the old Tony Stark and the Iron Man who crushes the bad guys. Call me old fashion call me crazy but my superhero had better kick some bad guys around with attitude. This film was at best a four star rating and that is a little kind.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Well. It's a fun game. Most things are open to you. But the quests shouldn't have to require Facebook connection. That's all I have to say.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie and we will watch it again. I thought that Brad Pitt did a good job in acting the role of an UN investigator. The action is nonstop and interesting. It is a different spin on the zombie movies as these devils are lightning fast and strong. The scenes in the movie can be graphic but it is a zombie movie and you knew that going in.<br /><br />I am reading the book and the DVD came so we went ahead and watched it. I was surprised at how different the book and film are but I enjoyed the film for what it was, an action movie based on a horror topic. There were some parts of the movie that were just stupid in how people behaved in a crisis but it is probably closer to real life behavior than we would like to admit. People will panic and act dumb!<br /><br />It is a good film but it certainly is not the most graphic or scary movie about zombies that I have seen. For me the film Night of the Living Dead was a shocker that I still remember to this day. I also think that the TV show Walking Dead is far more gory and graphic in the traditional sense of the zombie stories. For those reasons I rate this film as a 4 star entertainment value.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is just hard enough to make you want to keep working at it. I play at least once a day!
1594202273|4.0|I attended a presentation by Mr. Schlosser last night. His point about the inevitability of an unintended yield is well-taken. I was also an AF Nuclear Weapons Specialist for 24 years. Haven't finished the book yet but am making an assumption that Mr. Schlosser makes the same omission as he did last night.<br /><br />Thousands of enlisted technicians maintain our nuclear arsenal. Day in and day out they follow the most excruciatingly high safety standards. Yes, some make mistakes and some are careless and we carefully watched and corrected those who violated safety rules. Nuke techs are at the mercy of an enormous bureaucracy which changes policy at the drop of a hat. Changes to safety or procedural steps are made without notice leaving techs to find out only during a major inspection. All language is subject to interpretation and a great deal depends on whom is interpreting what. Much time is spent interpreting what a technical order is saying, higher headquarters interpretation is sought and then an inspection teams comes in and redefines the language.<br /><br />Inspection teams are full of inspectors who never worked on a nuclear weapon. After the loss of accountability of the 6 warheads from Minot to Barksdale, the AF Nuclear Weapons Center was expanded into a monolith. Global Strike Command was stood up. Inspection teams from the AF Safety Center, the Defense Nuclear Weapons Agency, GSC and the offices within the AF Nuclear Weapons Center took on the status of Gods. So many inspectors who have never worked on a weapon descend on a unit and decide what their interpretations of the technical data are. Of course, the technician pays the price. Pitched battles between so-called Subject Matter Experts, inspectors, retired officers, engineers, and scientists go on and on with no resolution. Technical data may or may not change. In the meantime the technician struggles with keeping weapons safe, secure, and reliable always wondering when a standard procedure today will become a major inspection failure tomorrow.<br /><br />It's these enlisted personnel who deserve the thanks of our nation.  They work in operating facilities from the 70's which have been refurbished multiple times. Even updates to facilities affect the weapons and if proper procedures aren't followed it's the technicians and the units who get the blame. They work with equipment that is aging and failing. They put themselves behind double fences with razor wire, armed guards, senors, and sometimes even remotely operated guns to kill any threat. They work in buildings with no windows where just opening a maintenance bay can get one stood up at gun point. These technicians who have TS clearances and who fall under the Personnel Reliability Program which means their behaviors are monitored are considered the \\"insider threat\\" and know they are viewed suspiciously by those who carry the guns, AF Security Forces teams.<br /><br />Thanks to all 463X0s and 2W2X1s who maintain our nuclear arsenal.
1938469011|5.0|I really enjoy this book. I am an avid home brewer and grow several varieties of hops in my back yard so I am always interested in learning more about hops. This book provides a wonderful amount of history and knowledge of hops as well as information on growing that will surely benefit my own hop gardening. Excellent addition to my home brew library.
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|Great album as allways.Thier music gets moor complex every album.This album is truly great.They are awesome in concert,its truly amazing.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I purchased this for our family to complete the series we already have.  We love watching them over and over.
1451695195|5.0|The book was an excellent read giving insight into life after death.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is questioning their faith in God and His promise of eternal life.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter who already has the first three movies.  She loves them and watches them over and over.
B00B1D7ANK|4.0|We have a lot of Schleich toys at our house because they are fun, realistic, and durable. The quality of workmanship on the pieces is usually exceptional. When I saw this toy, I knew that I wanted to get it for my 14-year-old daughter as she loves the medieval time period. This is what she had to say about it...<br /><br />First and foremost: my first impression of this creation was \\"Awesome!\\" But as I looked closer and started to play with the toy more, I noticed a few issues:<br /><br />1. The coloration of the dragon's body, scales, and wings bothers me because the colors are not deep or rich enough. The shadows do not look accurate on the horns, body, wings, and feet. Overall, the colors make it look more cheap, unrealistic, and plastic than typical Schleich toys.<br /><br />2. While I love the idea of movable wings, they wings pop off the dragon too easily, making it a pain for kids to play with.<br /><br />3. The hands of the knight are not typical Schleich quality as the metallic paint is worn off revealing black. And this is with no use whatsoever other than a single touch.<br /><br />Now that the criticisms are done, I will say that the armor on both the dragon and the knight are phenomenal. The painters seem to have mastered the art of painting metal. I especially adore the battle axe attached to the dragon's tail. I find the moving wings to be intriguing and rather fun. The magnet that holds the rider to the saddle is ingenious. Plus, the rider can stand up when not on his steed! Also, I enjoy looking the dragon's facial expression since it is quite amusing with its tongue sticking out and its one pupil wandering off to the side instead of to the front as the other does.<br /><br />In the end, I give the Dragon Rider Schleich figure 4 ½ stars in creativity, but only 3 stars in execution. In its entirety, I would say that this product is not in touch with the finer quality of its kin in the vast collection of Schleich merchandise.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Purchased for my daughter who is nine years old.  She loves watching it as do we.  My wife is a teacher and her students love it as well.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|The whole point of the iron man movies is that Tony Stark is Iron Man no matter if he is in the suit or not. The suit is just an extension of who he is, a hero. I loved all three of these movies and thought that this was a great ending to the series. Well worth my time in watching it. I was not disappointed. Unlike another super hero trilogy that just ended, which the third movie in that series was crap, this one was really, really good. Bring on Avengers 2<br /><br />P.S. I do miss the ACDC though. Need the rock and roll.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A story filled with sadness yet it was warm, funny and happy too! I have to say at the end of the story (which I didn't want to end) I learned about true forgiveness and releasing yourself from the pain attached to not forgiving. Excellent book! I'm a brand new fan.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I couldn't stop watching!  I went through all three seasons in two weeks.  Good thing Season 4 isn't available yet or I wouldn't get any work done at all!
B00FEHXISA|2.0|Let me preface this review by stating that: I love movies! I'm a movie junky and not just because I watch a lot of them, it's because I have college education revolving around them.<br /><br />This movie is a steaming pile.<br /><br />The writing is terrible. So many loose plot points and character development.<br />This is almost not worth 2 stars. I can't get past how bad this movie is. It's as if they spent 200million in special effects and put it on a script that was only 10 pages long.<br /><br />Friggn terrible.<br /><br />That is all.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The app is great so great that I would tell friend ti get but loads slowly. But I love it. :)
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I really like this movie, good story line and action. The blue-ray dvd looks good and the price was right.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Good thriller. kept the mystery alive but the last few chapters seemed too rushed.  I did love the creepy family twist.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app is worth the $3.91 to get the pro version.  Works really good on my Kindle Fire HD.  If you have a Kindle Fire give this app a try.

B001BR5NN0|5.0|The movie is great but what I was looking for was a good quality DVD that had lots of extras and this bluray version delivered! Great quality video and love the extras!
B000MD9UJC|4.0|The directions are a little vague, but I managed to figure them out. Very bright output and a great way to convert your mini Maglite w/o it costing an arm and a leg for a new one.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I have so many thoughts about this book.  I watched the movie first and then couldn't not read it.  I swear, this book gets into your head and it simply will not turn loose.  I tried to put it down several times as it just left me feeling drained emotionally... tainted in a way, even, which is hard to explain, but the best way I know to convey my feelings.  I couldn't.  I want to hate Eva.  I want to feel sorry for Eva, but mostly I don't want to feel anything like Eva.  And I do.  She has thoughts that cut you to the core.  That really make you think about what it means to be you.  About what it means to leave behind a piece of yourself in this world.  What it means to be trapped in a role you never auditioned to play.  In the end, when I finished I felt relieved, but I still can't stop thinking about it.  When an author is that good-- when she can get inside your head like that-- well that takes true talent.  It's a bit pretentious.  I think it needs to be.  Ultimately, I didn't want to relate to Eva.  I didn't want to relate to Kevin.  I didn't want to relate to Franklin.  And sadly, there's a piece of each them in all of us.  It's a sobering mirror to look upon.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Loved it as a kid and still love it now as an adult. Now my kids enjoy it too! Great movie!
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|I never saw World War Z at the movies nor have I read the book. I can say I have enjoyed the uncut version I brought here on amazon instant video also I love the fact I did not have to drive to Wal-Mart to get it. Buying it here makes it very convenient. Plus the movie had great action packed moments, a great plot and awesome graphics. I have seen a lot of Zombie movies in the past ,and this one of the best ones I have seen. I hope they make a second one.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|Did not like previews of movie so did not order and not sure why I was charged for this movie.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Paid version is full of annoying ads, and pop-ups. So much for ad free. Do not pay for app if you are expecting game to be ad free.

B006INDGFE|5.0|hilarious!!! Loved the movie! I can't wait to see the third one! Love the cast and the plot! At times not that believable but that's why we call it movies right!
B009FXIICK|5.0|I got this game the last time it was FAOTD. It's in my top three games. I play it all the time. The graphics are adorable and the objectives are more interesting than most match 3 games. Yes, the time does speed up. But it would be really boring if it didn't. I've made it past level 60, at which point it gets too fast for me. But it took me about 45 minutes to get that far. I think that's a pretty successful game if it can keep me playing for 45 minutes.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I just love it.  It takes you into their lives and makes you believe Sherlock is alive and well today.

B004LWZW7Y|5.0|This is for my daughter and son in law as they watch a lot of DVD's and requested this on their Christmas list.

B00AQ71FLK|5.0|One of the most additive RPG games that I've played sense FFV  . With every upgrade their comes better gift n better hero's. No complaints other then the small glitch wit my hero's skill not acting right but other then that  its a great over all game. A must have if u luv online play.

0307951154|5.0|I've gotten hooked on Jo Nesbo, and just didn't want to miss one of his books. I'm a little bit OCD, so getting all of the books in the series, I'm able to have them available to read them in order. Unfortunately, the translated (American English) versions sometimes follow by several years the original Norwegian versions, so it's just easier for me to have them all stacked up and ready to be devoured!
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|First the length of the movie was hard to take, it took me two nights to complete but it was well worth it. this film is beautiful. I would love to have my book be made into a movie by Peter Jackson. LOL
1400031354|5.0|Purchased this book for my grandson, as part of his &#34;summer&#34; reading list requirements. I'd already read it years before, but couldn't find my copy, so had to send a few bucks to get another copy. I just didn't want him to miss out on such a delightful story, and the wonderful style of Alexander McCall Smith. Got a great price as well! Look forward to seeking out this vendor for future book purchases.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Listen, this series is in a word; awesome. the reason for the 4 star rating and not the full 5 is the third movie Alien 3, it simply is the weakest link in a great group of movies.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I used this for streaming YouTube videos from my iPad and Netflix from my laptop. Works really well. Can't wait to see more applications come out!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I know this was written by Amazon but it is really not a self plugging piece of work, it is helpful and a great guide. I recommend you read it if you want to publish, I did and now my book is selling on Kindle, How Cool is that?
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|L LOVE THIS GAME!!!! !!:):):)when I get home from school l always see if someone has drawn me back .it is a lot of fun even if you are a bad at drawing.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This was a very exciting movie.  Well written and suspenseful.  Not many of movies today do I have an desire to see but this was an exception.  I generally like movies from Great Britain since they are usually so well written and acted and have interesting plots.  This one fit that category.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I love the way Stuart Woods writes.  He is so witty and I giggle throughout his books.  The relationship between Henry and Walt is special.  I will be reading all of Walt Longmire's books because the show is on hiatis and I miss watching it.  With the characters on TV, I have a picture of the people in the book.  Although, they have toned down Vic a lot for the TV show.

The boy chosen is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hucherson) who Katniss has met before. Katniss is allowed to quickly say goodbye to her mother (Paula Malcomson) and  Primrose. Her sister gives her back the mockingjay pin now for her protection. Katniss also says goodbye to Gale (Liam Hemsworth), an older teenage boy whom she likes. He tells her to use her bow. She can hunt.   The journey begins on a high speed rail train traveling at 200 mph to the Capitol.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I read my first two books in the series in paperback. I enjoyed my third book on my KIndle. This book is okay..I do like the follow up on the characters. I will look forward to the follow up. I hope it knocks our socks off, since we have to wait for more.
B00BXDOSXS|3.0|I just installed this, so really haven't had a chance to review the app. I'll revisit my review once I've had an opportunity to use and try the application. On first look, it seems to have the basic functionality required, but I'll need to take a closer look at it.

B00D48BT5A|5.0|As a long-standing Bryson fan, I eagerly await his new works. 'One Summer' does not disappoint. In his usual brisk and punchy style, full of wonderful research, Bill has woven the strands of history culminating in the summer of America 1927, together.<br /><br />'One Summer' fits in his series of historical works, with small amounts of his dry humour creeping in. Its not one of his laugh-out-loud travel books, nor is it trying to be.<br /><br />His description of the lead-up to the Great Depression is a chilling reminder of the market manipulations foisted on an unsuspecting public.<br /><br />Absolute brilliance, entertaining and informative. Like all of Bryson's books, will submit to many re-readings, with each one gathering a more nuanced insight. If only the school's of the world had teachers like Bill, educational standards would fly...
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Thought the movie held to the original and still delivered modern movie magic. If it seemed a little far-fetched to you then don't go to see sci-fi movies about traveling through space.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is one of the best solitude games I've played.  On the downside it is rather addictive and if you've not careful you'll be up late trying to beat the course you've on.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|First off, I love playing this game. I like building games and thought the idea of building a JURASSIC PARK would be excellent. That is until you want to purchase a cool dinosaur. Or a unique building. Paying UPWARDS of $10.00 for ANYTHING in a game is robbery! As much as I love playing I refuse to spend more than I would for a fast food meal for my grandson. And SHAME ON YOU LUDIA,for getting children hooked on playing the game, knowing they will want to buy the &quot; COOL&quot; dinos and other stuff and how much those items cost. RIDICULOUS! Another thing that irks me is when you are asked if you want to visit a neighboring park. This is the Ludias display park. The park you could build if you had unlimited funds. The park you visit is HUGE and must have cost over five hundred dollars easily. Who could build that? Not a kid. If I had unlimited funds I could build a dream park too. So LUDIA, give us a break... lower your in game prices. Must you REALLY be that greedy?
B0098QBEXO|5.0|Like many other reviewers I stumbled across this movie without a clear idea of what it was about. My gosh was it so emotional and heartwrenching! However I will say this, if you have recently lost a loved one it may be a bit too much of an emotional toll if you are still grieving, but for the rest of us I believe it is a reminder to live life to the fullest and that time is very short. Lovely film.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Literally didn't put it down until it was finished.<br /><br />Excellent<br /><br />Would make a great weekend read at some cabin in the mountains.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Set up wasn't as easy as I thought.  I had to disable the AP on the Netgear router to make it work.  Wish there are more Apps that can cast onto my TV....  Overall, it works great for the price!
B00F91G5BS|3.0|As Zombie flix go this is just OK considering the budget and source material of the book.<br />Maybe they should have gotten some help from the Walking Dead Screen writers.<br />This movie failed to draw me in with lack of plausibility yet the book accomplished just that.<br />World War Z the book greatest accomplishment was making Zombies plausible through believable story line.<br /><br />Gerry Lane as a Character in the movie was just thrown out there.<br />They could have done something creative within an extra 10 or 12 minutes from the start of the movie.<br />I know character development is not something Hollywood movies do much anymore but an attempt would have helped.<br /><br />Glad I just rented.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Nice design and lots of options. I really like the ability to easily dim the clock. Also, there are a lot of waking sounds to choose from.
B0061S073A|4.0|This app is great for my 8 year old son. He was constantly getting on youtube and watching things that I did not approve of. I like that I can pick the apps he can view and lock the time limit as well. Perfect for his age! It does not work for my 15 year old, where I want a little more monitoring included, but is great for younger ages.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Great movie with a lot of themes and great special effects. If you like movies that are thought provoking with imagery, then you will sure love this.
B009FXIICK|2.0|This match 3 game is OK, but there is simply nothing that sets it apart from the other match 3 games out there, except for a timer that becomes oppressively fast just 6 or 7 levels in. Ultimately this will end up being deleted.

B00EP0KBXM|5.0|This movie took my breath away. This is a story about a young boy struggles<br />to overcome his fears to become a man. The acting was excellent and never<br />once did I feel that the actors were just \\"acting\\". The story-line was intriguing<br />to say the least. It's sci-fy twist; returning to Earth after 1000 years<br />only to find that its hostile to humans, kept me wondering if such a<br />possibility could come to pass. And \\"yes\\" it is possible. A great entertaining<br />movie. I will buying the DVD.

B00005YUNY|5.0|Gave this as a gift (from an Amazon gift list). The recipient said he put the dvd on the list a few years ago but always had something else to get instead and no one got it for him. He and my brother sat down together the very evening it was received and they watched it and declared it worthy.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Many reviews talked about this book as one where nothing much happened. Sorry, don't agree. Won't say more than that as I don't want to spoil it for others. Needless to say, it developed more of the characters & sadly, did away with others I had grown attached to.  Mr Martin, please hurry up with the next book!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Absolutely well written! A battle college to train children for soldiers for the upcoming conflict with the Buggers who nearly wiped out the human family as a whole. Earth bands together and sacrifices their most excellent children to be trained to become the next needed Julius Caesar, Nepoleon or Bismark. All hope is pinned upon these children, and along with hope great pressure is put on these young ones who are, in fact, the saviors of the human race.<br />Upon Ender, an eight year old child, is the most promising candidate, the term &#34;promising&#34; is not just an unfair description that proves to be the ultimate weight, but the killing pressure that causes Ender to decided to go for all or nothing. It is us or them and no mercy was to be shown to this species that had struck first.<br />This decision, this strategy, will cost Ender dearly. What will his own soldiers think of an officer that thinks in this fashion? With complete Xenocide.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Well written with good character development. I knew very little about the orphan trains even though my mother in law had one of the children living with her family throughout her childhood. He was a very troubled youth as many of them were, and now I know why. Growing up in the 50's and 60's in Minnesota, I do not recall hearing about all these children. I read this book in two evenings as it really held my attention.
B00DJ80VLS|2.0|I think this release is not much better than ADToE,which I thought was weak.Ater 2 years I still can't get into it,and I've tried several times.It just doesn't click.This one doesn't either.This cd continue's the same tired formula's,the rehashed riff's and pattern's,the syrupy/ballad type choruses,and Rudess' continually self indulgent overkill on most of the song's while Myung continues to be thrust into the background.Five stars??REALLY??!NO WAY!!I've been a fan of this band since it's inception and they are about one more cd away from having a fork stuck in them.This band died when Portnoy left.O.K., let me have it Portnoy hater's.Whether it's his ego,backing vocals or personality you hate about him,Portnoy was the MAN behind the kit.I like and respect Mangini,but in the DT setting he doesn't come close.His playing on this and the last cd is pretty reserved and mechanical,nothing ground breaking.This cd he was supposed to get his chance to open it up and he falls short.Nothing in his playing on this album that hasn't been done by a hundred drummers already,while not bad,is really nothing special.Portnoy was a master of spontaneity,always had something that would make you rewind and say,'what was that'?I KNOW a lot of fan's agree with me.Don't get me wrong,Mangini has his moments on here but they aren't that original.I'm a drummer of 30+ years so I pay a great deal of attention to it.As for Rudess,he continues to ruin this band.The huge 3 or 4 minute airy part in the middle of Illumination completely ruins the flow of the song,then it jumps into a stacatto riff after that,a bit disjointed.I could say the same for Enigma,a lot of pyro technics but again,a bit disjointed.They USED to write epic tune's and instrumentals that flowed much better than these last 2 releases.IMO,the last good release was TOT.Killer from start to finish.Subsequent releases had a few good songs,but a lot of filler.That doesn't cut it anymore.If they are serious about sticking aroung for much longer they need a hiatus,fire Rudess(but will never happen)Get Moore or Sherinian,and let Myung BREATHE,and write a REAL DT masterpiece.This album isn't it.Whoever wants to criticize me,oh well,I have an opinion just like you,accept it.And I've listened to this cd about 20 times now.If it's not doing it yet for me it probably won't.I would rather listen to Portnoy Sheehan,Macalpine and Sherinian than this,pretty sad.To want to listen to someone else play DT songs than listen to DT,REAL sad.On another note,CAN'T WAIT for the new FATE'S,I bet the bank it blows this release out of the water.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|What a soulful look into rock and roll history and the humble beginnings of great artists. I LOVE Dave Grohl!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I am really bad at waking up in the morning so I decided to download this app. It works great. It plays my music and has a cool feature that keeps you device safe to plug in over night without it getting hot. Get this app.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is extremely reliable and fast. The big screen helps those who may have sight problems as well. I would recommend.
B008ADSDHQ|5.0|I loved Steig Larrson mystery novels, and now Jo Nesbo, is my new thriller mysteries author. He has the same writing style as Steig Larrson.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game. love it. all it needs are boats and stuff for the river. but in all it is a AWSOME GAME!!!!
B00E8AVNBI|1.0|Where to begin? This is a sweaty ball-sack of a movie that plays like the low budget CGI video sequences from a 1990's video game. Imagine a movie populated by a stable of aging male porn stars in all of their athletic sock wearing glory, and you'll have some idea of how bad this film really is. There are a lot of gun shootout sequences with members of the cast constantly diving for cover, but I think it was their desire to minimize their on-screen time that has so many of the cast hiding behind available furniture. Mickey Rourk looks like a refuge from a gay porno flick, and I kept expecting him to torture other cast members in some ill conceived anal rape sequence.  My advice would be to spend the time you would wast on this film picking your feet and smelling toe cheese.
B008VBYN80|4.0|A very fun game to play. Exciting detail. not a thing yet observed that I would change. I enjoy it
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Awesome trance music.  She is one of the few people I have heard that can keep the violin from sounding like a dying cat.

B00DHRLK84|2.0|I originally ordered this from Amazon for a &#34;movie night.&#34;  However, because it was misdirected and arrived two days late (Amazon's fault), I sent it back.  I rented it instead for movie night.  It really was not much better than a &#34;made-for-TV&#34; movie.  My husband said, &#34;You didn't tell me this was a Zombie movie.&#34;  He kept looking at me throughout movie, with the expression &#34;Really??  You rented this???&#34;
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Like other Diana Krall albums, I can listen to this all night.  The album is diverse and is not just for Jazz lovers.

B003U4ZQRK|4.0|This is the season where things finally began coming together, and it may actually have helped that I got into it only once the show's run had finished and it was off the air - could watch the whole thing sequentially, no waiting!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game all I have to say is GET IT NOW!!!!!!! Seriously  it's awesome. It is not a waste of time at all
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I walked into this expecting a half hearted attempt at continuing the saga of Danny.  I was fantastically surprised at the depth and detail in this \\"sequel\\" to The Shining.  I find it very interesting to decipher the events of Mr. Kings life through the changes in his writing over the decades.  An excellent read.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|If you are a fan you  will absolutely love this cd!!! I am a fan and can't get enough of it. It is good that they are all back together again
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Great movie, with great acting.<br />  Overall it was a unique movie in a sea of book turned movies that have been coming out lately. It's funny and incredibly suspenseful, and strangely beautiful. The movie starts off as a bank robbery, and that is all the trailer leaves you with. It's far more than that, and far deeper. If you have nothing to watch, this is definitely a movie worth watching!!
0307744434|3.0|So I'd been hearing about this book for awhile and finally bought it. It's a captivating story and the author has an engaging and elegant style. But the structure of this book, the jumping back and forth between different times and everything being told out of chronological order makes it very confusing and difficult to understand what's going on. I've finished it and I'm still not sure at what point certain events happened in the overall timeline. I mean I certainly get the metaphor of that, clocks and time are a major theme in the novel, in particular the beautiful clock that is the centerpiece of the circus. But while the clock and the circus are beautiful, underneath everything at the circus is out of joint. So I get that Morganstern was trying to reflect that in the structure of the novel. It's just a really confusing way to tell a story. Maybe a timeline at the end of the book would have helped, but I suspect she should have just dropped the metaphor anvil and told the story in the normal chronological order. Still, it is interesting, with some beautiful imagery and interesting characters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much! The only thing that i would like to change is that when you buy new locations you should be able to switch back to the one that you've already bought  without paying again. (Not real money.)
B003QTWR08|5.0|Nothing beats watching a beautifully animated film in HD, now if only I could a 4K version of this along with a 4K TV...

B009KS4XRO|3.0|When I started playing this application a year and a few months give or take, Bingo Blitz was exciting!  To me, seeing the idea behind the applications, the  entire set up was amazing. The originators meant free bingo as there was no limit on gifts, no outrageously priced rooms with pieces that were impossible to win!  Everyone took their time to enjoy the rooms and slots. Of course they offered credits and coins for sale! But there was no rushing to complete rooms and such. NO PRESSURE TO BUY!!<br />Now that the site has been sold, there are limits on everything free, the Cove prices alone caused a boycott. It's like the Indy 500 to get the room complete. Before BB was relaxing and fun. Now... I am sad to say, Bingo Blitz is all about the dolla.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Love this app! Very simple and seems to do the job. Cleaned running apps very quickly and kind of cool the stuff it showed me that I did not know was running.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My granddaughters loves it and all the Tinker Bell moves. Will watch over and over. Good story about sister love
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|Some of Tom Selleck's finest work no doubt. As part of the Paradise series, which probably could easily be compared to the style of Clint Eastwood's Mystic River. This and the series of mysteries adapted from the books of Robert E. Parker, are about a cop who left Los Angeles after loosing his job from drinking, and to escape the pitfalls of a wife who was sleeping her way to stardom, discovers a town that accepts him as an anomaly. Sincere and touching story about bad and good.
B005HSL626|5.0|You can play bonus games like: frenzy, 2x, freeze, and bombs! But your 10 points go - they DON'T GO UP! And also you can buy stuff at the store there!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Absolutely love the visuals! The sound track is fantastic as well.  It is definitely not a movie to watch once.  Much like Momento (another absolute favorite of mine) it takes a bare minimum of two viewings to put the whole thing together.<br /><br />And of course the girls are worth watching even if you hate the rest!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book. Really lived up to being part 2 of the shining. Stephen king is brilliant and psycho all at the same time which I love
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I appreciate the fact that Imangi Studios is trying to make a knew temple run and I guess that's okay. But here's the thing. Temple run is better than temple run two. I want the old temple run back and whenever I try to get on it says &quot;force close app isn't responding.&quot;  That's not cool guys. I want to play the origanal. Not this new crape. So you can get this app if you want but it will never be as good as the first and now I cant play my favorite game just beacause the company wants more money...?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Well done, my fellow Mainah. Goodness. Well done.<br /><br />This story pulled me through like no other. I have neglected housework and errands for the past couple of days because of the beautiful and genius story telling...and, by the way, will never look at RVs the same.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, somewhat juvenile, but ok ... different twist on Hansel and Gretel story.  Glad I didn't see it in the theater because of the cost ... but cost not bad through Amazon Video Rental.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I like Adele so I really enjoy the songs on this album.  I would recommend if you like this style of music.
B00DXP7L88|3.0|***Spoilers Ahead***<br /><br />As a fan of Dexter throughout, there were high hopes of a great ending to this show after the series resurrected in Season 7. Although this season had some great moments, it became impossible to ignore aspects of the show that were too unbelievable or didn't make sense:<br /><br />1. Deb walked in to Miami Metro drunk to confess that she killed LaGuerta and all but nothing happens. Really? Would that happen in real life where a drunken cop walks in to a police station and makes a major public confession all to have it virtually ignored?<br /><br />2. From the end of Season 7 into early this season, Deb changed her mind about Dexter's life 3 times. Deb drives their car off into a swamp all but to realize she needed to save Dexter's life...again (referring to the fact that she could have killed him instead of LaGuerta at the end of Season 7). And all that is addressed is a 5 minute counselling session with Vogel afterwards. That's it? Deb is impulsive, but not that impulsive. Also, wouldn't this incident be talked about the next day at Miami Metro as being a little odd?<br /><br />3. At the end, Dexter looks straight into the camera, resembling a horror movie preparing for a sequel. He also drives his boat into a hurricane leaving it in pieces and he somehow survives.  A stretch on reality.  It would have made more sense if Dexter had sacrificed himself based on the self-knowledge that he would have eventually harmed Hannah and Harrison.  This would have been consistent with Vogel's view that he might have been capable of at least some empathy when observing him with Hannah.  The Dexter story has been told and it was time to close the book in the final season - the last scene left a door open.<br /><br />4. At one point in the series, 3 serial killers (Zach, Hannah and Dexter) were having dinner together with Vogel, who herself was enabling the murders to continue.  This scene in of itself is hard to imagine realistically happening.<br/><br />5. To create great suspense, the good guys and the bad guys both have to be smart. Throughout Season 2, it was never known if Dexter would be caught and how, and we had a great performance by Keith Carradine as Agent Lundy asking hard questions.  In this season, with the exception of tracking down Hannah, the cops weren't asking enough questions.<br /><br />This season had a great start introducing us to Vogel as an expert on psychopathy, a great idea because the whole series has been based on a character study of Dexter.  Although it did over some insight into psychopathy through Vogel, it could have offered more: was Dexter actually a psychopath capable of some empathy or feelings towards others?  What is the criteria for being a psychopath?  Is there any treatment for psychopathy?  And what effect does psychopathy have on their offspring?<br /><br />Getting into the grey areas of plausibility was part of the downfall of seasons 5 and 6. It's disappointing this season wasn't able to combine factors from previous seasons that worked so well to make a believable, suspenseful and insightful finish to what has been a great series.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like the app.  It takes me where I want to go quickly.  I would recommend this app to anyone interest in Pinterest.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|It's totally my favorite bingo site. You have team mates to share your «wealth» with, swap gifts with ,free power-ups, keys , coins, slot spins & bingo tickets<br />to send as gifts every day. Helps all team mates to fill the various cities to earn extra tickets on your daily gift. That's what makes this site way more fun.  They do have downsides also. Your site can freeze up, the daily spin doesn't always go right (I have yet to hit the mega daily spin you get told in 4/5 more days- yeah not happening!).You buy extra power-ups or keys (they take your money) but the product gets lost in cyberspace. Yet I have kept playing frustration & all , it's still the best & most fun bingo site by far.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I have no adequate words to express my admiration for this true American hero.  Mr Blehm was absolutely masterful in telling this young man's story.  The reader feels like they know this young Navy Seal personally.  The author has brought to the American public's attention a story that had to be told.  I am personally very humbled to know that we only send our very best to fight and die for our precious freedoms.  As I was reading always in the back of my mind was the thought that even now on some faraway forsaken no man's land young men and women are risking all they have to give for their country America.  God help us if we ever forget what they have done.  The author has created a masterpiece!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|One of the best I've played! The graphics were really good, interesting story line over all. I really liked that you got as many free hints as you needed about where to go next. I liked that there were so many different scenes to explore so it never got boring.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A delightful story and a gem of a novel. Reminiscent of Stephen King, but kinder. Sometimes dark, sometimes sweet, but always well crafted.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I've used kik before, but get it on here and can't log on, it keeps saying it's taking longer than it should have, I try again to no avail. So right now I'd like to give no stars because it doesn't even work.
B009LDD4V4|4.0|One of the things I liked most about \\"Bones\\" was that each season was pretty much self-contained. There were story arcs that spanned multiple episodes through the season (such as the Gravedigger and Gormogon storylines) and ongoing plot developments (such as the truth about Brennan's parents and Hodgins' and Angela's developing relationship) but by and large each season wrapped up the loose ends by or in the season finale. Unfortunately, that pattern has been broken with the introduction of Christopher Pelant. While I realize that the forensics team members require a challenge equal to their considerable abilities to keep the show interesting, some of Pelant's technological feats are, quite frankly, ridiculous and highly contrived. That, however, isn't the true problem with the concept. Pelant (much as Red John in \\"The Mentalist\\") is a loose end whom the writers have allowed to remain one step ahead of the protagonists and can continue to do so indefinitely. Eventually it gets tedious to sit through yet another Pelant episode knowing that, regardless of how brilliantly Booth, Brennan, and the squints work through the evidence and close in, the writers can and probably will reveal that it was yet another manipulative ploy by Pelant who had complete knowledge of what everyone was up to all along by spying on them through clock radios, microwave ovens, and other networked appliances and so could circumvent their efforts. Undoubtedly Pelant eventually will be brought to justice. The only extremely irksome question about that is how long the writers intend to milk the situation.<br /><br />That said, the chemistry between Boreanaz and Deschanel remains as engaging as ever, and the humor (dark and morbid as it sometimes is) helps to keep the series fresh and well worth watching on the whole.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Keep up the good work<br />Great job<br />Have a great book to read Sarah to person who loved books love sarah
B009LDD1X0|4.0|The Big Bang Theory is my favorite comedy and the past seasons have kept me thoroughly entertained despite nearly being able to recite the dialogue word for word with the characters. Unfortunately this season showed some extremely weak and ill-considered episodes that I actually didn't bother to watch in the reruns. These episodes specifically featured Raj's attempts to strike up a relationship with an agoraphbic woman named Lucy (played by Kate Micucci). Between Raj's selective mutism and her inability to interact with groups I can't figure out how the writers thought a story arc with them pseudo-dating would be worth watching or mesh with the other characters, and can't help wondering if Lorre just was trying to fit someone with whom he had previously worked into the show. Quite literally I would go from laughing out loud at scenes with the other cast members to absolute silence at transitions to scenes with these two. Hopefully this character will never return.<br /><br />Despite that, there are some priceless episodes that make the 6th season DVD set worthwhile and I look forward to enjoying them over and over at my leisure.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I like this game but it takes too long to build up dollars, and takes to long and too much money to evolve your dinosaurs.Takes too long to get anywhere in this game.

Please fix it! I love this app!
B001HN6922|3.0|While this one is not basically an uncredited remake of Doc Hollywood with anthropomorphic cars, it does come up with a rather daffy storyline that will probably disinterest most adults rather quickly. The good parts are still there: Michael Caine, while no Paul Newman, is a respected industry veteran and Larry TCG as Mater is one of the true under-recognized yet exceedingly well-done characters, maybe ever...even if you're not a fan of his schtick and other work. There is a Mater short on here, but you can easily skip it -- unless you really want to watch an excessively long ad for the &#34;Planes&#34; movie. Other than that, Bruce Campbell shows up, as one of the few redeeming spots of this movie, alas too briefly before being disposed of and the animation is the typical highly competent job that Disney/Pixar are known for.
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|Very nice book with a lot of visual elements that helps people to understand better the business model generation and teach people to use a framework for brainstorming ideas.
B00CCEHX5W|5.0|It's impossible to expect what this album delivers. It's a very cohesive, atmospheric, yet also incredibly intense sort of death metal meets concept album meets seemingly random and somewhat fascinating soundclips. It will be near impossible to make out actual words in the shrieked vocals, which seem to be used more like another instrument than conveyance of lyrical content, but the overall effect is one of pure genius and majesty. Definitely an album not to be missed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|But even if you don't, thanks for writing this. Wool was so great, and so original. I love sci-fi and dystopian stories but often get lost/disinterested in scifi novels. But not in Wool. I couldn't put it down. So good. I'm craving to read more and that says a lot. Thanks Hugh!
B00005JLEU|3.0|My wife is a big fan of Miyazaki, but that entire style of filmmaking holds little interest to me...until they try to make live action versions of these...that aside, this one was overall a bit too long, but very memorable and an intriguing storyline. It also elicited some rather amusing sidetracks from my son, who picked things out of it seemingly at random, which is always enjoyable.

B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Closer to the Truth is Cher's first album in over a decade, but she really delivered with this one. The first 6 songs are all great dance songs, with my favorite in this section being Lovers Forever. A couple of these tracks make very heavy use of autotune, but Cher is able to make it work. The last 5 songs are either midtempo or ballads, and they all show off Cher's amazing and unique voice. She can still give great emotional deliveries at 67 years old. My favorites in this section are I Hope You Find It and I Walk Alone. The deluxe edition bonus tracks are also noteworthy, with I Don't Have to Sleep to Dream and Pride both being great dance tracks, and You Haven't Seen the Last of Me from Burlesque still being an amazing ballad.<br /><br />What I know is that I can't wait to hear these songs live on the Dressed to Kill Tour, and I really hope Cher doesn't wait 12 years to realize the next album, especially when she's capable of making something this good at this point in her career. Her peers don't make music this contemporary and good, while Cher continues to progress forward, as this album sounds completely fresh and in place for 2013. Cher can still make better pop music than all of the younger singers like Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift, even if this album may not get the radio play it deserves, which is a true shame, as so many of these songs could be hits with proper airplay.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|At last something I can see doing for the rest of my life.  I saw Michael Mosley's Horizon documentary and it peaked my interest.  The big thing about this is not so much the potential for weight loss, although that will happen, it is the long term health benefits that are also derived.  Glad I went the extra step and read this book.  It fills in a lot of blanks. Highly recommended.

B00F2362IE|2.0|This app is not worth $3.99.  It takes too long to lowe between games and is quite boring.  My 5 year old played it twice and then asked me to delete it!  We have downloaded free apps that were much more entertaining than this.  Wish I could get my money back :(
1401937519|5.0|She was dead of cancer and just waiting for the clock to stop ticking. Her body riddled with golf-ball sized lymph cancers, and organs failing. Visiting the &#34;other side&#34;, she describes an amazing reality of the space beyond time that surrounds our limited glimpse, and the web of relationships between our loved ones, that go beyond space and time. Then she decided to return to finish her life, and the cancer vanished in a few days, and failed organs came back to life. She had wasted away and had a huge skin ulcer, that the plastic surgeon could not find only days later. It shows that we are beings of energy and not flesh, and how powerful our alignment with self is.<br /><br />The first half of the book sets the stage for a women struggling against her cultural limitations and her own fears, which shows why she developed cancer, but it went longer than necessary. The book would have benefited from some editing, but it is still very powerful.

B003L77G8I|5.0|I have to walk very delicately with what I say about the episodes in this season, since the last two episodes bring an end to a very long ark, which has had its ups and downs since season 1. If you have seen season six, you know of the cliff hanger, which had five of the six team members travelling to far flung corners of the world, for a year. In the hiatus between seasons, the Jeffersonian Medico-Legal Laboratory is transformed into an exhibit for a mastodon, and the one member remaining behind, Camille Saroyan, gets into a jam, and is about to be fired (for no good reason). Our favorite federal prosecutor, Caroline Julian, brings all the team members back to save Cam's bacon.<br /><br />Honestly, I think the rotating \\"squinterns\\" replacing Zach Addy may just be a bit better than the multi-talented Zach himself (but it would be keen to see him again, maybe once a season, the way Ryan O'Neal is brought back for 1 or 2 episodes per season. The longest arc in the season is Booth's new girlfriend, Hannah, which puts a chill on the possible romantic relation between Booth and Brennan. (This is a technique used before, in the second season, when Brennan hooked up with Booth's FBI colleague, Scully.)<br /><br />Overall, the season does a lot to pump up Booth's capabilities as a sniper. In passing, we get the sense that Booth, like Ian Edgerton in the Numb3rs series, is one of the best snipers in the Bureau, if not in the world. He proves that at least once in this season.<br /><br />One thing which distinguishes this season from others is that it has a spin-off episode, which never resulted in a series. Virtually all the episodes were up to the standard of the previous season, and the main story arcs did good service in advancing the overall theme of the series.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I own this collection on DVD so I thought that I also wanted to have it on Blu-ray because my DVD collection is just about worn out because I have watched it so many times!!!!!!!!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I was very impressed by this story. It manages to tell an imaginative, thoughtful tale in only 178 pages. Many authors don't seem to realize that quantity doesn't equal quality and drag out their scenes until your eyes glaze over. This book never did that. To quote Goldilocks, it was just right. Definite recommendation.
B000003S0I|5.0|LTIA represents a change in Fripp's aesthetics, turning from acoustic textures and orchestral gestures that made up the first four KC albums with decidedly diminished returns to a new, harder, more improvisational edge.  The effect is electric, strange, and daunting.  The new band consisted of Fripp, Wetton, Bruford, Cross and lunatic Jaime Muir whose stay was too brief.  Influenced by the Mahavishnu Orchestra, this new band eschewed horns to take up the violin, a not wholly successful experiment.  Where the MO never denied their Jazz origins, KC had to adhere to rock textures more surely.<br />Fripp's guitar dominates this album, as it all KC releases, but rather than using the instrument as running commentary (see Lizard), he now uses his black Les Paul to made strong declamations in favor of chaos.  Admittedly, Fripp's history shows that he attempted to jam (see Moonchild) with mixed results.  He lacked the players, or in this case, the minions to effect the jazz-rock compositions he now wanted to produce.  Bruford especially fell under Fripp's thrall, leaving an up and coming commercial breakout with Yes, to mine the dark diamonds of KC.  Now, working with the domineering perfectionist Fripp, Bruford could indulge his Jazz predilections without constraints.  Wetton, a journeyman bassist and vocalist landed in KC and rose to the occasion.  The other two players, Cross and Muir must've been in a state of shock.  Essentially a power trio, the new KC's vision included dynamics, sudden musical shifts, and longer pieces.<br />The new KC lays down the gauntlet.  I remember buying this album, expecting to hear something like \\"I Talk to the Wind,\\" instead I stood at the gates of hell, gazing forthrightly into the abyss. I didn't know what to make of the music, but then I understood.  KC was always the best of the Prog rock stream.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is very addicting. It is nothing fancy very basic, but for some reason I can't get enough of it.
0802136834|5.0|As a novice of English history I was given enough information (without being overwhelmed) from \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\". I am now particularly fascinated by Anne Boleyn's life story. This book shows clearly how many of Henry VIII's wives were unfortunate pawns in an autocratic era, with a terrifying despot at the helm. Alison Weir doesn't over-complicate descriptions when going into further detail of each life, writing in a manner that encouraged me to continue learning more. This book is definitely staying on my shelf.

B00AO3K01C|5.0|This. Is. JUST. My. Kind. Of. Book. An esoteric blend of reality and fantasy served up with a generous dose of magic! The magic comes from the nuanced characters that get under your skin and burrow into your psyche, from their life stories that are real enough to convince yet fantastical enough to entice, and from the questions asked and answers received. This is my first book by Ozeki and I'm blow away by how intimately she tackles a wide range of issues - bullying, coming of age, relationships, family, faith,empathy, dreams, belief systems - in a single book, without once seeming preachy or condescending. She allows the reader complete and utter freedom to interpret her words and her characters and offers no judgment...incredibly clever and mature writing this.<br /><br />Nao is unforgettable. So is Jiko. I wonder how much of one Ruth is in the other! Oliver is intriguing as is Nao's Dad. I wish there was more detail on Nao's Mom but I understand why she's in the background. She, along with Babette and Muji and Kayla and all of Nao's classmates form the backdrop against which the story is played out. I love how Nao's and Ruth are so similar in such an organic way and how Ozeki reveals their similarities at an unhurried pace, although I'm not sure reveal is the right word. More like a slow realisation that dawned on me as the story progressed...for at first glance what could a 16-yr-old girl living in Japan possibly have in common with a woman in her fifties (my assumption in the absence of an exact age), married and living on an isolated Canadian island? And there in lies the tale - of time beings, for time beings, by a brilliant time being! For once, the Bookers have chosen a book that is as readable as it is thought-provoking! I hope it wins :) Read it People!

I have a master's degree and it seems to me like this is more of an academic piece than one written for a business audience. Yes, there is some good content in the book. But most people won't hang around long enough to get to it. Second piece of advice: Know your audience.<br /><br />I am not finished yet and I can say there is a good chance I won't get to the end.

B004VMVTNU|4.0|Very good app. Would be excellent if it would sync across multiple devices like the Kindle tablet and android phone. Plus the ability to ignore the sync by individual device/alarm. A really cool thing would be adding an offset on a device/alarm base. I like my phone to ring on time, then the kindle 5 minutes later. I do not always have both. It is too confusing when they both go off at same time. Which way do I go, which way do I go, ...

B00D7OXUIK|4.0|I like these interpretations.  I was rather dubious about the piano/violin combination, but for me it works well here.  It's an interesting perspective and in places is very beautiful.<br /><br />Both Michelle Makarski and Keith Jarrett are very good musicians who have an excellent sense of what Bach's music is about.  That essential rhythmic pulse is there when needed and, although Makarski is a little freer with the vibrato and rubato than I would like in places, it's by no means excessive and both she and Jarrett judge ornamentation very well.  They combine together with great precision and the effect is often very engaging, but I did find that they seem oddly disengaged from each other in places.  Perhaps it's just me, but in the Largo of the G major Sonata, for example, there somehow seems to be a sense of two instruments being played perfectly in tune and time but almost in separate worlds.  I can't quite put my finger on why and you may disagree, but it does disconcert me from time to time in these discs.<br /><br />Small personal feelings aside, this is a good recording of these fine works and one I'm glad to have.  Obviously, this set is very suitable if you'd like to hear the sonatas well played on piano and violin.  I have three treasured recordings for violin and harpsichord which won't be superseded in my affections by this set, but I would still recommend it as a set of often interesting and enjoyable performances.<br /><br />(For a violin and harpsichord recording, I'd probably recommend Rachel Podger and Trevor Pinnock [[ASIN:B00005056Z Bach: Complete Sonatas for Violin and Obbligato Harpsichord /Podger · Pinnock]], but I also love the recordings by Andrew Manze and Richard Egarr [[ASIN:B00003Z9UY Bach: Violin Sonatas]] and by Viktoria Mullova and Ottavio Dantone [[ASIN:B000PFU8MA Bach - Violin Sonatas]].)
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Very clean and clear UI. Easy to set up an alarm (or multiple alarms) - days it goes off, times, message for when it goes off. The ability to make individual alarms give you a math problem to solve before you can dismiss it is ingenious - I don't usually think so when I'm blearily trying to solve it, but it does work to get your brain going long enough to remember you really DO have to get up. The math problems can be set from easy to hard. I keep mine on easy, and haven't seen what is considered 'hard' yet - with my luck I'd be trying to solve an algebra formula and never get to turn it off. In any case, it's a great little app and I don't know how I got along without it before!

B008J05EL8|1.0|Very disappointed that the Font Package did not install on my Kindle Fire Hd 8.9. Looking at other Amazan reviews of this package, noted that majority of the persons had similar problems and gave one star.

Otherwise there will not be so many unhappy customers there.<br /> I will suggest to Amazan to remove this application from the store until they fix it. While I will be requesting the refund.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|This album left me speechless. Every single track is memorable and innovative, with plenty to enjoy whether you listen with your head, or your heart (or both, like I do).<br /><br />Of particular note is the mix. Never before has John Myung been so far to the fore; the bass is punchy without being overpowering. The drums (oh, god, the drumming! Mangini sounds like he has four arms!) are also very present. My main criticism of the last album was that the drums were so far back in the mix that half the time you had to really concentrate to hear them. It sounds like they heard this from enough people that they decided to put Mangini in the spotlight this time. This adds a note of urgency to each track; the pulse is omnipresent and driving. As an added bonus, in the last track the drums cut out for an extended orchestral interlude, giving our ears a much-needed break and some textural contrast as well (nice of them to use a real string orchestra; I've heard my fill of synthesized strings on metal albums -- I'm looking at you, Symphony X).<br /><br />Most of the songs are shorter than average for DT, but they were nice enough to throw a 20-odd minute epic on the end for those of us who like to sit down for a bit.<br /><br />One thing that might be worth mentioning is that the lyrical content has taken a decidedly preachy and \\"inspirational\\" tone. I'm not sure whether this is Mangini's influence or just the fact that most of them are pushing fifty, but it's definitely noticeable. If you're a dyed-in-the-wool metal fan who likes dark themes this album might not be for you.<br /><br />Overall, as JP said, \\"life in Dream Theater-land is great!\\". Looking forward to another 20 years of great output from this band.

B008532S54|5.0|Hopefully, if you are a prude, you have bounced right past my review.  This movie is certainly rated R and not for all audiences.  With that being said, Paul Rudd is probably my favorite actor in this side splitting comedy.  Many of my friends use quotes from this movie on a daily basis.  After you've seen it, you'll know why.  If you're over 30 then you should definitely be able to relate to this film in more than one way.  Sometimes we all wish we could escape from the hampster wheel of life.  These guys show us what it's like to do just that.  Purchasing the DVD is awesome because you get the blooper reel!  Be prepared to laugh your behind off.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|Main issue with this book is that the TV series has dialogue almost word for word so, if you have seen the first season of Dexter on ShowTime, don't expect the book to have any surprises.  It was good but I wasn't expecting the book to read like the script of the show.
B000FC1AGG|2.0|I thought this would be a good \\"at the beach\\" read for my honeymoon. I had already finished the three other books I brought with me, and saw that this one had about 4.5 stars on average on amazon, and for a girly/chic book, that is a pretty good rating so I decided to give it a go. The dialogue is poorly written, and so many parts are just not realistic in any way. The whole feel of the book was just awkward and nothing to get excited about. I read about a third of the book before I actually decided to give up on it based on the other reviews I read that said \\"if you don't like it by half way through, it doesn't get better.\\" Next time I don't have a book to read, maybe I will pick it up and finish it. If my opinion changes, I will update my review, although I don't see that happening.

B00BEIYP1W|5.0|This could so easily have just been another race movie, like 'Days of Thunder' and appealed to the petrolheads exclusively. However, with Ron Howard at the helm and a tremendous true story to work from, this film was simply brilliant.<br /><br />Rush follows the rivalry between Formula One drivers James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Bruhl). Two men who are poles apart in their approach to their chosen profession but both driven by the same ultimate goal.<br />Understandably, there is a degree of dramatisation of the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda, including the fabrication of events that never happened and omitting certain interesting facts: such as Hunt and Lauda shared a flat in London early on in their careers.<br /><br />The chemistry between Hemsworth and Bruhl is brilliant. Hemsworth's portrayal of Hunt was excellent and there wasn't a trace of his native Aussie tongue in his upper-crust English accent! Bruhl as the clinical Lauda was nothing short of perfect and both lead actors performances made for compelling viewing.<br /><br />Perhaps having an American at the helm led to a more balanced film as Hunt and Lauda were both portrayed as very human and flawed characters where it would have been so easy to simply portray them as mere stereotypes; and I was glad that neither man was characterised as the villain of the piece.<br /><br />Although I commented that this wasn't a film just for petrolheads, I don't think F-1 fans will be left disappointed. I was particularly impressed by the race scenes and the authenticity of the film in general, capturing the essence of the mid-1970s beautifully. The story itself is intelligent with a touch of humour but due to the subject matter, is also exciting and times deeply dramatic. The tragedy that befell Lauda is dealt with admirably and in unflinchingly real fashion. Lauda himself has commented on its portrayal in this film. Additionally, Rush does not shy away from Hunt's use of drugs, failed marriage and also sensitively narrated his passing.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of Formula One or motor racing in general but to date, Rush is unquestionably my film of the year.vely narrated his passing.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of Formula One or motor racing in general but to date, Rush is unquestionably my film of the year.

B009LDCZ7I|3.0|First season of Homeland.<br />No Spoilers.<br /><br />Homeland is a good show. Not great, just good. Solid acting, dynamic editing, dramatic music; all make for pleasing television viewing. It's a little boring though.<br /><br />While Homeland gets rave reviews from US audiences - not entirely uncalled for - I suspect they (most likely You, reading this) have not seen the original show, from which it is ported over. The average US viewer possibly doesn't even know Homeland is a re-make. That's why I said its only a good show.<br /><br />The original is called \\"Prisoners of War\\" or \\"Abductees\\". It is an Israeli production.<br /><br />Now, where I would give Homeland 3 stars, I would give Prisoners of War 5 stars. Why such a difference? Well, a point immediately deducted for the US needlessly re-making & dumbing-down yet another \\"foreign\\" production....<br /><br />The other point is lost for general quality in comparison. Had Homeland been original, I would probably give it 4 stars. Because it's pretty good - it would be very good for the USA. But when I compare it to the Israeli original, it just doesn't cut the mustard.<br /><br />The original has something that all production bosses (TV or movie) don't think Americans can understand or tolerate; subtlety. Apart from the top-notch - subtle yet intense - acting, the original has a slower & convoluted precision, a studied & intelligent approach to the material. It's also delicate in it's delivery.<br /><br />What I'm trying to say is: See the original Prisoners of War. It's better.<br /><br />Homeland is great for US audiences, which is all that matters really, as it's an American show. Like I said: solid acting, dynamic editing, dramatic music. It's got it all. The take on the material is good, the plot's fairly interesting, it's striving to be something above most insufferable US TV shows. So I can't really complain.<br /><br />3 stars.

B000I0XLYO|5.0|Hilarious characters, situations, and overall storyline. If you haven't seen it, watch it! There are so many memorable scenes and scenarios . . . and, of course, model looks.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|awesome game...challenging but doable. clues are very clever and graphics are good. I like that there are different. rooms on each level and not the same theme each time
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Good story but not Hosseini's best :(<br />The intersection of the characters lives was a great idea but the way it took form seemed interrupted, as though the &#34;abscence&#34; gradually became inconsequential. I was disappointed that Adel and his mother's story was not fully developed, caught a glimpse of an odd friendship and an elightenment happening in Adel's behalf. I sincerly hope Hosseini considers these characters and their story more in depth for another novel.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I was rolling with laughter throughout this entire story. Emma does a wonderful job telling this story and I would love to see this made into a rom-com one day. Just an overall joyful love story to read. You won't be disappointed.

B0085TKAW6|5.0|As with all his books, Ken has written a captivating novel with  rich tapestry of characters and story plots, all intertwined for maximum effect and enjoyment.  If you don't have time to read this whole book, don't pick it up because I guarantee you won't put it down!
B008602KQI|2.0|I didn't get past 45 minutes.  It is not my kind of movie. Just wanted to see why there was so much talk about it.
141690977X|2.0|I decided to buy this book after watching the movie and realizing that it was based on a book. However, the book is written as a series of Q and A's, not a story like the movie portrays it. I was not thrilled with it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love this game! The only thing I wish was different is that it is difficult to explore some rooms because you have to buy items to enter. I love that this is free and don't want to spend my money on those things, I would rather buy books!
B005CRQ2XA|2.0|It was a really good book to read this book I one of my favorite series I love these people who make these books
B0076DEJMO|4.0|I have always enjoyed Mr. Abercrombie's sense of a story.  The bad guys are bad, the good guys are worse. In this case, bad guy turned reluctant hero, but still a bad guy.<br />A bad guy in hiding, trying to a better man, chasing kidnappers.  This just sets the stage for the bloody mess to follow.<br />All in all, a good read.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Stunning. A true work of art. This may be my favorite book ever! A must read for your collection. I am deeply touched.
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|Being a fan of \\"The ArchAndroid,\\" yet being slightly hesitant with the sound of \\"Dance Apocalyptic\\" (a grower that ended up growing on this listener for sure), I was intrigued by Janelle Monae's newest offering \\"The Electric Lady.\\" After listening on Spotify once, I immediately browsed Amazon to order my CD/AutoRip combo. As with her last album, the cohesion of this record as an overall piece as opposed to a few disjointed singles interspersed between filler is admirable and effective at pulling the listener in. It sounds like a night listening to the radio (if the interludes didn't already set the mood), making it a true listening experience (and \\"What an Experience,\\" indeed, Ms. Monae).<br /><br />Highlights<br /><br />Q.U.E.E.N.<br />Dance Apocalytic<br />The Electric Lady<br />Both the Overtures (I LOVE this about her albums)<br />Primetime<br />Ghetto Woman<br />Victory

B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was so looking forward to reading this book since the kite runner is one of my favourite  books. I enjoyed this book greatly especially his descriptive passages and how in the end he tied all his characters together.  It is a heart warming story but I still like the kite runner more.
B006PTL1GC|4.0|A very interesting entry from director David Cronenberg that stars Viggo Mortensen and the beautiful Keira Knightley. Michael Fassbender steals the show as Dr. Carl Jung. A Dangerous Method is part biographical, part drama and part thriller. It is an exploration of psychology and the men behind it: Dr. Sigmund Freud and Dr. Carl Jung. The movie starts in 1904. I would say the portrayal of Dr. Jung is not completely flattering because the film does poke some fun at both men and offers witty dialogue. I was pleasantly surprised by this film and would say most students of psychology and fans of the director will appreciate it. It's not a documentary but you can have fun with it. Some of the director's sense of humor comes through when Jung and Freud are eating together. It's subtle but laugh out loud funny at times. The picture quality in this release is superb and the audio is almost as amazing. Sony did an excellent job on the transfer. My only complaint is that Cronenberg's \\"new flesh\\" signature is absent from this film unlike his classic work (Scanners, Videodrome, Existenz). There is also 39 minutes of bonus content and an audio commentary. Ignore the bad reviews (3.4 stars on Amazon) because if you like psychology and Cronenberg you won't be disappointed. Admittedly it's not for everybody because it is dialogue oriented and obviously psychological in content.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />Subtitles/Captions: English, English SDH, Spanish<br />Special Features: Commentary with David Cronenberg, The Making of A Dangerous Method featurette, AFI's Harold Lloyd Master Seminar with David Cronenberg<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|I really enjoyed the variety of characters.  The acting was excellent and I am looking forward to watching future episodes
B003Y3ZHUS|4.0|Bay of Blood/Twitch of the Death Nerve is a legendary horror film from director Mario Bava. In the Arrow Video region-free release, the picture quality is great but the sound is average. There is a decent amount of supplements for the film believed to have inspired Friday the 13th and its first sequel. The Kino Classic release is fairly similar with the same problems but contains much less bonus content. Many Bava fans consider this film a must own for their collection.<br /><br />Arrow Video Special Features:<br />- Reversible sleeve with original and newly commissioned art work<br />- Double-sided fold-out poster<br />- Collector's Booklet by Jay Slater, critic and author of Eaten Alive!<br />- Brand new high definition transfer of the English version of the film (1080p)<br />- 2 versions of the film including the Italian cut<br />- Original Mono Audio<br />- Twitch of the Death Nerve Radio Spots<br />- Argento! Bava! Fulci!

It has managed to hold its value.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I love this app but after the first month I noticed the app does a lot of &quot; pinterest has stopped&quot; and when I hit ok it force closes the app, why it doesn't have a reload option within the app boggles me but why does it crash so often is more of my concern @ the moment. When it does want to work it's fine and functions as it should but if the temper tantrum continues I will probably delete it and just use my desktop.

0679746323|5.0|This should be mandatory reading for all high school and/or college students!  China always has been and continues to be a secretive society.  Who knew that 50+ million good Chinese people died (many by starvation) under the reign of Mao; the answer is very few knew then and very few know now.  I feel sad for the Chinese people who had a rich cultural heritage that Mao and his communist cronies tried (with great success) to destroy.

B00AFROVQC|4.0|J R R it's not, it doesn't' have the scope of that work, but it's more akin to the work of Eddings, much more like the Belgariad in many ways. I enjoyed it, I haven't read a sword and sorcery in years and this well worth purchasing.

B00F7YHDWC|3.0|In my opinion it took too long to download. I had to wait about 30minutes just for it to download which really sucks if you ask me. It was a very long wait and it upsets me because of that. No app that I have downloaded before took that long so this was my review.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I have given this book high ratings because this story is engaging and unpredictable. I thought I knew how it would end and then I was pleasantly surprised by the turn of events. A book that focuses on the choices we make in life and their effects on ourselves and on our many relationships. I enjoyed this book and I would recommend it.
0385528787|5.0|This is the final book in the Trilogy of \\"Oryx and Crake\\" and \\"Year of the Flood\\". I believe if you had not read the first 2 novels in the series you would not really enjoy this final book - you would miss so much. Yes, Ms. Atwood does refer back to the other 2 books to explain, but there is just so much to connect to - as much of a feeling of the other 2 books, as just details<br /><br />This 3rd novel is about the survivors of the waterless flood gathering together for strength against their common enemy,the Painballers. Toby and Zeb have the largest parts in this book. They take the most chances to save the remaining survivors and the Crakers (recombined DNA humanoids). Toby's nightly stories to the Crakers  are full of both sadness and humor  - because the Crakers are so peace-loving that they almost seem like small children.<br /><br />This is not as action-packed as the other 2 novels - it is a winding down and a closing. I really enjoyed it though - especially Toby's comments and explanations to the Crakers  :)
B00CL0J99K|5.0|This movie may contain what some people call \\"non-human interaction\\", but after all it is a Science Fiction movie! I love it for all the CG \\"Computer Graphic\\" scenes! I like the out of the box thinking in the making of this movie! Yes it has the typical syfy / action plot and ending (predictable), but again you have to look at what type of movie it is! I love it! It rates second only to \\"The Avengers (2012 film)\\" movie!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|This is a good continuation to the first book of the series.  This book ends very much leaving the reader thinking, \\"That's it?!\\"  I wish the ends were a bit more tied up by the conclusion of this book.  It very much looks like someone took a giant book, and just separated it between chapters and called them separate books.<br /><br />I also feel, much like in the first book, someone badly needed to edit this book.  The author did a great job, but the editor seemed to be asleep, if one was used.  Pronouns were WAY too heavily used.  As an example from the book:<br /><br />\\"He saw Ulf go down with a crossbow bolt through the belly as he ran for the Great Hall. Maester Luwin was trying to reach him when a knight on a warhorse planted a spear between his shoulders, then swung back to ride over him. Another man whipped a torch round and round his head and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables.\\"<br /><br />Martin, George R.R. (2003-01-01). A Clash of Kings: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two (p. 700). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.<br /><br />From the above, I can tell you that the first instance of \\"He\\" refers to a guy named Theon. It seems Ulf got shot with a crossbow.  But which \\"he\\" ran for the great hall; Theon or Ulf? I presume Ulf was running, but... can't be sure.  Then we throw in Maester Luwin, who was trying to reach \\"him.\\" Was he trying to reach Theon or Ulf? I suspect Ulf, but... again, it isn't crystal clear.  Now, who on earth got a spear between the shoulders?  I haven't got any idea.  Even after completing the book, I don't know.  I know all three men end of dead as a result of that encounter, but I can't be perfectly sure which one got the spear in the shoulders.  It's not as though it is crucially important to the story as a whole, but...  If it's worth having in the story, shouldn't it be made clear?  And that's just one instance I thought of, off the top of my head.  The book is full of these kinds of things.<br /><br />Another complaint I have is the almost predictable redundancy; the over use of the same description for something.  Yeah, I know that's vague.  So, here's an example.  Everywhere, someone is \\"breaking his fast\\" or \\"breaking her fast\\" or \\"broke his fast\\" or \\"broke their fast\\" or some other variation of a fast being broken.  Never \\"for his morning meal\\" or \\"she began her day eating\\" or \\"his first order of business after dressing was to eat...\\"  Nope, anytime someone ate after they slept, it is referred to as a breaking of a fast.  Exclusively.  Same thing with everyone wearing \\"boiled leather.\\"  Boiled leather everywhere.  Can't we just call it leather SOMETIMES?  Very very redundant in some instances like that.<br /><br />Still. it's a book very much worth the read.>Another complaint I have is the almost predictable redundancy; the over use of the same description for something.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Although this isn't typically the type of book that I go for, I must admit that it was a good read. Always kept me on the edge of my seat. I do, however, completely hate the way the book ends. I suppose it does make you want to read the remaining books, however, it leaves way too many unanswered questions about the main characters.

B000FBJFSC|1.0|You're kidding me, right? Honestly, DO NOT waste your time on this book.  McCourt can't get past the themes of drunkenness and poverty and in no way makes his tale of woe interesting by his writing style, which is also hard on the eyes and the brain.<br /><br />I am 50 pages in and I can't stand it anymore.  I flipped ahead and it looks like more of the same for the rest of the book.  I think I'll just burn it and be done with it.<br /><br />One of my friends in the Catholic Writer's Guild told me to read this thing to study how to write a memoir.  If this is what I have to do to get national attention, if this is the whiny, poorly written nonsense I have to produce to get fans, I think I'll quit writing.  I have won two major writing awards with my short stories and I wouldn't think of writing something this bad.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It had GREAT descriptions. It was very intense, but also suspenseful in a good way. I was so sad to finish it though. But I hope there will be another book about what's going on in their lives and other stuff.
B00E0G5U4G|2.0|The anxiously awaited follow-up to the admittedly weak \\"Swan Song\\" LP, Surgical Steel is an amalgamation of the following subjenres:- thrash, death metal, grindcore, and power metal -  distilled, grinded, and cased into a pustulent, rotting mass of freshly cut gristle.

B009RH9J7W|3.0|Some things I really like about this case, some things annoy me.<br /><br />The good:<br />*It does seem to be decent quality, and sturdy.<br />*I like the fact that I can move the case around so the charging port is on the outside. Cases that require me to to leave case open to charge my kindle drive me nuts, which is why I bought this one.<br /><br />Minorly annoying (most of which are already mentioned in other reviews, I just didn't think they'd bother me):<br />*The plastic case is a bit resistant to move around, so I usually just leave it that way. I pretty much only use it for reading or basic web browsing, not video watching, so it's not a big deal, just a little annoying.<br />*I'm noticing streaks on my screen from the hand strap when the case has been closed.<br />*The Kindle doesn't always turn on when I open it, or shut off when I close the case, like it's supposed to.<br /><br />Starting to get on my nerves:<br />*The lack of stability when I'm holding the case in my hand and using the hand strap. Unless I hold down the Kindle with my thumb, the Kindle keeps moving and flapping around because the plastic case isn't secured to the back piece. It becomes awkward to hold pretty quickly.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I liked how Moriarty introduced the main characters in the first three chapters and then began subtly to weave their stories together.  She creates memorable characters and keeps the reader in suspense throughout the book.  A great book for discussion.

B00EB6ENXO|5.0|this is defiantly a turn from the others but not a bad turn it was amazing to see him out of his element and with none of his tech and have to rebuild. the ending had me sitting on the edge of my seat in suspense and surprise. this is a must watch if you watched the first two but only after watching the avengers or the things happening will seam out of place for him.

030758836X|1.0|If you're one of those people who agree that marriage is in trouble in our country and that getting married is a waste of time, you'll love this book.  I happen to agree that marriage, as a culture, is in serious trouble, but it is precisely because of the views of marriage presented in this book.  After reading this book, especially the unsatisfying, demented ending, I hugged my husband extra hard and thanked God above for 22 years of being married to my best friend.  There is no relationship presented in this book that gives a real view of married life.  Both Amy and Nick and Amy's parents are more caricature then character.  Ironically, I'd say Nick's parents' marriage was closer to the mark of what really exists on the unhappy end of the spectrum.  As for Amy's parents (I'm sorry but they take off to write another book about her ordeal - and these people are all trained psychologists?), do past middle-aged couples really walk by each other and give their butts a squeeze.  Thanks to the author for that imagery.  I must admit that I got an early impression that I wouldn't like the cynical take on marriage so I ended up skim reading a lot of this book.  I'm thankful I didn't waste more time because the couple of hours spent on it was too much.  One star reviews are for books that I wish I could get the time back I spent reading them.  This book is \\"zero\\" stars because I feel like I should be given my time back and then some.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I love this game, it's one of my favorite racing games on my kindle. Even my daughter likes it, best the way to kill time the quickest.
B00F87A7HG|5.0|Great new release from a great band. Back to basics but still progressing all at the same time. Very solid release!
B00CKR63F2|4.0|This was a refreshing fantasy story and one with its foundations in American Indian beliefs. I loved the shape-shifters, the spirit animal totems and the overall magic and wonder beyond Bridalveil Fall. Oria, the young protagonist, is thrown into a new world. Where she learns she is The Golden Queen and that great evil is stirring. This is a tale that was enjoyable to read from page to page. The characters were unique and well developed. I liked the thread of humour running through. And cared about the characters and feared the dangers they faced.<br />The Author handles the story well. Beyond Bridalveil Fall is a well written story. The only thing I would say is that it has a number of typos. This did not detract my attention too much from the story.
B00BMQTY3U|5.0|This a most refreshing cd from a new yet old school sounding artist.  He is the modern day James Brown with his own little take on the music he delivers.  Look into his back story and see how amazing it is to have him doing his thing finally on his own.  Just cant imagine what he may have done if he had been able to get his start at a younger age!

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I have always believed that knowing more about others, helps us to understand ourselves better - a mirror reflecting who we are or think we are. The characters in this book exist in all of their fragility so we can accept the fault in our OWN stars. Green has a novel about vulnerability that leaves us feeling triumphant and hopeful. Type of story I just had to finish and will choose my own perfect ending.
B0057UAE54|5.0|This is a classic and it should be in every ones collection!  Great album from a great artist!  You will always enjoy listening to this!

B0089LOG02|5.0|Heartbreaking and heartwarming story of hope that I couldn't put down until the last page was turned.  It may be a novel but you will wonder how close it really is to the stories of those who rode the Orphan Trains.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I Bought the Chromecast to use when I travel so I could use it with my IPad in my hotel room.  On my last trip, I could not get it to hook up with the hotel wireless network so I couldn't use it.  Disappointing.  Also, it only works with a limited number of streaming services so it does not have the range of use I had hoped.  It does work fine at home.  I will continue to try it when I travel and see if it works better at other hotels.  On the other hand, it did not cost too much so at least I'm not out a large amount of money.
B00479SVBU|4.0|I purchased two of these units (about 3 weeks apart from each other). The first unit was perfect, very strong signal, and no noise for other stations. The last one (received this week), still has a very strong signal, but creates too much noise for all the other radio stations. I basically have to remove it to listen to my NPR station which is usually very strong local signal.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|We were extremely excited for Chromecast and had high hopes.  This is probably why we were let down a bit.  Chromecast is a pain to setup.  You have to know a thing or two about your router which was fine for me since I work in IT, but I can imagine it is not for the standard user.  Once setup, I do enjoy being able to cast from any device, and note that this isn't streaming from your devices, but your devices are working like a remote control.  It can stream from your computer, but it's a bit choppy.  The biggest disappointment was that Chromecast currently only supports Netflix and Youtube (barely).  It's best for Netflix.  I was hoping that they would have more support for other services such as Amazon Prime Instant Stream, Hulu, etc., but no.  They say that more App support is coming, but I feel that releasing this product with such little supported Apps is kind of like releasing a beta product.  We did call Google for support and they were very helpful.  Overall, for $35 this is a neat little device.  The picture quality (netflix only) was exceptional.  It will be interesting to see how this device competes with Apple TV.
B004L03B3S|3.0|On the one hand the topic (the boundless love between two half-brothers in modern-day Brasil) has been carefully chosen and treated with a marvellous lightness of touch. Making the incest a non issue was a deliberate choice just as much as the well-to-do family setting which allows the viewer to concentrate entirely on the love story.<br />On the other hand direction and script do not keep their promise: they are inadequate and fail to convey the enormous emotional potential.<br /><br />Capable actors manage to counterbalance the film's flaws somewhat: J&uacute;lia Lemmertz in particular is a mother whose love for her family knows no limit; João Gabriel Vasconcellos as Francisco, the elder brother, brightens every scene he is in with his wonderful, vulnerable smiles.<br /><br />The end result is surely worth viewing but if some scenes stick to the viewer's memory is just because of the charming attractiveness of its young protagonists.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|Great game, not perfect, specially with the mayor  flaw that it keeps loging me out after every victory, sometimes causing that victory not to even count. Hope they fix it till then its just 3

B005GRF2UK|3.0|If you are a lover of this novel, as I am, then I already consider you a kindred spirit. I have read Jane Eyre yearly for many years now. I do believe that I have now seen every movie version ever made (including this one). Please, please, have you seen the 2007 Masterpiece Theater version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens? If not, then I beg of you to leave this item immediately and purchase it instead (Amazon sells it as well). After I saw THAT version, I got rid of all my other ones (including this one). It is the ONLY one. You will LOVE it. You will fall in love with Jane and Rochester all over again, they will break your heart. Please, please, friend, take my advice, watch it instead, and get out the tissues....
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Good book. Some is a little hard to believe.  A victim of domestic violence  is not  so hot and heavy for the first decent guy that comes around.  I will look for more from this author.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this. Jane Eyre is my favorite work of fiction. I have read it yearly for many years now. Jane is an old friend. I do believe that I have seen every movie version ever made, and this is the ONLY one that satisfies, well, more than satisfies. I cry like a fool through most of it, and for a good twenty minutes afterward. Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens bring the characters to life in a way never done before; You will fall in love with them, they will break your heart. The quality of the acting is unbelievable. I see that the screenplay was written by, and the movie was directed by, WOMEN, and you can tell. They obviously understood why lovers of this novel adore Jane and Rochester, and brought all those attributes to life...they are living, breathing people. They do not rush through the story, it is \\"by the book.\\" The scenery is lovely and the music is haunting. All the passion and pain and joy of this beautiful romance is felt keenly. Unless you are heartless, you will LOVE it. And don't forget the tissues.

B00EY8BRGU|4.0|A nicely paced popcorn movie that entertains from beginning to (almost) the end.  The weakness of the secondary ending can probably be attributed to its being a setup for a possible sequel.  Check your literary analysis at the door and enjoy a cleverly crafted romp with an interesting narrative.
B00EVRHE8E|5.0|I love reading. I've loved reading for quite a long time. If I get the chance--and, of course, if I really am good enough--, I even want to become an author some day. And that is why it is so hard for me to find books like this one. Sincere, pure, beautifully written stories with great characters and realistic dialogue.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell has just probably become one of my favorite writers. When I first learned about this book, I kept hearing people say she had an extraordinary talent for crafting characters as real as people. Half of the time, people saying things like that are wrong. This time, they certainly did not disappoint.<br /><br />Fangirl is a beautiful coming of age novel at its best. It is a love story, a story about family, about friendship, about discovering who you really are, who you want to be, and who you are meant to be. It is a story about believing in all of those little things that make life great, like the little kisses, small talks, or being able to create something wonderful with just the power of imagination.<br /><br />In many ways, I believe Fangirl is an ode to the art of writing and the power of fanfiction, but it is also an ode to that beautiful and scary feeling of having everything around you change, and learning you are destined to do it, too.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|This film is not for everyone. It is subtle, silent and overwhelming with violence. The visuals and the score are haunting. If you like it, you will love it and it will stay with you for a long time.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|The case is exactly as I expected. I needed a simple travel case to protect my Kindle from scratches and breaking. I haven't exposed it to a damaging situation so not sure how it would react if dropped or anything. It looks and fits well. The handle is slightly angled which isn't a huge deal but I do get a little OCD sometimes.. Would recommend this case to anyone.
B00E89VXQY|5.0|Every fan that has ever bought a ticket to a Tallica show should go see this movie in an IMAX theater.  Incredible camera angles, and sound perfection.  It's the ultimate concert experience with on stage action, and no obstructions.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A friend let me borrow this on Nook, and I didn't have very high expectations for it. But this is one of the few books that I really have a hard time putting down. If this book is any indication of the series, it may be right up there next to Ender's Game series as all-time favorite. Love the storyline and the characters!! I was going to borrow the other 2 from my friend but opted to buy them on my own kindle to support the author. I hope these books get the popularity they deserve. And maybe a movie.....? :-)
B000JMKRKC|4.0|Enjoyed the twist at the end. Bit slow in parts, but the overall story was better than I expected. Definitely a great audio book!

B0063M22QO|5.0|So far I have had no issues with this game. Very relaxing and fast moving. I am new to Kindle Fire and love the fact I can lose the mouse and tap for response. Makes for a very  enjoyable game. The tiles are are easy to distinguish between and larger than other of similar games. Highly recommend.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|I think this is the most consistent and best work Gov't Mule's put out yet. Every song on Shout! is excellent, and the bonus CD delivers as well - especially the cuts with Grace Potter and Steve Winwood.  Shout! is a must have for any GM fan, and a great introduction to the band if you haven't discovered them yet.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My wife suggested I read this after she did. I haven't read a book in quite a few years but this grabs your attention and keeps it through the entire book. It's not a hard read by any means but an enjoyable. I read half of it in one sitting on my flight from Detroit to Mexico city. Finished it two days later. I will be finishing the series for sure and the book reminded me on how much I used to enjoy reading!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|how do you update the game the game is very fun though dung Chung long bong fun had day time
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|I'd heard so much negativity surrounding 'After Earth', but I was very interested myself, but didn't have the circumstances to go see the film in theaters.  I read the novelization and the prequel novel, 'After Earth: A Perfect Beast', instead.  (Forgive the preface, but I wanted to at least give some insight on my potential bias.)<br /><br />I enjoyed the books (they're better than the movie, more detailed by far), and eagerly looked forward to seeing the movie.  Here's the deal: this is a fairly short film, so not a lot of plot is involved.  Most of the film is Will Smith and Jaden Smith in a man-vs.-nature situation in a post-apocalyptic Earth.  What you see in the previews is more or less what you get, but it's not entirely that simple.<br /><br />The biggest plus in this film is Will Smith's nuanced performance.  For fathers, I think this film has a lot of heart.  Its strongest point is the reconnecting of father and son through this crisis situation they're experiencing (crash-landing on Earth, etc.).  There are actually very few people in this movie, to be honest.  The plot is very centered on Cypher (Will Smith) and Kitai (Jaden Smith), but in itself, that is actually quite compelling.<br /><br />Jaden Smith is actually pretty good at many places throughout this film, and falls flat in others.  He's kind of the weak link, but the good thing is that Will Smith's experience is there to keep the film grounded and counterbalance him.  Jaden is not horrible, but doesn't quite hit all the notes perfectly.  Another factor is that the script doesn't always give us enough of a grasp of his perspective.  I think they needed to add more to really draw us into how he feels, as it's key to understanding the character's motivations (a desire to please his father/self-blame over a past tragedy/trauma and anger resulting from same tragedy).<br /><br />The only other major downside of the film is that it fails to really fill in the story enough to help the audience see thatthere is a much larger world here than what we saw in the film.  I would have liked to have seen more of this world, how it's run, who the aliens were (the Skrel), why they sent the Ursa, and maybe why they didn't just send a thousand of them and wipe out humanity, for instance.<br /><br />It's a good film, but maybe it won't appeal to what people were hoping for.  There isn't a lot of humor, and not that much action, but there is some good (mostly subtle) emotion throughout, along with interesting themes--the beauty of planet Earth, overcoming one's fears, father connecting with son, coping with loss of a child, and coming-of-age as a young man.<br /><br />I know it won't be a popular thing to say that I like it, and that more people should've checked it out, but...I like it.  I certainly wasn't blown away, but I was pleased with the film and I would've liked to see where this story was going.  I think it's better than people will give it credit for.  It's not going in the same direction as a lot of the big blockbusters with massive destruction, explosions, sometimes excessive violence and language and objectification of women, etc.<br /><br />It's also unique in having a cast that largely consists of people of color, but not prejudiced in that it shows this is a diverse world with not just one or two colors of people, and I like that in a movie.  (Some good assists towards the beginning of the film from two very good actors whose names escape me...)<br /><br />So...I say, check it out.  It's at least worth a rental, but I own it, and am already trying to watch it again after the first viewing.  After Earth is alright with me.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Recommend to all Stephen King fans. I loved the book. My husband was an alcoholic and member of AA for years. All references were correct. Anyone who is trying to decide to read or not....take the leap, read it.

B002HJ9PTO|4.0|This is one of the cheapest lapel microphones available. The sound quality is, surprisingly, quite good. Of course, the biggest advantage of any lavalier microphone is the ability to maintain the same sound level regardless of your position relative to the camera, and the Audio-Technica ATR-3350 also provides that.<br /><br />The microphone doesn't seem sturdy, but I used the previous model (ATR-35), which is very similar to this one, for 6 years before it finally fell apart. Compared to ATR-35, this newer model has a stereo connector which is very good because modern cameras, especially DSLRs, usually record only the left channel if your microphone has a mono connector.<br /><br />Like the older model, this microphone uses LR44/SR44 batteries. It still has no power indicator and if you forget to turn it off, it will completely drain the battery overnight. That's why I usually carry a pair of spare batteries in my camera bag. But I'd really like to see a LED power indicator. That's why I give this mic only 4 stars.
B008D28HYS|4.0|I'm enjoying this game quite a bit. Each puzzle is easy to start and progressively gets harder which is nice...you get a real feel for the game and not easily frustrated with it.

B00DQVST76|1.0|I could not believe how stupid and boring this concert was. The music was slow, she was lip syncing, the song selection was not up to par.  It was just all around a huge bore!  Total waste of $16.00!!
B00BT70J7M|1.0|I'm amazed at how many people are impressed by Kaufmann's \\"can belto\\" attempt at singing. Obviously, these are people with little experience with opera or singers. Kaufmann conquers nothing and his thick, unwieldy voice (either bellowed or crooned) makes hsort work of Verdi as he has with Wagner. Don't waste your time or money. If you're one of those who is so thrilled with this junk, try listening to a REAL Verdi tenor, Carlo Bergonzi, Richard Tucker, or Giovanni Martinelli. Now THOSE are singers.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|The cinematography was a dud; half the time I didn't know what all that over-the-top glitz was for--it really was much ado about nothing. The music was a gross deviation from being period correct--really..techno in the Roaring 20's?!? The soundtrack was a favor to Beyonce and Jay-Z. I think the producer owed them money and instead put their music as \\"paid in full\\". The music totally bastardized the era. I'm appalled at Leonardo's decision to star in this monstrosity, which makes me think that he had a mortgage payment due and needed the money. Don't get me wrong: his acting shines on the screen and you're kinda left longing to see more of him, than the voyeur Toby Macguire. What was his function again? The woman playing Daisy--I was so not impressed with her performance. She was lackluster.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor: wait till this is free on-demand and save your pennies for a real flick.

B00DJZR4A2|5.0|Piano, vocals, bass & drums.  Think \\"Elton John\\" - the 1st album.  Think \\"Tumbleweed Connection\\" - the 2nd album.  Even think \\"Madman Across the Water\\" - third album.  This is a brilliant return to form for Sir Elton.  The lyrics by Taupin couldn't be any more poignant, heartfelt or emotional - along with the music.  These two have been writing for the better part of 4 decades - together - it shows on this collection.  Yes, it's \\"pop\\" produced - this is the 2010's for God's sake - but most of the material is Elton, a bass player and a percussionist - with a little embellishment along the way.  The way it should be.  Welcome back Sir Elton!

B003FZ9AR6|5.0|Liev Schreiber directed and wrote the screenplay conversion of Everything Is Illuminated with the confidence of an accomplished director. His use of insight and artistic ability is beyond words. From genius camera angles that seem to capture every meaningful expression of emotion, to the seemingly effortless collaboration of the characters, I had a feeling that I was experiencing everything with the characters, and was drawn into this story, which left me feeling like I had just traveled abroad with old friends. This picture is an instant favorite for me. I was surprised by Eugene Hutz acting ability. Perfection!

Since I'm also a Christian, like Dr. Chapman, I really liked his recommendations-so much that I've asked my boyfriend to read the book, also.  I believe that communication is the key thing in romantic relationships, and Dr. Chapman helps you understand how to really communicate love to your spouse.  I highly recommend this book.

B00DHNBPA6|5.0|** spoilers **<br /><br />Mia is a heroin addict dealing with the aftermath of her mother's death. She goes to an old cabin her family owns with her friends and her brother to get her through withdrawal and get clean, but the place has been broken into and defaced. They clean up as best they can and find a weird book wrapped in a trash bag and barbed wire. Eric decides to disregard every single warning, open it, and read it out loud. Of course it releases demons that possess them to torment and eventually kill them. Can they band together to defeat the evil or will all their souls burn in hell?<br /><br />I usually hate remakes with the fire of a thousand suns. The filmmakers usually dumb down what made the film great in the first place. I actually enjoyed Evil Dead much more than the original. I understand why the original is so well liked, but it's so boring and badly acted. The remake breathes new life into the story, giving a well fleshed out plot and characters with actual personalities and relationships. The relationships are what kept them there in the cabin even after dead cats and evil books are discovered when any sane person would have left. They all want Mia to get clean and want to stay at any cost because her life is at risk if she stays on drugs. The sibling relationship comes into play when David can easily end the whole thing by simply killing Mia. He opts to kill her and then bring her back, risking and eventually sacrificing his own life so she can live. It also makes it all the more meaningful when the demon chooses to appear as whoever they are possessing, in pain and bewildered at their mutilations, to manipulate their loved ones.<br /><br />Evil Dead is a fun, scary film. There are a few jump scares at the beginning to set the mood, but the real suspense is built later. One of my favorite scenes is where Olivia is possessed and mutilating herself behind a shower curtain. You know exactly what she's doing, but as Eric draws nearer and nearer, you dread actually seeing it and being confronted by the Deadite. The humor isn't the same as the previous films. It's dark and not as overt, but it still had a me laughing out loud quite a few times. I also love this scene because at the midnight showing I went to, the guy next to me said it was the grossest thing he'd ever seen. I liked that the infamous tree rape scene was kept, but made into something actually horrifying and disgusting. The original scene is downright comical and the new one is extremely uncomfortable to watch. Possession is basically a type of rape where an entity enters the body and controls it against the person's will.<br /><br />The film is an allegory for addiction. Mia and her friends come together for her to conquer her addiction. At first, they force her to stay when she clearly can't handle the withdrawals. Then she is possessed after being raped by her evil doppelganger and turns unrecognizable. Addiction causes people to turn into monsters and hurt the people around them. The possession in the film is communicable and is passed through bites, vomit, and injuries. It shows how toxic addiction can be to loved ones. After her brother kills and revives her, she is left alone to confront her evil doppelganger. Mia is the only one that can conquer her addiction. Her friends and family can do as much as they can, but it won't do any good if Mia isn't willing to change and really work to get better.<br /><br />Evil Dead is a blast to watch. I love the mixture of dark humor, gross gore, and suspense. The only scene I thought was too over the top was when it started raining blood. After a while, everything is oversaturated with it and it ceases to mean anything. Other than that, it was an enjoyable, well balanced film.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I couldn't put the book down it was sad but inspires th  average person to remember they can do what some can to appreciate everything you have and never loose sight of who you are  because in the end we don't choose what happens it chooses us

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King doesn't miss a beat. This book had me at the first page and I couldn't put it down.  Also looking forward to \\"'re reading \\" The  Shining again. Great characters and life lessons will be in the realm of personal favorite's  on my book shelf or in my kindle
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|I love this album..he mixed it up and I can honestly say I can't pick just one favorite :) love the whole thing
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great graphics, great puzzles, can't wait for the second one, nothing more to say other than buy this game now
B008LCRAC0|5.0|Of course, Seinfeld!  It may be all over the TV on reruns--but we still like to watch it at will.  Buying the DVD's allow us to do just that!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|This game is so boring. It doesn't progress at all. It mostly just wants you to buy. Only reason I gave it two stars is beacuse the graphics are pretty.
1451627289|5.0|I don't agree with his theory but the book is a good read. It's interesting that he go's back to Derry in 1958 and one gets re-acquainted with some of the kids from,&#34;It.&#34;
B008RKGFTK|3.0|I read &#34;American Gigolo&#34; and saw the movie back when both originally came out (1980).  33 years later, it's fun to watch Richard Gere in one of his early leading man roles, but the film is dated and the ending is so contrived as to be not only implausible, but also laughable.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved that the author didn't give everything away at the beginning and there were lots of twists and turns. I also like the fact that the characters are real people with real problems in difficult situations. I immediately downloaded another book by this author after reading this one
B003QKR9UK|5.0|Woah, 5 stars, this is a good DCU movie. and Ive seen them all, and all the batman tv shows as a kid. This was a great show, great performance by ALL voice actors. Good deal.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The device was able to be setup and active within a few minutes, I was unsure how easy it would be since it has no interface to connect to secure wifi.  Instead I just plugged it in, went to the google link as directed, typed in my wifi password and moments later I was chromecasting.  I docked a star off because it hasn't been as nifty as presented, no issues with netflix which has been clearly supported and developed from the start.  My issue was chromecasting browser stream, for instance watching a tv episode on hulu was failing to stream correctly or at all in full screen.  It would somewhat work in windowed mode but I could just use a hdmi cable to the computer if I wanted that.  There is potential as they tweak and improve the device though so maybe it will be updated and fixed (either driver or browser issue improvements) to get a 5 star bump.<br /><br />I will say that if you just want an easy way to watch netflix on a non \\"smart\\" hdtv this is a fantastic method.  The pricetag is nice and the setup couldn't be any more simple, the marketing has somewhat hidden the fact that it uses usb power though so be mindful of that.  All images tend to just be of the dongle without power cable attached, it can pull power from a tv usb port or if your model is older simply use the included wall power adapter, the usb power cable is moderately long so it shouldn't be an issue.  The instructions recommend using wall power though I have only used the tv usb port (which is fine).  I am guessing this recommendation for wall power is because usb power has the potential to vary for instance a laptop with many power pulling devices might not have enough \\"juice' to properly power another device.<br /><br />Note: another perk of the device is you can get multiple chromecasts for different rooms/tvs and label them to what they are.  Hijacking can happen though, I used it to interrupt my fiance streaming netflix with a youtube love song because I started a second chromecast on a different computer ;)<br /><br />Summary:<br />it's cheap, simple to use and works with pretty much any tablet,phone,laptop or desktop.  As long as they have an app IOS or Android or google chrome they should work.  You just click a button on chrome and it shoots over to the screen.erent computer ;)<br /><br />Summary:<br />it's cheap, simple to use and works with pretty much any tablet,phone,laptop or desktop.

B0080QOLCE|4.0|This movie came out along with a very similar movie by the title Disturbing Behavior.  This was the far better movie, both commercially and critically.  The Faculty is highly derivative of the 50's \\"Red Scare\\" movies, particularly Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  It also borrows very heavily--particularly in creature effects--from John Carpenter's The Thing.  Nevertheless, it does so more so as an homage, and it in no way feels cheap or a rip off.  From this standpoint it does rip off Wes Craven's Scream, with characters directly referencing horror movies as a way to understand the problems they are facing in their own movie.  Nonetheless, the movie is great fun and a pretty good horror movie.<br /><br />The Blu-ray treatment is quite good.  My main complaint is that there is definitely some digital enhancement going on here, particularly with edge enhancement.  It never completely oversteps its bounds, but it is definitely there.  Otherwise the picture looks very strong on all fronts.  The audio has the original theatrical Dolby and DTS tracks, as well as a stereo downmix for headphone wearers.  The extras are mostly fluff.  All in all, fans of the movie will really enjoy this Blu-ray.  It is a very solid disc.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Just get it, it won't let you down. I rely on it more than I do my cell phone alarm.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|fun playing the different levels more challenging than original angry birds, love star wars and space angry birds too. Love it
B00280LYIC|5.0|Five star amazing<br />I love the movie also  it is interest I love it so much I think I will read the second one
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game I am really enjoying playing it. Best of both worlds with hidden object and puzzles. Highly rated, I would have paid for this one.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Keeps you guessing. Just as you think you have it all figured out she changes your mind and gives you more information. Only at the end do you realize your first assumption was correct! A great read! Loved it!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is full of fun and keeps your brain ticking over to make it interest ing and different every time you play
1476727651|4.0|I was very impressed by Stephen King's latest book, \\"Doctor Sleep,\\" even though I am not usually a fan of either horror novels or Mr. King. A friend mentioned it was a sequel to \\"The Shining,\\" and I read an excerpt which had me hooked immediately. Now, I've never read \\"The Shining,\\" nor seen the movie, but it's hard to live in this society without a few references sinking in--such as \\"Here's Johnny!\\", etc. I cracked the book open expecting to be overwhelmed by disgust and horror!<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILER!!! BE WARNED!!!!! But what I found was that the MOST horrible thing was that the evil-doers were banal--ordinary--no epic, Hollywood-type villains here. It was their very matter-of-fact attitude toward the horrors they visited on the helpless that makes the reader feel the depth of their evil. This was an excellent read with a terrific resolution and I highly recommend it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This novel was amazing. Not since Under the Dome was released had I read something I couldn't bear to put down.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I love all the Sigma novels. They would make great non stop action no use! This is really good read.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This show has it all. Incredible acting from Cumberbatch and Freeman are an incredible duo of actors. The writing is superb and will keep you on the edge of your seat at all times. Definitely worth watching and bring the don't forget the popcorn!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing story plot and very twisting at the end. I recommend it to anyone and everyone! I like how it was suspenseful throughout the whole book.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Do I need to tell you that this is about as perfect as a Masterpiece series can be.  What is incredible is the script is original.  What a mind to create this story.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved reading this book. My daughter had told me how good it was while she was reading it.  Her words were \\" it sucks you in \\".  She was right.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|\\"The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but Time and chance happen to all,\\" so says the Teacher in Ecclesiastes. Outliers seems to verify this aged wisdom. I liked seeing it explained better than the Teacher did by Mr. Gladwell. It was less than 200 pages, kept a nice pace, made its point, & finished. Recommended for those who've thought there's more to success than meets the eye.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Maybe a bit of both. It seems to me that at least a couple of games from Gameloft (the ones I play) and I'm sure more than that are fixed so they malfunction but always in their favor. Its not only frustrating, it's right down disgusting. The only reason I'm still playing is that I already sank quite a bit of money into them and I'm not about to quit. However, I'm doing my very best to not give them any more of my money.
0679809015|5.0|I bought this for the price and was certainly surprised at the quality. I thought it was very nice and will give lots of fun and enjoyment to the child I purchased it for. Thanks.
B00687PWQG|5.0|Giamatti is great. Acting is great. Set design and direction is great. Really gives you the look and feel of Boston on the eve of Revolution. Puts you into the drama of the period like no history textbook does. I've shown parts of it to my American History classes.
B009FXIICK|1.0|Another recycled app. There are so many apps I should not be concerned with the free app being one the offered months ago/last year. BS

B000L9EKL0|5.0|Gene Hackman  and Owen Wilson are great in this movie The men play there rolls very well and its a true story
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great game with online and single player options. Also I love upgrading my gear. Lots of action. Can't wait for the next game in the series
B008OOYALE|1.0|I'd give it a half star or none if it would let me, but I was incredibly annoyed and frankly mad that this game just decides that it can take all your dragons away. I let my son use my kindle when he went to his grandmother's for the weekend (he is 4 so I have a free time account for him that he can not exit w/o the password into my things). I entered the game and all but the Dragon egg I had incubating was gone. I didn't spend too more then a few dollars on it to speed up the slow process of getting going. Everything was exactly how I left it except that I had no dragons in their habitats at all... total waste of the very long time it took to build anything up... wouldn't suggest this game to anyone if two days is all it takes to lose all your progress.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is an awesome game!! It's super fun and kind of challenging. I would recommend this to anyone who likes these types of games.
B002RI9UE0|5.0|The  President naturally should have a dedication towards weaving with the society - creating a lot of inspiration in men's mind. At first I was wondering how he could prefer to share his time in the form of a Hi-Tech e-book! I certainly enjoyed reading which has an excellent description of his family and it has a big value too.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|If you are a person who likes loads of imagery and description, this will be a great read for you.  Personally, I hated it.  I gave this book two stars because the author does create some beautiful scenes, but that's really all there is to this book.  The main characters are completely flat and nearly impossible to relate to.  The story lumbers along with very little action.  Important events are glossed over.  The death of a character is described in less than a paragraph, while you read pages about what a particular circus tent looked like. By the end, I was just reading to see how it all wrapped up, not because I actually cared about the characters.  This book had an excellent premise, but missed the mark.
B006ISJQ1W|3.0|This film works in ways that aren't readily apparent.<br /><br />Not a big fan of Depp's (great in Chocolat), but what he does well here is register the lunacy of the situation, topped with rum, and the dilemma: whether to take the high road or the low when the difference in heights isn't that great, as his boss points out. Depp also conveys well his character's understanding that this stint in Puerto Rico is destined to become One of Those Experiences.<br /><br />The real strength of the film, though, is in the newsroom scenes, especially the performances of Richard Jenkins, as the editor, and, most especially, Michael Rispoli (is it?) as the photographer. Rispoli's performance is the best newshound portrayal I've ever seen (shades of Kevin Costner playing the laborer in that Boston flick); (for whatever reason getting the newsman right has proven illusive to many a fine actor. Crowe was awful, Streep pretty good, and Marisa Tomei very good); and Jenkins' is second-best. He is especially good when nailing Depp as being hungover, his first day on the job.<br /><br />Solid too is Eckhart. He's the bad guy, but he's not evil. He's just another capitalist, this one smart enough to work in the Caribbean and with an above-average beautiful woman on his arm.<br /><br />As for Ribisi's performance, it is as usual just that, and whether you like his performances or not will determine whether you like this one.
1439190275|5.0|This isn't the same Atkins I was on back in the 70s.  I'm really glad that there are now mandatory vegetables included.  This diet is very close to a diet from my chiropractor that costs $1500 to join and about $90/week for their powdered protein.
B00571F26Y|4.0|It makes good sense.  I thought it a little word-y at first, but, by the time I'd read about a third of it...I couldn't put it down.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has become one of my favorite sci/fiction writer since Raymond E.Feist and R.A Savatore. All of his books are very addictive and always surprise the readers with his creativity with the &#34;magic/system&#34; and how he unfolded the story. I would rate this book higher than Rithmatist. Looking forward to the release of his 2nd book - Stormlight trilogy - Words of Radiance in April 2014!
B00E34A9FU|5.0|it was 104 degrees and the band was hot in many ways  this show beats that crazed barton hall show by a mile  the playin in the band will melt your face
B004DM1ZQY|3.0|I like the Backgammon app, but there are a few things that are quite annoying.  For example, when you roll doubles, you have no option to move two pieces at a time.  You have to make 4 separate moves, with each move involving at least 2 clicks.  that's 8 clicks for one move, which is too many.  Also, I started playing against the computer, with the difficulty set at 2.  Even though it's not the lowest setting, the computer played like a complete novice, passing up obvious moves in favor of idiotic ones.  Of course, this can be solved by simply setting the game at a higher difficulty, but it was still annoying.  I'll be looking for fixes in updates, so I haven't given up hope that this could become an outstanding app.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil has done another masterful job of taking a simple story and building it into a tapestry of dark and light. Wonderful!
0307592731|5.0|This book is a wonderful exploration of hiking, grief, and moving forward (literally and figuratively).  After reading it, I became an avid winter hiker and have found inspiration from Cheryl's journey.  There are moments, when I'm learning something on the trail (like always know the easiest path to your campsite in the dark), that I think of what she went through, and I'm able to laugh at myself and move on.  It's a great read - highly recommend.
B00DK9FNLY|1.0|I am really getting tired of developers who think that the privacy of their customers is something to exploit. Developer: you have no right to my location for an app like this. And your use of multiple embedded tracking and spyware programs without full disclosure is the deal breaker for me. I don't even care about your game at any price at this point. Even ONE star is one star too many. Developers like you need to KNOCK IT OFF ALREADY! Stop treating your customers like dirt!
B00CEZJT2E|2.0|This device looks great and I was excited to use it.  Problem is it will only charge my s4 once.  I bought this one hoping it would charge it at least twice.  Not what I hoped for.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a great book that actually prove your thoughts create your reality by giving you assignments - actions that you take to prove this to yourself.  This book can change your life.
B001HVZO9S|5.0|My 6 yr old grandson has taken a interest in the drums. So his mother was wanting him to watch this movie. I found it on here. I received it, and it was in excellent shape. Thank you
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Interesting book.  4 stars if you have, or had, a teenage boy.  The author really nails the teenage attitude.  A crime/lawyer book with a different perspective.
B00454U1NS|5.0|All I can say is this lady has got talent. I'm 50 and I love me some Pink. My daughter's were surprised at my different love for music. But she is raw and had a beautiful voice, can't help but like her. WTG woman of the year!
B006PIXKVW|5.0|A very touching and heartwarming film.the little princess told the best stories to the others girls. Amazing imagination! Very magical.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|Toy Defense 2 is a great game. Good to help pass time or if you are just relaxing around the house. This is a very fun game .
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Zombies sure are popular these days - movies, books, tv series. The beauty of this book is its unique style. Written as an anthology of postwar interviews, it tells the human story of a great conflict, an unprecedented apocalypse, in a voice that has the calmness of a history text. This is not high action or adventure, there are few dramatic moments, but the book is engrossing, detailed and intriguing. If you loved the movie, it means nothing for how you might feel about the book.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Now You See Me was a very entertaining, fresh film. It's not deep in plot, but it's not supposed to be.  It has a Robin Hood-feel to it, with the good stealing from the corrupt to give back to the poor.  Some of the twists were expected; however, their execution isn't what I was expecting to happen.  Overall, a great movie to watch with the family.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I've always loved Follett's books but especially enjoyed this one. Everything in this book still impacts us today and raises very interesting discussions including why the American Revolution had such a different outcome than all the others....including those going on today.  Can't wait to start the next book!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|At first, I Dredded (ha, ha) the thought of this movie.  After the Sly verison, I thought this was going to be a big dud.  But this was dark and more \\"believable\\", with no lame attempts at trying to be funny, just the gritty underbelly of a society trying to keep from going completely into chaos.  For some reason, I really like the Judge Anderson character, there just something about her, maybe because she was the underdog, or maybe she used her psychic powers on me.  And I kind of wonder if Solyent Green is on the lunch menu....
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|He never fails to deliver the best!!! I couldn't put the book down. Highly recommend if you love Stephen King!
B005QYKD4I|1.0|Did any of this make any sense?  An army of decepticons hidden on the moon moving things around?  Where were they in the previous movies?  Why the heck did they wait 50 years to do anything?  Who shot down Sentenial?  Just plot hole after plot hole.  In fact that is where this movie belongs, in a deep hole, like the Laurentian Abyss, where the deactivated decepticons ended up in the last movie.  Which brings up another hole- The decepticons seemed to take damage from standard human weapons, which means the decepticons could have been scrapped for their metal content.  Also, who brought Megatron back to life?  Could that be done with Sentinal?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is challenging and fun at the same time but it is hard to control but I'll get used to it
B002WY65VU|5.0|Eisenberg and Harrelson make an awesome screen team. The screenplay is witty and charming. The surprise cameo is hilarious. Breslin and Stone are great as well. The concept is wonderful. It's unlike any horror film or comedy film I've seen! Highly Recommended!
B003F48E4W|4.0|This movie does pretty good for it's time frame. The acting is fairly well, and it's relatively quirky. I wouldn't call this a full-on horror movie, but it's got a decent story, and it's a fun watch.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Can some one help me what does it mean if it say login failed does it me I put something in wrong or what please help me
B0035HKWLW|4.0|I enjoy this movie every time I watch it and it never gets old. Every Jim Carrey fan should watch this.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I love this man! He came back from his addictions, is a great family man and best actor so believable in anything he does. He's worth supporting! We'll buy this movie for our colection. We support good guys off the screen not Miley Cyrus types. I'm not supporting your lifestyle that's hurting you and those around you. Once you put in the time and get it together we'll be there.

B00CIVLZ3U|5.0|Firstly, I do like all the authors books. Again it is a relief not to have my enjoyment of the story hindered by poor editing - I was able to remain in the story. An interesting take on the corrupting influence of total power and our hope for heros
B000I8G5GW|5.0|The Briidge on the River Kwai has to be one of the classic all time favorite war time movies that I have watched numerous times. Everytime I watch it, I still enjoy the movie.
B001EC0ONG|4.0|Great movie, exciting, Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford are great together, just good entertainment. Nice &#34;finale&#34; to the series I watched as a youngster and remember vaguely.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I have watched the Goonies before and it still is enjoyable. To see Sean Austin when he was young was enjoyable.
B0026NBZDU|4.0|Excellent &#34;twists&#34; in the story .... kept me reading and rooting for the ending I wanted.  The happenings in the asylum were overdone and I kept wanting the author to hurry and move through that part.  However, this part is certainly based on facts that are appalling and worth the reader's awareness.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Fast and furious fromI beginning to end.  Really enjoyed the characters and the cinemetography.  I will definitely buy this movie.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|Warning - contains spoilers.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />My biggest problem with this book was the characters that felt stagnant and cliched.<br /><br />David, the POV character, is a male teenage know-it-all who jumps in to an established, more experienced group to tell them how they're doin' it wrong, highlighted by multiple distinct occasions where his flashes of insight is responsible for pulling team members out of danger.  The know-it-all status is mitigated only slightly by David having a compelling reason to dedicate himself to profiling \\"Epics\\" and learning about their abilities and weaknesses - still doesn't make it feel any more believable for him to keep saving people who've been doing this whole schtick a lot longer than he has.<br /><br />Megan (the obligatory love interest) is a bit older than David, competent in weaponry and all manner of mayhem-producing tactics, sarcastic, and just barely out of reach for him.  Her antagonism toward him felt forced in the beginning and over-the-top compared to her explanation later.  When you take into account her status as an undercover Epic herself, it makes absolutely no sense.  If she wanted to disrupt the team's plans, hostility toward the newest member isn't exactly going to cut it, especially when everyone else takes to him pretty quickly.  I just can't find a good explanation or justification for her being there, going along with the other assassinations, only objecting to David's plans, and not even discussing why until past the middle of the book, except to give David someone clever, gorgeous and standoffish to crush on.<br /><br />With that being said, it was a fast and fun read.  The story moves along fast enough that it's easy to overlook the flaws and just concentrate on the plot, at least until it's done.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I love the story, scenery, and the customs.  We can't wait to see the fourth season.  We have both been to England  and this story has made us to want to return.

B008J05EL8|1.0|This really looked promising. Should have read the reviews first. This is a RIPOFF. DON'T BUY THIS ONE!!!!  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is a great app for being free. Graphics are good and it plays very well with no slowing. Nice!
B002W7J3SO|5.0|I my opinion this is one of the best Cary Grant moves. And Hitchcock direction was awesome. This is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies.  Great plot and movie locations. A must watch.
B00452VF4O|5.0|I read the entire trilogy and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in historical fiction and the medieval period in particular. The first and third books are better than the second but it is worth it to read them all in order. Be prepared to form strong relationships with the main characters. . .and to possibly have your heart broken.
B004I3U7US|5.0|Initial impression with this release was one of a slight disappointment. The backing seemed a bit too sparse & uninteresting & there was something slightly unappealing about Anna's voice....a little bit too upper class perhaps? So it lay dormant for many months and then after a recently concentrated re-listening have to say that it is an amazing & powerful album. Anna really has a strong voice plus coupled with some brilliant guitar sounds then now believe this to be something special. Things start though without a grand fanfare 'Rider To The Sea', 'No More Words' (it is growing), and it is via 'Desire' which starts to demonstrate some flair & so far is standout track. Next 'Suzanne & I' for me is not the strongest (though many seem to like this one even enough to be the 3rd vinyl 7\\" A side release off the album)...but then emerges 'First We Kiss' which is really brilliant. An emotional tour de force with some nice orchestral sounds over the indie style solid backing as Anna lets out her emotion & sings magnificently \\"a face against the window our lips touch no more\\". 'The Devil' more deliberate & slow continues this high \\"fall for me\\". Amazingly with few words in this number that it can put such strong feelings across. The interesting circular guitar strums coupled to the husky vocal creates an arresting beautiful melancholy before hitting a climax....astonishing piece. 'Blackout' (have this on 7\\") continues the high, another passionate & beautiful delivery - initially my preferred until the previous two snuck through. 'I'll Be Your Man' with some spaghetti-western guitar & 'Morning Light' with the harmonium as the key element both continue this atmospheric vibe. Finally 'Love Won't Be Leaving' with an interesting guitar percussion break ends the LP on a high. Passionate raw sensual songs of love falling somewhere between God & the Devil.

B001KZG99A|3.0|I love the newer SUperman and batman movies but this didn't really hold my interest.  Gwyneth was good.  It didn't have a deep back story
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book makes it clear and easy to get your file in the proper format to upload for Kindle books.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can sit for hours and scan the different boards.  It is way more simple to navigate than other media apps. and any subject I choose is right at my finger tips.
B00F2362IE|5.0|I'm writing this for my 8 &amp; 10 yr old grandchildren. They LOVE this game! Best game ever!  So much fun.  Worth 3.99.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|love this game.  Played it with friends, we had a great time.  This game is one that can be played in about 30 minutes or less depending on the number of players.
B005PK553C|5.0|Enjoyed the new teasers for the Coven season three, so I went to investigate the previous seasons. On Prime I got to watch all of season one for free. There infamous plan worked I am hooked.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This show is addictive and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It is a great way to kill a weekend.... because you just cant stop watching!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|fire breathing pink Mini robot Cthulu. Just start making stuff up, just like the original game. Dont forget to have fun.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|always looking forward to what will unfold next.<br /><br />The characters are authentic and yet another case of how in a snap second everything an event can change for oneself and those connected with the action.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I loved this book!  It is rare to find a romance book written from the male point of view.  The author nailed it with a male's way of thinking.  His explanation of the word &#34;fine&#34; when asking a woman how she is cracked me up, because it was so right on.  I am still laughing when I think of some of the other references made in the book about how a males mind works.  That being said, this book had a good story line with interesting characters, not just the main ones either.  I am looking forward to the follow up books.  The only thing that I found a little lacking in the book, was Kate's old boyfriend.  I really felt sorry for him, as he was the one that helped to put her through college and stayed, only to have her out grow him.  I kind of felt like he didnt get the credit that he deservered.  Did I love Drew- yes in a male pig way.  Would I want a Drew- heck yah!  Buy the book and be prepared to read it from start to finish.  Enjoy!
B0058VW36U|1.0|I DOWNLOADED THIS AS A REQUEST OF MY 4 YEAR OLD BOY, THE GAME NEVER STARTED, IT KEPT BRINGING ME BACK TO KINDLE 'S MAIN MENU. I HAD TO ERASED IT, AND GOT MY MONEY BACK.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Has decent control layout, with easy to use combat mechanics. If you like team fortress 2 then you will enjoy this game. Downside is there are a lot of small game sizes. Great game.
B0040I09RM|4.0|Season one was good. Action packed kids or me wanting more. Story line is good. JAXS Is HOTTTTT.....good show to watch..
B000669GAI|5.0|How could ANYONE not like this collection!? It contains just about every Pearl Jam classic you could possibly think of!!! \\"Even Flow\\",\\"Black\\",\\"Jeremy\\",\\"Alive\\",\\"Daughter\\",\\"Better Man\\",\\"Last Kiss\\"...even some of the more obscure songs like \\"State Of Love And Trust\\",\\"Breathe\\",\\"Go\\",\\"Dissident\\",\\"Immortality\\"(which is my personal fav PJ song),\\"Off He Goes\\"...and so much more!!! If I could change anything about this collection,it would be to have the song \\"Rats\\"(my second personal fav PJ tune) included on here along with the rest of these great songs. But hey...thats really no problem. I'll just pop in my 'VS.' Cd and listen to it lol Overall,if you love Pearl Jam as much as I do...then you NEED TO BUY THIS COLLECTION!!!
B008OOYALE|3.0|This is a great game and I would recommend this, especially for patient people, possibly even those who get stressed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This horse game is awesome. I love using it. Me and my friends go and cost each other's horses all the time.
B00F4KGJRO|5.0|I can't help loving everything Alan Jackson does but this is a refreshing country bluegrass sound and I am really enjoying playing it to death.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|Great book by a great author. Easily as good as any of the game of thrones books or king killer chronicles.  I can't wait to read the conclusion.
B00AYPXG5W|5.0|I love this movie.  I have seen it 4 - 5 times.  Robert Patrick, one of the lead actors, is an excellent actor and it was a pleasure to see James Garner.  The cast was well-chosen and there was some excellent acting.  The story kept me on the edge of my seat, waiting to discover what really happened to the missing person.  Excellent script writing.  I recommend this movie for those who enjoy mystery and stories dealing with alien abduction.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|I love this game it's awesome keeps me relax and helps me think I would recommend this to everyone love this game seriously can't get enough of it
B007ZXK08C|3.0|This book was a real page turner but overall not as enjoyable as it should have been. The main reason for this is that I found both main characters to be beyond the realm of possibility and the ending to be highly unsuitable. To me this was a very depressing and fanciful ending. this Gone Girl is too far GONE!
B008476HBM|4.0|I love the story but the wording became a little boreing. I don't read very well, and it was hard to follow. Is there a version where the wording is a little more modern?
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Because it is super fun and it is like subway surfer. You can run, jump and slide around obstacles. It's cool to be a minion.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|This game needs more health, I mean it would be ok if your character regenerated health but sadly no, you don't regenerate health, so please fix it in the up coming update. But other than that this is a good game. Oh and also don't think about the thing about the health to much because it's not that big a deal but I still really want it to be fixed because I keep dieing.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I have uno with friends on phone so got this on kindle and i cant play it it keeps saying content not owned very mad cause  i spent money on this and cant play. Very disappointed in this and aggravated cause cant play and lost money.  If something is on the store u should be able to buy it and USE it.  Maybe these things should be checked before allowing to post
B00BB8VSXS|2.0|There is a total disconnect between the description of this movie and what it contains.<br />Whoever is responsible for the editing of the description should review the situation.
B0040HO16S|5.0|I love everything about this series.  It is filled with charm and wit.  Always includes a wonderful lesson to be learned. The simple things of life are appreciated.  I love how they say Mar and Par for Ma and Pa.  A show I can feel great about watching with the entire family.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love the characters and the constant plot twists in this series.  I've become invested in the lives of both the aristocrats and the servants.
B009IF6U98|1.0|To say it is a sophomoric movie is too high praise. If you are beyond middle school age, don't bother.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I love musicals and this production is outstanding.  Well worth the time invested.  Hope they keep up the good work,
B000I8HIR2|5.0|I personally love this movie. I am a huge fan of the Silent Hill series and this movie is wonderful in my opinion. I know that this movie isn't for everybody,but I'd tell anybody to give it a try.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Couldn't get past 45 minutes.  So glad we didn't spend time or more money to go to a theater for this one.
B00ESF285S|5.0|This book is such a great read. Whether reading to a child or for yourself. As a soon to be college grad, I still love reading this book. It has such a good message for everyone!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Probably one of my favorite movies of all time. I could never get tired of watching this movie, it's always fantastic!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very fun game that reminds me of Nancy drew games with puzzles that are challenging but not impossible to solve.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Although the ending of every episode is so predicting, meaning they win every time, I still enjoy this show a lot.
B004T32SOK|3.0|I have been using box for a few months now and haven't had any issues until today. I cant log in and keep getting a &quot;check your network connection&quot; message when I am already connected. Please provide update to solve this issue. thanks.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This was a wonderful series.  Very addictive, and I can hardly wait for the next season.  Wonderful characters and story content.
B004811PMO|3.0|Based on the opening credits alone, the only version you can download is the Todd-AO one.  I was looking forward to watching the Cinemascope version for a college theater class and instead I got what the other reviews promise to be a disappointment.  I wish both versions were available.  I feel like I was a victim of a bait and switch!
B0043URV5U|4.0|Brings back memories of the music I grew up with and desire to listen to again. Brings back those wild days of my youth.
B00F35B8F8|2.0|I am avid fan and this picture was not up to my standards. The quality of the picture was also pretty bad and that did not help.
B000093BDX|4.0|Brings back memories of the music I grew up with and desire to listen to again. Long live the summer time tunes.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very addicting. Even my 4 year old can do it. The children love it and so do I.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A Memory of Light is a perfectly crafted action packed epic fantasy novel that held my attention to the last word. The Last Battle against the Dark One and his forces which I had been anticipating for the past 14 books (15 if you count A New Spring) exceeded my expectations and I am still in complete awe of what I read. There were points in the series when I wished it would just wrap up but now it saddens me to think I will never read new adventures of the protagonists especially Mat who has become my favorite character.
B004GYY714|4.0|This is the best of the bunch in my opinion, mainly because the Tunein Radio app quickly takes you right to the station you want. No endless browsing to find your station.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|YOU WILL LOVE KELLY.  ALL  SONGS THAT WE HAVE HEARD OVER THE RADIO.  GREAT SOUND TRACK.  I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY.
0743289692|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali tells the story of her life - how she left war torn Somalia via Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and Kenya to come to the west. She holds nothing back: giving accounts of how her behavior brought shame to her family; and the fact that she lied to immigration officers in order to get refugee status in The Netherlands.<br /><br />It's very very interesting to hear how a (very conscientious) Somali Muslim woman views western society and welfare states.<br />I wish her stand on things could be shared by other third world immigrants who benefit from other countries' generosity. This book would be a very interesting read for them, but unfortunately I don't think they are the likely readers.<br /><br />The whole book is great, but I was especially captivated by chapter 12, her views on the welfare system. Here are a couple of excerpts:<br /><br />\\"I now understood roughly what a welfare state was. The able contributing to help the needy. I was able - I had arms and legs. I didn't want to keep taking and never give. I went first to the government employment bureau. The woman there registered me, but she said there wouldn't be much point in my working. I wanted to keep on with my Dutch classes and whatever I earned in sporadic temporary jobs would be subtracted from my welfare payment. I would be allowed to keep only the surplus, if there was one. I decided that I must try to work anyway.\\"<br /><br />\\"It irritated me now that Somalis who had lived in Holland for a long time complained that they were offered only lowly jobs. They wanted honorable professions: airline pilots, lawyers. When I pointed out that they had no qualifications for such work, their attitude was that everything was Holland's fault. The Europeans had colonized Somalia, which was why we all had no qualifications and why in this mess to begin with. I thought that was so clearly nonsense - we had torn ourselves apart, all on our own. It was the same sort of defensive arrogant attitude that I'd often seen among people from rural areas who emigrated to the city, whether Mogadishu or Nairobi. Here in Holland, the claim was always that we were held back by racism. Everybody seemed to be in a constant simmer of anger about how we were discriminated against because we were black. If a shopkeeper wouldn't bargain over the price of a t-shirt, Jasmine said there were special discount prices only for white people. She and Hasna told me they often didn't bother paying for buses. They just invented appointments in town, and if the refugee officer didn't give them a ticket, they said they were being racist. If you tell a Dutch person it's racist, he'll give you whatever you want, Hasna told me with satisfaction.\\"<br /><br />\\"I felt embarrassed and even let down by the way so many Somalis accepted welfare money, and then turned on the society that gave it to them.\\"<br /><br />/Sven O Mag.<br />[[ASIN:061575144X Beliefs: A Children's Guide to Religion]]en among people from rural areas who emigrated to the city, whether Mogadishu or Nairobi.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|I absolutely love this show!!! I can't think of anything I don't like about it.  I am only sad there are no other seasons available !
B0089LOG02|5.0|Vivian`s remarkable spirit is a joyful voice amongst adversity. These remarkable orphans continued to persevere under terrible conditions.  The living conditions, for most of these children,  were far worse than living in an orphanage.  Many of the families were looking for free labor without even having to provide decent room and board.  This is a remarkable read about a little known part of our history.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Very well written, you become addicted very quickly.  The actors are tremendous. In the middle of the second series and so far not disappointed at all.
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|Russell Crowe as a Mel Gibson character screaming Give me back my wife!  Crowe does it well, but the story seems a bit unbelievable as a middle aged teacher runs around the streets of Pittsburgh hiring drug dealers and forgers to assist in a jail breakout.  But the acting is good, the camera work good, but the plot just left me a bit incredulous.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Typically slow to start, as with all his great works, as he builds his characters and backgrounds. Once rolling, you find yourself reading well into the night, depriving yourself of much needed sleep. A must read for King fans.
B000RLKXEK|4.0|Pierce is at his finest here, with a script that does him justice. It is fun to watch the events unfold and the twists and turns are just right for this story.  Only one scene did I find unnecessary but won't be a spoiler. You will know which one it is. All I will say it is on the stairs and it made me laugh.<br />I bought it for my Kindle to take when I travel and need to relax and be entertained.<br />This is a not to be missed one if you like Pierce Brosnan.
B00A285OOW|4.0|I've read all of Gregory's books in this series, and this one is second only to The White Queen. Although it is fiction, it is a great story about reactions and motivations of Elizabeth of York and Henry VII.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|Arthur C. Clarke's stories just seem to get better with age.  I have enjoyed reading most everything he has written.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|A good film, not great.  A terrific ensemble of traditional actors.  Story is just so so.  A good endeavour by Dustin Hoffman.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is an incredible book - regardless of your religious beliefs, Aslan approaches all of the material that make up the stories of The Bible from a historian's perspective.  Historical does not mean dry, however; Aslan paints a vivid picture of the life and times in which Jesus of Nazareth lived, and as such the book is, page after page (or screen after screen in the Kindle version) an eye-opener.  It won't confirm your faith if you're Christian, it won't turn you into an Atheist, it won't make your palms grow hair - it's simply a great read of a man that, incredibly, we really didn't know much about before.  Reza Aslan's research is painstaking - we feel like we can start to get to know Jesus of Nazareth now, and you know what? He's worth getting to know.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|The game has a nice story line but no instructions. It drops you into the home castle of a rewarding council with a mystery to solve.  Without much direction about how to navigate I had to tap on just about every object onscreen. Could be a great game but needs to be more kind to its players.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I totally &hearts; this game I have played it on the apple products and I loved it I am so happy they put it on the kindle. if u r having troble on the plane game because u cant blow don't worry u can go to the settings and turn it off
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|Great animation (if you're into that), but the movie itself is boring.  It has a lot of machismo, so guys would probably like it.  By this I mean, there's a lot of males trying to prove they're &#34;the boss&#34; by beating each other up; and there's a young woman who acts like a typical male who's full himself -- i.e., she goes against her father and sets out to prove she's tougher than he thinks and she can take care of herself, only to be rescued in the end by, you guessed it, Jack.
B001HN694K|5.0|I am a life long fan of both &#34;Alice In Wonderland&#34; and the works of Tim Burton. I heard about this movie about a year before it came to theaters. I waited with eager anticipation. When I finally saw it I felt richly rewarded! All my favorite characters and a few new interpretations of ones I had never seen before presented in the beloved familiar Burton style in a tale that is respectful of the classic but unique so as not to be redundant. I cannot say enough praise for this movie. I am glad to own the DVD and enjoy every rewatching.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|Lots of blood, guts, and unnecessary swearing.  I thought it would be more akin to The Brothers Grimm (which was okay), but it was just completely stupid.  I was so bored while watching this.  I couldn't wait for it to end.  I only watched it to the end because I paid to rent it.  My advice: don't waste your money or time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The way the author tied up the intersecting character's stories and lives into a neat package was great! Makes you reflect on the consequences, intended or not, of even our seemingly tiniest actions and choices.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is fun for all ages. It has a lot of exciting features that keep you involved and interested.
B007SGM084|4.0|Extremely well written but the sex is overdone quite a bit. Woulda still been an excellent book if the author had a few less sex scenes.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really like hidden object games and this one is really good. Also I like that you can play this game without paying real money if your patient.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|A great buy at a great price. Lorde has a soulful, cool, and mellow tone to her voice. If you like artist like Fiona Apple, you will love her.  I can't believe she is only 16!  Looking forward to future music from Lorde.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very great story.  The main character, Hazel is witty, spunky and very likeable.  Didn't end how I thought it would, but was a great read.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Easy to use for us non tech savvy users. I like the reminder feature as well. Free just makes it that much better.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Such an amazing book! I never wanted to put it down! It has a bit of everything you want; action, love story, and mystery!
B00884GR0W|5.0|I lick it a lot but I want meltiplayer  that gose all over the web and a chat botton<br />Then pepol wold be intresded and play more

B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mincraft but it needs updats for endermen and when its to the computer vershon don't stop keep going
B00CL68BK2|4.0|The movie had a great cast and we thought it was surprisingly funny. We gave it a 4 star because it wasn't the best movie we have ever seen but it was good enough to recommend to others.
B009WUBERW|2.0|Weak story line with illogical and transparent actors attempting to input their past characters of the old age of  fame
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|so awesome...written in a way that was understandable and humerous..with many insights and gold nuggets that changed my understanding of the world I thought I understood...compatible to &#34;what the bleep&#34; and &#34;I am&#34; and &#34;the secret&#34;
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|While this book provides a model for understanding how different people may express their love, which I have experienced to hold some merit, it should not be taken as canonical. A model, after all, is but a simplified representation of something much grander. Nevertheless, it is a good read for anyone who is ever in a relationship :)
B00EQ0CKRQ|3.0|Not attractive GUI, ok graphics, microtransactions, and average gameplay. The game is not for everyone and is obviously a weak attempt at knocking Need for Speed out of the market.
B000NI8F5G|5.0|The story is enjoyable, the dance scenes are impeccable, the dialogue is witty, and the whole movie flows like a dream (except for one extra, extra long dance sequence towards the end). Ultimately, a must-see.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Always look forward to a Sophia book!  This one was a fun ride, many twists & turns, I did not know where it would end
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is a master story-teller, as evidenced by his TWO Hugos and his other work, such as The Way of Kings. While this book clearly more geared towards Young Adults, the story and characters are simply gripping, with action and mysteries abound! Read it in one breath, lost sleep, but was ultimately quite happy and satisfied when I put the book down - especially because I know that he is already working on a sequel!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|You really like to leave all your readers hanging.... Loving the story but now can't wait for the next book.....
B004UID2LC|5.0|Is a very good app for the kindles  and smarth phones. I do reccomend this application! Take time to try out this application!
