B00BHU261S|5.0|I don't claim to know how accurate this story is, but it's believable. It has two plots: the making of Psycho and the remaking of Hitchcock's marriage to Alma.  Both plots are handled with a touch of class and  some superfine acting.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|One of  Arthur C. Clarke's best stories. I enjoy reading his stories and this is a great twist on the &#34;visitors from outer space&#34; theme.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This show is great. I talk about the character with my wife when we aren't watching. I don't do that about any other show. Great!
B007REV4T8|4.0|Daniel Craig has done an excellent job portraying Ian Flemming's spy / assain James Bond.  All three of the Daniel Craig Bond films are excellent.  Although no one can beat Sean Connery; Daniel Craig comes in at a VERY close second.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Very well done! This is a must see.  Amazing special effects.  I have to go online and find out how they did this.  The acting = excellent!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Nice shooter for a tablet or mobile game. Great graphics and a awesome story line with a fun multiplayer as well!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Five stars for an amazingly fun read.  The characters truly come to life and each chapter ends with the reader (me) begging for more!  I can't wait to begin the Shift saga to continue this exciting ride.  PS I read a review that there is no Wool in the story, untrue...Jahns knitted and they clean the sensors with wool.  Just had to set the record straight ;)
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Bought as gift for grandson who loves it.  All the extra material are a plus. Nice keepsake for a classic set of movies.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Even though I was born in the late 80's I'm more of a 90's kid so the gaming characters were only somewhat familiar to me.  Regardless, good story line and characters so it all came together nicely.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|Pitch Perfect was about as mediocre of a movie as you can find. It's wasn't bad, but it was certainly a letdown based upon the expectations I had after reading so many of the reviews here about how &#34;hilarious&#34; it was. It kept my interest for the most part - but was otherwise predictable and it offered nothing more than a couple of small chuckles.<br /><br />Worth watching if you can go into it with zero expectations.
B008B8A9V8|3.0|Better technique photos, more different sorts of cast-ons and bind offs rather than slight variations of the same, clearer written instructions.  Just, more. This is a good reference for a determined beginner or an intermediate knitter looking to expand their toolset. I think it would be hard for a beginner to follow the techniques and there's not much here for an advanced knitter. Overall a disappointment.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I had heard so much about this documentary and having grown up in Detroit and having never heard of Rodriquez, my curiousity was piqued.  It was better than I had imagined.  What a lovely man with a lovely soul and his daughters were a testament to his humility and goodness.  I have already ordered Cold Fact and my enthusiasm for the music prompted my colleague to ask me to  order one for him also.  Don't miss this one!
B000FBFMFW|5.0|This series is extremely engaging. Expect to have your heart jerked around, though. Life isn't fair for any of us, and that most certainly includes Fitz.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I would describe the tale, thus far, as an adaptation of Tolkein's The Hobbit in somewhat the same way that the current Sherlock Holmes' movies and TV show are adaptations of the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories. Some of the changes are puzzling.  Others work well.  Overall, the movie is a great success but is not spellbinding.
1594487154|5.0|\\"To Sell Is Human\\" really hit the mark for me.  In my business it's all about creating and maintaining relationships, a much deeper involvement than many transactional sales, and Dan's book gives great insight into taking a longer view.  I particularly like the chapter on Clarity where he writes about how finding problems (which people often don't know or understand that they have) is more valuable than trying to sell a solution.  I find that someone selling a solution is like a carpenter whose only tool is a hammer -- all the problems look like nails.<br /><br />I also liked the sample cases at the end of the chapters to be helpful in brining the abstract to life.<br /><br />Well done Dan!
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Best movie .  I love watching old movies from the 80's and 90's so innocent and pure.  This movie is just a reminder of fun.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|Strong-willed southern woman, doing the right thing, and refusing to let someone tell her who she is.<br />Passive southern woman, learning to do the right thing, and learning to be her own person.<br />Abuser getting what he deserves - lesser of the evils.<br />All in a funny way.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Get rhis book, very interesting story . Would make a great movie .<br />Would Recommend this  to any reader who is into this topic
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I really enjoy the game and the graphics are great! It is well done and a pleasure. Can't wait to complete all the levels
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is a great album and the first I have actually purchased in nearly 5 years. I am a huge fan of Macklemore and what he represents to the recording industry. Keep it up!
B008D30K7E|5.0|This was one of those reads that I didn't want it to finish. It is a story that is just what is needed with all the doom and gloom around to lift you,and leave you with a big smile on your face. Do have a read...
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Probably the only series or movie I have ever watched that followed the book exactly! The characters are just as described! If you read and enjoyed the books you will be pleased.
B008O2T3O0|5.0|Great singers, excellent audio/video.  Staging hard to understand due to director's decisions re costumes.  Otherwise excellent performance and wonderful entertainment
B008NW67E0|5.0|I love their music, I own their first CD so of coarse I Enjoyed this one just as much. :)
B001TH16DI|3.0|Blue Ray is only as good as the source and many of these movies where made prior to Laser disk let alone blue ray so the sound and video quality is mediocre when compared to a newly released film. still good to see these at the best they can be made.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|We loved this movie in our house - in fact we bought two copies so that my older daughter, when she moves out later this fall.  The only thing I didn't like was that the price was similar if not more than if we went Target or Walmart... I really like to get deals and it's one of the reasons I've been doing so much shopping on Amazon.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I was really excited to read this book since it got great reviews...I wish there was an age range posted when people write reviews. I'm not saying that this book was the worst book I've ever read...but to me, it did not live up to the reviews and was disappointing. Maybe I'm too old for this story line? Being in my late 20's...I think I'm past the whole \\"teenage love at first sight and I will marry you tomorrow if I could \\" plot. More suitable for kids in middle/high school. This was just way too unbelievable.<br /><br />The first half of this story was OK. The 2nd half of the book really dragged for me. A lot of the interactions between the main characters seemed very repetitive throughout the entire book. I found myself skimming through the conversations because it was nothing different, and frankly became just too much to read over and over again. There are very important things that you learn in the 2nd half; but once everything is tied together at the end, it just felt so unbelievable and fake for me. Normally the ending of stories such as these give me a some sort of feeling emotionally; I did not feel anything. The word \\"Hopeless\\" was used way too much in this book; felt cheesy since it's the title.<br /><br />Felt like I wasted my time with this one. Too bad that it's my first book by this author.
B000021Y7X|5.0|One of the best live music DVD's I have ever come across. I have had 4 different friends and family members go out and buy this DVD after watching it at my place. Arrived very quickly and in great condition! I have nothing but extremely positive feedback for the DVD itself and the supplier.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's fun but repeditive. More challenge needed.<br />Great for beginers and beyond. Almost like the game on cruise ships without all the background noise.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|One of my Friends recommended it. I LOVE IT!, My only complaint is that my Kindle does NOT have a Camera. Everything besides that is AMAZING! Keep it up, Gameloft!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it ! it is really fun. I have all of the people. :). it is harder then the first one. if u did not play the first one don't play this until u play the first one
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love this! It brings me right back to the good ol' '80s. I played Pac-Man for hours in the arcade, then a faux Pac-Man on my grandparent's TRS-80 and also on my oh-so-awesome Atari 2600 [which I still have]. I was always better at Ms Pac-Man, but I love this App.
B000PMGS8G|4.0|The very end of the movie has been changed!  In the original and the Queen soundtrack, the Ming's floating servant's last line is \\"Hail Flash Gordon! Savior of the Universe!\\"  In this version, the last line is \\"Long live Flash! You've saved your Earth!\\"
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I have read all of the Jack Reacher books and have enjoyed all. This one was particularly interesting and in depth.  I am only disappointed that TOM CRUISE (what is he about 5'5&#34; ) was chosen to play Reacher in the first movie!!!!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|The story line was very good. There's a couple typical crashes and chase scenes. All in all just an enjoyable movie.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This is an entertaining and thought provoking show with a little humor thrown in to boot. Have enjoyed watching seasons 1 and 2 and am now into season 3. If you enjoy sci-fi that teeters on the edge of believable , here it is!
1452110581|4.0|This book will keep any cat lover smiling. It's silly, it's small and it's creative.<br />Cats explained, in their own words.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|Stephen Greenblatt has done a lifetime's worth of research into the rise of the modern world; here he calls attention to the work of Lucretius, On the Nature of Things, which turns out to have atomic theory and  evolution discussed within its elegant poetry. In the process of recounting the rediscovery of this work, greenblatt gives a glimpse of life in Early Modern Italy, The Roman Catholic Church, book production, and the love of knowledge that spurred the Renaissance. Although Greenblatt is occasionally burdened with detail, and from time to time indulges in speculation about the motives of those long dead, he has written a fascinating, informative and exciting work which ultimately connects an ancient, seminal text with the founding of the United States.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|this is one of the most enjoyable books I read in a while. it's a page turner and you will find yourself reading for hours and not able to put the book down. It has a lot of insight into the world of ultrarunners which I didn't know exist or humanly possible. because of the book I now run with a HUGE smile on my face (read the book to know why) :)))
B009VMN3RA|2.0|Depressing and disturbing account of a very sad child/woman.  The picture  she presents of her mother and father is one of self indulgence.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Good for an understanding of the history during this era.  Although I'm sure the story was embellished a bit to draw people in!
B003U4XS34|5.0|To understand LOST, you need to start with Season Six, Episode 15.  Then, go back to Season 1, Episode 1.<br /><br />Light=Life source protected, kinda like Garden of Eden post-Fall.  Explains the storyline of LOST.  Else, it will be very hard to cope with the extensive disinformation about this series in the minds of its many viewers, who mistake it for afterlife and sideways-time-travel (which doesn't exist).<br /><br />Theme here is set for a fusion of Greek-god-style mythology, and modern scientific ideas about life and light as what gives life.  In science and modern New Age (nee: gnostic) ideas, speculation is that somehow there are energy sources combined with magnetism which somehow gave rise to life.  In LOST, the idea is that these sources are placed around the world, all around some 'center' that feeds them all.  Further, that you can travel in TIME.  Whether or not you can actually redo or change life as a result, is another issue explored in the series.<br /><br />So Season Six Episode 15, posits the Greek-god version, because by Season Six, you've already been exposed to the so-called 'scientific' concepts of light, magnetism, spacetime, etc.  The whole goal of LOST is to show some fusion of science and faith, leaving it up to the viewer, how he concludes.  You're not beat over the head with one idea of faith or science;  the writers leave out a lot of the details, therefore, so you can put the pieces together yourself.<br /><br />This much of the plot I can say, without giving the show away:  in the beginning, there was Light and Smoke.  The latter was trapped by the former, and neither could directly kill the other, so each 'invited' people to the island on which both resided.  The Light wanted to benefit the people and have them protect it from other people.  The Smoke wanted to encourage people to kill the Light, so the Smoke could escape.  But if it escaped, it would kill everyone.<br /><br />That's kinda how Greek mythology goes.  Personifying everything seen in nature, and also personifying virtues and vices.  Greek drama always aimed at showing that human life was an extension of the various relationships and struggles between 'the gods'.  But in LOST, this and Episode 9 are the only Episodes dealing directly with that theme.  Episode 15's script is kinda trite, it's faithful to Greek drama (whose script was always melodramatic on purpose, anyway).  Watch it first and then 9, if you want a fuller sense of the plotlines, prior to beginning at Season One, Episode 1;  from there on, watch sequentially.<br /><br />LOST is meant to beg the question of why you are here.erything seen in nature, and also personifying virtues and vices.

B003D5FDEC|5.0|Joe was an astonishing talent.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy any album that includes him.  I have this and perhaps a dozen or two other albums featuring Joe.  My parents took me to a Concord (California) Jazz concert in the early 1970's, and Joe, playing with Herb Ellis, was on the bill.  WOW!  I was a fledgling guitarist (still am) and Joe and Herb dumbfounded me.  I never missed an opportunity to see them, and then Joe alone or in other ensembles after he split from Herb, whenever he was within driving distance.  In a period of one month I saw him in a group with Oscar Petersen and Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen in Buffalo and then solo in a small club in New York and in concert solo in Cleveland. Unforgettable.  I listen to this album from time to time and still marvel at his knowledge of the guitar neck, all the chord forms and his wonderful bass lines.  His life had its ups and downs and he left us far too soon.  I highly, highly recommend this album.  Others I really, really like would include these with Herb Ellis:<br />[[ASIN:B000000YXG Two for the Road]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00008VGMR Seven Come Eleven]]<br /><br />These are old albums.  Search around.  Mine are vinyl.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This film is a must for a great family collection.  The wrecking action is even better in 3D.  Disney did made another hit with this film.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|Great movie - watched it on line this time and the download was unclear and out of sync. Found out that stopping and restarting cleared up the problem. Same thing happened with Pitch Perfect. I'm just saying.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie was the first one I saw in 3D in theaters.  It is just as good in 3D at home.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it! Great detail and it was amazing! I'm going to go watch the movie now so yes bye loves
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|Jack Frost comes into his own in this film.  This is a very enjoyable film that I would recommend for any family.
B005JLNALG|4.0|This is going to be a bit of a strange review.  I actually purchased \\"Road Salt II\\" and have not heard \\"Road Salt I\\", so it may be a bit odd to review this one not having heard the first part of this 2 CD concept piece, but here goes.  Pain Of Salvation are one of those bands that seem to really frustrate some of their fan base.  They started out as a pretty straight forward progressive metal band, but over the years have branched out a lot into more experimental and varied styles of music.  To the metal purists this is not a positive move, but to those willing to go along with some of Daniel Gildenlow's more adventurous exploits the listen can be quite rewarding.  This album did not click with me right away, but slowly grew on me with repeated listens, to the point where I think it is a really strong piece of work.  Musically the album is all over the place with progressive metal, folk, AOR rock, ballads and just about everything in between in the mix.  I have not studied the lyrics close enough to really understand the overall theme behind the story, and having not heard the first album it is kind of like coming into the middle of a movie, so I am not exactly sure what it is all about.  That being said, I think the lyrics are quite inventive and well done.  Daniel's vocals are, as always are outstanding.  The guy really has an incredible range and is able to sing several different styles competently.  My favorite track on the album is \\"1979\\" which sits right in the middle of the disc.  In a perfect world would this track would be all over rock radio.  Alas, the mainstream continues to ignore Pain Of Salvation which is too bad as this album deserves more exposure.  I guess the bottom line to all of this is that, as with most recent Pain Of Salvation albums, the fan base is going to have mixed reviews on this one.  Personally I like it and with repeated listens the material has really grown on me.  My advice would be to giver this one several spins before judging it, and your ears will be rewarded.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This was another look back at what shaped Bond to be who he is.  Great film and can't wait for the next.
B000025XE5|5.0|Great collection of songs from the Troggs. From the Classic Wild Thing To a Girls Like You to I Can't Control Myself, this CD has the best of the best.
B0090SI460|5.0|Finally they released this in 3D.  I enjoyed this film before and enjoy it even more in 3D.  All the laughs and scares jumping out at ya.
B00BLCHYKU|1.0|The story is ugly and bleak. Low point - when a child says, &#34;My parents are having sex.&#34; How low will you go?
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|I have recently become a &#34;The Following&#34; fan.  As I have missed some installments, I was able to get the &#34;background&#34; I needed.  &#34;The Following&#34; is a great thriller that could have been a two or three installment &#34;made for TV miniseries. Instead of filling the extra space with fluff, the cast and crew fill in the void with absolutely great character development.  The plot twists will keep you very engaged.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I loved the fact that this movie didnt shy away from appealing to the hardcore gamers, and I really appreciated the effort.  Also a great movie even if you arent a gamer.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Good movie. Actors did a great job depicting the true character's. Telling a story and showing what happened without being too vulgar or violent.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|While I didnt like TS2 as much as the first one, this movie blows it out of the water.  Very satisfying conclusion.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I'm not much of a reader but from a guy's standpoint I found it entertaining how the story went and the dialogue of the characters. Reminded me of my grandpa and grandma talking when I was younger.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|OMG! Need I say more. This book was a little hard to take in at first. I was shocked with the way the district had chosen to use children in the games. I know a few of my friends were put off by this and could not read them. I found the book fascinating and a wonderful story of love, commitment, loyalty and bravery. If you seen the movie you still need to read the books. I enjoyed this book a lot more than the movie. The way Suzanne Collins gets you to know her characters in such a personal manner is amazing. It causes you to really cheer for and cry for your favorites. A MUST read!
B001HN694K|5.0|Good quality DVD--fast service--DVD looks brand new--would use this site again --good for teachers in middle and high school--highly recommend this version.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|wonderful show, looking forward to season 4. Its too bad that a single streaming network did not carry the full seasons
B00170I7GG|5.0|It's actually one of my top three favorite movies of all time.  The other is Lost Horizon.  How would you change if you relived the same day over and over?  What would be important?  It's remarkable, actually.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This was an amazing movie. Probably the best feel good movie I have seen in years. I highly recommend this movie for all ages. My 10 & 13 year old loved it too.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|I accidently sent a DVD back to my movie rental company without watching the last episode on it. I was overjoyed to discover how easy it was to order a single episode on Amazon streaming video. Great service and saved me from getting in a lot of trouble with the Mrs.<br /><br />As for Dexter Season 6, I had heard a lot of folks weren't big fans, but I think Colin Hanks does a great job. I remain a big fan of the series as a whole.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|who could not love this character ,he's just as famous as superman and he is still putting out movies  yea !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Not only did I read it, but I also sent it to my daughter and son. We do all have different ways of feeling loved and they often change over time. This was an insightful read.
B007REV4T8|5.0|what can you say other than it's the best 007 movie ever ,daniel craig is the best even though i like all the other 007's but who's next ?

B0054JZC6E|2.0|this was hard to navigate but when we found the gmes they were great probably would use an a car trip
B0017I1IZA|3.0|Not the best but good I don't think it is super good but it is good that's all I can say
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Fun match game.  Works fine on my Kindle Fire. So far returns to my last level when reloaded.  I WOULD RECOMMEND.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Captivating book.  Read in no time flat!!  Now I need to read the sequels.<br />Very easy to download onto my Kindle.
B006TLFIAQ|4.0|KILLER ELITE is intelligently plotted and intelligently paced: Never a dull moment, but at the same time, it's not just a long and tiresome barrage of shoot-'em-ups and punch-'em-outs. Despite a number of unlikelihoods, all the violence in this film is well-earned. The mere fact that it's based upon a supposedly true story, [[ASIN:0440217849 The Feather Men]], by Sir Ranulph Fiennes (himself an unseen character in the film) enhances the viewing experience.<br /><br />The plotline seems ridiculously simple until the last 40 minutes or so, when the threads begin to thicken. Good acting by all, and the fact that all the major players here have a strong desire to get out of the assassination game adds to their believability as well as their likeability. Really fine use of settings: No gaudy frills, but the variety itself--from Oman to Paris to Australia to SAS Headquarters in Hereford, England--is stimulating.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|Danzel Washington pulls off this awful script with good acting. If he accepts many more movies with writing this bad however, his career will be on the downslide.
B000E6ENSK|5.0|Love this CD.  Play it every time I am in the car on a long trip.  Each item is different from the others, and many of the words ring very true.  This CD has more rhythm and melody than many of the electronic ones and I would rate it along with Robert Miles' \\"Dreamland\\".
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|This movie is really good and leaves you wanting more. Can't wait for the sequel. Must have for fans.  I watched this twice already.
B0052SF6CM|5.0|I love this CD, I cannot stop listening to it.  I just pop it in and don't have to skip any tunes. Also it was in splendid condition and it arrived very quickly.  Recommend this CD!
B009K0P10K|5.0|I waited a long time before watching this show but now I am seriously addicted! You will love it, its a hit.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Sometimes the R3 sticks and can't be pressed down and gets stiff when trying to move it but other than that it works just fine. The shipping was quick and the controller came in one piece.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Great movie, I am a trek fan and was surprised by how good this was. It is no way better than the originals but it kicks the crap out of the cheesy one with Capt Picard.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The characters and story draw me into a fascinating time in the history of England.  Plot and characters are well developed.  I care about the characters and can't wait to see the next series.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Really enjoyed this game. G5 has been stepping it up with their recent games. Decent challenge, good balance of mini-games and hidden object puzzles, fantastic graphics, nice storyline, and awesome length of gameplay for the price. I would definitely recommend this game.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|My husband and I are a fan of the Bond movies and this was no exception. We really enjoyed it and liked the introduction on Moneypenny!
B007MCTTHY|4.0|It's a great time consumer.  All three of us, my husband, my son and myself, like it.  It makes you use your brain.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is pretty fun to play, the only thing I don't like about it is that the prices for upgrading and buildings aren't told ahead of time, so you never know how much you're spending, and then it asks you to buy coins.  For a free game it is pretty fun, though.
B00846WWVM|3.0|My son and I like it but I seem to get bored quickly.  I'm not one for dealing with wheels, cogs, etc., but I think others would consider it a fun game.  I just have to be in the right mood for it.  I think it would be great for kids because it makes a game of physics.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|I liked that some of the same characters of the first one were in it,but season 1 spoiled me. I really wanted a continuation of the first story in the house. I loved the first one.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My grandson has this same monkey as his favorite stuffed animal except this is smaller.  When I found this Monkey Wubbanub on amazon, I had to get it for him.  He loves it!  It is so nice to have a pacifier attached to something.  It is rarely on the floor.  I bought this for him when he was 3 months old and he's 51/2 months now and he still loves it!
0345803507|5.0|If u read this series you know all 3 were great!!!! Some parts & toys I didn't understand... Lol..... But it was a great story!
B003ZJ70W4|1.0|This movie was so disappointing.  These once interesting, sexy women were just vapid, materialistic bores.  Somehow there was a time that their antics were entertaining, but it certainly ended before this movie started.  The sex wasn't even good watching.  What a waste of time and money.
0345803493|5.0|Read all three of these books in one week. Was on vacation in Florida & just laid by the pool & read!!! Relaxing & you can't put them down!!!!!
B00BFHZOCG|2.0|Before you even consider this as an Anthrax album, whom I'm only slightly a fan of, you have to ask yourself: do these songs need to be covered and with the exception of anthem, the easy answer should be no.  On top of that to cover them in a way outside of anthrax and exactly as the original plays makes no sense to me.  Who wants to hear anthrax Karoke???  What garbage.  These songs would never be hits in their own rite and should be left buried as this album is sure to be soon...
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|I downloaded another game and it lagged a lot, but this game is much smoother and the paddle doesn't hop around like the other game did.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Javier was excellent. Daniel was very physical. I would have liked to have seen more driving scenes. Maybe one day they can make a few flash backs about Bonds training days.
B009AP2G26|5.0|This show is so emotional and entertaining. I love it how they kept the original cast in the show. Great!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Was a great read! So happy I decided to read the book after seeing the movie. Can't wait to read the next book.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I was happy with the time I got this, and I love this album. I just love MCR. They're music makes me happy!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|item was brand new, worked fine, no problems.  I can't think of 10 more words to say about it, sorry.
B00006EXL5|5.0|This is one of my Favorite MCR albums. So i absolutely love it! But i didn't like the fact that my package was Basically opened when i received it!!!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It was a thought provoking story.  The animation and color was beautiful. Encouragement for people that loose someone that life must go on.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|i like twitter it follows what ever you want to know about everything and everybody i like the tweets from in session hln
B009GIPDQS|3.0|Not a book that kept me riveted to every page, can't say it was bad, but again, it wasn't that exiting.<br />At one stage of the book I thought I was reading a different story, about different people, and I seemed a bit lost, I had to go back to see if I could piece, the two stories together.<br />Two thirds through the book I finally caught up with the story.<br />As I've said  OK, but that's all.<br /><br />Warriuka
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|My granddaughter watches this on a daily basis, she loves tinkerbell and all the fairies. She has all four tinkerbell movies.
B000W21640|5.0|I have loved this album since I was a young teen. It was made way before my age, but I always thought I was born too late anyway to enjoy them in their original youth. At least I get to ENJOY this album.
B005IZLPMY|3.0|So the movie itself was &#34;just ok&#34;. A little slow. I watched this because I LOVED &#34;The Avengers&#34; but yet I could tell while watching that movie that they really had expected that you watched all of the other prelude movies leading up to it like &#34;Iron Man&#34;, &#34;Captain America&#34;, &#34;Thor&#34;, etc. So thinking those movies would be as good as the Avengers I grabbed them. I had already seen &#34;Iron Man&#34; and &#34;Iron Man 2&#34; which is what got me interested in the Avengers to begin with (which were both GREAT films) but hadn't seen the others.<br /><br />Captain America was &#34;ok&#34; but does give you a little better background going into the Avengers.<br /><br />The packaging for this was great, the extra content was ok, and having the digital edition was important to me.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and the character development. it has a good flow and it is easy to keep reading it.
B0037A4ILC|4.0|This is an impressive climbing movie with a throwaway romantic subplot. There's another subsubplot about Nazi propaganda, but our climbers don't care about that and neither should we.<br /><br />The movie develops great visual contrasts between the suffering of the mountaineers and the comfortable life of the viewers in a luxury hotel at the bottom of the mountain. For example, when the climbers are freezing, we cut to a warm fire in the lobby.<br /><br />The romantic subplot, whether historic or a creature of the director's imagination, distracts from the real story. The film loses too much energy at the newspaper in Berlin and the love interest's editor in the hotel.  We don't need this for the drama - I'd have preferred to keep the tourists more faceless, as a stand-in for all of us watching the film.<br /><br />The director does an impressive job holding the pace back. Hollywood would ruin this story with quick cuts and too much editing. The Germans still know to let the action take its time, and that really builds the tension. The climbing shots are consistently amazing - kudos to the director and cinematographer.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|a little slow but ok graphics pretty neat could have more to do bit still neat to to play around with
B00B99KJR0|3.0|Constantly trying to up sell. Highly derivative, there are a thousand games like this without the constant pestering.was rather disappointed, even for a faotd. Worth it if you have never played a match three style game.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|This movie does not even come close to enjoying the book.  Apples to oranges I know but this version could have been better.  I would rather pull my toe nails out than to sit through this again.
B009YX02T8|5.0|I've been a Twilight fan since the beginning.  I've been buying all the soundtracks for the Twilight series.  I love listening to music I don't usually listen to.  If I like one of the songs on the soundtracks, I can look who the artist is and look at their albums.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was home for several days with a bad cold so passed the time away by watching all of the season of Downton Abbey.  I was really surprised at how good each episode was.  This is just the right amount of drama and humor to keep you watching.  I was especially hooked with the final episode of Season 3.  We will return.
B005LAII80|4.0|I don't usually buy hard copies of films but when I heard the DVD sales of Dredd will determine if the movie gets a sequel or not, I felt like I had to chip in. It doesn't hurt that this is a great movie and is worth owning anyways.<br /><br />You'll love the colors, the sound design, the slow motion effects, the simple plot, the setting, and the characters.<br /><br />You'll hate the slow motion effects, the simple plot, the low budget, and the feeling of wanting more.<br /><br />For some the slow motion will disrupt the pace of the film but for others it will enhance the 3D experience and visual one as well. The fact the movie takes place all in one building block, might put off some viewers due to lack of variety in setting but some might  think of it as a neat storytelling tool; It makes it feel like the story is taking place in real-time. The low budget means that there are moments that feel like there could have been more or done better if the budget were higher; for example, the movie might have taken place in more than one building block or had a more climactic ending. Speaking of the ending, it is more or less lacking. I feel that this is a fault due to the script as much as it is because of the budget. The whole movie feels like a demo for potential Dredd sequels.<br /><br />Regardless of all this, I really enjoyed watching Dredd and I am curious to see more of him, Anderson and Mega City 1. Urban IS Dredd, his performance had me smiling the whole time. Thrilby as Anderson gave me another celebrity crush. And Mega City 1 is a setting with SO much possibilities for future stories (can't say much without spoiling some plot points).<br /><br />Buy it, love it, and pray for a sequel with as much vigor as this one.<br /><br />9/10 would judge again.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I got this on my phone, I don't recommend that if you don't like looking at your phone. Otherwise everything else is great about the book!
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|this was a good movie very scary the only reason it didnt get 4 stars was because the movie was dark and hard to make out waht was going on sometimes
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My granddaughter age 6 loves everything about this game.<br />There are several steps that require the player to help the shoppers.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|This guys lives what so many of us would love to experience.  This film allows us to experience it from the comfort or our couch.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I only recently got into this series and am currently on Seas 2. So far, its interesting, informative and exciting. I love this series and the characters. Streaming from Amazon was great as the quality was really good. Thank you Amazon!!<br />- and no, I an not an employee of Amazon! (just in case someone is wondering, :)<br />I am sad that this show has ended.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's fun but a lot of the goals have to do with facebook and I don't want to link it with my facebook.

B009FZHYKU|2.0|Seems like too many episodes waste time and have little to do with the story. I enjoyed season 1 the best.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|DeMille is an author I buy simply because he wrote the book. I'm loving it on Kindle; I can re-acquire all his writing as I have time to read them. Simply one of the most entertaining authors out there. Local or exotic locals, conflicted characters...DeMill has them all, and does them full justice.
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|Love playing this game. Interesting story; fun puzzles. Keeps you busy for hours.  I recommend buying this game. Fun for all ages. ;o)
B004HW7JH4|5.0|I love this series, always entertaining and fun to watch.  Looking forward to season 6 and seeing the cast again.
B00A83075M|1.0|First of all, let me say that neither I, nor my eight-year old son felt the need to finish the movie though the other three kids enjoyed it and my husband might rate it a three just because of the video game nostalgia it generated.  The storyline seemed to be a mash-up of all three \\"Toy Story\\" movies, \\"Shrek\\" and \\"Up\\".  The characters were annoying as were their voices, though I did like John C. Reilly's voice for Ralph. The humor was weak and inconsistent.  We rented it from Amazon Prime and have no plans to buy the DVD. Please, Disney, tell me you are not going to fall back into the dark ages of the late 20th/early 21st century, when you thought \\"Brother Bear\\", \\"Treasure Planet\\" and \\"Atlantis\\" were all good ideas!
1601251505|5.0|This pen-and-paper RPG is fantastic!  I have been playing these types of game for 25+ years now, and I'm really enjoying this one in particular.  I like the game mechanics, based on advanced D&D 3.0 and 3.5 systems, with quite a few tweaks.  All in all, this is a great system.  The design makes it easy for beginners to pick up and play, and fresh enough for seasoned vets to take to rather quickly.  Top notch!
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|this is my fav. show on TV.  Ilove he dierent sars and how they have developed over the seasons, good wriing
0307352153|2.0|I did not like this book. I'm not even sure I should be reviewing it, as I didn't finish it and have absolutely no intention of doing so. I feel I was misled into thinking this was a book based on scientific results, and although there are a number of studies used, I feel these were carefully chosen by the author to promote her stand point: introverts are better. An example of this is a quote by psychologist Jerry Miller, director of the Center for the Child and the Family at the University of Michigan. \\"The stereotype of the university professor is accurate for so many people on campus. They like to read; for them there's nothing more exciting than ideas. And some of this has to do with how they spent their time when they were growing up. If you spend a lot of time charging around, then you have less time for reading and learning. There's only so much time in your life.\\"<br /><br />One thing I liked about this book was that it made me think about the way in which I teach and whether I'm catering to all learning types and styles. Am I taking into consideration that some people would just prefer to work alone? \\"Our schools should teach children the skills to work with others - cooperative learning can be effective when practiced well and in moderation - but also the time and training they need to deliberately practice on their own.\\" (Cain) That in itself is a pertinent question when teaching in Asia, as broadly speaking many students prefer working alone. However, communicative learning has proved successful and is generally regarded highly within the EFL world.<br /><br />As adults we need to be able to communicate effectively with others. There are very few jobs in the world where you can work completely on your own. Even writers, who most probably write their books in the confines of their own company, seek help from other writers. Once their book is published they will often do talks to help promote their books, because as much as one writes for the joy of writing, one also writes to earn a living and therefore needs those books to sell.<br /><br />I don't want you to misunderstand me; I wanted to like this book, but I felt it was too black and white. Instead of it being about how we can learn from each other, draw from each other's strengths and make allowances for each other's weaknesses, it was a boxing match with introverts in one corner and extroverts in the other.g, one also writes to earn a living and therefore needs those books to sell.<br /><br />I don't want you to misunderstand me; I wanted to like this book, but I felt it was too black and white.

B005LAIHPY|3.0|Possibly, I'm having a favorable reaction to the movie because I expected it to be horrible. But it wasn't. I expected there to be no story at all so was more than a little surprised that it had a bit of one. Cliche, for sure, but, still, there was a story. I'm not sure why these things -always- have to be about the slacker that doesn't live up to his potential until something catastrophic happens, because, generally speaking, when something catastrophic happens to a slacker not living up to his potential, disaster follows. But, then, that's probably why we want movies about the guys that do rise above the situation.<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />So the story is flimsy, but flimsy  is better than nothing. The acting was decent. The effects were spectacular. If you're looking for a good popcorn flick that you don't have to pay tons of attention to, this could be your movie.
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book is written to be easily understandable, by anyone. They explain why some foods are bad for you and tell you what foods are good for you. They also show you how to set up your pantry for this diet, and that isn't a simple task. I plan on using this style of eating for the rest of my life.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Set in Middle-earth sixty years before The Lord of the Rings trilogy, An Unexpected Journey tells the tale of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who is convinced by the wizard Gandalf to accompany thirteen dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield on a quest across Middle-earth to reclaim the Lonely Mountain(their home) from Smaug the dragon.<br /><br />You know, I'm really happy that I decided not to read any reviews or ask anyone of their opinion of the movie before getting the movie. After watching the movie and, now, reading those said reviews and hearing opinions; there's quite abit of hate out there(especially with alot of the professional critics online). I've been hoping & waiting on this movie since the LoTR trilogy started way back in 2001. I realize The Hobbit has had a long and arduous journey making it to the big screen but I'm happy with the outcome, honestly. When I first heard that Peter Jackson was making The Hobbit into three films, I-too- was one of those that thought Warner Brothers was milking it for all it was worth. Yet, after viewing this first film, I can figure out why. I think I'm going to like where Peter Jackson goes with this.<br /><br />Unlike everyone else, the CGI didn't bother me so much. True, the Uruk-hai seemed more formidable and scary in the LoTR movies because they were real actors in makeup and whatnot. However, the orcs and goblins as well as the battles didn't look, at all, phony to me.<br /><br />While The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey may not quite reach the greatness or allure of the movies from the LoTR trilogy; it is definitely a 'journey' worth taking..nonetheless.<br /><br />\\"Them hobbitses!!!!\\".....

B000YXMMAE|4.0|Of course Radiohead has lots of good songs but this album is at the same time soothing and hitting some inner chords of primal fear....like something from the walking dead tv series... just a hint ...but it is there.<br />Why the 4 stars and not 5? Simply because I don't think their best is out yet :)
B00BKTWBMA|4.0|I have grown up with EC and I am still doing so. I especially love his rendition of \\"Still Got the Blues\\" by the late Gary Moore. It is more gentle than Gary's version but that is what I might expect. \\"Goodnight Irene\\" is a favorite too. \\"Gotta Get Over\\" takes me back to some of the great EC of the 80's. In reality, it really doesn't matter what he does. He has lived a hell of a life from all accounts and is still here giving us something to talk about..........I don't mind at all growing old with EC.
B00AQF8CJ0|3.0|The game is very entertaining, but I find it takes, ummm, 20 turns to get all the stars. I wouldn't have it any other way. A challenge will keep you interested a lot longer than a simple answer will. I don't like the extra power for $$$, cheapens things, and breaks grandma!

B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|Game was ok. It may have looked better on a tablet instead of my phone. I deleted the app after a day or two.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book a lot. Lisa quickly drew me into the lives of Alice, John and their children. My own grandmother suffered from dementia during the final years of her life, so perhaps that added to my interest in the story. I just found it so beautifully written, so frustrating to watch Alice go through the trials of her disease, so touching to see how the relationship she had with her youngest daughter evolved as things progressed. All in all, a great, great book.

B007N85POS|4.0|A nice, easy app for the kindle fire. Smooth graphics and great sound efx! I would recommend getting a stylus to play as the game is played via touch screen-something I wasnt used to as I usually play Ab on my laptop using the keys.

B0063M22QO|5.0|I've played this on my computer for years so enjoy being able to play on my Kindle Fire.  Good game
B003V4AK8E|5.0|This controller feels like an xbox controller and really helped me enjoy the PS3. After trying with the vanilla PS3 controller i found that my hands hurt and i just could not perform as well in similar games. I play BF3 on both xbox and now ps3 and this controller was the only way i could perform as well on both consoles. I'm going to be dumping my standard ps3 controllers now.<br /><br />I read the reviews here and was initially worried about dead zones. i experienced dead zones out of the box and was disappointed. however after i let it charge overnight i noticed the dead zones went away!<br /><br />Overall very satisfied customer!
B008Y73940|5.0|First movie I tried on my Kindle Fire.  I loved the movie & am sure I will enjoy the Kindle Fire on flights.
B000FC1MM8|3.0|This is a decent story but not exactly scintilating.  Read because it is not awful.  Nice mystery but not my favorite.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Like knowing how much of a charge my Kindle has at all time.  Very easy to use.  Recommend it to all
B004H8GLXQ|4.0|This is a book that I enjoyed and have recommended to others.  It's a bit of a Gothic tale -- set in an isolated manor home out on the moors with a mysterious main character.  However, the plot is well-woven and has unique threads.  One hint: ignore the young writer's angst about her mother and twin.  It's not important to the story and not worth trying to figure out.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love being able to check the weather where my family lives as well as where we are.  Recommend it to all.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Purchased this app and after several installation attempts, this app will not install. I just disappears after it says it is installing.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Una de las mejores novelas de Lee Child. Como siempre domina la acci&oacute;n y el estilo cinematogr&aacute;fico. La trama es mas cre&iacute;ble en esta novela, que en alguna de las anteriores.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am a late comer to The Walking Dead having just recently watched Seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix and downloaded Season 3 here to get caught up.  This is a character driven show, with an intense storyline, lots of action and of course those incredible zombies.  This is a show about the people trying to survive in a world that has changed forever. AMC has reputation for producing top shelf television and The Walking Dead is, in my opinion, their best program.  The cast is amazing, lead by Andrew Lincoln, who must be awarded an Emmy at some point, or it will be a crime.  The production value is top notch.  Filmed like a movie, with some gorgeous cinematography.  The writing is the thing that makes this show so incredible. The storyline is fast paced, but most of all each character grows and changes so things are never stagnant.  I highly recommend The Walking Dead.
B004X75RCW|4.0|The Proposal didn't rate well with critics, but I found it immensely entertaining and love it! I highly recommend this film for a light evening viewing.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is the best TV show I believe I've ever watched. Love everything about it. The actual DVD quality is excellent as well.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is fun but, the energy should update faster. Also you should be able to exit the game easier when your done playing and when it's restored your full strength it should automatically show when you open the game back. It should be easier to get diamonds also not just when you get to a new level.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|It's steamy, dysfunctional, chaotic. It's also a fascinating look into human character, this period of our history, and it's plain funny too. Love it.
B0013TPVGK|5.0|This book is definitely worth a read. Sometimes its really deep and outside the box, but for the most part its really unique. Any musician stuck in a rut should check this out. It's a really eye opening look into the world of music.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|Haven't read a sci fi book for a long time.  Interesting blend of fact and fantasy, explaining past and future.
0757302661|5.0|A friend told me about this technic and I wish I would have had time to take the class but, the book was very comforting, teaches you a great technique on how to try to relax and I just wish this tecnique was used more by doctors, giving birth is a natural thing of the body of a woman but, this book is super relaxing and I wish more women know about it.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|the album is great! I think Adele is one of the best singers we have today and the songs are lovely.
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|This movie raises the bar on CG effects.  They are truely amazing.  The story is interesting but no great.  I enjoyed the 3D effects on my home screen.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Fabulous character development, credible and relevant story line and excellent actors kept us hooked.  This is a story about our world today and the threats we live with.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|This is one of the best military fighter aircraft movies ever made.  Tom Cruize is perfect in the role he plays.  BluRay and 3D improve and already great movie.  If you like this type movie, then you'll enjoy this one.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|All of the acting is superb. The first two years were great can't wait to view year 3, but will wait until its free for prime members.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|Cirque never ceases to amaze.  These athletes doe things that appear almost impossible to us mere mortals.  If you like this type performance art, then I highly recommend this collection.  The 3D effect is good too.
0399226907|5.0|A smaller version of what I had when I was little, but still a great book!! Nice hard board book, very sturdy.
B00BMCLCG6|4.0|I started liking about half songs from samples. Since it had a good intro price that was enough for me to buy. Now I like most of the songs. I did not get deluxe which has 3 extras. Some of the songs like title song and Because We Can track I liked right away. Others I had to listen to a few times e.g. The Water Made me but those songs became favorites too. I don't have the list here to go song by song.<br />Jon's voice is changing as he gets older but he still delivers a song like no other and most of them are upbeat and hopeful yet still give me pause and make me think in some cases.
075666733X|5.0|beautiful images. the text is interesting but short enough for a general audience. the large size makes it a book worth looking at again and again. definitely recommend.
B00BHU9DUK|3.0|Most, but not all of the action takes place in a large theatre or opera house, with different sets moving in and out of place as the location changes.  Some outdoor scenes take place inside the theater, while some others, strangely, are actually filmed outside.  Personally, I found this very distracting and it made it difficult for me to get engaged in the story.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. I started playing it with my granddaughter while staying with her for awhile.  NOW I am hooked, even take it with me to play before I go to sleep.
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|Very interesting and compelling movie.  Seeing the survivors at the end really made for a dramatic ending. I highly recommend.
B00BMVTTJ4|2.0|Ruined a perfectly good story with cheesy costumes/markup, poor action, and terrible special effects. The should should be ashamed of themselves.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|I won't spend too much time rehashing what others have already said in the top reviews, but this is an excellent series that you need to catch up on if you have never seen it.<br /><br />This Blu-ray edition has a digital copy and actually comes with a dragon egg! (A fake one of course). The bonus features have a few extras that you won't find on HBO Go.<br /><br />This is an \\"adult\\" show on HBO, so just a warning to parents, it would probably have at least an R rating if it were a movie, as there is nudity and plenty of gore.
B000FBJG04|5.0|This is an amazing telling of the story Easy Company of the 101st Airborne, who were at Normandy through the capture of the Eagle's Nest. The randomness of death and wounding of central characters leads to a complete war-weariness by the end of that endless engagement and conflict. Superbly well done!!!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The HD picture animation and graphics were absolutely amazing. Has to be one of the best picture fims that I have watched in a very long time. Usually when movies have excellent animation they lack content, but this movie didn't. The story line and movie itself was excellent and very inspirational. Highly recommend this movie!
B002X3V4P2|4.0|Like many people, I heard of Enya from a Pure Moods cd I bought back in the nineties.<br />This is the first time I actually bought a collection of her music and I was not disappointed.<br />Her sound is soothing and original. My only regret is not buying any of her music any sooner.
B00BHMF578|3.0|The storyline and plot was good, but the movie itself was rather boring until about 3/4 of the way through. Towards the end of the movie it began to gain some momentum and became more suspensful and fun to watch.  Also, this movie was supposed to be based on a true story and if you know history you will know that there isn't much truth behind the plot. Overall, I liked the movie but I would not watch it a second time. It was okay to see once.
B009HOU672|3.0|Jascha Heifetz remarked that he listens to contemporary music to let the composer know that: please, don't write it anymore. It's ok a to try new things, but please don't destroy a perfect piece of &#34;architecture&#34;...I consider l listened to a piece of experimental music.<br />The cd box was missing a piece. Amazon, please check merchant before shipping, I think there some of us buying cd instead of digital on ipod is to collect them. Of course Amazon has good customer service policies, but it's time consuming to return things.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Loved this movie and thought it had an excellent story line behind it. Gerard Butler does an excellent job with his character as a mentor.  The movie is very heartwarming, inspiring, and touching. It accomplishes these characteristics without being cheesy or boring. It is a great movie for the whole family.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a fun game and certainly can be addictive.  The graphics are excellent.  I recommend this to anyone wanting to have a good time!
B0095P3ULC|2.0|I've enjoyed the previous two movies, this one though felt forced and disjointed. It was too focused on following the same formula of down and out hero with hot girlfriend. The storyline had potential, but it was almost like they tried to stick too much movie in too little time. There were times I had trouble even following the plot until I realized what the writers were attempting to portray. That's unusual for me.<br /><br />If you just want explosions and hot chicks, good movie. If you are expecting something akin to the previous two, look elsewhere.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|Toms are honestly one of the most comfy pairs of shoes I have ever owned! I haven't purchased any recently but I've had one set for a year and they're still good. As long as you take care of them they will last!
0670023329|5.0|I read this phenomenal book in a matter of days while I nursed my son, and I debated every few pages whether or not I'd recommend it for anyone else to read. To call it \\"shocking\\" doesn't even do it justice.<br /><br />Shin Dong-Hyuk is the only known North Korean born in a total control prison camp to escape. His parents were political prisoners, for reasons that are vague at best, so Shin was condemned to a life of beatings, starvation, and hard labor. The depiction of his life in the prison camp is provocative, graphic, and completely heartbreaking. He knew nothing of the outside world and had no desire to escape until another prisoner (who had traveled outside North Korea) told him of the delicious food beyond the barbed wire. Driven by a life of chronic hunger, Shin equated freedom with an abundance of grilled meat. It was enough for him to make a miraculously successful escape to freedom.<br /><br />I won't give away the ending, as there isn't really one. He's just a few years older than I am now. I was hoping his story would feel redeemed. And while he's doing much better than he was in the camps, the truth is that Shin will work through what he experienced for the rest of his life. There are no easy answers to what he went through. No quick cure for the nightmares that were his entire life.<br /><br />I knew so little about North Korea until reading this, and now I'm fascinated (and will probably read a few more books about it). The brainwashing, the abuse, the malnutrition... it's almost unbelievable. This book urges the reader to care. And that, in my opinion, is a great start. A lot can happen when a group of people start to care. I know that now, whenever I hear of North Korea on the news, I will see Shin's face in my mind and be prompted to pray for the hundreds of thousands just like him.<br /><br />So I guess I'm going to have to recommend this book, but not without a very strong warning. It is graphic. It is heartbreaking and mind boggling in every way. If you are human, it will change you. Looking at my own life, I've never been more thankful for the comparatively lavish amounts of food in my pantry or a soft bed to sleep on or the palpable love I feel from my family. I've never been more grateful for my country's government and military that protect my freedom.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I have enjoyed everything that Nathan Fillion has been in.  This cast combination is simply fun to watch.  I will own all of them so I can re-watch them often.  My absolute favorite show.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|This movie was cute.  I have 2 small children (and one infant).  It wasn't fabulous, but the kids understood it.  It made for a fun family movie night.
B008I3RARW|4.0|racing games are good, this one is one of them. My son likes playing it on the phone and tablet.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't normally write reviews but I got to say, best $4 I've spent this week. I read loads and this was one of the best, read it in a day, got to find more books by miss Hoover.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|strange environment in this story.  Couldn't really get a clear direction in this story.  Seemed brutal and sad of individuals
B008VO3PA4|5.0|Loved this little book. Will order a couplebto give as gifts to othervcat lovers in my life. Guess I might ask Elvis and Bugg if they have any dog friends they'd like to gift.
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|My family loves this show and even dvrs it.  They have started over at the beginning seeing things they missed before.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app! It is fun and easy to use.  I cant wait to level up and play more.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|My husband and sons are huge fans of the show.  They love watching this and catching what they missed the first time around.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is like temple run but so much funnier and has characters that are crazy and cool!!!!so much fun
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I just wish they had this for reg computers if I had on reg computer would be easy for me when I am at home so I don't have to pull out my pad
140053271X|5.0|i love it but i can not figure out how to delete books after I read them.  i guess i need to get back in the manual but it is very long and hard to get through
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|So far so good. no complaints. seems to work great with my kindle fire hd. now I am going back to shop some more :-)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a pretty nice app. I would recommend it to anyone. Very life like movements and doesn't seem to lag at all.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|now I can read all my crochet magazines on my kindle fire hd! awesome! no more being stuck in front of mt computer because my printer is out of ink all I have to do is open it on my kindle..... not to mention it is portable and saves on ink  and is paperless!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|To me the hint button took a long time to download, and I felt the hidden items were almost too hard to find.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This book is an eye opener to people of all ages. Deserves a place with Dairy of a Young Girl and The boy is the striped pajamas.
B004JNCOQM|4.0|The movie was very good from the viewpoint of being able to learn more about this man of history and what really drove him. I would recommend this movie to all WWII history buffs.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I like the whole idea of mythology. This book builds up a lot suspense and nee d you wanting more. This book is a series so, if you like this keep your eyes out for others.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great game with the ability to level up quickly and advance in the game without having to buy your advancement. Great game, easy to learn and pick up on, worth the price (free)!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's one of my favorite books of all time it has action gore and the type of stuff I like
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Doctor speak and medical terms complicate the message about his trip to a heaven. But it wasn't the Real Heaven folks.  We are not here on earth to learn and progress as the doctor is telling you in the book, but to find Jesus and to tell others about HIM.  We are sinners and need Jesus.  Dr Alexander is an atheist and doesn't believe in sin or the need to repent of his/your sins or even the need to believe in Jesus.  He didn't see the angel of Heaven but the angel of death.  Beware all you readers...read John 3:16 instead.  We all are awaiting the Real Jesus when He returns.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read the first book and didn't enjoy it but this one was as awesome. The ending is such a twist and well it's amazing. READ THIS BOOK NOW!
0553381407|5.0|An enlighting and informative book, it has given me the insight as to why I had such a disfunctional childhood with the hope of becoming a functional and independent adult.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|I just bought Sofia the First:  Once Upon a Princess.  I have not seen this one yet. I was introduced to Sofia by my 4 year old granddaughter.  She can't get enough of Sofia.  Is a huge fan. She knows the songs by heart, and even twirls around like Sofia. The storyline is such a great teaching tool to show kindness, generosity, thoughtfulness,you can do anything you put your mind to . For parents and grandparents alike you can't go wrong owning everything Sofia.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I'm one of those guys who feels rap and hip hop has been on a steady decline since the 70's and 80's.  Somewhere along the line, poignant social commentary gave way to boats and hoes.  This album brings it all back with thoughtful lyrics, great beats, and well-written compositions.  At $4, you can't get more bang for your bucks.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Really great story told between events of World War II and now from multiple perspectives. Good mystery with a surprising end twist. Sometimes these stories with multiple perspectives don't synch well -- this one did.
1449410243|3.0|There were a couple of entertaining comics in there, but the stuff on Oatmeal's website is far more entertaining.  Meh.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I don't often give a 5 to a book, but this one deserves it. Having traveled in India, I'm intrigued by its culture and this portrays an aspect of it of which I was not aware. The intertwining of lives from India and from America wove a wonderful story. It's also a great woman's story of those that can't have children and those that have to give them up for adoption. Really well done.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|When watching several eps in a row, you get a feel for the cinematic pacing, and the storyline flows much better. Waiting a week for the next episode makes them a little disjointed.
B008LA7RM0|5.0|What can I say? A pop masterpiece, especially if you sequence &#34;Wouldn't it Be Nice&#34;, &#34;Don't Talk&#34;, &#34;Let's Go Away for a While&#34;, &#34;God Only Knows&#34;, &#34;I Just Wasn't Made for These Times&#34;, &#34;Pet Sounds&#34;, and &#34;Caroline, No&#34;. I would compare &#34;Caroline, No&#34; in particular to Bacharach's and David's and Warwick's &#34;Anyone Who Had a Heart&#34;: as good as the genre gets.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I travel a lot and oviously carry my Kindle all around. This case has protected it very efficiently and it's very practical to deal with.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|I am not a toddler nor do I have a toddler so I can't comment on how well a kid would like this game. However from a design stand point the app is very solid with cute graphics, basic music and a pretty good job with the voice over work.<br /><br />However as others have said the catapillar has very little to do with this game other than he sits at the bottom of the screen. And the app is very repetitive. Each level seems to be never ending but just starts over after 10 or so screens into it. I think it would be better if the child knew when that level was over and could move on to another level or repeat it of their own free will rather than just going on forever.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is such a great game. Having choices to play on creative and survival is great. Also the Peaceful Mode is cool if you are buliding a house. The Nether world and Mobs are also add difficulty to the game. I have been playing for a long time and it is amazing I can play for hours.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Very good! Except for the scene where the child plays with a gun while the adults ignore him. Children are watching!
0525478817|5.0|John green is awesome...nothing else to say! ( I have to write 12 words worth of something to submit this)&#60; There is it is!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|My preconception of this book is that it would be yet another one of those abused woman books (think Nicolas Sparks, Julia Roberts film, etc etc), a topic that has been very done. Yes it was that, but it was presented in a very unique way using time lines. We learn about Catherine and how she was victimized, through dated entries in the present and flashbacks to the early 2000's.<br /><br />What happens in the book is generally not a surprise, and it is a compliment to the author that she was able to build such high suspense even though you know what is doomed to happen. It was kind of like watching a train wreck in slow motion, you cannot look away. Catherine has OCD due to her experiences, and the descriptions of her behaviour patterns are detailed and exhausting to read. Her fear and hopelessness can be felt as you are reading. At times very sexy/graphic and also very violent and scary, you come to understand how she became the way that she is. It is also a tale of redemption as you can see how the human spirit prevails.<br /><br />I could not put this one down. Its a very good little jumper! You must read it. I look forward to more from this talented author.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can get lost for hours on this app absolutely love it. very easy to use<br /> and lots of wonderful ideas.
1616550414|5.0|Impresionante libro, totalmente recomendado. Edición muy cuidada, materiales del libro de muy buena calidad, muy completo y a todo color.
1595825045|5.0|Coming much faster than expected, this book is beautiful and detailed.<br />I nominate for all fans of the series.<br />A unique experience.
1451695195|5.0|Very interesting point of view in this book.  Well written and a fairly quick read.  The bottom line is obvious, but the trip to that line is amazing.  Highly recommend.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Let's of drama, action and unexpected twists in this series makes it excellent in general.<br /><br />Add in some Zombies and it's over the top great!!  ;)
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This movie has something for everyone. Great story of finding yourself and following your heart for kids. Lots of great jokes for the older folks. Mostly light hearted, feel good movie. Sort of predictable, but what do you expect from a kids animated movie. Great movie for family or date night. The monsters really show their own personality. wonderful cast (voice) choices.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This second book was better than the first only because it was good all the way through. Looking forward to starting the 3rd book.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|Every song is unique but shows Bruno's flare and style. Its a great listen in the car or around the house. Good sample of different music styles/genres. Not too pop or anything else. Its Just right. Its one of the few CDs I can listen to from begining to end with out skipping a song or two.
B005PK553C|5.0|Loved it. Watched second season on tv. Never watched the first season. It was great! Love Jessica Lange. Really liked that a lot of the actors from first season played in second season.
B008OE05IG|5.0|Puts you right in the middle of Tokyo with an amazing group of people you really are interested in. Get some take out sushi and watch this movie otherwise you will be dying to have some by the time it's over!!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Although I felt like Atlantis got off to a rocky start, once they found their stride the show became incredibly addicting. I definitely recommend this series to any Stargate SG-1 fans out there!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is a continuation of the storyline from the first two seasons. Acting is excellant, and the costumes are fantastic. Very historical feeling, you really get involved with the characters.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|Well it was certainly a weird movie, and an interestign swiope at L Ron Hubbard. A slice of life film
B007712XAU|5.0|Historical accuracy is right on. Acting is superb. You really understand what people actually lived thru in that period. Well worth the time invested.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I have gotten to know and like the main characters. There is a little love story going on as well as the crime plot and the bizarre.
B00B935SUY|4.0|Got a little sappy and contrived toward the end.  But it's a great documentary and a very cool story with some excellent interviews from some awesome musicians.  Very well done, production, directing, go Grohl.
B001JNNE64|5.0|There's no need to review the merits of this movie. The only question is whether 1. you like the longer Director's Cut, which is the version included in this Blu-Ray Book, and 2. if it's worth upgrading from DVD to Blu-ray.<br /><br />Taking the second question first -yes! The BD is an improvement over the DVD, and the Blu-Ray Book packaging is a nice upgrade as well.<br /><br />As far as the theatrical release v the Director's Cut, I like the DC. Some think it makes the movie too long. I don't. It reminds me of the old joke told in orchestral circles: an American attends a concert in Vienna. When asked how he liked it, he answers, \\"it was OK...maybe a little on the long side.\\" To which his Viennese friend replies, \\"I see. But you must realize that here in Vienna, we love music.\\"<br /><br />Recommended.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|everyone has seen it, and I'm sure there are some great reviews so I don't really need to add anything here.
B001UHOWXI|2.0|Detail-wise and depth-of-image-wise, this Blu-Ray improves on the Silver Anniversary Edition DVD that I previously owned (and which I gave to my sister after acquiring the BD). I wasn't happy about losing the extra feature on Frank Capra that was on the DVD, but life is short.<br /><br />This BD generally cleans up the picture we've all seen over the years into a steadier and more-detailed version. However, there are MAJOR problems with the transfer: DNR has been over-employed which adds a glassy look to certain scenes. There's a really bad vertical scratch mark running along the right edge of the film that starts when the now-repentant George Bailey returns to the bridge to pray for help. That scratch runs pretty much through the final 9 minutes of the film, and it's impossible to ignore as one tries to watch the movie as the scratch flickers and changes position. I don't remember that scratch in previous issues, so it's REALLY disappointing to see it on the BD. It's also disappointing to read so many 5-star reviews of this BD, none of which mention these glaring and obvious faults. One wonders if the reviewers even bothered to watch the BD before reviewing.<br /><br />As others have noted, this package includes both the original B&W and the colorized versions of the film. The scratch I mentioned is very visible in the colorized version as well, though the digital manipulation is less stark in the colorized version than the original B&W.<br /><br />I suppose this is the BD version we're stuck with until someone at Paramount decides to spruce up the film correctly...which is to say, fix the damn picture! To date, Paramount's efforts have been restricted to gussying up the packaging: first, in 2009, with the BD case wrapped in a sparkling O-ring, and then again in 2011, when they threw in an ornament and some other useless crap in a \\"Gift Box\\" edition. Both versions include the problematic 2009 mastering discussed herein.<br /><br />You can't tell a book by it's cover, nor - apparently - the transfer of a well-known and -beloved film from the outside packaging.<br /><br />Disappointing, to say the least.r, nor - apparently - the transfer of a well-known and -beloved film from the outside packaging.<br /><br />Disappointing, to say the least.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|Could've been cool.  Pretty much a botched horror film with nothing original. And I'm someone who likes bad horror and sci-fi.  All you need is a good story and I'm a push-over.  Save your time here.  Go check out Pandorum... an older bad sci-fi horror with an awesome story line.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I've removed Avast! from all my computers and mobile devices and installed AVG on all my devices.  We love its improved user interface and user-friendly controls.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love it. The game is SO fun breeding new dragons hoping you will get a rare one. But its for all ages. The only bad thing is recently my dragonvale is having trouble loading otherwise good.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|The story was rather transparent as to where it was going early on in the story.  Likeable characters and some warm slices of atmosphere, but a bit thin.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|It is way better than the 4 game and is the best until 6 comes out. Its fun for everyone.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|There are a couple of clunkers (I'm talking specifically about \\"Aliens of London\\" and \\"World War Three\\"), but a great way for the series to return overall. I chalk it up to Russell T. Davies still getting his feet under him in terms of tone, because for the most part it's outstanding, and by the end of the series I was absolutely blown away.<br /><br />If you haven't watched the new Doctor Who, and you want to see what all the fuss is about, this is a great way to do it. And it just keeps getting better from here!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Love the update and some extra features with it, only problem is I'm having troubles playing the player vs player.
B001TH16DI|5.0|These iconic films get the full treatment, from great audio to cool commentary tracks, whether they're beloved (Wrath of Khan, The Undiscovered Country) or reviled (The Final Frontier). The purchase was worth it just for the aforementioned commentaries.
B006C1DH92|3.0|more directed for younger kids and there really wasn't a challenge since the fruit moved slower then the normal Fruit Ninja.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|this was a very fun game but on the level that you enter the date from The photo the date was incorrect 02141976 kept coming up but the date on the photo was 02021976 so itwould not continue an let me finish the game. very frustrating!!!!!!
B005FISBTO|5.0|Had to play catch up to be ready to next/last season.  So sad it is ending, love the series.  Thank you - oh and transaction was great.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|1 of the best movies I've ever seen!!!<br /><br />Wonderful, so well done.<br /><br />No wonder they got the awards they did.<br /><br />Well worth it!!!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|O ma gowd I just wanna play this till I die!  I highly recomend this is u like sharks, or youre cool, or just plane smart

B00AGKH6D8|4.0|Joe Bonamassa ?<br />Joe is just a part of the whole here which has done in other projects.<br /><br />Actually this has a lot of the 70's fusion feel, well done, very enjoyable.
B005C0DHEY|1.0|This \\"documentary\\" is a piece of fiction that belongs in the sci fy category.<br />Please, get some perspective after watching this. It's total sensationalism and not fact based. These are the opinions of some people but not scientific evidence.<br />There are people who have worked in the oil and gas fields for 10-20 and more years, don't you think they'd be the ones with the worst health effects of them all?<br />I want to hear more from workers who deal with this stuff directly day in and out and what they have to say about this. Actual uninterrupted, undubbed interviews, not articles where they can twist words around to suit their own agenda.<br />Please google Fracknation and get behind the scenes of Gasland.<br />What I would love to see in the future of this all too important industry are environmentalists and the  oil and gas companies to sit together at the same table and hammer out a plan we can all live with. But keep away those communistic invronmental terrorists who want to listen to nothing and no one. We need people who are smart, educated and have a heart for this country and it's people, who have their heads on straight and listen to facts  and evidence not fiction!!! Where have all the level headed, honest to goodness environmentalists gone?<br />Academy Award for best fiction.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|good fun even w toddler he likes feeding horse but needs more things to do and the waiting time kinda sux!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Husband likes history and he liked it a lot as second book of trilogy, but it did not interest me.
B000S1L7IU|4.0|Very captivating as Clive Cussler always is.<br /><br />I was constantly at the edge of my seat during the reading of this novel.

1476719071|5.0|Seriously, Look out book boys because Travis Maddox snuck his way to the top of the book boyfriend list. I love me a bad boy and ladies they don't get any badder than Travis. I'm not kidding! What? You need proof?<br /><br />1. Gorgeous bod (Okay not proof I just want to point that out..)<br /><br />2. Said body is covered in tattoos (You had me at tattoos...)<br /><br />3. He's a total man-whore, no for real a girl leaving his apartment said she'd leave her number on the counter. His response was \\"Eh...don't worry about it.\\" (Okay that doesn't look good but still...)<br /><br />4. He rides a Harley! (I'm not big on bikes but isn't this like bad boy requirement? Yep.)<br /><br />5. He's in an underground fight club type thing. And he hasn't lost yet! Come on!! You're killing me here. (Hella sexy...)<br /><br />All that and yet, hell yes I still have it bad for Travis Maddox *Sigh* And seriously...who'd have thought Pigeon would be like one of the cutest nicknames ever. I swear if I had heard it anywhere else I'd have probably been thinking you're joking right? But nope it's adorable as all hell.<br /><br />Oh wait there's more to the book than Travis... Sorry I got a bit distracted and obsessive. Anyway!<br /><br />This freakin' book turned me into a total wreck. Honestly, I thought something might be wrong with me. If I wasn't grinning like an idiot with every page I read, then I was either down right angry or on the verge of tears/bawling like an insane woman. I had to put it down and walk away a few times because parts of it just tore me apart and I couldn't take anymore. It's just. That. Good.<br /><br />It has a very well rounded out cast of characters. Besides Travis and Abby, I simply adored America and Shepley. They were a perfect addition and I grew to care for them just about as much as Travis and Abby. They had many funny, comic relief type moments as well as some drama of their own.<br /><br />This book has so many ups and downs and it's worth every minute of the emotional ride that it takes you on. One I will most definitely be reading over and over through the years to come.te of the emotional ride that it takes you on.

B0009MAP90|5.0|My brother was friends with Bob at this stage of his career. He got to watch the rocket take off. So, this album has personal meaning for me. Beyond that, though, this album is a harbinger of the fast-paced changes he was about to unleash. Far from being a sonorous-voiced campus kid playing folk songs, Bob plays them like he's riding a flaming Triumph down aback country highway. His delivery is forceful, clear, direct, and sure. And while only containing two original songs on the album, his re-interpretation of the genre was explosive and incandescent. Not a bad way to charge out the gate.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Argo is a fast paced thriller, but never mindless. Affleck generates the kind of sustained suspense that one associates with a caper movie, which in one sense it is. Set during the Iranian Hostage Crisis, Argo is the story of just one of the many exploits of Tony Mendez, CIA master of disguise. Mendez (Affleck) is charged with creating a cover story for the seven hostages that have managed to escape from the American Embassy during the first few minutes of the crisis. He must spirit them out of Iran under the noses of the regime, and Affleck manages to hold the tension for most of the film. Like ZDT, the final half hour is a series of synchronized moves, each of which must work. Argo is so different from [[ASIN:B00BF11STU Zero Dark Thirty]] that comparisons are useless. Both are top notch, both are true stories, and both deserve to be seen at least once.<br /><br />Anyone interested in the true story written by Mendez himself should check out his book: [[ASIN:0060957913 The Master of Disguise: My Secret Life in the CIA]]. The full story of Argo is the subject of a fascinating book: [[ASIN:0147509734 Argo: How the CIA and Hollywood Pulled Off the Most Audacious Rescue in History]]. Both are worth the time, especially for CIA and espionage buffs.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Great deal!  There should be more songs on here...he could have cut the crap we hadn't really heard and replaced it with &#34;Red Strokes&#34; and things like that.  But for the money these are the songs you probably want to listen to.  Not sure who is sitting down and watching the DVD...Garth is ugly when he sings. If this man was on Itunes this little package would cost you about 50 bucks...so be glad he won't go there.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy this. It;s easy at first and then it can become quite difficult.<br />My only real complaint is that the three free &#34;hints&#34; inadvertantly evaporated. I don't know how. I did not use them on purpose, I will not pay for more.
B00756GKBA|5.0|I assume that I was afraid of being a bad album of this girl. But after listening to it I realized that It is another amazing Madonna´s album. I recommmend to all her fans. You won´t regret.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is the testing point of Ethan's and Lena's relationship. They have to face many different challenges, so they may be together again. The ending is marvelous, and the whole book is filled with adventure. I couldn't put the book down.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|This movie defined Hitchcock and Cary Grant as true masters of cinema.  The thriller was born with the wide screen shots and the seething undertones in the script. Always a great movie to watch whenever.
B00BPLDCVM|1.0|OK, I know there are people who will really enjoy this album, but so much of the energy and excitement from the show comes from Bear McCreary's score.  You can't help but feel the hair on the back of your neck stand up on end once the opening titles start, and the instrumental music throughout the rest of the series is fantastic as well.  The fact that this album doesn't contain ANY of that music is extremely disappointing.  It's just a random collection of songs that they decided to use in the show.  Considering it's less than 29 minutes long, they could have easily included a large portion of the score from the first 2 seasons on this disc.  The reason why they refuse to do so escapes me.<br /><br />Now, to be fair, there will probably be a good deal of people who will listen to and enjoy this album.  When I listen to the songs on it, however, all I'm left with is an emptiness inside, as if someone reached into my chest and pulled out my heart (and than ate it).
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|I'm very happy they decided to adapt this book into three films - it allows the filmmakers to fill in storylines from other Tolkien works that wouldn't merit their own films (like the Necromancer)!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|GoT is one of the best series on TV, this DVD set is definitely wortth viewing. The commentaries are informational and entertaining, and the show itself is very well made.

B00BEIN9VO|5.0|I can't begin to say how much I love this album. Songs are fantastic, and it's nice to hear some JT through a good turntable setup. Rich sound. Amazing album.
1608862771|4.0|If you like this type of art, then it is a very enjoyable book... whether it is just viewing each page as an art piece or delving into the intricacies within it. I would have liked to know more information about the artist than what was provided so that is why I gave it only 4 stars. This book provoked an interest in knowing more about Matthias, but I had to get that information elsewhere.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|Can't give it any stars because it would not install on my Kindle. For free app it wasn't worth it.
B009YX02T8|4.0|I like it.  It was $1.99 deal of the day. Otherwise I would not have purchased.  I have not listened to it in it's entirety but what I've heard sounds good.
0930073193|5.0|This book is really good at explaining major issues discussed in economics in a straightforward way. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested at gaining a better understanding of economic issues, but not interested in picking up a textbook.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Since the movie was between theaters and dvd release, I picked up the book knowing nothing of the story. It was much sadder than I expected, but raw and beautiful.
B001H4R4LQ|3.0|It is a good series with a solid plot line, however Paolini is a little too descriptive at times. The series was originally meant to be a trilogy, which now I have heard Paolini is going to release a 5th book. It took Tolkien 3 semi-lengthy books to finish Lord of the Rings and he is over criticized for being too descriptive. If I could give the author advice it would be to know when to cut back the writing, and focus on the important things. By making it overly complicated he is leaving too many holes in the story line that can only be solved with another book.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|again more geared for a teenage audience - the characters were transparent and the story rambled - not pleased with ending
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A great game for house lovers! The graphics are good but the load times are a little long. The training is fun.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. I was expecting a more complicated and intense storyline, but it was pretty cut and dry. I compared it to a lighter version of Sleeping with the Enemy. I would recommend this book as a quick summer reading while by the pool.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|A powerful, powerful film that I am proud to now include in my top 5 favorite films ever list, and possibly even top 3.    An incredible visual experience (and a magical combination of characters) on screen to be sure, but the depth of allegory that this parable manages to express and finally reveal at the end into a literal concrete \\"meaning\\" is utterly poignant and only the most clueless (or darkened) soul of a person can hope to reject the value in the message being expressed here.  This isn't a preachy film at all, and its appeal is that is reaches out and touches everyone capable of being an audience to it. How important is it to understand the many ways in which a truth can be expressed? How important and vital to our understanding and growth to not dogmatize or demonize a contrary method to that truth if there be one?    I can't say any more for fear of spoiling it to the unaware concerning the details of the story (so watch it!!) - But suffice it to say that this film was one of those \\"OH S*** that's amazing\\" moments for me, at the level of experience all too rare in its potency in this industry, and one that I'm thankful to have experienced.    Truly a work of art. I can't recommend this movie highly enough!

0765325950|5.0|I think that this book is as good or better that any of the other books in the series, and I have read all of them mutiple times, except for the last one which I have been only able to read once, the rest of the family are reading it now.

B007M45PMU|5.0|If you like the Lumineers you already know that this album is going to be great and don't need anyone to tell you.  If you don't know the Lumineers, they are folk rock and their songs are very well put together. I really do recommend this album.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great product - does everything it was suppossed to and more. I highly recommend everyone who needs a calculator for the Kindle to get this free product.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|After watching season 4 I am pretty sure Chibs is my new favorite character!  The only character on this show that drives me nuts is CLAY!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|The movie was excellent, but differed significantly from the J.K. Rowling book.  In my humble opinion, the movie missed some of the best parts of the book and actually changed the plot line several times.  For example, showing that the effect of destroying a horcrux would cause both Voldemort and Harry to &#34;feel&#34; the destruction was completely ignored in the previous movies, but played a big part in the final film.  A little disappointing due to reading the books prior to the movies - to be expected in the interest of movie length, I guess. I would have prefered even a third movie to accurately capture and show the original story to what they did to &#34;complete&#34; the series on film. Overall, I still liked the movie very much, but I LOVED the books so much more.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Could not stop watching.  Finished the whole season in 3 nights! Once you start watching you won't be able to stop.
075669812X|5.0|My son, 4, can't get enough of this book!  We have had it a few months and still read/ look at pictures each night.
0345529057|5.0|So obviously this collection includes the first four books from A song of Ice and Fire. The packaging is great. and I was lucky enough to not have the printing errors that so many people have brought up. The books themselves are fantastic too, best fantasy tale I have read since Lord of the Rings.
B005QSS53U|4.0|This may not stand up to today's standards of horror, but for a trip down old school short form horror, this is pretty great. It's mostly the second story, The Raft, that keeps me coming back.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book, it was really fun to read I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read it
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Mark Wahlberg is excellent in this movie. Definately worth watching again and again. On par with Bruce Willis in the Die Hard franchise.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Great game for the cosmos lover! Very cool effects and meditative maneuvering. Hubby and I both enjoy this noncombat soft-touch game. It's like a balance game in a maze of stars. Great design!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Excellent series, great acting, great characters, and the historical setting makes this a don't miss event. This era of time was a critical staging  of what has followed and anyone who wants to know how we got to the mess we're in now only needs to study the past 100 years.
B009GEOLM4|5.0|If you're a Batman fan you'll love this movie. Follows the story line of the comic from the 90's very closely.

B007BVOEPI|5.0|This show is amazing.  The acting is superb (Tyrion Lannister for President!), and the set work and costuming is so intricate.  Notice the subtle changes in armor from region to region.  I highly recommend this series and also reading the books.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I rated this 3 stars because I downloaded it and I never use it so don't take my rating as being a bad thing.  It's just me.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This series is very entertaining.  It brings the books to life and stays pretty close to them.  There is a bit of variability from the books but sometimes this can make the surprises more exciting.  I think this is one of the best series on television right now.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this app all the time.  It's accurate and reliable.  I love how there are different things, like hourly vs next 10 days and it has the pollen counts on it.  I love it!!

B0030IIYYS|4.0|Disney and Pixar did it again. In this follow-up, we are introduced to more new characters to love and enjoy.
B009FZFONO|2.0|Many of the characters are just boring at this point, and how many graphic scenes of Zombies being killed do I need to see?  Apparently not more than the total at the end of Season 2.  I still watch it, but I think it's mainly because I've already wasted so much time on the previous episodes.  Don't plan on watching past this season.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|A perfect film where a grumpy old man warms your heart. The story will make you laugh and cry, but each character you can't help but love!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to my cousin because with lack of care for others she could really use a great message that this book is to bring she is just like the character Jack Will. This book has been the wonder of all so wonders.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|This movie is cute, adorable and an awesome film for all to watch! Disney and Pixar did an excellent job!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I have been a fan of Justin Timberlake since N'sync. I still own and listen to \\"[[ASIN:B00004NRPZ No Strings Attached]]\\". [[ASIN:B007V4QKRA Justified]] is also still in rotation in my house. I listened to [[ASIN:B001HT4YXC FutureSex/LoveSounds [Explicit] (Bonus Track)]] for an entire summer, non stop. I say this so you know that when I say this is Mr. Timberlake's best album, no question, you know that I have grounds to say it.<br /><br />Seeing as I loved \\"Suit and Tie\\" I had pretty high expectations for 20/20. Imagine my absolute delight when \\"Pusher Love Girl\\", the first track on the album, came on and floored me. Despite the fact that I have had the album on repeat since I bought it, and am listening to it as I write this, I still can't find the words to adequately describe the overall sound of this album, other that calling it damn good music.<br /><br />The average length of each song on this album is around 7:00 minutes, but don't let that frighten you. Justin worked with Timbaland, the man behind Future Sex Love Sounds. Because of this, each song has a very clear 'radio ending', letting you know when the song is about to, as I like to say, let the beat ride out. Personally, I love the longer songs, but the clear stopping points are perfect for those who like their perfection a little more bite sized.<br /><br />I love every single song on this album, but I will still list the tracks that I feel best define this album, and why I think so. \\"Pusher Love Girl\\" is the first track on the album, and is so good, I didn't hear the rest of the album for at least an hour because I kept replaying it. It is smooth, and has a great beat all at the same time. \\"Tunnel Vision\\" is the fifth track and very well could be my favorite track. The hook is so addictive, it might as well be covered in chocolate. \\"That Girl\\" aka the only reason \\"Tunnel Vision\\" isn't my clear choice for favorite song, is old school blue-eyed soul of the very best kind with a modern sound that music needs more of. \\"Blue Ocean Floor\\" is simply beautiful. Justin has always excelled at ballads, but the production along with his voice make this one of my favorite closing tracks of any album, ever.<br /><br />Music is a huge part of my life. I go to bed with ear buds in, and wake up listening to albums on my phone. It is important to me to have quality music. I am incredibly thankful that this album exists because it is now one of my top five favorite albums, ever. This one isn't going to be in heavy rotation, because that would imply that at some point I would stop listening to it, and that is something I don't think I will ever do. An instant classic and an absolute must buy.

B005IQZB14|4.0|I was interested in the days on the trail. The sights, sounds and loneliness of all the days ad nights.  Human strength and weaknesses shared with the emotions of stress, anxiety and the unknown.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I always enjoy the Mickey Haller series of books.  This one keeps up the same pace, interest and intrigue.  The subject matter made it difficult to enjoy at times. But if you're looking for a fast-paced page turner, I would recommend The Reversal.

B004M8CMVQ|3.0|I picked up Color of Magic, the book, after having somehow not reading any of Terry Pratchett's books in all this time.  It was very interesting and funny if a little weird.  Then I saw the video on Amazon.  I only watched the first episode because I haven't read the second book yet but it seemed pretty typically cheesy British sci-fi TV.  Entertaining but not quite in the same spirit as the book.
0679721037|3.0|John Hersey has written a horrific account of five survivors from the split-second the bomb exploded until their death years later. I understand the book was revised at some point to include additional information. His detail is unique but he spends considerable time describing how one of the priests transported people back and forth between the river and the evacuation area. Once you read about the trip three or four times it feels like a re-run. It was amazing to me that he was able to interview five survivors and contact them several years later. I was interested in reading more about the rescue efforts by the government and then the United States. No contingency plan on the planet could have prepared Hiroshima for the terrible death and destruction of the atomic age. I must ask myself; why did the United States drop a second bomb? Our leaders wiped out a city of nearly 400,000 people and did not even let the radioactive dust settle before dropping another one. What did the world's people learn after the first bomb? Well, we learned that two is better than one, we can build a bomb of our own and we are willing to drop one again. It is a bad sign that sane countries have a bomb but now insane contries are pursuing nuclear development. Hiroshima is a short read and I recommend the book for one reason; to remind us that atomic bombs will destroy the earth. No one wins in atomic war. Read John Hersey's book and remind yourself what happens when atomic fusion is released on flesh and bone. Pray to God that bombs are turned into plowshares.

B00371QQ0M|5.0|This is an underrated movie. It's great! I remembered seeing it, or at least commercials for it, in the early '80s. I wanted to watch the whole movie more recently. It's a difficult movie to find, but I managed to find it on here. It's a fantastic epic with a star-studded cast. It's a pity it didn't lead to sequels. At least there's this one movie to enjoy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it sooooo much,not only is it addictive but fun. There's so many things u can do with it. I recommend it to everyone. :)
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|It seems presumptuous to review anything written by Truman Capote.  People familiar with his writing love him.  People who only remember the Capote of the 70's talk show circuit find him ridiculous, or uncomfortable at best.  I admit that my initial reactions to Capote were initially based on the latter.  That squeaky, effeminate, overweight man made me cringe.  He was so stereotypical of what people assumed all homosexuals must be.<br /><br />And then I got over my bad self and read his books.<br /><br />Capote was one of those very rare writers who leave the reader feeling like they've just experienced a gorgeous piece of music.  (Virginia Woolf is the other writer that I experience in this manner.)  His best work, (and Breakfast at Tiffany's is truly among his best!), will live and haunt the reader forever.  Even his lesser work was still damn good.  Reading Capote is like falling in love, and we lucky readers get to share in this experience over and over again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool, I love it, I love how you choose a character to play with I give it 1000 stars
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is addictive! Every episode stays on my mind for weeks. it is eye, heart, mind and soul candy
B008F9E306|5.0|I'm. Huge fan of T.I.s music, but I do not make bias statements. If u decide to purchase Trouble Man by T.I., of coarse you're gonna skip to the tracks u recognise. I'm sure we all do the same, but when you're done with that start from the beginning and listen to every word, you will find that his lyrics are more of a helpful tip on life. Basically \\" learn from his mistakes in life. Now I'm not saying he ruined his life. He actually made life easier in his eyes, but the short way has many potholes. So check him out, I know you'll enjoy it.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Since Google Reader is being discontinued, I was in desperate need of a new feed reader. And then I found this! I love the sleek, clean design of it. I love how I'm able to organize things so much better. And I love most of all that it's available as a Kindle app, which is always in sync with my web Feedly. Still working out a couple kinks, but I'm looking forward to seeing how it compares long-term.
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|I was interested in seeing this movie but not enough to spend my money. I got the chance with a trial of Prime & watched it on my Kindle Fire. The movie was fine but but seems to be suited for a B-movie night. Don't get me wrong, it is fun & there is enough nudity & sex to get an R rating but nobody will ever see it as a masterpiece of cinema.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|I don't know exactly why it was bad. It just did not live up to the expectations of a Bond movie. The villain was laughable rather than villainous. The film just seemed sub-par.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I have these in VHS. When I saw the DVD price, I couldn't resist adding them to my library. Will watch every few years - just a wonderful Tolkien story so well depicted on the big screen. Most of the time, these book-to-movie attempts are such a disappointment. Not these.
B00A3AU1U6|5.0|Soft and luxurious; whimsical, cerebral and emotional. ENO. (I am adding this sentence only because Amazon says I have too few words. How appropriate for this review.)
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I had to preorder this when I saw it was coming available. Haven't watched it yet but if it is true to its &#34;sequels&#34; am sure I won't be disappointed.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I started on the TV show after the 1 1/2  seasons and wanted to be brought up to date.  Nice that you have it at hand anytime.
0800141660|5.0|An English Literature Major's Delight! That says it all. Additionally the movie  is a good visualization for any reader,  As one gets older, it's easier to follow the storyline visually and more interesting to others to appreciate in this format.
0525953728|4.0|Positives:<br />+ nothing in this book struck me as exaggerated or self-serving<br />+ the Pentagon has got to be delighted that whatever minimal philosophical reflection its soldiers are inclined to do is downloaded uncritically from the right-wing media. After all, these folks are trained to execute (in both senses of this word: 'to act' and 'to kill'), not reflect upon the possible wider consequences of their actions.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />+ the first half of the book can be profitably skipped if you are interested primarily in the raid itself. The first half contributes very little useful context to the raid.<br />+ the author never states explicitly why this book was written. Was it to correct inaccuracies in the descriptions of the raid in the media? Was it to glorify militarism in general and SEALs in particular?  Was to to ensure that bureaucrats and politicians do not take undue credit for the kill (in particular, was it to reduce Obama's ability to use the raid in his 2012 re-election campaign?)<br />+ I can understand why the Pentagon wasn't pleased with the publication of this book. Anyone who is currently a target of an American assassination squad (or expects to be in the future) would do well to read this book. This book shows clearly that there are elementary defensive measures that Bin Laden and his cohorts could have put in place that would have made the operation much more difficult to complete successfully. This isn't knowledge that the Pentagon wants widely disseminated.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|I had never seen this movie before and love that it was on amazon prime instant  video. Characters, plot, acting- all what I was craving. Lovely.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Somehow they managed to create a Bourne movie without Matt Damon, and it's ever so close to having actually worked.  They just forgot to actually write a decent script to go with it.  This movie had okay action, but little substance.  The story line was not always clear, regarding who was doing what to who and why they were doing it.
B00124BNF4|4.0|The good news (for you) is that this compilation is a great way for beginners to dive into the unique (and ingenious) mind of David Byrne and Company.<br />The bad news (for me) is I already had the albums...<br />Oh, well, as Princess Luna said, &#34;Ha, ha! The fun has been Doubled!&#34;<br />(I'll try to down the compilation into my KIndle Fire...)

1452111014|5.0|Great book!! Really get a lot of art for your dollar. Half the book is worth the price. Every world has entirely different concept art section.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A fascinating drama about an aristocratic family dealing with the changes in a post WW1 20th century. Excellent writing, acting and photography. One is drawn into the lives, ethics and emotions of the staff and the family they serve, experiencing the full range of emotions from joy to sadness and despair. This is one of the best PBS series of all time.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It does switch seamlessly between listening and reading! I can listen to it in my car and then pick up reading it where I left off.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Got this CD yesterday.  Loved the movie so to have the full soundtrack is awesome.  I purchased the Soundtrack highlights CD also but this one contains everything so it's even better.
B00846WWVM|2.0|I'm glad this was a free app.  If I had paid for it I would want a refund.  Not recommended

B0031KE9C6|3.0|I enjoyed Veronica, thought it difficult to follow the plot as it moved very quickly and left me guessing, OK
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|The movie is terrific, but the bonus features that are provided really set the stage to let you know how much was movie sory telling and how much was reality.
B008MM9630|4.0|Its a good game that you don't have to check every day. The critters are cool and most of the tasks are fun.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|a beautiful story of overcoming adversity and finding that even a potential adversary can join you when survival is at stake.
B002YDRA22|2.0|I had read the book before I saw the movie. I LOVED the book! When I learned that there was a movie about it I was so excited! I couldn't wait to see it. My brother even told me it was great. I finally got the chance to see it and was so disappointed! Maybe if I had not read the book before I saw the movie, I MAY have liked it a little, but the book was way, way, WAY better!
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|Several great songs and the rest very good.  Only had it for a few days, but so far so good.

B009NPM5Y2|5.0|Watched it not knowing much of anything about it other than Tom Cruise was in it, but much to our surprise it was a hilarious and well written.<br /><br />The cast sang their own songs and everyone did a great job. It was amazing.<br /><br />The writers did a great job of creating medleys of some of the most memorable hard rock songs from the 80's.<br /><br />We ended up buying it and watching it again the following weekend after purchasing the Extended Edition, which added a couple more scenes that gave us a nice surprise in that viewing as well.<br /><br />Great fun!
B00B1L6B4G|3.0|Nothing about this novel really stood out. The characters outside of the detective Gunther were one dimensional and most of them made to look like fools. The first part of the story lasted far longer than was necessary considering the main plot revolved around what happened in Prague. Too much of the story was utterly predictable and Kerr gave away what could have been on of the big reveals right at the start.<br />I have read better historical crime fiction and much better historical fiction. A better look at Heydrich can be found in the novel HHHH detailing his assassination. Overall this was just an average, formulaic crime novel.
B0011MRKHW|5.0|This movie was very satisfying because of Kate Blanchette's genius. Her work is exceptional. The period costuming and set designs were all well-researched
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The most fun game I have ever played.I have never thought a game could be this good.I am going to play more right now!It is so awesome adopting new horses!Everyone needs to play this game.

B00AO686MY|5.0|One of my favorites!  Very well done for Blu Ray.  Great acting, scripts and story!  Fun for the whole family.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book deals with some troubling situations and Turkey makes you think whoa somewhat is good for you. Make  you rethink how you would handle situations all while telling a love story. Here is to hoping the next book finds the couple happy at the end of their rough road.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|This was no more a James Bond movie than Saw was!  James Bond is a playboy not a troubled head case.  If you watch Goldfinger, Dr. No or Thunderball you will see they are bright and fun movies where Bond wins gets the girl. If you want to make a dark and depressing movie get your leading man don't hyjack James Bond.
B000SW4DP8|5.0|I was expecting this movie to be pretty depressing in the vein of 'Alices Ashes' but it turned out to be kind of magical and heartwarming.  A lively and artistic but poor family moves to American and struggles to survive and find a fulfilling life.<br /><br />Avoiding cliches at every turn the parents and the children are rich, fully developed characters and the story kept me riveted.  I bought this to share with friends because I like it so much.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As usual this book grabbed me from the beginning and held me all the way through. The only problem with reading Mr. King's books is being bummed when I finish it. I don't ever want them to end!
0062071017|3.0|This book has some value, but I finished it not really having a clear sense of strategy The best thing about it is it whetted my appetite to learn more. I did some research and ended up reading [[ASIN:0307886239 Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters]] which is one of the best business books I've read. It demystifies strategy and helps you recognize the confused notions we have about strategy (namely, goals are not strategies; strategies are how are you going to make your goals happen).
030758836X|5.0|This is probably the best book I've read in a year. A bit dark, but the quirky characters and dialogue kept me reading. I loved the suspense and surprise twists. It made me want to read her other two books. Very well written.
B0058DRUV6|4.0|good insights and well written, can contribute to building a career or getting more satisfaction oout of your current job
B003U4UNR8|1.0|Season 6 as a whole, but especially the finally, was a complete letdown. The way this otherwise fantastic series ended was like a punch in the face followed by a snickering laugh. I would suggest not wasting any time at all watching any of Lost as it is not worth it in the end.
0385333846|5.0|If I were stranded on a deserted island, this book is the first thing I would bring to keep my sanity. I've reread S-F half a dozen times, since I first read it five years ago. I don't think Vonnegut ever gets old.<br /><br />Besides being one of the most orignal books I have ever read, it's the prose that will suck you in. It's a cross between Tim O'Brien, Ernest Hemmingway, and Douglas Adams. The sentences are short, satirical, full of life, but not pretentious. A lot of people say that a good book is like having a conversation with the author, and that's exactly how I feel when I read Vonnegut, specifically S-F. He never talks down to the reader; he doesn't explain everything, rather he let's you make those inferences.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I have not seen the movie but heard a little about it from friends.  I always read the book first.  The writing wasn't horrible - just flat but the worst part was the personification of the MC - the book doesn't ever give a diagnosis but portrays a man with mental illness as being stupid - this is absurd as most with mental illness are highly intelligent.  My impression of the MC was Asperger's Syndrome because his behavior would fit that diagnosis but then it makes one wonder how someone this OCD and repetitive supposedly was married to an intelligent woman.  The letters ate the end of the book were unnecessary and although were supposed to trick the reader somewhat - they just didn't ring true - the MC wrote his letters well but otherwise was portrayed as an idiot.  I felt nothing for any of these characters even Tiffany who was downright mean didn't even give me a glimmer of \\"like.\\"  What I am gathering from all these reviews is that the movie was excellent but the book sucked - Quick was very lucky that his short little novel was picked up for movie-rights because otherwise it would be lost in obscurity.  I want to see the movie out of curiosity  but I will not pay to see it - already wasted a few buck on this book which was totally disappointing.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I needed a new pair of headphones that I could wear while running, and earbuds and I do not really get along.  These are perfect - lightweight, comfortable, and they fit perfectly in my ear!  I should pick up some backups for when these wear out.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is a straight forward, entrancing account of the elimination of Bin Laden in his Pakistan hideout. The author gives the reader an insiders view of the life and training received by U.S. Navy seals.  Without revealing anything I  perceived as sensitive or in need of being redacted the author gives the reader a vivid description of the details of that day when America's number one enemy was killed. This is a must read for anyone who appreciates military history and patriotic true stories. My hat is off to these fine young warriors and I sincerely thank all of them for their selfless sacrifices to ensure our continued safety and freedom.
B009NX50DM|1.0|Don't bother, we watched for about 10 minutes and turned it off.  Michael Caine has better movies available for you to watch.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Very good story line and great animation. I would recommend this movie to anyone, adult or child, as it is rather entertaining and incredibly creative.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|It is interesting that it gives you both the BluRay and DVD sets.  But I guess since HBO knows this is the most pirated show ever, they just threw in the towel, and aimed for higher distribution to promote Season 3 whch should come out soon.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Closer although probably considered to be a film about romance is much more,unlike other romantic movies this one isn't sappy or filled with cliches,it is about what happens when people in relationships meet someone they are attracted too and choose to act on it.I didn't really like any of the characters in this film but feel that it is a damn good movie (Which is based on a play),i especially found one scene between Julia Roberts & Clive Owen to be very powerful when she fills him in on an affair she has been having with someone for a year without him being aware of it..If you haven't seen this film i highly recommend it the story is interesting and the acting in my opinion is top notch...Just be aware of what you're going into.

B00338QENI|3.0|I enjoyed this book and found it hard to believe sometimes that there was all of this cell research going on behind the scenes.  But, it was pretty scientific and I found that part of the book was slow.

B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I loved the cinematography and amazing special effects of this movie. Rich color and beautiful settings. I just wish I had seen it in 3D.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I love this show... although I didn't realize at the time I was purchasing just one episode so that sucked...
B00005QB42|5.0|Deva Premal has a gorgeous voice and her music is equally as beautiful. Her songs are repeated mantras accompanied by excellent musicians. I use them for yoga but also just to relax. Sometimes even on a long drive! Highly recommend.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|Once I started reading this book, I couldnt put it down.  It just is so intriguing.  I do love flowers but that is not why the story grabbed me.  It is a story about a foster child.  You just cant predict what happens.  Very good.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Love Ed Oneil he totally shines in this sitcom. Crazy show that truly depicts how wrong things can go in modern life. Everyone in the show is funny they do an amazing job making you laugh.

B00BHMETKC|4.0|Interesting subject/story.<br />Relatively nicely done.<br />Fairly realistic. Interesting characters.<br />It was probably the most inspired academy award given in recent years.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|It is hard to write up a review on this series without falling into a whole dictionary's worth of superlative complimentary adjectives.  The cast has melded into a smooth working group that let the individual members stretch and show off their abilities with each new episode.  While they all started out as relative unknowns, today, each would be hard pressed to walk down the street without recognition.  Adding new talents including one previously beloved child star grown up to a very talented and lovely lady, the cast has expanded from five to double that number.<br /><br />The basic story line is growing, season by season as the characters find new situations within their worlds and grow in their personal experiences, as well as add to the cast.  The premise of the show is still young super intelligent university scientists dealing with the rest of us normal folk that populate the world at large.  The comedy angle continuously crops up as our genius' run into everyday situations within their interpersonal relationships with each other and the rest of their immediate world.  With the main characters of Leonard and Sheldon firmly ensconced in relationships, their immediate friends, Howard and Raj, show the limits of relationships with Howard having married Bernadette and Raj still searching for the love of his life.<br /><br />I look forward to each new episode just to see where and how the guys and their paramours relate to one another and the rest of the world.  Hopefully the network and cast members continue their happy relationship to keep new episodes rolling out for us all.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a series that I didn't want to end. There is an immense amount of talent in the cast. The characters are complex and interesting. The storyline, though not earth-shaking, captures the imagination from the start. These are people I would like to know in real life. The story is heartwarming and uplifting. It's not that no one has problems, but that they care enough to resolve problems and to look out for each other. They appreciate what they have in their families and communities - something that is direly missing in our contemporary real life too often.<br /><br />If you enjoy Downton Abbey or Jane Austen's stories, you'll surely spend some happy moments watching this series.
0486409511|5.0|This is an art, like any art form there are tools that help you complete your design.

B002NVTSGQ|5.0|So new and honest.......and really funny.  They have opened the 'gay' envelope on TV and done it with class and style<br /><br />They should sweep the Emmy list this year.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|What an awesome bunch of warriors!  This book was so informative about the process of choosing and making SEALS and what they do.  I'm 100% behind them whatever they do.  Nothing makes me madder than the bleeding heart liberals telling these guys to fight with one hand tied behind their backs.  Leave them alone and let them fight without those ROE hanging around their necks!  My love, respect and thanks to Marcus, the SEALS, and all who serve in our military.
B004UPANGM|4.0|I saw this warped little gem at a bar in Yonkers, NY back in the early 1990's. I can tell you 3 things that happened during its run that night:<br /><br />1) Not a single person left until it was over<br />2) Every person there was scared sober by the time it was over<br />3) Every person there needed a drink after it was over<br /><br />The movie has a deceptively simple setup: a group of young adults decides to crash a 'cabin-in-the-woods' one of them knows about. They believe the owners almost never come there, making it perfect for a weekend of uninterrupted debauchery.<br />However, they find a book, and tape recorder in the abandoned cabin...<br />The book is the notorious and legendary 'Necromicon', the invention and lynchpin of H.P. Lovecraft's mad cosmos of horror. The tape recording is of the owner...a scientist who was studying the book, with lethal results.<br /><br />It seems that the hapless scientist read a portion of the book, which allowed evil spirits to invade cadavers...who came by to make a midnight snack of the good doc. Our young protagonists stupidly play the doc's recording of him reading the passage...and, the spirit/zombies come for them.<br /><br />While this may sound like the 'same-old, same-old', it rises above it all because of two unique talents:<br /><br />1) Director Sam Raimi, whose love of horror, breathtakingly kinetic camera work and penchant for black humor mine consistent laughs out of the most dire of situations<br /><br />2) The great character-actor Bruce Campbell, whose comic-book-hero visage/physique make him believable as the guy who can fight off these evil spirits (even with a chain saw grafted onto the stump of his wrist; and, whose natural goofiness make him the perfect vessel to channel Raimi's insane black humor (&#34;...shop smart...shop S-Mart!&#34;).<br /><br />Bottom line: often imitated, never equaled...this movie is frightening, gory (to the point of deliberate excess) imaginative, blackly funny and flat-outunforgettable. If you consider yourself any kind of a horror-movie fan, 'Evil Dead 2' has to be on your 'must-watch' list. Boo!
B0050PYNO4|5.0|It's not too often a movie comes along that has me laughing from beginning to ending. The characters are quirky and amusing as well as villainously delightful.  There is a plentiful amount of pleasing satire and Paul is an absolutely lovable character. I haven't viewed the entire blu ray for picture quality as I saw the movie elsewhere but the random samplings I took look good.
B00BP4SJKI|4.0|I first saw 'Peter Pan' in the 1960's, during one of its period re-releases by Disney; and remembered it a a pretty good \\"...kid's film...\\"<br /><br />I recently re-visited this movie, under the prodding of my 11 year-old daughter; and, I am grateful to her for pushing me into it. 'Peter Pan' features beautiful animation, well-choreographed scenes of fight and flight, inspired voice-acting and memorable songs. All of this supports a surprisingly funny and insightful tale of the dangers of either never growing up...or, growing up too much.<br /><br />Katherine Beaumont ('Alice In Wonderland') is beguiling as teenage Wendy Darling; whose childhood infatuation with tales of Peter Pan develop into a relatable (if very 1950's) teen crush. Bobby Driscoll, who was a well-known Disney child star, turns in a completely winning performance as Peter Pan. He captures all the bravado, hubris, good humor, pettiness, generosity and pure sense-of-fun that run chock-a-block through all teenage boys. The characterization of Tinkerbell (insanely jealous of Wendy and possessive of Peter) creates a very believable teen-age triangle; and, some welcome pungency to offset Disney's penchant for treacle. However, the prize goes to Hans Conried in the twin roles of Mr. Darling (Wendy's veddy, veddy British father), and Peter's nemesis: Captain James Hook. As Hook, Conried creates a truly great villain: charming, scheming, ferocious, vengeful, cunning and (where the hungry crocodile is concerned) hysterically nervous.<br /><br />Comments about the 'Indian' scenes are justified...but, not to the extent that Politically Correct critics condemn. The song: \\"What makes the red man, red\\" is classic (i.e. insensitive and stereotypical) Hollywood 'injun' stuff. That said, Candy Candido's floor-scraping vocals as 'Big Chief' are a pure hoot; and, should be taken in that spirit.<br /><br />Bottom line: 'Peter Pan' is one of Disney's most completely realized and satisfying movies. Its fun, insightful, exciting, speaks equally well to kids, teens and adults and does so without the sugary wallowing that came to epitomize subsequent Disney animation. Watch it, and smile.citing, speaks equally well to kids, teens and adults and does so without the sugary wallowing that came to epitomize subsequent Disney animation. Watch it, and smile.
B009IF8CH6|3.0|Ok, so we all knew that at the end of Season 5, there was definitely going to be a continuing season.<br /><br />What I love:<br />I loved how they tried to continue where they left off, and I have to congratulate the crew on that part. Jokes were definitely new, funny, genuine, exciting and just tickles my funny bone. There was almost a theme towards every episode and the story line came together to create a congruent sense. Obviously after 6 years, the nerds have their own sort of group, and moving on with the lives. Some having steady girlfriends, to getting married, and poor Raj is still trying to get a girl.<br /><br />What I don't love:<br />Everything was great and genuinely humorous in the first 12 episodes until &#34;The Bakersfield Expedition&#34; and then the following episodes were just plain. I'm sorry to say this, but having been a huge follower of this show, I feel the writers were just getting bored of it and decided to have the episodes run with corny and lame thought jokes. It was like they wanted to just run out of time just so they could get the season over with. I hope if they decided to have a Season 7, the stories would revolve more about their Nerdy lives and their attempt to socialize with the rest of the outside world. And please keep the jokes fresh!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I'm a heavy sleeper, so I always have to have a loud alarm clock to wake me up.  I usually have an alarm set on my iphone, but due to a series of unfortunate events, I have not been able to access some features on my phone.... long story.  So I downloaded Alarm Clock Xtreme Free & I've really enjoyed using it!  You can change the color scheme, there are dozens of alarm tones to choose from, and you can set multiple alarms to go off each day without having to turn them on or off!  This is perfect, for me :D
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|A lovely film, famously (or infamously) only part 1 of 3 of Tolkein's book \\"The Hobbit\\" but ends in a good place in the story.<br /><br />In this first part of the tale, we're introduced to Bilbo Baggins (played by Martin Freeman), a content \\"half-ling\\" living in his half-underground hut at the edge of The Shire in Tolkein's Middle Earth and into this safe, contently predictable world where \\"nothing unexpected ever happens\\" enters the Wizard Gandalf (played by Ian McKellen) with an invitation to join him and a company of Dwarves (also \\"little people\\") on \\"An Adventure.\\"  Generally risk-adverse Bilbo asks: \\"Will I come back?\\"  Gandalf answers: \\"I can't guarantee that.  And if you do come back, you won't come back the same.\\"<br /><br />SO BILBO HAS TO CHOOSE between staying home (in his half buried home to begin with) or take a chance on an Adventure that will certainly change him.<br /><br />WHAT A GREAT PARABLE ABOUT THE GREAT DECISIONS WE MAKE IN LIFE!

B0070YDOT8|4.0|I like this Casino because I am playing with their money! They give you more money for each consecutive day that you play. They also give you a bonus if you play for 4 hours or more. I like the Word Poker and Blackjack. Most of the time the game works great,, but sometimes the server is slow, and it doesn't register your plays in time. Other times it kicks you out in the middle of a hand. It will usually continue to play your hand for you. Other than the glitches, this game is fun, and you don't have to worry about going bankrupt!

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A Higher Call is an amazing book and a must read for people who study World War II, love people who fought in World War II or just want a terrific read.  Adam Makos  found a higher calling for himself in this work.  Not only has he told a powerful story that preserves history; he has also done what great historians do for us.  He has made a work that future generations can use to examine their consciences. I would compare it to The Face of Battle and A Bridge too Far.  Mr. Makos is a young man and I look forward to his next work.  As a person who grew up listening to the \\"greastest generation\\" and a teacher who has taught the Iliad many times, I think he has heard and retold the stories that warriors and the people who love them have grappled  with from the beginning of time.  I would hope it will be required reading at the military academies.  Suzanne Lay Linworth Publishing Reviewer.
B008MZPVP4|5.0|Good stuff as expected from Down. Bluesy sludge riffage and solid grooves. Not a bit of filler here to be sure.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Just my opinion of course, but I really enjoyed the performances from Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Erza Miller. This is a high school teen drama dealing with love, loss, and trying to fit in, but it was different enough to be a great film. Watch it and maybe you'll see what I mean.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Before I start this out I'd like to warn you it's going to be long, heartfelt, and very emotional. I first read Colleen's work (Slammed and Point of Retreat) last summer at my Dad's. I had just been really getting back into reading then and they definitely were a part of starting my blog and joining the reading community online. I loved them so, so much and her writing blew me away but with Hopeless I know for a fact I can't even find the words to describe how truly amazing this work of art is. It definitely shot Colleen up my list of authors to the tippy top with Ellen Hopkins. Reading is usually an escape for me but sometimes I'll find a rare book that I take something from, usually a lesson or piece of advice that helps me in life and gives me hope. Contrary to this books title it left me the opposite, full of hope. I've been reading almost nothing but NA Contemporary lately and it has gotten really old but Hopeless was so unique and different. It was a refreshing read and just what I needed.<br /><br />I fell in love with Sky the minute she let me into her head, she is so much like me and so different at the same time. I promise you if she was real I'd be her best friend, her outlook on life and others around her is amazing. The fact that she doesn't let stupid bashing high school drama heads get to her and the fact that she is herself and doesn't care what others think is admirable to say the least. I love her relationship with her best friend Six, who is equally amazing. The banter between them and easy going humor filled relationship is so perfect, it was an element in this book that made me love it so much more. It's been said a million times and it will be said a million more, Dean Holder is one hot hunk of man that is hard not to love. Every girl says Holder is hers but really he's Sky and I envy her but at the same time I'm so happy she found him. The more I read these books the higher my expectation of my future husband gets. His feelings for Sky and how passionate he is about everything in his life is awesome for lack of a better word. He was so fun to get to know and I'm excited to see more of him in Losing Hope, the companion to Hopeless. To explain what goes on in this book is to give it all away, so I can't do that. If anyone were to talk about this book in detail it would ruin it. The secret, the big bomb that's always waiting to drop in these books is so unique and unexpected. Colleen truly made Hopeless her own and something new, I applaud her for that. Sky and Holder's relationship is undeniably one of my all time favorite love stories ever and it will remain that way for forever. The love they feel for each other feels so true and real that it's hard not to wish you had your own Holder. They're connection is so blatantly obvious and they make me believe in soul mates and happily ever afters. When s*** really hit the fan they didn't abandon each other, they didn't push each other away which is so common, they stuck together and helped each other through it. This wasn't just another one of those typical relationships you see in almost every NA Contemporary novel, it was unique and perfect and so amazing.<br /><br />The ending of this book blew me away, I wasn't expecting what Colleen dropped in my lap as she was ripping my heart out and throwing it to the wolves. If I had expected such an emotional crazy story I would have grabbed myself some tissues and chocolate, holed up in my room, and then ignored everyone until I was done with it. Instead I found myself sobbing on the couch trying to explain to my mother why exactly I was such an emotional mess. The ending is so bittersweet for me, Colleen manages to twist so many lives and little details together in one book it's impossible to know what's coming next. In the end I was so sad for so many people but so full of hope that life can go no. Even though this is a fictional story their is so much truth within this book. Life is complete s*** sometimes and sometimes you don't feel like you can make it through but you can and you shouldn't ever forget that because even when there's nothing but ugly surrounding you, remember that there's always a tiny bit of beauty in the world. To say that this is a must read in my book is an understatement of the century. If you don't read this book and give it a try, you're insane. Thank you Colleen, for leaving me breathless and sharing yet another work of art neatly tucked in-between pages for me to devour. I will be patiently waiting for you to craft another piece of perfection for me to read.<br /><br />Favorite Quotes<br /><br />\\"It's real, Six. You can't get mad at a real ending. Some of them are ugly. It's the fake happily ever afters that should piss you off.\\" ~ Sky (page 107)<br /><br />\\"I want your first kiss to be the best first kiss in the history of first kisses.\\" ~ Holder (page 150)<br /><br />\\"I'm not going to wish for a perfect life. The things that knock you down in life are tests, forcing you to make a  choice between giving in and remaining on the ground or wiping the dirt off and standing up even taller than you did before you were knocked down.\\" ~ Sky (page 475)<br /><br />Plus so many more but my list would be endless, pretty sure this is one of my most highlighted ebooks!feel like you can make it through but you can and you shouldn't ever forget that because even when there's nothing but ugly surrounding you, remember that there's always a tiny bit of beauty in the world.

B008YKGQR4|4.0|I was not very happy with how Facebook was working on my new Kindle 8.9 HD Fire.  All is well now that that I have this App installed.
B0002KQNJU|2.0|This is not a very good movie, in fact I couldn't finish watching it.  It had a few fairly good parts in the beginning but when it became apparent that I was going to have to force myself to finish it, I did myself a favor and turned it off.  Sharon Tate was probably underrated as an actress but I guess she worked with the material she had.  I have always been fascinated with her after the infamous murders, but I must say this was not a very good movie.

B007REV4YI|4.0|As an aficianado of the James Bond film series, one of the ongoing problems has been the absence of high quality directors and scriptwriters to create more compelling films and to re-invent the characters. At the inception of the series, Terence Young created a template for the Bond character, adding dimensions that were not found in the Ian Fleming books. Young, with the active participation of Sean Connery, decided how Bond would look, the style and manner of his clothing, they injected the elements of tongue in cheek humor the came to define the series, and Young , with production designer Ken Adam, created the distinctive look of the films, with sleek sets and special effects. When the producers, Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson decided to re-boot the series in 2006, by casting Daniel Craig as a more rough hewn, realistic Bond, they also made a conscious effort to bring the films back to their roots. After the success of Casino Royale, expectations for the series were raised, however, after the disappointment of Quantum Of Solace, a somber, poorly directed film, there was cause for concern regarding the future of the Bond series. The producers uncharacteristically, decided to hire an Oscar winning director, Sam Mendes [American Beauty, Road To Perdition], and a highly regarded screenwriiter, John Logan, to helm the new Bond film, Skyfall. The results are spectacular. The new film is beautifully shot; the cinematography by Roger Deakins was nominated for an Oscar, the script is excellent, the direction and pacing is brisk and Mendes clearly has a genuine affinity for the Bond character and a desire to make a high quality film. The casting of Javier Bardem as Silva, a rogue agent who has a vendetta against Judi Dench's M is inspired; the expansion of Dench's character gives Dench an opportunity to fully display her considerable talents and the addition of a new \\"Q\\", who is a computer expert and a new Moneypenny, Naomie Harris, who is well cast, gives the film aboost. The supporting roles are beautifully executed, with kudos to Ralph Fiennes, and Albert Finney, who is almost unrecognizable as the caretaker of the Scottish estate where Bond was raised and where the climax of the film takes place. [Wouldn't it have been a treat to have had Connery himself portray the role] There are nostalgic touches, such as the introduction of the original Aston Martin DB5 that was driven by Bond in Goldfinger and Thunderball, with the same license plates and the presentation of a new Walther PPK to Craig's Bond, which responds only to his grip. There is a conscious effort by Mendes and Logan to highlight the backstory of Bond's childhood and parents, and to develop the personal relationship between Bond and M. As everyone now is aware, the film was a critical and a commercial success, earning in excess of a billion dollars between domestic and international receipts. While it is frustrating that Mendes was unable to commit to direct the next Bond film, hopefully, the producers will bring in a comparable director for the next project and endeavor to maintain the same high level of excellence for the Bond series.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|At the time when I bought this mouse, it was a bargain at $40. At first I was skeptical, as I had never heard of an Anker mouse before, just bigger brands like Razer, Logitech, Coolermaster, Corsair, Steelseries, and Thermaltake. But I decided to take the \\"risk\\" given how cheap it was, its high dpi, and its abundance of good Amazon reviews (reviews elsewhere were scarce).<br /><br />I couldn't be happier with it. I got this mouse to replace the Razer Imperator that had crapped out on me, and this is better in every way. The 8000 DPI sensor seems perfect (read: no problems to speak of), the mouse glides well, and it is easy/comfortable to hold thanks to its shape, good materials, and rubber thumb rest (I use a fingertip grip, but it looks like palm would work well also). The three thumb buttons are actually easy to press and well-placed unlike the thumb buttons on Razer mice I've used in the past (DeathAdder and Imperator). Four little LEDs next to the left mouse button indicate which of 4 DPI profiles is being used.<br /><br />The mouse wheel makes a light clicking noise when scrolled a notch, or a slightly louder/crisper clicking noise when pressed. Actually pressing the mouse button does not require much effort (which was one of the downsides about the Logitech G9x if I recall). The additional button past the scroll wheel is easy to press, but I rebound it to middle-click as I have nothing to make it do right now.<br /><br />It's worth mentioning that the scroll wheel took a little getting used to as it felt farther up (closer to the palm) than my Imperator and other mice, causing me to unsuccessfully attempt scrolling the middle button I mentioned above. I got over this learning curve in a few days though, and now I don't mind it all.<br /><br />I have no complaints about the software. It doesn't strike me as bloated or bulky, and all options are easy to find. You can make each of up to 4 DPI profiles range from anywhere up to 8000 DPI, and you can rebound everybutton on the mouse to any other mouse button, a key press, a macro, or a common function (like copy/paste). For power users, I recommend using AutoHotKey if you want to give the additional buttons more complex functionality. The software lets you change the color and \\"breathing\\" speed of the Anker logo, but it also lets you turn off that light or breathing completely if you wish. Oddly, you can't change the scroll wheel's light, which will stay forever blue and on.<br /><br />I'm very happy I bought this mouse, and for $40, it blows the competition out of the water.<br /><br />(I tend to play a lot of games such as Team Fortress 2, Dishonored, Borderlands 2, and Left 4 Dead 2. I personally have the mouse set to switch between 1000 and 4000 DPI.)

B003NRYMZQ|4.0|I started Torchwood after catching up on Doctor Who. Torchwood Series 1 is good although not as good as Doctor Who. For a show about hunting down aliens I don't think there are actually enough aliens in it.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Don't know why there's so many negative views on \\"The Hobbit\\", personally I liked it. The film stuck to 85% of the book with the occasional tweak here and there, but overall it was accurate. The actors are excellent (Gandalfs Back!), landscape is awesome, and the action scenes really gave \\"The Hobbit\\" a new meaning of epicness. Anywho all the blah..blah..blah aside. This is a great movie and I'm super stoked for the next one. For those who read the book this is a movie you don't want to miss.
B00942X8PY|2.0|NOthing to really celebrate here. It's not awful, it just isn't very entertaining. I would not pay any money for this.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Everything about this purchase was outstanding! The packaging, the arrival time, and the general service was above and beyond my expectations!
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Good unique game play. Music is relaxing.<br /><br />I would call it an action puzzler, although it is often best to go slowly even though it is an action game.
B001A3GSFW|5.0|I bought the album for my son who absolutely loved it! I was letting him go through the tracks and listen to them(since this was his first real album) I know it's not suitable for younger kids by today's standards but my first album was G 'n' R appetite for destruction. When I was 6. This is a great Album. I went through it with him and he likes it more then I do so. 5 stars.
1451695195|5.0|Very well written book.  THe author is a trained scientist and addresses some of the arguments against such an experience.  I was also struck by the impact his experience had on his life upon his &#34;reawakening&#34;.  Whether you believe in an afterlife or not, this is well worth reading and considering.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The product was delivered in a timely manner, in great condition as it always is when amazon is the seller.<br />The movie itself is incredible. I love this movie and consider it the best of the Daniel Craig as Bond, movies.
B00881VLCE|5.0|It's great for adults and kids that like puzzles. The background music is soothing.<br />I love the conveinence of being able to take it everywhere I go unlike board puzzles. It's FUN!!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Absolutely adore this film. The bluray is top-notch. The part that most impressed me though is that those stupid ads that always play on many of my Blurays and DVDs only play on the first run for this one (especially good because they have two Taken 2 trailers on the same damn disk. What the hell?)
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|I have read 3 or 4 of the Harry Hole mysteries. Jo Nesbo is one of my favorite authors now. Harry is like a cross between Wallender and Harry Bosch. Another brilliant but disturbed detective residing in Oslo, Norway.  I don't know if I am getting better at solving the mystery or 'The Snowman' was too predictable, but I knew the culprit a long way off. However it was still a worthwhile read and suspenseful all the way through. It was very well written (and translated?).
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Very challenging and entertaining. It is definitely worth the money. The pictures are lovely and the  graphics are great. Good game.
B001JU4S44|3.0|The slow motion and special effects are fun by themselves, but I expected Mission Impossible to follow the pattern of the TV series. By that I mean to have some obstacles that required intelligence and nifty gadgets to defeat. The obstacles in this movie required speed and explosions--no thought. The plot required no thought at all either. One dimensional characters.
0739337270|5.0|I decided the get the audio book version for this tale. I'm so glad I did. It's an excellent story, engrossing and made all the better by the most animated reading by Allan Corduner. I have never enjoyed a book more on audio. Five stars for both the book and especially the reader.<br /><br />Looking this review over it is utterly glowing - I promise I don't know this guy from Adam - but if you get this book in the audio version you will be bowled over!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Too bad I do not have HBO because I will have to wait until it's available on Amazon to watch Season 3 ... love the persoanlities and interweaving story-lines. The character development is great, especially like the way they seamlessly introduce new characters! Definitely a great show to watch on HBO or when available on Amazon!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book is great at giving you an understanding of how habits control our lives, how they are developed and things you can do to change your habits.  You'll also learn how the military, businesses, schools and others can utilize peoples' habits.
B009K72G8I|4.0|This is the best season of Clone Wars yet.  While there are a few silly episodes the tone of this season is darker and gives a real sense of the oncoming darkness of the great Empire.
0345803485|2.0|I couldn't get through it, after the sex stuff. was way to girly for me, but my wife cant put it down.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched the third season and was so impressed, I went back and watched the first two. I find it takes me away from the hustle and bustle of today's workd.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loved it! Had a hard time putting this book down 😊 I wish there were more books out there like this one!
0316056898|5.0|Okay, I can't *actually* see Tina from my house.  Or maybe I can.  At least as much as Sarah Palin can see Russia from *her* house.<br /><br />Tina Fey's first comedic book of memoirs was very entertaining, insightful, and humorous.  She has such a dry, sarcastic wit that, while I find her funny, not everyone probably does.  She's never hurtful, though, at least not towards anyone besides herself.  It takes a true comedian to be able to laugh at himself/herself.  And Tina does an exceptional job in this book, even if it is undeserving.<br /><br />What I liked best about this book is discovering Tina's roots (not those gray hairs that she covers up, but where she comes from and how she got to where she is today).  She's very humble and, fortunately for her, her efforts paid off.<br /><br />Before landing a writing gig on Saturday Night Live in 1997, Tina was doing improv at Second City in Chicago.  This excited me because I actually visited Second City for a show in early 1997 and now it makes me wonder if I saw her perform before she became famous.  I guess I'll never know...  And I hope she didn't s-u-c-k at the show I attended.<br /><br />I also learned from Tina in this book about the scar on her face, which I never noticed before or read anything about.  Where have I been?  No worries.  I'm sure the experience humbled her even more and she's a much better person because of it, so the person who did it can s-u-c-k it (in the words of [[ASIN:B000XGUWUO Kathy Griffin]]).  She's still a beautiful person, regardless.<br /><br />Each chapter in the book is about some story or event in Tina's life, the best for me being before her [[ASIN:B000RBA6CO 30 Rock]] days.  These were the most humorous and insightful into what makes Tina tick, although the 30 Rock stories provide some interesting behind-the-scenes information, as do the SNL stories.<br /><br />I hope Tina continues to offer these books of wisdom and can come up with some other interesting and humorous stories of her life before becoming famous.  They're inspiring for us wannabe writers.f her life before becoming famous.  They're inspiring for us wannabe writers.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|Something needs to be done about the bad editing and spelling mistakes. Awesome story none the less, a read worthy of my time.
B008A4NGZE|5.0|All beautiful songs. I wish I could understand Spanish better. Very pleasant young artist. I am listening many times on the road.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I find myself playing this more than Sudoku. I find it mentally stimulating and enjoyable. I have not had any problems running this on my Kindle Fire.
0785162348|5.0|This book shows the concept to designs of different parts of the movie.  As an amateur artists I've had fun playing with the designs and making my own and challenging my daughter to come up with her own.  The artwork is incredible, and amazing to look at where some of the designs started and finished as.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|the show continues to show the nature of human beings even among the dead. Great show, great look at the psyche
0785153322|5.0|My daughter and I thanks to the tv show FACE OFF have been drawing and sculpting our own super heroes and animals, (plus the creative bad guy that comes from our imagination), and thanks to these books you are shown the character from different angles and made it easier to explain to her how to develop her own.  Aside from that the artwork is incredible, marvel only has great artist and its fun to see my daughter inspired by great artist and drive her to do her own cause of them.
B003E74B24|5.0|Short and sweet autobiography of Gorden Ramsay. It reads well and does give you a glimpse into the man's life, attitude and ambition.
0823015033|5.0|Thanks to the syfy show FACE OFF my daughter has asked me to help her design her own ideas through sculpting.  I've always been good with pencil and paper but sculpting is new.  Through Miss Dewey and her beginners book, we've made several heroes and villains and I gotta tell you, its easier than you think.  Follow the walk through in the book a couple of times and you'll see what I mean.  This has opened a whole new world of art for us and its a blast.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|This cinematic movie is gorgeous, most of the movie is beautiful to watch. It does make you think and that is always good. However, the universalism tone is quaint, but unrealistic. Also it just does not conclude well.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|I have tried four or five times to install this app , it will not install on kindle fire.  Please fix it... Would give it higher rating if I could play.
B002XWXPC8|4.0|A classic 80's comedy with lots of great one liners and very funny moments. I highly recommended giving it a try.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is very fun to play with. It fee like I'm really interacting with a real horse, also it's good for children to learn responsibility.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Bocelli is back, and better than ever. The music took me back to Italy, and Bocelli's voice is a treasure.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Very deep... I like the the message. We can reshape and reframe things from our oast to better serve us now and in the future.
B00A4OALL0|4.0|The big buzz surrounding this cd is obvious and makes sense. This quartet is now a classic. When one considers the time it took Wayne to own such a stable band (think of Trane who had his own in the early 60s), the success is deserved. One won't compare Shorter with Coltrane of course, but one can measure the depth of a band when it lasts. Last night, I was talking to Rudresh Mahanthappa, a remarkable alto sax player, and I was a bit upset when he told me that maybe he had another project for the forthcoming years with a different line-up... I may have misunderstood, but if it's true, it's sad. The longer a band works, the better it gets (a group lasting for 4-6 years seem to me a good thing). Wayne Shorter's is one a kind (over ten years). Not to be missed. To me, \\"Pegasus\\" is the highlight of this recording.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have enjoyed this.  I like reading each night.  I never thought I would like taking the time to read the bibly each night
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read it in one day.  I loved the smaltzy story and the Eagles in the background.  I experienced my own apart time episode again and was glad it was over.  I am also a silver linings believer because no matter what, things always work out.
B000002GOZ|3.0|I know 8-10 Bryan Adams Songs and this is definitely missing a big majority of the hits (All for Love, When You Love a Women, Everything I Do, etc.)
B00AN0KBJC|2.0|Season 2 was a huge let down. Nothing very much happened. Or at least the pacing was such that it seemed like nothing happened.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Loved the story and how the author mixed the present with ancient Egypt.  Awesome! This is a must read book!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The actors make this one of the best shows on TV - they are real and believable!  It is a great combination of crime, suspense and humor.
B004PGNB1K|2.0|Very dissapointed.  Mostly a story about school, wanted more interesting action to happen.  It was few and far between.  Whenever he got into the action the story just ignited and was fantastic but it was so hum drum in between.  Shall not be reading any of his other novels.
B006OAB432|5.0|This is a heavy record.  The record sleeve is a plastic material and the first thing I thought of after pulling it out of the jacket was that the record felt solid.  It also sounds great too to complaints there.
B0000025T6|4.0|I have to be in the mood. But this is honest, no frills bare bones stuff. No one does it like Bruce.
B00B1OWEVC|4.0|Everything Trent puts out is good. That being said I wish he sung more then back up vocals. The music itself is very good and NINish.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Not bad as I thought it was going to be. After watching it, I actually liked it enough to say that Oliver Stone still has the edge of story telling.
B0049A9BSY|4.0|It wasn't as good as the first one but still really good in its own rite. Definitely had its great moments
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|A good come back for Bond!!! Love the back story of Money Penny and how the old Bond is coming back!!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I probably use this app the most because I can sync notes anytime and access them from all my devices! The developers always keep adding new features too.
0385751532|5.0|I loved this book.  A little boy who doesn't know anything about the war except for what he hears at home; cannot realize the consequences of his actions.  The friendship between the two boys is poignant.  I think John Boyne did an excellent job looking through the eyes of a nine year old boy.  I highly recommend this book and have done so several times.
0385344333|4.0|I like it. It has good characters, excitement. Lots of action!  I am always a loyal fan to Jack Reacher series.
0688014291|5.0|Good read, you can wrap this up in less than 30 minutes.<br />Highly recommend reading this book if you are managing a team.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|One of my favorite albums from the sixties. have listened to it several  Times and love to sing along !  Luv it
1594487154|4.0|I still recommend this book but I would have to say I enjoyed several of Pink's other works a little more.  I appreciated the perspective of course but I think there is a little more to the whole \\"science of selling\\" that I had anticipated.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of the best series we have watched on PBS. Although soap operaish in the tightly woven plots, it gives us exposure to people of a time who spoke well, lived well, and whose lives were based on integrity rather than personal gain. We are trying to catch up to season 4, but I know I will miss being able to watch these episodes 2 or 3 at a time once we have finished season 3. i highly recommend this series. Also the streaming went very well. Our HD reception was of the highest quality.
0374275637|5.0|This is a solid work.  It is a bit \\"content heavy\\" and packed with info, but certainly worth the read.  You will certainly find many of the other top sellers citing this work.
B009CF7JDU|4.0|The bad guys are bad, the kids are goof offs, and the antics hilarious. Be sure you watch it with your kids, so they know you already know the pranks and how to make sure they aren't pulling the same stunts! (Or don't let them know you've seen it and let them wonder how you found them out so easily! Ha!) Full of fun and extreme silliness, some humor you see coming a long ways off but some may catch you off guard. Be prepared to explain to your kids some things they did or didn't have back in the day, but it can make your own teen years more real (if you are of the same age) and is a good starting point for some great conversations that will let your children see you as more than just someone who has always been middle aged.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|My daughter enjoyed it.  Some language and suggestive conversation but cute. Laugh out loud funny.  Great for girls in middle school.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This book is great! It has some humor and lots of great tips. Even though I  14 years old I love running and someday hope to run an ultra!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Ma-hinge meets rubics cube.  Play at your own pace or speed mode,  Great for beating boredom. I love this game.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Hate the bundle.<br /><br />I wish I had bought them individually. On the Kindle 3g and Kindle Fire, you'll get page numbers through the first book but once that's finished all you'll get is a % completion.<br /><br />Even though I'm approximately 70 pages from the end of book 3 (Looked the chapter up online), my status currently reads: 73% - page 674 of 674. Location 50092 of 68661.<br /><br />On the kindle there is marker at the bottom that shows the distance to the end of the book supposedly but on my other devices, (iPhone / Nexus 7) It's a guessing game as to how far along you are visually which I find irritating.<br /><br />So 4 / 5 stars for the content / story as it's fantastic thus far but if you're like me and like to know your status / progression through a book, buy them individually for a few dollars more.
1577312082|5.0|This cd has changed my life and will yours too!!! Search no more for what we all are looking for-our purpose. Don't miss this opportunity to reward yourself to this simple solution NOW!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This is a really great game. It has a great storyline. It has great graphics. It is great fun to play. It does &quot;crash&quot; sometimes, BUT, it reloads itslf, right back to where you left off. The enjoyment cancels that small inconvience out. It is really a beautiful game. I love mystery novels, and this game reminds me of a mystery unfolding onscreen. I give it SIX stars. I can't wait to get started on the second &quot;installment&quot;.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|What a cool app!  Very easy to use and super-useful.  I bought it for documenting How To screen-capture videos at work, but found I couldn't connect to my work laptop b/c my Android device where the ST2 app is running can't successfully negotiate a PPTP VPN connection.  Not great, Android.  When I've been able to work around the VPN situation, the app itself has been absolutely fantastic.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Worlds can not explain how great this movie is. I've seen the film three times and it still as good as the first time.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|This was a nice touching album from Jeff Lynne of ELO fame. In this album he takes a shot at playing his favorite songs growing up that had inspired him and his music. A lot of the songs I had never heard of but I found them beautiful. In the albums booklet Jeff Lynne talks about the songs he picked and why he picked them. The worst part of this album is that it is kind of short but it is so enjoyable that it doesn't bother me to just listen to it replay. I suggest this album for Jeff Lynne fans or fans of older style music. If you are a casual fan I suggest you listen to the samples to see if it is something you like.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Great story, amazing actors, all for less than $5 a rental. This is truly a good film, it comes highly recommended.
B000EYK2GE|5.0|After years of being a major George Harrison fan, I had never heard of this meeting or album. So when I saw it, I had to get it. I was not disappointed by what I received. This album features the talents of several music legends, mainly focuses on the late great Carl Perkins a true Rockabilly master. Though out the album he is plays some of his classics and other legends join in. Some of these legends are the late George Harrison, Ringo Star, and the guitar God Eric Clapton. If you are a fan of Rockabilly I highly suggest this album for you. If you are a fan of anyone featured in this album I still highly suggest this album for you.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|For not being HD, it is really hard to tell the difference. The picture was clear most of the time, and the show is amazing!
B00007KWHG|5.0|If you enjoy American 60's music this is a must have for you. Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons have a lot of iconic hits. This collection gives you all of those and some you may not be as familiar with. As someone who only knew a few of their songs going into getting this album I was very happy to hear the ones I had never heard and enjoyed them. My recommendation of this CD is to only get it if you have an interest in the band. It is a great way to start and let you decide if you want to dive deeper into more of their music.
B00AYB20KI|1.0|This movie is your typical low grade Hollywood film. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy, it would be too cruel a punishment.
6305922756|5.0|This is Spinal Tap is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. The movie follows the factitious band Spinal Tap on their US tour in the style of a documentary. The only problem is the bands not as popular as they once had been. Much of their appeal  hasn't lasted in the \\"modern day\\" (the film was made in the 80s). The comedy of the movie is more subtle and relies mainly on the bands denial of their current popularity, and them trying to regain their fame for their early years. The movie also relies heavy on band cliches from the sixties on. The deleted scenes on here double the size of the movie and I just as funny as the main movie. I highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy more subtle and visual comedies. If you are more into \\"in your face\\" humor or dirty/potty humor, you will probably not enjoy this movie very much.
B00005JNQS|5.0|My son wanted this movie. I was happy to find it so affordable. The quality of the movie is good and my son loves it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is a great read and, unfortunately, too relevant. Highly recommend especially for Jack Ryan fans.  Junior is a pretty good fill in.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|The most impressive part of the movie was that most of these guys are age 60 or above and are in amazing shape for some of the action sequences.  If you're looking for a movie with all the action greats in one film, this is one to watch.  If you're looking for a movie with accurate details and 100% believability...it won't be it.<br /><br />Still entertaining but took off a star for 'slightly cheesy.'
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I thought it was to be s'more spiral story and it wasn't . Otherwise I liked it. And I would read it again.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book so much,I went to see the movie the next day. Of course as always the novel was much better.This is my third Nicholas Sparks book,and I can say now I'm truly hooked.Well worth the read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is the best show on television right now.... Amazing cast, storyline and the make up is AMAZING......
6305291500|4.0|I blame this movie for making me wish I were a mermaid from age 5-9. It's been almost 30 years since I saw it so watching with adult eyes, I was slightly confused. We are never told what makes Madison the Mermaid so magical, why a kiss from her allows Allen to breathe underwater (and how he swims without his shoes coming off!), why Madison only has 5 days on land, what spell would make it impossible for her to return to sea after the 5th day, whether she bathes without completely emerging herself in water which turns her legs to mertail, how she is able to breathe on land, how Massachusetts suddenly spawned all that coral reef, where Madison's family is or if she is the only merperson of the Cape Cod waters, the true value of her necklace that allows her to purchase a city fountain, how she is so super intelligent that she can learn English from television in under 8 hours, etc. Admittedly, I'm greatly over-thinking this silly 80s movie, which is fun in its ridiculousness ... although not as many laughs as should be with names like John Candy and Eugene Levy. Still, it's a good time.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|Absoluut een geweldig boek. Boeiend mooi geschreven. Het is blijkbaar het slot van twee eerdere boeken die ik dus nog moet lezen,
B00406O7YK|2.0|Would not play past first 10 minutes of movie!!!! Tried to play it several times and it just kept playing ONLY the first 10 mintes of movie. TALK ABOUT FRUSTRATING.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I loved this game and find it challenging.  Lots of fun and even the grandkids like it, so suitable for all ages.
B0088W6IMQ|2.0|It's NOT the TV SERIES.  We love the series.  IT'S THE PRODUCT.  It is not all HD.  The beginning was and it was nice and clear on our HDTV.  But then, after watching a few of the shows, it wasn't HD anymore and had a really poor picture.  Someone needs to correct this so that ALL the shows are HD and just not here and there.
B001NFNFIK|5.0|This shipped Fast and the Movie was really good and full of surprises. I will have to see what other movies they have produced.<br />There was lots of action and mystery and no boring perts to it.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Love this game, very soothing way to disconnect after a stressful day, you can speed it up, or slow it down. The concept, graphics and music are all excellent.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great game for all ages.  The ability to change the board and the numbering is genius; it prevents memorizing certain moves and it truly tests ones ability to stategize against the others.  My husband and I started playing at our 28 year old son's request.  Our friends enjoy it and when our boys are in town, it is something we all enjoy playing together.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|After hearing about Chris Kyle's untimely tragic death I was interested in knowing more about him  Unfortunately this book is so poorly written it was difficult to stay interested in the story.  A heroic soldier as Chris deserves a better book to document his life.<br />I don't know what the editors were thinking... reading level must be fourth grade.  It was a struggle to finish the book, the poor writing style was very distracting.<br />I have to say I appreciate people like Chris who are willing to place their lives on the line in service of their country.  His personal character and beliefs portrayed in the book is not of a person I would like or identify with.  Regardless of my personal views, I thank him for his service.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once again Nicholas. Sparks has stole my heart. It was a love story and suspense novel in one. I really loved it.
B0058YPL66|5.0|A friend got me hooked on this serial. However, in watching it on the TV, due to the many scene changes and time jumps cut by commercials, it is often hard to follow what is happening. With the DVD, without all the commercial breaks, it is a lot easier to see how the story plays out.<br />Season one really introduces you to the various characters and sets the basis for the plot line. Watching it again on DVD, I often felt like I was watching a new story as I finally got to see how all the changes fit together. If you like the show, you will love the DVD.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|This is an amazing and fantastic movie and I wish I could have given this 5 stars but the audio was very poor. The acting, storyline and plot were great and deserve 5 stars but the audio quality was poor and I had a hard time hearing the actors speaking.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I can fit 3 lenses and at least two camera bodies in this bad, along with countless gadgets and cloths and tripods and cords and such.  Great buy. I'll be an Amazon Store Brand convert if they keep this up.  No problems with zippers or padding at all.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|this is the only TV show I have ever watched that I can get completly caught up in, all others I knit or read and watch at the same time but this one I just completly get lost in liek I normally do a good book. My 12 year old daughter loves it too and has actually got a few shows ahead of me in season 3
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is very exiting and the graphics are outstanding you can do competitions and care for your horse!!!!this is an awesome game and good luck with this awesome game
B005LAIIHG|3.0|unbelievable at best. I would not recommend this to anyone another Hollywood flop that is not believable or worth watching
B002ZG99QS|5.0|I loved the original Tron, so I had to buy the sequel. Totally worth it! The special effects are amazing, the soundtrack is also pretty sweet
B005PK56TA|5.0|Very clever! If you like suspense, horror movies, this is the series for you! Can't wait to see the next season!
B002RVCD0U|5.0|i love all the terminator movies, so i had to add this one to my collection. it is definitely worth buying
B00008EY7H|5.0|This is your typical Cirque du Soleil show, which is to say, Amazing! So much acrobatics and amazing performances! I recommend this!
1939416019|1.0|After seeing all of the five star reviews for this work I felt compelled to read it.  I'm now convinced they're contrived.  The constant and repeated misuse of words and phrases (e.g. \\"solo plexus\\" where \\"solar plexus\\" is intended, \\"site\\" where \\"sight\\" was meant, \\"far and few between\\" when \\"few and far between\\" is the idiom), the absent character development, the lack of believable risk to the main character (he effortlessly kills un-killable monsters), and the predictable plot twists make this book a significant waste of the short time it takes to read it.  The most painful parts of reading the story were the character interactions.  Fantasy fiction is often hard to suspend disbelief for.  This lowers the bar a lot.  The main character inspires emotional reactions in other characters instantly regardless of scenario.  I couldn't recommend this story to anyone.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I ENJOYED THIS BOOK ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUELY SAD. THE FAMILIES ARE EASY TO RELATE TO. tHIS IS SUCH A CONCERNING ISSUE IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW
B00AYCOUOG|5.0|This is an absolute gem of an album start to finish. It's obvious that a ton of thought went into the music and lyrics. Sometimes when I see a very negative review claiming that the reviewer had to \\"stop listening halfway through\\" or some such thing, I just have to assume that person is telling the truth and really did only listen to half the album before writing their review. That's too bad, because given a full listen this album stands up to the rest of the Suede catalog quite nicely. I love the music, lyrics, production and just about everything about this album. It's a wonderful comeback from a great band and I hope they tour the States behind it. I'll be there!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I like it!<br />Being complete saves you the time of collecting.<br />These are the best mysteries.<br />The more you read the more you want to read.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I;ve akways enjoyed playing UNO (the card game) with my grandsons.  They really get competitive and I always lose to them.  This new app is a lot better because you can play 1 to 4 people.  It's nice having the app know the rules - grandsons make them up as it fits them.  I win at this game!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very heart wrenching story with a better ending...hoping nothing like this ever comes to fruition.  You need to read all three books to get the whole story.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|One of my new favorites! It's a definite must see. I've seen it twice already.<br />The charaters, story and the camera work is amazing.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|OK, it got technical at times, and the ending could have stretched out a little longer, but all in all, I loved the book. Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, something would happen.  The authors sense of humor was second to none, almost like listening to Rodney Dangerfield . I look forward to reading more books from Mr. Weir. Thank you Sir for a thoroughly entertaining story!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|According to the product page, the kindle edition \\"contains real page numbers.\\"  I have a kindle paperwhite and I don't see any page numbers.  I skipped a chapter in just to make sure and they haven't registered yet.  (I haven't started reading it yet, so I gave if five stars to give Sanderson the benefit of the doubt)

And, make a game where you are the bloons and you gradually earn more bloons and money. If you make one, make it called btr (Bloons Tower Raid). Thanks.
B0070YDOT8|3.0|Didn't really like it not my game because I am not a card player  of that kind , just wanted to see what it contained
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Bossypants is certainly not the type of book I would typically read; however, on the suggestion of a friend, I bought the book. I couldn't put it down. It had me in tears from laughing so hard. The book is light-hearted and comical- yet thought-provoking at the same time. Whether this book falls into your typical genre or not, I would suggest you read it.

B006LSZECO|3.0|It semed to me that the novel was a bit complicated with too many charaters to keep straight. The ending while surprising I didn,t consider realistic
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|Could not put this book down! While extremely detailed there is never a dull moment. I found myself caught up in the story and each character's life.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Game of thrones is breathtaking from start to finish. George R.R. Martin paints a landscape as vivid as a photograph with characters who come to life before your eyes.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really love the books written by Rick Riordan. This one was no exception. I thought it was very well written. I don't even mind the cliffhanger at the end. Although I really can't wait for the next book to find out what happened!! Arg I want to know! I really loved this book. By far my favorite Heroes of Olympus book!
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|This cd arrived quickly and in great condition.  It was a great price and my daughter is a fan so she requested this as a birthday gift.  Amazon makes it easy for anyone to sit down and order quickly.  We will look to Amazon again to order more cd's in the future.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was not expecting to Love this book as much as I did, but I can proudly say it's one of my favorite novels now. I can't wait to recommend it to all of my friends who are also avid readers. The mystery, passion, romance, and humor are all well portrayed in this amazing piece of work and all I have left to sum up this incredible novel is \\"well done Colleen Hoover, well done.\\"
B004P02OJ6|2.0|A little drawn out but anything with Russel Crowe is usually worth watching.  Good is was free on Amazon Prime.

1401235417|4.0|Scott Snyder seems to be the man of the hour at DC right now but I can't say I've read anything by the author that has really blown me away. My big issue with Court of Owls is that it all feels like I've read this before. We have a secret organization with nefarious plans for Gotham City that has had dealings with the Wayne family going way back. Batman pushes himself past his breaking point trying to track down this new threat leaving the reader questioning his very sanity. The first time I read this story it was called The Black Glove and it was better written. The Black Glove was presented as a new organization whereas The Court of Owls has apparently been around since colonial days. For me it really stretches believability that The Batman would fail to discover, in all these years, an extraordinarily powerful secret organization operating right out of Gotham City. When I wrote a review of The Black Mirror I said that Mirror House felt like a watered down version of The Black Glove so either Snyder was really inspired by Morrison's story arcs or Gotham City is jam packed with secret societies.<br /><br />Another issue I had was how dimwitted Snyder wrote the usually impeccable Alfred. When Bruce formulates a theory that the Court of Owls may have a history of tormenting Wayne's he looks to Alfred for his thoughts but Alfred declines to mention the only possible relevant link he knows considering it \\"irrelevant\\". Bruce prods him further at which point Alfred reveals that Bruce's great great grandfather, Alan Wayne, developed a paranoia regarding a conspiracy of owls who he believed were literally living somewhere in his mansion. Seriously, Alfred didn't think a Wayne relative who was paranoid of a conspiracy of owls might be connected to a conspiracy of owls? Snyder also has a bad habit of having The Batman escape in strange, difficult to follow ways an issue I also had while reading through The Black Mirror. At one point The Batman is fighting a gang of thugs underground who wear iron masks. He produces some object the size of a pill and I guess magnetizes a moving subway car causing their masks (which are firmly attached to their heads) to magnetically adhere. It's rather hard to follow what's happening but if I read it correctly must be one of his most powerful gadgets ever. There's also a weird scene where The Batman tells Nightwing that there is also a tie between The Court of Owls and the Grayson family and then proceeds to backfist Dick in the face for no apparent reason. Nice Batman, real nice.<br /><br />I like the art of Greg Capulla and occasionally I REALLY like it but he doesn't have the consistency of artists like Frank Quitely, Frazier Irving or J.H. Williams. He seem to be much better at drawing bodies than he is at drawing faces with many of them looking overly cartoonish compared to the rest of the art. I also have the feeling he is trying to emulate other artists rather than find his own style. The best part of the book for me was when The Batman finds himself trapped by The Court of Owls. This is where Capulla is at his best since all the characters are wearing masks and Snyder does a good job of disorienting the reader. Unfortunately, I hate to bring this up but the way the scene plays out reminds me a lot of Grant Morrison's R.I.P.<br /><br />I'm old enough to have purchased and read Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns straight from the comic rack. At this point I don't read a lot of comics but when I do I try to get the very best based on professional reviews and buzz I hear. If the buzz is that a storyline is possibly the story of the year I expect something special, something memorable. The Court of Owls is a good, solid story but it doesn't break any new ground. Maybe it's because I've read so much that nothing seems new under the sun but Grant Morrison's run at Batman wasn't the distant past he was literally the previous main writer and for the story to bare such similarities really diminished itsimpact on me. I would recommend it but I could produce at least a dozen Batman stories I enjoyed more.impact on me. I would recommend it but I could produce at least a dozen Batman stories I enjoyed more.
B007N85POS|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this while waiting at DMV, movies and traveling.<br />It is a little more interesting then others in the series
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Performances are amazing, the story is gripping, the humanism extremely refreshing.  I rarely watch movies more than once (too many to see!), but this merits another view.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I usually am not interested in these kinds of puzzles but this one is different and SO much fun so glad I tried it!!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|The sixth season was not interesting at all so I was worried about the seventh season, but Dexter got back his mojo and Deb's conflicts were faciinating to watch.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|I really enjoy a good hidden object game and this one is worth the total $2 price. The hidden objects scenes are a little easy but there is more of a challenge to the mini games. The story is fun and I even jumped a few times when I was not expecting something to happen.<br />The only problem I had while playing was when you get the heart for the scarecrow, put it where it was suppose to go and pulled the cord it froze up. I tried to leave the game and continue but it was still froze. I was a little annoyed but I decided to clear the data and do a force stop under the running applications area of my Kindle Fire hd. This started the game over. I played until the spot where it froze. Got the heart put it in the scarecrow and then left the scene. I went to the previous scene and then back to the scarecrow. I held my breath and pulled the cord. Woohoo it did not freeze up. So far the rest of the game seems to be playing  fine. I hope this info helps anyone else out that might be having the same problem.<br />My friend has the twisted lands game (made by the same company) and had a problem with it freezing also. I hope they will fix this problem because I would love to play it. My friend said it was great until that happened.<br />Thanks for the fun games but please make sure they are bug free so we can enjoy them.
B003E74B24|5.0|Love the quick reads. This actually let me know some of the outlandish behavior on some of the TV shows must be just for TV!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|some reviews said that this book was slower, no developing plot, new characters, no major battles. Well, I agree for the most part- all this book does is develop new characters, and if you love GRRM writing style and this series- you'll love it. I don't need tyrion or jon to make this book great- i now have more characters- better than the onion knight if you ask me.<br /><br />anyways- if you like the series, you'll like this book- don't let the other reviews make you hesitate
B005IQZB14|5.0|The book is about a 26 year old woman who had lost herself to anger and self destruction after the death of her mother, the subsequent scattering of her siblings and step father, and finally, the end of her marriage. Totally under prepared, she took off to hike the Pacific Crest Trail. She challenged her body and resolve in desperation to save herself and wrench out some type of meaning for her life, some sort of peace.  Wonderful diary-like travel journal coupled with memoir, Cheryl grabs your heart and keeps you riveted, especially if you are a searcher yourself. Page turner.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I have fun with Solitaire.  Difference I see with this Solitaire is if you are stuck, you have an option to ask for a Hint - I really only use this when I'm tired and my eyes just don't see straight (lol), but it is a good to have. I also like the 'undo last move' option for when you accidentally made that last move, but wasn't intending to do so
B006TAJ9TI|5.0|I bought these for my husband because he would always steal my croc clogs for going in and out of the house or to the garage.  I was hesitant to spend this type of money when I could have gotten regular clogs for much less but he is so pleased with these that I cannot say the money was not well spent.  Given that these will probably last him years and my clogs are again my own and that he can run out with the dogs in the dead of winter and not worry about slipping have made these one of my best purchases this year!
B003JTHWPA|5.0|If you like the subtle complications of ordinary lives, this book is for you. There are not many cataclysmic events to confront the reader, but life itself in small town America is explored with sensitivity and wonder.

B003M6OW4Y|5.0|it seems all my favorite Joss Whedon shows (firefly, dollhouse) get killed off before their time.  This goes in a dark direction pretty quickly and I love it!  It's more about the ramifications of where the technology could take us vs the eliza dushku show.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This novel is smart and powerful. I stayed up way to late two nights in a row to finish it. Great for teens and adults!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I'm only a few days into a reading plan, but I love this app so far! There are countless reading plan options, which means you can find the one that is perfect for you. I also like that you can choose and switch versions of the bible witha  simple click! I wish I had started using this sooner!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I had purchased construction calculators in the past in order to do fractions quickly. The thing with these calculators is I can never remember how to do fractions on them without some fuss.<br /><br />This app is quick and easy to use. If your into woodworking or metal working you won't have to worry about dead batteries when you need your calculator the most. Plus you will most likely not misplace your phone.<br /><br />For the small price of this app it pays big on ease of use and convenience.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I enjoyed this book, and did get a lot out of it, but I felt that at times it was a little hard to read. Impressive story, and I certainly appreciate the fact that it's a memoir/true story.
B005DB7NHO|5.0|Ideal for directioners, it has tons of pictures and information about them: their lives, carreer... everything! It a great book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I seem to be addicted to this game. Its lots of fun and it makes you concentrate and keep your mind sharp.
0802473156|5.0|My partner and I are reading this and it's so simple yet very profound. I can see how people aren't being fulfilled in their relationships - if you're thinking about giving this book a try, do it. You won't be disappointed.

B007REV4T8|3.0|Skyfall was only an ok movie in my view because all the major scenes make those at MI6 into amateurs instead of a top-shelf professional organization. It would be similar to a basketball game, you start out playing really hard, then you see your teammates are goofing off, then the coach tells you to pass the ball and that player shoots from half court at the wrong basket, so you go into the locker room by yourself and shake your head and have a martini. That's how I felt after watching Skyfall. Not as much Bond (until his decision to go to Skyfall that makes them sitting ducks), but more with the other agents (not finishing off the thief in the very beginning, being infiltrated, not watching the prisoner, etc), and in every scene I kept wondering how they could all be such an amateur organization. I actually like Daniel Craig as James Bond and I think he did fine acting this limiting script in Skyfall. I thought Quantum was alright, and I thought Casino Royale was pretty good (and the ending of CR was amateurish as well but at least CR had some action scenes, but every scene in Skyfall was like they were a bunch of amateur agents. The plot and ending of Skyfall was for a changing of the M guard for yet another future Bond movie. On a side note, I sent a box of dvds in for the Trade-In program, and it appears the Skyfall dvd was lost at the merchant's facility, fortunately Amazon was nice to understand and credit me the amount so thanks Amazon for the kind customer service, so I was going to do the Trade-In more often, but after the stress from the merchant's mistake from now on I will never Trade-In again. Eventhough it did not match the hype, Skyfall is still just an ok movie that a Bond fan will find it worth watching on tv or renting or buying cheaper, if only to prepare for the next Bond movie.
B000002B2T|5.0|The cd was packaged well and no problems with it and no damage. I would recomend this to someone else.

B0010SEMP0|5.0|When I got this book, I was already I love with the series, but this book just took that up a notch. The trials faced agianst Cat and Bones is touching if not a little frustrating at times. I love how much cat has grown up from the first book to the second. There are a lot of surprises in this book, and it's fun reading how the mysteries reveal themselves throughout the book.

B00ADLCC9I|3.0|You would think that when Archos came up with the idea to build a tablet designed to play games, they would have thought to put in a battery that would last more than 2 hours when playing GAMES!  You can search Google for reviews on this device and see that it has gotten absolutely hammered for the poor battery life.  Here's the cut and dry of it.  You will NOT get more than 2 hours of life out of this device if you plan on using it to play games.  Ever so slightly longer if you watch videos.  And this is if you have WIFI off and screen brightness to near minimum.  Which is a shame, because the device is cool.  The screen is clear and of a reasonable quality for the price.  The buttons are decent.  The Dpad is actually 4 separate buttons, so good luck doing any Shoyuken Street Fighter moves.  The mapping tool (used in games that don't support physical buttons, allowing you to map the physical buttons to the on screen buttons) is very nice.  A recent firmware update has solved some lag issues that occurred when using the mapping tool.  Another downer is that the unit only ships with 8GB of internal memory.  Install 2 or 3 Gameloft games and the memory is FULL.  Yes the device has an SD card, but as most people know, you cannot move game data to the external SD card.  The external sd card is used only for media.  Music, movies, and pictures.  All in all, Archos has a decent device here that is absolutely useless unless you are plugged into an AC outlet, or you plan on gaming for less than 2 hour sessions and then plugging in to recharge.  No firmware update is going to fix the battery problem.<br /><br />EDIT:  The MSRP of this device is $169.  Most of the resellers on Amazon are price gouging since this was just released in the USA.  Don't make the mistake of buying from them at those ridiculous prices.  Amazon will have more in stock soon at the MSRP.<br /><br />EDIT2:  I'm upgrading my 2 star review to a 3 star review.  The device is nice, and the controller mapping feature is a breeze to use.  More than 100 games have the mapping pre-programmed so you don't have to map at all for those.  As I said earlier tho, the Achilles heel is the battery life.  But I don't usually sit for 2+ hours at a time and game on this thing.  Those that do should invest in an external battery.g feature is a breeze to use.  More than 100 games have the mapping pre-programmed so you don't have to map at all for those.

B0052RDHTM|4.0|Ken Follett knows how to research his books! This is a fascinating story about the background leading up to and including WW 1. But what makes it readable is his characters. They are very real and I wanted to know what happened to all of them. I like how he wove their stories together. I was also anxious to read Book 2.
0553801473|4.0|Have read all previous books in the series and looking forward to seeing how it all turns out.  Final book is a little &#34;draggy&#34; in parts but still a well told tale.  I will be sorry to end the story.
B00BEFL5Q8|2.0|Can somebody get Brett Anderson a writing coach? His lyrics have been stagnant for years. His last good showing was Coming Up. This is just more of the same that he's been doing solo and with his side project The Tears. Shoddy shoddy lyrics. If the lyrics were alright then it'd be tolerable but you get half way through the album and you have to turn it off it gets so tiresome. This is my favorite band and from this I wish they never would have made Head Music, A New Mourning and this. They had two absolutely brilliant classic albums, their debut and Dog Man Star, and a really great album Coming Up plus all the b sides from those albums were brilliant as well.<br /><br />But going back to the lyrics. They are the worst!!!!! This guy can't write worth crap anymore. His solo albums are abysmal. Can you say his lyrics are annoying? Yes they are. What was one of the lyrics, something about a raven's shadow. It's so melodramatic and meaningless. Suede officially ended in 1996 I'm sorry to say. The band need to pack it in unless they have an intervention with Brett. And to a more general point, rock is a young man's game. The oldsters need to retire before 40 with their rock music.
B00B52F278|5.0|We're 3 episodes away from the finale and this is by far and away the most incredible season yet. I'm so sad this is ending. I'm loving it.
B00005BJPO|3.0|I had to buy this because i love anime and this is considered one of the best ever. I gotta say i don't see what all the hype is about. I found the story a little hard to follow but i was falling asleep the whole time so that could be why. The animation is excellent however and still holds up today.  I guess i just didn't see what everyone else did.  I loved this when i was like 12 but it just didnt do it for me now that i'm 28.<br />It arrived when expected and in the described condition.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|It is very easy to use, my email comes in without a problem and it doesn't freeze like other email apps that I have had in the past!
0792839749|5.0|I got this for a college girl from Mexico.  She had never seen it and she absolutely loved it. Thanks.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Period perfect and superior acting and wonderful<br />storyline!  I could watch it just for the interiors and the scenery alone.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|the digital alarm wakes me up and i sleep like the dead so this is fabulous. the other alarms may wake lighter sleepers.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great Game, if you ask me. Kids like playing this too. Keeps them busy for a little bit. Try it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was entertaining and held my interest, but I was disappoint by the way it ended.  It seemed to end abruptly.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great Game, if you ask me or the kids. Kids love this game. Keeps them busy for a little bit.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|This book is very good<br />and really surprise me I love it<br />It is very helpful<br />I recommend this book
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great Game, if you ask me or the youngsters. Kids love this game. Keeps them occupied for a little bit.
B00785P2QC|4.0|So far so good. It's kind of fast paced. Sometimes the trucks quit running and I haven't figured a couple of them out yet. Pretty addicting so far.
B00B31DT5I|5.0|Enjoy the recap of music from my college days.  Michael and friends have made the music come alie and singing along is a highlight everytime I listen.  Knowing the words and remembering the good times is just an added benefit!
B00A7ZXDLQ|3.0|Overall the music was sub par, now don't get me wrong their are some good songs but the last thing you want to hear are riri and Chris brown...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the graphics are very very clear and realistic!!! not an easy kid game but instead a challenging fun adult game too!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Has all the sports, music and talk stations I love. Has searchable podcasts of daily/weekly shows. Scheduled/live record to SD is awesome.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My husband swears I am addicted to this game. But it is worth while to play while in bed and listening to him snore. Great to keep you entertained during a boring meeting.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Nice little app, does what I need, the free version not a spamvertiser so I went paid and like it.Had the free since I got the phone and only the paid version for less than a month,will add more later
B0091REZMW|5.0|Best hidden object game I've ever played. Game moves along at a nice pace without having to spend money &amp; still be enjoyable :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best show, never thought I would like a zombie show so much! It's thrilling from beginning to end- a must see.
1591396190|5.0|Quite simply this is one of the best business books of any kind I have ever had the pleasure to read. I have begun to develop some of the methods the writers suggest and have already begun to gain traction in my marketplace.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What a strange and wonderful thought to be able to change the past. But the affect it has on the future is horrible.
B00A1XIXM8|5.0|Great music.... music is in true Bad Religion form....could be one of their best CDs to date.  You won't regret buying it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazingly gripping episode (14). I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. This is the best show in television history. 5 Stars all the way!!!! Amazing, stellar acting!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Choice of settings and cast were excellent. Scrips was well written and including help in story line and their problems added to plot.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|I loved this movie. It is full of adventure and the characters are great. The dwarfs were awesome and funny.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This book one again made the reader think about a deep issue.  I didn't find the reason for the suicide to be deep enough nor serious enough.  I also found the brother/lover relationship a little too out there.  The issue of the book however was poignant and worth the extra thinking this book evoked.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I literally couldn't stop laughing half of the time and the other half of the time I was smiling. Must read! Incredible book. I wish it never ended :(
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was a very easy read - but also very predictable.  But sometimes you just want a book that you know the good guy is going to win!
B0007P0LPC|5.0|I love this ballet.  I wanted my students to experience this performance.  I could not believe that even my 1st and 2nd grade students were so involved in watching this dvd.  They were so quiet and attentive.  I would recommend this to anyone
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I was very young when this was happening in the news. Great story. Lots of funny parts amidst all the stressful scenes.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I think it was the best James Bond movies I have seen.<br />They just keep getting better & I also love, love love, Adele singing the theme song!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Fun movie.  I like to see the aging 007 beat the odds.  I will miss Judi Dench but she was great in The Great Exotic Marigold Hotel.
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|I am use to Bacon having a robust happy expression of being.<br />He seems to be struggling to be serious, pained and concerned.<br />Something is missing with his portrayal and believability, that he<br />actually feels his character to his heart and soul. Anger doesn't always<br />substitute for true fear, terror, anxiety, crazy-making conflicts and frustration.<br />This is my first episode, so I felt that perhaps he needs more time and experience<br />with the character to make it, Bacon's own.  Some one else commented that the script<br />needs to allow the mischievous and bright eye magic of Bacon to come out periodically.<br />This complete darkness  and suppression of self is not Bacon's forte'.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I kept getting this dumb pop up ad, so i finally downloaded it to make it stop. This seems like the dumbest game ever.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|great characters...great stories....great everything.  Here is you LA LAW for the 2000's, but better. I love this show..and I'm picky about shows.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|We wanted to try the video service and thought we would start with this movie. My husband is a huge fan and I hadn't seen it yet. I still haven't!  The movie stopped and started constantly and about every 20 minutes or so would stop all together. We switched over to another service and watched a movie there.  We didn't have the same problem with other service, so it was definitely on Amazons' end. Not very impressed.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|first of all...remember rocky...when you first saw it...how you felt after...well this is kinda like that...but better graphics editing..acting ect...  I'm not beating on Rocky..that was awesome.  The fights are real looking and intense. The two main character are brothers and super hot.  I love Tom Hardy..he played bane in the last batman movie. This movie is about two brothers and the bulls*** they go thur..and the things un said between them. The ending has to be one of the best ending ever!
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|I love this show but I kinda wish it was a movie. I think this story line could get boring really quick.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|all and I mean all the characters....are funny and fit perfect!!!!  If you have never seen it...you should.  I highly recommend it. You will laugh you butt off.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My three year old is in love with &#34;Hotel Feenafeena&#34; as he puts it, the shipping was surprisingly fast, wrapped in extra layers of bubble wrap. Movie is adorable, its hard to find things for kids that you as the parent wont mind watching a million times. Hotel Transylvania is both funny and cute. Has a good story line for both parents and kids. Would recommend it to everyone. Adam Sandler has done it again.
B00AVIPXKI|5.0|I rarley watch movies more then once....this is one of the few. This whole series is great!  Micheal is hot...the hybrid. Kate beckinsale is awesome and kicks ass.  I highly recommend this movie...men and women.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|It wont load on my phone. Also it wont remove off of downloading. ne help wud b nice and helpful.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|So pleased that I can now download books from the Kindle store on my tablet just as easily as I can do on my Kindle.  I find buying and downloading books from Amazon so much easier than other book sites.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|One the edge, suspenseful and provocing.  This is a great series and well worth the time.  A must see.  A+
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was late coming on board to watch Downton Abbey but when I started with Season 1, I watched it and Season 2 in under two weeks.  When I started watching Season 3 on television it was already on episode 5.  I then purchased the first 4 episodes and I'm glad I did.  They were worth it!
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Whimsical, fun and good reprisal of tin tin, as a fan of the comics back when i was a kid i was pleased with the humor and the portrayal of the characters.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The world of Downton Abbey goes on, disturbed and turned topsy turvy by WWI, but life goes on.  I'll not include any spoilers here, but every episode is riveting.  The acting is superb, the writing brilliant, the scenery and photography fabulous.  Don't miss it, then go on to Season 3.  Downton Abbey is a world in which one can become engrossed.  At the end of each season, I find myself slightly disoriented, wondering, foggily, when I'll be allowed to return home again, upstairs or down.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Awesome logical look at a completely illogical and impossible war. Slow Zombies rule. Haven't seen the movie yet but I don't think it can live up to the book.
B005TKD8ZK|5.0|Everyone who ran 5k once in a life must read it! Who doesn't run but loves Murakami Haruki's books, also must read it, because this is a very interesting occasion to know the writer personally. His thoughts are clear, and brilliant!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Probably the best I have ever enjoyed. Absolutely wonderful story, great actors, and beautiful settings. Thank you to everyone who had a part in this series and to my children who bought the DVDs for me. Mossy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game! It is so much fun and so addicting that I can't stop playing it! It is really awesome! :)
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Unbelievably great, I never enjoyed anything so much as this. It is truly a Masterpiece, great actors, great characters and beautiful settings, Mossy
B008I3RARW|5.0|GREATFUN !!! I liked using the kindle screen to controle the car. Lots of FUN!!!<br />I do recommend the ride...
B000MZHW40|4.0|I liked this movie, I had just come from Kenya when I saw it on Amazon and bought it along with other films about Africa so it was thrill to see it. I had a problem with the filthy language, I cringe when I hear it. It didn't add anything to the story and was offensive to those of us who don't choose to have those words in our lives. Leave it out and it would have been 5 stars. Mossy
0262731541|2.0|A capa do livro engana. Minha expectativa era de ser um livro leve que falasse um pouco sobre v&aacute;rias questões relacionadas &agrave; bicicleta como sua hist&oacute;ria, modelos, bike fit, geometria, etc.. O livro &eacute; um estudo acadêmico com questões relacionadas ao ciclismo, como controle t&eacute;rmico do ciclista, tempo de frenagem, tudo ilustrado com gr&aacute;ficos e tabelas. Enfim, o livro &eacute; extremamente t&eacute;cnico e de utilidade question&aacute;vel para um ciclista amador.
B00AVPYT8I|1.0|I am using a kindle fire and have the reader,this app sends you to get the kindle reader app every time you use it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I think I read this book in two sittings.  It was such a great story.  Loved the characters.  Gave me a different view of dying with dignity.  I passed it on to my 88 year old mother and she read it into the wee hours of the morning to finish.  She was so sad when it was over because she said she missed the characters.  Warning...keep a tissue or three close by while reading.
B0013TTLDE|3.0|Morton does a lovely job evoking the period before WW I. Her research is meticulous and it shows. The story, OTOH, is obvious, overwrought and longer than it needs to be. I could really have done without the &#34;had I but known....&#34; foreshadowing. It's her first book, and I might pick up her second, because she writes very well and may have learned something about plotting.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|great trilogy, loved all three books. liked this one best of all. looking forward to the fifty shades movie. love it
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The story keeps you captivated. Wonderful acting and I love the house. You are never bored watching this story, can't wait to see the next season.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|I'm really loving this album. It's incredible that with two decades of rock under their belts, Clutch is still pumping out fantastic and fresh music. If you've been a fan of Clutch in the past you'll definitely enjoy this album. It's an awesome blend of hard rock and metal with a touch of blues. A bit less funk and blues influences than some of their previous albums.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote daily. I have it on my pc, kindle and my cell phone. I love the ability to not have to print out and waste paper, instead I just refer to Evernote.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book. It's a great read. It was Very hard to put down! Great story with a good ending makes it a great book.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I had read good reviews of this book.  But in spite of an interesting and very readable beginning, the last third of the story was contrived, unbelievable,not all that well written,and very disappointing. I was so annoyed when I finished it that I deleted it from my Kindle. (I'm sort of sorry now that I did that, but at the time I didn't want the title to even appear on my home site.)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The best thing that happened to a series. Finally a good wholesome program with all the necessary evils required to make good drama with ought the filth. Hooked
B002KREVCO|4.0|CD1 is where the jewels are; contains Bon Scott rareties.<br />CD2 is a bit of fluff with a bunch of live songs.<br />DVD has a bit of extras, that I believe are not included on the Family Jewels DVD #3.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|Gotta love this one with all the muscle.  Wish some of the 'cameo' shots were longer roles but it was still a good action flick.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is a love story with some dark twists and turns.  Until the end, you didn't know the truth.  Very good book.  Couldn't put it down.  Sympathetic characters.
B004HO6HWK|4.0|Great action and character development.  Had a twist I was sorry to see but was necessary for the plot.  One of my favorites with Jason Statham.
B0081X8AE6|5.0|This Album is a must for anyone who enjoys music!!  Michael Kiwanuka is destined to become a big star! Listen to the Music!
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I wasn't too pleased with this movie. I like the two actors, but wasn't interested in the story line. Thank you
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Easy to use, nice layout and I love the task list and the color-coding for daily appointments. The best calendar I've yet found.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I love this game u can get recipes fir crafting and u have like TONS IF MOBS!!!! I know there is more than in minecraft and minecraft pe I love this game! So Mutch!!!!!! So it's like thanks fir outing it on the cloud fir the kindle I hated how in the lite I couldn't go into my saved worlds.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|my son couldn't sleep so I downloaded this app it was a miracle he went to sleep in seconds thx to whoever created this app
B0041KBWM0|5.0|It's the story I already know SO well, and have seen other versions, but the acting was fresh and delightful.  I recommend this for an enjoyable watch.
0767802470|4.0|You can sense the frustration and fear of the people on the submarine.  Very nice acting and a very good story.
B00AZNEW5G|2.0|Part of the movie was so dark you couldn't tell what was going on and there was too much vulgar language.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The story continues and is still great.  The ups and downs are interesting and fun.  Looking forward to Season 4.
B00AFEXRME|2.0|I was disappointed with this movie. I think Denzel is a great actor but the movie wasn't what I expected.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I liked everything about this book - so thoughtfully written - powerful, totally fascinating. The main character was such a strong woman - it is inspiring. It makes one think about the flowers around us or the flowers we buy. Such an intelligent strategy for this young woman.
0062112430|5.0|When I first read the premise of the book I wasn't sure I liked the basis of love being considered a disease. After reading the preview of the first chapter I decided to give it a shot and bought the book. I do not regret it at all. The story is touching and seeing a version of the world where love is considered the worst disease makes you really appreciate the love that you have, even when it doesn't go as planned.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Gets bogged down in the middle, to many twists to keep up with. Overall, not a bad read. Would recommend it.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game really was a thrill for the hour or two I played it.  The &quot;farm&quot; was much stronger than the road.  The graphics and sound are cool and help you feel immersed in another world.  And the requirement to recover the notes while evading Slenderman does create a sense of excitement and adventure.  What's needed is a little more depth and mystery.  I can imagine the game being enhanced to something like Myst but with slenderman after you in real time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it because the are hoverboards and I like Jake plus if you update it it will be an another place right now its rome
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Absolutely could not stop reading, read it in one day. I am dying to see how it plays out on the big screen
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game. All modes are fun.  Once I start playing I don't  stop as I want to beat my time. Well worth the purchase especially if you like matching games.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins has an incredible gift as she creates a world that is controlled by hunger. If you play the game correctly, you might even survive in order to live the life of an extremely damaged human being. However, hope still lives in a very small corner of your soul.
B000FC2ROU|4.0|This strangest book I've  ever enjoyed.  I don't look at the world in the same way as I did before reading Kafka.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best of the trilogy. Exciting, compelling and extremly thought provoking. This book made me eager to read the entire set.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Didn't work on my older phone, and Amazon provided no warning this might happen. So this review is more a review of the app store selling the game than of the game itself.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book does not disappoint. The ending fits the story and is far more believable than the alternative. I enjoyed all three books and was sorry to reach the end.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was such a great book. I read it in two days I wanted to see what would happen to the main characters.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Love the book.  Ken Follett never disappoints.  Keeps your attention to the very end.  Would highly recommend this book to read.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|I desperately needed a real audio interface, I was tired of my toy Behringer 1 i/o RCA usb thing.  After reading reviews online, this seemed like exactly what I needed.  It's small, lightweight, and fits nicely on my desk.  It's got some solid pre's, and has enough for me to work with.  I didn't need the extra i/o enough to break the bank, so 2i2 is all I wanted.  I'm really pleased with this, the quality is great and the ease of use is just as great.  It handles line and mic inputs just as well, and the general rule of thumb sticks here that ~70% (about 2-3 o'clock on these knobs) is a good base level for the pre's.  Phantom power works fine, and the direct monitoring switch is really useful.  I don't like dealing with latency in Ableton, so to be able to just monitor directly when I'm playing instead of waiting for it to go through all that processing is great.  And the headphone volume and monitor volume are right next to each other...all in all I'd say the design of this is very user friendly.<br /><br />Some people reported driver issues with this, and I can't say I've really had any problems.  I'm using Windows, and I have to suggest using the ASIO drivers whenever possible.  I had some issues with iTunes where the audio would just stop and the level (in the Windows sound menu) was frozen at whatever had been playing.  All I had to do was disable and re-enable in the device, but that got kind of annoying.  I e-mailed Focusrite about it, and they were pretty prompt with getting back to me, but the problem kind of faded away so I never really figured out what that was.  I started using Fubar2000 because it supports ASIO, and I haven't had ANY issues with any program that uses an ASIO driver.  I have since started using iTunes again as well (still much easier to manage the library in there), and the problem has only manifested itself once or twice since then, so who knows.
B004DZXC30|4.0|The a team is an excellent action thriller. The story is an old one but i really like the new take on it.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I really liked this app and checked it all the time.I updated it 3/20/13 and now it is useless to me because all the info is so small I can't t read it. The old format showed the extended forecast in an easy to see list you could tap on for more details. This update does not make the app better.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Threat Vector has a plot that thinks ahead, is realistic in a general sense, and plays on political issues of cyber threats that has recently been at the forefront in the news! brilliant.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Sometimes this app works, but you have to have a fast internet connection.  Takes a long time to render and buffer, but if you have a Kindle Fire like me, then this app will allow you to watch YouTube videos in nice HighDef.  Still, long time to load and only works with good internet...
B00A72989U|5.0|Alicia Keys is so good. This album is great. It has upbeat songs as well as her soulful melodies. Its a great mix. My 3yr old son & I  love Girl on Fire & New Day. Its so cute when he sings with me. They have so much meaning to them like Woman's Worth & Superwoman. I love love love this CD & Alicia Keys. Can't wait to c her in concert!
1878424319|5.0|Out entire office management team has been given this book.Great wisdom, easy read and provides new insight to ones self.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Downloaded this to be able to watch videos, and I still haven't watched one yet. This app is a complete waste of space on my Kindle fire. Deleting immediately.
1250010403|5.0|it is great. Better if you read it in order with the other books. Cant wait for the next one!!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|haven't really used it yet as I cant figure out how and when to put it to use, but then, I'm no good when it comes to electronics
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is better then the other temple run games. It is fun. And it changes the further you go. It is the first game I bought on the kindle fire. It is worth getting for 0.99
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I lay this more than anything I have, I am not fast enough to get below 5 minutes, but love the challenge
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Faithful rendition of a changing egalitarian world starting to clash with a time of privilege. The forces that make the change are hard to read for those living at that time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing piece of teen fiction. Up there with Harry Potter and Orson Scott Card. Couldn't put it down even at work.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the second time I've read this series of books and I could read them all over again and will.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is my favorite app at this time. I find many useful projects with this app. I have done many projects from this site
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|won't download correctly on my Kindle fire. I have tried multible times...I have talked to others and they have the same trouble
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another great techno, war, spy thriller from the master!  International intrigue and faced paced action, a real page turner.  Must read for Clancy fans and a great book for first time Clancy readers to get started on Clancy novels.
B003FBMS4W|4.0|Yes, it's a good idea to be reading Amazon movie reviews from random schmucks for more insight on The Searchers.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Good easy read not much excitement in this one though but glad I read it.  looking forward to his next novel.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|If you liked the Pac Man cartoon from the mid-80's Saturday morning TV, then . . .you're too old for &#34;Wreck It, Ralph&#34; but you have crappy taste, so maybe you'll like it.
B000002LHX|5.0|a gift for my grandson and he loved it veryvery much,i have nothing more to say about this batman movie
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Looks and acts like a standard teen comedy with a GOOD cast and nice musical numbers until ***SA*** someone starts doing snow angels in a pile of puke ***SA**.
B0030F5W5K|5.0|This is one that you cant stop watching.  Now I double check the shadows! AND with Prime it's even more enjoyable.
B00AEFVRB2|4.0|My life would have turned out completely different if only I'd seen this movie before I put out a hit on my mother.
B002RI98BA|5.0|I really enjoyed it, and felt I accomplished something by finishing it. It is really informative not just about Lincoln and his team, but the time they were living in.
B00BLGZDYA|4.0|If you're looking for original imagery that will surprise, and something that will make you think, but possibly not come to any conclusions, you might like it.

B0099114WO|5.0|This is a gift for my youngest daughter. But it is a really good movie with Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones. The plot never stops and the humer is under rated. I found it very funny and kept my interest throughout the entire movie.
B0059XTV7Q|5.0|This movie should actually go down in history as a classic, that was panned by critics since it was done by superstar and a woman. In 100 years classes will be discussing why Madonna was ignored on this great film, since of celebrity status that no matter what great art you produce, the public will try to to cast you and debase your work on lies and deceit. If a man had done this movie it would of been a sensation.
B00ATP24NW|5.0|Gift for youngest daughter that came with a MP3 file that you download once you purchased it. She was thrilled. I can't honestly say anything about the music ans the CD was mailed to her as a gift, but she is 29 and it is her taste of music.

B007REV4T8|5.0|This James Bond seems to meet the approval of both men and women.  He is a combination of all our past 007's.  a very exciting film that has lots of action and captivates the city of London.  Thumbs up for this one!!
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I should begin by saying that I was a huge fan of the original LOTR trilogy. I was already a fan of the books and the movies exceeded my expectations. I was also very excited when I heard that Peter Jackson was not only making The Hobbit, but that it was going to be a trilogy. I know some people complain about the length of these movies, but I get lost in these films like no others, so I could watch for hours, and I was looking forward to nine more hours of hobbit tales and adventure.<br /><br />The truth is, it would have been almost impossible for Peter Jackson to make a hobbit movie that I did not like. I have already bought into the whole world, and any trip to Middle Earth is going to be a trip that I enjoy. I just finished watching The Hobbit for the first time and I certainly enjoyed it. There are a lot things, I think, to enjoy in this movie. There are a whole host of new characters (all the dwarves), as well as a lot of returning characters. There is more background on the history of Middle Earth. There are, of course, lots of stunning visuals. I felt like all the actors did their jobs well. I was particularly pleased with Martin Freeman, who I very much enjoyed in the BBC Sherlock Holmes specials, as a young Bilbo Baggins. I think most of the die hard fans of the original trilogy will find a lot to enjoy here.<br /><br />That having been said, there did seem to me to be something missing from this film. It is something mysterious. Perhaps it is simply the lack of surprise. When I went to see The Fellowship of the Ring in theaters I had no idea what to expect, and I was blown away, and I felt like each successive movie managed to blow me away in a new way. Now, we pretty much know what to expect, and I feel like this movie, perhaps for that reason, did not have the same impact on me as the originals. I also felt like it was more difficult to differentiate between the dwarves. One of the things that made the original trilogy great was that each main character had a unique personality and it was great watching them interact. A few dwarves manage to stand out, but so far, they are sort of one giant collective character. That is not necessarily Peter Jackson's fault. He is just following the book, and in The Hobbit the companions are all dwarves, rather than one dwarf, one elf, two humans, one wizard, and four hobbits, but I think it might be one reason I was not as enthralled with this movie.<br /><br />Now, that having been said, Peter Jackson did set up some really interesting stuff for the next two movies. I was particularly pleased with the introduction of The Necromancer who promises to be an interesting foe. And, of course, Smaug will play more of a role in the other movies. I have a secret hope that Peter Jackson is going to find a way to fit Tom Bombadil into the trilogy, since he was left out of the original trilogy, but that is probably an unrealistic hope. There was, obviously, a lot of setting up to do in this movie, and that is probably another reason I was not as enthralled with this movie as I was with the original trilogy. Still, the movie held my interest, it felt great to be back in Middle Earth, and I am now eagerly awaiting the next installment...r had a unique personality and it was great watching them interact.

B00AFEXRME|5.0|I love Danzel Washington for this reason.  He portrayed a real life situation that was so believable.  I don't always care for this negative subject matter but you have to see it just because Washington is so good!

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I remember when this took place and think Ben Affleck has done a wonderful job bringing it to the screen.  I really felt he could have used a better actor for his part.  Did not think that was his best work.  Too unemotional!!

B005PK56TA|5.0|One of the top 5 shows on television.  It's superior to 99% of the horror movies released in the last 15 years.  Can't wait for season 3.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A great continuation to the story.  You won,t be able to wait to watch season three.  Thank you Britan for the show.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I am very pleased with all aspects.  Great style of writing.  Brings back so many memories of my childhood.  Love the pictures.  They were a nice surprise.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|For some reason I didn't expect to enjoy this film. However, my husband wanted to see it so there I was renting it from Amazon. To my surprise I was completely drawn into the story and often at the end of the film on the edge of my seat. Bravo!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was never into horror films, especially not the zombie type but after hearing so many good things about this show I decided to give it a shot, so I watched the first couple of episodes of season 1 on Netflix and was hooked. Now I rented the season 3 on Amazon on-demand and is just as fun to watch. I would say at the end of each episode, you just got to see what comes next and you start the next and keep going. Watching them back to back on demand was a fun thrill ride. I recommend it to everyone except maybe not kids (there is a LOT of Zombie killing constantly) but I guess cause they are already dead it doesn't seem as bad after watching the show.
B0086700CM|4.0|It is very fun but temple run 2 is much better!!!!!!!!!!I like it because it is very easy yet fun!!!!!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Everyone knows how its supposed to end and the suspense scenes at the end seemed contrived. The on location scenes were very believable, you get a feel for the times, the direction was okay. Again, I didn't feel the suspense or was particularly moved by the story. Its an okay movie, definitely a rental.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Okay let me start by stating that I am a huge fan of Peter Jackson's work and of J.R.R Tolkein. Now that being said I have looked forward to this movie coming out for a long time and despite seeing the movie in the theater having it at home just made my joy complete. This movie was brilliantly casted, special props to whomever it was that chose Richard omg when he came to Bilbo's door that look, I swear I came!!!! Okay probably TMI but really it is an amazing movie!!!
B002V092M4|5.0|Anybody who hasn't read this book, should do it as soon as possible. It is a fundamental piece in contemporary literature. Masterful, complex, thoroughly enjoyable.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|My son told me I had to read this book....but it was not my typical murder mystery so I wasn't excited about it. But I told him I would read it so I did...and once I started I didn't want to put it down!  Loved it... And will read more !
1452113432|5.0|I am glad that the book has metric conversions.  I previously had to listen well and hope that I heard measurements correctly from the TV show and then convert from metric.  Take the time to read the introductions to each chapter.  The book is lovely and the photography is outstanding.

0762439009|5.0|I bought this for my nephew and it's awesome.  From the rug that ties the room together to the severed toe, this kit has it all.  Any Lebowski fanatic would love to receive this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This sure is an interesting, intense, book with twist and turns to keep the reader glued and interested. A slight hesitation at the beginning had me nearly give up however I did persist, as with all the positive reviews it had to get better. It became so much more than I expected it was an amazingly addictive teenage story of angst, love and heartache<br /><br />Sky meets Dean Holder, who on first impressions is an extremely intense, careless and wild boy/man. Sky fears this intensity yet is attracted to it at the same time. Holder is the first guy that has her teenage hormones set loose where previously she would date just to kiss the guy in order to numb herself and not have to think. As the storyline continues we see that Holder is truly a sweet considerate extraordinary young man and extremely loving to Sky, disguised with his tough exterior but the mush mellow interior that is always evident around Sky<br /><br />They have what is referred to as a \\"best first kiss in history of kissing without even kissing\\" and wow how true that is. Having read more erotic based novels all I can say is for such an innocent act it was mighty hot to the credit of Ms. Hoover's amazing writing talent.<br /><br />Once Sky begins to remember what she has blocked from remembering since she was adopted, the story does become a little dark and intense for young teenage audiences, which I think had it not been for the last section of the book would have been a perfectly innocent love story for a teen to read.<br /><br />I will not be giving away any of the true grit of the story of when Sky remembers her time before her adoption as I would recommend all mature minded audiences to purchase this book and enjoy the highs, the lows, and all in-between without me ruining it for you...ENJOY!!!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is like fun and interactive paint drying, and I earnestly mean the as a compliment. The large packed maps are a pleasant way to zone out.<br />The more dynamic game types with orbits or AI opponents are a bit more fast paced and like a traditional mobile quick play game, but still feels unique.<br />The ambient style soundtrack is also a pleasant compliment to the more relaxed pace gaming. Check it out.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This was a great deal. Good movie. Thirteen more words are required to complete my submission to this damn website.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|I did not have any idea on how to build a book for Kindle, so looking around the kindle store I found this Kindle book about how to Build Your Book for Kindle. I ended very pleased with this easy-to-read-and-understand guide, so I recommend anyone who wants to have the neccesary knowledge on how to format in the right way and all those many other important details about a Kindle book.<br /><br />So definetly, I give to this 5 stars
0517543052|5.0|This is the book that got Ram Dass recognized for his spiritual guidance. He led quite an interesting life, which he talks about in depth.<br />Don't assume it's preachy, or aimed at a target faith, I believe anyone that wants good in their life will get something from the book. There is at least one documentary and podcasts devoted to Ram, he's wise, honest and kind.<br />I'd like to say more about his life, but I don't want to ruin the book. If you're on the fence about getting a copy, just buy it, it's cheap, and it just might change your life... We can't put a price on happiness.

B006M9NJFG|5.0|I'm lucky enough to spend half the year backpacking & hunting in the mountains. It gives me a great opportunity to really test my gear out for honest, factual reviews. This canteen & cup set is the best on the market in my opinion. Find a way to man up and get past the Bear Grylls logo (still don't understand why people let that sway their judgement) and buy this set. It holds up to fantastic abuse. Look at that...I just bought another one for myself.
B00935KWWO|5.0|Love how smooth the interface is. So easy to navigate on my Kindle Fire. Definitely a snazzy and beautiful app. :)
B00BR476TG|5.0|Long enough to peak one's interest and convinced me to order the film.  Ang Lee is such<br />  an evocative director no matter what or where the story takes place.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so amazing. It is a super addicting game so I can't put it down. My whole family loves the game.
0345803485|5.0|I would recommend this product to adults. I love the book, however, I don't feel it is appropriate for a minor to read.
B001609SQA|5.0|The actors are amazing, the acting is amazing, the effects for there time are amazing! This is the best of all of the Alien movies.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|I love this show.  The concept of the brainy, nerdy, chemistry teacher becoming a meth cook is just too delicious for words.  There is a razor sharp sense of humor behind the script.  The contrasts kill me.
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|Considering its the first book in the series, it was odd to just be thrown into a pool w a ton of different kinds of species. Good suspense on finding out what the heroine is.
B002R88G4U|4.0|It is a very charming book. We have read it in a Reading Circle in Oslo, Norway and we all found it very interesting as well as entertaining<br />Little did we know about the occupation of Guernsey.<br />All the persons in the book are very charming. although somehow unrealistic, but it really does not matter.<br />A book I will recommend to all Reading Circles and friends, as I have done.
B00005JKGO|5.0|&#34;La Dolce Vita&#34; remains a meandering vision of the world intent on display, but incapable of revealing . It's tedious, gorgeous,artificial and true. As mid century modern madness comes back in fashion, this should be the guide for those who understand the values of style over substance. Marcello Mastroianni, Anouk Aimee and Anita Ekberg have waited impatiently for fifty years to instruct a new generation in looking astonishingly cool in exhausting decadence. The film coalesces Fellini's direction, a bewildering apt cast, a cinema verite camera style and proto-maximalist script into one of the singularly beautiful visions of the myth of celebrity and modernity. Now after half a century, it's like excavating Roman ruins and finding Vanity Fair.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Sent to my husband while he was stationed in Afghanistan. He liked them so much that he actually brought them back home with him after his deployment ended.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|TED is one of the few products that far exceeds expectations. Even lectures I didn't think I'd been interested in I found thought provoking. I place this next to MIT Open courseware as genuine innovations in the war with ignorance.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Loved it would recommend it to everyone have read it three times and will read it again and again thanks
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great portrayal of a time gone by. Shows how classes in early 20th century England<br />were so very apart financially, yet so much alike personally. Watching this series<br />is habit forming in a great way. Can't wait to see Season 3
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|What an absolutely fantastic movie!  On top of that; it's like an all-star cast of young Hollywood, as well as slightly older Hollywood, like Paul Rudd.  Plus; even Tom Savini is in it...you do know who Tom Savini is, right?
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My daughter loves this movie- very funny and the message was sweet- a dad not wanting to let his daughter grow up.
B00AJLHUA8|2.0|I was at a showing of the original HALLOWEEN when someone recommended this.  Unfortunately; I can't do the same here.<br /><br />If you're easily spooked, you might like it, but overall, I thought this was a boring retread of other recent horror movies and ghost stories.  Actually; the recent DARK SKIES is much better than this.<br /><br />On the plus side; the quality of the blu ray for SINISTER is very good.
B00BP4SJKI|5.0|My daughter loved this movie as much as I did when I was her age!  One of the Disney classics for sure.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game,  very fun to play. Play it just about every night.Love to see other people playing and where they are<br />From.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Loved it. I plan to catch more episodes. Can't get enough of Lucy Liu. The writing is very good. The story line makes you think.
B00979CS50|5.0|This is not an album for Harvest fans. When Neil and the Horse romp, you love it, or not.  My 10 year-old daughter was listening to \\"Drifting Back\\" and said \\"its the same thing over and over again; it's boring.\\" For me, being wrapped in ol' black's fuzzy embrace is like stepping outside on a humid, starry summer evening - no matter how familiar, it never gets old. That said,this is Neil and the Horse at their best in years. Lyrically, the songs are as straightforward as a friend's phone call. Note how frequently \\"feel\\" and its cognates occur; coincidence? Sonically (is there a better word?) this album is vintage Neil Young and Crazy Horse - a few notes, played often and under varying degrees of duress; effects that make you wonder how long after the fact flashbacks can occur; and guitar, guitar, guitar,....
B0094K1PW4|3.0|It seems made more for adolesents than adults. The film is well made, but the story line is a little sophomoric.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This sequal was a little slow getting started, but turned out to be nearly as enjoyable<br />as the original, The Hungert Games. I look foward to reading the 3rd book,<br />Mockingjay.
B00633W614|5.0|The first book left you no choice but to read the second!  I liked the follow up of the characters and will read the third as soon as it comes out.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I bought several of these and have mounted them in each bedroom of my house, the kitchen, the entryway, the garage, and the patio.  Each one has a maglite flashlight mounted in it.  Strong, sturdy, keeps the flashlight perfectly mounted and ready to use.  If you mount these in a proper orientation (will depend on your needs/desires/home configuration) you can simple turn the flashlight on and leave it in the brackets and it will provide light for the whole room during a power outage at night.  Great bargain and great product!
B005OP7162|4.0|I have only watched the pilot but am looking forward to the rest of the season.  I've heard good reports.
0547848412|5.0|I bought it for my grandson--he loves it!! He saw the movie and fell in love with it.  So I bought the book for his library.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This watch is an excellent value, it has 21 jewels with a self winding movement. The size is ideal for me as I do not like large clunky watches.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|The interaction between the two main characters who are from very different life circumstances brought to the forefront the beauty of human interaction when we let down our barriers and stereotypes and give ourselves a chance to really know one another and to let ourselves be known.  After the first 15 minutes you won't even notice you are reading subtitles (if you are not a French speaker) you will be so captured by the story.
B002QNEJT2|5.0|I watched a bunch of the shows on netflix a few years back, and enjoyed it.  Started to watch it from start to finish, and it really is an enjoyable show to watch.<br /><br />The world's most lovable Serial Killer :)
B00AYPXG5W|4.0|This movie really leaves you wondering. Did they make it up?  Was it a hoax.<br />Or could it be real.<br />This movie also looks at friends and human interaction.<br />It is worth watching. Do not watch alone.
B004EF8AJA|4.0|It doesn't have the acting or depth of plot and characters as does other series, pride and prejudice for example, but there is a simplicity and charm that this soap opera pulls off. Not without faults, one being the unattractive pouting of the protagonist and her hard to swallow love of the dreary town of Milton, this series is great for those looking for a heartfelt tale of life and romance in an industrial town of Victorian England.
B009K0P10K|3.0|first season was much better. the main character is getting annoying and her &#34;makeover&#34; from season 1 to 2 is soooo obvious!
B000OXHRRC|3.0|Who would have thought you were so comedic, not quit the physical comedian ala Chaplin or Naomi Watts (see &#34;Ellie Parker&#34;), but very good none the less.  And a very good plot.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Even though we were aware of the conclusion of this movie, the suspense was incredible, and the characters were very interesting. The story may have been embellished, but it worked.
B003DXSXCI|5.0|This is a great film.<br /><br />I've watched this film half a dozen times through the years and it never fails to impress.<br /><br />I't's an economical film, spare, spartan.<br /><br />It's hard, unrelenting, tough, foreboding in a way Clint Eastwood never could be.<br /><br />Everyone in this film was great, but it has to be McQueen's best.<br /><br />And then of course there's the car chase, which has only gotten better with time.<br /><br />One of the most disappointing movie experiences I've had were the chase scenes in &#34;Drive&#34;.<br /><br />I can appreciate the hide and seek elements of the first &#34;Drive&#34; chase scene, but everything after that was absolutely ridiculous.<br /><br />I looked back at &#34;Bullitt&#34; with renewed appreciation.<br /><br />By the way, my complaints about the streaming experience on Amazon vis-a-vie Netflix have all been ameliorated by my puuchase of Roku3.<br /><br />Amazon, I apologize, It wasn't you, it was my Samsung TV software.<br /><br />Bullitt, a great film I hope to enjoy again and again.l
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Friends and family had raved about this series, but we never had the chance to view it while it was on TV  So, after getting two different methods to see the first 2 seasons, it was certainly well worth it to pay for season 3.  We watched this last season in two days, and will anxiously be waiting for the next season to start.  The characters are so interesting, the scenery is beautiful, and the costumes are period early 1900's, as are the vehicles.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like this app it high tech looking and really simple to use. Really cool how you can dim the screen with a swipe of your finger or brighten it up the same way wish there were more clock layouts though.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|I first saw this several decades ago, can't begin to count the number of times I've watched it, am known for making random quotes from it, and when my kids saw it for the first time, they became instant fans as well. Just realized I may have seriously injured the Knights of Nik.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Love this sound - unique! The duets are absolutely my favorites - and &#34;Wrong Song&#34; is now my new anthem!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was a little slow, as was number two, but the ending definitely picked up...so good! I recommend it.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This is a movie about the importance of peer support and friendship while navigating the difficult years of adolescence in search for one's identity.  Each of the three main characters has his/her own issues, with some issues being much darker and difficult to overcome than others.  Yet each character -- at some point -- learns to take a chance and rely on the others' friendship to survive.  They joke, laugh, hurt, and grow thanks to each other, and we do the same, along with them.  This is a very relevant and realistic movie for our times.  And this is not only my opinion but also that of my 19-year-old son, who liked it so much that he's recommended it to several of his friends.
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|My husband says this album is first class & is very pleased with it.<br />Will buy more from this artist
B00B49L7JY|5.0|It is a mystery to me why a singer as good as the shaded, long-haired, mysterious man known only as Rodriguez lived in obscurity all his life, when his songs were so beautiful, electrifying, and moving.<br /><br />He was like a phantom. Here one moment, and the next gone. He released 2 records in the US, and then dropped off the map. But not in South Africa. With the anti-Apartheid movement raging in the early 70's, his anti-structural, anti-establishment based songs struck a cord with the local people. He became more then a legend. Rodriguez outsold Elvis, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan. But no one knew anything about him, or about his death.<br />Did he douse himself with petrol and burn himself to death. Did he shoot himself onstage? Or was the truth far stranger?<br /><br />Searching for Sugar Man is an incredible, beautiful, uplifting, moving, part-heartwarming, part-chilling documentary about the rock icon that never was. This film won the Best Documentary Academy Award, and it deserved it.<br /><br />5 Stars, for Searching for Sugar Man!<br /><br />P.S. If you are looking for heartfelt, deep 70's music, look no further then Rodriguez's 3 albums:<br />[[ASIN:B001B3MCQK Cold Fact]]<br />[[ASIN:B001ZG4J00 Coming From Reality]]<br />[[ASIN:B008DXMXPQ Searching For Sugar Man]]
B0055V0GQC|5.0|this is my new favorite band and this is one of the best albums i have ever heard.  i keep putting this one on repeat and have yet to get tired of hearing it.  (track 6 is the only one that i don't love)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Yes, the material is not very pleasant to try and imagine, but it is a stunning piece of literary art.
B008BZIUHG|5.0|i think that Pressure & Time is still my favorite of their albums but i was definitely disappointed in this one at all!  track 11 leaves me speechless!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is really fun and addicting. They need to make a world at arms 2. The graphics are great. You will love it.
B00BMCLCG6|1.0|I was hoping for something other than sleepy whispering vocals and where is Richie??  The guitar is so minimal for such an amazing player.  The last few albums have been a big letdown and this one is the same way.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is an awesome app.It can keep you busy for hours.Be sure to watch out for the fat policeman and his little dog.Hope you ENJOY!!!!!!
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|I never realized what a large part Scotty played in the original series.  It's also interesting the watch the other characters develop and the story lines move away from 100% Spock/Kirk.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|At first I was so excited about reading it but then I read reviews and thought no I don't even want to. But I finally decided I read the first two and I have to say it was a really good book, all of them were amazing books. I'm actually do sad there are no more but really look forward to the two movies, because the first was also amazing. I fully suggest anyone to read this book. A lot of people wrote bad reviews and at one or points in the book I have to say a was a tiny bit unhappy about it but I did sincerely liked the books and the ending.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book I've read in such a long time!! It just sucks you in and you can't stop reading it. So sad that its the last book. I had the words &#34;The End&#34;.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed the premise and how the story evolved.  I of course loved the<br />ending.  It was the kind of story I seldom read, but it was great.
B0096I9UTE|5.0|Poignant, is the best word for me to describe the album. This must be seen not as a novelty album, but as an actual proof that my girl is a true artist, not just a produced icon.<br />This is Kylie's voice at it's most natural and, as shown by her recent incursion on Holy Motors, Jack & Diane and the Whistle feat. Mum, she is not just a pop singer.<br /><br />The amazing orchestral or acoustic reworks display the best of Kylie, Mr. Steve Anderson and the back up singers and band's skills along with the heartbroken, blissful underlining of the songs and are testament that a good song, can stand the test of time regardless of how many times or how man arrangements of it we get to hear of it.<br /><br />The biggest surprises for me Better the Devil You Know, Slow and the gorgeous Never Too Late. Flower just soars above the bunch and leaves you with a hopeful feeling and Can't Get You Out of My Head is truly reminiscent of a grand Bond performance.<br /><br />Here's to the next #K25 :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Such a good book loved it!! :) I wish there was another one to read this was such a good series!!
B008NW67E0|5.0|The band was a group of unknown people to me, but came my attention thanks to my best friend. After this, I must say that I fell completely in love with the band.<br /><br />Although I think the album may suffer a bit from the same-sounding-song syndrome, in overall it is a lyrical masterpiece of production and an organic follow up to the band's d&eacute;but Sigh No More. I will be anxiously looking forward to album #3 from the boys! :)
B00371XIJE|5.0|Loyalty and love - based on a true story! What an amazing dog.  If you love a good, sappy dog story - this is for you!
B000ZN802W|5.0|Came on time, came in great shape!  I had a hell of a time finding this movie.  I had searched stores all over the place for it and ended up caving and getting it here and I don't regret it.
B0094K1JPC|4.0|If you can imagine Harrison for as a egotistical, contrary, cranky has-been then you have the beginnings of an idea of what this picture is like. It is a fun movie.
B008FPZQQU|5.0|I love this album, and I love Steven Wilson's remastering job.  The bonus tracks are superb in every way.  Buy this album - you won't be disappointed.
B00A7OJ0DC|4.0|Okay, as you can see this review has been preceded by (as I post this) 580 other reviews! But let me guide you through Amazon's review system as well as give you my take on the DVD.<br />Amazon has a general policy of grouping ALL the reviews of a film together and displaying them under all the formats. Reviews start when a film plays in theaters and then often goes to the Amazon Instant (streaming version).  So I often recommend - when posting my reviews - that you sort by \\"most recent\\" first and then look to see which version the reviewer is discussing.  (It's listed under their review.) If you are looking for special features, etc, that will help you. This is a review of the 4-disc 3D Bluray +Blu-ray+ DVD+Digital Copy, but it should guide you in your purchase, I hope.<br />I'm afraid that I can't yet play 3-D discs so I can't help with that disc and the digital copies are now becoming standard as well the standard DVD - which you can play in your PC without a BD drive.<br /><br />The BD comes with four special features which total 42 minutes: There is 16- \\"Bit by Bit\\" where the Disney artists explain the five new \\"Worlds\\" (actually video games) and how each differs. Then come 5 \\"deleted\\" scenes (which are actually the animated storyboard of the scenes which play with - or without - commentary (15 minutes). There are four \\"fake\\" commercials for the new games that appear in the film (2 ½ minutes total). And finally the Academy Award Winning animated short -\\"Paperman\\" (6 minutes). This last bonus has literally nothing to do with anything else on the DVD or BD (other than that it was from Disney studios) but I loved it and glad it's there.<br /><br />As for the film, I came of age before the video game revolution and I really don't frequent arcades so most of the clever nods to early games (okay, I KNOW Pac Man; who doesn't?) but I still enjoyed the humor and wonderful drawing. These characters seemed more real to me than the Toy Story ones from Pixar.  I would have liked a commentary track or comments from the voice over actors. The BD has the \\"intermission feature\\" which can be fun or annoying.  When you press \\"pause\\" \\"host\\" Chris Hardwick comes on and spends a 9 minute/11 \\"chapter\\" loop telling you where to find hidden game references in the film. The problem is that, when you press pause it's usually to answer the phone or leave the room momentarily and want quiet. What you get, however, is Chris chatting away (and not even facing the camera.)<br /><br />Since there are lots of opinions on the film, I'll let you read other views. I just hope this review was helpful in deciding if the 4 disc combo set is what you want.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"liked a commentary track or comments from the voice over actors.

B0050DZ8J0|4.0|I have found this app and the website to be very useful in building connections. One of the few apps I plan on keeping for an extended period of time.
B007HJ9NBE|3.0|Wishing the language had been a bit more PG.  The original was great and did not have this language.  Watch the original instead of this one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love it, was exhilarating ride with Gale getting whipped peers getting captured and more district 12 I can't wait till I read book three :)
B0037NB6QE|3.0|This was an easy read and pretty predictable.  I was hoping for something a little deeper.  Please don't tell me 4 times how the character wears a black leather coat and black leather boots.  I got it the first time.  So many of the character descriptions were repetitive.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't wait to start the last book but I don't want it to end. On to the next one!!
B0018QOIXU|4.0|Adele's first album is jazzier and less polished than 21.  However, It should be enjoyable for any Adele fan and lets you appreciate her musical roots.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Even not overclocked this CPU is GREAT!  Mounted easily, didn't even need directions, and it was my first build.  Literally, anyone with common sense can do it.  Stock fan does a great job keeping it at a cool 35 degrees under light load but under heavy load I have seen it hit 80 degrees, still worked just fine but I might need to get an aftermarket fan for in case I overclock it... but why wouldn't I overclock it, that is the question...
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Well done.  I can now appreciate it more since seeing the movie a few years back.  You almost don't want it to end.
B00BT4N3Q4|5.0|This show is one of my favorite shows ever! Even though it has so many little details and twists, it is easy to remember and keep track of due to the organization and well-writteness of the show. What tops off the enjoyment are the actors. I have read the Pretty Little Liars book and had a good understanding of each character before I started watching the show and the actors portray their character beautifully. From Lucy Hale to Shay Mitchell (my personal favorite), this show has been full of wonderful, heart-felt acting. And most of all, this show is completely and entirely addicting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0094K1MH2|2.0|I have tried to watch this movie 3 times and it never cached my attention.<br />I got myself doing something else In the middle of the movie. Too boring!!!!
B005HEPIDS|5.0|As part of the Star Trek saga Voyager continues to boldly go where no one has gone before.  Strong characters, thoughtful story lines and a plethora of action adventure define this series.
B005LW5J9O|3.0|Although I enjoyed the story I think we could have learned enough in half the pages.  It was interesting to read the history of the papacy during the current selection process.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The instruction manual pictures do not match the camera when it comes up. It is easy to use but the camera page does not have an exit button or return to home icon. Some pictures do not come up in my photo page. The timer works well and zoom is easy to use.
B00846REIS|5.0|See now this book I could actually relate with, unlike Fifty Shades. There was definetly more of a story line and I wanted to follow it. It wasnt all about sex, even though that did play a significant role in their relationship. Very good. I couldnt and didn't want to put the book down!!!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Easy to install and relatively easy to use.  I find it a little difficult to navigate from my Kindle Fire at times, but overall it performs quite well.  My only negative is that it does shuffle up the icons on my desktop and change some default window sizes after using it from the Kindle. And of course you have the normal problems trying to type anything on Kindle without a keyboard, so it's not too useful for any serious input.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend it.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|I love this movie and love to order from amazon cause I always find and get what I need. thanks
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Splashy let's me travel with my Kindle instead of a heavy laptop and access all my files and communicate with my office.<br /><br />Once I learned to download the Splashtop2 software instead of the Splashtop app I was off and running.
B000SEI230|5.0|A Walk to Remember was a sad but spiritual rewarding book.  I didn't want the book to end, I wanted it to continue.  I couldn't stop reading it once I started.
B00ARA4SLU|2.0|Glad I saw this as a S.A.G. preview DVD, rather than paying good money in a theater. During the entire viewing, I felt I was watching Anthony Hopkins (an actor I admire greatly in other films) give a fairly good physical impression of Alfred Hitchcock, while, when I closed my eyes, all I could hear was Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter (\\"Silence of the Lambs\\") speaking. Having watched all ( or nearly all) the \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\\" TV shows over the years and now again in cable reruns and complete DVD season collections, I believe I have a good ear for Hitchcock's droll, veddy-British delivery well. The voice Hopkins gave us wasn't even close. All I can add to this review is a droll, veddy-British: \\"Good evening.\\"
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I started reading Safe Haven and couldn't put it down.  I really enjoyed it.  I love Nichols settings in North Carolina.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|This year was our first Lego purchase for our daughter who just turned 6.  The Lego Bricks & More is a great addition to the Olivia's Friends Lego sets!  (a MUST HAVE in my opinion!)<br />Even thinking about ordering another one.....  8)<br />I would highly recommend this item to anyone with kids ages 5 & up.  (some of the smaller pieces could be swallowed by younger kids.  ~ or dogs!! Definitely keep away from the dogs!  Our dog doesn't chew on things, but for some reason, he decided that the pink Legos looked tasty!!  LoL!!)<br />Long live Legos!!  8)
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I have read this several times and I can never get bored reading it. If you like military history this is a book you have to read
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I guess I'm just not that tweet savy, I don't get it. Maybe I'm too old. It doesn't really work for me. =(
B007REV4YI|5.0|I've been a fan of Bond since I was 12. I clearly remember how I felt with all his movies. Skyfall is absolutely one of the greatest films ever. This blu-ray version brings even more emotions because of its clear image and astonishing scenes.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|fabulous book, the best I've read since The Secret Life of Bees. Heartbreaking at times but so filled with hope!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this app. I take it every where with me. my favorite part is that I can play it at school and my teachers just watch me play!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I found the book difficult to read as the depiction of an abusive relationship was so realistic.  The reader can truly empathize with the protagonist and her difficulties in resuming a &#34;normal&#34; life.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Just received it today and can't say enough about the quality of this charger. If teh preformance matches the quality I will be ordering a few fo rmy family.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Vic and his crew start the series as mildly crooked cops, and they just get worse.  In Season two, an episode called \\"Co-pilot\\" flashes back to Vic's first day on the job and his first step over the line and down the slippery slope. Watching flawed men struggle with morality and lose makes for facinating TV.<br /><br />This is a great beginning to a series that unsurprisingly ran for seven years.  I recommend the entire run.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|For those of you who like Downton Abbey, you should check out Call the Midwife. Both shows are great! Yep.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a fun read with many ups and downs to keep you intrigued and invested. Couldn't put it down :)
