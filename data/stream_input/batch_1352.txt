B006PHD0RW|5.0|I just downloaded. I love this game some much! !!!!!!!! I play it all the time... my dieter keeps begging me to play !?!?!?!!!. i love u bag it!!!!
B0019N8P2W|4.0|I love Daria soooooooo much! I know what you're thinking. Then what the \\"but.....\\" about? Well I waited a week for it to get here and it cost me a good 30 bucks, and it was also from my christmas money. And then, I take it out of the package and the cover's all messed up! I know, I know. Not a big deal, I can live with it. But, if that wasn't enough, I open it so my dad and I can watch some together and the things that hold the discs? Are completely broken! They fell out completely!!!!! The only reason I'm not upset enough to kill amazon is that the show is priceless. The best show in the world. And I'm not being sarcastic.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|this game had some good levels. I like how difficult some are. I got frustrated a lot which is what made me keep playing it because I was determined to beat it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Works great on my rooted Viewsonic Gtablet!  This game is the first I've reviewed, but will do more.  Animation is great, characters are cute, physics is good, and gameplay is fun and challenging.  I'll be looking at other apps by the developer.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I wasn't too sure about this game at first. But now I must say it's a lot of fun! Great job! And please don't take too long to add more levels!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think the game is great so far. I have had no problems with it, except the having to always go back and forth and all the ads for other games.  But, I find the game itself to be quite entertaining.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|The Kindle Fire Zip Sleeve does exactly what I wanted it to do.  It protests the entire Kindle Fire including the ports and buttons when it is in my purse or carry-all.  It is flat enough to hold in back of the Kinde Fire while I am using it.
B000RUAR5G|5.0|This is without a doubt the greatest movie about cartoon characters playing basketball with Michael Jordan that I have ever seen.
B004O7ZYBU|4.0|I haven't read any of the books that this mini series is made from, but I will now.  The story is fun to follow and imaginative, reminding me a little of The Baron Münchhausen.  I'll never forget the first time I heard the story about the little old lady who scolded a young scientist for testing her belief that the flat Earth rested on the back of a giant turtle (in \\"A Brief History of Time\\".)  This movie does that story justice and makes something unique with that as a detail.
B006PHD0RW|2.0|Unless you're on an ICS ROM. First and second level work, and work very well. Once you get to the score screen after the second level, though, it freezes and crashes.  Really fun game, otherwise.
B00006B1HH|5.0|We had lost our VHS version of this movie a long time back and one evening my five year old grandson saw a portion of the song Greased Lightening on cable and wanted to watch it all.  It was bed time so this was not an option for him.  We looked at our local super store and no copies were available so we ordered here.  In the past months he has watched this movie dozens of times, forgoing his Nickelodeon and/or Disney time.  He loves it, knows all the songs and most of the dances by heart. What a great deal...for less than $8 we purchased a used dvd that has provided hours of enterainment for him and memories for me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really have found app to great.  I use it often.  I love the fact that it can read the verses to you.  great for those hard to say name.
1591841666|2.0|Didn't hate this, but didn't necessarily like it, either. Godin has an engaging writing style and this book is a quick read but it's more full of feel good self help style sayings than practical, applicable knowledge and tips.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great game.  Runs awesome and smooth.  Lots of levels.  Needs a pretty good device to run it.  Reviewed on Samsung Galaxy Nexus... a REAL high end phone.  1 star reviews because your phone sucks are stupid.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Its addicting, funand great for all different ages. I have had it for only a couple of days and im still working on beating it. It has cute graphics and animations, fun characters and many different skill levels and games. It is a need to have!
B003UD7JEE|5.0|I don't know why I waited so long to get this show. For those unfamiliar to the original \\"La Femme Nikita\\", this version is similar to \\"Alias\\", but better. The characters are fun, plot lines are diverse, and the story arc is complex. Nikita is a refreshing break from reality garbage and episodic fodder. You will not regret this show. It is a keeper.
B0063IH60K|4.0|nice bonus features on this classic game. easy to use. nice that you can change settings to fit your preferences.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I bought this when it was Amazon's Deal of the Day, dropping down to twenty-eight bucks.  Now that I have it, it feels like I stole it at that price.  It's worth the regular reduced price, for sure.<br /><br />Not only does this set come with the full DVD AND the full, brilliant BluRay packed with extra features, it also offers a CD soundtrack of the music, a hardcover book, a hand-painted music box that plays The Sound of Music, a reprint of the 1965 Theatrical Souvenir Book, snapshot photos from around Salzburg, and an official Letter of Authenticity.<br /><br />This is a limited edition, numbered collector's set.  This is not just the film.  The box is about the size of a board game, and is packed full of content.  If you're a serious lover of this classic film, this is the set to get.  You will not be disappointed.
1401223176|5.0|This is hands down one of the best comic stories I have ever read. Definately a classic. I liked seeing several of Batman's biggest villains and the newer villain Hush is pretty interesting. I would recommend this to any Batman or even comic fan.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I LOVE Angry Birds! But this little strategy game is even better, if that's possible. It has the same structure and feel as Angry Birds. But instead of shooting and aiming, this game is based on ropes, bubbles and gravity. Cute and addicting! Just try it, you'll love it!
B00005N5RM|4.0|This movie always scared the crap out of me as a kid and most (but not all) of the FX still hold up pretty well. If you like creepy, slimy alien creatures this is the way to go.
B004WJV6OY|5.0|Beautiful this DVD, Eddie is a very charismatic, to say that this movie is a perfect blend of stand up comedy and a great musician! Buy!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|What an amazing movie.  I never realized just how mean they treated maids.  Wonderful ending when they finally get their say.  Fantastic acting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it so alsome I like can't get off if it like it so cool I would so tell allot my friend to get this but I steady have it
1595827684|1.0|This review would be 5 stars. The art is beautiful; some of the best concept art in contemporary gaming. The book is quite long as well, spanning all three Mass Effect games, chalk full of iteration and exploration. But I find it shameful, detestable that not a single one of the extraordinarily talented concept artists is credited anywhere in this book. It is as if the art materialized out of nothing due to the acumen and brilliance of the Executive Producer and Art Director alone. It is pathetic and I cannot endorse such a scathing insult to craft of concept art.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fun and its good for just wasting time. xD I think that you would enjoy it and it doesn't seem like there's anything wrong with the app.
B004UID2LC|5.0|it was aaaaaaamasing. makes me smile. I love iiit broskay. it gives me helly good music for free hombre. oh yes
0316056871|5.0|I don't typically read biographies, so I was nervous about trying this one, but I'm so glad I did. This is a relatively short \\"overview\\" of Tina's life and career, and it is hilarious. It's full of the same off-beat sarcasm that makes me love her SNL and 30 Rock writing--with a good dose of \\"Go Get 'Em Girl!\\"
B004XNGKBS|5.0|I am amazed at how well this app stores my own handwriting! It makes it very easy to make notes.
B005MMYNZE|5.0|Great prequel from a great series. The prequel \\"Gods of the Arena\\" will not disappoint you. Being able to see how the characters have evolved during their time at the house of Batiatus is quite interesting and entertaining.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great game that is fun and addictive. I love it and I am having so much fun playing it. The levels are not all that hard but some can make you think about how the bag could be packed.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|I loved this book, and found it very encouraging and full of funny, true-to-life stories.<br />A great way to start off your minimalist journey, just enough to be informative, but not too much to scare you off.<br />The only thing I can think of that I wished was discussed was Minimalist with a family.<br />Coming from only a two-income, working couple, most of the suggestions really didn't apply to my family lifestyle.<br />Still, I enjoyed it immensely.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the option to pick a winning game and the smoothness of the game. Would definitely recommend downloading it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome. I love playing this game when I am bored. :) I like to play the sushi game most
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's a game-changer in todays world to help people connect more with God's Word.  Best Bible app in my opinion.
087033039X|4.0|It is hard to find good leather work books.  This one is very good for beginners and old timers as well.  Some things were easy to understand and some took a little work.
1609611543|5.0|I am a primary care physician and I successfully treat diabetes and other obesity-related illnesses every single day with the sort of wheat-free low-carb advice that Dr. Davis gives here in this excellent book.  I started recommending this about 15 years ago and have seen countless patients \\"cure\\" their diabetes and stop diabetes medications with this sort of dietary modification.  Thanks Dr. Davis for such a well-written book, I recommend it to people all the time!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started this book not knowing what to really expect, over four of my closest friends recommended to me that this was a book I MUST read. I have to say The Hunger Games totally threw me. I was so shocked that a book about kids killing kids came so highly recommended. I starting the book not knowing how I felt about it, the main story line insisted that 24 will enter and only 1 will leave. I find it hard to get into a story where I know that everyone you come into contact will have to eventually die. I still can't tell you how I actually feel about this book, the story is so creative and so original. This story will haunt me for the rest of my live. I found myself unable to put this book down for even a moment. I was so worried that I couldn't sleep through the night without finding out happened with Katniss and Peeta. I was so upset that children were killing each other and so tortured by the thought that this was their governments punishment for the rebellion of district 13. I was so touched by Katniss' sacrifices and Peeta's love. This story is unbelievable and so believable at the same time its hard to come to terms with story line. But I fell in love with the characters and found myself trying to put myself in their place trying to think of ways to help them. Sorry this is so vague but I wouldn't ruin this story line for anything. It was shocking and surprising and wonderful it will leave you biting your fingers begging for more of Petta and Katniss, and hoping and praying that they survive.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I love playing this game. The tables are super fun and unique. I've.never had any problems running the app or anything, either. Great game!
0307888908|3.0|Silicon valley venture capitalist offers career advice for individuals who aren't venture capitalists.  Kind of reminds me of Mitt Romney claiming to be unemployed in an effort to relate to unemployed people.<br /><br />Book has some useful career tips about networking and is written in an engaging, conversational style. Undermined by overeaching promotion of Linked-in.
0316286869|5.0|I purchased Making Faces by Kevyn Aucoin from Amazon in perfect condition as described. The book is loaded with valuable information about how to apply makeup with pictures. Fast shipping and amazing excellent packaging. Item arrived in perfect condition. Very reasonable pricing.
B005Y423ZC|4.0|Adele's voice is beautiful and she has a God-given talent in that golden voice.  The only problem I have with watching the video is that she talks way too much and has quite a potty mouth (that's why only 4 stars).  Luckily the audio CD included in this set doesn't have her speaking other than to say, \\"thank you\\" a couple of times.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Yes, Adele has many years ahead of her; however, no, she's not the soulful, Amy Winehouse, Etta James or the crooners Frank, Dean or Tony; She is good and will mature but not my cup of tea. We'll see what the future holds.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Rough start to this book.  Barrons is dead and Mac is devasted.<br /><br />Most everything is answered in this final book in the series.  This is the best series I have ever read with Barrons being my favorite alpha male.<br /><br />I truly hope Iced lives up to this high quality and we get to see a little more of Barrons and Mac.
B0052U59F4|4.0|I finished the book.<br />I know I would have finished a lot sooner if I had the time. The book for me was really good. I won't say great because I had some minor issues. But I couldn't give it less than four stars because the overall story was a great one. I love dysfunction in books. And this story had that for sure!<br />Fifty shades of Grey is not a book that I would have ever thought of reading. I have seen the cover everywhere. It's not even the content that scared me away. I just never was attracted to the cover or had it jump out at me. The reason I finally said what the heck, was by accident when a woman on Goodreads said she was reading it and how much she loved it. This made me look closer, and seeing all the listopia votes about Christian Grey, I had to take a chance. I like great characters.<br />The story was very raw. So much so you felt like a perverted fly on the walk taking in things you really shouldn't. Sometimes I was shaking my head and confused why I was into this book. A lot like Anastasia I suppose.<br />The one thing this book does is create a character that you can't help but love. Everything about Christian tells you to run away. You couldn't fall for a person like this, but it's his soft side that is buried deep that slowly comes to the surface as Ana and him get to know each other. I was dying to know why he was the way he was and what she could do to fix it. By the end of the read I wanted to hug him and make things okay, which he would hate.<br />The story was great, I loved every chapter. I think the pace was killer. Everything unfolded just the way I wanted it to. The one thing I was wishing for seemed to evolve as the story went along. And this kept me happy.<br />As for any complaints, my only ones was the sometimes cheesy wording when it came to the sexual acts. Maybe it's just me, but normal people don't talk in that way. I like the wording to be believable and there were time I didn't feel what she said to him or vice versa.<br />I also think I could have done without a lot of Anastasia phrasings. They seemed to occur time and time again. I think those could have been switched up a little.<br />I thought the inner goddess was funny for the first fifty percent of the book. But after awhile she just got old. Soon I found myself wishing Ana would borrow some of Christian's rope to bound and gag her so she would shut up. I get it was probably the authors way of letting us see inside the mind of Ana and her thoughts on this strange lifestyle she was partaking in, but it got old.<br />The ending was a punch in the face. It shattered my heart. It was so real and emotional, I loved it! Now I am dying to start the next.<br />The author has really created a story that is more than just sex. Some might be shocked, but if you really read this book you will see it's more than that. This book has so much going for it. You won't be disappointed. If you are looking for a character that you love to hate, I would say give this book a shot. Although I didn't ever hate Christian I felt for him. But he did have a very very dark side.<br />Anyone sensitive to sex in books steer clear, because this more than just average sex. This is way beyond. But if you want a story that keeps you reading and sweeps you off your feet in a really bad way, then this is the book for you!<br />Great job!!done without a lot of Anastasia phrasings.

B005LAJ1H2|5.0|My wife & I enjoyed season 1 very much. Attention to detail, from the characters & setting. I only hope that season 2 stays on course, and does not deviate from actual events. The set-up of how the \\"Mob\\" took root in the \\"Roaring Twenties\\" is quit facinating !You have a winner in our household !!!  Grateful in Lakewood, Colorado
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a creative puzzle game that has fantastic graphics and music and sound effects.  Very impressed with the game play and the neat and unexpected twists.  Run great on the Xoom + ICS.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Let me just start by saying that this is an amazing app to have if you love apps that have more than one game on them!!!! I play on this app at least two times a day!!!! I love it and it is so addicting!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it b/c it reminds u to read and it has several reading plans to change up your routine. It has everything.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|All these one star reviews regarding the UV copy is just ridiculous. Critique the movie not the copy that is included. Hangover II is hysterical and better than the first or at least as good. I don't know what other one star reviewers were expecting with the movie having the same title and characters. Yes it's the same but more realized and capitalizes on what made the first film great. Now I know this does not always work, take a sequel like Grease II or Jaws II which are not really comedies...well Jaws II was pretty funny considering how bad it was compared to the first. The point is that Galifianakis is a genious and one of the funniest actors and comedians around and the rest of the cast is brilliant as well. I don't care that it's the same premise and in fact I would be very disappointed if it wasn't.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|LOVE this game. it works great on the Kindle Fire and it's so challenging so I know that I won't get bored and just stop playing it. and I know that I wont beat it too soon. definitely makes you think and is a real time killer.
B0050DIWHU|5.0|This book managed to do for career management what books like The Personal MBA did for business fundamentals: become the place to start. I've recommended this book to almost everyone I know that is going through some sort of professional crossroad, because it shows impressive comprehension of the realities of the job market nowadays. I was looking for a book that would stress the importance of concepts like serendipity, uncertainty, diversity and network intelligence when thinking of career decisions, and The Start-up of You does a great job at this. The lesson comes through: we need to manage our careers with the same principles that a start-up does to get ahead in the XXI century. 100% recommended.
0446579939|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. couldnt put it down. Cant wait to read books from this author.  Love reading all these books on my kindle

B005I4JG80|5.0|This is not a how-to book, and yet, after reading it, I feel suddenly equipped to face all the many daily challenges my 20-month-old daughter throws at me. The thing this book made me realize was that I am already equipped with the necessary tools. I was just too afraid/confused/exhausted/frustrated/hopeless to use them.<br /><br />What caught my attention about this book was Druckerman's assertion that Americans tend to blame a child's good or bad behavior on temperament, whereas the French assume patience can be taught to anyone. I often say, \\"My child has been this way since she was two weeks old.\\" She's always been a very alert, active, charming, rebellious, impatient child. I believed it was my fate to never be able to take her in a store without enduring a temper tantrum. I was mostly hopeless that I would ever be able to control the force of nature that is my child.<br /><br />Then I found Druckerman's book. I stayed up until 3 a.m. reading it because the middle of the night is the only time my child lets me get anything done. Aside from the parenting stuff, it was a fun read, an expatriate memoir (which I always enjoy) with a sense of humor and a gossipy inside look at the lives of other parents of toddlers from the U.S. and France.<br /><br />But what makes me rate this book five stars is the parenting information. The French (or the segment of the French population Druckerman is describing) all share one philosophy on parenting, which boils down to teaching patience, not hovering, not feeling guilt over every little thing, and having confidence. Something about the idea of ONE philosophy made me feel so relieved. I've read about every kind of parenting philosophy there is, to the point that I almost never had confidence I was doing the right thing. I had too many questions, too much conflicting advice in my head. If I don't give her a snack when she wants one, am I creating an issue with food? If I stop her from tearing around the store like a maniac, am I crushing her will? The French would say no - teaching limits and not giving in IS a way of respecting your child.<br /><br />I know my child could tell I lacked conviction all this time. Now she can tell I don't anymore. I woke up the morning after reading this book, feeling for the first time that I actually had the power to improve my child's behavior and make life easier for us all. Already, my daughter's behavior is remarkably better, after implementing a few of the philosophies in this book (and the breakfast-lunch-snack-dinner schedule) for only a few days. There is much less whining, no full-blown tantrums, no begging for sweets constantly, and she enthusiastically ate her brown rice and broccoli lunch today! I haven't yelled once or had to put her in time out, which makes me happier and less stressed out. The best part is SHE seems happier, too. We even went to the grocery store tonight without a single meltdown!<br /><br />Edited to add a follow-up!<br /><br />My daughter I talked about in this review is now 2.5 years old, and I have a new 2-month-old daughter. I had big plans to follow the French rules for getting the baby to sleep through the night - so far unsuccessful, but it's early yet! My older daughter is still a \\"very alert, active, charming, rebellious, impatient child,\\" and she still throws a tantrum or two every day. But I do still feel better, calmer, less out of control of the situation, and I think this book helped with that. When I re-read this review just now for the first time in months, I was surprised to read how hopeless and out of control I felt back then. I don't feel that way anymore. That's probably some of my own doing, and some my child growing up a bit, but I do think this book helped me get started on a better path. I think the key thing I gleaned from this book is to relaaaaax and not put so much pressure on myself to be perfect. I feel more like one of the French moms in this book, not consumed by guilt all the time (though of course I still feel it sometimes!).f course I still feel it sometimes!).
B006PHD0RW|2.0|simple gameplay, fun for awhile then terrible. really bad controls, but overall it's worth it. (free) I would never pay for this app, but a good two minute entertainment.
B005HSL626|5.0|VERY COOL THANK GOODNESS FOR THIS GAME CUZ OTHER WISE ID HAVE TO SLICE FRUITS IN REAL LIFE! !!!! THANK YOU FOR THIS REALLY COOL GAME EVERYONE. !!!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game,its so addicting its like u want to play with it all day.Its just like where's my water but its free.Whoever says this is stupid.........WELL THEY ARE WRONG
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love everything about all the games.I could play it for hours and not get sick of it.Im not looking forward to the end so I hope there is more to come.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|Cute and fun. Can be challenging. Doesn't recognize item flip moves very well. 20 sec timer seems to not work on the rare times that I could get all of the flips to work quickly to fill the memorized (trust me) level. I think I did it in half that time. No medal.
B005HSL626|1.0|this game was fun until I played one game of arcade mode and now it is frozen and won't let me play it anymore. so it was kind of disappointing.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|Just wondering and maybe some of you can email these video companies as to who came up with this LARGE case for DVDs. The disk is the same as a CD yet they use all this extra plastic, why not in jewel cases. Now to cut costs they are making cases thinner and cutting out this recycle symbol. If they use jewel cases there is less plastic, not to mention they could use the same cover art as the soundtrack that is in a jewel case. Most look the same as the DVD. Another point is if you look at storage units, they hold 3 or 4 times as many CDs as they do DVDs. 2 DVDs are bigger than 1 VHS tape. Anyone else but me wonder about this???
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love this game! Soooo addicting! I play it every day, sorry boyfriend, but thanks for the Kindle! Everyone needs to get it!  It's. so hard to put it down once you start.
0439023521|5.0|THE HUNGER GAMES<br />Suzanne Collins<br />Young Adult Futuristic Dystopian<br />Paperback version reviewed<br />Review by Willa Kaye Danes, author at Penumbra Publishing<br /><br />I had heard many wonderful things about this book, but avoided for a long time reading it because of the subject matter, thinking that it certainly wouldn't end well. When I finally did get the opportunity to read THE HUNGER GAMES, after having read many short and rather ho-hum, even disappointing novels billed as young-adult, I found it difficult to believe THE HUNGER GAMES is a young-adult novel. It certainly doesn't fit in the category of `ho-hum,' and it doesn't rely on paranormal or supernatural bells and whistles as a crutch to build character and suspense. Told in first-person present tense through the female protagonist Katniss Everdeen, THE HUNGER GAMES made an immediate and lasting impression. Upon reading the first couple pages, I devoured this book (pun intended). And my eagerness to finish it in no way was diminished by the knowledge that it would have to end, because the ending held up to my best expectations, even though it certainly paved the way for the sequel.<br /><br />In case you haven't read the more than 4,000 customer reviews on Amazon (the majority of them glowing), I will briefly summarize the plot. However much I wish it to be true, this review can in no way give proper praise to this book.<br /><br />In the not-too-distant future, sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen lives with her mother and twelve-year-old sister Prim in District 12, what was once part of Appalachia in former United States of America, but is now one of the cordoned-off and policed areas of Panem, carved out after a quashed rebellion. In this future, people in outlying districts don't fare too well. Food is rationed and scarce for the outlying districts, and only the relatively well-to-do can afford heat and food enough to ward off Mr. Death. People are afraid to speak their mind for fear of being overheard by those evil bastards in Capital City.<br /><br />In Capital City, the streets might as well be paved with gold when compared to the living arrangements of Kat and her family and most others in the outer districts. But after her father dies in a coal mining accident, Kat carries on the illegal task of `poaching' - hunting in the unfenced forest outside the district to bring game home for trade and to feed her family. She and her hunting partner, an eighteen-year-old boy named Gale, have forged an alliance that benefits almost everyone in the district with extra food, and profitable trading eases the rules that would otherwise be imposed by the resident Peacekeepers.<br /><br />Once a year, Capital City `reminds' the other districts of their transgression of failed rebellion with the hugely promoted fanfare of The Hunger Games. Each district is required to furnish one girl and one boy between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the survival game, which is to the death, with only one winner. That victory ensures the winner of an easy life and benefits of more food and other extras for the winner's district. Kat has put in extra entries for herself in the lottery in exchange for extra portions of food and heating fuel for her family throughout the year. She waits tensely to see whose name is chosen for this year's games. When her sister's name is called, she immediately volunteers to go in her place.<br /><br />Words fail me in trying to describe how absolutely perfect this story is. It is not simply the story itself, but the unique blend of plot, character development, and beautiful economy of words that all worked wonderfully together to make this an entirely believable and absorbing read. Many an author gets blinded by the light of a well-turned phrase, but Ms. Collins stays true to her writing task in that the writing skill remains invisible so the reading pleasure can be fully realized.<br /><br />It has been, as I stated before, a verylong time since I have read a young-adult novel-length story that was so emotionally moving without being over-dramatic or maudlin. Kat is the perfect heroine - tough and emotionally distant, yet in her own way caring and respectful of life. The way her attitudes and beliefs are pitted against the very fabric of the opulently excessive society that created the situation certain to cause her death is a stroke of writing genius. I am eager to see it repeated in the next installment of this trilogy, and can't wait to get my hands on the rest of this series. Also I will be standing in line to see the movie version of this story and compare it to the graceful success of this book.<br /><br />This is the kind of story that any author would be grateful and proud to have written, and it is an excellent example of superb writing.

B006BG7RI0|5.0|One of my two most faourite films, the other being The Big Sleep. I can watch these two over and over along with Maltese Falcon and Key Largo. True classics. Also have a love affair with African Queen but that's a film of a different colour.  But though its great that you have sharpened the print on blu-ray and no doubt have many extra features, I still crave for the day when the colourised versions of these films are released. I know...sacrilege. But I've seen 'em in colour and I luv 'em in colour. Could deepen the friendship.
B005HS00NW|5.0|Yes, music is all subjective and everybody has an opinion, but I am a picky listener who is constantly in search of something that hits me in the \\"spot\\", and for me, M83's \\"Hurry Up...\\" is simply perfect.  Anthony Gonzalez and all of the resources he pulls together for this album simply works on many levels for me.  Happy, sad, rich, deep, fun and at times a \\"lushness\\" that is a guilty pleasure.  I'm a newcomer to M83, and this was apparently a great introduction.  And yes, there's certainly an 80's feel on this from time to time, but not in an overbearing way.  I've played samples of this for associates who range from 19 to 45, and they have all responded quite favorably, if not with full and wide-eyed enthusiasm.  If you are looking for a bit of a musical adventure, without the unpleasant surprises, I offer my highest recommendations here.  Hurry up.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great fun. Simple but very addicting! Got it free but it would be worth buying. Can't put it down. A must have.
B005OZ4EVW|5.0|I bought this for my wife to give her in Valentines. She was excited and heard the whole cd that same night. She said Laura Pausini hasn't missed a beat. The album is great.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works great on Kindle Fire! Very informative and looks great. I would give it five stars, but every once in a while it will force close.  Not enough to uninstall, but enough to aggravate you a little.
B0053O89KG|1.0|While I am not be sure that the 4 session will come subtitled or translated into Spanish does not make sense to buy the session 3. I stand to be 2 and ends my interest in Castle.  Why the version 4 only in English? with that leave out an important market .... the Spanish-speaking that is almost all Latin America and Spain.   In my opinion this situation is so much rare   Amazon should not offer the 3  session if the 4 will not be seen by those who do not speak fluent English resulting in misleading the consumer here in Chile is punishable by law .   Hopefully this note has a satisfactory   Atte   Patrick Hanssen
B006PHD0RW|2.0|I really liked this game for the first few levels, but the &quot;tap to rotate&quot; feature does not work at all.  It would be a great game otherwise, but timed levels cannot be completed because you can't rotate the items quickly.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I like this game. It's fun, a little challenging  and it's cute. I like the little grocery characters. Love it when Amazon puts a free game like this out.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I had heard BEFORE I bought this movie that it is simply amazing! I couldn't wait until I could get it! We have rented and purchased several of the movies made by this church. They do such a phenomenal job!  The presentation of God's word provided by the actors/actresses, and the portrayal of the story is sensational. We laughed and we cried.  We were left in awe of the grandeur and grace of our Lord presented here.  They inspire, with their accurate interpretation of the feelings and thoughts, and give hope. I pray they continue to share the gospel thru movies.  I know I will contiue to purchase them, and watch them repeatedly. Keep up the great work you are doing!! We look forward to your next project!
B004XE0P5E|5.0|Here comes the backlash.  Yes there has been a lot of hype surrounding Bon Iver so please know this: this music is not for everyone.  It does not rock.  It is beautiful, complex, and challenging, but it does not rock and you cant really dance to it.  Justin's voice is probably somewhat of an acquired taste (if you don't like falsetto stay away).  The songs are atmospheric and you have to be in the right mood (some may find it a bit slow) but the lyrics, vocals, production, everything is just heartfelt and you can tell this was a labor of love.  Every time you listen to these songs you will hear something new.  I often listen to the first 4 songs over and over again because they are just so great.  The second half of the album probably slows down a bit, but there is always the payoff of Beth/Rest.  It is too bad that the album does seem to elicit hatred from some people, but again, I think that's a reaction to overhype at this point.  It was good to see Justin win two Grammys and his speech (recognizing musicians and bands who will never be at the Grammys) was even better.  Love this album.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very well designed, fun to play, and challenging enough to make you want to figure it out. Very addictive. I really enjoy this game, it's made it to my favorites carousal on my Kindle!
B005LL4TW8|4.0|Wanting a complete set of Mozart string quartets so that I could hear quartets 1-13, I was happy when this set was reissued in remastered sound. However, as good as the playing is--and it is quite good--the recorded sound is so strange as to be distracting. In the early quartets the miking sounds quite close, yet with annoyingly long and artificial sounding reverb during the silences. The recording quality is better in quartets 14-23, maybe a different venue? Different recording engineers? In any case, I sold my set at the used record store in town and bought the Italian Quartet's complete Mozart set. Their playing can be a bit stodgy in the early quartets (especially minuets), but is glorious in the late quartets. For quartets 14-23 the Teldec recordings of the Alban Berg Quartet are still my favorite. I'm still searching for a great recording of the early quartets. I wish the Quatuor Mosaiques would record them.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Love it! Addictive and fun. Not since angry birds have I been hooked on a game like I have with this one. This is a high quality produced game. Great graphics. Can't believe it was free but it deserves the promotion. Excellent on the Kindle Fire. Definitely for adults and children alike.
B0076OW9DE|5.0|CD just arrived.  Love it.  Refreshing choice of songs from the Great American Songbook that are not covered by everyone else.  Great music gets you singing and dancing.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|this is a good alternate for holding your camera..your hands will get plenty of rest using this device..made of sturdy plastic which makes it light..its holds up well..do not treat this rough as it can break..also be carefull putting in and out of your bag..as the rubber on the botton started to peel off..quick fix with a dot of gorilla glue..nontheless good item..so far i am happy
B005LAIGMI|3.0|I am a big fan of director Steven Soderbergh. He is one of a very small handful of directors who work in a wide range of genres and consistently try out new things; he really pushes his artistic abilities and doesn't seem content to make similar films. But I have noticed a trend in his films. For every great, accomplished, interesting film, there are two or three films leading up to it that fall short, he seems to be using these two or three other films to try out the artistic ideas and devices, perfecting them for his next \\"Erin Brockovich\\", his next \\"Traffic\\", his next \\"Out of Sight\\". Some of these 'starter' films turn out to be good and have a life of their own. Others, are quickly forgotten when the more interesting, higher profile films are released and start to earn praise.<br /><br />\\"Haywire\\" is one of those 'starter' films. But it has a significant problem that will all but ensure it is ultimately forgotten.<br /><br />The story goes that Soderbergh saw Mixed Martial Artist Gina Carano and decided that he wanted to make a movie to showcase her talents. Lem Dobbs, a frequent collaborator, wrote a screenplay and they made this film.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that the film feels like a showcase. It seems like a series of set-ups to show us the MMA stars various moves. It doesn't feel like a movie with a real, significant plot or narrative.<br /><br />Mallory (Carano) walks into a diner in upstate New York and seems to take solace in the brief moment of respite and the cup of coffee that comes with it. But the moment is short-lived. Aaron (Channing Tatum) arrives and states that he is taking her back. But she doesn't want to go, so they get into a no-holds barred fight and do a lot of damage to each other and the diner. Mallory manages to escape and convinces Scott (Michael Angarano), a local kid, to let her use his car. As they escape, she tells him the story leading up to the confrontation in the diner. Two men (Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas) hire a Black Ops company run by Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) to retrieve a journalist being held hostage in Barcelona. They insist Mallory be a member of the team, because they want her expertise, her skills. Things don't go as planned and Mallory is determined to take out the people responsible. This leads her to track the men responsible from Barcelona to Dublin to New York to New Mexico.<br /><br />From the moment the film begins, you get the feeling the filmmakers want to create the female equivalent of a typical Jackie Chan or Jet Li film, the type of film that thrusts the martial arts stars into a decidedly North American world and narrative, to give them the opportunity to show off their stuff and become an international star. The difference here is that Jackie Chan's films are usually presented with a wink and a nudge clueing us into the fact the filmmakers aren't taking the material all that seriously. Li's films are usually more serious and definitely less enjoyable because you have more trouble believing in them. One of the problems with \\"Haywire\\" is that it takes everything very, very seriously. Because of this, we are looking for and in need of a narrative that helps us believe everything we are watching. And Dobbs creates a cliff notes version of the narrative that we need for this film to work.<br /><br />Carano has an undeniable intensity about her and may have a career playing female vigilante types, the strong, silent, warrior-type. I don't see her playing emotionally complex roles, because there is simply no hint of that type of ability in this performance. I definitely see her as part of the Keanu Reeves School; the less acting required the better. Allow her to stare pensively at another character or at the horizon, and you can believe she is deep in thought, plotting the next step of her revenge against those responsible for her predicament.<br /><br />The impressive cast of actors playing the men in Mallory's life are all pretty boring and even wasted. Antonio Banderas plays Rodrigo who may have an ulterior motive in hiring the black ops company Mallory works for. Or he may not. Either way, he simply stands to one side and seems to watch the proceedings as if he is watching a television show he is more interested in. During much of the film, his face is covered in a big, wooly beard. Then, it disappears, thankfully, for his last scene. Michael Douglas plays Coblenz, a CIA operative who may also have ulterior motives. At one point, he makes a blatant play for Mallory to join his forces. In doing so, he reveals more about his character and makes him a little more interesting. Michael Fassbender, the new \\"It\\" kid, plays an MI-6 operative paired with Mallory in Dublin. Their characters have the big fight in the hotel suite featured prominently in the trailer. This moment also leads to a lengthy and interesting chase sequence through the streets of Dublin. But his character barely registers. There is a scene late in the film between Fassbender and McGregor that is meant to illustrate how the \\"It\\" Kid plays a role in the story. This is another example of Soderbergh playing with timelines; chronologically this scene happens much earlier than we watch it. Channing Tatum plays Aaron. He and Carano share the most screen time together and there are hints to a relationship. But still, his character doesn't really register all that well. Tatum has six, SIX, really at least six new films, coming out this year. He's really good looking, but I have seen little evidence that he can act. I hope that one of these new films catches on or he will definitely be overexposed and people may begin to wonder what all of the fuss was about. Bill Pullman plays Mallory's dad, an ex-Marine who now enjoys a Tom Clancy-esque life as a writer living in New Mexico. His character seems so inconsequential it is almost mind-numbing. He is included to give Mallory some sort of humanity. But it doesn't work. His character is far too cold and distant, her character is too cold and distant and what happens at his house seems to shock even him. It seems difficult for either of them to show any emotion towards one another, so why should we invest any time in the relationship? What's the point?<br /><br />Ewan McGregor plays Kenneth, the man in charge of the company Mallory works for. They seem to have a close relationship and it quickly becomes apparent that Kenneth is behind the scenes, pulling the strings, but it is never really clear why he is pulling those strings, trying to manipulate Mallory's life. Is it really because he holds a grudge? Is that it?<br /><br />Soderbergh has used many interesting and innovative techniques in his films before, playing with narrative and visuals. Color blocked film noir, color coding scenes to keep us grounded in shifting timelines and listening to out of sync conversations are ideas Soderbergh has explored before to greater success. He uses some of these ideas here again, but doesn't really take them anywhere new. When he shows George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez staring at each other over a glass of wine as we hear their earlier conversation, it brings a heightened intensity to their words. This is one of the many things that made \\"Out of Sight\\" so interesting. In \\"Traffic\\", he gave each storyline a sort of color identity, allowing us to instantly immerse ourselves back into the sprawling narrative every time we revisit a character. He used both of these techniques in earlier works, as though auditioning them. In \\"Haywire\\", he seems to be moving backwards. Instead of trying something new in a smaller film, he is recycling ideas used in his bigger, more accomplished films and reusing them in this smaller film to lesser effect.<br /><br />The Dublin sequence is involving, exciting and a really well choreographed action scene. The fight in the diner is also interesting and seems especially brutal. The problem is that everything in between seems like we have seen them a hundred ifnot a million times before. And everything in between just seems boring. So, we have two well done, interesting sequences sandwiched among a multitude of boring, lengthy passages. And these boring bits drag the entire film down and make it seem longer than its 90 minutes of running time. A lot longer. And it is never a good thing to leave an action film feeling as though the film was longer than it actually is.<br /><br />Soderbergh's next film is \\"Magic Mike\\", from a screenplay by Channing Tatum about his life as a male stripper before he became an actor. It stars Tatum, Matt Bomer (TV's \\"White Collar\\"), Alex Pettyfer (\\"I Am Number 4\\", \\"Beastly\\") and Joe Manganiello (HBO's \\"True Blood\\") as fellow strippers. Yeah. Another Oscar contender, I'm sure. Then, his HBO biopic of Liberace starring Michael Douglas and Matt Damon. Hopefully, Soderbergh will then be back on track and create something to rival \\"Out of Sight\\", \\"Erin Brockovich\\" or \\"Traffic\\".eems to shock even him.

B0071T5PN0|3.0|I don't know what it is , but this new CD is difficult to listen to.<br /><br />I don't know if it is because it is OVER-COMPRESSED (like too many CD's today) and thus there are no natural dynamics and everything is being MUSHED together .......<br /><br />-or-<br /><br />they mixed it with David Lee Roth's vocals WAY TOO LOUD<br /><br />But it is hard to really hear and appreciate the songs because the music sounds so muffled and distant, while Roth's vocals are drowning everything else out.<br /><br />It almost sounds like a LIVE recording or even a Karaoke track with somebody singing over top a backing track.<br /><br />I simply have a hard time listening to it and really hearing what it going on.<br /><br />Very strange.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Liam Neeson's new film \\"The Grey\\". Not because of Liam Neeson; he has developed into quite an action star over the last few years, bringing an undeniable, believable intensity to silly, over-the-top genre films. I was surprised because the film was co-written and directed by Joe Carnahan, the writer and director of \\"Smokin' Aces\\" and \\"The A-Team\\", two of my least favorite films ever.<br /><br />Neeson has transformed himself from respected independent film actor and dramatic leading man to a viable action star, appearing in the improbably silly Luc Besson film \\"Taken\\", made more palatable and interesting by his completely serious and believable performance. It was also a hit, so he followed that with \\"Unknown\\", another film made so much better by his commanding persona. Another hit. Now, we have \\"The Grey\\", proving he can \\"open\\" an action film, making him more bankable in Hollywood power circles.<br /><br />Ottway (Neeson) is a guard at an oil drilling facility in the farthest reaches of the Alaskan tundra. The men who work here do dangerous work for high pay and seem to spend their off-time drinking to help them forget where they are. Ottway accompanies the men when they leave the base and uses his high power rifle to keep them safe from hunting wolves. The men seem to live for their R & R back in civilization and rowdily crowd onto the plane eager for the trip to Anchorage. Shortly after the plane takes off, it runs into turbulence and crashes. Ottway and a handful of survivors band together and attempt to get back to civilization. But they soon realize they have to deal with more than just the elements; the plane crash landed in the middle of a pack of wolves. And they're hungry.<br /><br />The survivors include Talget (Dermot Mulroney), Hendrick (Dallas Roberts, TV's \\"The Good Wife\\", and \\"3:10 to Yuma\\"), Diaz (Frank Grillo, \\"Warrior\\", TV's \\"The Gates\\"), Burke (Nonso Anozie, \\"Conan the Barbarian\\"), Flannery (Joe Anderson, TV's \\"The River\\"), Hernandez (Ben Bray) and Lewenden (James Badge Dale, \\"Shame\\", \\"The Departed\\"). Each of these men has different backgrounds, strengths and problems all of which will lead to complications for the group and provide challenges to one and all.<br /><br />Carnahan spends a significant amount of time establishing Ottway's character, allowing us to watch him in the strange environment of this oil drilling station. We watch as he does his job, scanning the horizon for wolves near the workers, protecting the humans from the wild beasts. Later we watch as he deals with the loneliness, the isolation of this outpost. We spend some time listening to his thoughts. We watch some brief snippets of dreams and remembrances back to time he spent with his wife. This helps to establish why it is so important for him to make it back to civilization, why it is so important for him to survive. These moments are very effective and help us get into Ottway's mind and become a part of his journey.<br /><br />But as great as these are, the other characters are not established as well. Throughout the journey, as the men make their way across the snow and ice, they share remembrances, stories and dreams, giving us a brief insight into their lives. We learn a little about them, enough I guess, given the significance of these characters, but the level of detail pales in comparison to Neeson. I can't help but wonder what someone like Michael Mann might have done. Every character in \\"Heat\\" has some back-story.<br /><br />As the rowdy men crowd onto the plane, anxious for some R & R, we watch the technicians trying to deice the wings and get the aircraft moving. During the flight, we get our first individual glimpses of most of the characters and start to learn about them. But because there are so many of them, it is difficult to set them apart.<br /><br />As soon as the plane begins to experience trouble, you know you are in for something different. It just looks and feels different,more authentic, and more intense. And the moment of the plane crash is particularly harrowing. You really feel as though you are in the plane with the men. I doubt this is a selling point for most, but it helps to make the film feel authentic. It also happens fast. In most films, plane crashes seem to happen in slow motion, allowing us to revel in every special effect and filmmaking trick the director has in his arsenal.<br /><br />Because of this early moment, the intensity of it, Carnahan has a lot to live up to and thankfully, there are other moments which will in all likelihood bring you to the edge of your seat.<br /><br />The journey is punctuated by harrowing moments when the men have to overcome an obstacle; traversing a gorge on a single rope, fighting off wolves, dealing with the elements. Naturally, as soon as someone comes up with the idea of traversing a gorge on a single rope, someone will have a fear of heights. This fear leads to problems. The real journey comes in how these disparate men overcome these obstacles. And because each of the men is different, they will react differently to these tests.<br /><br />Carnahan doesn't shy away from depicting the harshness of the conditions or the environment. It's a bleak place and I can't imagine I would survive for 10 minutes. It looks uncomfortable and I can't imagine the actors were in the lap of luxury during the shoot.<br /><br />\\"The Grey\\" is a surprisingly effective action film. Neeson's intensity adds a lot to the film, but Carnahan's attention to detail also help to paint a picture of survival you really feel you are a part of until the bitter end.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I am helping generate any business for the film or not.more authentic, and more intense.

B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a fun little game, those type of games that you start playing with the idea of 'one quick game' and before you know it, 30 minutes are gone. The concept of the game is fairly easy, you stack things in a grocery bag. However, once you start playing, you notice that there's more than one way to do things, and figuring those ways out, plus the fact that things don't always react how you would expect, is what keeps the game interesting. As you go along, you unlock more modes, thus giving you more ways to play and less chance of getting bored. Overall, a fun game that I know I'll definitely be back to play a lot more.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its pretty good. I mean you have to play it a lot to unlock another game which takes awhile but its still good.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|We just watched the DVD and I have to say this is the closest thing to being at the live performance! The only thing I wish was that I had a bigger TV. The sound is incredible with the Dolby 5.1. The cinematography allows you to see so many detailed aspects that you don't get to see while sitting in the audience. I do have to admit though that it is probably better to see the live performance before you see the DVD production. I have seen the production 8 times and the video just brings me back to when I was sitting in the live theater. I would highly recommend getting this for anyone that is a Phantom of the Opera fan!  Also as an added bonus Sarah Brightman sings at the end along with 4 other Phantoms!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love all the different types of games. It is fun to keep earning points to buy other games. My boys and I have fun competing against each other. We are always trying to earn more points to purchase more games.
B006DHAT5K|5.0|I loved this movie! I could have done without seeing Joel McHale's naked butt. Why does Hollywood think nudity is so funny and original?  Other than that I really enjoyed this movie and had some great laughs.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i think it shoud let every one that has a kindle fire have this app y wont it let me
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is tricky for me as I am not great at them.  It has clues to hep you get through but I am slow at it.  The graphics are lovely to look at and it is stretching my skills at exploring the different spaces.  I am enjoying it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I just bought this game and I am already addicted to it, it is so cute and yet the puzzles are not thar easy Irs basically a tetris with groceries just like they said.  I love it :):) and it really plays and looks good on the kindle fire.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|A ton of fun!!! Start to play and you just cant stop. Its kinda similar to angry birds but with groceries.

B003QSOFFO|2.0|I hope those who buy this for their children also explain the truth about who Pocahontas really was:  - That her real name was Matoaka (the name Pocahontas was only a nickname meaning \\"spoiled child\\")  - That she was not a woman but a little girl no older than 11 years old  - That John Smith decimated her people and she accused him of being a liar (Smith conveniently claimed, after her death and 17 years after the fact, that she \\"rescued\\" him no less than 3 times)  - That she was forced to marry John Rolfe, a tobacco farmer, as a condition of her release after being kidnapped and taken to England and then renamed \\"Rebecca\\" (We can thank John for today's cigarette epidemic)  - That she died in England at 21 or 22 years old and never saw her own people again  And furthermore:  - That Disney refused the help of the modern day Powhatans, of which Pocahontas was a member, for cultural and historical accuracy  - That Disney created and perpetuated this myth in the name of \\"entertainment\\" at the expense of others (the Powhatans)  Not quite the \\"magic\\" Disney portrays, is it?!  Watch the movie for the mythical entertainment that it is, but it's important, for children especially, to also know the truth.
B00081U7HC|5.0|This will always be Julia Robert's best film. She looks extremely beautiful but also very natural. The songs are fun and beautiful. These songs come at the exact right time and really help support the story. I became a fan of Julia after this film.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It was a wonderful surprise to find these books. In the great tradition of sci-fi they explore life in an alternate reality, in this case a post-apocalyptic world where a community of people shelter in a silo from the toxic wasteland outside. Any discussion of the outside is illegal, punishable by being sent outside to clean the lenses that provide the silo's inhabitants a view of the world around them, and to inevitable death. But is the wool being pulled over their eyes?  The first book is a classic short story, taking up only 7% of the omnibus but leaving you begging for more. As the omnibus proceeds, we get deeper and deeper into the truth about life in the silo.  Buy the omnibus. You'll love it!

0525478817|5.0|At first I read it up until Hazel didn't like V for Vendetta, because who doesn't like V for Vendetta??? It's a classic movie that is so not a dude film.  It took me a couple of days to get over that, but I read the rest in a night and... oh my god, I was a wreck. Thank you, John Green, for all the feels.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I like how the game advances. Very nice way to progress the game. You did a very nice job. Great great great.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|For Stargate fans, of which I am one, this is a must-have for your DVD collection.  It would probably not be of interest to anyone who hasn't watched the entire series.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I dont know Tina Fey at all and dont really care who she is. I saw few of the movies that she is in but is not a person that I pay attention to but after reading this book, I get to know her and what she does for living. It was a good book and very entertaining. Funny and yet insightful of her own life. Looking forward to her future performance.
0062059882|4.0|During the early chapters, I was a little bored by all the descriptions of who was drinking what sort of tea and even further descriptions by the tea coming out later.  However, the book does have Neil Gaiman's trademark wit, and it does (eventually) build up to a very satisfying conclusion.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|more challenging than I guessed. Worth the download. some of the games are easy and simple but most are fun to play.
0307593312|3.0|A few years ago, I was told that I should read Haruki Murakami's books. And I started with one that was on sale at my local shop -- 'Kafka on the Shore'. I was completely blown away by Murakami's work. Since then, I've read a number of his books -- 'Norwegian Wood', 'The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle', Sputnik Sweetheart', 'Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World', and his latest work, which has been called his magnum opus, '1Q84'.<br /><br />The story takes place in the year 1984 and centers on two characters in their thirties. On one side, we have Aomame, a solitary woman with a lonely past who works as a fitness instructor and occasional assassin of men who abuse their wives or girlfriends. On the other, we have Tengo, a solitary man with a lonely past who teaches math three days a week at a cram school and works on his writing in his spare time. At the start of the book, Tengo is reviewing literary submissions for a new writer award and he stumbles upon a fantastic story called 'Air Chrysalis 'by a seventeen-year-old girl named Fuka-Eri. He tries to convince his editor, Komatsu, to move it to the top of the pile but while Komatsu likes the story, he doesn't like the writing style. He comes up with a plan for Tengo to rewrite Fuka-Eri's novel in secret and Tengo reluctantly agrees after he meets the strange young girl himself. Meanwhile, Aomame is discovering that there are strange events in the world, such as newsworthy events she has no memory of and two moons in the sky. She says she believes she's in a new world, which she christens 1Q84, the Q standing for a question (in Japanese, this is also a play on the pronunciation, since the Japanese word for nine has the same pronunciation as the letter Q). Aomame is asked by the elderly woman she commits assassinations for to kill the leader of a religious organization called Sakigake, the same organization which the mysterious Fuka-Eri's parents had once been affiliated with.<br />I'm going to stop right there with the recap. Suffice to say, the stories of Aomame and Tengo are closely connected. The book alternates chapters between the two of them, until book three when a third character, Ushikawa, is added into the mix. Although some criticized Murakami use of third-person narration (he typically uses first-person), I actually enjoyed that aspect of it. Aomame and Tengo are both two great characters and I really loved their stories.<br /><br />However, by book three the story really starts to drag. Not a whole lot seems to happen in that section, and I get the feeling that Murakami was just spinning his wheels and trying to pad out the end. The prime example of this is with the character of Ushikawa. When he's first introduced, it's obvious he's a creepy guy who's not to be trusted. But when Ushikawa becomes one of the major characters in book three, this point is relentlessly hammered into our heads. Every chapter that centers on Ushikawa repeats that he's ugly and unlikable, as if we've forgotten about it since the last time it was mentioned two chapters earlier. While he has some important contributions to the story, we did not need so much of a focus on this guy and Murakami could have excised a lot of useless material from these chapters.<br /><br />And that's really the major weakness of the book, what stops it from being truly great. The story just overstays its welcome in book three.<br /><br />That's not to say there's not a lot of good. Even a not-great Murakami novel is better than the best work of lesser authors. But be prepared for some monotony towards the end.uffice to say, the stories of Aomame and Tengo are closely connected.

B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great game that's definitely worth the price.  I can't stop playing.  The levels get more and more challenging.  Download it now you will not be disappointed.
B005X7HAAS|5.0|This movie isn't for everyone.  It's an art film, not an action blowout, but the action is there, it just builds tension and so when it comes it has more impact.  If you're a fan of Takeshi Kitano's \\"Brother\\" you're going to love \\"Outrage\\".
B006PHD0RW|4.0|the game is designed very well and functions well on EVO 4G. the graphics are simple yet look great. the game can become time consuming and is entertaining for the first couple of hours. great game for the FAoTD.
B0067QPVD2|5.0|I LOVE John Carpenter's The Thing... so when I heard there was a prequel/remake... I was up in arms.  Of course I bought my movie ticket on day one, just like the others in the theater, and boy was I pleasantly surprised.  What's even better was going home and popping in JC's The Thing and seeing how they set continuity between the two films.  A great old school style horror film with new school style tricks.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I was like many others a little cautious about getting this app because of some of the bad reviews, but I'm glad I finally did.  It does most of what I normally need from LinkedIn and as others have mentioned is a great/quick way of doing a search for an existing or new contact.<br /><br />The only feature on my wish list is a mobile version of LinkedIn/Signal which is a very quick and easy way of viewing and filtering updates done by your network contacts.  I use this every day online because it a great way of interacting with your existing network.<br /><br />I'm still giving this app 5 stars becasue I think this is an excellent effort to provide mobile LinkedIn and becasue of how useful it is on my Kindle Fire.  Keep up the good work!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|If you're a fan of this filmmaker, chances are you've seen Bronson, and recognize the amount of style this filmmaker can mass into his movies.  It's an art film, not the action blockbuster that the trailer makes it out to be, so don't be upset when you realize what kind of movie it is.  Regardless, this is textbook suspense and tension, my heart was racing during many of the scenes, Albert Brooks performance was grand, Ron Perlman on key, and Brian Cranston excellent as well.  Great score, great style, you'll be haunted by the character of Driver long after the credits roll.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I have downloaded several hidden object/adventure games to my Kindle Fire, some for $.99, some for $4.99.  This is BY FAR the best game and the best deal at $1.99. Hours of enjoyment. The game makes you think. I loved having to puzzle out how to use the found objects. I don't like to use hints unless absolutely necessary...only checked once, in the beginning: turns out I missed one important item. In these games, you have to check out everything in every scene. Took me 3 days, off and on, to complete it.  Like others, I'm always disappointed when an engaging and fun game ends, and I wish there was more, but it lasted longer than any other game I've purchased, including those that cost more. Can't wait for another Fire Maple Game for my Kindle Fire.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|This album rocks!!! All the songs flow together, fit together, and are rockin', funky, grooving, and on fire! By far the best Van Halen record in my book. The songs are great too, but who really cares when the vibe is there and never let's up. Whenever talking Van Halen or just great music in general with most anyone it's Fair Warning that always comes up as one of their best moments. This record is hard rock at it's best! There's something magical about all the first 5 Van Halen records mostly tonally and in the overall vibe area that didn't translate to the 1984 album, which is still a good record but doesn't have that organic vibe and feel the first 5 did, and Fair Warning is at the top of the pile.  It's always baffled me when people say \\"Heavy Metal\\" when referring to Van Halen... There's nothing ominous and overtly dark or menacing about any of their music. Even Fair Warning which some say is a dark album... if you put this record on at a party folks are gonna be getting down, grooving, and dancing around. There's not gonna be any head-banging or sitting in the corner with heads hanging low! There is gonna be some Head-Bobbin' goin on though!  As far as \\"Hair-Band\\"... are these people really serious? You gotta be kidding me?? Van Halen (with David Lee Roth ONLY) is in the same school as Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones. There not in league with Warrant, Bon Jovi, or Poison!  Anyway... Fair Warning is a great record and a musical masterpiece! My personal favorites are \\"Dirty Movies\\" and \\"Mean Street\\" dirty, nasty, funky, and rockin' like no other! \\"Pictures on the silver screen, greatest thing you've ever seen'\\"!!!

B005G4TJUC|4.0|I love this movie. There was some excellent action and a blood pumping score! The actors weren't to bad either. Shia does a great job as Sam. Rosie Huntington Whitely is hot and charming. The Voice actors deserve Oscars! Peter Cullen is amazing as Prime! Lenard Nimoy is excellent as Sentinel (The bastard). And all others voice actors did excellent! Dark of the moon is a fun action movie but serious at the time and it works! It one problem was the ending and the story. THe ending was rushed and the story was weak and has holes here and there. Other than those 2 things a great addition to the action movie genre and the transformers universe.
B006H3MJ7G|5.0|This Cd had me dancing and singing the whole time, it's so beautiful! I love track number 9 rock the pants, it was a real killer at my last family gathering we had a blast! Fun CD very entertaining and prince Royce is amazing!

0374275637|5.0|Of the structure of the book:<br /><br />1. There are 32 pages of references (out of 481 pages of text) which are written in an easy-to-follow format.<br /><br />2. Each chapter is about 11 pages, each organized around a single concept. The book can't be read out of order, but no single chapter is overpowering. And each discrete concept can be singled out for re-reading (the third quarter of the book is more difficult reading and may need to be reread).<br /><br />3. There's a great and thorough index.<br /><br />4. There are two great full length articles by Kahneman and Twersky at the end as two separate appendices. A: \\"Judgement Under Uncertainty; Heuristics and Biases\\"; B: \\"Choices, Values and Frames.\\"<br /><br />Thoughts on the content:<br /><br />1. This book could be read in addition to [[ASIN:1400063515 The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable]] and [[ASIN:1400067936 Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets]] as he manages to cover many of the same points (especially around p. 240) with dramatically less ego than Taleb. He also warms up ideas that are presented in [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]] (Malcolm Gladwell). It also touched on some topics covered in [[ASIN:0385530609 Sway: The Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behavior]]<br /><br />2. Some parts of the chapter on \\"Associative Machine\\" feel a bit.....strained. (He talks about feeling that one needs soap for a stained soul).<br /><br />3. Kahnemann goes over logical errors that we have all heard of time and time again (Availability Bias, Illusion of Understanding, etc.), but he manages to give them a coherent theoretical framework (System 1 and System 2) that has not been done in any of the books that I have read up until this point.<br /><br />4. There are lots of questions that I might have seen addressed. In particular, I would like to know the likelihood of committing each of these logical fallacies as a function of IQ. Also, if there is any type of training that could help to reduce the frequency of these errors. There was no discussion or suggestion of any such thing. (Could it have been better training in Statistics? Logic? Epistemology?) Or, can these things not be improved?<br /><br />5. The author talked about international comparisons toward the end of the book. But in point of fact, these would have been good to have throughout the book. How do these things vary between, say, Frenchmen and Chinese?<br /><br />6. The reading gets tough in the 3rd section-- particularly at the chapter on \\"Bernoulli's Errors.\\" I could have done with a few sample problems to test the understanding of the concepts. What he worked up to in the 3rd section was: People don't weight the probability of events in decision making based on their probability of occurring reality. Was that really that novel? Was that something that we didn't know?<br /><br />7. There was a titanic amount of information in this book (or at least it felt that way). So, there was some repetition/ recapitulation. Said repetition was not bothersome, because that much information needs to be iterated from time to time.<br /><br />8. p. 218 was probably the best part of the book. Kahnemann really nailed it when he quantitatively studied the failure of predictions of experts.<br /><br />9. The \\"Regression to the Mean\\" chapter was probably the toughest one in part 2. I might like to have known some things about regression to the mean over different timescales. So, China did very well for several centuries, but then didn't do well at all during the Qing Dynasty. And these cycles went on for hundreds of years. So, how does regression to the mean apply to populations and nations? Where are the limits of its applicability?<br /><br />10. The chapter on \\"Thinking About Life\\" was great. I have heard it said that your chance of staying together with someone is the same whether you date them for years or if you marry them after a short time.This chapter doesn't deal with a study of that, but it comes very close.<br /><br />In sum: This book was worth the new purchase price (hardcover) and the time that it took to reread it and the time that it will take to *re-read* it to work through some of the tougher examples.that it took to reread it and the time that it will take to *re-read* it to work through some of the tougher examples.
B005D51II0|5.0|If you don't have an extensive classical music collection, and consider classical more a part of many styles you like rather than your only musical passion, should you buy a 50-CD set?<br />Yes, wholeheartedly.<br />I am still discovering the many beautiful performances included in the set, yet have only been impressed by everything I have discovered so far. Discovery is really the magic word here. Many of these albums are not the classics you know, like Beethoven's fifth. They are often lesser known to the casual classical fan, and take you to places you didn't expect to be taken. For example, Manuel de Falla's The Cornered hat, the first CD of the collection (each one is numbered on the back), absolutely ravished me with its freshness, bouncing originality, and Spanish rytms. [Side note: I also learned that this one album alone is a prized, out-of-print CD in its single (non set) issue, which makes this 50-CD set, which includes many such rare performances, all the more exciting.] Saint-Saens Piano Concerto 2, 4 and 5 is a masterpiece of relaxing piano and orchestra piece I listened to all day in repeat mode with great pleasure while working on a project at home. Ravel's CD includes the famous Bolero, but also wonderful lesser known pieces that again amazed me with their originality. I realize now that I really didn't know classical music that well at all. And I haven't mentioned the outstanding technical quality, for recordings made way before the digital era. Wonderfull bass and full sound. I feel like a little kid and can't wait to discover more CDs... There is no doubt you are buying at a very affordable price years of musical pleasure when you purchase this Decca set.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This is a classic movie based on true historical life story of King George the 6th.

B000002VMD|5.0|The word \\"legend\\" is the most over-used word in the English language. However, once in a great, great while, the word really fits.  Whitney Houston and Karen Carpenter were two superb singers that richly deserve every inch of that word.  They will now be together in heaven.

B006ZDU7QI|5.0|\\"Making Mirrors,\\" is a breath of fresh air for the intense musical lover.  Influences abound to create a different style/sound for each track.  Despite the differences; each track carefully flows into the other with smoothness and ease.  Gotye is a master of addicting hooks and melodies.  \\"Making Mirrors,\\" is a tidal wave of resonanting sounds.  I feel completely immersed while listening to each track.  There is no way to, \\"box,\\" this album, so don't try.  It's genius all on it's own.  I can't stop listening to it.  I've had it on repeat, non stop since I bought it.  I couldn't be more pleased!  I just bought tickets to see him on April 2nd, and will be purchasing, \\"Like Drawing Blood,\\" next!
B004UXUX4Q|1.0|I didn't like this film and I think I might possibly have hated it. Strong sentiment but consider this; predictable plot, two-dimensional, unlikable, stereotypical characters and a pace that moves slower than a trans-Pacific journey in an outrigger canoe.  OK,the Hawaiian scenery was beautiful and the acting was OK. Just OK. But the entire time I couldn't stop looking at my watch and found myself looking forward to the trip my wife had planned for us after the movie to Bed, Bath and Beyond. And I hate Bed, Bath and Beyond.  This was a pointless piece of film-making centered around George Clooney's character who I neither cared for nor believe exits in the real world. And that includes Hawaii. C'mon, the comic relief character for this maudlin exercise in tropical bleakness practically steals every scene he's in!  The only really interesting character the film possesses is the dead wife and she had the good sense to exit stage-left (figuratively speaking) before the opening credits were over. Maybe the film-makers realized that and that's why they kept her around in a coma until the end. I empathized with the Robert Forester character when he said that they were \\"putting lipstick on a corpse\\". Best line in the film and an apt analogy for the whole thing.

B006PHD0RW|2.0|This game has great potential, but it is very frustrating to play because the controls are SO nonresponsive. If they fix that, I will change my rating to 5*s. Until then I just can't enjoy tapping the screen over and over, hoping that it will respond. htc rezound.

B006HGXGWU|2.0|The movie had a cool storyline; however, it trudged along very slowly.  I didn't know which way the movie was going...Was it a story about schizophrenia, or were the man's visions a telling of what is to come?  Hmmmm...<br /><br />Just when things were finally realized, the movie ended, and this left the audience wondering what will happen to the family.<br /><br />Just a little bit more of the story would have been good.<br /><br />Overall, while it's an interesting story, the movie did seem a bit slow.
0143119680|5.0|Currently still reading this book but have to fight to put it down and get on with my everyday life! Deborah Harkness has created a story that pulls you in and keeps you there in \\"A Discovery of Witches\\". The historical details and intelligence of her characters breathes life and believability of being part of our modern world. I'm already looking forward to her second book in the All Souls Trilogy this summer!

0425221806|5.0|Watchers is a typical Koontz novel; it manages to blend a psychological thriller with moments of humor and tenderness. The reader finishes with a fairly positive outlook, as often happens in Koontz's books.  This storyline will appeal to anyone who grew up with pets - or even stuffed animals - and ever wished they'd been able to talk to them. Koontz manages to realize every adults childhood dream and even brings a level of humanism to the main antagonist. You can't help but cheer for the main characters as they are entangled in a web of almost supernatural happenings, all to bring an end to an experiment gone horribly wrong... Supporting characters and secondary storylines not only expand the primary storyline, but bring all the events together in the end.  Koontz's character development is, as always, fantastic.

0307120007|2.0|It may be a classic but it has two major downfalls.  The binding is a plastic spiral and it stinks.  Why would anyone spiral bind a young kid's book, especially one they are supposed to handle?  It is flimsy and easy to rip out pages.  My kids have not completely destroyed it yet, but I know of children who have ripped this book to shreds.  My copy does have a lot of tape on the binding, not an easy fix with the spiral binding.  And it STINKS! When reading I always skip the smell the flowers page because I can't stand the smell.  I can't really describe it, not like flowers, like cheap scented lotion maybe.  And we have had this book for over 2 years and it still smells.  Sure it has some nice interactions but so do plenty of other books.  My advice would be to check out Usborne's series of \\"It's not my...\\" dinosaur, train, doll.  They are board books with lots of great textures and surfaces.  The only thing Pat the Bunny has that other books (that I have found) don't have is a mirror.  My one year old does like to look at himself.  My first son could have cared less about this book.  My one year old is really into it at the moment.  Besides the mirror he likes to say bye bye to Paul and Judy on the last page.

0553381695|4.0|I have enjoyed this series immensely, and am desperately awaiting the coming of the paperback 5th book. I was introduced by a Grandson at Christmas, who gave me the first book of this series.  It is a little hard to keep juggling all the characters in your head while waiting him to tell us more of what is happening in their life, but I like it more than if he was trying to keep them all together and comment on their activities.

B0007KTAU4|4.0|I've known Carla Bruni for some time now. I had heard that she sang her own music. I didn't know she was that good, that pleasant to listen. The music is very nice and the words are meaningful. Bravo Mme. Bruni-Sarkosy, vous avez le don de faire des belles choses pour l'esprit.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I listen to everything. All genres, all time periods. If it's good, I like it. This album by Adele is an instant classic.  It is simply mesmerizing and if her emotion doesn't take you to a different place when you listen to her I'm not sure whatever will. Powerful lyrics sung with a level of hunger and passion that I've rarely heard from any artist before.  Adele's version of the Cure's Lovesong is remarkable. And I loved the original.  I'm not a reviewer that goes through and gives a take on each song, though I do appreciate the time and thoughts of those reviewers. Rather I look at a work of art as a whole.  So this is it... If you truly enjoy beautiful music with a heartfelt story sung flawlessly then just buy this CD. Trust me. Do not cheat yourself by just downloading Rolling and Someone, get it all.  You will listen to the whole album over and over, I promise. It's that good.

B0039RDWOW|5.0|Forest Gump said \\"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you will get.\\" but, what if we could avoid the stupid flavors, ones that make our mouths pucker, or those bitter super-dark treats you despise?  Atul Gawande draws the reader into the E.R., dealing with a life threatening emergency, that could have been avoided, if someone had used the proper checklist.  The loss of blood, the surgeons fears and chaos that ensued, all because one detail was missed (The job of the Checklist).  Atul writing style is easy to follow, and very enjoyable, you want to savor, each of his accounts, where a \\"checklist\\" could have prevented gross errors or, could save more lives.    One of the books accounts, deals with arrogance, human and company error.  It was Boeing with their newest, state-of-the-art plane, crashing down hard, in front of the high military brass.  This almost caused Boeing to go bankrupt!  This disaster brought together, agroup of scientist, who refused to throw the plane away.  With their brilliant minds, checklist, and data gathering, it was proved the B-17 was a worthy plane (one million miles without incident).  The reader should be able to take away, truths, that will create more order in their life.  \\"Checklist\\" will find you reviewing things in your life, you never thought much of.  Waiting the extra second, when the red light, turns green?  Avoid a car wreck!  The book was a sinful delight!
B003VANOFY|1.0|I've gone through two of these headsets now, and both have broken in the same manner.  A small, plastic plate is screwed over the base of the left earpiece.  It holds the \\"joint\\" of the earpiece to the frame that goes on your head.  This plate is easily broken just from sitting the headphones on your desk.  The plate cracks and snaps off the screws, leaving the joint open to fall out, making the headset practically useless.  I've rigged mine with tape, but it is unreliable.  I won't be buying another one.
B001U7B4T8|1.0|I am not one to complain, but the VHS version of this Concert is much better than the DVD. Hopefully somewhere along the way someone will take the initiative to re-master and re-release a more acceptable DVD version of this Epic Event.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Game was playing nicely until i got to the summer well scene. I have the golden snake and the rope but the game says 'that wont work here'. I went ahead and checked the journal and i have done all of the steps. I cant go any furthef until this bug is fixed or somebody points out that I missed something! Otherwise this game would get 5 stars! I'm on a GalaxyTab running gingerbread if that helps the dev :-)
B006UG90RM|3.0|Still waiting for some real classic VH.  The good thing is that someone directed Eddie away from that experimental sound from VH III and the greatest hit albums.  Yes, we hear he dug into the vaults from the past but if it helped him get back in touch with VH reality then good for him.  I do miss Michael Anthonys back vocals maybe Eddie should rethink his relationship with him.  Not to return to play bass because I think he loves playing with his son.  It might be what keeps him alive and focused.  But MA vocals are missed to truely get that original sound please fix somehow.  I think even MA deep down understands that EVH wants to play with his son.  Over all a good album from begining to end but I'm looking forward to hopefully another album ASAP.
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|Seriously, I liked it.<br /><br />But that's to say that I like Michael Mann. Not sure if the current crop of movie critics are even old enough to remember him or his quiet adrenaline-fueled films. Pretty surprising to see a whopping 93% tomato rating - screams limited background and experience.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Director Nicolas Refn is pretty much directing straight off the Mann playbook; from shot sequence, set-up/framing, timing, choice of actor/acting style, and the all-important electro-synth soundtrack. Even the opening sequence Mistral font is a throwback to the late 80s-mid 90s when Mann was at the his peak of creativity.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling does a pretty good James Caan in 'Thief', and I appreciate that Carey Mulligan stands on her own skill alone, nice. This is my first film with Ms. Mulligan and I have to say that I was impressed with her performance, she's better than Ashley Judd in the same role via 'Heat'.<br /><br />Overall, not sure how I feel about this flick - other than, sure, I liked the film. But it definitely takes a knock down from straight nickel five-pointers because Mann is still alive.<br /><br />Hom&agrave;ge or ripoff? Unclear. I'm hoping it's the former and that Refn will take the praise he gained from this production and move onto his own turf; find and express own vision.<br /><br />I'll put this down as four-stars with the caveat that if you like Mann - then you'll love this intense flick. And if you've never experienced '[[ASIN:0792838947 Thief]]', '[[ASIN:B0017HRJ04 Heat]]' or '[[ASIN:B0000509C1 Manhunter]]' - I strongly urge you to do so.

B006OT03BM|4.0|I love this set, I recieved it a few days ago and couldn't have been happier to get it. I ordered it from MovieMars, and they did a great job on timely shipping. The set is everything I could ask for, plus it was way bigger than expected. The only thong that upsets me is the part with the film and bays sig. The plastic case the film is in is very scratched, and for a brand new item it shouldn't be. I paid good money, and I wanted a perfect product, which I did not get.

B000006MS3|4.0|Well THIS is certainly different, haha.  Kate Bush's popularity online is well-deserving I suppose.  Lyrically \\"Pull Out the Pin\\" is about the subject of war and, I believe specifically, the Vietnam War.  While the vocal melody reminds me of any number of early 80's artists (and David Bowie's \\"Criminal World\\" in particular) the Asian vibes are really catchy and experimental.  Most CERTAINLY a memorable song.  I especially like the delicate Pat Benatar-like way she sings the line \\"And my silver bullet, my silver bullet\\".  Oh and the way she screams \\"I LOVE LIFE!\\" is another highlight.  The instrumental portion of the song near the end is wonderful.  \\"Night of the Swallow\\" has a strangely put together vocal melody thanks to the way the song is sort of divided between two different parts.  Essentially it's just another similar-sounding 80's track but Kate's vocals are really amazing and some of the arrangements are nice.  Whatever it is that resembles bagpipes throughout the track is pretty cool.  The melody is pretty generic though- repeated listens further prove this.  \\"Get Out of My House\\" is some kind of twisted dance song.  Not a particular favorite of mine but not one that I'd dismiss either.  One moment that really bugs me (actually it happens twice) is when the male spoken section mutters the line \\"My home, my joy, I'm barred and bolted and I won't let you in\\".  I actually think this particular aspect was influenced by the krautrock band, Can and especially their Ege Bamyasi album where similar vocal mannerisms were used in abundance there.  The final two minutes are unnecessary since there's nothing resembling music taking place- just a messy assortment of dance beats and weird, screaming vocals.  I believe I can make out what sounds like \\"Heeee haw!!\\"  \\"Houdini\\" is overdone in the vocal melody.  No need for such a theatrical exaggeration on the part of Kate's vocal range because the vocal melody suffers as a result.  \\"Sat In Your Lap\\" has one of the strangestchoruses I've experienced in a while.  It's deceivingly upbeat... I guess.  The title song takes tribal beats, an unusual singing style from Kate, and creates an entirely new never before heard experiment!  Don't expect to like THIS right away, haha.  Kate Bush definitely wasn't afraid to be daring back in day which is definitely commendable.  Maybe if I HAD to complain about one little thing, 5 minutes of this stuff is sort of overbearing, but I believe I'll make the necessary adjustments and accept Kate's daring attempt at diversity here over time.  \\"Suspended In Gaffa\\" has an upbeat vocal melody that takes almost no effort to actually get into on the part of the listener, which is a bonus because let's be honest, this isn't exactly the easiest album in the world to comprehend.  I got into this track right away.  I can do without the occasional chant-screaming though.  Kate has a good voice but not enough for me to tolerate *that*.  \\"All the Love\\" sings a ballad here.  Not bad but it's sort of distracting the way the melody suddenly stops and a quiet half-spoken chorus comes in, and the obvious chorus is really terrible because it just keeps repeating the same line somewhat mindlessly \\"All the love, all the love, all the love!\\".  Overall, I recommend the Dreaming.  What an album!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I like this game more than I thought I would. It looked like child's game at first. After reading several good reviews I gave it a try. Its as fun as angry birds. If you like that game you will like this one.
B000007MVL|4.0|A letdown compared to the Kick Inside.  A pretty big letdown in fact but not enough to reflect the overall rating.  \\"Hammer Horror\\" is a pretty cool song.  It almost reminds me of a female version of Roxy Music but instead of Brian Ferry, it's Kate Bush!  I'm definitely thinking of the song \\"The Thrill of It All\\" especially in the chorus \\"Hammer horror hammer horror, won't leave me alone, the first time in my life, I leave the lights on\\".  The verse melody is a little contrived, but it's alright.  \\"Kashka From Baghdad\\" features Maria Muldaur-style balladry.  It's nice Valentine's Day romance music I suppose but nothing particularly noteworthy.  The chorus is especially oddly constructed.  \\"At night, they're seen, laughing, etc\\".  It's sung in a demanding, but not very spectacular way.  \\"Wow\\" sounds ahead of its time by a couple years.  It's in the way the verse melody is sung.  I can't recall another female singer who sounded like THIS in 1979.  Not sure what to think of the chorus which consists of nothing but \\"wow, wow, wow, I'm coming home\\".  It is sort of hypnotizing the way she sings \\"Oh yeah you're amazing, we think you're incredible, you say we're fantastic, but still we don't head the bill\\".  It's a pretty cool song anyway so don't think for one second that I'm bashing it.  I still admire the uniqueness of Kate's voice and enjoy the song overall.  \\"In Search of Peter Pan\\" has a melancholy tone that's pretty appealing with great vocals to make it even more enticing.  The chorus is the most noticeable aspect since it reminds me of children playing in their room without a care in the world.  This means the song is really unique the way it combines different emotions.  \\"In the Warm Room\\" is a peaceful written Carole King-type piano ballad with subtle theatrical vibes.  I'm not really fond of the vocal melody.  The problem is that Kate sings it normally with no desire to make it stand out.  On the Kick Inside, she sung more creatively and really took advantage ofher range.  Now it's reserved.  \\"Coffee Homeground\\" is a nice attempt to elevate her vocal range with a bouncy, carnival-like verse melody but it's not *quite* as effective as the same antics she better showcased on the previous album where they were more unusual and mysterious.  \\"Symphony In Blue\\" is perhaps an indication that the rest of the album wouldn't be able to match up to most of the material from the Kick Inside.  While nicely sung, it's not adventurous or creative enough.  The strength of the Kick Inside is that Kate's voice is absolutely outrageous and well... not so much in this case.  Overall, a really pleasant album but Kate's debut will probably always remain my number one favorite album she never made.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when I first got this app, I thought it would be a pain to use my desktop through my Kindle Fire, but it was very easy to use. There are lots of gestures to move around windows, zoom in, and ways to execute ctrl+alt+del and many other keyboard shortcuts. It's also great that I don't have to be on the same network to connect to my computer.
B000006U44|5.0|WOW!  What was I thinking waiting all these years to finally hear a Kate Bush album?  I've read many reviews that raved about this album and it was even recommended to me by friends but... I ignored everybody.  I ignored all the musicians who've been naming Kate Bush as an influential figure and a well-respected songwriter.  For some reason I was under the assumption Kate Bush was like a British version of Patti Smith and her music focused around punk rock/old fashioned rock with a new twist.  Well... maybe a slight comparison is possible between the two artists (though I totally don't hear it if there actually *is* a similarity).  Kate's more about a distinctive vocal shrieking, theatrical elements, odd jumpy vocal ranges and melodies, and even resembling Samantha Sang's voice quite a bit (remember her)?  All I know is that the Kick Inside is CERTAINLY a 5-star album.  This is the kind of album I can see myself playing several, hundreds of times over the course of my lifespan.<br /><br />\\"Moving\\" is my introduction to Kate Bush.  Keep in mind that, before tonight I've never heard *anything* by Kate Bush.  Nothing at all.  This is all brand new to me!  Anyway \\"Moving\\" has a beautiful vocal melody but... it's not beautiful in the traditional sense.  It's beautiful because it's original.  Kate Bush has a radically different type of singing style.  No it's not like Patti Smith, Pat Benatar, Deborah Harry or ANYBODY else.  Her voice on this track is striking to me for how stunningly soothing it is with a hint of atmospheric mystery.  \\"The Saxophone Song\\" doesn't focus around saxophones (thank goodness) but the sax that appears in the background probably doesn't belong there because it's occasionally overbearing.  The vocals sort of remind me of Annie Haslam, but it's not really intentional.  It's not a ripoff either.  It's just a slight resemblance in the way both Kate and Annie sing.<br /><br />\\"Strange Phenomena\\" contains eerie operatic vocals and wonderful piano work.  This type of piano work is highly original because bands like Nightwish would go on to use them frequently, along with several other symphonic metal bands.  The chorus is uplifting and just lovely.  The atmosphere is deceiving because there's really no telling whether this should be considered beauty or oddness.  It's a mixture of both, perhaps the reason Kate Bush has such a unique and mysterious personality.  \\"Kite\\" is some kind of freak out, reggae-style pop song.  I dunno, but I've never heard anything like this.  Where did Kate Bush come from?  Haha.  This is really cool stuff!  \\"The Man With the Child In His Eyes\\" is a dreamy ballad with clever verse melodies (clever because Kate takes her vocal range all over the place making the replay value go through the roof).<br /><br />\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is pretty good, but I definitely prefer the Pat Benatar version.  I know, there's a little debate going on concerning which version is better but the reason I prefer the Benatar version is because her range just feels perfectly pleasant and natural whereas Kate's version is a little awkward vocally, and just strange.  I still like it of course.  In time I can almost guarantee I'll appreciate it more.  Some of the background arrangements are abnormal.  \\"James and the Cold Gun\\" sounds like it influenced the 80's band Quarterflash thanks to the aggressive all-out rocking nature of the guitar and rhythm work.  \\"Feel It\\" is sort of straight forward in comparison to the rest of the material here because Kate's vocals are calm and ballad-like.  Once again, the piano works amazingly well.  In fact the piano really fits Kate's style throughout the entire album really showcasing that unusual theatrical style she seems to be going for here.<br /><br />\\"On to Be In Love\\" almost sounds theatrical but, of course, with a twist.  The twist being Kate Bush has an original style so it's not sung or performed in a normal way.  I love the vocal melody.  \\"L'Amour Looks Something Like You\\" is fairly straight forward and fairly forgettable believe it or not.  Yikes!  A song that's sort of underwhelming!  Say it ain't so, haha.  The laidback lounge style doesn't work for me but I still enjoy it.  It's only a couple minutes long anyway.  \\"Them Heavy People\\" contains bouncy reggae beats and Kate's unique vocal talents elevate the melody (and the entire song for that matter) dramatically.  \\"Room For the Life\\" features an odd similarity to a Jethro Tull vocal melody and Jethro's particular style of piano playing, I totally kid you not.  Kate's range is *ridiculously* good here.  The title song ends the album on a haunting note with inspiring balladry material that's not normal by ANY stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />Overall, wow.  I'm speechless.  The Kick Inside lives up to the hype and *then* some!
B001HQZJP2|5.0|Great funny and full of adventure,and gripping all in one film, great for the whole family.enjoyable!  A good Friday night movie for all, highly recommend for all
B00000DQSS|3.0|Nothing can compete with the Kick Inside.  However Never For Ever is slightly worse than Lionheart which is more of a blow.  \\"Breathing\\" is overlong by a couple minutes and totally soaked in that familiar 80's production that a good chunk of the artists (most artists) were unfortunately forced to persevere.  This song has a pretty good vocal melody regardless of the production and I like the way the chorus sort of pulsates as Kate sings the words \\"breath for me\\".  It's a pretty cool effect.  This is sort of like \\"Wuthering Heights\\" in the delicate vocal department.  The jazzy bass guitar during the second half is pretty run of the mill by this point because so many artists utilized a similar guitar sound (oh who am I kidding? *identical* guitar sound) in the same way back in the 80's.  I don't hate it at all though.  \\"The Wedding List\\" has a slightly \\"uppity\\" verse melody and a majestic/atmospheric (and bland) chorus.  Nice change of pace there. The way Kate sings \\"I'll put him on the wedding list\\" reminds me of Cher's voice for some reason.  Just slightly.  This same bouncy type of vocal melody was arguably better when used on Kate's previous album, but... well, I'm lowering my expectations here since so far *nothing* compares to the brilliance that is the Kick Inside.  \\"Egypt\\" has a fair vocal melody but it's really short and undeveloped-sounding.  The synths are really cool and remind me of Jan Hammer.  The second half of the song is all about some weird silent build-up of screaming.  It provides tension for the listener but it's nothing mind-blowing or anything.  \\"All We Ever Look For\\" is too hoity toity for my tastes.  I can honestly say I hate this vocal melody.  I didn't think Kate would ever write something so terrible but here it is.  \\"Blow Away (For Bill)\\" is another disappointment.  It's a tender written ballad and... eh, *too* tender, haha.  I barely detect a melody which makes matters worse.  \\"Babooshka\\" has interesting arrangements and a memorable vocal melody.  I wish the rest of the album followed suit.  I actually like the delicate way Kate sings the verse line and uses subtle measures to make the melody almost bouncy.  \\"Violin\\" has an upbeat new wave vibe kicking in full gear.  Kate's vocals are wonderful here.  NOW we're talking!  I wish everything on this album was like \\"Babooshka\\", \\"Violin\\" and \\"Breathing\\".  The three best songs by far.  Overall, \\"All We Ever Look For\\" and \\"Blow Away (For Bill)\\" is the reason I'm not really that fond of this album overall.  Skip both of these tracks and the rest is quite the rewarding experience.
B0001I55NS|4.0|This is an interesting and intriguing movie with history, sci fi, romance, action and excitement.  It is colorful and well-acted.  The time-travel theme into medival France and return was exciting.  I enjoyed watching the trebuchets attacking the fort at night with balls of fire.  It is worth seeing more than once.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing you have so many different games to choose frommy personal favorite is the one were you are a bat and you collect the candies
B006ISJQ1W|4.0|I only bought this because I have everything Johnny Depp has made since he was 17. I am a true and loyal fan. However, I heard the movie was awful but bought it anyway because I added it to my collection. It was drawn out and boring and sad at the same time. It is still Johnny and I bought it against advice from others. I also couldn't stand Fear and Loathing so I should have realized that this would not be the different. The reason I couldn't stand Fear and Loathing was I didn't like seeing Johnny so ugly in the makeup. I do love the Pirates movies because he is still charming in a sick way. I can't wait for Johnny's new movies he is making. He is such a talented actor in my opinion.
0553801473|1.0|It seems to me ADWD is a book that was created to extend what was originally 5 book series to 7 book series. I felt like nothing really happens until very late part of the book. Very disapointed...
B006PHD0RW|5.0|One of the best free app of the day games that has been offered.  This game has excellent presentation.  It has several different ways to play (puzzle, rampage, standard).  And it offers achievement medals for completing levels in a certain way.  Easily worth the dollar.
1595826971|5.0|I was quite impressed with the quality of this book. It is 9x12.5 inches so it's a nice size and a good deal on Amazon. It's also full of inspiring art in various stages from concept to finish. I thoroughly enjoy it and recommend it.

B005URRCUY|5.0|As always, the Black Keys never fails to disappoint. Even the physical album itself is commendably creative. Dan and Patrick are original musical geniuses and I hope they keep making these albums!
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|\\"Real Steel\\" may be derivative, but it's nice to see a feel-good film. I've read a few of the Amazon reviews, but chose to keep an open mind and discover the world created by director Shawn Levy, a film that was generally accepted by the critics. I remember the Richard Matheson story that was presented on the Twilight Zone TV episode, though it really takes it's own identity. I enjoyed Hugh Jackman, and his turnaround character as the dad, and young Dakota wasn't as annoying (to me) as some others thought. Evangeline Lilly was sweet and tough, as necessary, and was an endearing medium.<br /><br />The film's only Oscar nom is for Visual Effects, which were totally believable, but I think it's Harry Potter's year to win.<br /><br />I like the underdog, feel-good films a lot. There's a lot of nastiness and mean-spirited stuff that, to me, needs to be countered with \\"fluff\\" like this. And it's not really fluff, and it's not just for kids. Some of the emotions presented may not be entirely understood by most kids, except for the bullying.<br /><br />One thing I especially liked was the fact that the custody battle was handled with intelligence and genuine concern, and the kid's own issues really mattered. Hope Davis was quite fine, as the kid's aunt, a performance layered with kindness as well as suspicion. Kindness wins.<br /><br />That can't be a bad thing.<br /><br />Another film on a similar theme is \\"Win Win\\"; no special effects, but another film about a lost kid who someone actually cares for. No one's seen that film. Everyone should.

B0066W1AZK|4.0|This is a good app, but leaves one wishing for a little more.  I particularly like the ability to change the computer's skill level to suit your own. I'd like to see the pieces that have been captured and a running total of games played with wins, losses and draws (against the computer); that would be nice.

B006C45MRE|4.0|****Minor spoilers:  I do warn you before I give them****  The idea of old west meets advanced alien life forms is a refreshing change of pace. Don't watch this film expecting an intellectual story (IE like Independence Day).  It's just an entertaining \\"what if\\" sort of film and it is very well done.  May I add: \\"Mr. Ford, you've still got it after all these years!\\"  One scene was an obvious nod to Indiana Jones (you'll know it when you see it, film watchers).  This film would have gotten a 5 star rating from me, but there were a few things that really bothered me. ****minor spoilers below****  Emma is a glaring example of a \\"plot device!\\"  Yes, it made for an interesting twist but after her campfire debut, she goes back to well... ordinary.  I'd have liked to see her prove herself to be more extraordinary. (Sorry, I know this is vague, but I am trying not to give away too much).  I know this film is supposed to make you feel like you're watching an old western with a twist, but making the Native Americans hooting, hollering \\"kill the white man before you know if he is after your common enemy\\" type people is just irritating.  I don't expect a love fest between the cowboys and the Native people, but I wish the writers would have toned down the war-crying!  At least they didn't make the chief blame evil spirits. Instead he blames an earth bound, more plausible enemy - the gold hungry settlers.  One of the last aliens we see die does meet an end that is rather fitting. Poetic Justice! Yes, I cheered.  Cowboys and Aliens does deliver something else many will appreciate:  very little foul language and NO explicit sexual scenes. Yes, there is one flashback of Jake and his (wife?) having a tumble in the grass, but they are fully clothed.  The only other scene is a brief glimpse of Emma nude, but you only see her from behind. These are  two things I definitely appreciated.  The film is a little gory though it is mainly green alien blood and there is the occasional violencebefitting a western.  This is a decent family film if you have older children that don't scare easily.  I think younger viewers might have issues with it, but as with any film pre-screening never hurts.

B00003CXA6|3.0|Yes, silly, terrible beards... very slow, plodding battle scenes (nothing about the real battle of Gettysburg was slow or plodding), but it's an OK movie overall.  Some great moments, some great shots, but it could be as long as it is and be much, much more exciting.  I think Sheen is miscast, much too small and soft-spoken to be Lee, Costumes are crappy, but great scale and after seeing \\"Gods And Generals... well, this movie doesn't seem as bad.  I first saw it in a special pre-release preview in 1991 and at the time gave it a C-... It's a solid C now.  Has aged pretty well over time, but still a definitive, \\"great\\" movie on Gettysburg hasn't been made yet.

B0026MOVO6|4.0|Whitney Houston's sad passing in February 2012, following more than a decade of personal downfall, had left a considerable body of work, although she was not as prolific as she might have been. This had one big reason; the 1992 soundtrack \\"The Bodyguard\\", which sold well over 20 million copies; before that, she released three regular albums, of which the last, \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\", was rather weak. After \\"The Bodyguard\\", two more soundtracks of the artist's starring movies followed. However, fans had to wait until late 1998 for her next proper longplayer. It was worth the wait.  With modern r&b, rap, neo-soul and hip-hop raging around at the end of the millennium, Houston left nothing to the chance and summoned a legion of trendy producers beginning with Rodney Jerkins, Missy Elliott and Wyclef Jean and ending with adult contemporary stalwarts Diane Warren and Babyface. Especially the whopping title track penned by Wyclef Jean entered the anals of sleek, immaculately produced pop-music, as did the US-high-charting \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" featuring Kelly Price and Faith Evans.  The record also includes the Oscar winning duet with rival Mariah Carey (\\"When You Believe\\" from \\"The Prince of Egypt\\") and Rodney Jerkins' helmed \\"If I Told You That\\", later redone as a duet with George Michael. Even the then-much-hyped Lauryn Hill was enlisted for the last moment, producing the closer \\"I Was Made To Love Him\\". Here, as well as on Missy Elliott's \\"In My Business\\", lyrics were hintng at the singer's unending love for husband Bobby Brown, although the reality of her life was just at the time of this release starting to enter darkness of drugs, alcohol and domestic abuse.  In the final analysis, \\"My Love Is Your Love\\" not only can be called the last great album of Whitney Houston in terms of vocal performance. It may eventually be ackowledged as her best - certainly her most consistent - regular album ever.
0307474259|5.0|I used to be very smug about how healthy I thought my low-fat eating habits were.  Then I got a physical and discovered my lipid counts were horrendous.  My first assumption was that it must be hereditary, since my eating habits were so good.  The doctor told me to cut down on foods I hardly eat in the first place (eggs and red meat), so I felt like I needed a different answer.  I browsed books on Diet and Nutrition that were well-reviewed when I found these books by Taubes.  From the reader feedback, it sounded like \\"Atkins\\" to me, and since I always thought he was an irresponsible quack, I was highly skeptical.  But I couldn't ignore all of the positive feedback, so I started reading.  It wasn't long before I felt completely duped by everything I thought I knew.  Taubes lays out his heresies in such a well-documented, logical manner, I found it impossible not to be convinced.  I was converted from a fat-counter to a carb-counter.  I started eating more eggs and meat, not less, and did my best to cut out as many refined carbs as I could, giving up bread, rice, pasta, potatoes, and switching to low sugar versions of foods I couldn't give up (eg oatmeal).  After just 4 weeks, my lipid counts showed amazing improvement.  My cholesterol was down 40 points, my triglycerides were cut by more than half, and my HDL actually went up.  I won't go so far as to take everything in this book as gospel; eg I can't justify any recommendation of processed meats, but in terms of the overall theory espoused in this book, I'm a complete believer, and I've got the numbers to prove it.

B005LAIIS0|1.0|There are plenty of reviews and info on what this movie is about but what they do not tell is that there is no ending to this movie.<br /><br />The Grey was a decent although not a great movie right up until the ending. At which point everyone in the theater groaned and complained about the ending. Us included. In fact a few of the theater patrons did more than groan, they were quite upset with the ending.<br /><br />If you want to see a movie with good or satisfying or complete ending, then you might as well skip this movie. I read the reviews but missed the fact that this movie leaves the ending up to you, ie. it has no ending. I'm really upset that we wasted the time and money to see this movie. You go to the movies expecting entertainment, a good story and a good or at least complete ending. This movie does not have an ending, what it has is that you are supposed to decide what happens. I really dislike movies like that. I write and would never leave my readers hanging there with no real ending.<br />However, if can accept that you will have to decide the final ending then you will probably like this movie. If on the other hand, you are like me and expect the writer to finish the story, then you will definitely not like this movie.

B0064NTZQ2|2.0|This movie is a film school graduate's mishmash of 1980s noirish film styles and attitudes. This throwback offers jagged titles, electronic music, and stylized, Michael Mann-like direction. The carefully lit, composed shots of Gosling looking sullen and tough is an obvious homage to James Dean. What's missing is originality, a unique vision, real drama, and the desire to be anything more than a good-looking, magazine cover-worthy movie. This is a hipster's idea of cool - derivative, shamelessly nostalgic, an appeal for edginess within the safe and familiar, and an infatuation with designer clothing. We all know, from Gosling's first appearance, that he's a handsome bad boy who will be doomed by falling in love, and everything in-between is just a lot of filler violence until that happens. Gosling is also miscast - to make this pretty boy seem tougher than he is, he dons a fright mask and refuses to say more than a few words (like a hipster in a bad neighborhood). The only thing I'd use this movie for is to collect freeze frame shots of Gosling's gorgeous face and hang them up on a wall. It's also a boon to makers of shiny satin jackets with dragons on the backs of them (Shopaholics start your engines). But if you're expecting something more than a fashion photo spread dressed up as a movie, look elsewhere.

076781214X|2.0|About the only thing I get from this movie is that Peggy Sue and Charlie were meant to be. And nothing Peggy Sue did could alter that. Not even going back 25 years into the past to break up with him.  Which would have been fine, if Peggy Sue had ever realized that if she broke up with Charlie, her kids would have never been born. But she doesn't. Instead all she thinks about is that now she can have some fun, but she misses her kids and wants to go back to her own time.  The film tries to show Michael as an intense, sensitive poet. Instead he comes across as someone who is going insane and will probably die of drug overdose or automobile accident by age 23.  Everyone else in the movie is extremely shallow. As has been noted before, the woman in the wheelchair is never explained. Charlie gives up on his music career even before he graduates from High School. Even Peggy's Grandparents are portrayed as flaky weirdos, attending strange clubs and participating in bizarre rituals.  Was there any point in Peggy Sue going back to 1960? Did she manage to change anything? Did Peggy learn anything to better help her deal with her life? Not really. So what was the point, other than to waste 103 minutes?

0307394549|5.0|I'll admit it, I was a little embarrassed to admit I was buying a Martha Stewart, well, ANYTHING.  BUT...this book is amazing.  Truly amazing.  There's a fabulous visual breakdown of the cookies in the front of the book, they are sorted into texture-based categories, and the recipes themselves are appealing, straightforward, and every single thing I've made from this book is delicious.  My single complaint is that the book automatically assumes that you have a countertop mixer.  I WISH I had a countertop mixer but alas!  However, mixing other ways works just fine and the quality of the finished products are delicious crowd pleasers.  I'm totally picking up more Martha Stewart cookbooks asap.
0307716511|5.0|This book was not only a great engaging story to read .. I found most appealing the use of words ... the choices  in the description of emotions and feelings...it was a book that I found myself wishing I had a high lighter  handy so that I might highlight all the provoking quotes ...(it was from the library so that was not an option) ..How it feels to loose someone you love ..how we process it and how it changes us forever ..and the effect a loss has on the others that we love and hold so dear and our interaction with them  .........\\"emotions were bitten back\\" so simple yet so thoroughly real.

B0053YGYO4|4.0|After the great Viva la Vida album, I really looked forward to this new release. I'll agree with some of the others that it was not as grand a record as I had hoped it to be. The style is certainly different as Coldplay seems to experiment a little in some areas. However, this is still a really good album in my opinion and all Coldplay fans will (or should) enjoy it! The short instrumentals before certain tracks help keep the album flowing well.
0439023513|3.0|I loved the first 2 books. Probably 2 of the best written, thrilling and original novels I've ever read. But, when I finished reading the last book (last night, at 5am), I felt like many other people who wrote negative reviews felt: disappointed, drained, outraged, and I just wanted to throw away it and delete it from my Kindle.  It's uncommon to read a trilogy that don't try to please the reader in any way, but instead, take all the characters whom you learnt to love and whom you identify with, and destroy them from the very core of their essence. Make important characters die of stupid, extremely violent and useless deaths. Build up a love story, and then completely forget it, and the characters involved forget about it as well.  But, if the message was: the war is cruel and completely crushes all the human beings in some way involved, I got the message loud and clear, louder and clearer possibly of any other book I've ever read. For sure the Mockingjay is more about the message than about the story, which is in some way annoying and pedantic, but at the same time, hating the book seams part of the message itself: you hate this book, because you hate the war. I don't like when the war is glorified, and it's no glorified, for sure, in this disturbing, unnerving novel.  If the book had evolved and ended in a different way, I would have probably felt satisfied at the moment, but, who knows, I would have probably forgotten it very quickly, as you forget the majority of the book you read. It's not the case with the Hunger Games trilogy. I will never, ever read it again, because when I read a story, I really need a sparkle of hope to remain always lighted, and I'm not sure if I will watch the movie either, but The Hunger Games will be very, very hard to forget.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This album was amazing! Not only is the music great, but pay attention to the lyrics too. The lyrics in the songs have a lot of meaning and positive themes. The album flows easily and is short enough to listen to in one setting. If you don't like it on the first listen, please listen to it again and again. You will enjoy it more as you listen to it more. I recommend this album not to just Coldplay fans but fans of great music in general!

0440241901|3.0|I love Sophie Kinsella - \\"The Undomesticated Goddess\\", \\"Remember Me?\\", & \\"Twenties Girl\\" are my all time favorites! The are hilarious and heartwarming. Yet, I wasn't impressed nor in love with this book. If this is your first Sophie Kinsella book, don't write her off as an author, read some of her other books before you rush to any decisions. The story line had sooooo much potential, but it was wasted on a character I just couldn't make myself like. It was a boring and tedious plot, far to predicable, and I ended up feeling sorry more for Conner than anyone else, really. , and I don't think Jack was all that impressive either. The characters in this story seemed flat and stoic. I must also say that I don't like The Shopaholic novels ... I tried to like them, but wasn't impressed, and was, frankly, bored by the story line that wouldn't end (The film version was better ... I know, gasp ... that rarely happens to me!).

B003UESJHO|5.0|Having been a longtime fan of Christian Bale ever since I saw Newsies when I was 9 or 10, this movie was on my to-see list for a long time.  The only reason why it took me until 2012 to watch it is because I normally dislike sports themed movies (boxing, wrestling, football, etc.)  I can say that this movie is not about the sport.  Boxing takes a back seat here.  This is about family and a really gritty but great beat-the-odds story.  My boyfriend enjoyed it, I'm sure, because of the punching.  I was surprised that I also enjoyed it.  I consider Christian Bale one of the best actors alive today.  I don't give a crap about the Brad Pitts, George Clooney, or any of those flat actors.  Think about it- when has Brad Pitt not played himself in every role?  Same with Clooney.  Christian Bale is multi-dimensional and that's why it is NEVER boring to watch him.  Think Gary Oldman- you can never recognize this guy in any of his roles until you see his name credited.  He is that much of a chameleon.  The only reason why Bale isn't on par with Oldman is because Bale is too handsome so he's easily recognizable.  His character seemed greasy and skittish and all throughout the movie I kept wondering why he was overdoing the movements but then we got a glimpse of the REAL Dicky Eklund at the end credits.  Bale hit that character spot on.  He moved and talked just like the real Dicky.  Just when you think he finally slipped up and \\"overacted\\" it turns out he was just entirely immersed into his character.  This guy is full of surprises.  From start to finish the movie is entertaining.  Only thing I didn't like was the typical captioned ending they always show for films based on true stories.  It would be nice to have seen that played out on screen.  Perhaps using the real Micky and Dicky as older versions of Mark and Christian.  Otherwise, a very enjoyable movie.
B006UG90RM|5.0|The more I listen to this album the more it brings back memories of Van Halen's glory days. Eddie is at his finest, Alex is at is finest, Dave has lost a little of the top end but it is still Dave, Wolfgang does an ample job for Anthony. I like ever song on this album and not ashamed to say I thourougly enjoy \\"Tattoo\\". My favorite's are \\"Big River\\" and \\"Blood and Fire\\". It should make it to #1 on the charts.

0143119680|4.0|This book had all the makings of a 5 star book.  It was well written and had interesting characters that I cared about.  However, 1/3 into the book it turned into a paranormal romance (for about 100 pages).  I am not a paranormal romance fan so I found the character's behaviors off-putting.  The main character was fawning all over her new lover and her behavior didn't seem in character.  Thankfully, the book seemed to regain its initial direction.  I am eager to see where the characters go next.

B006UG90RM|5.0|I got this cd and was floored.  I must admit it took about 4 listens to dig this album entirely.  I am glad these guys are back and I hope they take the charts by storm.  I am tired of all these all-sound-alike rock bands of today, the dancing buffoon music and the lip-sync crap.  The Guitar King has returned!  People criticize DLR singing, but its not about his vocal range its about his attitude and quirkiness...  I find Stay Frosty absolutely funny.. and thats the point, DLR is always laughing at stuff he says...  I am a big Sammy Hagar fan and if it weren't for him I would have never discovered VH.  5150 was my greatest cd in highschool but as a fan I also went to see what VH had done in the past, and I must say, DLR with VH was very entertaining and was probably better than Van Hagar.  So I think this album is great and love the classic VH sound, hope to see them in concert!
B006DHAT5K|4.0|What's Your Number is a fun and frothy romantic comedy starring one of my favorite actresses, Anna Farris. I've loved her in everything since Scary Movie. Here she shines as always, and Chris Evans is very hot. Chris has many scenes that ooze sexiness. He's shirtless often, and in a couple of scenes he's in just his underwear. And in a couple of scenes, he's completely nude. Of course, they don't show anything. But it's still sexy, nonetheless. What's Your Number is worth seeing!

1594202842|4.0|Mothers are known for their unconditional love, universally. I didn't know that it could be Chinese or American. Yet, I loved this book and heart wrenching honesty of an American woman who falsely identifies and prides herself to be Chinese!  Oppression is the Political position of China. Naturally it must penetrate in the living culture of people. While America is built on principals of Freedom and every human or living being at core wants to be free. But freedom can be abused and is abused in the US. That's why Amy worries for her daughters, wasting their time, becoming idle. She is a high achiever, goal oriented person and she expects the same from her children through the same Chinese mold she was product of, but it doesn't always work. however, I was hoping to find if she had some how come to know or found a way to achieve excellence not by force but through inspiration, motivation, encouragement, but alas she gives in....  I felt for Amy, the Tiger mother, as much as I felt for her daughters. Since I am from India and raised two children here, I know that it's a struggle when you are raised in one culture and raising children in other. We can't carve out a groove for our children and shelter them from mainstream. I was a mother in early 1970s when America was going through its moral war: campuses were filled with hippies, open sex or wife swapping marriages, bra burning on women's issues, I was petrified. But I was bent on raising children on one powerful mother's tool: LOVE! I wanted my children to do whatever they liked but know right from wrong. I couldn't expect them to be in waters of Western world and not touch by it. It surprises me that Amy, having born in this country, having achieved highest education in top most university, working at prestigious university, married to a Jewish person, speaking, writing fluent English, calls herself Chinese! Get real!  All mothers wish best for their children. But, Amy shows a tremendous courage, persistence exercising what she expects and believe is right. I loved the way she showed her dissatisfaction of a greeting card on her birthday. It made her daughters feel bad but it perhaps taught them lesson that one should show some care at least on special occasions! My mother said anything to me till I was fifty years of age, it was okay in that culture but I can't do that to my children. They have American sensitivity, political correctness and if I want to be here and raise them here, the rules are different. That lesson finally Amy learns hard way and through her younger daughter.  What's the bottom line in a given life? Amy saw through her sister's battle of cancer that life is too short, too fragile. Then should one at any cost strive to excel? For what? Because one is Chinese? or can be achieved only the Chinese way? That individual happiness doesn't count? How should we measure life? Should we measure life only through accomplishments, excellence, success, fame and money? Once again there is no spirituality in this debate to know happiness.  Also, it's very cruel for Amy to say that western adult children throw their parents in Nursing homes. I feel these types of comments are ruthless, thoughtless. I have been in this country for over 42 years and seen many, many take care of their parents at homes or move them in their neighborhoods. Americans value their freedom, even when they are old. They prefer to stay at home alone as long as they can. American culture, life style and challenges are different, its not India or China where domestic help is available. Amy is being too harsh on Westerners and not recognizing that western mothers also have produced great achievers, to mention a few like president Obama, Steve Jobbs, Bill Gates and list will be longer than the Chinese achievers.  Amy, like it or not but at the end we all become Americans and you should be proud of that because your accomplishments may you call it Chinese but they belong to America!  This book was a great read, took me back to memory lane taking an account, knowing I too had a chance to achieve what she achieved for her daughters, but I didn't have the courage, stamina or even perhaps a desire because definition of excellence differs. Bravo, Amy Chua, I would say it in Chinese if I knew it!

B001GQ2BNQ|5.0|LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!  I've swam off and on for fitness my whole life, but as I've gotten older I have found that I can't turn my head enough to get a decent inhale and I tend to get water in my nose.  Because of some neck pain I also tend to keep my head up a little.  This snorkel is amazing. I had read a review stating that water got into the snorkel (possibly due to loose squeeze on the mouth piece). I kept this in mind for the first use and decided to just practice by putting head in the water and breathing. Within a few minutes I was comfortable and began my laps.  For the first time in a long time I was able to do the length of the pool without feeling like I was struggling to breathe. Another review I read stated that using the snorkel helped improve swimming stroke/form and I totally agree.  I used it as recommended on the website -that is to warm up with it, then without, the warm down with it.  I noticed that I had much better form after using the snorkel.  My husband is like me with regard to our swimming for fitness and after he tried my snorkel he came home that night and ordered one for himself. In his words...\\"this is good stuff!\\"  He is able to inhale through his mouth/snorkel and exhale through his nose, but when I tried it, I sucked in a lot of water -I just couldn't get the rhythm of it.  I did fine with inhaling and exhaling via my mouth/snorkel so that's how I'm gonna continue.  My only concern is that if the mouth piece breaks or wears out, the company does not seem to offer a replacement piece, which means replacing the whole thing.  Hopefully, it will last a while.  Keep in mind that my husband and I are your average Joes and it works GREAT for us. I don't know how it will work for better swimmers that do flip turns. The instructions and website give tips for more advanced swimmers.

B005MYEPXC|4.0|It took me 2 viewings to appreciate this film and I think most of the negative comments about it are from people who have little or no knowledge of the city's historic artistic past (Gertrude Stein, Fitzgerald, Hemingway)since literature was an important part of the city's cultural past. Owen Wilson, whether you like him or not, is a natural for Woody's muse plus the beautiful photography of this city will enchant you. So I would recommend it to die hard Allen fans and lovers of this remarkable city--all others stay away!!  I just might pick this one up in Blu-ray.

B006UG90RM|4.0|I bought this CD after reading the rave reviews on here and not wanting to wait to hear the songs from another source. VH hasn't sounded much like early VH in quite some time. The albums with Sammy were much less impressive for me. With that in mind, this album seems to take on a harder sound that draws closer to their earlier work, but still retains some of the Sammmy-era melodies. In other words, it's a bit in-between music-wise but none of the songs really reached out and grabbed me (except for \\"Beats Workin'\\" which sounds an awful lot like \\"Walk All Over You\\" by AC/DC). As for DLR's vocals, they aren't entirely comparable to his 70s abilities but still stand up in their own right. Bottom line: if you liked \\"Me Wise Magic\\" you'll probably like this album.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is very good but could use some sound affects added to it besides that it is well worth it.
B002BWP49C|2.0|What \\"Breaking Dawn\\" adds up to is a watered-down version of a godawful book.  It doesn't have the audacity to be as godawful as the book.  It doesn't do much of anything.  It's just \\"meh\\".<br /><br />The wedding scene drags out interminably, to the point where you wished they had climbed out the window and eloped.  The South American scenery is beautiful but the honeymoon scenes don't come close to being interesting.  About the only thing remotely interesting is Bella's nightmarish pregnancy; her post-delivery transformation is a big yawn.<br /><br />Characters... what characters?  After planning the wedding, perky little Alice has nothing to do the rest of the movie.  Emmett's and Jasper's parts have shrunk to the point that if weren't in the film nobody would miss them.  I liked Seth in the book but he's not developed enough in the movie.  And Leah, who was a feisty character in \\"Eclipse\\", is just plain pathetic in this movie.  Rosalie is semi-convincing as doting auntie, and Taylor Lautner gives a pretty good performance as Jacob, although his imprinting on a newborn had me retching.  Actually, Kristen Stewart gives the best performance in the film; we can almost feel her pain as whatever is growing inside her is eating her up from the inside out.  Billy Burke gives his usual understated, standout performance as Bella's dad.  And Robert Pattinson, as usual in this series, just looks gorgeous without making much effort at acting.<br /><br />The movie tries to improve on the book in spots and fails abysmally.  There's an unintentionally hilarious scene where all the wolves have a big pow-wow in dubbed English.  One almost wishes they would bark and howl with subtitles translating what they were howling about but that might have been even funnier.  And the big transformation scene, which is the linchpin of the book, looks like a poor imitation of some scenes out of \\"Fantastic Voyage\\".  But since the book had Bella lying like an inert lump and never twitching an eyelash while she was being burned alive internally, I guess all the movie could do was show her lying like an inert lump.  It just isn't very interesting to watch.<br /><br />So what we have to wait for in Part 2 is Bella being a very well-bred newborn, Jacob imprinting further on Renesmee, and the climactic battle scene with the Volturi in which everybody stands around yacking and then turn around and go home.  I'll pass.<br /><br />Judy Lindd alive internally, I guess all the movie could do was show her lying like an inert lump.  It just isn't very interesting to watch.

1439153663|3.0|I began this novel so excited because the setting and characters were so intriguing.  Unfortunately, as the story progressed, the main character just got more and more stupid and the story became more like a romance novel (boy and girl love each other but a misunderstanding makes them lose each other).  The setting could have been awesome but was ignored much of the time.  The ending was absolutely horrible -- not remotely satisfying for me.  And I really didn't appreciate the author giving away the ending in the prologue!!  But three stars because the book did hold my attention and was rather entertaining most of the time.

B006OAB3ME|5.0|I was, with great anticipation, looking forward to Macca's live performance on last week's Grammy's to see if in fact he would perform something from this new release and, if that were the case, be accompanied by Krall's band. His rendition -, that's a solid yes on both accounts, of \\"My Valentine\\", dedicated to his new bride, Nancy Shevell, was solid and I can't seem to get this melody out of my head since. Paul, if you're reading this, I suggest you get on the hopper and release this particular track as a single. The album itself is a throwback to material that he was growing up with and leaned upon by his longtime partner in crime, John Lennon, for some Beatles tracks. Macca tones down his vocals - just adding the right smooth touch throughout. And it doesn't hurt that he is backed by the impeccable sounding Diana Krall & her cohorts. These so-called \\"standards\\", aside from McCartney's 2 original tracks, will grow on you with repeated listens. Without additional fanfare, might I lend my encouragement to him releasing more of the same in the future...

B002EAKWEI|5.0|Between 1984 and 1994, ITV screened a series of 41 adaptations of Conan-Doyle's masterwork. The series was adapted for telly by John Hawkesworth and directed by a variety of Granada worthies and is considered by many to be the best adaptation (film or TV) aired so far. Let's be clear, there are some very considerable liberties taken with ACD's original storylines but the overall Holmesian \\"feel\\" of the series is so strong that these liberties are barely noticeable. This is no revisionist adaptation, it isn't \\"[[ASIN:B003TO5414 updated]]\\", \\"improved\\" or [[ASIN:B003YCOIG8 dumbed-down]]: like a stick of seaside rock, it has Conan Doyle written all the way through.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it did rather slip under my radar; while I'm no Holmes maniac, I do love the stories but to watch such a long running series required more persistence, enthusiasm and, yes, VCR capacity, than I could ever muster. So, to find the lot packaged so neatly (sixteen discs!) is a true godsend. I shan't be watching much else for some months to come, I suspect.<br /><br />Just as the adaptation is applauded for its faithfulness, so is Jeremy Brett considered to be the best Holmes ever presented and he plays the part with huge authority. The stories have, of course, a strong \\"Boys Own\\" flavour to them and Brett clearly understood that a degree of overacting was required to set the tone. His ham is finely sliced and, like the best Parma ham, he melts in the mouth. Ascetic, ascerbic, ironic and sarcastic, his mercurial performance is literally a joy to watch and I defy anyone to watch the series and then read a Holmes story without visualising Holmes as Brett. David Burke and (later) Edward Hardwicke do Watson to a tee; always a step behind (literally and mentally) his good friend Holmes (although for my money, I think Hardwicke does it best). Let's not forget Rosalie Williams' doughty Mrs. Hudson - always there to remove a sopping cloak and bowler and deliver a hearty breakfast (curried fowl and some piping hot coffee) after a night's adventuring. The cast includes a number of regulars - Colin Jeavons is seminal as the terrier-like Lestrade, and Charles Gray stately as Holmes' brother Mycroft. Some considerable fun can be extracted by spotting familiar faces in the line up of minor characters and I was delighted to see Tom Watt (Eastenders' Lofty Holloway) in the opening episode. Of course, plenty of bigger names pass by (Robert Hardy, John Thaw, Joss Ackland and the like) and I suspect that an appearance in the series was a not inconsiderable feather in the cap of even the most successful thesp. Admittedly, the acting can be variable in places (even Burke is a little stiff and scripty at times) but that only adds to the charm.<br /><br />Production quality is... well, it's a typical 1980's ITV costume drama. The extras are sparser on the ground than they should be - they're well kitted out but their costumes are a little too fresh and their performances a tad too derivative to be utterly convincing, but hey! you can't have everything. The series made excellent use of locations (outside the full scale Baker Street set and no. 221b interior) and larger props - one can almost smell the oily, smoky stink of the steam-engine as Holmes and Watson rush to the countryside to solve yet another rural murder or abduction mystery.<br /><br />The only down-side is that the series never succeeded in its aim of adapting all sixty of Conan-Doyle's stories - Brett died of a heart attack before Hawkesworth's vision could be realised. 41 out of 60 will just have to do.<br /><br />A little while ago I spent nearly fifty notes on the new Star Wars boxset, thinking that I'd invested in a huge, epic sci-fi cycle of unsurpassed quality. I had only ever seen SW4:ANH before making the purchase, so imagine my chagrin when I discovered that George Lucas really DOES have feet of clay.<br /><br />Alternatively, you can own this: half the cost, three times as big, ten tmes more intelligent and infinitely better entertainment value. I love the series and, if I don't write too many more film reviews over the next few months it's because I am wallowing in a glorious and endless Holmes-fest.<br /><br />Elementary.eries and, if I don't write too many more film reviews over the next few months it's because I am wallowing in a glorious and endless Holmes-fest.  Elementary.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm an avid reader, but I'm also picky, so I was hesitant to pick up the Hunger Games after the last teen cult fiction novel (Twilight, anyone?) was spoken so highly of, yet in my opinion so unimpressive. Regardless, that is not the point. The point is, this book is absolutely divine from beginning to end. I could not stop reading it. Easily the fastest read I've had since the Harry Potter books, and sometimes you just need an easier read...that is not to say that the story is lacking in any way. It reminded me of a cross between Ender's Game and 1984.
B005ER6SNM|5.0|I have seen many horrors in my life, both real and on film, and this was one of the most horrifying things I have ever seen. Its one thing to see the aftermath of the evils of humans but to watch the why and how of an event all in one steady stream is some what scarring. When you investigate violance you get it a piece at a time normally so you can take it in slowly, but to see it from start to finish in raw detail is........I can't even think of the words to discribe it. From a crime and psychoanalytical view it is very fasinating, which is also how I detached myself from this creation. As a movie, it was very well executed. You could get into the story and characters.<br /><br />I read many reviews of people speaking out about how they wish it was the uncut realese. The one I got from Amazon was graphic enough that ,even without the additional footage, the implied activities are disturbing enough without having to actually look at what you already know is happening. This movie IS NOT for the tame or meek. It takes a hard heart not to feel outrage and sorrow for the victims of this film. I give this film 5 stars for the fact that it is a very well done movie. I do not care for or agree with the graphic nature or subject of this movie. Yes, I was aware of what I was going to be veiwing and therefore can not write any derogatory postings. The most disturbing thing about this film is that things like this may happen in real life. I hope that I will never have to see this type of senario acted out. I've already seen enough to not have something like this setting on my chest. The movie was bad enough.

B006OAB3ME|4.0|Quite like a Run Devil Run Paul seamlesly adds original songs to his personal favorites from a generation of music he grew up with. Is everyone going to love fourties/fifties music if your not of that era? No. Still you can hear where John and Paul were influenced by some of these melody patterns and arrangments. He is suppose to follow this up with a Rock CD so relax and enjoy and broaden your horizons a little bit. I am a little concerned about his vocal range but it happens to the best of them, better enjoy it while we can.
067101756X|3.0|Philip Corso's book makes fun reading, and it's extremely well done. His narrative fiction weaves in and out of genuine historical events that Corso more than likely witnessed first hand. Unfortunately, any of the witnesses who would be able to corroborate or deny his rather wild claims about seeding United States corporate R & D's with alien technology are all dead. Corso's dead now, too, come to think of it.  At any rate, just be aware that when you order this book, you will receive a tome that is almost entirely fictional. Corso did NOT see a dead alien body in Junction City, KS, he did NOT have a mysterious file cabinet filled with dusty items recovered from the Roswell crash, he was NOT responsible for the invention of transistors, Kevlar, or fiber optic cables, and he did NOT single-handedly resolve the Cuban missile crisis during the term of John F. Kennedy.  The book just goes to show that in the crazy world of Ufology (or Ufoology!) even though the backgrounds, experience, or academic credentials of some who persist in researching this field may be impressive, qualified individuals are as prone to hucksterism, hoaxes, delusions, and outright whackiness or zaniness as anyone else! Corso's book fits ALL of the previous adjectives!

B006UG90RM|5.0|Van Halen has thrown the proverbial gauntlet down with \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\".  This is the kind of music I've been waiting for for the better part of 30 years!  Aside from the checkered history, controversies, drama and lengthy periods of M.I.A. status, these guys \\"BRING IT\\" with this entry!  While I wish Michael Anthony was in the lineup as much as anyone else, a lot of credit should probably go to Wolfie (for whom without, the reunion and this album may have not been possible).  Van Halen fans tend to be polarized as much as Democrats and Republicans when it comes to what version of Van Halen is the best...Comparing Sammy to Dave (or vice versa) has always been a hot topic.  Then there is that one solitary guy from some hole in the ground somewhere who likes he Gary Cherone incarnation best. I like both Sammy and Dave, but I lean towards DLR as a better fit.  Eddie is unmatched when it comes to the guitar, and in this album he milks the instrument for everything it's got!  Alex is a MONSTER on is album, and he lays down some bombastic rhythms on the skins. Wolfie ties it all together with a driving, thumping groove and a more prominent base sound than you usually hear on a Van Halen record.  Then there's Dave belting out his signature howls and squeals between verses. He tends to venture down to the lower spectrum of his vocal range more than the upper, but he can still get up in the rafters here and there. I really think Dave is underrated when it comes to lyrics, there is quite a bit of clever tongue-in-cheek humor laced throughout the record, which seems to be an element missing from most of today's music. Lovers of ballads are out of luck with this album, but might perhaps be assuaged by the first (and safest bet for the widest demographic reach) single \\"Tattoo\\" which seems to be more of a pop-trending warm up for the rest of the album. About half of these songs are re-worked from the so-called \\"Gene Simmons\\" or \\"Zero\\" demo tape made in the mid 70's andthe other half is mostly brand new material. While the use of old demos has ruffled some people's feathers, because it is old material, or whatever...Myself? I chalk it up to \\"unfinished business\\"...it should be noted that as a demo, the tape was never meant for mass consumption in the first place, and it only surfaced in more recent years for the most part thanks to a little thing called the \\"Internet\\". The sound of the album itself is reminiscent of \\"Women and Children First\\" and \\"Fair Warning\\" which in my opinion were some of the best and most underrated records they made. \\"Stay Frosty\\" has the undeniably clear resemblance to their debut album's \\"Ice Cream Man\\" but is still in and of itself an original scorching boogie with some blistering BIG guitar. It's hard to single out the highlights on an album this good, but my early favorites are \\"She's the Woman\\", \\"Big River\\", the seemingly biographic \\"Blood and Fire\\", \\"China Town\\", and \\"As Is\\" (which has an intro evocative of \\"Everybody Wants Some\\" and \\"Hot for Teacher\\". While the album hearkens back to the Van Halen Glory years, and parts of it may sound like \\"this old VH song or that old VH song\\"... It is by no means dated or stale. This is Van Halen, and it sounds like nothing else any other band can do! While giving long-time Van Halen fans a trip down memory lane, this album also breaks new ground and is a refreshing ROCK & ROLL album. For some reason, a lot of great bands from the 80's are still together and still put out some great music, but get little to no airplay on the radio. If this record is given a chance on the airwaves, I am thinking there is going to be a whole new generation of Van Halen fans.
B0064NTZJO|3.0|I didn't get a chance to see this one in theaters but I heard only good things about it so when I saw this in the Redbox I had to pick it up.<br /><br />The main problem with this story is that it just takes soooooo long to get started!  Seriously the conflict in this movie didn't start until like 20 minutes in.  At one point I thought I was watching, \\"A Day In The Life of a Driver,\\" or an action movie.<br /><br />It finally got going and the action was good until we got to the point where the driver goes into the strip club looking for the gangster.  The camera kept doing this slow pan around the room to get all the topless women into the shot and I just rolled my eyes.  Yep, that's what this movie needed to get people to come see it, a bunch of random extras topless.  It was just lame.<br /><br />Other than that the movie was pretty good and it's worth checking out!
B0068RHSCW|2.0|Plot: Family is murdered but dad survives; he's a suspect but not provable; placed in mental institution to sort out loss of family and is eventually released; story then starts.<br />The plot was figured out within a short time by some I know but I was fooled for about 3/4 hour and I've seen this type of movie before. However the weakness to me was that the ending was too rushed, cheap and far too improbable. It's like being set up for 85 minutes of decent storytelling to then allocate a mere 5 minutes to explain it all away.The acting was OK; not particularly challenging roles of a typical middle class family. Craig performed well; Watts didn't really have much to do; Weisz was more natural to this role than in Whistleblower but still nothing I'll remember a week from now.<br /><br />Spoiler:<br />The past dozen years has seen an increase in \\"It's all in your head movies.\\" Most maintain the illusion quite well depending upon acting and directing skill and most importantly the camera angles and editing. Camera angles will show the first person subjective view as if it's a reality and every so often the skilled director will slip in the hint objective views to allow the viewer to feel like a dummy at the film's conclusion.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|Okay, I'm not a big sports fan at all but Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill are pretty good actors so I figured that this would be pretty good.<br /><br />I really don't know much about baseball and this was an education about the inner workings of the statistics of the game.  I liked the character that Johan Hill played, he was timid yet intelligent at the same time which was a good combination.<br /><br />Watching them take a group of misfits that no other team wanted and put them together into a working team that could have gone all the way was really cool.<br /><br />I'm only giving it 4 stars cuz it did drag a little at the beginning.  If you like either actor or you just like baseball you should check it out.

B0025UHKNS|2.0|Although this is going to be a negative review, I'll start out by saying that I really enjoyed using this watch.  I took it biking, running, and skiing.  Garmin Connect is a really cool way to visualize your exercise, and I found all of the measurements (GPS, heart rate, etc.) to be plenty accurate.  The watch itself wasn't the most comfortable thing in the world, but at least it wasn't gigantic like some of the others out there.  Also, I found the bezel to be funky and not super-responsive...like other reviewers have said, it gets especially wonky when it's wet.  But overall, it's a neat product.  Now for the bad...  the quality of the product is abominable!  After six months, I had to send it back because the battery level sensor failed, and the watch would go into an infinite loop where it would start up, make a beep sound, erroneously detect that the battery was at 0% even when fully charged, shut itself off, start up ... and repeat until the battery goes dead.  Which takes about eight hours.  And there's no way to get it out of this cycle other than let it go.  The first time this happened was on a long run, and I was stuck hearing my watch beep every 15 seconds.  The second time was in the middle of a long haul flight, so I had to bury it in my luggage to keep the incessant beeping from annoying the passengers around me.  After that, I contacted Garmin.  Customer service was a mixed bag.  Any time you contact Garmin, they send you a confirmation saying that they'll get back to you within 3 days.  A conversation leading up to getting an RMA # can take over a week, which is kind of a bummer.  The processing time wasn't super zippy either...I was without my watch for two and a half weeks while they were getting a refurbished unit ready to ship to me.  So all in all, it took about a month between the unit failing and getting a replacement.  Perhaps I'm getting spoiled by companies like Apple and Amazon, but I found that to be quite slow.  This week, after one yearand two months, it's gone and broken on me again.  This time, it's turned into a paperweight--the screen's blank and nothing will get it to turn on.  After another week or so of going back and forth with customer service, Garmin has offered to fix it, but since it's outside of the warranty, they want a price that's 80% of the going price for a new one on Amazon.  Needless to say, I'm not planning on investing that kind of money on fixing a product that's already failed on me twice.  Overall, I'm giving two stars because I really enjoyed using the Forerunner while it worked--enough so that I'm now looking at similar offerings from other companies.  If the rating were for quality alone, I'd be giving one.

B000A7DVR2|5.0|It's 1991 in Los Angeles, and Time has occurred in two dimensions. A bizarro world has been created, where a wealthy philanthropist named Lebowski is mirrored in a skewed hippie deadbeat version also named Lebowski (The Dude). The Dude exists in a Bizarro Los Angeles where bowling is popular and CCR is too. However, he's about to come face to face with the Big Lebowski! The Dude's world will collide with another world, where L.A. is filled with schemers and criminals who enjoy In-n-Out Burger. The Dude gets caught up in a blackmail/kidnapping plot and is forced to help extort the Big Lebowski on behalf of three German Techo dancers. It is indeed a bizarro L.A., as one can only imagine. The Dude does things very differently in bizarro L.A., like making a White Russian with half and half. The semantics in bizarro L.A. are also skewed: The Dude refers to bowling as golfing, and Nihilists as Nazis. But, in some twisted way, that makes sense in any version of Los Angeles. The Big Lebowski is a film about two dimensions colliding in an epic battle for Los Angeles. It's unbelievable that this isn't widely considered a Sci-Fi Classic.<br /><br />2.342

With that in mind and 25+ years of being a metal fan I had to read this book.  I will start by saying I am happy I did. It was a fun read as a Metallica and Megadeth fan. I will try to keep this review short by pointing out the good and the bad IMOO. The good: For any fan of 80's metal who wants to relive the first moments of Metallica. Dave put's you there right at the beginning of the band, and all the way through to today. The first hand accounts of James and Lars in the early days is really cool, Dave's account of his first jam sessions with Metallica and his early metal name dropping is really cool as well. Dave continues to give first hand accounts of all past and present members of Megadeth and his account of how they left the band. It's a adventure that really dive's into the history of these two bands. Another good point is how Dave dives into his personal life. His rehab visits, wives, children, surgery and turn towards a Christian lifestyle.  Now the bad: Simply put Dave spends every page of this book pointing the finger at every person he has ever come across in the music business. His view of himself is more of a superman complex with the ability to use kung-fu to neutralize any situation. From the first page of the book he wants you to know he is the sole owner of Megadeth. That point is driven home from the first mention of Megadeth as he is quick to point out every fault of every former member.  This book reminded me of why I am a Megadeth fan, and not a Mustaine fan.Overall fun read for the metal fan. For me it changed the way I think of Dave Mustaine.

1451627289|5.0|What if you had a chance to go back in time and not only change events that scarred a friend forever but stop John F. Kennedy's assassination? Would you do it? When Jake Epping is given that chance he takes it and travels back in time as George Amberson to 1958 to help his friend and attempt to save Kennedy's life. He knows his journey won't be easy but even he is surprised at how much the past doesn't want to change. he prepares for events the best he can but one thing he isn't prepared for is falling in love. as he gets closer to stopping Lee Harvey Oswald he needs to be prepared for the possibility that if he succeeds it may be at a very high price.<br /><br />\\"11/22/63\\" reminds me a lot of earlier Stephen King novels in the sense that he created a character (Jake) that readers care about and a world that he immediately draws readers into. Jake reminds me a lot of John Smith from [[ASIN:0451155750 The Dead Zone (Signet)]] - not only is he a teacher like Johnny but Smith's quest was also political and they both made tremendous sacrifices for the sake of their country. The fantasy elements are well done - King does it so well that readers will believe you really can travel into the past - King also does an excellent job of blending history with fiction. As Jake listened to Oswald's conversations I often forgot I was reading a novel and thought they were actual documented conversations. King also does a good job of recreating the years 1958 to 1963 - a time where everybody smoked in public, a time before cell phones, cable TV, and the Internet. One of the things King does surprisingly well is the romance in the novel; another thing he does (as only he can do so well) is have the past itself as a character - a character that fights change as hard as it can. As always King treats long-time readers to a nod to previous books of his, most noticeably [[ASIN:0451169514 It]]. At over 800 pages the book is a bit too long and tends to slow down a bit in the middle but it speeds up towards the end and the last part is riveting reading. King sometimes doesn't seem to know how to end his books and that is partially true for \\"11/22/63\\" -parts of the ending don't quite work, felt a bit rushed and I was left thinking \\"he went all the way back in time just for this?\\". However, the very end of the book is brilliantly done, King at his best. I confess I had tears in my eyes when I was done with the book.<br /><br />\\"11/22/63\\" is a return of Stephen King to his classic form - one of his best novels in recent years. Even non-Stephen King fans should like this one.ards the end and the last part is riveting reading.

B005SFS4ZU|3.0|If you're a fan of this spectacular show, don't hold your breath for this edition. This show was extremely limited with their props due to the size of the stage. So much so that they even used an L.E.D. screen for the backdrop of the stage. It looked cheap.<br /><br />I bought this on Blu Ray because I thought 'how cool would it be to see this in HD?' Let me answer that question for you. Not cool at all. It was so HD that I could see the DEAD PIXELS in some of shots. Once or twice during the beginning when Andre first makes his appearance on stage. (There it was, front and center: two white dots). Then later when Raul is spinning around Christina towards the end of \\"Masquerade.\\" Did anyone Q.C. this Blu Ray before putting out an image with dead pixels???<br /><br />Another issue with this being on Blu Ray and being so HD: when the phantom first takes Christina through the mirror, it's dark and you can see the all the crazy blue dots (the grain in the footage) due to how dark it is.<br /><br />I was not impressed by the shot choices of this director. Too many close ups when he/she should have used wide shots for certain moments.<br /><br />Overall, the stage in my opinion wasn't big enough, the show wasn't as speculator as others before it (where was the giant elephant for the beginning scenes?), and the L.E.D. backdrop felt cheap. The only redeeming factor in my opinion was when Andrew Lloyd Weber makes an appearance at the end with the original cast and has Sarah Brightman sing. But not Michael Crawford...

1904994768|1.0|This book was not at all what I was expecting. If you stay up to date on video game news there is little new content for you in this book. It also cites VGChartz sales numbers, which are rough estimates which and are generally not recognized in the industry. NPD and GfK are the recognized sources for sales numbers. The data in the book also appears to only be through roughly Aug/Sep of last year. There are tables in the book that say accurate as of May 2011 and Aug 2011. I was expected it to be more up to date because it was published this year.

B0073PZIYI|1.0|I was so pumped to see this movie.  I liked the trailers and the concept and Justin Timberlake but... the pot sucked, the writing was awful, the acting was so bad and it just fell flat.  Painful to watch at times.  And unfortunately Justin TImberlake is not that strong enough an actor to make this movie better and also Dakota Fanning is just not a hot chick.  She was a very cute young smart girl casted in the right parts. But she should stay away from trying to be this sexy woman for the big screen.

B002GJT4XW|4.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone<br />Ultimate Edition Blu-Ray Review<br /><br />Year: 2001<br />Rating: PG<br />Runtime:  2 HRS 32 MIN (Theatrical), 2 HRS 39 MIN (Extended)<br /><br />Directed by: Chris Columbus<br />Starring:  Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman<br /><br />Film Rating:  3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />Video Rating:  3 out of 5<br />Audio Rating:  4 out of 5<br />Extras:  4 out of 5<br />Overall Rating:  4 out of 5 stars<br /><br />The Film<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a film I absolutely despised upon its release in November 2001.  At the time, I was a complete Harry Potter virgin and didn't know a \\"muggle\\" from a \\"bezoar\\" and I wasn't patient enough to give the film a chance.  It wasn't for several more years until I could sit down and actually enjoy this opening entry into one of the more magical (pun intended, stop rolling your eyes) franchises in recent memory.<br /><br />HP1 tells the story of a neglected 10 year old orphan with a lightning bolt scar on his forehead who is raised by his cruel aunt and uncle and finds out of his 11th birthday that he is in fact a wizard.  He travels to a distant magical school named Hogwarts where he meets new friends (and enemies), learns about how he received that lightning scar, what happened to his parents, and runs across an old foe in a new form.<br /><br />This film is extremely loyal to the book which is both a blessing and a curse.  Sorcerer's Stone is the shortest entry in the book series and that allows for a more literal adaptation when you have 150+ minutes to tell your story in the theater.  Unfortunately, the film doesn't take many risks when it comes to differentiating itself from the book.  Many fans appreciate how dedicated this film is to it's book but I think for the sake of pacing some liberties should have been taken.<br /><br />HP1's biggest problems come in the form of direction, acting, and effects:<br /><br />  -Sorcerer's Stone is directed by Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire) who is obviously very good at working with child actors but I've always felt that he is a little out of his element working on a film of this scale.  HP1 looks as though it could have been directed by anyone, it's competently directed but there's nothing to set it apart style wise.<br />  -Kid actors always seem to cause problems.  For every film with good child actor performances (think The Goonies) there's a movie filled Jake Lloyd (Anakin Skywalker, Star Wars Episode I) level actors. Sorcerer's Stone falls somewhere in the middle when it comes to the children's performances.  Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) and Rupert Grint (Ron) come off a lot better than Tom Felton (Draco) and especially Emma Watson (Hermione).  What's funny is, Emma Watson has put in some of the best performances in the later film entries so kudos to her for putting in the effort to become a much better actress.<br />  -CGI has come along way since 2001.  There are far too many scenes in HP1 where the effects have not aged well or just weren't that good in the first place.  The Quidditch match in particular is a scene that I remember rolling my eyes at when I first saw the film and it continues to take me out the film years later.<br /><br />There are a lot of good things working in favor of HP1.  Set direction, practical effects, sound design, and the soundtrack are among the many things in this film that are top notch.  The adult actors such as Alan Rickman, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, and Robbie Coltrane add a lot credibility to the film and usually seem to elevate the children's performances while in their presence.  The last thing you have to keep in mind when judging this film is the often forgotten fact that this is the setup film of a huge franchise.  Sorcerer's Stone had the near impossible task of introducing the characters and wizarding world to the movie going audience.  While I didn't appreciate this film upon my first viewing I've grown to enjoy it more now that I've seen and read what comes after.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Ultimate Edition Blu-Ray comes housed in a  sturdy blue cardboard case with slip cover.  Inside you'll find the movie blu-ray with both the theatrical and the extended cut of the film, a special features BD, a standard-def DVD of special features, a theatrical cut digital copy disc, a collectible book, two character cards (Harry Potter & Minerva McGonagall)<br /><br />As stated above, this set features both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film.  The extended cut runs approximately 7 minutes longer than the original cut.  Most of the extra footage are scene extensions and most novice Harry Potter fans won't notice any difference between the two.  Both cuts of the film appear to be mastered from the same source print which is identical to the transfer used for the 2007 HD-DVD and Blu-Ray editions of the film.  While the transfer is very good, it's not likely to blow anyone away but it is accurate to the designed look of the film.  I no longer own the SD DVD version of the film to compare this release to but I believe it would be safe to say this BD outclasses it in every conceivable way.  Black levels are very good, I didn't notice any crushing even in the darkest scenes.  Color accuracy was consistent and the level of detail is usually on par with what I've come to expect from Blu-Ray with only a few scenes appearing overly soft.  I didn't notice any use of Digital Noise Reduction since there is always an appropriate level of film grain visible during the film.<br /><br />Regarding the audio tracks, there several differences between the this and previously released editions but I doubt that most listeners will hear the difference.  Unlike the aforementioned HD-DVD and Blu-ray releases, which featured a Dolby TrueHD and an Uncompressed 5.1 PCM  track respectively, this release features a DTS-HD Master Audio 6.1 track for the theatrical cut and a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 for the extended cut.  The added channel for the theatrical cut most likely stems from the fact that when released in theaters this film was released in Dolby Digital Surround EX which is a 7 channel format.  Since the extended cut of the film adds back segments of the film that were never encoded in that format that cut of the film feature a 5.1 audio mix.<br /><br />Extras on this set range from wonderful to \\"I couldn't care less.\\"  I typically don't watch extras that aren't presented in HD so only extras presented in high definition will be included in this review.  The only significant extra on disc one is the PiP (Picture in Picture) commentary track from director Chris Columbus.  The track is sporadic at best with Columbus popping up more frequently the farther a long into the film we go.  He's interesting to listen to and seems to have fond memories of working on the film but there are long  gaps without his input that hinders this from being a must watch for anyone but the most die hard HP fans.  Since disc one's only special feature is the PiP track disc two houses the rest.  First off is a brief introduction by Daniel Radcliffe which is both amusing and a little creepy.  He makes it clear in no uncertain terms that you'll absolutely love the Ultimate Edition Blu-Rays and you'll learn things about Harry Potter that you never knew.  The best special feature included on the set (and for some the entire reason they bought the set) is the Creating the World of Harry Potter Part 1:  The Magic Begins documentary.  This is part one of the eight part series with a new installment being included on each new Ultimate Edition set.  The Magic Begins is presented in HD and looks as though great care and effort has been put into the documentary.  Each documentary is themed and as the title leads you to believe this segment dives into the launching the franchise.  Most of the interviews with cast and crew are newly produced and everyone is very candid about what led to certain decisions being made, what works and doesn't work, and how it those decisions affected future films.  It's an interesting look back at the beginning of the franchise especially now that we're so close to the release of The Deathly Hallows Part 2.  Other extras include 10 minutes worth of deleted scenes.  Most of these scenes are what make up the Extended Cut of the film so your not going to see any hidden treasures if you already watched that version of the film.  The only other extras on disc two are the teaser trailer, two full trailers, and 15 television spots all presented in standard definition (SD trailers, etc. are inexcusable in this day and age).  Disc three extras are all presented in SD and are recycled from previous editions of the film so I didn't even bother wasting the time to put the disc in my player.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a faithful adaption of the inaugural Potter book.  A number of issues, namely the children's performances, the bland direction, and some spotty CGI hinder the film from being truly magical.  It does however setup the world of Harry Potter effectively, tells the story competently, and looking back, makes enough good decisions to help future Potter films succeed in ways this film could never achieve.<br /><br />Highly Recommended for any Potter fan with money to burn.  If you're unsure if Harry Potter is right for you I suggest checking out the single disc Blu-ray, it will only cost you around $10 so your financial risk is a lot smaller.  The disc sports the same transfer, similar audio, it doesn't include The Magic Begins doc, or the extended cut of the film but if you're looking for the cheapest HP1 option this is it.t that when released in theaters this film was released in Dolby Digital Surround EX which is a 7 channel format.

B006E4QCXU|4.0|love the way it moved nice being able to change it around great for a bit of fun worth buying worth keeping if you interact with little kids but other wise after a bit it gets old, The work that went into it is wonderful and it will keep my 8 year old busy she loves to show it to her friends. Other wise buy it, play with it, show it off and  after that it just eats space kinda like a lava lamp after a while it become (ya and the point is???) So if you have $2 to blow sure if your pinching every penny spend it on something else
B0057R5XRG|4.0|Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy Blu-ray Review<br /><br />I absolutely fell in love with Jurassic Park the first time I saw it in 1993. It, along with Terminator 2: Judgement Day, are the two films that I think really changed movies and Hollywood in general. Jurassic Park may be the very definition of popcorn flick but it has an intriguing premise thanks to author Michael Critchon, a perfect cast, a director who knows how to balance awe with terror, and top notch visuals that still hold up well 18 years later.<br /><br />This is undoubtedly the best Jurassic Park has ever looked but it is showing some signs of age. That doesn't bother me in the least however, Jurassic Park was an early entry into the world of CGI and some shots don't hold up as well in 1080P resolution. Overall detail is leaps and bounds better than the DVD but there are some scenes that suffer from crushing blacks. There is also a noticeable amount of grain which is occasionally overpowering but I'd rather see too much grain than have it completely scrubbed away with excessive DNR. Jurassic Park holds the distinction of being the first film released in DTS and even after 18 years it still sounds great. Bass is nice and tight, the surround channels are used often and to great affect, and dialogue is always crystal clear even when the T-Rex and Raptors are causing havoc all over the park.<br /><br />The special features on Jurassic Park are also good. The headliners are the newly produced Return to Jurassic Park documentaries that are included on each disc. The first segments make up the bulk of the extras on disc one. Dawn of a New Era, Making Prehistory, The Next Step in Evolution run about an hour back to back to back and are really well done and feature interviews with much of the cast and crew and give a great look inside of the entire process that brought Jurassic Park to life. There are also some older extras including a Making of... documentary, assorted featurettes, and a SD trailer.<br /><br />Film: 4 out of 5 stars<br />Video: 3 out of 5 stars<br />Audio: 4 out of 5 stars<br />Extras: 4 out of 5 stars<br /><br />The Lost World<br />Year: 1997<br />Rating: PG-13<br />Runtime: 2 HR, 9 MIN<br /><br />A phoned in sequel that is technically superior to its predecessor in almost every way except in plotting and heart. I hadn't seen The Lost World in a number of years and it's actually a better film than I remember giving it credit for but it's still far from a great film. The same year Spielberg directed Jurassic Park he also directed Schinder's List, similarly the same year he directed The Lost World he turned around and directed Amistad. In 1993 he directed two back-to-back classics (albeit completely different types of classics) and in 1997 Spielberg attempted to repeat that success and came up short. Not all the blame falls on Speilberg, Critchon's novel didn't do the film any favors. The Lost World tries to upstage Jurassic Park at every turn but something creatively was lost... and why does Jeff Goldblum have a black daughter? They couldn't find any other way to work a black guy or gal into the film?<br /><br />Even though Jurassic Park looked very good The Lost World's video transfer easily beats its predecessor. Black levels are superb, the level of detail is good, and while there's a layer of grain present it never comes close to being overpowering. The audio is even better than the video and if I had to sum it up in one word it would be \\"Spectacular!\\" The dialogue is always crystal clear, all seven channels come alive with a flurry of activity, and your subwoofer will get a wonder workout because the bass is intense.<br /><br />Extras on The Lost World fall short of what was included with Jurassic Park. Two documentaries are included; Finding the Lost World and Something Survived are decent but it's a bit of a circle jerk with lots of people saying how great the film is but never mentioning some of the issues that hinder The Lost World. The rest of the special features are pretty forgettable with some \\"vintage\\" featurettes, some semi-interesting deleted scenes, and a poor looking standard definition trailer.<br /><br />Film: 2 out of 5 stars<br />Video: 4 out of 5 stars<br />Audio: 5 out of 5 stars<br />Extras: 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />Jurassic Park III<br />Year: 2001<br />Rating: PG-13<br />Runtime: 1 HR, 32 MIN<br /><br />There are movies I hate and then THERE ARE MOVIES I HATE. Jurassic Park III definitely falls in latter category. For a movie that was filmed almost 10 years after the original film some of the effects looks downright terrible. Pay close attention to the dinosaur attack when the plane is stuck in the tree, ask yourself \\"If Spielberg directed this would it look this bad?\\" It's a lazily written film where somehow another kid that's wise beyond their years end up on dinosaur island. JP3 is filled with tons of clich&eacute; action staples and clocks in at an embarrassingly short 92 minutes.

Either way, \\"Welcome back to Jurassic Park.\\"eted scenes, and a poor looking standard definition trailer.  Film: 2 out of 5 stars  Video: 4 out of 5 stars  Audio: 5 out of 5 stars  Extras: 3 out of 5 stars  Jurassic Park III  Year: 2001  Rating: PG-13  Runtime: 1 HR, 32 MIN  There are movies I hate and then THERE ARE MOVIES I HATE. Jurassic Park III definitely falls in latter category. For a movie that was filmed almost 10 years after the original film some of the effects looks downright terrible. Pay close attention to the dinosaur attack when the plane is stuck in the tree, ask yourself \\"If Spielberg directed this would it look this bad?\\" It's a lazily written film where somehow another kid that's wise beyond their years end up on dinosaur island. JP3 is filled with tons of cliché action staples and clocks in at an embarrassingly short 92 minutes.

B004FOA84A|5.0|Beautiful graphics, wonderful puzzles, interesting story line. I'm looking forward to a sequel. This was a well thought out game.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is honestly one of the most addicting games I have on my Kindle Fire. It's free...and if I were you I would get it NOW.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire. Its turned out to b invaluable to me. I can be anywhere and still access every computer in my house. When I first downloaded this app I wasn't sure I'd really use it, or even needed it. I was wrong. This app really simplifies everything, regardless of where I am. I only gave 4 stars because it can be a little confusing and has a steep learning curve especially if you're not computer savy.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Finally something cool to enjoy, visually stunning, speaks volumes with few words.. would like to see on big screen! Buy this movie!!!! Oh be advised, has some very graphic violence, but sometimes survival requires it..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This beautifully written novel absorbs the reader from its very first pages.  The author creates a vivid world whose logic immediately convinces and never flags, while the immersive process of learning the arbitrary rules of a game where error is fatal alongside Katniss and her fellow competitors suggests a world not so far from our own, with its lust for reality shows, and their abject humiliation of contestants. The Hunger Games is that rare novel that transcends age, gender, and genre, and thus deeply repays any reader's time.
0393340244|2.0|The author does a great job researching ideas that support her theory, many being valid. There are, however, a few incredibly important pieces missing. One of these is: Physical Differences.<br /><br />The author completely ignores physical diffferences. While using media and societies as a scapegoat to explain why differences exist, she fails to include the fact that children will relate to others with the same body parts and that their body mechanics shape how they percieve themselves and react to gender. Muscle mass, peeing abilities, reproduction...all shape our gender both in perception and abilties.<br /><br />Another piece missing runs parallel to the physical: Why are there concise physical differences creating the two genders? A female gives birth to the species, a male does not. A male does not need to think like a female because of this. And personally, I wouldn't want to live in a society without these specializations because then it wouldn't be special would it?<br /><br />These points are ignored by the author and cannot be explained away via a \\"I see, I do\\" theory.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Love this app! It offers so many different translations to read from. My only complaint is that it sometimes crashes.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|as I first played I thought it was pretty hard. but an attainable hard unlike a lot of apps I've tried and became so frustrated never to try again. but this has the perfect level of difficulty, for me anyway. and no errors or force closes to report.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|Item arrived very fast. Was exactly as advertised.  It is a region free set as the description stated.  I tried all disks in my US PS3 first.  They all work excellent.  The only thing I noticed was the initial load took a long time.  It must have something to do with the region coding.  But they work well once they come up.  I then tried them all on my LG stand alone bluray player in the living room. Same result.  I love this series and for the price it is a steal.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I can't imagine this being for kids...it can be tricky. It's fun though! Lots of different kinds of levels. Sometimes there are too many instructions and sometimes not enough.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a great game. I got it on free app day and I would pay a buck for it though. Injustice can't say enough about this kid friendly game!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|\\"a rollercoaster that only goes up\\"  John Green is truly an amazing author. His words are just so eloquent and captivating. The story makes you feel such raw and real emotions. I cried and laughed and cried even more. THIS is what contemporary fiction should be. Having known people who have had cancer and how much it takes a toll on the people you love, this one was especially hard to get through but I would have kicked myself if I had never read it. And it would shock me so if, after having read this book, you did not shed a few tears. Me? Let's just say I was on the verge of being torrential. Anyway... READ. THIS. BOOK. Because it would be a shame if you never experienced the beauty of what was written on these pages...
B001HN690O|5.0|The price was right, I received it right away and my daughter loves this movie!!!!  I enjoyed it as well.  Blu-ray is very expensive in the stores, but Amazon always has good deals on movies.  Fun movie for kids!
B0062NAVXA|3.0|The message in this movie is absolutely right-on. Though, it doesn't compare to the other movies made by this group. There are a few funny and touching moments. But, I wish I had rented it before buying it. To me, it's not worth buying.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this works perfectly on the kindle fire and makes it so easy to download youtube videos in either video or mp3 music only format
B000ZHVD7W|4.0|This movie has a uniquely depressing quality from the sepia tone and the sharp jagged<br />sets, the hideous crazy old men and that soundtrack.  You'd better be very well balanced to withstand that musical score or I don't recommend you watch this.  Over an hour of agonizing minor key violin scratchings will leave you a bit warped and depressed.<br /><br />Crazy old Dr. Caligari finds himself a \\"somnambulist\\" finally, a guy who never wakes up, and uses him to commit murders as he travels around in traveling circuses.  He keeps him in a coffin like box.<br /><br />Finally we see the straighjackets appear at the end when the Dr. gets put in one and thrown in a cell at the asylum.  This was interesting as an old German film.  No one does gloom like the Germans.<br /><br />I found the sets interesting, as it clearly is done the way plays are done, each scene looking like a stage play with backdrops and sets.  Nothing but jagged sharp shapes throughout.  That violin soundtrack was the true horror.  It was almost unbearable and never let up for a second.  It wasn't terribly entertaining but for someone who loves horror  movies and wants to see a truely unique antique of one this is worth watching.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I though it was the same as the free one. But with no ads to skip through but it does not take long people so save your money.
B005SS2QXS|3.0|Bought this for a new Iphone 4s. The case fits fine without affecting any functions. Cover is made of only one piece of rubber. I was expecting something more rugged. Doesn't have plastic cover for screen to prevent from scratching.Product description is a bit general. This is a good simple case. Bought  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004R97CXI/ref=mp_s_a_3?qid=1329348242&sr=8-3 (Griffin Survivor Extreme Duty) instead.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This sharpener is perfect for use as a carry along in a hike pack, camping pack, or in a G.O.O.D. pack.  It will sharpener many styles of knives thanks in part to the three different sharpening parts.  I bought two extras for each of my type of bags.  Again I would highly recommend this for campers and hikers especially if you are hiking in areas where you can get lost easily and made need to sharpen a knife a couple of times before your found.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I thought this was a really fun game... great to waste time, I play it all the time! I totally recommend this game if you're going on a long trip. 5 stars!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like this game a lot!  I usually play it using a stylus which I find easier to slingshot the birds with than my finger.
B005EM8O8O|1.0|This book has it all - poor character development, lazy plotting and a lame finish. You're never going to care much about any of the characters, the technology is only partially explained - and not very well at that - and the plot is completely uncompelling. This theme is a standard for sci-fi and has been handled much better almost everywhere else - just because it's set in the world of finance doesn't make it less of a boring slog. Save your money.
B005LAIGN2|2.0|I'm giving one star for good action scenes and another star for some of the history. The Tuskegee Airmen were real, they did serve with distinction, and there was discrimination and segregation.<br /><br />However, George Lucas unnecessarily dumbed down the story - ostensibly for dramatic effect? - to a degree that I found extremely annoying. I might have forgiven the clich&eacute;d and one-dimensional depiction of the German fighters as not merely racist but also evil. The Americans may have been racist, but they were not evil. :-) But I can't forgive the depiction of the white American fighters as unrepentant glory seekers who abandon their bomber squadrons - time and time again - in order to pursue a few decoy German fighters. This film implies that the only reason the all-black 332nd Fighter Group was given the opportunity to escort a bomber squadron was because white escorts were not reliable. The film also implies that when bomber squadrons had white escorts there were far more casualties, but with the 332nd there were very few or none. Indeed, there was one scene showing how surprised the bomber pilots were that the black fighters were not going to abandon them as the white fighters would.<br /><br />Now, if there is ANY truth to this, that white fighters were not reliable and often abandoned the bomber squadrons they were supposed to protect, then I will apologize and revise my review. But I see this as a huge red flag that history is not just being dramatized, or revised, but mangled. By stooping so low, Lucas isn't honoring the distinguished Tuskegee Airmen.<br /><br />P.S. I wonder if the folks who are giving me negative votes could tell me why in the comments section? I'm curious. Do you disagree with the substance of my criticism, that this movie inaccurately portrays white fighter pilots as unreliable?
B00000B9N3|5.0|How on earth do you categorise a disc like this? Wagner himself used to moan about walking into St. Mark's Square in Venice and having to acknowledge execrable performances, usually of his Rienzi Overture, played by the local bands outside the cafes.<br />The performances on this disc are anything but execrable. But otherwise the situation is much the same. This is a band, playing outside a cafe in St. Mark's Square in Venice, with all the ambient sounds going on around.<br /><br />That said, I have to admit to a huge affection for this recording - and that from a devoted and purist devotee of the Meister's works for many years. Uri Caine is a phenomenon. His recordings of Mahler, of Bach's Goldbergs and Beethoven's Diabellis are ear-opening, shifting and changing the original material to cast new light on the composers' works. I believe they are always respectful, despite including outrageously bluesy versions of some of the Goldbergs, for example, or sharp, acrid Klezmer views of Mahler.<br /><br />These Wagner arrangements, however, are relatively straight, given the accordion-led cafe band instruments available. And the music is played without send-ups or irony - judicious tempos are chosen throughout and the instrumentations always enhances the music played.<br /><br />And then city adds moving touches of its own - cafe society hums along with the Pilgrims' Chorus from Tannhauser, the Venetian church bells add their clamour to the climax of the Meistersinger Overture. Caine and his group are afraid of nothing. Forget 'Apocalypse Now': you simply haven't experienced the Ride of the Valkyries till you've heard it played by a small cafe band in the open air in St. Mark's Square.<br /><br />I would urge you to listen to this disc with an open mind. Chances are you will either love it or hate it. If you've ever been to Venice, the odds for loving it probably improve. I find it very moving in its integrity to the composer's intentions, despite its remoteness from what he had in mind for this music, as well as in its evocation of place. Remember, this was a city that Wagner loved and where he died.in its evocation of place. Remember, this was a city that Wagner loved and where he died.
B000002B2T|5.0|I'd been wanting this cd for years and forgot it was even out there until I heard a song on my satellite radio and it reminded me.  What an awesome cd!
B002IR3PSC|5.0|What strikes me most about this long-awaited release is its sound.  Even though the beginning of the video is not much visually (give 'em a break -- they didn't have anything to work with), the sound is immaculate.  The surround really does envelope the listener and the performances are stellar.  This particular band could be considered the most dangerous of all Tull line-ups.  The only thing missing is John Glascock's incredible bass playing.  Tony Williams does a great job filling in, but Glascock was a truly fantastic, innovative player.  One thing I wondered was how, at sucn short notice, Williams was able to learn Tull's complex material.  Anyway, on to the visual.<br /><br />Ian Anderson was clearly playing to the camera, with his stage antics more frenetic than usual.  The band was in top form, though and, to be fair, Anderson's flute playing was nothing short of incredible, particularly during his solo.  Barriemore Barlow's performance was also show-stopping.  I only wish there had been more time for him to show off some of the more unorthodox equipment as he did in \\"Velvet Green\\" from the Sight and Sound performance from a few years earlier.  John Evans' stage antics were also pretty \\"out there,\\" but again, like Anderson, his playing was beyond reproach.  Between his and David Palmer's playing, their sound was heavenly.  I wish Tull could've employed two keyboard players in subsequent line-ups.  As good as all those players were, it was nice to have that \\"fat\\" sound that Evans and Palmer brought to the proceedings, thus bolstering all the majestic sounds going on around them.  And, of course, Martin Barre's playing was nothing short of excellent.<br /><br />I liked the song selection, particularly \\"No Lullaby\\" from Heavy Horses.  It was a most unorthodox choice done to great effect.  The opening with the 11-plus minute \\"Thiok as a Brick\\" was also quite the unusual opener.  One could tell they were feeling a little rushed, but they managed to squeeze in as many songs as they could in the time allotted.  \\"Songs From the Wood\\" was another inspired choice.<br /><br />The \\"after broadcast\\" section was also very interesting.  I'm sure the audience wondered what was going on with the repetition of \\"Locomotive Breath,\\" but the band came through with flying colors all around, so it would be difficult for me to believe that that audience would walk out of Madison Square Garden disappointed.  I'm really glad this show was released.  It bears similarities to Bursting Out, the live album they had out at the time, but the uniqueness of the circumstances made it essential, in my opinion.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wanted to see a truly great live band at the absolute top of their game.any songs as they could in the time allotted.  \\"Songs From the Wood\\" was another inspired choice.<br /><br />The \\"after broadcast\\" section was also very interesting.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun but some of the games ore easy and some too hard.  points are inconsistent. overall slightly addictive. its free so I shouldn't complain and good to get your mind off things
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Simply amazing. A real shame it didn't continue. Make sure to pick up the movie, \\"Serenity\\" to continue where this season leaves off!
B00466HM28|4.0|I bought the MPK mini a few weeks ago, and just got it today (Feb, 15, 2012) After playing it a bit, I'd say this is surely worth the $80 I paid. Only problem that I have are the Keys are a bit stiff, but, I'm pretty sure that will fix itself in time. As I said before though, Good product, slow shipping. I waited nearly 3 weeks to get this in the mail. But overall I'm glad I got it.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|This album might be the perfect coda to Paul's career. I mean that in a kind sense. He's done everything, and broke every rule, and invented new rules along the way. It's like he's home with his mum and pop when he was a kid, listening to the gramophone.<br /><br />If you like Nat King Cole, or Fats Waller, or Diana Krall, you will love this album.
0312641893|5.0|[...]    I always love retelling of Cinderella. The cover is gorgeous, the red heel. Before I read this, I always wonder they show the bone. I didn't want to read the summary on goodreads because I didn't want to get spoiled or anything. I was so excited to finally get the book from the library!    As you know, It's a retelling of Cinderella. There's a step mother and two step sisters. The weird part is that one of the step sisters is really nice. Which is Cinder's friend. The Cinderella in this book name is Linh Cinder. I'm guessing everyone calls them by their last name? There's so much twist and turns in this book is like AHHHH!    Which one is eviler? The Queen or the Step mother? Oh I have no idea.... Both of them are so -___- I hate them both. I'm pretty sure all you guys already read this. So who do you think is evil?    I think this take place in the future. What I mean is, 4000. Cinder found a car and she said that they are ancient....    I really enjoy this book. I can't believe we have to wait for a year for the second book to come out. I finish this in a day. It was really really good! If you haven't read this yet, you need too!
B005K17RU0|5.0|its a good app to use i found it to be very helpful in times of need I revoked it for everyone
B006PHD0RW|4.0|since I read some reviews that said you could only get to play once then it wouldn't load a 2nd time, I played this for 6 hours straight without closing.  I unlocked everything.
B0063IH60K|5.0|can't put it down. every game becomes a new challenge. highly recommended for every solitaire player. if you love challenges, download this game.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Absolutely love this cover for my Kindle Fire. I have gotten many compliments. It is so easy to put on and the Kindle fits so snugly inside. It is great for keeping the kindle protected.
0525422943|4.0|I actually would rate this book a 4.5 if allowed.  I read the first book in this series, and really enjoyed it though I had some issues with the flash backs slowing the pacing down.  I found I liked this book quite a bit better than the first one.  The story seemed to stay more fluent with the current tale and the flash backs that were there seemed very relevant to the storyline.  I didn't get frustrated with them until possibly the last couple of chapters, and that wasn't because they weren't good ... it was just my own impatience of wanting to find out what was going to happen.  I really like the issues the author dealt with and how she wrote them out in a very believable manner.  I felt that Adam and Mia were extraordinary kids with their musical gifts, but it didn't seem far fetched at all to me, since I've been raised around the music world myself.  I also felt their souls were deep, and their grief, pain and issues were very real.  I could totally see these things playing out between them for real, as each person tries to overcome the influence of tragedy in their own lives.  Great story!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I installed this game because I thought it would begun for the kids. The kids haven't even got to play if yet because I can't put if down! Very entertaining!

B004SBQGHS|5.0|A great game.  Although the game has a cut exterior, it is a rather sophisticated game.  You need to think about gravity, velocity, trajectory, and structural weak points to be successful.

B005HSG3U6|3.0|I love the case but there is one major flaw... the back. The back material starts to chip off and it starts to look like it is two different kinds of whites. I don't know if it does the same on the black one but it definitely does on the white one.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|Fun game. Enjoy it. It freezes yup. Trouble rotating items and grabbing them. Screen doesn't seem to work with this game. I have a my touch 4g... Would b 5  stars if it worked.

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I have the previous FFVII Advent Children that was released on UMD for the PSP. While I enjoyed it, I always felt the story was choppy and hard to follow unless you were a FFVII fan who had played the game before.<br /><br />I just finished watching FFVII AC Complete on Blu-ray. The extra content in the Complete Blu-ray version really enhances the story and makes it more coherent. Definitely worth buying it again.<br /><br />My only quibble is that I don't have a HD TV so I cannot read the DVD menu selections on my old TV screen. The letters are very tiny and blurry. I have to use trial and error to navigate through the menus to get to the Language, Scene Select and Special Features options. The movie itself looks very good, no complaints there.<br /><br />Maybe someday I'll be able to afford a new HD TV so I will be able to enjoy the movie at its best.

B00479SVBU|5.0|This is a fantastic unit.  It is easily the best FM transmitter I've ever used.  I use it in my 2007 Mercedes as it did not come with an AUX input.  It holds the signal very strongly and has never had a problem.  The audio quality is very good.  I noticed that I had to adjust the bass and treble differently than I do with the CD player or with my previous FM transmitter.  I had to turn the treble up quite a bit to get it to sound like the other sources.  Not really a complaint, just an observation.  Great product!  I highly recommend it!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Really fun game well worth the purchase.  Everthing goes together so well in this game.  Tons of polish and it shows.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|My husband and I played this game together....fun bonding time! We liked all the puzzles and the hidden finds. Worked great on my Kindle Fire. Well worth the $ spent. Only thing I would change is I would make it have a multiple player mode as I have kids that borrow my Kindle and I dont want them advancing on my game! Have bought two games from Fire Maple and loved them both.....hope they come up with more!

0812992792|3.0|I was enthralled by the first part of this book and read it quickly.  It set up a compelling character in a fascinating new world, and dealt with the absurdity of its setting with a dark humor that conveyed horror without descending into pathos.  I struggled with the second half, however.  The story gets much more complicated, strains credulity (even for North Korea), and introduces a cast of characters whose roles in the plot are difficult to follow.  In addition, the writing jumps back and forth in time, adding to the confusion and detracting from the story's force, and draws out the climax for far too long.  The litany of horrors becomes rote - the ninth torture scene is unfortunately not more powerful than the first - and almost numbs the reader.  With good editing, the novel could have been much tighter and more powerful.  As it is I was relieved when it finally ended.  It's worth reading, but it's not as good as it could have been.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|reading the Bible has slowly but surely changed my life rven though i always thought i would never leave my ways behind
0812550706|2.0|To a mature reader this book will insult you. After thinking over the story I realized that this story is more geared for 5th graders than Twilight is geared for girls. The premise is a \\"genius\\" boy named Ender is chosen by the military to save the world. He gets taken into space away from his mean brother, his parents that don't love him, and the school bully. Once in space he \\"trains\\" in battle school. His training consists of 100 pages of zero gravity laser tag and playing video games. Which is honestly the best part of the book. *Spoiler*The ending is quite anti-climactic. Basically, Ender plays a war simulator video game for 1 week and it gradually gets harder. When he beats the final boss he is told that he was actually controlling a real army and he defeated the enemy and won the war. The author finds a way to end the conflict without establishing anything about the villains and with 0 suspense. If you want to see a shorter, better version of ender's game. Watch the south park episode called \\"Best Friends Forever\\".  10 year-old: 3/5  Adult: 1/5
0312641893|4.0|I won this book in the goodreads first reads program and had such high expectations for this book based on some great reviews.  I gave this book 4 stars, when I really wanted to give it 5, but the book didn't really take off for me until I passed the first 100 pages.  Through the the first half of the book, I was really  waiting for it to take off and I was skeptical if it would for me.  As soon as I passed that 100 page mark, all I could do was hold on because I was completely pulled into this book.  I did see some similarities with the retelling of Cinderella, but I feel like this book was full of more depth that where the similarities stopped, the differences flourished.<br /><br />Cinder is a unique and fresh character where she lives in New Beijing as the top mechanic.  After a hover accident when she was little, Cinder is now a cyborg, part machine and considered a second class citizen.  Living in a small home with her step-mom and two stepsister's where she works to pay her family's way.  Cinder doesn't remember much about her childhood, except she lost her parents in the hover accident.  Orphaned, she was later adopted by her step-dad before he dies shortly after.  Cinder's step-mom has always made it clear she was never wanted and has treated her like a burden.  Though her older stepsister is what you would expect with this retelling, hateful and selfish, it's the younger sister, Peony that Cinder forms a bond with.  I loved seeing that Cinder had found a friend with Peony, though Peony's character was short lived in this book, she left a lasting impression on Cinder.  I even enjoyed little Iko and her spunk and am hoping Cinder will be able to reconnect with her again.<br /><br />I'm having a hard time writing this review without giving away some spoilers, there was just so many interesting aspects in this story and I feel they deserve a mention.  During the last half of the book, things started coming together and the story started to pick up speed.  Kai, the prince and Cinder's love interest, didn't have too many scenes, but when he stepped on the page, you took notice.  The spark between them was there, like a small burn.  I can see it, I'm just waiting for it to grow.  They definitely have obstacles to jump and circumstances to get past and overcome.  I can feel that Kai has a big heart and I can't wait to see what will happen with these two.<br />So many great plot points that kept this story rolling.  The plague that has been sweeping the planet, the Lunar's and the Lunar Queen, the army that the Lunar Queen has been hiding, finding out exactly who and what Cinder is.  All great aspects and what has me hooked.  I cannot wait to continue and see how everything plays out.er's love interest, didn't have too many scenes, but when he stepped on the page, you took notice.

B006UG90RM|1.0|I give up. I will never buy another CD until I know whether the recording has been subjected to dynamic compression or not. For those who don't know, dynamic compression is where the all the sounds, from the loudest to the softest, has been made equal. They virtually eliminate the dynamic range so the music sounds better on crappy iPod earbuds, which apparently has become the choice of speakers for our tone deaf nation. The rest of us who have invested a modicum of moolah on our stereo equipment are left out in the cold because the recording industry refuses to release an alternative dynamically correct version for audiophiles. In the case of dynamic compression, an audiophile is anyone who listens to music on anything but earbuds. Hey, recording industry, listen up! The people you make your horrible dynamically compressed music for aren't buying your CDs anyway, they're stealing them. So quit catering to people who take you for suckers and start doing things right for those who still care about audio quality. If anyone wants to learn more about dynamic compression, search for \\"loudness wars\\" on you tube. Or go to Turn Me Up dot org to join a non-profit music industry organization campaigning to give artists back the choice to release more dynamic records.

0307888908|3.0|The authors do a decent job of repackaging and repurposing a lot of information that has been covered in other books of this type.<br /><br />That's not meant as a criticism per se, but more as an observation. In 2012, it's hard for any writer to be \\"original\\" and inventive with material that has been covered in thousands of magazine and newspaper articles if not thousands of books for the last decade and longer.<br /><br />Only you can judge whether Hoffman's experience as a cofounder of LinkedIn adds to the credibility and/or relevance of this book. Certainly his professional experience provides him with plenty of stories. (If anything, I think the book could do with some weeding out of the stories and personal sharing.)<br /><br />It's not a bad book and if you're new to this genre, you'll probably find a lot of helpful information and inspiration.<br /><br />Overall, the book could benefit from more graphics. Given its content, the publisher and authors could have worked together for a more creative and imaginative visual presentation of the material as we have come to expect from books on this subject. (And I am a reader so it's not the density of text or length. It's that I feel a lot of the content could be enhanced by visuals, which increases both readability and accessibility and impact of the content points.)<br /><br />This is the kind of book I might give as a gift to someone who is in their last year of college as a pre-graduation \\"job-hunting\\" primer that's useful whether one is going the corporate route or considering striking out on their own or joining a start-up.<br /><br />As others have noted, it would have been great if Hoffman shared some of what he learned (we're talking quantitative information here, not anecdotal) as it applies to job seekers and those contemplating a business start-up by themselves or with others. That's a big missing piece I would have wanted to read.
0062101897|4.0|This is a very good choice for any fan of the Harry Potter movies. It details the 'making of' each film, then looks at costumes, locations, creatures (digital ones only) and props. There is a nice mix of large photos, smaller snapshots and text. I'd say it's a 60-40 picture to text ratio.  My only complaints, in fact, were that there is no information of the creatures of Harry Potter that were actually live animals (Hedwig, Crookshanks and Scabbers) and I wished there were more photos from the movies instead of so many early concepts and artist renderings. This was especially true in the prop and costume sections. I wanted to see some of the things there talking about instead of a full page drawing of Hermoine (where you couldn't even tell what she was wearing!)  But those are small complaints. I'm still completely happy with this book. It's a must for every Potter fan.
0553381350|4.0|Airplanes, astronauts, NASA, government, top secret missions, etc. You name it, it's there. This is exactly the type of book a guy would even hesitate to pick off a bookshelf. For a girl well, it can be contemplated, given that she is completely into emotional drama and maybe a bit of political science, as I was. In the beginning of the novel I thought the book was confusing. However, it is definitely the book to read if you have been in the military at one point or another, or are a NASA geek.<br /><br />It is of course an interesting perspective coming from the pilots themselves and not their representatives: the press. Tom Wolfe's frankness and acceptation of reality sheds light into the harsh world that astronauts had to live in. They worship legends like Chuck Yeager, telling stories of their youth as if peering into their lives through a looking hole. The one thing I am certainly, truly exhilarated about in this book is the imagery Wolfe uses to recreate the scenes. I feel that by far my favorite part was when Wolfe demonstrates to the reader what fears pilots face when landing their planes. He uses several situations and people to describe the experiences and thoughts the pilots are going through at a certain time. In one minute only, they have so many different thoughts going on that it is almost unfathomable and obviously mind blowing to read so many emotions running through them all at once. An example of this is when he says, \\"Just look at the beast...\\" and then shows his reaction versus the pilot's.<br /><br />Most of this story is made up of dialogue and so it is easy to follow and imagine the scene as it plays out. He varies with the type of language he uses frequently. He shifts from geeky airplane terms to informal speaking between commoners to absolute informal as in using bad words. This helps the story to flow well and clears up grey areas in the storyline that one doesn't really understand till they read what the pilots have to say. Another goodtool that Wolfe uses is moving through the story chronologically so to help the reader feel as if they are not lost between time zones.<br /><br />Sure, everyone you speak to who has read the book will say something like \\"an exhilarating flight into fear, love, beauty and fiery death ... magnificent (said by the People),\\" or \\"It's magic ... the best book I have read in the last ten years (said by the Chicago Tribune).\\" Truth is I will say the same as them. This book was exciting and breathtaking. It felt as if one was in the plane along side with pilot, watching his every move and biting their lips away in fear that the pilot may die in any second and Wolfe would remove the character out of his novel. But, I advise that you DO NOT read this book if you are a reader who likes spending their time on romantic novels or light reads with clear humor. Although, this is so, if you are willing to spend time to understand the complexities and the beauty that Wolfe has written about, I assure you that you will not regret the experience or the roller coaster ride that comes along with this book.

B004IZMQI2|4.0|I have to say I almost chose not to write this considering how many existing reviews there are on this book.  I did really enjoy it and out of a certain kind of love felt compelled to. Steven Pressfield would say that is a good thing for me, you, and the earth.<br /><br />I thought the first half was much better than the second.  Steven does a great job defining resistance and it's tools of self-sabotage (procrastination, fear, rationalization..).<br /><br />Reading this book, you quickly get sucked in. It is hard not to feel those emotional twinges as you read about the many faces of your lower brain functions; your resistant mind, and where it dwells; your ego.<br /><br />Being filled in on the many ways resistance discourages us from pursuing what we are meant to be is eye opening.  I challenge anyone to read this book and tell me they cannot relate to most of Steven's definitions of what resistance is.  It's a scary thing, and the first step in defeating it, or at least fending it off as it never goes away, is understand what it is, what it does, and why. That is something Steven Pressfield does to a very high caliber.<br /><br />I have some difficulties when the book goes the religious direction.  I know a lot of people could argue saying they are not directly religious propositions, but metaphors of a deeper meaning to things, even your own mind. The point i take is that a person must accept there are parts of your own mind that you don't fully understand or grasp that speaks to you in a different way that you can never control, as it lives and operates differently. That or there is a divine Muse, God, or some incorporeal beings that enjoy creating time via our physical beings for no other reason than love.<br /><br />Whatever your take on that last part it, this book is eye opening and inspirational. It will help you understand that part of yourself that keeps you from being a success, that prevents you from being who you should be, from following your dreams..
B002MQYOFW|4.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" takes place in a modern version of George Orwell's world of [[ASIN:B003JTHWKU Nineteen Eighty-four]], with future technologies and a very creative design of a political system.  The book places more focus on the effects of such a world on the relationships between the \\"proles\\" or oppressed class.  Hollywood seems to have only extracted the love triangle aspect from the story, which is a pity - Collins' point seemed to be much larger than that.  I recommend reading the first book, which is a complete story of its own.  If you continue to the second book in the trilogy, you'll have to read the third.

0439023513|5.0|I was a little worried starting in to this book due to the lower star rating and warning from others that the third book wasn't well received.  So this review (which I rarely write) is for people who are in a similar place.  Don't hesitate to buy this book. It is as much of a page turner as the previous two.  It breaks from the format of the first two because this time the Hunger Games are for all the marbles.  This shows more of the reality of the mental degradation that war causes people.  They are forever damaged, yet they still live on trying to find purpose.  This is pretty much the only way the series could end...it makes the most sense even if it isn't particularly happy.  So please read it.  Even if it isn't what you wanted, the series as a whole is amazing and the most fun I have had reading in a long time.

B003X5UFWW|5.0|Wow Ip Man! Wow Donny Yen! Wow Mandarin Films!  I have seen this Title on Amazon and on a few retail shelves, but you know how it is with a movie you're not sure of.  I like a good Martial Arts movie, emphasis on GOOD. Found out my A-Prime includes Instant Video and thought I would give 'Ip Man' a shot.  Hollywood can say what they want, Mandarin Films and Donny Yen absolutely blew me away!  The Production Quality is excellent, yet the film is able to create that \\"Old Time Sunday Afternoon Kung Fu Theater\\" feel, minus the cheese.  Sure there is some added drama to the historical record, but the philosophy of Ip Man and Wing Cun is very much in tact. Donny Yen's technique is outstanding, and the fight scenes are not too over the top or lengthy. (That.. IS Wing Chun)  This film shows the hardships and struggles that we must face and the importance of staying grounded while working through things.  Try to stay good to our fellow man in spite of the situation you may find them or yourself in.  Hardcore Martial Arts (especially Kung Fu) fans should love this picture.  A great Action Film with some historical value and a good message for those looking for an evening's entertainment as well.  Quite Honestly this could be one of the best Martial Arts based movies I have seen. For true Wing Chun Kung Fu - WOW!  I can't wait to see it with just English subtitles. I'm sure it will add way more feel to this great movie.

Along with delivering an enjoyable, fast paced espionagy kind of story, the author paints a true-to-life picture of the expat experience. All of the stresses, goofy social situations, and minor marital difficulties are right on.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all times. I challenge you to get it and watch it as a family - it will change your life. It is great that Sherwood Baptist Church is reaching out and spreading the love of God through these movies. To make us better fathers, but most of all better Christians and examples for our children. The family is the core of America and we need that reminder. I also think that it is great to have a movie like this be the number one at the box office when it is released and then the number one in sales as a dvd. We serve an awesome God that loves us and is always with us no matter what- we just have to have the faith. This movie will touch your life like never before - I promise it will make a difference in your life. Have a Jesus filled day.

0143118706|1.0|I assume that the hardcover version I just read is the same as the paperback.  I absolutely loved reading EPL but was very disappointed by Committed.  I finished the book feeling exhausted and tense by her examination, re-examination, questioning, re-questioning, interviewing - family, friends, strangers, and in general spinning her wheels in a tizzy about marriage.  There is a good amount of bitterness about her divorce interspersed, which I thought she was finished dealing with in EPL.  I was half expecting \\"Felipe\\" to have enough of her obsessive compulsive and egocentric behavior and walk out by the end; clearly this man has the patience of Job.  Heed her words in the foreword when she states that she did not write the book for millions of readers, but rather for \\"exactly 27 readers\\" whom she then lists.  I pity these women having to put up with her during the writing of the book.
0385344228|3.0|William Landay's  DEFENDING JACOB has received a lot of hype from its publishers and has been compared to Scott Turows \\"Presumed Innocent\\". Personally, this tale of the fourteen year old son of an Assistant D.A. accused of murdering a classmate put me more in mind of the William March book THE BAD SEED.<br /><br />Several of Landay's characters lack flesh on their bones and the actions of some are downright unbelievable. The Jacob character must be based upon the Sphinx (he is that inscrutable) or perhaps he takes after his father Andy, who has managed to keep a secret from his wife for fourteen years.  The wife,Laurie, seems to want to be the perfect mother and anything less than achieving this perfection means she is a failure and \\"to blame\\" for any of her sons problems.  The actions of the victim as he was being murdered were implausible at best. Jacob's grandparents seem to be MIA(yet another item that was hard to believe). Then we have Andy's \\"friend\\" who is trying the case.  His \\"go for the throat\\" tactics are not the actions of a friend and the political maneuvering in this sticky case is a stomach turning sight to behold. Of course, the story is being related by just one person whose outlook, we know, is skewed.<br /><br />Those observations aside I will admit that this would be the type of selection that any book club group would jump on since it presents any number of avenues to explore and topics for discussion.....and perhaps that was the author's goal.  Some of the questions that came to mind as I read were (1) What lengths would a parent go to in order to protect their child from a murder charge? (2) is there any scientific validity in \\"behavioural genetics\\" - - in other words are certain people born with a \\"murder gene\\" and therefore driven to commit certain crimes and therefore not truly responsible for their actions - - Nature versus nurture? (3) how biased is the media in reporting sensational stories and does their version shape public opinion ? (4) does placing a child in nursery school create children with RAD (reactive attachment disorder)? (5) What is the effect of social media on our society?  While there was some food for thought presented, I am still less than enthusiastic about this book.<br /><br />Final Analysis: The family secrets are over the top on the believability meter, for an intelligent man the father was obtuse when it came to his son, the courtroom drama is less than dramatic, the protagonists recounting of the case is about as exciting as reading a court transcript of a manufacturer being sued for soap that didn't get the laundry clean enough, and a majority of the characters are about a flat as the paper dolls I played with as a child.  All I can say is, Mr. Landay definitely owes a big thank you to his publicist.  2 1/2 stars.ild in nursery school create children with RAD (reactive attachment disorder)?

One cannot help becoming immediately irritated fiancee Inez's friend, a pompous know-it-all British professor - Michael Sheen. (It also reminded my why I thought most, if not all, my liberal arts courses were silly and useless.)<br /><br />Turns out Gil is also bored by Sheen, begs off on an evening with Sheen, goes wandering around Paris, and at midnight is swept up and back into the world of the 1920s.

1451627289|5.0|You don't have to be a big Stephen King fan or a Kennedy Assassination Conspiracy buff to like this book. Despite the fact that it is a \\"time-travel\\" mystery, there is surprisingly little supernatural suspense here. What this book does very well is bring to life the \\"lost\\" America of the late 1950s and early 1960s. A time before cell phones and personal computers. When people would smoke in restaurants and adults had to sneak around in motels when dating. My favorite part of the book is when the main character orders a Root Beer Float after first going back in time. It is made with real ice cream. He makes a great comment about how \\"the past tastes better\\". What a great image. The suspense in this novel builds slowly to a great climax. I highly recommend this book.

As someone who also writes about work and careers, I'm delighted to have a book that I can easily recommend to anyone, regardless of life stage and situation.

Their photo looks like a miniature version of the other Stanley Tripod Flashlights.  The things I got in the mail were cheap stripped down plasticy versions!  Then when I went to try to return the item with \\"Item Isn't What I Ordered\\" they weren't going to issue a refund.  If you try to return it because you're disappointed like I was, use the last reason something like \\"Item Didn't Match What Listed on Webpage\\".  The crappy thing is that I had ordered these for Valentine's gifts for my two boys & had to send them back because they would've broken them within minutes.

B000GG4XHO|5.0|That was part of the description that critic Paul Nelson used for Reed's performance on the song \\"Coney Island Baby\\" the closer to this album. Nelson was one of the greatest folk/rock critics that ever lived. He was pivotal in the careers of Dylan and Springsteen and many others. The whole review is included in the package for this CD and it is a great review. the kind you don't see anymore and never will. Critics don't and can't write that way anymore. The \\"Business\\" and the suits have taken over and most everybody likes it that way. Nelson left in disgust, quit writing about rock and quit listening to it.....no wonder. All you have to do is read some of the so-called professional critics take on LULU and you see what I mean. One even said that LULU is what happens when artists have too much control because it's unlistenable. Idiot.<br /><br />Coney Island Baby was, in my opinion, Reed's first mature album and a masterpiece of the rock era. He was young, he was funny, almost romantic but no sentimental slob. He knew too much of the streets of NYC to fall for that. He was always an outsider, still is. The playing is first rate, crisp and clear. The remastering is almost as good as the original vinyl that I recall. Any Lou Reed fan has to have this in their collection. It's fun and it's real. It was obvious that this recording had a profound affect on one of the greatest bands, Dire Straits, especially Sultans of Swing. You can hear it in Knopfler's vocal and guitar phrasings. It's interesting that Knopfler did the sound track for \\"Last Exit to Brooklyn\\". Selby is one of Reed's greatest influences. And oh yeah, make sure you read Nelson's review inside.

0691142165|4.0|The authors track five kinds of economic crises: external default, internal default, banking crises, exchange rate crises, and inflation crises.  All of these have different metrics, so making the binary decision of when to categorize an event as a crisis is somewhat subjective. A great deal of the book, enough to be rather boring, is dedicated to the justification of their techniques.<br /><br />Once they have established the validity and consistency of their techniques across countries and across time, the next step was to gather data. They claim this to be their greatest contribution, and I believe them. They have collected consistent data longitudinally through time and laterally across countries, 66 in all, representing approximately 99 percent of the world economy. This is a tremendous labor. Among the many difficulties they had to overcome:<br />* Missing data. It was not important at the time to collect the data, and it is hard to reconstruct<br />* Lack of transparency. There are lots of things that governments don't want you to know, especially about their debt.<br />* False categorization. When him and certain types of transactions receive favorable tax treatment, say investment versus operating expenses, a lot gets misreported.<br />* Inconsistent reporting periods, and gaps in the data. They had to do a lot of interpolation to fill in the blanks.<br /><br />Having collected their huge database, the authors perform a vast number of rankings and correlations. They generally find that there is a substantial correlation among different kinds of crises. A banking crisis may lead to a currency crisis.<br /><br />The book is useful because it provides a number of leading indicators for upcoming banking and currency crises. For instance, leading indicators for currency crashes are real exchange rates, the presence of a banking crisis, and the current accounts balance is a fraction of gross domestic product.<br /><br />One truth that comes through is that governments are systematically, serially, always irresponsible. They borrow to spend on wars, grandiose domestic programs, and programs designed to win blocks of voters. They are almost always able at some point to borrow more than they will be able to repay, at which point they have to default.<br /><br />Default take several forms. Argentina simply froze bank accounts, especially dollar accounts, and forced their holders to take devalued Argentine pesos in place of the dollars. The United States performed a de facto default in 1934 when it went off the gold standard. Russia and Ukraine performed de facto defaults when they froze bank accounts and allowed massive inflation during the time in which the citizenry could not get their hands on their money. The constant in all this is that when the government has no money, they have to take it from people who do. What they can get away with it is a political decision.<br /><br />The United States appears to be flirting with default as I write this. We have doubled federal debt since the crisis of 2007/8. We continue to borrow in order to service the debt. We did not have any reasonable prospects for growing our way out of the problem. The question then is, what form will the default take?<br /><br />Who are the creditors? Legions of people who depend on the federal government for their retirement: military veterans, civil servants, and Social Security recipients. Federal bondholders, domestic and foreign. Bank depositors, corporations, mortgage holders and others who are beneficiaries of federal insurance programs. The government will be enforced at some point to decide who they stiff, and how.<br /><br />The only plausible exit that I see is allowing the massive amounts of money pumped into the system by quantitative easing to lead to inflation, and doing away with the cost-of-living clauses in Social Security and other pension programs. Medicare will have to be increasingly means tested, and the payments to doctors made sosmall as to force people to return to fee-for-service if they want an acceptable level of service. I see no other way to tame that monster.<br /><br /> I expect bondholders to suffer the worst. They will be exposed to naked inflation, and ordinary taxes on the illusory income that they get in the form of interest. There will be interesting to see how this plays out, but I will keep my eyes on the financial geniuses of our generation to see how they manage to short T-bills as the crisis looms. Safee.

B0067QPVJ6|2.0|The best I can say about this movie is that I liked it better than the 1951 \\"Thing\\". It strikes me as not so much a bad film as one that tries to be two things at once- in this case a sequel and a remake- and does neither well.  I see the following as particular problems:  1.  The final scenes supposed to tie this film to the 1982 original simply don't make sense, either in relation to the earlier film or the events of this one.  I personally would need another viewing just to sort out who was even still alive.  This is the most obvious indication that the filmmakers would have been better off to drop the prequel pretense and just let it be a \\"remake\\" that could stand on its own.  2.  The sequel v. remake conundrum shows even more in the conception of the creature.  As other reviewers have been pointing out very consistently, the Thing here doesn't act at all like the 1982 Thing.  In the earlier film, the Thing is a model of caution and stealth.  Here, it seems hellbent on eliminating or assimilating everyone as quickly as possible.  As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing wrong with this revisionist take on Thing behavior.  The problem for me is, it just isn't done well.  The speed of the Thing's onslaught doesn't leave much room for tension, never mind character development.  There isn't a sense of the Thing progressively revealing itself, as the first transformation of human to thing is little different from the ones that follow, and we see the \\"original\\" form (by far the most weakly conceived!) at the start.  And, ultimately, this Thing just doesn't seem like an effective fighter.  Like the 1951 creature, it can't seem to come up with a better strategy than rushing straight at a human.  3.  I was disappointed in the use of Mary Winstead. Her character has the potential for a symbol of changing gender roles (the most promising subtext of the 1951 film), and one can at least give this film credit for letting a woman's competence and character speak for itself instead of pushing her into a romance subplot or a heavy-handed feminist manifesto.  But, ultimately, she isn't given that much to do, and at times the story comes perilously close to pushing her into the \\"passive victim\\" stereotype.  I must also say, Winstead herself doesn't convey the same energy or charm that made her stand out in \\"Scott Pilgrim\\".  4.  Finally, I think the helicopter landings in the storyline are significant deviations from the \\"set-up\\".  If anything unifies the original story and the first two films based on it, it is a sense of isolation and claustrophobia.  This film clearly tries to have the same quality, but having helicopters repeatedly coming out of the sky goes a long way toward defeating it.

I am a finan­cial layper­son. Read­ing Niall Ferguson's book, The Ascent of Money, taught me a whole lot about money. Now, I'm no author­ity, but at least I'm slightly more informed about my ignorance.<br /><br />Overview of The Ascent of Money<br />The book is divvied up into six mas­sive chap­ters.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is my all time favorite workout DVD - and believe me I've done a few.  I love that you can follow the beginner or the advanced version of the moves within the workouts.  There is no down time so you are working out the whole time.  As a mother of an infant and a toddler, 30 minutes is all I've got right now to workout.  After I am through with this I feel as if I've actually done something. Currently I'm using Level 2 and Level 1.  I've tried Level 3 but it is hard!  That's another good thing about this DVD - you can pick which level you want to do based on if you want a really challenging workout (3) or if you are just trying to do something and you are dead tired already (1).  Wholeheartedly recommend!  Oh and I don't find Jillian annoying at all - like some instructors on workouts.  I don't get tired of her and after doing this DVD on and off for over a year I still feel motivated.

0783240236|5.0|If you've never seen this movie, you may be inclined to think that the most horrible thing birds could possibly do is to poop on you or your car.<br /><br />A horror movie doesn't get much better than this.  An intelligent script, well acted and a couple of plausible explanations including where your own imagination takes you as to the reason to why the birds are attacking just underscores what is missing in today's horror films.  We have the feeling of isolation of the small town that can only be accessed by boat or driving on the only road into town.  The Birds succeeds in that \\"no where to run\\" feeling as attacks by birds of all kinds wreck havoc on people and property.<br /><br />The tension is as palpable as you'll ever come across.  If you are on heart medication or don't like films that don't tie up endings for you, don't watch this but if you enjoy a perfect horror movie, this is about as good as it gets.

B0059XTUEK|4.0|My Week with Marilyn is based on two books by Colin Clark; one a diary documenting the shoot of The Prince and the Showgirl, the other a memoir of his alleged affair with Marilyn Monroe during that shoot. Even though it has origins in literature, the plot is noticeably lacking. Then again, I suppose My Week with Marilyn was never really about plot. Distributed by the Weinstein Company, this is a film for Harvey Weinstein to provide awards push. It's a slight film, where a strong, complex story takes a backseat to providing roles for talented actors to fill and potentially win Oscars for. That's not to say the making of the film itself or the performances are driven by greed or that any involvement is superficial, just that no one involved was surprised when they were nominated for their work.  This movie boasts several strong performances, but the focus comes down on Michelle Williams as the titular character. I trust Williams as an actress, but I never envisioned her as Monroe. To embody the cosmic force that was Marilyn Monroe is no easy task. Now, I can't envision anyone tackling this role so beautifully. For a brief 99 minutes, Williams is Marilyn Monroe. She embodies her, absorbing all of the characteristics and producing a performance with more dimension than what was initially on the page. It's no secret that Monroe was more troubled and complicated than her onscreen persona, but the film only allows glimpses of her true nature. After all, it takes place during a brief period of time, from the limited perspective of one person who had never met her and would never meet her again. Alas, this is not a Monroe biopic. It's harmless, award-hungry fluff that rises above the material with one of the most convincing transformations into a real person I've seen in some time.  Eddie Redmayne is 23-year-old Colin Clark, whose determination lands him a job as the assistant to Laurence Olivier (played by Kenneth Branagh, a nice touch) on the set of The Prince and the Showgirl. Olivier is directing the film and has cast Monroe, whom he can barely conceal his yearning for. Of course, Olivier was married to Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormond) and Monroe to Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) at the time, but Monroe's affect on men has been well documented. Colin, like anyone in her presence, is drawn to her but is preoccupied with keeping his job and attempting to woo a set girl named Lucy (Emma Watson). With Olivier growing increasingly frustrated with the aloof Monroe, who is busy grappling with her own insecurities, Colin suddenly finds himself befriending Monroe. Romance, to some extent, ensues, but the film is coy about it. Perhaps the book goes into greater detail, but nothing about the story is particularly fascinating or memorable. It's all a backdrop.  To play a real person, an actor does not need to resemble the person they're portraying. Their job is to capture the essence of a person rather than embody their physical characteristics. Branagh and Oliver share only a fleeting resemblance, while Ormond hardly looks like Leigh at all. Meanwhile, Redmayne and Scott look a little closer to their real-life counterparts, but Williams is the whole package. Perhaps this contributes to how much her performance stands out. I'm not knocking Redmayne, Scott, Branagh, or Ormond, but Williams trumps them all and completely inhabits Marilyn Monroe, essence and all. How appropriate, in this context. Monroe embraced the Method approach to acting, while Olivier saw acting as little more than saying the lines convincingly. Branagh says his lines convincingly, but Williams disappears.  In life, Williams doesn't look much like Monroe. Makeup and acting ability apparently go a long way. She magically captures the voice, the charm, the more private aspects, and, of course, the iconic look. When she is onscreen, you forget you're watching Williams. A role like this screams \\"Oscar!\\" but she really brings it to life triumphantly. Her Oscar-nomination is well-deserved and I wouldn't be terribly disappointed if she won. The film does a sufficient job of showing the multiple sides of Monroe's personality, but is restricted from going too in-depth. Neither Williams nor the script is able to paint a complete psychological portrait of Monroe, but both successfully portray the many facets, public and private, of this sex symbol. Williams perfectly balances the mature, yet child-like, flirtatious, innocent quality that Monroe possessed, eternally locked somewhere between cute and sexy. Monroe is presented here as both the person and the ideal, with Williams playing her to perfection without a false note. Redmayne has a likable, boyish charm and it is fun to watch the other actors become Hollywood royalty, but Williams singlehandedly makes the film worth watching.  The direction by Simon Curtis is stagnant, simply because anyone could have directed it and there's nothing dynamic about the way the film is put together. The screenplay is fashioned well, recounting events with very little creative flourish. It just misses the boat on being a great film by playing everything too safe. It's a very standard portrait of a true story that would be solid, yet forgettable without the terrific performances. If the Monroe role had been miscast, the film likely would have been satisfying but would have completely slipped from memory afterwards.  A minor film with major star power, it's neither deep nor astounding but worth admission price for Michelle Williams' performance. She has already demonstrated a wide breadth of talent, but she shows here that she may not have even touched the surface of her own potential. Aside from my praise for Williams, this review may sound harsh despite my intentions.  The major weakness is that it is unapologetic, blatant Oscar-bait and it sticks so close to that particular formula that it lends itself to inferiority. However, blatant Oscar-bait is often better than most films and removing it from this context, My Week with Marilyn stands as a well-made, well-acted film that impresses without surprising. Just like a real-life week with Marilyn would unfold, the film flies by and, like the relationship between Clark and Monroe, there's no middle ground. The film has a beginning and an end, reaching the latter swiftly and almost abruptly. Just like spending a week with Marilyn, she's all that matters during this time...And after.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|This series made me very appreciative of the Kindle Lending Library, because I'm pretty sure this would have been a 2 star review if I actually shelled out money for it.<br /><br />In short: The first book is definitely worth reading. If you've never read Battle Royale or Lord of The Flies, then by all means have at it - you won't be disappointed. Books 2 and 3 get progressively more convoluted and ultimately fail at delivering any kind of emotional ties to conclude the series.<br /><br />That being said - as much as the author claims that this was somehow inspired by Greek mythology - the first book is strongly reminiscent of Koushun Takami's [[ASIN:156931778X Battle Royale]] that was published in 1999. Wait, scratch that - it's almost exactly the same. Strange arena, random weapon selection, updates on who's been killed, alliances, tracked competitors. There's the added flair of reality TV thrown in to appeal to today's audience, but the stories are very very similar. The core difference is that the participants are somewhat trained and willing in Hunger Games versus the kidnapping of the students in Takami's book.<br /><br />When I read Battle Royale, I remember being compelled to find out what happened to the surviving couple at the end. The Hunger Games helps answer a similar sort of question in the 2nd and 3rd books. Apparently the answer is that they go on to lead drab, depressing lives that are expressed in completely boring fashion. This is a shame - because on the surface the subject matter is actually interesting. Post-apocalyptic stories usually are, right? The only problem is that these novels try to become too many things. Is it a political statement on how the Capitol conducts the affairs of its citizens? Is it a love story? Is it an action story? Is it a story of a revolution? Is it the story of one girl vs the world? Certain books can weave multiple story threads and do so masterfully. This is not one of them.<br /><br />To top it off, the protagonist is simply not someone that I found myself rooting for as the stories wore on. I'm not sure how someone that confused and bratty is somehow also a disciplined hunter and a force to be reckoned with in the arena.<br /><br />The list goes on - story elements go unresolved, mundane things are explained in grave detail where things that are actually interesting are left by the wayside for the reader to figure out on their own. A small example - literally dozens of pages are devoted to how Katniss feels bout a particular type of rose, which relates to only one character and doesn't really mean anything ultimately in the grand scheme of the story. On the other hand - if you were wondering how they managed to develop such advanced science when the world is in shambles around them and is the whole reason why the Hunger Games can take place in the fashion that they do... Yeah, that part goes completely unexplained or unquestioned over 3 books.<br /><br />Sad to say -  but, given the above,  these books scream \\"I'm in it for the movie rights\\" from the Page 1.self rooting for as the stories wore on.

B006UG90RM|5.0|VH is back!  I was a worried with Tattoo and closed my eyes when I bought tickets for their upcoming tour months before the show and weeks before  ADKoT was released.  I was hopeful that the tour set list would simply be old Van Halen hits.  Now after listening to the Deluxe Edition end to end several times over, in and out of order, I am simply AMAZED.  It met me every expectation and now I wish for their tour to be almost exclusively new material.  Although some miss Ted and Mikey, I'm happy with Ross and Wolfie.  The production is great and brings back that Van Halen II sound and edge. There is no silly volume maximizing like Bob Rock or Rick Rubin, nor too many tricks on this release; not even a keyboard!  This is really not a pop album, it squarely sits in the hard rock genre and Ross captured that quite well.  It is refreshing to hear the bottom section pronounced and Wolfie comes off as a professional with serious chops.  I'm sure it didn't hurt that dad was okay with the bass tracks coming out a bit more than Mikey's were in the past.  Yes the background vocal melodys are not as sweet and Dave's vocal chords are stretched, but they sound epic and this achievement is absolutely mind blowing for 2012.  I can't wipe the smile on my face when I hear any of the new tracks!  Tattoo is really the weakest tune but the album version is not bad and it is a good opening tune for a crushing album that kills!  My favorites are Honeybabysweetiedoll, As Is, Blood and Fire, China Town, Big River, and Beats Workin'.  Honestly the whole album is classic Van Halen II with polished but edgy production.  Alex is on fire as is Wolfie.  Dave's vocals just force you to rock and sing along with him.  Eddie's solos are predictably amazing and his little noodle flares are evident throughout most of the album.  They do not miss hardly any of their trademarks save the more Hagar era poppy tunes.  I am a fan of the VH catalog (minus III) but DLR and this new iteration of VH hits the 1980's mark dead center!

B0025UHKNS|5.0|I have used this garmin about 5 times now and I really enjoy the instant feedback I get on distance, pace and heart rate. Previously, I used apps on my iPhone to review distance and pace, but I don't think it was as accurate and it was more difficult to check my pace during a run. Last fall was my first half-marathon and I was frequently asking my partner about our distance and pace. I think we'll both be happy that I now have my own garmin and won't have to ask her how we're doing all the time. This garmin will be great for me to work on pacing myself and on speed work. I'm not a great techie, but I have found this to be easy to use and very reliable.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent Bible App. Very easy to use.  Having so many translations , devotionals and Bible reading plans makes Bible study easy.
B0078ZT39Y|2.0|I loved this show.  I own all of the seasons and I'm part of Amazons great season subscription program.  The problem this season is it became too tongue and cheek comedy and the cases have become way too formulaic.  Add to that everyone confesses and no one wants their lawyer.  The show used to walk the fine line between drama and comedy and now it's just very light hearted fun with no real drama or story.  I'm going to keep my subscription for this show going this season, but if it doesn't get better I think I'm done with the show.  Already most of the shows this season left my fiancée and I feeling let down.  It's sad since we were always psyched about watching the new episodes the minute they aired.  Now we just kinda wait until we have nothing to do.  I want the drama back.  I want the dark. I miss the wit. And I want the laugh out loud comedy moments that the show used to have in spades.  Not this season's phoned in half chuckle writing. Its sad to because you see the actors struggling to make the lousy scripts work, but in the end it just comes off cheesy.  And Nathan Fillion needs to hit the gym.  Its kinda weird watching the women on the show swoon for him now.  (edit: I  meant this as a review for the season as a whole, not just this episode.)

0307200477|4.0|Pat the Bunny is a great book for 9 month to 2-3 year old children.  Unfortunately, the binding was the wrong type for a book that will be repeatedly handled by children.  The book came completely unbound before we even gave it to our 1 year old twins.  We put it back together and it immediately came unbound again.  I took it to Kinko's and they rebound it in a more appropriate fashion so that it would withstand lots of loving use.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This application is fantastic with so many choices of Bibles and study reading options. It is not a guided study app, however. There are no questions or thought provoking essays provided, my wife found this as a serious drawback and I wish there was some way to easily find this option, also. No one application can hope to cover the broad expanse of religious belief, this one can provide a way to bring the reader to the door of knowledge.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It was exactly what I needed for those moments in between. Easy and User friendly. I loved thelis game a lot!!
0802473156|1.0|This book is very poorly written. The author makes the so called 5 love languages as if they are the only ones and as if they do not change over time. These love languages are (words of affirmation, quality time, physical touch, acts of service, and gifts). These things change over time, and people tend to search for what is missing in their lives, not a primary love language BS. We put different values for things according to our needs at the moment.  He gives poor examples to make his points. One example in particular, a husband comes to him for a session and he tells him how stupid he was to lose his wife. His wife kept on complaining about her job over and over again, so the husband (like any good husband would do), kept on telling her his best advice to deal with the matters at hand. According to Chapman, she was not looking for advice, she was looking for a quality time!!! Well sorry if someone is stupid to keep on complaining about one issue over and over and wants to take no actions, then he/she should accept status quo. Who wants to listen to a chronic complainer!! And besides; how does that make it a quality time for the husband hearing her complain all the time??  Also, he puts emphasis on jesus and religion. Well not everybody is religious, and the ones that are religious I am sure can go to their local church or find religious books if that is what they are looking for.  The book is full of I. It is such a self promoting book beyond imagination. I did this, and I did that. And the message he want to tell everybody: I am big, I know what I am doing. Go to my seminars, listen to my CDs and buy more of my books.  I wish there was a better scoring system, I would not have given it a zero, I would score it minus 5 stars.  Bottom line, don't waste your money on this book.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|This movie made me angry it was so bad.  It tries very hard to be hipster-deep.  The acting is ok-ish, when there are actually people in it. One of my favorite movies is another polarizing one from this director, so I'm shocked I hated this so much.  I can't believe I spent money to rent this.  All that said, my brother, who I agree with on most movies, LOVED this.  I was shocked!  I only found out after blasting him an email about how horrible and self-indulgent the movie was.  So I can't say for certain whether anyone else would like this or not, but I can't in good conscience give this more than one star.
0525478817|5.0|I realize it's only February, but this is my favorite book of the year. Now is it right to declare it the BEST book of the year before I've read all the future books from now until December 31st? Quite possibly. Why? John Green gutted me with this one. I used to watch my grandmother slice the catch at the lake for dinner. I thought, a) wow, you stink, fish and b) poor fish, I'm sorry you're going to go in my belly and I don't even like you, even while covered in tartar sauce. For me, there is a literary equivalent to that poor fish - when I've read a book that turns me inside out. John made me laugh in one paragraph and cry in the next. I can't tell you how many times I yelled, \\"oh, no!\\" in the book or had to set it down for a few seconds to gather my bearings - or blow my nose - before being able to read the next sentence. I'm pleased the book will be made into the movie and I hope Hollywood does it justice. These kids deserve the best. And, John, you deserve all these five stars and more. lit love to you, sir
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great followup to one of the best android games of all time! Quell reflect will not disappoint fans of the original!
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|When are people going to learn that unless the movie was a sensational blockbuster, you should never make sequels! I'd rather have Elijah Wood voice for the new Spyro from Skylanders (eventhough I hate that version) than to play as a penguin who tap dances to save a colony from being documented by humans or David Attenborough.
B0054YIQLW|5.0|I really looked forward to seeing this film, which I saw in the movies in the eighties. And the five stars is given based on that experience. Alas I was turned down when I was about to have my reunion with the film, as it's restricted to region 1 - and I live in Norway. The regional restrictions make no sense to old programs like this!

0385342063|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has a formula, albeit a winning formula. There's a slightly ditzy seeming heroine and a slightly uptight businessman and they collide and mayhem ensues. With I've Got Your Number, she's produced one of her best, and Poppy is as charming, if not more so, than Becky Bloomwood. When her engagement ring goes missing, Poppy looks everywhere, utterly frantic, and when her phone does too, she thinks she won't be able to survive. Who could in this day and age? She finds one in a bin and what ensues from there as she flirts and frustrates Sam Roxton is classic Kinsella.<br /><br />The repartee between the two of them as they text, email and solve a bit of a mystery is sweet and revealing (the Scrabble scene was my favorite and will make you wish you had a Sam Roxton with you to play board games with), and is contrasted with what's happening between Poppy and her wishy-washy fiance. The banter, especially the texting, between Poppy and Sam is adorable, and Kinsella keeps the theme of digital love alive. Some of the antics they get up to are a bit unrealistic toward the end, and Poppy makes some not-so-wise choices, but I totally didn't mind because they were done in the name of love. Poppy is charming and one of the things I Ioved best about her is that she learns to stand up for herself and Sam helps her do that, showing her that she's good at her job and good at reading people, even if she's not always so good at reading herself. A delicious, delightful page turner that I was sad to see end, even as I raced to the final page.
0307719219|5.0|Lots of history. How Spanish and English colonies turned out rich or poor and why. Then the theories that don't work. Tropics vs. temperate, shape of the land, cultural, laziness, ignorance, religion, random events like Black Plague.  Then there's the factor that governments are more powerful if they keep the people poor and dependant, while the government gets rich. Not by coincidence the method Obama and the democrats are using.  They examine hundreds of countries through history. Some I hadn't been aware were countries, and had to look up on Wikipedia to find out where they were or are, since some no longer exist.  Sections on the `virtuous cycle' and the `vicious cycle'.  Those are that good government that rewards invention, hard work, low taxes, freedom, good behavior, support rule of law (the law rules the rulers), and spread the size of the governing class build positive feedback that gives more freedom and opportunity to improve. Bad government with rule by law (the law rules the ruled over), elitism, oligarchy, high taxes, etc., build negative feedback that always results in less freedom, more and more laws, failures not dropped but increased since they must work if you try harder, tax and spend causes more taxes and spending, smaller and smaller governing class, and less opportunity to improve.  In short a book I very much recommend be mailed to every politician in America.

B00338QENI|4.0|This was interesting to me as I had breast cancer on both sides and to read how Henrietta Lack's cervical cancer cells caused lots of discoveries in the medical/scientific world was amazing! The story is a little bit hard to follow as it moves to present and past a lot and sometimes you feel like you are reading the same thing in a different way. I think if the thought process had been written out a little bit better rather than scattered it would have been a 5 star book. The story itself is pretty amazing though.

B006UG90RM|4.0|After VHIII and all of the is-he, isn't-he crap with DLR's presence in the band, I wasn't expecting much, especially after hearing \\"Tattoo\\", which just didn't kick my ass.  However, after buying the album, I LIKED it immediately, and the more I listen to it, the closer I come to LOVING it.  It's pretty heavy, which is killer, as I prefer VH's heavier tunes (Unchained, Runnin' With the Devil, And the Cradle Will Rock, etc.).  The ONLY reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that DLR is definitely showing his age.  He's pretty much lost his voice, and his persistent reliance on speaking the lyrics, rather than singing them, really bothered me at first.  BUT...as I listen to the album more, that bothers me less and less, and I've begun to hear a bit of range in Roth's vocals that I didn't hear upon first listen.  It's a real testament to the sheer talent he has for entertaining, and the fact that he just draws you in with every spin of the album.  He's never been a GREAT vocalist, but he's always had that tenacity, cynicism, and fun vibe that made him stick out among the sea of hard rock/metal vocalists.  Those qualities still exist on A Different Kind of Truth.  I also miss Michael Anthony's backing vocals a bit, but not enough to really bother me.  Overall, this is a kick-ass return to form that I admittedly didn't expect.  I haven't been able to stop listening to this album since I bought it the day it came out.  If you love DLR-era VH, you MUST get this one...it won't disappoint.
B006UG90RM|5.0|This is classic Van Halen. A great package when you consider the DVD. The CD artwork and hand written lyrics by Roth alone are worth purchasing this.  Everyone in the band sounds great. This is a keeper, and it only gets better the more you listen to it and the louder you play it!

B0058VA2U4|4.0|I've been a huge Anthrax fan since Spreading the Disease, Among the Living, etc., and I've loved some albums, liked some, and been somewhat indifferent toward others.  I honestly wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this album other than a few killer riffs, but this album absolutely rips!!  The riffs in The Giant made me want to be in a pit immediately, The Devil You Know rules (ditto on the riffs), and In the End is epic, combining the Belladonna-era riffs with the Bush-era metalcore (rather than thrash) sound.  I recently saw them live with Testament, and even though I was a bit ripped off (Benante didn't show up due to family issues and Gene Hoglan filled in), Anthrax was still absolutely killer (of course, Hoglan doesn't suck, either).  Caught in a Mosh sounded just as good as it did 20 years ago, and the new stuff kicked my ass live.  I HIGHLY recommend this album.  With all of the new bands coming out claiming to be old-school thrash, it's nice to hear from the masters again.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Wife and I received this game as a Christmas present. We immediately fell in love with playing it as it is a great strategy/thinking game for adults--great for 2-4 players. The pieces are plastic and small so I would not recommend this game for younger kids--as they can easily put it in their mouth, swallow it, choke on it, etc. More of a game for high school students and above. This game test your mind's ability to analyze and think about geometric shapes and figures---great for visual-spatial people. We loved this game so much, we ordered one for a friend of ours and gave it to them as a gift. Would highly recommend to anyone who loves board games!
B001CN2WXM|5.0|Set in the early 1950s, this is a story about the Los Angeles Police Department, organized crime, corruption, and three cops on a collision course.<br /><br />Commanding Officer Lieutenant Dudley remarks that to be a detective in the homicide bureau it is necessary to be willing to 1) Beat a confession out of a suspect you know is guilty, 2) Plant evidence on a suspect you know is guilty, and 3) Shoot a suspect in the back that you know is guilty.<br /><br />With the city police department this tough, how then is it possible for organized crime to exist in Los Angeles?<br /><br />The many subplots keep the viewer engrossed in the overall view of corruption and the ongoing drama.<br /><br />Disc Two features the making of the movie, cast and crew commentaries, and the many interesting commentaries by the joint writers and director.<br /><br />An excellent movie.

B005UKJX4E|5.0|I experienced a masterpiece when I was bathed in images, music and a montage of profound life experiences organized as sensitively and intelligently as a great symphony.  The story of Job with the ultimate represented by the whirlwind seems to be the crux of The Tree of Life.  Our personal tragedies can become the focus of our attention to the exclusion of the vast and profound mystery of creation, which is always there and always awesome.  Life with its intense suffering requires levels of detachment.  That is not the same as numbness.  Suffering is too real to be ignored and would become the source of a pathology if it was.  But how does one balance an open, active and vulnerable participation in a life filled with loss and suffering?  Few films address these essential questions, but fortunately Terrence Malick does in this moving, beautiful, wise  and inspiring film.
B005J29HD0|2.0|Ok, I gave this 2 stars ONLY because of the pressing quality and not for the content, presentation or mix. The sound quality is fantastic and the mono mix is fabulous. I am returning my second copy within two days because of the inconsistency in the pressing on the disc one. It is not totally flat and has at least two or three high points on the disc can that be seen clear to the outer edge when turning on the platter. This is on both of the disc one copies that I have purchased, not disc two. Disc two has slightly the same issue but not enough to affect the playback. I am not sure if Amazon has received a bad lot of pressings, but I am trying one more time to see if I can get a copy without issues. It will play through from beginning to end, but when it reaches the inner groove and automatically rejects, the surface height is so inconsistent that the needle actually scrapes the surface of the disc the way back to the tonearm cradle. This is not an issue with any of my other vinyl. It could be that the thickness of the 180 gram vinyl does not allow for even the slightest irregularities, but I have other 180 gram discs that are fine. All I want to do is listen to this. At least Amazon has a decent return policy. Wish me luck.

B006P0FD4W|3.0|The original Paranormal Activity was one of those wonderful stories of a no-budget project striking it rich.  The inevitable sequel managed to avoid the common \\"bigger is better\\" mentality of most sequels to actually rival, if not surpass its original.  Expectations, then, were understandably high for this third entry in the franchise.  Unfortunately, the \\"rule of three\\" rears its ugly head this time out.  Paranormal Activity 3, while containing some very inventive moments, ultimately represents the typical \\"bare-bones story to hang a bunch of creepy shots on\\" mindset.  If you don't know by now, this entry attempts to give us some backstory on the sisters of the first two films.  Thus, from its inception, the movie has an uphill battle to fight.  If George Lucas has taught us anything, it's that your backstory should always remain just that ... backstory...  not your main plot.  A brief opening segment shows us the sisters just before the tragic events unfold, as they discover a box of VHS tapes from their childhood.  From here we dive into 1988 and a young Katie and Kristi with their mother Julie, and Dennis, her new live-in boyfriend.  The film wastes no time jumping into the \\"bumps in the night\\" sequences that induce Dennis to setup the requisite cameras around the house... his being a wedding videographer serving as the explanation for why he has access to so much equipment, which would have been VERY expensive back in its day.  The movie does not deviate from the formula of alternating nighttime segments with the follow up reactions to watching the footage and the inevitable climax of \\"activity\\" and tragedy.  By now, you know most of what's going to happen, and the film largely relies more on jump scares (many of them cheap fake-outs) than the genuine creepiness of its predecessors (save for one masterful moment involving a babysitter).  The one real innovation this time out is a camera placed on the base of an oscillating fan which slowly pans between the kitchen and living room.  It's pretty incredible how suspenseful a slow, repetitive pan can be, and the two or three sequences that play off this concept are the only real highlights of the film.  From the get go, the film presents its weakest element, and that is lack of sympathetic characters.  The children, while cute, are underdeveloped as characters and not particularly convincing in their acting. The adults, meanwhile, are easily the most cardboard and generic characters to come out of this series.  The few characters from outside the family are not even remotely sketched out enough to generate any interest either.  In the previous films, the segments between the nighttime scenes were slowly giving us some insight into the families and friends ... filling in a little detail without losing sight of the main story.  In this film, we learn nothing about the girls' mother ... why is she single?  Where is the father?  Who is this boyfriend and how has he come into the picture?  We certainly don't expect to focus on any of these things - but some sense that they have an existence outside the elements of the film would go a long way toward humanizing them.  The bulk of the film plays out as expected, and isn't too bad, even if it is growing all too familiar.  However, a late in the film relocation of the action seems to completely destroy any momentum, and the finale suffers for it.  In the end, we haven't really learned much about the background of the girls that we didn't already know from the snippets of conversation in the previous two films.  Sadly, one of the chief mysteries, that of the half-burned polaroid from the first film, remains unresolved ... leaving room, I suppose, for another prequel.  Now, if I may vent for a moment... the problem with trotting a one-trick pony out too many times is that the flaws start to become harder to put out of your mind.  Chief among them being that which is the bane of any mock-umentary, and that is the increasing unlikelihoodthat characters facing an immediate threat to their lives would continue to film their demise from a shoulder mounted camera.  In key moments, rather than being terrified at how Dennis might escape the menace that is barreling down on him and the young girls, I found myself wondering why he doesn't drop the camera and bolt out the door.  Add to this the illogic that we have a man who hears noises coming from a kids bedroom storage closet, and then promptly sets up a camera that DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CLOSET IN THE SHOT!  Rather, he is focused on the girls' beds.  Even after Kristi has a conversation with \\"something\\" in the closet which is just off camera, still Dennis does not think to re-orient the camera to the closet door.  Likewise mind-boggling is setting up a camera in the living room, where nothing has been happening at all!  Again, we know these are cheats for the sake of the audience, and when the idea was fresh in the first two movies, we simply overlooked them - but when the story becomes so threadbare as to no longer engage our minds, we can't help but go there.  And the film goes beyond that - it is littered with scenes that would send any real life person running out the door, yet somehow we are asked to accept that after a girl is lifted in the air by her hair in her bedroom, that very night she will still sleep in the same room.  When Julie is fed up with Dennis' cameras, she shouts at him ... \\"this ends TOMORROW!\\"  I laughed to myself ... \\"Tomorrow!?\\"  Wouldn't a seriously pissed off person say it ends NOW!?  But of course, that would mean the movie is over!  Even after relocating to her mother's house, Dennis still sets up the camera in their bedroom ... \\"How much longer are you going to videotape?\\" Julie asks. Dennis answers, in a serious example of how little the producers cared about scripting, \\"Until this is all over, I guess.\\"  Bam, done ... there's a camera set up in their bedroom, accept it!  The official trailer was apparently packed with scenes that do not exist in the final film, neither the theatrical nor the director's cut.  I suppose this was a ploy to keep audiences from being able to predict the scares of the movie - but I couldn't help but feel that the movie I had EXPECTED to see from the trailer might have been a much better movie than what we actually got.  In short, while I was entertained by it, after the fact I felt the film wasted its potential to really delve into the girls and their story, and instead delivered us the inevitable formula approach - \\"just turn out the lights and make things suddenly move and get loud.\\"  At this point, the series has really tapped out its potential, and its time to move on to other things.  But, when a studio smells cash, well, you know what happens...

B0060AY6FO|2.0|An intriguing idea by an esteemed mystery writer that runs horribly amok. James set a high bar with wrapping a mystery around an homage to Austen - which she acknowledges in her intro. After all, where do you go with a sequel to Pride and Prejudice unless you want to dispel the notion of finding happiness with a marriage match? The characters are flat as a board, the plot gets bogged down in James' detailed interest and research in historic British court systems, and I had to bribe myself to stick through to the end.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this app is the best it lasted for days great please. only if i could or you could see the look on your face it would amaze you

B006PHD0RW|5.0|I got this game because it was the free app of the day. As most of you probably know, the free games are usually sub-par; well, that is not the case here. I spent countless hours playing this game immediately after purchasing it. This game is highly addictive and I believe it may be the best game I have thus far for my Kindle Fire. This game is suitable for young and old alike. This game will provide you with classic puzzle action with a healthy new twist.  I HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone. Even if you do not manage to get it while it is still free, it would definitely be worth the 99 cent investment. You wont be disappointed.

B00338QELU|2.0|Henning Mankell has been one of my most recommended authors, based on my absolute love of the Kurt Wallander stories. I was heartbroken and depressed when Mankell killed Kurt Wallander off.  The Man From Beijing was my first attempt at reading Henning Mankell outside of the Wallander series, and it will probably be my last. I found it so hard to keep the central plot in focus among the many detours that I actually lost interest in the book a couple of times and set it aside for a week or so.  The voice of Henning Mankell that I love from the Wallander books was not recognizable to me.  Maybe it was the translation, but I didn't find his love of any of the characters in evidence.  Consequently, they were impossible for me to love, or hate.  I hope Henning Mankell finds his lost passion for characters and plot in future books. I don't think I will be looking for it in any more of his writing, unless someone convinces me otherwise.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|For the price and what I purchased this little machine to do, it does exactly what it's supposed to.  I wasn't looking for the most amazing sound reproduced from 30+ yr old cassette tapes, I just wanted to preserve what could have been gone forever.  It's easy to use, if you're willing to learn by playing with it a bit.  When I ran into problems after one use, I was able to email tech help and he was most patient and helpful, guess what, the problem turned out to be ME, not the machine AT ALL. Customer service in this case, is exemplary.  I would recommend this product to anyone who simply wants to 'get it done' without expecting lots of bells and whistles.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I expected this book to be amazing since everyone was going crazy about it, but after reading it, it wasn't THAT great. i didn't really feel as though there was a crazy twist anywhere, but the plot itself is interesting. for a children's book/fun read, i'd give it a 5/5stars.

1844487172|5.0|\\"Roses\\" by Di Van Niekerk is the most beautiful book I've held. Even the feel of the dust jacket is wonderful; the photographs in the book are not only instructive but aesthetically satisfying to browse through and the instructions are efficient and easy to follow.  I have a whole new hobby now and an excellent reference book for my general embroidery.  I highly recommend this wonderful book.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|What is there to say about Adele that hasn't already been said?  I had heard a song or two on the radio from time to time, but other than acknowledging the the power of the song in my head, I didn't give it much more thought than that.  I really just \\"discovered\\" her right before the Grammys and now I am a devotee.  Love this album!  Love this woman!

B006W0QOF2|1.0|I have never offered a review for a movie on Amazon or any other place. I felt compelled to for those of you who are hoping to gather around the tube and watch a good, family-friendly action movie. If you're someone who prefers not polluting your mind (and mind's eye) with perhaps the goriest killing scenes ever produced, do not watch this movie. My wife and I picked this because the previews made it look like an innocent enough action movie about a guy who drives for a living and gets mixed up in something that would lead to an action-packed save the day plot. Instead, we're confronted with pointless filth from start to finish. Feel like we were mislead on this one. This is one of the darkest movies I can remember seeing. Frankly, if you like watching people's heads blown off, stomped off with a boot, etc. this is the movie for you. If you're repelled by that kind of thing do not watch it. I feel like I need to take a bath after watching this. What a waste of time.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game reminds me of my daughters favorite cartoon, Curious George. I've always wanted to be a bagger. Each level is different and require more skill.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I love Mr. Tony Bennett and the singers we did duets with were outstanding. Great CD! I love all the duets but my favorite is the duet with Amy Winehouse and Mr. Tony Bennett.
B006UG90RM|1.0|This band is the most overrated excuse for music I have ever listened to. The lead singer sounds like a drunken lounge singer, and the guitarist sounds like he is choking a dying cat, loosening his hands every few seconds to let it live. The only good album this band ever made was Van Halen III. \\"How Many Say I\\" was pure genius. But of course, bad bands can't end with something good, oh no.<br /><br />The music is just bad, really bad. They sing about tattoos and Wendy's Frostys, but where's the soul? It doesn't make me cry and question life like Nickelback's \\"How We Stand Together\\" does. I'd rather listen to two hyenas mating than listen to this garbage again. If you want a good rock album that's recent, check out Nickelback's \\"Here and Now.\\"
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a very fun game and it works very well on my Kindle. I would definitely recommend.  The best part is that it is FREE.
B0033TJATW|4.0|I am a huge MJ fan, and after his death was completely devasted! But i knew that Michaels music and legacy would live on. Moonwalker was one of my all time favorites as a kid. I remember telling my sister, that Katie was the luckiest girl in the world and i wanted to be her for those moments in the film with MJ. I was a little dissappointed that this dvd version decided to \\"censor\\" a little scene, which i loved from the original. In the original Joe Pesci has the little girl by her hair, grabs a syringe and tells Mike \\"I only want to get poeple high\\", which then follows Mikes all to sweet response \\"do it and your dead\\"... this scene was cut!! I couldn't believe it, i thought that was a great scene it showed him defending Katie. i assumed it was to censor the drug reference and showing the syringe... i don't know but to be honest that was my only disappointment. Nevertheless I love this movie and show it to my kids who have in turn fallen in love with Michael as i have years ago... which shows that his music goes beyond his years... and will live on forever!  RIP MJ!!!
B003H9M1QM|5.0|I've owned a Blu-Ray player for several years now, but hadn't gotten around to re-buying any of our Disney movies on Blu-Ray disc. I got this one as a gift for my wife, and we were both blown away by how it looks and sounds in the new format. The video mastering is phenomenal, and Dumbo looks better than ever. The audio (at least through a 7.1 surround system) is fantastic and lively. Very happy with this purchase.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Typing this on my Kindle, so my review is brief. Incredible read! Best series I have read since perhaps Lord of the Rings. Highly original plot;<br />glad I bought the Omnibus edition because I just could not stop reading. Most books I delete before I reach the end as poor grammar and &#34;typo's&#34; make me incredibly grumpy. No worries with this one, it is worthy of being in my permanent collection of fantastic reads!

0060855924|3.0|Back when I was a teenager and first dipping my toes into writing fantasy fiction, one of my regular characters was a bumbling wizard that constantly broke the fourth wall. I hadn't known at the time that I was essentially doing a rough-hewn Terry Pratchett impression; in fact, at that point I'm pretty sure the only humorous fantasy I had read was a book somewhere in the middle of Piers Anthony's Xanth series. I read Pratchett's Soul Music not long after creating that character, and realized even then that I had found something that would amplify and resonate my still-developing sense of humor. At last, here was a book that had everything I wanted from humorous fiction: a fantasy setting, plenty of magic, random absurdity, armloads of meta-humor, and a smirking disregard for the fourth wall. Also, unlike Anthony's books, it didn't leave me with the lingering urge to take a shower.  The slapstick aesthetic of the Discworld books (at least, the ones I've read) make them a little hard to follow. I've always wanted to try them from the beginning to see if things feel a bit more concrete that way, but now that I've read the first book, I have to say that it didn't really help. In fact, this book hopped around so much that I was past the halfway mark by the time I got oriented and comfortable with the material. The Color of Magic is ostensibly a tale of the hapless wizard Rincewind, a naïve tourist named Twoflower that finds excitement in the most dangerous places, and a mysterious, ambulatory, and sapient piece of luggage, which follows them whereever they go and causes no end of trouble. In actuality, the book is a collection of four bizarre vignettes that are tied together by a whirlwind tour of Discworld's odd cosmology, which is loaded with delightfully silly words and concepts, and often seems made up on the spot. The book is essentially a starting point for Rincewind, and an introduction to the Discworld universe, without much in the way of an actual story. It's best described as a few zany episodes, capped off by a cliffhanger ending.  As such, it must be said that this is a bit of a niche read. It's not for everyone. Enjoyment of this book hinges upon having an appreciation for wordplay, British humor, and fantasy clichés. Also, one can't be too attached to the traditional ideas of character and story structure, or at least be open to the idea of deconstructing and satirizing them. That being said, I had a great time with this book once I adjusted my expectations. It was lighthearted and genuinely funny (in a shake-your-head-and-grin way, rather than a laugh-out-loud way), without being patronizing or one-note. The random locales and situations are hilariously inventive, and there are patterns of consistency throughout that effectively create a sense of setting and highlight what are sure to be future plot threads. While I suspect the quality of the later Discworld is much better, comparitively speaking, this is still a great read for anyone who wants to get away from the self-importance of most fantasy fiction and indulge in a little silliness.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie portrays autism at its rawest form.  This is a perfect movie to help a person who is not familiar with autism to understand this spreading epidemic.  My daughter has autism and it was even enlightening to me to watch this movie to understand more of her thought process etc.  I bought it to show all my friends and family so they would feel more comfortable and knowledgeable when the topic of Autism is brought up. Claire Danes is remarkable in this movie!  A++++++++ Movie
B004SBX112|3.0|Most of the levels are great, but some of them are so difficult I feel like uninstalling every Angry Birds game I have. Christmas Greedings is so difficult, you'll be sweating just to get a one star. Games are supposed to be fun, not difficult!
B002MXA7TC|4.0|Bought this album mostly for Sweet Disposition. The band and Dougy have a wonderful, unique sound. Really like Love Lost and Rest (all making use of Dougy's amazing falsetto). The rest of it is not as fun to listen to, but still solid and atmospheric. Curious as to how the next album will do.
B003Y5HWMW|4.0|I read the book first and it was amazing! The show was good but of course, compared to the book its lacking and every episode my bf was asking my questions about what was going on or who who was because the show didn't really explain very well. Its a great story and has a great storyline but I wouldn't recommend it for any young kids. 1 more naked scene and it would have to rated XXX for a porn.

B002FOQXZK|5.0|Brian Hauenstein  2/14/11  Per: 1  Kid Cudi, Man on the Moon: End of Day   Kid Cudi an indie rapper new to the game straight out of Cleveland, Ohio spit out one of the most innovative and daring hip/hop albums in a long time; \\"The Man on the Moon: End of Day\\".  Cudi displays an old school flow with emo-like lyrics and beats, something never seen or tried in the game before.  Electronic drum beats combined with mystical synthesizers give Cudi a very unique sound that could be considered his own genre. His thoughts straight from his heart are not hard to find, with all his deepest fears and emotions on display: his father died, he can't be accepted in society and he has drug problems with shrooms, molly, weed and probably more.   \\"Man on the Moon: The End of Day\\" is the first album of what Cudi calls \\"the first album trilogy ever\\", telling the story of his life throughout each of them so they can be listened back to back to back.  The album is broken into five different acts narrated by iconic rapper Common throughout. In \\"Act I: The End of Day\\" contains three songs, \\"In my Dreams (Cudder Anthem)\\", \\"Soundtrack 2 my Life\\" and \\"Simple As\\".  \\"Soundtrack 2 My Life\\", is probably the best song on the album depending on who you talk to. In it we find out that Cudi is a very depressed and messed up dude.  He admits to uses alcohol and drugs to deal with problems and says \\"Since my father died, I ain't been right since\\".   \\"Act II: Rise of the Night Terrors\\" is comprised of the song \\"Solo Dolo\\", \\"Heart of a Lion\\" and \\"My World\\". This act is all about Cudi struggles with being an outcast and lonely and what he does to try to get past it. In \\"Solo Dolo\\" Cudi raps about himself always being alone and never fitting in. Solo Dolo is one of Cudi's nicknames that he gave himself and in the song he says \\"Why must it feel so right when i know that its wrong, its wrong. When will I ever learn from the words in my songs. I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo\\". He has struggles being different but is tryingto cope with it and accept it.   \\"Act III: Taking a Trip\\" is about exactly what it sounds like, his drug experience and how he used them to deal with his emotional issue. It is made up of the his hit single \\"Day `N' Nite\\", \\"Sky Might Fall\\" and \\"Enter Galactic\\".  \\"Day `N' Nite\\" was Cudis first single and really gave everyone who listened to it an idea of who Cudi is. He is a lonely stoner that has lots of problems, but when he smokes weed (usually by himself) all those problems and worries are lifted away and he finds himself in a new happy world.   Act IV \\"Struck\\", contains the song \\"Alive (feat Ratatat)\\", \\"CuDi Zone\\", \\"Make Her Say (feat. Common and Kanye West\\" and \\"Pursuit of Happiness (feat. MGMT and Ratatat)\\".  In this act Cudi moves from being all depressed about who he his to finding the happiness inside himself and being happy with all the things around him. In the second best song on the this album \\"Pursuit of Happiness\\", Cudi talks about, you guessed it, all the steps he had made to get passes all his obstacles for the overall goal of finally being happy. Ratatat makes an appearance in this song and really gives the album an even more unique look, with real instruments such as guitars being used to simulate an electronic synth.   The finals Act, Act V \\"A New Beginning\\", Cudi has made it to the point of happiness.  It features the songs \\"Hyyer (feat. Chip Da Rip)\\" and \\"Up Up and Away\\".  Both songs have a uplifting happy beat along with lyrics of hope and happiness.  \\"Up Up and Away\\" is about him lifting away from his problems and moving on to bigger and better things.   \\"Man on the Moon: The End of Day\\" changed the game of hip/hop. The story of Mr. Solo Dolo is magnificent and what Cudi has gone through in his life is amazing.  Listen to this album, listen to someone changing the game unlike anyone has before; the greatest innovation in hip/hop since N.W.A took over in 1988.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Though I've had it longer, I'm still rooted 'bout 1/2 way through 'The Big Short'; not so, 'Moneyball'.  Lewis lofted the ball out of the stadium with one swing of the pen. If you ever wished you took a  philosophy course N college but didn't, read 'Moneyball'. All the philosophy you need N one enjoyable  read. I've always thought, but been afraid to voice the intuitive notion I harbor that there exists a  collegial affection between these two, seemingly disparate, specialties.    Regarding 'The Big Short', I think I need a picture-book 4 neophytes to give me both a conceptual  and a perceptual feel viz a viz the subject of financial instruments. Oddly enough, I think I almost grasped  the concept of the 'derivative' when I read 'Moneyball'.   gunnerThrax

B003Y3MYYU|5.0|It's a fact that there are over thirty Ring recordings available in the Classical Market. Each recording is at least greatly different from each other. Solti focuses on the drama of the Ring's overall plot, which makes his recording very explosive and bombastic. Karajan focuses on the beauty of the music: it's a very heavenly experience, but the tension and power of the Ring are taken right out of the framework. Goodall's live recording is sung in English and the pacing is VERY slow, but the small details can be heard loud and clear. Levine isn't as slow as Goodall, but his singers don't add much to his recording, though the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra is superior to many other orchestras. Janowski's reading may sound a bit too neutral to some, but his complete faithfulness to the score is one of the highlights to his recording (it's excellent for beginners). Every Ring recording in general has its ups and downs. Here, we have Karl Bohm, and this is one of the ultimate Ring recordings of all time.<br /><br />As a live recording from the late 60's, I wouldn't call this a delicious treat. It's more like a gigantic, scrumptious feast for the ears. Bohm gives the Ring the red-hot treatment. The sheer intensity and horrifying drama that he brings to the work is a classic example of his musical genius. His tempi are some of the quickest: the entire recording is about 30 minutes shorter than the average running time. Some of the calmer and more lyrical sections are taken at a fast pace, and admittedly the soothing beauty is lost. It is evident in scenes such as when Erda confronts Wotan in Rheingold, or during the orchestral transitions in Gotterdammerung. However, most of the time they still don't seem rushed at all, and they can be classified as minor complaints. Other tempos are just right: for example, when Fricka criticizes Wotan and his plan involving the Walsung siblings, or when young Siegfried confronts Fafner in dragon form. Bohm manages to make the entire Ring Cycle a completely exhilarating experience, and he never gives in to tedium by adding lack of tension (like Karajan) or slow tempi (like Levine and Goodall).<br /><br />The ultimate Wagnerian orchestra, Bayreuth Festival, gives it their all. Even though they're not as refined as Levine's Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, they are still able to fulfill the conductor's vision. The brass both high and low are the most powerful, while the woodwinds sound delicate enough. The strings are muffled only a few times and the woodwinds during the \\"Forest Murmurs\\" could've been improved with a clearer performance, otherwise the eighteen anvils are perfectly loud and clear. Bayreuth simply eclipses Metropolitan Opera when it comes to the amount of vigor and nervousness that's been added here. Overall, this orchestra in general is the liveliest out of all.<br /><br />The singers are also near ideal. Theo Adam is a marvel. While he is not as equally impressive as Hans Hotter (featured in Krauss, Keilberth, Knappertsbusch, and Solti recordings), he can certainly conjure up everlasting emotions. He sounds more of a genuine Norse god to me, and his ruggedness is what makes his Wotan unique. Plus, he's been a Wotan for a very long time, and so this recording was made when he was probably at the peak of his expertise.<br /><br />Birgit Nilsson is one the best Brunnhildes on the market. She doesn't sound like she was past her prime; she has that edginess that Ann Evans (Barenboim) and Eva Marton (Haitink) don't seem to grasp. Her Valkyrie cry is delightful, and one would probably faint in awe when she sings in the final act of Gotterdammerung. James King and Leonie Rysanek are simply divine as Siegmund and Sieglinde. Every scene they're in makes the Ring more magical than it seems. Just listen to Walkure Act One Scene Three, and Act Two Scene Three: they don't sing them like they used to. Wolfgang Windgassen may very well be the best Siegfried for the ages. Sure, we have Siegfried Jerusalem(Haitink, Barenboim, and live Levine) and Rene Kollo (Janowski) in the present day; they're equally stunning, but no one can compete with the late Windgassen. The scene in which he forges Nothung the sword is defiantly inspiring, and he has certainly improved over the last years (In the Krauss's own Bayreuth recording, the tenor makes tons of mistakes in this scene, but it doesn't overpower the rest of the recording). His last scene in Gotterdammerung is celestial and overwhelming. I sure wish I could've seen him live if I lived in the 50's and 60's.<br /><br />Gustav Niedlinger as Alberich has a vocal heaviness that overwhelms a few other baritones. When he sings his only sequence in Gotterdammerung Act Two Scene One, his emotion is so pure that his son Hagen would've drowned himself in tears (Too melodramatic? Sorry about that.). The only problem is that his character sounds too one-dimensional. Alberich isn't just some cardboard-cutout bad guy. He has a very good reason why he wants to take revenge on the world. Nimsgern (Janowski) and Hammond-Stroud (Goodall) seemed to have understood it very well. Overall, Niedlinger is amazing throughout Wagner's Ring (He deserves many awards for the scene in which he places a curse on the ring after it is obtained by Wotan). Erwin Wohlfahrt is my second favorite Mime, after Peter Schreier. He gives a first-rate performance in Siegfried Act One, but loses some of his edge in Act Two. He is an exceptional Mime nonetheless (Look for him in Karajan's Rheingold, also). And finally, Why the heck would the conductor have Windgassen play both Siegfried AND Loge? The demi-god needs to sound different from a son of a Walsung. Zednik (Haitink and Boulez) and Schreier (Janowski) are much better for the eccentricities that they display through their singing voices. All in all, a Loge that's marred by lack of cunning.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast does an extraordinary job here. Josef Greindl as Hagen is absolutely stunning, though I prefer Matti Salminen (Janowski, Levine, and Sawallisch). Annelies Burmeister as Fricka is pretty easy on the ears, and you can tell that she gets into character almost perfectly. Colossal are the voices of Talvela and Bohme as Fasolt and Fafner; they sing without hesitation, but I wonder if they had any trouble with their costumes. Koth as the delicate Forest Bird isn't as great as Battle (Levine), but it's no fatal mistake; she's almost divine. The Valkyries are some of the most powerful here, the Vassals sing majestically, and the Rheinmaidens play their parts very well.<br /><br />This Ring is essential for its pure energy, its fast tempi, and for its splendid vocal ensemble. I love it.<br /><br />NOTE: This re-release of Bohm's Ring by Decca does not include the libretto. If you would like to obtain one, you can buy Stewart Spencer's critically acclaimed English translation here: [[ASIN:0500281947 Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung]]<br /><br />Grade: 9.7 out of 10(Haitink, Barenboim, and live Levine) and Rene Kollo (Janowski) in the present day; they're equally stunning, but no one can compete with the late Windgassen.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|This is an initial review based on having received the watch last night, charged it overnight and then used it for a run today.  So far it has been great and I'm glad I ignored the negative reviews and read the responses that were in the postive reviews. The bezzel is a bit awkward to get used to but, as a number of the positive reviews on here have noted, all I had to do was get it set up and then I hit the start button and ignored it until my run was done and I hit stop. I was able to glance fairly easily at the display and see my pace and distance and the watch, while big, didn't feel like too much of a distraction.  The upload to the Garmin site was fairly easy and it is really nice to see your route laid over the sattelite images. We have friends with the 350 who have taken it on vacation and have used that feature to track where they go in new cities so that you can plan out the next day where to go which is another great use besides just tracking miles.  At time of purchase there was a great sale going on so the 405CX was actually less than the 305 models. So far I am very glad to have ignored the negative reviews on here and that I read through the positive ones to see that they really do address most of the negative points people raise. Spend 5-10 minutes with the user manual and you will be well rewarded.
B0000246S6|3.0|In addition to being a great poet, Henrich Heine was a seer:<br /><br />\\"Christianity - and this is its greatest merit - has somewhat mitigated that brutal German love of war, but it could not destroy it. Should that subduing talisman, the cross, be shattered, the frenzied madness of the ancient warriors, that insane Berserk rage of which Nordic bards have spoken and sung so often, will once more burst into flame. This talisman is fragile, and the day will come when it will collapse miserably. Then the ancient stony gods will rise from the forgotten debris and rub the dust of a thousand years from their eyes, and finally Thor with his giant hammer will jump up and smash the Gothic cathedrals . . .Yet, it will come and when you hear a crashing such as never before has been heard in the world's history, then you know that the German thunderbolt has fallen at last. At that uproar the eagles of the air will drop dead, and lions in the remotest deserts of Africa will hide in their royal dens. A play will (one day) be performed in Germany which will make the French Revolution look like an innocent idyll.\\"<br /><br />As Hitler - not even a nominal Catholic - made it clear in his Table Talk (with the likes of Martin Bormann listening on approvingly), once hostilities had been brought to an end with Germany in ascendance, he would join the ranks of Nero, Decius and Diocletian by seeking an endgame with the Churches.<br /><br />This 1941 performance of the Requiem is an indication that the campaign was underway. After all, what is Christianity without its Jewish roots, to say nothing of the preacher-man from Nazareth? It would be an affront to Thomas Bowdler to invoke his name at this point: all references to Judaism in the text (Jerusalem, Zion, David, Sabaoth, and Abraham) are excised and replaced by alternatives which were palatable to the Aryan ear. One listens on mesmerised: what on earth were they thinking? Publius Quinctilius Varus - stay out of those forests and romanise these barbarians!<br /><br />These considerations aside, the performance itself is listenable even with the hiss (which Deutsche Grammophon wisely does not mitigate). One understands why Furtwangler held Kittel in such regard as a choir-master: the chorus and its quartiles are crystal clear throughout - indeed, it brings to mind the fabulous performance of the Requiem by de Burgos from 1967 whose chorus is likewise stellar. Nor is Kittel, conducting-wise, the slowest tortoise in the race: the Requiem Aeternam, Kyrie and Dies Irae move along nicely; one detects drag only in the Confutatis and the lumpy Domine Jesu.<br /><br />Another peculiarity warrants comment: this ain't an elegy for the dead. It's devoid of mournfulness. The close of the Tuba Mirum and the Lachrymosa are ravishingly performed but there's no recognition of irreparable loss: there will be no tears for the fallen in gro&szlig;e Deutschland. The soloists sound Wagnerian in address.<br /><br />The hiss aside, the recording requires tolerance (the soprano dwarfs the Berlin Philharmonic in the opening movement). There are three other works on this disc: the final chorus from the Matthew Passion is soupy; Brahms' In Stiller Nacht is treasurable - but the killer punch comes at the end: a Christkindleins Wiegenlied, sung by the boys of the Thomanerchor Leipzig (1940). It is eerie.<br /><br />Oh yes indeed: a figure clothed in red is coming to town. It ain't Santa.ise these barbarians!<br /><br />These considerations aside, the performance itself is listenable even with the hiss (which Deutsche Grammophon wisely does not mitigate).

B00000DHRZ|5.0|Almost 15 years later, the press still doesn't know what to make of The Offspring's magnum opus. Every now and then it pops up on a magazine's \\"Best Of\\" list, but it will probably never get the critical recognition that it deserves. In a way, it makes sense. The 1990's was a bizarre decade with more in common with the 50's and 60's than it has with the 2000's and 2010's. In that sense, it remains a record that, despite sounding modern, exists out of time.  With the exception of their initial breakthrough with SMASH, The Offspring has always got a bad rap for one reason or another. Being commercially successful immediately casts off any punk or indie credibility. Not only that, no less than one half of their roster (Dexter and Greg K.) could have quit their jobs as musicians at any time and fallen back on a \\"real job\\", given their outstanding academic and professional pedigrees. Finally, there was plenty of pop to go along with the punk and rock on Americana. All these ingredients add up to poison for many of the folks who dole out the street cred.  Dexter summed the record up pretty well in an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle back in 1998: \\"The songs on Americana aren't condemnations, they're short stories about the state of things and what we see going on around us. We want to expose the darker side of our culture. It may look like an episode of Happy Days out there in America, but it feels more like Twin Peaks.\\" I couldn't have put it better myself - this decade was one typified false pretenses and forced smiles.  \\"The truth about the world is that crime does pay,\\" Dexter says in the second half of the mini-suite \\"Have You Ever\\". As Shakespeare said, brevity is the soul of wit. They don't waste a single word (or note) on this record, nor do they pull any punches. The singles are all excellent, highlighted by the tale of America's wasted youth in \\"The Kids Aren't Alright\\". The album tracks may be even better, from the intentional bastardizing of Albert Morris's syrupy \\"Feelings\\" , to the acid-drenched psychedelic odyssey \\"Pay the Man\\".  Despite being (or perhaps because it was) a huge commercial success, AMERICANA remains criminally over-looked as an unflinching concept album painting a mural of America in the 1990's. Despite our country's façade of complacency, life, of course, carried on, and it was as ugly as ever. This is Americana.
145162445X|5.0|Lawrence Krauss communicates remarkable scientific explanations for some of humankind's most profound questions in his book 'A Universe From Nothing'.  Dr. Krauss has clear explanations of scientific thinking, told with occasional humor, and developed in an engaging narrative.  I found this very helpful in making this book a fascinating read.  I appreciate how Dr. Krauss communicates the sense of wonder in describing how even the very concept of NOTHING has been changed through discovery in science.  The book served as a brilliant lamp for me and reminded me how science continuously illuminates new understandings of the world and ourselves.  Dr. Krauss' book gives insights into the origins of the Universe, and how the entire Universe can be understood in a new way.  The book offered me the chance to reflect on some big questions ... `Did the universe have a beginning?'... `How did everything begin?'... `What is nothing?'  The reader doesn't necessarily need a lot of background in science to enjoy the book.  I think Dr. Krauss' book will open the door for many to have a much deeper curiosity, leaving them wanting to explore more.  I highly recommend `A Universe From Nothing'.
B006UG90RM|5.0|If you were a fan of VH early days, then there's absolutely no reason you wouldn't love this.  It's been said these songs are re-worked demos from way back when.  If so, who cares.  They've captured the energy and brilliant craftmanship of yesteryear.  Eddie's guitar work has never been better, and Roth's voice has held up reasonably well.  This is a terrific rock album.  Glad I bought it!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I have seen three different versions of Persuasion in DVD: the BBC one dated 1971 and very theatrical, the one dated 1995 with Amanda Root and Ciarán Hinds and the late Corin Redgrave and finally the one from 2007 with Sally Hawkins and the gorgeous Rupert Penry-Jones.  The one from 1971 does follow Jane Austen book Persuasion very well, but it can become a little boring and because it is a very theatrical version, the actors are not as attractive as in the other versions, plus they have a terrible teeth problem (thank God that the young generation of European actors, in general, take better care of their teeth).  The one from 1995 is the one where you see that the actors chosen are perfect for the roles they are playing, starting with Amanda and Ciarán and without forgetting the late Corin Redgrave as Sir Elliot (the best Sir Elliot I have seen), the Elliot sisters, the Musgroves, Lady Russell (the late Susan Fleetwood) and Mrs. Croft. Ciarán plays a more mature and cynical Captain Wentworth than Rupert Penry-Jones in the 2007 version.  About the 2007 all I can say is: Rupert Penry-Jones. The cast is good, especially Sally and Rupert playing a more caring Captain Wentworth, and I'm sure they are playing their characters as the director wants them to play them, but Mary Elliot is unbearable! It is a very free version of the Jane Austen book and although the end is a little crazy, just to see the change on Rupert's face and especially those gorgeous blue eyes when he is asking Sally Hawkins if the rumors of her marrying her cousin are true, is worth the price of buying the DVD. What a face and eyes!  So, if you want to buy a DVD that reflects Jane Austen's book as well as a fantastic cast, buy the 1997 version with Amanda Root and Ciarán Hinds, but if you want a different version with a Captain Wentworth to die for, then buy the 2007 version.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|I ordered this controller despite reading some reviews about the \\"dead zone\\" on the analog sticks, hoping that it wouldn't be too bad. I should have heeded the other reviewers' warning! The dead zone is MUCH worse than I expected. It made it impossible for me to play Skyrim. I really tried to make it work but I couldn't get through even 10 minutes of playing.<br /><br />The dead zone was my main reason for returning the controller, but I also was unhappy with the grips. The ridges are not soft, and I think the smooth plastic of the original controller is much more comfortable than this one.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend this at all. If they fixed the dead zone issue, I would give it 4 stars just because of the ridges on the grips. For now, I'll be sticking with the sony controller.

B003VANOFY|1.0|I purchased this on August 5th, 2011.  Audio was \\"all-right\\" out of the box.  The 7.1 surround didn't work at the time I purchased it, they have since released a driver sometime during the fall/november 2011 time period (years after first manufacture).  Sound improved quite a bit after the driver release.  The microphone doesn't always stop transmission when you swivel it above your head like stated, the red light could be on but still transmit.  After about 6 months, I started having problems getting the headset to turn on and stay on, it would cut off after a few seconds, and the battery life decreased dramatically from 6-8 hours to only 1-2 hours.  After 8 months, the headset comes on for 5 seconds and plays a screeching noise, after troubleshooting, screeching noise gone, headset still refuses to stay on, even when plugged into USB.  Looking at the forums it seems to be a common problem, wish I had done more research before hand.
0545265355|4.0|I wasn't sure I would like this trilogy, but I got drawn into it until I read all three books. Yes, it's about children killing each other but in a way it echoes what's going on in the world today.<br /><br />The stories are set sometime in a dystopian/post-apocalyptic future in a country called Panem, which is located in what used to be North America after it was destroyed by nuclear war. The government leaders in the wealthy Capital rule the surrounding 12 Districts of Panem in a repressive regime. Every year, to punish the Districts for a past rebellion and to prevent future uprisings, the Capitol holds a lottery in which one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen from each district. These kids, called \\"tributes,\\" then fight each other to the death in front of a television audience in a reality-show-on-steroids called The Hunger Games.<br /><br />This trilogy (\\"The Hunger Games,\\" \\"Catching Fire,\\" and \\"Mockingjay\\") follows the first-person story of Katniss, who volunteers for the Hunger Games in place of her younger sister; the two boys who are her romantic interests in the obligatory love triangle; and how she becomes the public face of the gradual rebellion against the Capitol that she helps to ignite.<br /><br />The characters are consistent and vividly drawn, if rather predictable; there's always plenty of action in the plot; and I love how the stories mimic the media-obsessed culture we live in today, in which even gladiators fighting to the death have to have their own costume and make-up teams. The rebellion against the Capitol strikes especially strong in view of the recent \\"Arab Spring\\" that took place in repressed countries of the Middle East and North Africa.<br /><br />Many readers say \\"The Hunger Games\\" resembles (or rips off) a 1999 Japanese novel called \\"Battle Royale.\\" Since I've never read the other novel I can't say whether it does or not, but I think there's a good chance the authors of both of these books came up with them independently of each other. All authors borrow from some source; a truly original idea is rare nowadays. The idea of children being sacrificed to appease some hostile deity is as old as the ancient Greeks; schoolchildren killed one another in the book \\"Lord of the Flies;\\"and the concept of death games as public entertainment has been the subject of several recent movies such as \\"Death Race,\\" so each author had plenty to borrow from.<br /><br />Warning: Although most of the killings in the first book of the trilogy occur \\"off-screen\\", so to speak, the books do become progressively more violent, so if you have kids you will have to use your judgement on whether you will allow them to read these books or wait until they are more mature. Some readers have in fact been disappointed with the direction the trilogy takes in the third book, in which there is a violent all-out war of rebellion against the Capitol and in which Katniss gradually becomes hardened by her experiences. My opinion on this is that yes, it is disturbing but it is also realistic. War and violence changes you, sometimes not always for the better. Just ask any soldier returning from Afghanistan or any civilian war refugee.<br /><br />This trilogy is definitely worth reading as a reflection on how violence affects us, on the instinct toward self-preservation in the face of conflict, and of the world as it could be - and sometimes is - today.dependently of each other.

B005Z271Y6|5.0|This is one of the most incredible live performance videos I have ever seen. It is very evident that there is a very good chemistry between the audience and Adele. Maybe she uses some bad language between the songs but the audience loves it and when she starts singing you forget all about that. The sound and image quality is excellent and the cutting of the video gives a good feeling of what it must have been like to be there. I'm sure that we will get to hear a lot more from Adele and I really hope to get a chance so watch her live.
B006UG909U|5.0|I've been a fan for 30+ years and they are one of the best rock bands of all times. They were still very good with Sammy, but nothing compares to the Dave years.  This album delivers the goods. Yeah, Dave's not the greatest singer and yeah, the mix is a little off, but true fans know that's not what VH is or has been about. IT'S ABOUT KICK ASS ROCK AND ROLL! There's something for every VH fan here. Who cares if the songs are \\"taken from the vault\\". The tunes cover all the different styles and types from VH1 all the way through and including some of the Sammy years. I actually think the bass is better now and that Wolfie is way busier than Michael Anthony ever was (no offense). I've tried Chickenfoot and to me there is no comparison. I'd rather have rockin' retakes then the newly written mellowed out \\"artistic\\" stuff Chickenfoot does.  To any VH fan out there, buy this album now and enjoy the return of one the greatest bands ever. I just hope they can continue on and give us more in the coming years!

We have the original iPad and the case just doesn't work that great. Yes, it lets you stand up the iPad perfectly, but the controls that you need, like the volume control, are all hidden by the straps. So while it's a great idea, it needs some tweaking before I'd recommend it to a friend.

I was happy for her and her family, but it was a bittersweet joy as I was left wondering about the long-term effects such an ordeal would have on all the innocent parties involved. I'm probably not the only one who considered whether or not Jaycee had been broken by nearly two decades of suffering at the hands of a maniacal, self-absorbed madman. I'd later receive my answer, first via Jaycee's ABC News interview with Diane Sawyer, then in her memoir; A Stolen Life.  In some ways I feel A Stolen Life is Jaycee's valiant stand against the diabolical oppressor who controlled her life since childhood. It is mentioned in her memoir that he didn't approve of her writing things down, so her brave decision to pen this book is poetic justice and a testament to the integrity of her spirit. With her words, she destroys the smoke and mirrors he's used to deceive so many people for far too long. Some excerpts make it obvious that the words were emanating from the innocent soul of a young girl whose interests and hobbies mirrored some of my youthful aspirations. Yet other passages contrast her dream-filled entries with seemingly endless dark clouds of injustice.  I've seen other reviews referring to Jaycee's repeated entries about the various pets she kept while in captivity as `redundant' and `unimportant', but on the contrary I believe her furry companions were an important escapism. Caring for pets was the final attachment Jaycee had left of her identity, especially since she was robbed of her own name, among many other things. Having pets gave her some sense of normalcy and I believe it helped preserve her resilience during her eighteen years in hell.  At times, Jaycee's story was very difficult to read due to the unflinching recounting of the nauseating atrocities Jaycee had to endure. I found myself shedding tears several times while reading of her ordeal. Not only was she held prisoner and forced to learn about life and sexuality through the skewed perception of her vile rapist, but she was forced to give birth--without proper medical care--to two children fathered by him. Still, I reminded myself that though I had the freedom to turn away at anytime, Jaycee wasn't granted such merciful luxury.  Remarkably, Jaycee managed to keep it all together. She is a true survivor in every sense of the word. Though her mind and body were under tyrannous control, her spirit remained unbroken and determined to protect what she held most dear--her children. The payoff is that there is a happy end to this otherwise tragic story. Upon completing the final page I was left inspired. Even in the midst of darkness, Jaycee was able to find strength and love and used them as a means to survive inconceivable horror and despair.  As some readers have pointed out, the book is often written in simplistic language and is somewhat choppy and rushed in places, but in all fairness, I think the author did well considering her level of education at the time it was written. A Stolen Life may not be for the squeamish, but it's an intriguing glimpse into the heart, mind and soul of an inspiring survivor who is determined to not only heal herself and her family, but also others who have suffered the pain of abduction.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is definitely a quality puzzle-type game.  I was getting bored with some of the other games I have on my kindle fire, so I went in search of a new game and found this.  It's got an interesting concept behind it.  Stacking things to fit in a given area (kind of like a tangram, but vertical). Some of the things you're stacking aren't durable and can't have too much else stacked on top of them without breaking.  Really amusing game though - it has an interesting style and it's going to have my attention for a while anyway :)
B004UID2LC|5.0|perfect! I totally love this app....it has just what I'm looking for......ive recently downloaded my favorite Tv shows and movies......

B000K4X5XA|5.0|I know my review's title is rather bold and might be subject to debate. However, I can't see how.  Sure, these kinds of movies are made nowadays with such huge budgets and more eye dazzling special effects....but they all lack the sincerity and wonder of Richard Donner's 1978 masterpiece.  Let's face it. Donner approached this film with almost a religious reverence. In his own words, Superman is \\"Americana\\". He could easily have done this in a campy fashion with a tongue rooted firmly in cheek, as was the Batman series a decade earlier. Instead, he decided to make it epic in scope and a sincere tribute to the archetype of super powered heroes. Given the time this film was made and released (the turbulent 70s), it could have lent itself to being \\"hokey\\" or \\"sappy\\"...but it wasn't. It was a breath of fresh air and, like Star Wars the previous year, was a milestone in cinematic special effects. Sure, you could look at it now and say \\"so what\\", but back in 1978, I could have SWORN Chris Reeve was flying. In my mind, it still looks ten times better than the CGI drivel that pollutes the genre now.  Christopher Reeve is the only person who could have done this role justice. I can't imagine another actor doing a better job. They tried with a Reeve clone in the abysmal Superman Returns (although...I will say Routh was the best thing about that movie). Cavill looks good in recent pics I've seen....but I am reserving judgment until the Snyder film comes out next year.  From the grandeur of the opening credits (still gives me shivers every time I watch) to the final pass over Earth as the sun rises and Reeve smiles at the audience, as if to be winking to the viewer and saying \\"try not to enjoy yourself...I DARE you\\"....It is the epitome of what this kind of film should be. Superhero flicks are so cookie cutter in 2012 that the studios crank at least a dozen or more of them every year. When this was released, it was the first of it's kind and truly an event.  I will swear to mydying day....there hasn't been a film based on a comic book character since that could touch this one. It's the standard by which I judge superhero films on...and it still hasn't been matched. Nolan's Batman films came close...but they lacked the wonder and grandeur because he spent too much time trying to base everything in REALITY.  There's too much reality to deal with every day....Superman takes me away and I am flying right there with him. 34 years later....I'm still enjoying the flight.  Thanks Mr. Donner....and rest well Mr. Reeve. My childhood owes a debt I could never repay.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|in this game, you play until you get all the games you can unlock :) its a nice effective way for users to keep playing, and most of the games are pretty fun and addicting..definitely worth the free price
0385344228|5.0|This is a riveting story that I couldn't put down. So well done: the characters, the dialogue, the twists and turns in the story, the ending: powerful! Tight story, no loose ends. I sympathized with the mom and the dad, really makes you ponder your capacity for objectivity as a parent. (I'm female, 58, nother, artist, and I love a good story.)

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved the first two books, but what I adored most about this one was the internal struggles and the realization of being used. The giant chess game that is Katniss' life.<br />I thought that the progression of this story was fantastic, up until the very end. That's not to say everything happened too quickly, not at all. It's more like Collins had a deadline and had to throw the end together. Every thought, decision, and outfit was detailed, defined, described, and laid out through the entire series... until the end of this one. Then, it was like everything was rushed, vague, done without much detail to reason or thought.<br />One star off for rushing the end of a great story!
B004SIIBGU|3.0|well it isn't really like ebay on my laptop its set out weird so its ok,............and it Alleluia u have to go through all this setup crap so I like it a little bit! !!!!!!!!!!!!!

B003IKMR0U|5.0|A friend of mine brought this game to a geek game night once and everyone loved it. It literally takes about a minute to learn. You get to be zombies and you want to eat brains. Sometimes you get shot. Pretty simple. That being said, there's a fair amount of odds and risk taking in the game and it seems most people really have a fun time. It's a great game to warm up with before delving into geekier stuff.
193413712X|5.0|If you like plot twists and action in your novels, this isn't a book for you.  It's hard to describe a work like this.  I found it breathtaking.  Beautiful.  It is a story told through the eyes of George Cosby, a man on his deathbed surrounded by his family as his mind - sometimes lucid sometimes hallucinating - pulls up memories of his life as a clockmaker. More often, the life he imagines is of his father, Howard, a tinker riding the back roads of Maine with his wares, an old mule named Prince Albert, a poetic eye and haunting visions often sparked by epileptic fits.  Even though the words are all conjured on a deathbed, this novel is life affirming. Like in a Faulkner novel, the past in Tinkers is never over, it isn't even past.  The words and passages come at you like waves in an elegiac poem with the stark and mysterious woods of Maine as an ever presence.<br /><br />It's the kind of novel I would write if I were a genius.<br /><br />There's a scene in the novel that is particularly haunting.  In my mind's eye I'm looking down at this dream-like episode as if I were perched high atop a tree -- I don't remember precisely if that's how Harding wrote it, but that's how I remember it.  Here's this woman in her bedroom slippers on a frozen pond with an axe, and in a moment of desperation she tries to break through the ice. It's nighttime with no other sounds drifting through the trees except for the hollow reverberations of her axe hitting the ice which is far too thick to budge.  It is the harsh Maine winter bearing down on her that helps to drive her nuts in the first place, and yet, the bitter cold is the very thing that saves her in the end.  Not sure why this scene got to me but it did, and there are countless other scenes throughout the novel -- some as quick as a snapshot -- that got to me too.<br /><br />You should by this book!

1442419814|5.0|Started this book while substitute teaching at the local junior high school. Was so enthralled, I stayed late to finish it, then ordered the Kindle versions of the next two books in the trilogy. Imaginative story-telling on an age-old premise. Humans always seem to take a concept (in this case, beauty) a little too far. Excellent book for adults, young adults, and teens alike.
B006JN5KBG|5.0|Fright Night has been one of my favourite horror films since I saw it on VHS in the mid-eighties at the tender age of eleven. Even before I watched it, a friend told me the premise and it immediately seemed tantalising. Not for one moment did my eyes leave the screen.  The highlights of course are veteran actors McDowall and Sarandon who turn in perfect performances as the cowardly TV host and vampire respectively. Much like many films of this genre in the 80's, they were a labour of love for the filmmakers; Tom Holland wrote and directed as did Richard Wenk with Vamp. Yes, they are camp and a little dated these days, but the hard work shows on screen. The special effects were probably quite elaborate for the time, but hokey or not, aren't they meant to look a little crooked? Afterall, Fright Night is a wink and a nod to all those late night horror movies we loved staying up to watch as a child - Peter Vincent (PETER Cushing/VINCENT Price)!!  And now we have it on glorious Blu-Ray with a DTSHD audio track, and a bonus audio track of Brad Fiedel's floral music score. A gift for any fan. The film stock used to shoot the movie probably wasn't the best as the colour scheme's don't quite jump off the screen as I'd hoped, but it's a clean enough transfer in mighty 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Unless you were one of the lucky one's like me who bought a copy for $40 from Screenarchives.com, you'll now be expecting to pay around $100 since it was limited to 3000 copies worldwide. Try Ebay now and again. You won't regret it!!
1594744769|3.0|Interesting premise for a story. Loved the old photographs and the way they were integrated into the story. However, the whole tale pointed toward a series of novels and didn't stand on its own as a solid storyline.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|This product is awesome. I am running AMD 1090T at 3.6GHZ and 12GB of RAM at 1600MHZ. Computer is stable. I have purchased this motherboard as a replacement for my broken ASUS mta89gtd motherboard (P.O.S. and overpriced).

B004G600A4|5.0|Tangled is a Disney movie that is a re-telling of the Rapunzel story, done in the CGI fashion that is now most popular, as opposed to hand-drawn Disney movies that my generation grew up with. Tangled tells the story of Rapunzel, a young princess that is stolen away from her king and queen mother when she is just a baby. She is carried away to a tall tower deep in the woods, where she is never allowed to leave, only to look out of the windows. She makes it her home, and is raised as a daughter of the evil witch who took her, though she treats her relatively well. Every year on her birthday, Rapunzel watches out of the window while hundreds of lanterns are released at once; she doesn't know what they are for but she longs to see them in person. She decides one day that she's finally going to do it: she's going to escape and see the lanterns. Meanwhile, Flynn Rider, a local thief, is attempting to steal the crown that belongs to Rapunzel in the castle, and while he is successful at retrieving it, he is chased out of the castle by guards, and stumbles upon Rapunzel's tower. After some (very funny) confusion, Rapunzel enlists his help in taking her to see the lanterns, promising to show him where she his hid his (her) crown in return. They go out to see the lanterns with many adventures along the way, and fall for each other as they spend time together. The movie ends happily, as all Disney movies do, with great musical numbers scattered in between.  I really, really adored this movie. It's not often that I can turn off a movie and immediately want to watch it again, but I did with this one. The characters were funny (especially the palace horse) and likable, and I loved the songs that they sang (which, thankfully, weren't too many). It really reminded me of Disney movies that I loved growing up, even though it wasn't hand-drawn like they were. The spirit, the essence, of Disney, was there. The romance was believable (even though he was a thief and it didn't seem to bother anyone?) and I loved Rapunzel's character, and her little pet chameleon that was very protective of her. I liked that Rapunzel had dreams that she wasn't afraid to chase after. It's a movie that's great for children and adults alike, with real repeatability. I laughed out loud a lot. I haven't had a chance to watch it again, but I'm sure it won't be soon before I do.  JaKlReviews.com
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I'm a professional writer, and have been using this app for several months now on 2 devices. While not perfect, this app is very good at handling MS Office style functions. It handles large files, so though after about 35 pages it becomes hard to navigate them. I'm writing a novel on it.  One thing to note is if you plan to use this app on multiple devices, you have to buy the app for each of them. I got one for $15 and then got a sale price on the second directly from the company for $10.  It works with Dropbox, and but only if you use the app to open the doc from there once, and then you can grab it out of the recent menu.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Love the game. The only problem I have is that to unlock some of the games cost too many points.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is a great way to waste a lot of time. It has beautiful graphics, challenging levels and is overall an interesting use of time. It is enjoyed by all ages in our household.
B000UVLK1M|5.0|As a jazz musician for the past 30 years, I have always considered Herbie's work to be of the highest integrity,brilliance and thoughtfullness. This album was so subtle, beautiful and intimately representative of the author. As is so often the case, Herbie and Wayne sound like they were playing from two sides of the same gene-ius. Dave Holland plays with the unusual sensitivity and perfect restraint. Dean Parks and Lionel Loueke share the same sensitivity. Vinnie Coliuta shows so much maturity. If you don't know the words to these songs, get them! You will begin to enjoy the depth of interpretation and nuance that this work offers. I have never, after 3 years, put this disc on and not been brought to great emotional and technical amazement in the same moment. How many stars can you give art?
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Very fun game to play on the Kindle Fire, My favorite so far after buying several game apps. This game had me hooked, I  didn't want to put it down!! The clues are a great help just in case you get stuck. I can't wait to buy another game just like this.

B003Y5HWJU|4.0|Having read the nonfiction book on which this show is based, I was pleased with the attention to detail.  Physically, the show is wonderful.  Atlantic City, the boardwalk, the tacky stores, even the incubators on display with premature babies presented like animals in a zoo.  All were really in Atlantic City.  Naturally, when creating the plot for the show, many liberties were taken.  However, speculation can be amusing and seeing a young Al Capone at the beginning of his career was fun.  There IS lots of violence, but it was a violent time.  Watching Nucky Johnson run the town, deal with gangsters, influence the political scene in New Jersey, and have a pretty full private life kept me entertained through each episode.  I've already pre-ordered season two and can hardly wait for it to arrive.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I've heard her songs before and didn't think much about them. I decided to buy this album for my birthday yesterday and I have never been pleased, nay, in love with EVERY song on an album like I have with this one. Her voice is enchanting. Beautiful. Every second of it.
B005H0IW6W|3.0|OK.  I saw him on TV.  He was interviewed here and there and everyone was raving about him.  I didn't know much about him, but his voice sounded nice (what I heard on TV anyway).  My family collects Christmas CD's, so I took a chance and ordered this one.  I was truly underwhelmed.  His voice is smooth (too smooth?), but I just couldn't get into his versions of songs I loved.  I'm not sure we'll grab this cd next Christmas when we're looking for music to get us in a holiday mood.  Guess we'll stick with Tony Bennett and Andy Williams.

B005K17RU0|1.0|Accuweather keeps 'stopping unexpectedly'. It usually happens when I try to open it or when I'm changing something, like the settings for example. The first time I was able to open Accuweather I went to the map and when I tried to find my town, it froze my kindle!! I couldn't even shut my kindle down! I had to wait for it to run put of battery before I could get off of that thing. Now I have to completely reset my kindle, and get back all of my data that I lost. GGGGRRRRRRRRR............. I am SO uninstalling this app. Don't waste your time on this people. I mean it. Don't. I only gave this one star because it's 'required'.
B004SBQALA|5.0|Despite the review I read that though ill of the movie, I thought it was great, from start to end. Quite an original space alien theme. Or so I think.  But if there is a comparison,  it is with SMALLVILLE, which I also like. Certainly more drama and action, even violence, than ET, another favorite, but no gore. Glad I decided to check it out.  There has been a fairly large gap in time between seeing the movie and being asked the review. One thing that stand out; there better be a sequel, the need for such not showing up until the end. Though the movie didn't end with a cliffhanger, I will highly disappointed if there isn't a sequel and soon.
B006PHD0RW|1.0|The app would not work on my Samsung galaxy s2 which qualifies as the high end device they claim this app works on. Uninstall.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|I was dubious about downloading this app, not sure it would be my cup of tea, but I was happily proven wrong.  Challenging, especially with the timing that comes furtgher into the game, but still beatable.  My only complaint is that some things seem to crush too easily or sometimes not at all when they should.  For example, if you stack three cereal boxes, the bottom box is liable to be crushed, yet watermelon rolling against a carton of milk does nothing.  All in all, well worth getting.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Like this game a lot. It has a lot of variety and my kids love it too. Would recommend for all age groups!
0143119680|3.0|I had a love/hate relationship with this book. I loved the way Ms. Harkness strings her words together. At times her writing had an almost lyrical quality to it--her turn of phrase captivated. She writes about science in general, and alchemy specifically, as if she'd studied it all her life. Rarely did I get bogged down in her detailed descriptions. The storyline was excellent: from her characterizations to her scene settings. This is one of the best novels I've read in a long time, and I've read some great ones lately. I love the world Harkness created. Many have compared it to the Twilight series. I don't see, and I think she's a better writer.<br /><br />That being said, why then am I only giving this book 3 to 3.5 stars? POV shifts. The book starts out in first person, in Diana's voice, and I assumed the entire book would remain that way. Imagine my surprise when, in chapter nine, Harkness shifts to Mathew's POV, using third person instead. It was jarring to say the least, but I adjusted. The head hopping--moving from Mathew's to say Hamish's and others--was annoying and at times confusing. I think I get her reasoning for the switch to third person--she wanted Mathew's voice to be distinct from Diana's--but the head hopping was too much. Other times she slipped into narrator's voice as well, giving the book an identity crisis of sorts.<br /><br />Despite this Harkness still achieved deep POV with both Diana and Mathew. So I guess she was successful. They say you have to know the rules before you break them. Still I wish she'd tighten her POV's just a little.<br /><br />I can't wait to see where the next book Shadow Night goes. I would recommend this book as long as you can overlook the POV issues.
B006UG90RM|5.0|It's been a long time since I stuck a CD in my player and didn't hit \\"skip\\" button here and there. As you read through these reviews you get the feeling that a long overdue rock album has finally arrived. Rock has kind of been in a doldrum this last decade and it took a band like Van Halen to give it a kick in the seat of the pants. To be clear, there has been a lot a great metal and prog metal (thank God for that). But here is some straight forward bistering hard rock baby. If this band has aged it is like a fine wine.<br /><br />First off Eddie is totally smoking on this one. Great to hear an album laced with searing tasty lead solos again. And yes, Virginia, there are a lot of shredders out there. But Eddie puts his soul into his playing and it's not just the speed but the emotion behind it. The man is a legend and on this album he shows you why.<br /><br />Then there's Alex, truly an underated rock drummer. On this album he is kicking ass and taking names. And any concern about the Van Halen rhythm section with the departure of Michael Anthony is quickly dispelled. It's like young Wolfgang has breathed a new life into their playing. I was quick to notice how the bass was brought more forward in the mix and how tight Wolfgang is with Dad and Uncle. And Van Halen now has three Van Halens, how frigging cool is that? Not to say MA wasn't great and his soaring vocals are missed. But the energy that young Wolfgang has brought to this band is quite apparent.<br /><br />Lastly Diamond Dave is back. You might love him or hate him but he's right in your face. I followed Dave through all of his solo albums and I think he's in top form on this album. Both vocally and lyrically. We did miss you, Dave!<br /><br />So when I read some of the few negative reviews, I gotta say I put this album in the top 5 of Van Halen albums. You folks are definately \\"glass half empty\\" people. Lighten up man. It's 2012 and Van Halen is back. Whether your a hard core fan or casual rocker this album should ignite you. Great album and I can hardly wait to see them live in Anaheim in June.<br /><br />Cheers, baby!can hardly wait to see them live in Anaheim in June.  Cheers, baby!
0439023513|3.0|I so enjoyed the first two books of the Hunger Games trilogy, that I was particularly excited to start the final installment. While many of the battle scenes and Katniss' internal conflicts up to her ultimate realizations were well thought out and written I felt incredibly let down in a couple of the characters' fates. The two that bothered me most were that of Gale and Finnick. Particularly because I would have felt a larger impact from the subsequent climax had Gale died in the sewers in place of Finnick. The more I think of that, the more sense it makes to me. Especially when you come to find out the Gale just \\"has a fancy job in District 2\\". That's it? A brush off ending for one of the major characters in the series. Overall an 'ok' read. I liked that she touched on a lot of the characters' in the end, but felt as though fleshing-out the ending another few chapters couldn't have hurt. Just my opinion. I would still recommend the series to any reader.
0385333846|5.0|It's been many years since I read Slaughterhouse Five, and while some passages have aged poorly, the overall experience is still a wonderful read. Well worth picking up again. Maybe it's just a phase I'm going through, but I read so many newer novels I don't review because they just aren't good and I don't want to denigrate them. This was a pleasure, soundly demonstrating why some books are classics. Five resounding stars.
B004U52VPS|4.0|I bought it for my son. He was getting addicted to the video game so I decided to get an alternative. I like that the whole family can get involved! Educationally, the older kids can keep track of points and it's just plain fun for the little ones to knock it over!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Fabulously creative! Outstanding graphics. Interesting hunting. Loved the seasons. Enough locations so that it was sometimes hard to remember where you'd been and where you hadn't, which made it more challenging and fun.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is fun to pass the time and is pretty challenging at times. It is something the kids could enjoy and stay occupied with if needed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is mindless fun ... lots of fun, especially on my kindle fire. It is even more fun if you have a cat on your lap.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|okay for passing the time. controls are a little iffy, but overall good. dunno why they updated, as it seems to be causing more problems than it has solved
B005V20JKI|3.0|DONT UPDATE YOU WILL LOOSE ALL OF UR PROGRESS. I LIKED IT TILL I UPDATED IT. IM UPSET. WHY DID IT DO THAT? NOW I HAVE TO START OVER......)
B005JZBP8W|1.0|Firstly, this is one of my all-time favorite films, and one of the rare films that I can watch again and again. So my one-star rating refers to this Blu-ray release and not the film itself. My first reaction to watching this blu-ray was disbelief; waiting 3 years for the blu-ray release thinking (hoping) that the delay was due to their working with the on the original 65mm negatives. NOT!! The quality of this transfer is IDENTICAL to the DVD, (i.e., poor in both cases); in fact I did a back to back comparision of the bluray with the upconverted DVD (using an Oppo player and a 100\\" projection screen). Additionally, the quality of the DTS HD surround is NO BETTER than the compressed DD on the DVD. DO NOT buy this blu-ray if you already have the DVD. If you do not have the DVD, I suppose you should go ahead an buy it - but do not expect it to do justice to your high-def TV.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Was a great app on the Fire. Simple and easy to use. When I tried to download an update today, well,it's still installing 8 hours later.
0375842209|2.0|I, like a very small percentage of reviewers, was disappointed by The Book Thief.  I am a little shocked at what a low percentage it is, especially since I mentioned the book to a group of four colleagues and two said that they had begun reading but never bothered to finish it.  I did find the book too slow and a little dull.  Perhaps because I have recently read If This Is A Man and The Truce by Primo Levi, a biographical account of life in a Nazi concentration camp, that I failed to pick up on any of the poignancy in The Book Thief that so many other reviewers seem to have uncovered.  I found the language quite basic which I struggled to accept as the story is narrated by Death - an ancient and superior being, however humanely he is depicted in the book.  I found some of Deaths narration and commentary annoying and unnecessary.  An example is his attachment and translation of events into colours.  Perhaps colours instantly evoke certain emotions in other readers that made these passages particularly moving but for me, perhaps embarrassingly, they were just a little confusing.  It's not the worst thing I have ever read by any stretch of the imagination, just a bit disappointing.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|The DVD is great.  So glad we found i!  Just as promised and just what we expected.  Love this classic .
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I've been playing adventure games for years and am disappointed that they don't have more of a presence on tablets/phones. It's nice to see a developer like this creating games like this.<br />The game is solid, albeit short and a little too easy. I was astonished how all of the puzzles didn't need a huge leap of logic to figure out, which can ruin a good adventure game for me. Nice job. The graphics were nice and the interface was simple to use. All the tutorial you should need is right in the words point and click, or with this game, just point. But you could have included some kind of popular tut that showed you how to use the map and item system for the utterly clueless, afterall those whiners will give you a 1 star for something beyond your control.<br />The price is just about right. At 2 bucks you can't beat the 3-4 hour playtime you get. We need more games like this on phones and tablets.<br />Oh and played on my kindle fire which displayed fine. Look forward to your next game.
B001202LRM|1.0|Don't bother unless you are into this nu-metal crap. some call them thrash metal. Give me a break. Nothing remotley close to the classic thrash bands. Every song sounds the same with that low end tuned down boring azz bass. Pass please
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this game is highly addictive, I Could not put it down. the three modes are clever and interesting. I got it for free, but would tots buy it for full price.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I bought the 405CX with HRM as a Christmas present to myself this year.  I've previously used my iPhone with Runkeeper, but was looking to upgrade to something easier to carry (i.e. - no armband). I'd read all the reviews and complaints, so I knew the weaknesses of the design, and after receiving it, I was pretty pleased with it, initially.  Yes, the bezel isn't the most intuitive design, and it does not function when it's wet with snow or rain.  However, like many have mentioned, you set it to auto-scroll, and lock the bezel when you start running, and it's fine.  I like that you can customize the screens to show the stats that you want to see.  I also like that Runkeeper can import data directly off the watch, so I can keep all my new runs with my old Runkeeper data.<br /><br />The problem with my watch was that it quit acquiring satellites after the third use. I tried everything mentioned online, like resetting the watch, recharging, etc.  It just simply quit working.  Fortunately, it was still in the last few days of Amazon's return window, and they refunded my purchase. So, how do I rate it?  Hard to say -- I probably just got a defective unit, but I won't try this model again. I'm still debating what to replace it with.  If the Timex Run Trainer didn't use Training Peaks software, I'd be all over it.  I'm probably going to pick up the Forerunner 610, even though it will cost more than twice what this watch cost.
B003I87O2I|5.0|This cd is fantastic .... it's so great to have some fresh rock from a great band. And the new singer is absolutely wonderful. The energy is awesome. I hope they keep this going. Of course it sounds like Foreigner, because that's who it is.
B003PPDBQ2|2.0|I purchased this book because if the reviews I had seen about it which were mainly positive, however I finished this book and felt a bit disappointed by it. I found that it was a bit repetitive and I didn't find the ending to be particularly good, I don't think that it was very well written and I found some parts to be rushed. The overall storyline to the book is good but I just feel that it could have been written better. I wouldn't recommend this book.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|Being a Criminal Minds addict, had to have sixth season even though it lost both J.J. and Emily.  Don't know if I hadn't known they were coming back, I would have purchased, but everyone else is loved, too.  Now loving season seven and will probably purchase it, too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app daily. I love the reading plans,. It speaks and is easy to use. Moves smoothly from chapter to chapter. It would be great to be able to use it without wi-fi but I still have to give it five stars. I'm very thankful for this app!!!
B006TXDOZ0|5.0|Being a huge fan of their debut album Baby Darling Doll Face Honey, I have been eagerly anticipating this release and I can happily say I'm pretty keen on it. It's a little more on the softer side than the first album, so my only gripe would be that I found myself from time to time missing that harder bluesy southern edginess that got me hooked initially. But every band has to keep moving forward, it feels like a logical progression and after a few plays I'm equally addicted to it.<br /><br />I've seen them in Williamsburg (w/ Whigs and 22-20s) and they were f'n epic, going to see them in Boston next month and expect to be blown away again. Grab this album, you won't regret it, and don't miss these guys live if you get the chance.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just saw them last night, they crushed it, played so many songs and sounded great.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|soooooo much fun! I love this gameeee there are games you unlock and games that are already unlocked. Great for kindle fire!!
B006PHD0RW|1.0|It keeps foreclosing on Samsung Epic 4g. So I uninstalled the game. The game could use a good patch. Thank you.
B006PHD0RW|2.0|I am upset because I love this game but for some reason the touch screen doesn't connect with this game. I try to touch and grab the objects but half the time it dose not read it.
B000I8G5B2|5.0|and loved it.  the whole thing from the plot to the actors was written and picked to be the  best for the movie.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Cam be customized.  Gorgeous widget in many size options. Runs smoothly on Optimus S. Even has earthquake data, which is a pleasant surprise.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|when i first heard about this book i thought it would stink then i started to read it and i thought was awesome
B006PHD0RW|5.0|While I am not too excited about games, this is an exception. It works great on my Thunderbolt and Kindle Fire.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this game is adorable and I cant stop playing it. I'm literally in love wit this cute game. its the best on my kindle so far. &lt;3
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works perfectly on my kindle fire. Pick it up if you like solitaire,  It has many different modes to choose from, and youcan't beat the price its free!
B005T87QCI|1.0|I heard a lot of bad things about it. there is no main chariters! &iexcl;&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I'm out suckers to how bot the game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|If you've seen Downton Abbey, you already know what fun & involved drama this Masterpiece series represents. If you're a fan, the uncut DVD of season 2 does contain some content that was edited out of the version broadcast in the United States, which does add some additional background & detail to the story, especially early in the season. If you love the series, I'd recommend this as an enjoyable supplement to what you've seen.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Wohoo!!!!!!! It was amazing and extremely fun!!!! I love it!!!! Wohoo!!!! I really hope there is a squel!!!!!! hay hay!!!
1846142733|1.0|Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902), Indian spiritualist on 9/11/1893 at World Parliament of Religions, Chicago said to the gathering:<br /><br />\\"We who had come from the east have sat here day after day and have been told in a patronizing way that we ought to accept Christianity because Christian nations are the most prosperous. We look about us and we see England the most prosperous Christian nation in the world, with her foot upon the neck of 250,000,000 Asiatics. We look back into history and see that the prosperity of Christian Europe begin with Spain. Spain's prosperity began with the invasion of Mexico. Christianity wins its prosperity by cutting the throats of its fellow men. At such a price the Hindoo will not have prosperity.<br />They come to my country and abuse my forefathers, my religion, and everything; they walk near a temple and say `you idolators, you will go to hell', but they dare not do this to the Mohammedans of India, for the sword will be out, but the Hindu is too mild.<br /><br />And may I ask you, Europeans, what country you have ever raised to better conditions? Wherever you have found weaker races, you have exterminated them by the roots, as it were. You have settled on their lands, and they are gone for ever. What is the history of your America, your Australia, and New Zealand, your Pacific Islands and South Africa? Where are the aboriginal races there today? They have all been exterminated, you have killed them outright, as if they were wild beasts. It is only where you have not the power to do so, and there only, that other nations are still alive.<br /><br />If Christianity is a saving power in itself, why has it not saved the Ethiopians, the Abyssinians?\\"
B0063IH60K|5.0|great app ... hours of fun. great options available to customize game play and game fun. app runs smooth, no glitches or slow downs.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! It is so interesting because its never the same game and you work to get new games. I would definetaly recommend this game.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I bought this for my Galaxy Tab 7 Plus. It fits perfectly and makes a snug fitting place to put my Tab when not in use. I would have preferred something made specifically for it, but it was all I could find. I have to say though, it has worked perfectly. It's well made, flexible without losing protection. I haven't noticed any smell, and am very satisfied. I don't think I'll be in a big hurry to get something else. Unless I splurge and buy a Kindle Fire just because....then I might have to buy something for my Galaxy :-).
B002BWP49C|5.0|I recieved movie to day 2-15-2012 great movie and look forward to part 2 -It's alsome have brought every 1 and a few posters and the doll's of edward and her and really appreciate getting all my favorite movies ect for my self boys and family
B002BWP49M|2.0|Too much was different about this movie compared to the previous twilight movies. Parts were draged out that shouldnt have been, parts, the sets were different than in previous movies...itwas directed  differently and in a way i didnt cafe for. Some scenes were twilight meets csi even!i didnt like that at all. Depressing and gory!  Imust sayithink this film shoul win awards for themake up and special effects but the humor in the movie and everything else was too far off base. Thisdidnt live up tomy expectations in the least.iwas dissappointed by this film. Id have liked the style tohave been the same as it was in the previous movies. I canat least say the story stayed true to the books.
0062082353|3.0|This book is like watching 300 or Gladiator--intense action but not much story. It does give an insight into SEALs and some of their mindset. Being retired military I understand the focus and drive required for our fighting men and women. Many do not understand it, and the comments by Taya reflect some of that and I think really add a personal touch to the story.  Unfortunately I, like others, expected more information on the challenges of being a sniper and actual shooting challenges. Instead the discussion is very, very brief and casual, with not much detail. I'm not referring to classified information, but the basics of long-distance shooting and the challenges, as well as the challenges faced by Chris and his SEALs against enemy snipers.  Instead Chris focuses a lot on the number of fist fights he has been in and beating up on others and teammates. Granted, some of this is part of the culture, but all the bar fights really detracts from the story. Chris has sacrificed tremendously for our country. I take nothing away from his effort and his bravery. He is a soldier, and not necessarily an author. So he tells a great story from the viewpoint of a grunt, and not a distant observer like many books. Like they say, freedom is not free but requires the price of blood. Most of our politicians do not understand this, and Chris even points out some of our military leaders don't understand this (which I think is true). I would have thought after the disaster in Vietnam with politics controlling policy we would have learned, but Chris reveals that a lot of this is the same today as it was then.  I wish there had been more emphasis on the SEALs, the sniping, and about the people--especially how they seem to not understand freedom and what people like Chris have done for them.  A very easy read, the book is entertaining for the most part (as I said, the bar fight stories get old). Sad about the men that have been lost and Chris does a great job honoring them.
B006PHD0RW|2.0|This is a pretty good game, but it crashes any time I don't have a wifi connection, which makes it hard to play when I'm not at home.
B00004Y6O7|1.0|This is basically unlistenable junk. With the exception of 1984 & DD, each Van Halen LP after the first great album kept getting weaker and weaker. I could not find one song on this to keep me from getting rid of it and I tried hard to like something on it. Even Diver Down is much better than this because at least they tried to COVER good songs. There's a reason it was their least commercial record, IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!
0316017922|5.0|I do not normally read books that are not history novel, i like to feel that by enjoying the reading i am learning some history as well. This book is not that different because somehow explains certain things about history and facts. Really good book! It helps to break some paradigms, i would recommend it to everyone who likes to dream.
0385344325|3.0|I am a huge Lee Child/Jack Reacher fan, but must say I was disappointed in this book; had I read this one first, I don't know that I would have picked up another (which would have been a shame).  Child always emphasized Jack's physical stature before - but not in this one.  Guess he's clearing the way for actors like Tom Cruise (what a joke!) to portray Jack in the future.  Reacher has always been a naturally sexy man to me, and I think that \\"less is more\\" - I did not like the expanded sex scenes in this book at all.  Additionally, Jack also seemed more cold blooded to me than in previous books; Jack never has a problem getting things done, but this felt different.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|works extremely well, does everything I need it to do with more options than the others. works great with ics on my g2x.

160459201X|4.0|My husband and I both bought this book mine is in English and his is in Spanish .  We both enjoyed it very much my husband more so I believe because he was looking for a book that could point him in the right direction. I am currently not done  half way through and enjoying very much
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a must download if you are looking for a fun and addictive game. Very many levels. Starts out easy in instruction mode, then the game progresses into a fun advanced puzzle. Challenge your brain today and download this app!
0345529057|5.0|I would like to start by saying that I absolutely detest fantasy book. I cannot stand Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, in all fairness I have tried to read them but did not catch my interest at all. I was hesitant to start reading a series of this magnitude because I do not enjoy wasting my life on something i don't enjoy and I would like to say that this series will not disappoint. The minute I started reading I was sucked in the world of Westeros. I have burned through the series and now currently am on Dance of Dragons. I have recommended to all my friends and co-workers and all agree that story is amazing, I just can't get enough. There is only one negative thing I have to say and that is for Feast of Crows and Dance and that is the books run concurrent, so instead of making one gigantic book Martin made two. But other than that you should definatly  check out.
B000MV90IU|1.0|Amazon you should correct your description on the Audio section of this movie.It is not English French Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1,but a poor Dolby Digtal 2.0 as per Bluray.Com site.
B00005JMCN|4.0|I recorded the older version of Seabiscuit when it was shown on TV a while back.  The end of it was cut off and I never saw how it ended.  I could not find the older version to rent - so I was glad to find this newer one with good actors  and at a good price.  It arrived in good condition but I haven't watched it yet so I am not giving it five stars.
B004VPAXHU|5.0|Definitely the best Kate Bush album, combining all of her eccentricity and talent.  Very highly recommended! Do yourself a favor and pick this one up.
0375869026|5.0|August has a face like nothing anyone has ever seen. Like a screaming and running away kind of face. He has accepted that this is the face he has. Now he has to figure out how to cope with a world that has never seen a face like his. He has been homeschooled his whole life and now for 5th grade, his parents want him to go to school. A regular school. With kids who don't know him. Kids who have never seen him. For fifth grade. I know I have always thought that 5th grade is the hardest school year of anyone's life, much less, someone like August.<br />As we watch him and his classmates grow it is gratifying that none of them are as cruel and heartless as we all know modern children can be. You will tear up and stand up and cheer as you follow along with the life of August, his friends, his sister, her friends and how everyone is affected by what happens in August's life. Yes, everyone deserves a standing ovation, at least once in their lives
B005Q1W10A|5.0|LOVE IT!! Totally addicted to this show!! I watch an episode & cant wait for next week to see what happens.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I enjoy using this app at home, but can't use it on the fire without wifi, like at church.  It's easy to use and has many translations, which is great.
B0001CNRS4|3.0|This is like alot of stories where girl works at a dead end job, has a passion for dancing and wants to follow her dreams. Its a decent story but very clich&eacute;. I think Jessica Alba makes this movie work with her charismatic performance, beauty and dancing that makeup for it unoriginal storyline.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great visuals, great sounds, great gameplay. If you like Cut The Rope or Where's My Water, you'll like Bag It!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|A Dance with Dragons is George R. R. Martin's fifth volume in his A Song of Ice and Fire series.<br /><br />It has been several years since Martin published the last volume: A Feast for Crows.  For me, the time between books made the beginning of this book a little difficult.  Martin's style of writing, jumping from character to character, made it hard to keep track of the characters.  It was easier to remember the major characters: Tyrion, Jon, Bran, and Daenerys.  But keeping track of the many minor character was difficult.  And Martin uses a large cast of characters.<br /><br />In the first four books, Martin titled each chapter with the name of the main character of that chapter.  In this installment, Martin titled some chapters with phrases descriptive of the chapter's main character.  This literary device challenges the reader to discern who Martin is writing about.  Yet, it can be somewhat confusing when the reader is dealing with a large group of characters.<br /><br />In his introduction, A Cavil on Chronology, Martin explains that the first part of this book parallels A Feast for Crows.  Then, halfway through the book, the timelines come together and we read about some long forgotten main characters such as Cersei and Jaime.<br /><br />So, what are the main characters up to?  Jon Snow is learning how to be the leader of the Night Watch at the wall.  His half-brother, Bran Stark, is north of the wall being called by some mysterious force.  Arya Stark is in Braavos, across the narrow sea serving as a novice in a temple.  Tyrion Lannister is across the narrow sea trying to get to Daenerys Targaryen.  Daenerys is learning the difference between a conquering queen and a ruling queen.  She has not yet learned how to use and control her dragons.  Cersei Lannister is in prison, accused of treason and fornication.  And Jaime Lannister is riding around Westeros settling disputes between local lords.<br /><br />There are many others: Reek, Lady Melisandre, Quentyn Martel, and Asha Greyjoy, to name a few.  And don't forget all the dead white walkers north of the wall.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book.  Once I got a handle on the characters the book was a joy to read. However, I still have absolutely no idea who will be left alive at the end.<br /><br />Spoiler alert: Martin has absolutely no problem killing off a character.  Be prepared.rtel, and Asha Greyjoy, to name a few.  And don't forget all the dead white walkers north of the wall.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book.

B005LAJ1CC|5.0|I just saw the second half of this great movie this morning after catching the first half around a week ago. I agree with another reviewer, I could have sat through this entire show , all 5 hours. It is really that good.  Over the years I had seen and heard many stories about the Beatle's and this is by far the most interesting. It covers most all of the mile stones in George's life and career. The greatest asset to this film is the interviews and insights by many of the people in his life that were there. But it also is a reminder of all of his many amazing songs that were part of the fabric of my life growing up.  I am not a major Beatles fan, But they were ever present as I grew up in the 70's and have older siblings that listened ,I became familar with a lot of their music. This was like a sit down with an old friend,as I was reminded of my favorite songs and to see behind the curtain to see how they were put together was quite enjoyable.  I was looking to buy this for my older brother and I too am sorry that it is not yet available.  My advise, sit back, relax. Then buy this dvd when it becomes available, you will not be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I didn't know that it was be this fun! I thought it would be suckish like most others....but I was surprised!
B0071QIN00|5.0|this is the best game ever and you should get it even if it cost money I got it for free.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good set of games to play when you are bored or just looking to kill some free time.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love this app. great for checklists, recipes, and random notes. I love that you can organize the notes into notebooks and sync with the web, making it easy to copy and paste from the web.
1451627289|5.0|I was a long-time Stephen King admirer, but admit I haven't read much of his work for the past few years.  This book, however, caught my eye, and I decided to download and read it on my Kindle.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and will definitely look at getting back into the mind of Stephen King.  Great work from the master!
B000B6TR98|5.0|Great reissue from Sundazed.Excellent pressing, plays perfectly. The album itself is absolutely fantastic. Most people are probably familiar with the title track, but there're a lot of really great tracks on this that are often overlooked. Also, the instrumentation on this thing is really unusual. Lots of sitars, hand-drums, and harpsichords. But it really works quite well and sounds unlike any other music from its time. Recommended tracks: the title track, Legend of a Girl Child Linda, Bert's Blues (referring the legendary and highly influential Bert Jansch), The Trip, and Celeste. You really can't go wrong with anything here.
B004L35GAQ|4.0|i love the vocals of this group, it is definitely a favorite. it arrived quite quickly too.  try it, you will like it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|soooo many games!! what's not to love? there is always a game to give you a challenge or is slightly differicult.to do but it soooooooooo fun
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great little app. Well worth paying for. Even better when offered free.  Loved that is was original and not just another (insert generic app game here).
B006UG90RM|5.0|As a disclaimer, I'm a hard core Van Halen fan. I listen to the first 6 albums in heavy rotation in my younger days and adult life. It was my primary inspiration to play guitar and opened my ears to a whole world of rock I never would have seen without Van Halen. However, I remember the time I got OU812 as a Christmas gift and was so excited to hear another hour of my favorite music in the world only to become incredibly disappointed to hear a mainstream pop record; I wanted a Van Halen record. In it's own right, Van Hagar is excellent mainstream rock; as good as anything Def Leppard made, but it's not Van Halen.  That being said, I was extremely cautious of a new album. I remember the false reunion, the rumors and all the BS. After hearing the producer they were working with, and all the rumors, naysaying and eventually the single Tattoo. I was mentally prepared for disappointment, and ready to run back to Van Halen I and imagine the glory days I never saw (I born in 1983). I feared the OU812 story part 2.  I received the disk one week ago today...and haven't stopped listening to it. I literally haven't changed CD's in my car or bothered with the radio. I never skip a song. Every time I hear one song again I find something I missed the first time around, or am just too happy singing along to get bored. My dreams are now Van Halen sound tracks...again.  I won't bother with details on individual tracks. There are plenty of reviews out there that did that well and in great detail. (The best being Metal Hammer) I'm just giving my impressions 1 week after cracking the shrink wrap. Essentially, I got that same old feeling the day I brought home VHI for the first time. That alone is worth the price of admission.  I've missed you guys, and I mean it.
081297381X|5.0|This is one of those books that you wish no one else could read. Elegant, sophisticated, arrogant Taleb is the only person I could find who is a practitioner of uncertainty and writes about it.<br /><br />A breath of fresh air, I guarantee you will never think the same way after reading his book. What he writes about is fascinating, but how he writes will blow you away.<br /><br />Taleb is terrible speaker, but he is a brilliant writer.<br /><br />I believe Taleb has a hard time describing himself as person who understands that he lives in the world he does not understand but nevertheless can not only survive in it but prosper.  How do you live in the world that you do not understand? Read his book.
B006ISJQBM|2.0|theres holes in the story line and chunks missing.  i dig HST as much as the next druggy  but i'm happy he passed before seeing this movie.  when \\"Chenault\\" was dancing in the club, that guy(stranger) unzipped her dress \\"Sanderson\\" screemed NO then got booted out of the club but the look on her face wasnt terror, pain or bewilderment she looked 'normal'  later, \\"kemp\\" was outside the gates of \\"Sanderson\\"s house getting her clothes thrown at him, how did he end up there, did she ask him to get her stuff, did \\"Sanderson\\" dump her for being raped or did he dump her because she willingly had sex with that stranger on the dance floor
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I love it! It arrived in the mail at top speed and I've been listening to it ever since. If you like Florence and the Machine, I'd recommend buying Lungs if you haven't already.
B006UG90RM|4.0|Wel,, I received this disc after ordering it during the ticket purchasing process at Ticketmaster (who accidentally shipped it to the wrong address and were extremely helpful and hassle-free about sending another copy immediately).  Let's start off with - Wow! A lot of really great songs, really good performances by everyone in the band.  David Lee Roth sings as well here as ever (albeit in a lower key than ever) and Eddie still has the chops to rank among the greats.  I don't agree with those who criticize him playing for it's lack of feeling - he's just a straight ahead rock guy and that's OK.  The first 4 tracks on this disc are very good to excellent, catchy and immediately something Van Halen fans will enjoy.  There are a few others at the end, notably Beats Workin, that are also instantly likeable.  After all this time, I am actually looking forward to seeing them live.  Last, I had to deduct one star from this otherwise great album for the production and mastering - about another 4 db of dynamic range would have turned this from a very good album into an absolutely spectacular one.  Too heavy on the compression - everything is LOUD and, unfortunately, many essential elements of VH such as Alex's drum fills are simply buried in a mix that is crushed.  The songs, however, are great!  Looking forward to the vinyl as it can't be as compressed as this is.
0307956350|4.0|.<br /><br />Complicated intrigue keeps this novel entertaining as former CIA agent, Kate Moore, moves to Luxembourg with her husband and young family and begins a life as an \\"expat\\". Kate assumes Dexter's job as a systems security expert for financial institutions will give them a better life, one to include travel to various European destinations and a chance to be more involved with her two pre-school boys, Jake and Ben.<br /><br />As she settles into her new routine, becomes a full time homemaker and meets other expat moms, she realizes the role is not as exciting as her former life. Among the other expats she meets is Julia, an interior designer from Chicago and wife of Bill who develops a friendship with Dexter.<br /><br />With more time on her hands, Kate begins to question some of the events and chance meetings with Julia and Bill. Her own past begins to haunt her. Throughout their marriage, she has kept secret from Dexter the real nature of her work she described as writing position papers for the government.  Her increased suspicion that their lives are being monitored entices her to take steps of her own to confirm her doubts. Some of Kate's actions appear either amateurish or rusty for a former CIA agent. Some provide information that peaks her curiosity further.<br /><br />How can she pursue these nagging questions without arousing the suspicions of her husband? Who is behind the plot she feels developing about them? Whom can she trust? Does anyone know of her clandestine actions before she quit her job? Is her family in danger?<br /><br />Kate's thoughts often become a stream of consciousness to include some very pithy and almost humorous takes on the challenges of adjusting to and comparing the cultural differences with her American homeland. Author Chris Pavone draws on his experiences to give excellent descriptions of the European scenes. They seem very real as seen through Kate's eyes. Having lived in Europe for several years, I found it easy to identify with the locales and also the difficulty Kate has to fit in with language and custom differences.<br /><br />The author reveals the story through flashbacks, and even some flashbacks within flashbacks. Although this provides some intricate twists and turns of the plot, it sometimes makes it difficult to keep up with the thread of the story. Despite this challenge to the reader, I recommend this book. It makes for an interesting, intriguing and character-driven read.te has to fit in with language and custom differences.

0525423656|3.0|Trilogies are very, very popular right now . . . but that doesn't necessarily mean they're good!  Ally Condie's MATCHED suffered because of lack of actual story and an over-reliance on internal monologue - there's just so much teenage girl angst I can take in one book.  The sequel, CROSSED, has a better story (more on that in a minute), but now we have alternating viewpoints, which means we get a double-dose of the teenage angst and brooding and poetry-reciting.  Unfortunately, it can be headache-inducing!<br /><br />CROSSED begins just where MATCHED left off - Ky is somewhere in the Outer Provinces, Cassia has been sent to a work camp in Tana Province, and Xander has received his final work assignment in the Center.  Cassia still cares about Xander, but she's in love with Ky.  The first two-thirds of the novel follows Cassia's journey to find him, and his journey to find a group called \\"the farmers\\" who live outside the Society in a mountainous area called the Carving.  Once Cassia and Ky find each other, the focus shifts to the illusive resistance group called the Rising - Cassia is desperate to find it; Ky is desperate not to.  This provides the novel's only real conflict, and it threatens to tear them apart.<br /><br />Condie alternates perspectives in CROSSED between Cassia and Ky.  This isn't a bad technique in theory, since it would give us a break from Cassia's musings.  But in this case it didn't work, because I honestly couldn't tell their voices apart.  That's a problem for a novel that is so entrenched in the inner thoughts of its first-person narrators.  There were times when I literally had to go back and check the chapter heading to see whose perspective I was reading!  Cassia and Ky should not sound alike, but they do.  They're both obsessed with fragments of poetry, the beauty of rocks and mountains, and their own troubling memories.  The feeling I get reading this is that it's Condie's voice we're hearing, rather than either of her central characters.<br /><br />That said, more happens in CROSSED than it does in MATCHED.  There are Enemy attacks (just who IS this Enemy, anyway?), people die, others run for their lives, and the threat of capture by the Society is ever-present.  Condie brings in a few new characters, which add depth to the somewhat tedious romance between Cassia and Ky.  I liked Vick, who helps Ky make his escape into the Carving, and little Eli, who proves a few times how wise a child can be.  Hunter, one of the last of the so-called \\"farmers,\\" helps uncover one of the Society's mysteries, and Indie, who befriends Cassia for reasons of her own, is a courageous and determined character who just might get Xander to stop pining over Cassia (there's only a hint of this in CROSSED, but I expect we'll see more in the final novel).<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a bad novel, but I can't help thinking that the story Condie is telling could have been so much better told in one book (rather than breaking it up into a trilogy).  I know trilogies are all the rage right now, but it's not easy to tell a good story in three parts - inevitably, at least one of them is going to be weak, boring, slow, or worse.  MATCHED wasn't a favorite of mine, but I did like Cassia and I was interested in her story.  I liked CROSSED enough to consider reading the final volume.  But to make the final novel work, Condie is going to have to pick up the pace, do a lot more with the plot, and give us reasons to care whether Cassia ends up with Ky or Xander.  Or . . . and this would be a first for books like this . . . maybe Cassia should end up with Cassia!  Maybe then she could stop looking at life as a journey in search of her soul mate.happens in CROSSED than it does in MATCHED.

B0063IH60K|5.0|game works well, very few glitches if any compared to most games I have played. The action of the cards is snappy and the sounds they make are happy.
B0052GACNM|3.0|Enjoyed this mix, but felt it wasn't quite up to par, in all, with other Duet offerings. \\"Blue Velvet\\" a dud - should have chosen a much more creative song to share with KD Lang.  Otherwise, generally preferred the female duets.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|have a kindle fire was excited to see I could store my favorite music stored. so far not happy with the selection iam given. if you go on youtube normally you get more choices and with this app it brings up everything but your choice. going to see what else I can find something else. just disappointed.

B006OAB3ME|5.0|At first I thought 'oh no,' he's following on the coat-tails of Rod Stewart in doing boring standards now. (I'm still hoping Rod will get back to making good original songs like he used to in the previous century.) But then I remembered, this is the man - Paul McCartney! He's covered I think almost every category of music, but the standards album was missing from his resume so voila now he's got that covered too. What makes this album work is the fact that he covered relatively unknown songs, which is great! So it sounds fresh, it sounds like their his songs. The music is truly outstanding, hats off to Diana Krall. I think now all Paul has left to do is a rap and heavy metal album and there'll be nothing left for him to do! At 69, this creative legend keeps going strong!
B006PHD0RW|1.0|Touchscreen controls were terrible on my Droid X. I've seen similar complaints for other devices. Shame... the game had so much potential!!
0525478817|5.0|Without giving away the plot of the book, I don't care what your age is, buy this book!!!  It is an amazing book about love, sickness, health and what we all can learn from this life.  John Green takes us inside the world of teenage love and illness, friendships and those who leave our sides during it.  It doesn't matter your age, appreciate books like this for what they are, God given talent in paper form.
B004U52VPS|4.0|Great toy good idea the kids love it.  the only gripe I have or a con would be that it only includes the red,yellow , and bomb(black) birds not all of them.  and only a few pigs.  and not enough blocks  we happen to have a bunch of building blocks which makes it more fun.  my 3 year old and 6 year old love it and play for hours.  I even caught my 10,13, and 14 year olds playing with it the other day.  It just doesn't come with enough parts imho...but fun all the same and MOM gets her hostage cell phone back!
B005LAJ1PE|4.0|With \\"Nip/Tuck\\" Ryan Murphy created a television show that supposedly revolved around the lives of two prominent plastic surgeons. The show, however, more often seemed more like a psycho-sexual horror story than it did a medical drama. So it was only logical that, for his next show on F/X (let's not even bring \\"Glee\\" into this conversation, alright?) he would just completely abandon storytelling based on any sort of conventional reality and create a show that exists within the loose, unpredictable, and often absurd genre of horror.<br /><br />The first season of \\"American Horror Story\\" involves a family of three (Psychiatrist/Father/Adulterer Ben, Wife/Mother/Woman-Scorned Vivien, and Daughter/Teenager/Depressive Violet) as they try to make a fresh start in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, they're not aware that the beautiful and suspiciously underpriced house they bought has a history of various murders, suicides, and other brutality, and is haunted by not just one ghost, but a smorgasbord of the living dead (some malevolent, some benign).<br /><br />Although Ben, Vivien, and Violet are the show's supposed main characters, the most important and powerful character on the show is really the house itself. It's made clear throughout the season that the house is its own entity; drawing people to it, driving them to madness, and then containing them once they're dead. (One of the few \\"rules\\" of the show is that anyone who dies on the house's property is doomed to haunt it forever.) Over the years the house had claimed many victims, so the show each week often introduces the viewer to a new character, usually from a distant past, whose tragic fate involves haunting what the neighborhood refers to as \\"the Murder House.\\" Some of the macabre characters who haunt the house include the historical Black Dahlia, a Columbine-esque teenage mass murderer, a modern gay couple, a severely deformed young man, and a housekeeper who appears as a matronly old woman when living women see her and as a naughty temptress when men see her.<br /><br />Every episode of the show is completely over-the-top, filled with all kinds of outrageous plot twists meant to shock, titillate, provoke, and crack up the audience. The show doesn't rely on slow, deliberate character development, subtlety, or nuance. In terms of quality, it's a long way from \\"The Sopranos\\" or \\"Mad Men.\\" What it is: a loud, freaky, kinky, fun and addictive affair. Although for such a campy show, it does include a lot of prestigious talent: Jessica Lange (who won a Golden Globe for her scenery-chewing turn), Dennis O'Hare, Francis Conroy, and Zachary Quinto all add considerable acting chops to the whole deliciously decadent show.and as a naughty temptress when men see her.<br /><br />Every episode of the show is completely over-the-top, filled with all kinds of outrageous plot twists meant to shock, titillate, provoke, and crack up the audience.

B0058VW36U|5.0|Great game and all.  Love it, but really updates are a bid problem right now.  I like the aneroid market, but hey to put updates out as soon as possible like Apple. Inc.  Aneroid service,  don't mean to be a jerk but you could learn a thing or two about them:(  Still giving the game a five star review
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app has everything I'm looking for in an app. Great radar and weather information, don't need to change a thing!!!
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Alright I love the game land all but the free version had more features!!!!  I don't know other made some sort of mistake or something but I am really mad.  Seriously you put more features in the free one that's ridiculous kid if the Halfbrick studio reads this message I would like to say that your making fans mad
B006PHD0RW|1.0|Wussup!?!? Won't open on my Thunderbolt. Will rate higher when i can enjoy on my high end device. Look forward to an update or fix.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game hate u have to play games over and over to get a new one though but not a bad game yo play if you r bored.
B004T5R2HQ|3.0|The app works well and does what it's supposed to do.  Unfortunately, though, the Amazon version has missed several updates that the App Market version has received.  I'd go with the up-to-date version elsewhere.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun game glad you have to earn levels but some of the levels are hard. would recommend to someone who needs a nighttime hobby.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game was interesting, it makes you use your different skills. It is very worth wild. I play this all the time.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|The most fun you could possibly have while bagging groceries...just buy it and get ready for hours of bagging fun
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app may be older random games. but it is a lot of f un if ur bored out of your mind n hve nothing else to do
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I think it's great, you can find specific chapters and verses easier and with the reading to you part, you can listen to while your busy doing something that needs to get done but you still want to read the Bible.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Lots of different modes, enjoyable graphics, and actually challenging to always get three stars. Got as a FAOTD, but would still suggest it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love Evernote for Kindle Fire and the web, but wish Evernote for Android was less green. (But, then, it might just be the version of Android I have on my phone.) UI is simple, inutitive, and clean. Making notes is easy. And I since I love using the app, remembering to write down new story ideas everyday is easy and a pleasurable experience.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the best app to use if you need it on the go. I use it all the time I love this app.

0385342063|3.0|Poppy Wyatt is in full meltdown. First, her priceless emerald engagement ring, an heirloom from her fianc&eacute;'s family, is lost. And almost immediately after, her cell phone is stolen. Not only is she completely incapable of functioning without a cell, how will anyone contact her once the ring is located? As if in answer from the gods, at that very moment Poppy spots a cell phone just lying in a nearby trash bin. Not only is it perfectly functional, it's ringing.<br /><br />That is how Sam Roxton came into Poppy's life less than two weeks before her wedding. She explains to Roxton that when his assistant up and quit her job, chucking the phone, it became fair game--and she needs it. She's already given out the number to everyone on the ring hunt, and she must get the ring back before her fianc&eacute; and his awful parents find out.<br /><br />Yeah, it's a convoluted premise, and trust me, it only gets crazier from there! This is only my second Kinsella novel, having previously read and hated Confessions of a Shopaholic. Unfortunately, Poppy Wyatt is cut from some of the same flawed cloth as that other annoying protagonist. Well, Poppy isn't quite as dreadful, but she's very weak and fairly idiotic through much of the book. Sam Roxton, on the other hand, was a rather appealing counterpart as the lives of these two very different characters became oddly enmeshed in the days leading to Poppy's walk down the aisle.<br /><br />I thought this book was overly long and that parts of it were ridiculously contrived--or just plain ridiculous. And yet... As I got deeper into the novel, the plot began to get more substantive and I became genuinely caught up in the story. Despite the length, the story moved quickly and I read it in no time. And despite the insanely over-the-top ending of the novel, I found myself grinning widely. I can already picture Hugh Grant starring as Sam. (And I'd go to see it. *hangs head in shame*)<br /><br />So, not a glowing recommendation from me, but if you can stand the Shopaholic you'll probably love this one.y love this one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love that it is easy, quick and organized because typing in some of the net is hard on a kindle, but it really needs an easier on the hands way to type.

B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this game.  Play it all the time. Wish there were more games like this.  It is very addictive,  but so much fun.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Great movie!  Quite graphic at times, but still awesome.  Ryan Gosling should've gotten an Oscar nod for this one.  A very refreshing film with a great sound track as well.
0345529057|1.0|This series stands on its own as to whether the buyer likes the work or not, so this is not a critique of the author.  My gripe is the poor quality of the printing and binding for the \\"mass market paperback edition\\".  The print drove my eyes nuts...poor print quality and terrible contrast on the page. The binding is also of flimsy quality and will not stand the test of time.  I am very disappointed with Bantam Publishing.
B003WJRW2U|2.0|This book has a couple of major problems.  The first is the authors do not have the common courtesy of keeping their cursing to themselves.  Specifically, they use WTF several times in the book.  This is not appropriate for a general audience book that might be used by younger students (Ms. Peabody, what does WTF mean?)  Unlike SNAFU (situation normal, all fouled up), WTF has no \\"clean\\" definition.  Second, they have good graphics presenting various page element placements but do not provide the relevent code that matches the page element graphic.  This makes the book less useful than it could be.  Overall, the book is more difficult than it would be.  Overall, this is the wrong book for younger and less experienced people.  (Note, I am neither.)
0312370849|5.0|very intersting read, and much more informative than the movie,  it was hard to put the book down,and so sad that things like that did happen..
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. It works great on my Fire. Always nice to find a fun new game.
B00074CBIS|1.0|I love this movie but never had it as my own. Then I saw it for a great price I decied to get it. The order said from Jan 20-Feb 6. I waited and nothing came my way. I couldnt even call UPS because this seller did not give me a tracking number. I will NOT by from this seller again.
0061714402|5.0|What a book this was!!!  This is definitely for metalheads.  If you've ever seen Megadeth's \\"VH1 Behind The Music\\", this is it but in much greater depth.  My title says it all.  From growing up in a tough environment, to playing in Metallica, to selling drugs, to meeting 'Junior' , to starting Megadeth and so on. You'll get the inside info on his short stint in Metallica and how bad it hurts him to this day.  This is the best book I've ever read.  Too bad they didn't let us read stuff like this in school:)  I read this book in 3 days and i have the attention span of a 5 year old.  Mustaine rules.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|i loved it and enjoyed it. Kristen stewart looks great again in this film and even better in my opinion than the last one. Pluse the honeymoon scenes get a little steamy since girls think edward is sexy and guys think kristen is sexy, it appeals to both sexes. I thought there were however a few corny or cheesy parts that were a little weird, but I mean this is a sci fi film so it's rather fitting in a way. I loved the plot, storyline, and suspense from beginning to end. And I am one who can't stand suspense lol. ANyway I loved it and can't wait for part 2! Godbless<br /><br />~shauns movie review
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. It kept me, my husband,  and my six year old entertained. Its easy to play and challenging enough to keep you playing.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|WTF. How on earth do you play a game with NO instructions and NO help function. I had NO idea how to even start!!!! No idea what the purpose is or what I was supposed to do. LAME.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|When I saw this movie in theaters, I knew I would be adding this to my collection. But I soon realized that this movie alone is not enough to help one understand how Important to be a father. I highly recommend this movie, and the book(s) that goes along with it: The Resolution for Men (if female: The Resolution for Women).  The movie has a powerful message, and it is evident in the lives of many men and women in our great nation.  \\"As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord\\" --Joshua 24:15

141694740X|5.0|This book is an eye opener.  Makes me think that none of the relationships I've ever had were worth a hill of beans.  So then it makes me wonder what is wrong with me that I can't find love?  It has made me even more unsure of dating
B004PHE9F6|5.0|Always loved this movie, it's sublime in HD... it actually makes you think about what's important if life in many ways, why does the ego, the need for excitement and fame drive many of us to do what we do? One of the best Blu-ray transfers yet with only a few areas where the frames show damage.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Perfect for Kindle Fire. Works flawlessly, and well deserves a 5 star rating from those who are interested in fun apps like this one. Enough said, I would recommend this for anyone!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great variety and fun to play anytime whether @ work or home. Some can be a little nervewracking but it poses a challenge which I enjoy. Definitely worth the download.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|wife and I use it for so much. keeps all of our lists in sync. taking notes on the road. works perfect on my kindle fire too!
0062059882|2.0|I read this book because both my sister in law and my nephew raved about it but I've never been so bored in my life.  Lot of movement in the book but nothing happens and in the end you feel as if you've just wasted your time.  There are better books out there.
0307959856|2.0|Boring, I kept waiting for ANYTHING to happen:(  Big Jane Austin fan and thank heavens she doesn't have to read this.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Just listened all the way through, and I don't get what all the criticism is about.  It's exceptionally tasteful - considerately chosen songs (very few \\"usual suspects\\"), two fantastic originals (Stevie Wonder's harmonica accompaniment on \\"Only Our Hearts\\" is signature), Paul's vintage vocals front and center, spare and mature arrangements throughout, and Diana Krall's top-notch band underneath it all.<br /><br />Unlike the recent series of Rod Stewart songbook atrocities, there's nothing gimmicky here, and very little schmaltz.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I picked this app up after trying it out. I can get lost in it for hours and not be bored with it. It's a relaxing way to spend the time.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I was really enjoying my books until the new update. I cant get into kindle. Seems like amazon dont care that so many people are having the same problem! Help!! I feel like I wasted money on books I can't read
B006UG90RM|4.0|I think fans of the real Van Halen (that's right, anything without David Lee Roth is not the real VH so get used to it) were understandably a little worried that this album wouldn't stack up. My oh my did Van Halen prove us wrong. Edward VH is in fine form for the first time in well, a long time. As for Roth the bottom line is he sounds great and was clearly motivated by this possible last go round with the VH brothers. Roth is in full command of his vocals and his lyrics are as humorous and clever as ever. Alex VH also benefits from Roth's return and is inspired to give one of his best recorded performances. Wolfgang VH plays very well and truth be told you won't miss M Anthony. The background vocals are done well and the real VH were never a chorus band anyway. Only the idiots from the Hagar clan would complain. The one recurring thought I had when listening to this album was that Eddie & Alex VH (particularly Edward) are motivated by Roth in a way that they simply aren't by any other singer. The same could be said vice versa but it comes across strongest in the way the VH brothers play when Roth is commanding the mic and the stage. Some singers/frontmen were just meant to front certain bands. With Van Halen it simply comes down to the fact that if David Lee Roth isn't out front it just doesn't feel right, look right, or most importantly sound right. A Different Kind Of Truth sounds right. Van Halen are on fire. No power ballads, no keyboards littering the proceedings, and no lyrics about man's search for everlasting love. What you do get is balls to the wall hard rock with the ever charismatic Roth conducting the onslaught. This may be VH's last album, or their last with Roth which renders it their last real album anyway. I can't think of a better way to go out.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|game was ehh.... some parts were fun others were a chore.  most of the reason I kept playing was was just to try all of the games
B000SJJCX4|2.0|I bought this for my pedal board for my side project band. It works OK and has useful features. However, replacing the battery is a bit dodgy. You have to push in the two plastic pivot pins for the stomp part of the pedal and completely remove it to get to the battery. This seems to be destined to fail if you use it as a battery only device. Fortunately I use an out board power supply!<br /> It also takes a bit of time to start tracking, so on the fly tuning can be somewhat bothersome.<br /> Overall, I wouldn't want to depend on it for my main stage tuner over a long period of time, and I would definitely replace it with a more dependable Tuner if it broke.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game has a smooth learning curve. After level 20 it becomes challenging, and after level 30 it becomes very difficult.

B000SM7QUC|5.0|Wow, what a nice collection of well written, well executed tracks.  Totally out of left field considering this is coming from the musical mind behind Motley Crue!  Sixx has crated some very tasty tunes built around his battles with addition.  Like the book of the same name this record is dark but ultimately a rewarding listen.    Well Done  Sixx!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|The icon is a bit cheesy with the hearts and all but this is one of the best casual games I've downloaded from Amazon. I like how the different game modes, while they have the same controls, are quite different and each challenging in its own way.
1416511946|5.0|What an amazing read!  Believe me this is not an easy read, it's sometimes hard to believe that people can treat other or themselves like what is portrayed in this book.  Sixx shares with us the insight (lucid and sometimes not quite) into his life for a year in his life (1987).  The last few pages make this book redeeming as Sixx ultimately proves himself to be able to overcome the demons that nearly killed him!  If not for those last few pages this would be an agonizing tale of addiction and wasted talent...  Bravo to Sixx for being braze enough to share with us all.
0670022705|2.0|everyone in the world could come up with a list. that is what the problem is with this book.  the title sounds intriguing, but if the items that the British Museum chose aren't ones you find interesting then its a frustrating read.  Nice idea though, but not worth purchasing.  It was a good over the weekend library book.

B005L38QK2|2.0|My measurements:  longest length: 4.94 in (125mm)  widest width (at the bottom flare out): 2.69in (68mm)  height of hump: 1.38 in (35 mm)  I can't speak much for the comfort of the mouse, the hump did not seem to match my rather medium size hand when I tried to palm it and I don't understand claw griping mice that flare at the front, but I'm told people are happy on both these counts and I'm sure it is true.  I found when attempting to keep my palm on the mouse I could not avoid wobble, and had to maintain some all finger grip instead.  Doing this I found the feel OK, but always just a little awkward in my hand, with pointer finger on left mouse button and middle and ring on right.  This positioning of fingers did however leave my pinky fairly free to get the right side buttons.  Buttons themselves are pretty good.  Side buttons have sufficient area and are just out of the mouse enough to hit, but not to protrude.  They click in with little effort which is a great plus in my opinion (notably very absent from Corsair's new M90).  The DPI switch button seems to be made of similar stock.  Wheel scrolls nicely and clicks accurately with just the amount of force I like in a middle click.  Left and right buttons have a very consistent feel through the click, but resist somewhat more than I would like them too, which is not great as they are the main buttons.  I don't believe it to be the fault of the omrons either as my cm storm spawn has those and clicks quite pleasantly lighter.  The mouse itself is pretty light though especially for it's size so if it fits your grip this stands to be a plus.  Detracting from this however is among the stiffest of mouse cable I have yet encountered and I have encountered a great deal.  Final point on the hardware is the teflon pads is when the mouse is held such that wobble is eliminated, they provide very nice gliding for the mouse, so I can't fault that positioning.  Onto the software, it's very much Diablo themed, which is kind of cool at first, but in honesty just appeared to make the software a lot harder to use than it might have been. Also, and the main fault on the mouse in my opinion, despite what the steelseries product page would have you believe there is no freemove setting/option to turn off smoothing/acceleration on this mouse.  I had the constant feeling that it was on and there was nothing I could do about it, though perhaps I'm just used to mice that track in other ways.  My control definitely felt less fine to me though.  The lift off distance also seems closer to 2.5mm to the 1 mentioned with no way to adjust.  Double click speed and scroll speed settings also seem not to be present in the driver software.  Appearence of the physical mouse is actually well done and if you want something to go with your D3 in mouse form you will be pleased.  Personally, the notably missing drive settings, too stiff cable, and consistently awkward feel (and lets be honest, it's a pretty standard mouse shape, it's time for steelseries to own up and stop making the claim it's \\"ergonomic\\") in my hand make it quite a no go for me.

1402785305|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.<br /><br />And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...<br /><br />Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).<br /><br />The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.<br /><br />But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").<br /><br />It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read.ongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

B0058YPGL6|4.0|Urban fantasy series are currently undergoing a boom -- anything with vampires, werewolves and the like has an automatic audience.<br /><br />Enter \\"Teen Wolf,\\" which seems to be the lycanthropic counterpart to the \\"Vampire Diaries\\" -- lots of attractive teenage characters, secrets, violence, supernatural mysteries and some high-school romance. While the main character's werewolf form is incredibly unscary, the rest of the series is quite strong -- even if it does seem to use lycanthropy as a metaphor for puberty.<br /><br />Weedy teenager Scott McCall (Tyler Posey) and his nerdy buddy Stiles (Dylan O'Brien) are prowling through a woods where a murder has recently occurred, and a large furry animal bites Scott. The following day, he finds that he's gained incredible senses, healing and agility -- which allows him to become the new star of the lacrosse team.<br /><br />Stiles claims Scott is a werewolf, but Scott ignores him... until he starts transforming in the middle of a date with a new girl in town, Allison (Crystal Reed). Another werewolf, Derek Hale (Tyler Hoechlin) takes Scott under his wing to educate him about how to control his lycanthropic urges, since anything that raises his heart rate can transform him at a moment's notice.<br /><br />Even worse: there are an ancient family of werewolf hunters in the area, and it turns out that Allison's dad and sadistic aunt are among them. Also, jock Jackson (Colton Haynes) is sniffing out Scott's secret.<br /><br />But Scott's high school woes soon become the least of his troubles. He was turned into a werewolf by an alpha -- a savage, bloodthirsty creature who is killing more people around the town. And somehow this rampage is connected to a fire that killed Derek's entire family several years ago. And if Scott doesn't join the alpha, the lives of everyone he loves will be endangered...<br /><br />\\"Teen Wolf\\" hits a solid balance of teen romance, dark action, gore, horror and dry comedy. It's hard to get all those elements in the right proportions, but for the most part the series gets it right. The only problem is that a few episodes are a little too heavy on the teen soap opera romance (oh noes! Scott is making out with Jackson's girlfriend whom Stiles is also crushing on! ANGST! DRAMA!).<br /><br />But when the focus is on the werewolf stuff, \\"Teen Wolf\\" shines -- there's lots of growling, misty woods, and bloody violence, and the writers throw some curveballs at the audience (just who/what IS that vet?!). There's also an atmosphere of growing tension and darkness, which grows stronger as the season unfolds. Fortunately, the writers know how to leaven the story with plenty of humor, usually from Stiles (\\"What did I sound like to you?\\" \\"Like a cat being choked to death\\").<br /><br />The special effects are a little dodgy. Some of them (like the alpha werewolf form) are decent, but the CGI werewolf maws are sometimes goofy-looking -- and the beta werewolf form is not scary AT ALL.<br /><br />The cast is pretty uniformly solid -- even seemingly-cliched characters like Lydia (the Queen Bee/Mean Girl), Chris Argent (Allison's scary werewolf-hunter dad) and Jackson (the arrogant jock who desperately wants to be a werewolf) are well-rounded, with excellent reasons for them to act and feel as they do. Posey, Hoechlin and O'Brien make a solid central trio as the earnest good boy, the tall-dark-and-brooding bad boy, and the nerdy sidekick respectively, and they all have excellent chemistry.<br /><br />\\"Teen Wolf\\" has a few freshman wobbles, but overall it's a sleek, eerie story that balances action, romance and horror in equal measure.

B0069UP2PI|4.0|Mix one part Traffic with one part Outbreak, mix for 104 minutes and you'll get Contagion.  How in the world did they collect this many boom actors and actresses? Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Lawrence Fishburne, John Hawkes, Chin Han, and Sanaa Lathan. This is the ultimate cast where you'll spend more time trying to figure out where you've seen these actors instead of following the many plots.  Paltrow brings an ugly virus back to her home after spending some time in Asia. This virus has an extremely high mortality rate and has no vaccine.  With the fears surrounding Bird Flu and Swine Flu, this movie strikes a sensitive nerve. The first two-thirds of this film are fantastic. Kate Winslet is the point person in order to set up the response to the pandemic. However, once her character story leaves the film, the movie goes into a comatose-like state.  Jude Law is a blogger, with twelve million followers, who thinks the government is keeping the cure from us and pushes a homeopathic treatment.  Damon is Paltrow's husband who, someone, is immune.  Good luck keeping up with the multiple stories. Even the writers of the film left many holes unattended or answered.  You will feel a little ill after watching this film. It's just like talking about lice and then feeling like you have to scratch your head.  Watch the first part of this movie for intriguing storytelling then finish it while reading a book.
B0073PZIYI|2.0|Two stars for a nice concept. horrible acting, corny, cliche, and anticlimactic writing. overall lackluster. the graphics were also comical...low budget to the extreme.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|What an amazing voice. I am an admirer of female vocalists and I have a new favorite. I loved some of the songs, liked a few, and there are three I didn't really get into BUT 9 out of 12 is very strong don't you agree? In an age of one hit wonders made business' like Itunes a success with the ability to buy just the song you liked and not have to waste your coin on a CD finding an album worth buying is rare and a blessing.  And at $6-$9 it's well worth the price. I'd skip the deluxe and stick to the regular album. I sampled the deluxe here on Amazon and the three extra songs were weak in my humble opinion. In her defense the three songs I didn't dig were all geared towards women. I'm a man and didn't really get their message nor was I supposed to I don't think. So here is my star rating of each song 5 stars goes to Born to Die, Blue jeans, Radio and Summertime Sadness.4 stars to Video Games and Diet Mountain Dew. 3 stars to National Anthem and Dark Paradise. 2 stars to the remaining four songs. Now this isn't like rating a movie so 2 stars doesn't mean they sucked just ok. 3 stars means I liked them, 4 stars really liked and 5 stars were amazing tracks. BUY IT
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Yea so I wasn't planning on writing a review for this movie, but after seeing how many mindless people are giving this a 1-star rating(for no good reason) I felt like I had to.  To be more clear, people were expecting Fast and Furious and instead they got something with more substance, which is obviously not what they're looking for.  Drive is a great movie. It's my favorite Ryan Gosling movie. It's subtle, it's intense, it makes you care a little about every character, or at least let's you understand why they do what they do. The music is great, with California beach-type songs, which manage to fit perfectly with the mood of the movie.  THE MOVIE IS SHOCKING, THERE WILL BE BLOOD AND GORE, IT IS RATED-RRRRRRRRRRRRRR  I can't believe I have to make that clear for the people who don't bother to read the rating on a movie before they start complaining about blood.

Applying the 80/20 principle to my workouts has really cut down on my gym time and I've seen pretty much the same result as from when I was spending an hour and a half to two hours in the gym. That along with the slow-carb diet has really worked for me. The one cheat day is probably the only thing I'm not super strict on, I actually have cheat weekends and I've still seen great results. For me I just apply the slow-carb diet M-F, then after 4pm Friday I eat and drink what I want and still experience weight loss.

If you like having another person's ideals shoved down your throat for over an hour you'll probably like this, if not, you'll probably be in pain 90% of the time. Cliche, cliche, cliche. Bad boy meets hot good girl, they fall in love and she wears high heels EVERYWHERE. Little explanation given on anything, but who needs explanation when your main point is to make a point? This movie falls into the same trap that a lot of religious entertainment does, the creator is so focused on making a point they forget to entertain, or make sense at that.
0439023491|4.0|I know from experience that writing a middle book in a trilogy is tough. You want to engage the reader at the same level that you did in the first book, but you also need to save some of the good stuff for the finale. You also want to be original enough that the readers know this is new book, but you also need to retread some, or the book won't feel like it is part of the same series. It is a balancing act. The hope is to advance the story. To be closer to \\"The Empire Strike Back\\" then, say, \\"Jaws 2\\".<br /><br />With that in mind, I really wondered where \\"Catching Fire\\" was going to go. The first book had a wonderfully crafted plotline. Very straightforward. With the actual Hunger Games and the conclusion of those Games being the plot's climax and resolution. So what would the author do now?<br /><br />Find a way to get the characters into similar situations as the first book, of course!<br />I was torn on that solution at first. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed everything up until that plot turn, I wondered if we were now drifting into \\"Jaws 2\\" territory. Was this going to be just a rehash? Would the overall story advance?<br /><br />Having finished, though, I've have to say \\"Yes!\\" The author straddled the line, but she ended up making \\"Catching Fire\\" a remarkably enthralling, original (yet reminiscent) middle book. I commend her for that, and recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first book. Well worth the money! I also appreciate that one of the things I questioned from the first book was clarified in this one. Well done.<br /><br />I do have one caveat on the series so far, though. It seems to me that what has been crafted here is a future America without any belief system. Yet there is no explanation for that, nor even remnants of anything faith-related. I find that odd, because the characters (especially while participating in the Games) have to deal with deep issues like life and death, yet there is never any mention of what life and death mean...or whether there is life after death. You'd think someone in the book would wrestle with those questions. Even in a vague way.<br /><br />Also, many of the characters live in remarkably moral ways, yet there is no reason given for this. You'd think in a society where everyone is scraping to survive, where there are routinely games to the death, that there would be more graft outside the games. And given that people behave honorably outside the games, why do they suddenly become cold-blooded murderers within it? Why does no one play the part of a Christian in the Coliseum and just refuse to play? Or everyone?<br /><br />I'm doubtless overthinking it all, though. I look forward to the finale.

I'm a gamer that has the PS3, xBox 360, Wii, and PSP, so I get a little skeptical when it comes to what you call \\"game\\" apps.  This one takes all the negative thoughts away.  Great game play- great graphics... I would pay for it if it wasn't free!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|most games are a lot of fun! some are hard to complete on a tablet, maybe would be better with a mouse!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game and easy to play on the Kindle Fire! Lots of fun for Solitaire players and I like that it gives you the option to have a game automatically completed when all cards are on the board and just being moved to the 4 top stacks. Game also has lots of set up options
B0054JZC6E|3.0|game are quick and easy....but be careful not to click on an ad they put them in places you unconsciously click
1603425381|5.0|This book is easy to understand.  The color photos are great.  The front of the book has simple instructions on how to understand the other instructions.  After you give the first few pages a quick once over, you are ready to make any of the 150 borders.  I think this book is a must have for any crocheter.

B000000OAH|5.0|Queen had really been an important link between the glam and art rock of the early/mid 70's in England. Both sort of separate until Queen bought it to the forefront. It had a lot to do with Brian May's and Freddie Mercury's love of theater and story telling both musically and thematically. However,even if your THE most \\"progressive\\" rock band out there,there are certain limits even in the theatrical high drama and camp. Never mind at this point many people still hadn't picked up on the fact this bands very name was (by today's standards) a very obvious gay reference. So things were moving on since Queen were charging out one rock guitar hero type anthem after another with \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\",\\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are The Champions\\"....well both the latter tunes were showcases of the previous release [[ASIN:B000000OAC News of the World]] anyway. It seemed the band were getting interested in pursuing the possibilities of grooves in their music. But they weren't quite through with their rock n roll theater send up yet. So this would end up being a transitional album.<br /><br />  Now this album right off the bat contains four more \\"theater rock\\" type numbers from Queen. Two of which were big hits in the lusty and loud \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" along with the more implicit and dramatic \\"Bicycle Race\\". Mercury really lets the East Indian aspect of his growing up come out with with \\"Mustapha\\",which really lets the Eastern chords fly,as he lapses into what sounds like Hindi and even begins speaking of Allah. All the same some of the other rockers such as \\"If You Can't Beat Them\\",\\"Let Me Entertain You\\" and \\"Dead On Time\\" showcase a surrendering of ego to a degree,with a leaner and less dramatic sound emerging and more resigned lyric themes. \\"Dead On Time\\" does indeed have a louder sound,but a groove of a somewhat hard jazz-rock sound emerges too. On \\"Jealousy\\",\\"In Only Seven Days\\" as well as the almost folksy shuffles of \\"Dreamers Ball\\" and the melancholy \\"Leaving Home Ain't Easy\\" find a smoother,more pop radio friendly ballad style. On \\"Fun It\\"..well you might think on in the early 80's but your not: this song is rhythmically based on what sounds like a primitive drum percussive device. Or it could be some early gating technology on the sleek dance/funk number.<br /><br />  \\"Don't Blame Me\\" is one of the most pure pop,almost Billy Joel sounding number here where \\"More Of That Jazz\\" kind of throws together a medley of the bands hits from this album. Of the bonuses the remix of \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" is somewhat interesting to me but NOTHING like the funky hip-hop re-imagining by Junior Vasquez of \\"Bicycle Race\\". The songs melodies and refrains are resequenced with a heavy groove. And that's appropriate since this album showcases Queen transitioning from one period of their musical development to another. True this would by no means be the end of Queen as a hard rocking band. It's just the WAY they'd rock in the future would be quite different. Not only that it did has some new rhythmic sugar and spice to what they did. As Stevie Wonder once said \\"just because a record has a groove don't make it in the groove\\". Queen had always had some type of groove going for them but they wouldn't really start to be In the groove until this album. Because of their excellent songwriting and musicianship this was something they'd be able to do a lot with in the future. Because it is very transitional,this album might mean different things to different people. But it's more than worth it anyway.nd a smoother,more pop radio friendly ballad style.

B003274QH6|5.0|Even though the show is on AMC which prevents then producers from showing scenes thay normally would; this is the best made show ever produced. Most people would say The Sopranos, The Wire, or even Arrested Development but Breaking Bad is by far the best show from front to back and it still has one season left. It doesn't have high viewer ratings but it is a quality show that everyone should see. AMC has been making some great shows for sometime now including Mad Men, The Killing, The Walking Dead, and there best show Breaking Bad. Buy This! In Blu-Ray!
B0071QIN00|1.0|I loved the first, it had a couple quirks, but is a great game. This is straight crap. I can press the accelerator and it will work then stop, or act like I am running out of fuel. You can do a wheelie end up on your back and sometimes roll over backwards and be upright again. Just appears to be a attempt to cash in on prior success with a lousy sequel. HTC Thunderbolt.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I'm wondering why it's the girl with the dragon tattoo who's in the title role.  Also, why the dragon tattoo and not her other tattoos and markings?  I'll probably find out the reason why in the next Millennium books...<br /><br />I applaud the way the story was woven around the mystery clouding the Vanger family.  Honestly, I got bored at the start.  If not for a number of my friends who've read the series, who swore that they're really good reads, and are still all excited about it, I would have most probably quit reading it after just a couple of chapters; and I wouldn't be writing this review.  I also do not like the way it ended; but since it's just the first book in the series, redemption may be in the second or third book.<br /><br />Overall it's worth 3.5 stars for me.  For those who have not read it yet and are planning to, plow through the initial boring parts; it'll get better.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Honestly I love the service. I think its great. But the direction that you are taking with these permissions is very worrying. I cant see a reason for half these perm's, much less my contacts or where I live. There is no acceptable reason for you to have this. I wont be using this product any more until this is resolved.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|In a world of broken families and abandoned children, this movie is a must see! Especially for those of faith! I bought several and gave them away. Every parent should see this movie.  Every church member will be challenged to step up to be courageous in the lives of our own families, as well as those broken children who have no one to stand with them!

B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a fun addictive game. Played it for a couple of hours couldn't put it down. No glitches or fc. Glad I got it for the FAOTD. But after playing it I would pay for it.
0525423281|4.0|Prepare to be surprised, because I know I was.  Regular readers of my blog kinw that this book was stepping way out of my typical reading zone, but I really liked it.  I was at a point where I had enough dark depressing books and I wanted something a little lighter and how could a book about a girl named Lola not be cheerful?  I did have my issues with this book.  Once again the dastardly YA love triangle rears it's ugly head.  There needs to be a anti love triangle logo.  Like a triangle with a with a slash through it.  I'm sure one of you awesome graphic designer would come up with something fantastic.  Lola is also saddled with a kinda gross boyfriend in the beginning.  She started dating him when she was 16 and he was 22...so that's a little pervy right there and he's jealous and possessive.  I will say I approved of the presence of actual parents in this book.  They are two dads of which I'm sure some will object, but they act like real life, normal parents.  In the end, I really liked this book.  I thought it was a cute story.  Good lessons learned and all that fun stuff.  There was a little bit of language and a few mild sexual references, but nothing really out of line, so it doesn't really need a big parental warning label on it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|alright game kill some time had a lot of fun for what it was worth. like the challenge of opening all the games. very challenging for how simple it is.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I have been waiting for this album for a long time and it rocks!  It's classic VH and most of it is heavy, which I love.  Eddie is playing better than ever and is still my favorite guitar player of all time.  Anyone reading this review should definitely buy the CD if you like rock music.  It's funny that \\"Tattoo\\" was released as  the first single because it's my least favorite song on the album, but I do like it too!  As for the people on here (especially the supposed VH fans) that give it 1 or 2 stars, you have some serious issues.  If this music doesn't move you and rock your world, I would check for a pulse.  Rock on!!!

B004BLTNJI|5.0|I missed this movie when it played in the theaters and now I bought the DVD to enjoy it in 3D in my Sony 3D Personal Viewer & Panasonic 3D Blu Ray player.  I am not sure why other reviewers had a problem with the 3D.  It plays well in my unit.  The movie itself is very original and highly engaging. I agree that it is a bit scary and might not go well with younger children.  Still, it is a 3d treat, IMO, especially considering that it is not computer generated but it is based or real puppets and stop motion filming.  Make sure you watch the special sections on how the movie was made. It is really mind boggling that this thing is even possible.  All things considered, this is an amazing movie, a worthy addition in al 3d movie enthusiasts!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app daily. Its a good app. The notes feature is great and the number of verisons is incredible. When listening to a the app you sometimes have to reset to get the next chapter. Other than that its a GREAT app!!!!

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|It is shipped very fast. In addition, it is cheap enough for all of us. It is easy to cover it on Kindle Fire.
1451627289|5.0|What might have happened if Kennedy hadn't died in Dallas?  That is what part of this book is all about, but it is also about relationships, doubt, persistence, and doing \\"the right thing.\\"  This is the most mature book King has ever written.  No supernatural monsters, no supernatural horror, just a portal to the past.  Everything else was realistic.  Read it even if you aren't a King fan.  It ranks right up there with Duma Key, and Insomnia in its maturity.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|awesome app this is convienent and I can take the Bible anyplace. This is growing technology that can be used all the time l, in addition light weight.

0785132619|5.0|Like a a lot of people I had seen the movie before reading the comic and thought it would be redundant but that was nicely far from the truth. It's very similar to the movie but there were enough differences to keep me engaged. Tale is about a high school kid who becomes an actual superhero but finds himself mostly getting beat up as he tries to protect people. His first incident is so bad he ends up in the E.R. But somehow he keeps going and inspires other people to later become superheroes and there's this craze that takes place. Just like the movie there's a lot of gore and swearing but unlike the movie this one has some explicit sex scenes. The ending for the love story is far more vague and tragic than in the film. The artwork had some nice touches. I was quite impressed the comic drew me in even after I had seen the movie. Most novels couldn't make that claim. STORY/PLOTTING: B plus to A minus; ARTWORK: A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; WHEN READ: mid February 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.

B000WBZ5M0|5.0|I once heard George Clooney say that he does movies like the \\"Ocean's\\" to enable him to do films like \\"Good Night and Good Luck,\\" etc.  What makes him even more admirable is the quality of the former.  All of the Ocean's films are smart, classy, clever and highly entertaining.  While \\"Ocean's 12\\" wasn't quite as sharp as \\"11,\\" the group is back in form for \\"Ocean's 13.\\"  All of the original characters are back (except for Julia Roberts), and this time Al Pacino and Ellen Barkin are in the mix.  Both enter the mix well, retaining their own power.  Matt Damon enjoys a larger piece of this story and his performance is wonderful.<br /><br />As a 60's child, I saw the original Frank Sinatra/Dean Martin et al \\"Ocean's 11\\" when I was a kid. Although I was much too young to appreciate their musical gifts, I knew they were a big deal.  Their gift for making the audience feel like they were part of the secret has been replicated in the Clooney versions, which accounts for a lot of the success of these films.  The characters are charming, the plot lines clever and the overall experience is fun.  I have to think Frank would be pleased with these new incarnations!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is awesome for free but it is totaly worth it for $0.99 love it great puzzle .Good Bye
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|First, let me say that the performances are outstanding.  I was impressed across the board, but if Octavia Spencer doesn't win the Academy Award, let there be pitchforks outside the Kodak Theatre!<br /><br />Now, for what I didn't like:  it's yet ANOTHER story about how a white person saved the day for a group of oppressed black people.  I appreciate the context of the times, etc., but I hate that the story had the maids empowered by a white teenager.  Skeeter may be merely the vehicle used to tell the story of what it was like for domestic workers in those times, but I think it's demoralizing for young black people today to be exposed over and over again to the concept that without white intervention, black has no hope.  Another example would the \\"The Blind Side.\\"  It's a great movie with great performances, and despite that it's a true story, it fosters that notion that a white person is needed for a black person's success and that black people don't take care of their own.<br /><br />I work for a public housing agency and each day I see people struggling to grasp hope.  So many big movies either deny this or reinforce it.<br /><br />So, for the performances, I say \\"GREAT film.\\"  For the plot, I say \\"Hollywood, do more black success stories, with those successes due to the efforts of the people themselves.\\"

B0063FGFEG|5.0|One of the best movies ever made.  If you don't think so you are so stupid there is nothing to compare you to.  You don't see the treasure right under your feet.  In all seriouness, this is indeed one of the greats.  I have loved this flick since I was a kid.  Can you help a fellow American to more great flicks?

B0050DIWFC|5.0|The other reviewers have excellent plot summaries. What I want to say about the book is that it will continue to make you think, to make you feel, to make you question what you would do in a similar situation.  I am often fascinated by what drives us to do extreme things- and many characters in this book do go to extremes.  When it comes to our families, we all have panic buttons that when pressed will cause us to act in ways we never imagined.  Furthermore, the book makes you realize that life as we know it can change in the blink of an eye.  I will never forget this book, especially the ending.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Love the silly characters and it can get challenging! Really cute and love the faces they make when they are going to crush!
B004V2AWKG|3.0|The Giver was an alright dystopian at best. The book itself is an easy read and considered a middle-school level read. For an adult, this is a quick and easy read. The novel itself is short and leaves the reader on a cliff hanger of what is to come in other novels. The book is no more, than an introductory for people those who want to get into the genre of stories and novels under dystopia. At best, this book will hook you at first, but to reread this simple novel is not worth the trouble. It is a good one shot read and a good start for late readers who are starting to read in middle school at the grade level of seventh or eighth grade.
0525423656|3.0|Audio read.  This book picks up right where Matched ended. Cassia is disillusioned by the Society that claims to have all of their best interests in the forefront. She realizes that the Society have the opposite in mind and have very specific goals which do not involve the welfare of its citizens. Ky has been sent to a work camp which is really a war zone where he is to pretend he is a farmer and is bombed every night. Cassia in her attempt to find Ky asks her parents to send her to work detail, a punishment for out of control teens, in hopes of running into Ky. Long story short they do find one another and engage on a journey to find The Rising, individuals who are in war with the Society. We do see Zander in this book and new characters are introduced in this book such as Eli the thirteen year old orphan who has been sent to the war zone, Indie a rebel teen, Vick who fell in love with an Aboration, and Hunter a farmer who was part of the Rising but stayed behind to care for his dying daughter.  This book was different in that it was told from both Cassia's and Ky's perspectives. Each chapter alternating between the two. I liked this aspect of the book. The story is still an interesting one but I liked the first book much better than the second. Although there were parts to the book that added to the mystery of the Society and helped develop the story further, they came far and inbetween and overall the book dragged. The majority of the words were repeats from the first book and just didn't add anything more to this book. I did find myself saying \\"let's get on with it already\\". Unfortunately, because Cassia and Ky were constantly on the move it was hard for them to really sit down and talk. Cassia felt that Ky was keeping parts of him to himself and in his point of view he admitted to doing so because to give all of himself would be ammunition and even though he trusted Cassia it was hard to get out of that habit. Remember Ky has always been an outsider, not reallywanted but tolerated because the Society felt they owed the Markham family a son due to the loss of their only child.  In the end Cassia, Ky, and Indie reach The Rising. Ky doesn't trust The Rising and frankly neither do I. Cassia is a Rising informant who has been placed right back into The Society. Ky and Indie are pilots in training. Cassia and Ky are apart once more.  We will see what happens in the next installment of the series which is meant to be the last. I am curious to see how the author wraps this up and if she will do it as nicely and intriguing as it all began.

1416914285|3.0|Ooook... with all the hype surrounding this series I thought I would bump it up on my TBR list and finally read it.  Clary Fray has been a normal human girl for almost 15 years until she finds out that she is not. She is half human/half angel. This book is mostly about how she comes to find out the truth about her past and how certain events led to her mother keeping these truths a secret from her.  I think this wraps it up nicely. :-)  Cassandra Clare did a good job in creating an interesting world with potential for more growth. What I think she could have done was to spend more time in developing her characters more and working through her scenes a bit more so that they made more sense.  I liked Clary but I didn't think she was all that special or interesting. There were moments where I think the author could have written her to be more special and interesting but she cut it short every time. I don't know if the author was hoping to build some mystery to Clary so that she can give us an AHA moment later in another book but whatever it is it didn't work. Clary was just Clary... rather blah.  Jace. Oh Jace. Why oh why Jace? I seriously don't understand the appeal. I mean there are tons of people out there on the internet drooling over this guy and I'm stumped as to why. First of all this guy is a total jerk. I mean there is nothing lovable about him. I mean NOTHING. When he shows concern for Clary it's more out of duty than that he is falling for her. Which is why when they have their kissing scene it didn't seem natural to me. It just didn't sorry. I do worry that girls out there will think behavior like this is ok. It's not girlies. In fact when guys are jerks it gets old real fast. That's why perhaps I wasn't as tolerant of his behavior in this book.  I liked the other characters just fine. They all needed more character development but were ok for the moment. Valentine, the EVIL ONE, is a douche bag but didn't seem very scary to me.  There is no doubt that thisbook was full of action. From the beginning it kicks off with some drama. However, I read this via audio book and it took me longer than I would have liked to get through the book. I found myself listening to parts and having to go back to re-read those parts to make sense of it. It was they way she wrote the scenes that it was hard to follow all of the action that took place.  As interesting as this world was it was equally if not more predictable...(Well except for Alec. I didn't see that coming or I just didn't pay as much attention to him.) Like the big cliffhanger...I was calling that half way through the book. ALL OF IT! I didn't even mind it when it all unfolded the way I knew it would. I think I didn't mind it because I'm thinking that Cassandra Clare will resolve this whole twist/mess in the next few books. WELL THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING FOR BECAUSE IT IS PRETTY JACKED UP IF IT STAYS THAT WAY. Which leads me to the this little bit... I guess Cassandra Clare started her career as a writer by writing fan fiction and she tried this line of writing during that period in time. If she likes this kind of love I will admit that I will be a nervous parent. My son and nieces have been reading this series with me and I don't want them thinking some crazy ideas because of this little surprise Clare drops on us at the end of this book.  With all that said... It's an ok read. I go into every book thinking nothing but what is unfolding before me and I try not to read other reviews too much. I think that this world is unique in its own right but there are similarities to other famous stories. Characters are ok but not as kick ass as I thought they would be. You will be entertained but I personally wasn't wowed.
B005RYF5JA|2.0|As a long-time Celtic Woman fan, I was looking forward to this new DVD.  I've just finished watching it all the way through for the third time and listening to it without the distracting video to see if I could get turned on to it at all.  It's flat. It has no \\"zing\\".  Everything seems to be sung in \\"pastel\\" tones. It's hard to tell one song from another.  There isn't a real lilting, barn-burning traditional number in the whole show.  The new Lisa does nothing at all for me, but I suspect it's because she's hampered by the song selections, being overly-made-up (WAY too much lipstick!) and the over-choreographed production. The show could have been partly resurrected with a couple of their traditional Irish things, and \\"You Raise Me Up\\" at the end, which was never a bad way to end a Celtic Woman show.  I have to mention the butchering of one of my favorite songs: \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\", which NOBODY but Simon and Garfunkel should ever have attempted.  I suspect that someone high up in the management never understood just what it was that made CW great. They need to rediscover it fast, before they kill the group. Go back to your roots. PLEASE! I want to see and hear the REAL Celtic Woman again.
B0013BCWEW|2.0|SPECIAL FEATURES! The blu ray has plenty of special features, including a very rich and detailed technical commentary by David Fincher. I was also excited for the cast commentary with Robert Downey jr, Jake Gyllenhaal, things like that. However, this is the entire reason I'm writing this review, because the cast commentary is so disgraceful. Robert Downey jr and Jake Gyllenhaal are in the same room, and the writer, producer, and some guy who is an expert on serial killings, who I will kindly call \\"Stupid.\\" Once every 15 minutes, there is a snippet of the two that people care about that is funny and insightful, then for the next 14 minutes, it is Stupid's entire professional opus. He speaks in this omniscient, deep, holier than thou style about the facts about the movie's subject matter which are actually, entirely speculation. So 96% of the secondary commentary is someone who's ego is only eclipsed by the fact that no one knows who he is. and 4% actual commentary.  Other than that, there is a lovely behind the scenes documentary that does its best to show off Fincher's prowess as a director in a way that is accessible (does its best) to all people. But it does have some pretty interesting things in it. Another well-deserved gripe about the commentary is that the writer and producer repeat verbatim the behind the scenes documentary.  SHIPPING AND PACKAGING!!!  When I opened the package i kicked myself in my stupid face. I spent a couple weeks looking around best buys, walmarts, targets, and the like to find Zodiac on bluray. No dice, so now i have to spend 36 dollars on a 16 dollar bluray. Well, I think i found out why, they shipped me the United Kingdom version. So with my initial worry that it would be in PAL format as opposed to glorious master race NTSC, i threw it in the PS3 and it worked fine. As far as i know, nothing is different from the actual version.  In review, and poor choices of words, I didn't buy this to watch the movie, I got it because I wanted everything else about it. So, with its wretched downsides, you get a decent documentary and a true fincher commentary. If you wanna pay 35 dollars for just that because nothing else is good. Also the british version of that, go ahead. But don't come crying to me when you need help getting out of that straightjacket.

It displays the title and artist, and I don't have a RDS radio.  My radio also lacks an AUX input.  I am able to adjust the treble, bass and even increase the dynamics.  I recommend this product .  It is worth the cost.

His anecdotes are both intriguing and influential.  He not only inspires you to become a better thinker, but he also instills a message of how to stay humble when you hit your intellectual peak.  Absolutely fantastic.

B000RH0C8G|4.0|Although the book is written from an outsiders point of view, there are explanations and examples that support the characters main argument which is that a winning baseball team can be built more efficiently and for less money than the current norm.  Most of the explanation comes from Paul DePodesta, a nobody in the baseball business who brings up some intriguing new ideas on how to build a baseball team with less funds.  He theorizes that you shouldn't pay for players, but pay for wins.  To do that he states that the number one stat to look at is On Base Percentage(how often a player gets on base).  Billy Beane, desperate for a new angle to build his team after an exodus of some of his top players, hires DePodesta and implements his ideas through free agency and the amatuer draft.
1451627289|5.0|Wow! What a novel! The book really resonated with me for a number of reasons, a principal one being that I grew up in small town New England in the late 50's. Another reason is a Kennedy connection.<br /><br />My Dad helped run Kennedy's campaign in New Hampshire and West Virginia and I got to meet him in 1959 at the Carpenter Hotel in Manchester, NH. I was pretty impressed that a person of his stature would take the time to talk with a 13 year old kid.<br /><br />Two years later I was on a White House tour with a high school friend. Our guide was one of the guards. As we came out of the Presidential movie room, Jack Kennedy strode down the hall and said to the guard. \\"I'm heading out to shake hands along the fence. Don't tell the Secret Service where I went - drives them crazy!\\" He then turned to me and said \\"You're Fred Forbes' son, aren't you? Good to see you again!\\" as he shook my hand and that of my friend and then headed off across the grounds. (Sure brought this scene back when King describes Kennedy going off to glad hand the folks in Dallas!)<br /><br />When I later breathlessly recounted this incident to my father it occurred to me that he may have set me up. When I asked him he said, \\"Well you know, son, he does have an amazing memory for names and faces as do many politicians.\\" He would not own up to it, but I doubt anyone would remember a 13 year old kid he spoke with for 2 minutes - especially after all the campaigning and governing he went through.<br /><br />My Dad was out of town when Kennedy died; I was in a high school Spanish class. I headed out after school for a caving and rock climbing trip to West Virginia. When I returned home my Dad said he wished I had stayed around as he went to the White House where they had a small service by Kennedy's casket. I felt so badly to have missed it that I went down early the next morning and stood in line with thousands to pass through the Capitol Rotunda to honor him. I got a great black and white picture of the casket with a black and a white soldier standing side by side and the statue of Lincoln looking very ghostly in the background. The symbolism did not escape me. Two of America's martyred presidents; both fighters for civil rights. My first published picture, in my high school year book.<br /><br />Naturally, I followed all the ensuing investigations, theories, etc. so I was especially attuned for any false notes that King might hit but did not find any. Just the opposite, the book is an amazing reconstruction of the times.<br /><br />I have long been one of King's \\"constant readers\\" and love much of his material - \\"The Stand\\" is a classic, many of his short stories are terrific but some of his material just did not impress me. This one, however shows a depth of imagination that is amazing. Often in a King novel I find myself mentally trying to move him along as he can get a bit wordy and overly descriptive. Not in this one. I found myself slowing down to enjoy the twists and turns and the great characterization. I really did not want it to end, but now that it has, I can whole heartedly recommend this book - especially to those of you who grew up during the time in question and who remember where you were the day the President died.<br /><br />I look forward to discussing it with those who share the journey. I don't give out many 5 star reviews but this book earned every one!ldier standing side by side and the statue of Lincoln looking very ghostly in the background. The symbolism did not escape me.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Van Halen was the band that made me a Rock and Roll fan!!!!!  After many years in the wilderness, including a failed reunion with Hagar, the reunion and the VH brand saw the beginning of their journey to redemption by reuniting with Roth and a few years later, they release this album.  I saw them back in 2008!!!!  I went home having lost my voice and with a headache, but it was totally worth it!!!!  Even though, Mike wasn't there, seeing them with Dave was awesome.  Ed was on fire that night!!!!  All had a great drum solo.  It was a blast.  I had been pleasantly surprised.  When I heard they were making a new album, I feared a \\"Chinese Democracy\\" like scenario.  When the announcement of the official relase date came out, I had to pick up my jaw off the floor.  I never thought after all that happened in the last 16 years that this would be happening.  \\"Tattoo\\" having been the first salvo, seemed to leave a lot of people cold.  I had to absorb this song.  The more I heard it, the more I found things I liked in it.  I was familiar with many of the demos that had not made the cut until now.  When I heard that some of the songs were based off of these demos, I thought it was genius.  They were back with Dave after 28 years.  They needed to recapture the vibe of those albums with Dave.  Using these unused gems from the vault gave them the impetus to record something in the vein of the Dave-era classics.  As much as I like both the Dave and Sammy eras, the Dave-era was their legacy and they couldn't have accomplished what they had on those first 6 albums with anyone else.  Nor could they have released this album with anyone else.  Dave is Dave, albeit older and while he can't do the high kicks, his lyrics can still make the Classic Van Halen fan crack a smile.  Eddie was on fire here!!!!  You know he had something to prove!!!!  While modern production might not be on the caliber of Ted Templeman, Ed's guitar rip roared like I hadn't seen in a long time!!!!  Al, had alwaysbeen Al!!!!  Providing the back bone of the music.  While I like Mike and miss him, Wolfgang shows that Van Halen musical talent is genetic!!!  His bass playing is awesome!!!!  Many of these songs will hold up well, especially She's the Woman, You and Your Blues (which might be my favorite right now), Blood and Fire, Outta Space, Stay Frosty, China Town (definitely a grower), Tattoo (gets better with each subsequent listen), Outta Space, Big River, and Beats Workin'.  I'm still absorbing this!!!!!  I love it, and am continuing to look to discover new things with this one!!!!!  There's a lot to it and so much more to absorb!!!  I've listened to it 4 times since I've gotten it and looking forward to my next listen.  Again, I like the Roth and Hagar eras, but the Roth era always made me feel good.  It wasn't \\"Feel Good\\" kind of music.  It was make you feel alive with the urge to jump around kind of music.  It's fun without being cliche.  It's rock and roll, only the way they know how to do it .  \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" fits that mold.  It feels and sounds right to my ears!!!!  I couldn't believe it!!!!  I had to pick my jaw up off the floor all over again.  This was incredible!!!!  Never in 2012 did I think I'd be writing a review about how much I love the new Van Halen album, but here I am!!!!  If you're a Dave-era VH fan, or someone who likes good old Rock & Roll get this!!!! Get it now!!!!!

0312641893|4.0|When looking for a pre-structured story to put one's spin on, fairytales are the first stop. Cinderella is a working class girl with evil, demanding stepsisters and stepmother, who attends a prince's ball.  However, Marissa Meyer hooks readers with her take of a cyborg in futuristic China. Cinder is the best mechanic in the Eastern Commonwealth, fixing her own body parts as well as portscreens...and Prince Kai's beloved android.  But a plague is decimating the country - letumosis, often referred to as the blue death. Cinder learns how it spreads, and why she's immune.  The stepmother, the elder stepsister, and the Lunar Queen are rather one-dimensional. More interesting, however, is Dr Dmitri Erland, in charge of creating a cure for the plague. But his secrets could change society as they know it.  I love all the science and technology: cyborgs, androids, letumosis, bioelectricity, all of it. Fingers crossed we learn about futuristic Africa next.
B006PHD0RW|2.0|the reviews made this sound fun, so i gave it a try.  downloaded on my KINDLE FIRE.  i found it to be kind of lame.  graphics are good.  maybe kids would like it, but i was not impressed.
0385344228|1.0|There were several plot points that didn't add up.  For instance, sprinkled throughout the book are snippets of testimony given by Jacob's father after the trial is over.  He's being interviewed by the prosecutor, apparently in front of a grand jury. But Jacob's father states that after the trial, the prosecutor went into private practice.  So how could he still be acting as a prosecutor?  I also found it hard to like anyone in the book.  The parents of Jacob were wishy-washy, in denial and generally unlikeable.  The mother was a beloved saint before her son was arrested, but then everyone abandoned her?  The father commits many illegal acts, some of which might have gone toward absolving his son. The son and victim were both despicable, surly bullies.  It was hard to care what happened to any of them.  Add to this the fact that nothing really ever gets resolved, and at the end, you end up feeling \\"why did I bother?\\" Unfortunately, I made the mistake of buying an electronic version of the book, so I can't even sell it on to some poor, unsuspecting sap.
0393064476|3.0|I would be lying if I said that I understood this book, or that I had even scant interest in the book.  The premise of the book is interesting -- one book, discovered by a dogged book hunter during the Renaissance -- ignites a cultural and scientific revolution which leads to the Enlightenment and modernity.  But while the thesis is far-reaching and ambitious, it's also impossibly to prove.  This book just stumbles around, always looking to make a point.
B006W0QOF2|3.0|I was very excited to see \\"Drive,\\" I love Ryan Gosling, it has Golden Globes and Oscar buzz at this point (early 2012), the trailer looks so exciting, and it's been well received by critics.<br /><br />So we eagerly sat down to watch it on pay-per-view this weekend, and I was very surprised to be disappointed. There is really only one exciting, suspenseful car chase, and that opens the film. The rest of \\"Drive\\" is about evenly divided between a complicated drug/mob/crime plot (at times gory and violent), and quiet, intense, psychological brooding scenes where people stare silently off into the distance, out a window, or at each other. Or quiet, intense, brooding scenes of Ryan Gosling driving--but not exciting driving, no...just shots of his hands on the steering wheel, the cityscape passing outside his windows as he drives and broods.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling is a wonderful actor and interesting to watch, so I enjoyed that part of this film. The fact that I keep calling this a \\"film\\" and not a \\"movie\\" is a sign to me of how I felt about it. It seemed to drag. It felt almost like a foreign film, albeit in English. It isn't a popcorn muncher. It's dark, puzzling, brooding, and not much fun to watch. A letdown for me.<br /><br />Recommended: Sorry, no.

1451627289|5.0|I finished this book soon after it came out, and have been meaning to write an in-depth review ever since. Spending a lot of time into writing a Stephen King review seems unnecessary, for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First, he's Stephen King, one of the most popular fiction writers of our time. Thousands of reviews of this book exist already. Every major critic has it covered. If you want to get a sense whether this is for you, if it's one of King's better books (it is), or if it's one of his scary ones (it isn't), there are lots of opinions out there.<br /><br />The second reason, more important, is that most readers have already made up their minds about King. Many love him, and read everything he writes, so they don't care what I have to say. Others say his fiction lacks complexity, it's low-brow, non-literary. These wouldn't give the latest from King a try no matter what the critics say, let alone me.<br /><br />Rather than an actual review, though, I do have a few things I want to say about this book. It's a great story, worth a read for those with even the slightest interest in King's storytelling, or those interested in American history, particularly JFK's era. That's this story's hook: a chance to go back and change the events of Kennedy's assassination. The trick is, 11/22/63 turns out to be about memory, about second chances, and more than anything else, love.<br /><br />The critics who say King's fiction lacks complexity are right to a certain degree, but they're also missing the point. The great thing he does is tell a story that feels genuine, like real experience. His characters are engaging, natural, easily likable. Most of his books, no matter where they're set or what kind of characters inhabit them, feel like a similar experiences. This aspect is mentioned by pretty much everyone who reads King's work, so if you've read him, you probably know what I mean. Stephen King books, pretty much all of them, feel like a place you want to go visit.<br /><br />If you've read Stephen King and enjoy him at all, the only thing you need to know about 11/22/63 is that it stands among his best books, and certainly among the top few of the past twenty years.<br /><br />If you don't like King much, or have somehow not bothered to read anything of his before, this is the one book I'd suggest might be worth checking out. Real King haters probably won't be won over, but there's a remarkable sensitivity to his writing about a romantic relationship which might convince readers who were on the fence. Those who might have wanted to give King a try but never wanted to go for the straight horror stuff, this is your chance. 11/22/63 is alternate history, it's fantasy in the style of Twilight Zone, and it feels authentic despite these aspects. A few harsh events occur, but they're presented realistically, not horror-style.<br /><br />I do wish he could be persuaded to let someone edit him more closely. While the sentence-level writing is just fine, at times the story bogs down and nothing seems to happen for dozens of pages. As with his last two major books, trimming a quarter of the length would have made for a better novel.<br /><br />Much has been made of King striving for critical recognition, for acknowledgment of the stylistic improvement of his prose and the increasing sensitivity and naturalism of his writing. I'd say he should be commended for trying something much harder than the easy cash-in. Many (most?) authors would have taken the easy path. Instead King is taking chances and achieving things many considered beyond him.

B002BI6SMI|3.0|First of all it's a compelling action flick, albeit ridiculously unrealistic.  This movie portrays Dad as the Super-Hero to his daughter:  he's all-knowing, all-powerful, completely bullet-proof and one who beats the crap out of her many kidnappers.  I get the feeling that the Hollywood industry is chock full of divorced Dads who feel like failures to their children, and this movie is kind of an over-the-top fantasy to compensate.  OR the producers are targeting this film to middle-age Dads who feel inadequate, and/or the children who fantasize about having an all-powerfull protective father.  At any rate, this action fantasy certainly hits the psychological mark for the intended audience.  Liam Neeson is a perfect selection to portray the 50ish former CIA action guy who rescues his daughter from a ring of Albanian kidnappers and traffickers in young prostitutes, in France.  He's smart as well as tough, basically is invincible, beats up any number of pathetic bad guys, shoots a bunch more like Rambo, and doesn't get a scratch.  But, really, there's too much of this psychological \\"Father Figure Worship\\" going on here.  Even how the movie starts out, with Neesom hired to be a bodyguard to some cute young female pop singer.  She gives him attitude (\\"the Old Guy\\" syndrome), then he saves her from a psychopathic fan, and of course she worships him.  What older guy wouldn't want to be idolized by a young, famous, attractive female?  So it starts out a little bit cheesy in that respect.  But this initial episode is just a forerunner to the real action when SUPERMAN DAD starts kicking Bad-guy butt!<br /><br />The plot then moves on to the worldly, divorced Dad telling his 18-19YO girl (on a trip to France OK'ed by her Mother, travelling with a stupid partying friend) to be careful.  Under the influence from her dumb (and doomed) friend, she's not, and they get taken virtually seconds after they get off the plane.  A truly compelling scene is when she calls Dad (who's livingin the US) on the cell from Paris, hiding under the bed as the Albanians enter their apartment, and then you hear a scream, a commotion, and some thug with a thick accent taunts Dad over the phone (this will come back to haunt the thug!).  As the cliche goes, it's \\"Every Parent's Worst Nightmare!\\"<br /><br />Superman Dad springs into action and tracks her down with a number of ingeneous moves, getting himself targeted by the French police in the process.  So Neeson's character has to track her trail through all of Paris while beating and killing many bad guys in the process, all the while avoiding the French police.  I.e. typical Hollywood super-spy stuff.  It REALLY taps into one's psyche: if YOUR daughter were kidnapped, could you save her with such ruthless and efficient aplomb?  Not a chance!  But our hero Liam Neeson can!  It is a good ride if you totally suspend your disbelief.<br /><br />Now let's compare to REALITY for a second: the ultra-dangerous world South of our border where Mexico is now rated the WORST country in the world for kidnapping!  Literally hundreds of people a year get taken there, and how many of them get saved by their parents or even by the Law??  Not many.  Even Americans are getting kidnapped, because the cartels know that they can squeeze their family for $$$ before they kill them.  (Bet you didn't know this -- our pathetic media don't want to tell you for some reason!!!) It's a horrible scene.  I really wish that we could turn 100 Liam Neesons loose in Mexico to wipe out all the criminal murderers, torturers and kidnappers.  Let's dream on!  So to stoke your own revenge fantasies, all out there who have some deep emotional feelings about this sort of Evil (and kidnapping is truly Evil) should watch \\"Taken\\" and maybe you'll feel more inspired and less cynical about it than I do.

B006OAB6EY|4.0|\\"Innuendo\\" was released in February of 1991. The single \\"These are The Days Of Our Lives\\" was issued ahead of the album to little airplay, while \\"Headlong\\" fared better at rock radio. The video for \\"Days\\" was interesting in that Mercury seemed frail looking and in poor health. In November, Freddie Mercury released a press statement that he was terminally ill with AIDS, and then died within days. As is now well known, Mercury was fighting to complete this album (along with tracks that eventually would become \\"Made in Heaven\\") as his last testament.<br /><br />As such, \\"Innuendo\\" is a really solid late Queen album, as good as \\"A Kind of Magic\\" and better than \\"A Day At The Races.\\" Mortality was obviously weighing heavily on Mercury and his bandmates, as semi-autobiographical numbers like \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad,\\" Mercury's ode to his cats \\"Delilah,\\" the bittersweet \\"Days\\" and the stately \\"The Show Must Go On\\" all indicate. Brain May's guitar is hotter here than on many of their post-Game discs, on both \\"Bijou\\" and the epic title track.<br /><br />Queen's pop sense also was in full swing here, with such missed opportunities for singles as \\"All God's Children\\" and \\"I Can't Live With You.\\" Even though Mercury was in failing health, the band's tradition for pomp and grandeur continued with an album launch party occurring on the fabled Queen Mary liner in the US after Hollywood Records signed the band in the US. It's a considerable feat that the band decided to go out at full-throttle, with Mercury delivering some top-notch work. As the album closes, Mercury delivers what could be his finest goodbye.<br /><br />\\"My soul is painted<br />like the wings of butterflies,<br />Fairy tales of yesterday,<br />will grow but never die,<br />I can fly, my friends!<br />The Show must go on!\\"<br /><br />As far as the bonus cuts go, there are two noteworthy ones. First is the re-recorded version of \\"I Can't Live With You,\\" which originally appeared on the now out of print \\"Queen Rocks\\" collection, the other a B-Side titled \\"Lost Opportunity.\\" The passing of Mercury so soon after the release of \\"Innuendo\\" meant no live performances, though the Elton John rendition of \\"The Show Must Go On\\" from the Freddie Mercury Tribute shows would have been nice.e passing of Mercury so soon after the release of \\"Innuendo\\" meant no live performances, though the Elton John rendition of \\"The Show Must Go On\\" from the Freddie Mercury Tribute shows would have been nice.

B00729GQ0A|4.0|This book wasn't what I expected. The Forever Girl was so much more than I imagined it would be - action, adventure, history & romance all rolled into one smoothly delivered story. Like many readers I'm a guesser, always trying to figure out where things are going before they get there. With a title like The Forever Girl I expected immortality to be involved somehow. Is it? Well yes, but not the way you think.  In the beginning Sophia seems like a typical girl just trying to fit in and avoid the unwanted attention of her neighbors. This is hard because she's hiding something. Actually several somethings, some of which she's not even aware herself. These secrets are what hooked me from the start and kept me exploring with Sophia as she learned and unraveled her story.  Rebecca Hamilton does a fantastic job of building the mystery and suspense surrounding her past and present.  The historical information and the way it's tied into the story are fantastic! I don't want to give too much away, but if you like books surrounding the Salem Witch Trials, check this one out. ;)  All the characters in this book are not what they seem at one time or another, so it kept me guessing. One of my favorites is Charles. Again, don't want to ruin anything so I won't tell you too much, but I love how Hamilton introduces him as a dark, mysterious character then challenges Sophia to build a relationship of any kind with him in her uncertain world. To tell the truth I had trust issues for a LONG time where Charles was concerned, always waiting for him to turn from appealing man of mystery to bringer of evil. You'll have to read for yourself to see which he truly is. Maybe a little of both?  The Forever Girl is what I'd term New Adult fiction. It's definitely not adult paranormal romance, but I'd hesitate to classify it as YA. The characters are older; Sophia is past college age and living on her own. While her parents are involved and part of the story, she's no longer answering to them the way younger teens would be. Sexual content is amped up; there are some intimate scenes between characters (one more explicit sex scene I can think of right off). This point alone makes it more suitable for mature readers. I'm excited about this sub genre, and I think The Forever Girl is a great addition to its ranks.  Really looking forward to reading the rest of this series!!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Fun puzzler that works great on my Kindle Fire.  My kids enjoy the game as much as I do.  For the $1 price tag it's very much worth the download.  I believe I should get at least a full day of enjoyment out of a game for each dollar it costs me.  I've had many days of fun with this app so 5 stars for sure.
1423140591|5.0|Bought for 14 year old granddaughter & 15 year old grandson  seperate households  Had to get 2 because whole family reads the series!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I resisted reading this series for so long based on the fact that it received so many poor reviews for the the fourth and fifth books.  I figured, \\"Why bother getting invested in all these characters if the author is going to let me down in the end?\\"  Once the \\"Game of Thrones\\" series started on HBO, I couldn't hold off any longer.  I didn't watch the show until I made it through the first four books, but after plowing through all five books consecutively, I can honestly say - yes, the first three books are amazing, and that the fourth and fifth book were slower.  Having said that, to give this book anything less than three stars is a travesty.  Its a well written, fully realized world with rich characters that shed many of the standard fantasy genre characteristics.  Much like \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", it has its ups and downs, and there are some boring portions...but there is so much that is enjoyable that it should be easy to dismiss the parts that are less than stellar.  I find it hard to believe that so many people found the book (or it's predecessor) to be pointless.  There are times when Martin rambles, or puts way too much emphasis on the history of Westeros, but there is more substance to these books than than you will find in most bestsellers today.  Don't be swayed by all the naysayers, these are quality books that should be read.  I won't lie to you and say that \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" lives up to the ALL the expectations set by the first three books, but if you invest your time into the story, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B005D6T19C|5.0|Have listened to Anthrax since the mid 80's and was always more partial to John Bush. Joey KILLS on this album!!!! Scott and Charlie wrote their best songs EVER as far as I'm concerned!!
B001LMU182|5.0|It really is impossible for me to write a review for this movie and not say something that has not already been said. I re-bought the movie on Blu Ray to watch it in 1080p, even though I already own the DvD version of the film. I consider this film to be the best introduction to anime for someone who is just getting their feet wet.  The quality of the Blu Ray is very good and I also enjoy the digital remastering. I understand for some this might be too much of a change so you might consider buying one of the older versions of the film. For me this is the definitive version of the movie and I really hope anyone who has not yet watched this film will give it a chance. Thank you for your time and enjoy the movie.  Overall 5/5
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I loved Grisly Manor by the same outfit (Fire Maple Games) and had been looking for something similar. Then Lost City came out and I was pleasantly surprised to find it's  not only by the same people but vastly surpasses Grisly Manor in length and playability. It's not just a hidden object game but a true mystery puzzle game. to top it off, it is technically flawless on my HTC Sensation, a rarity with so many glitchy games out there.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Didn't really know what to expect.. super fun game. Great time waster! Lol. Totally worth the download!! No matter your age :)
B0071T3Q9K|1.0|This album is more than disappointing.  It is pathetic.    I LOVE to hold on to Paul's golden  productive days from 1963 to (about) 1983...    but today...    to try and delude myself into honestly believing that he  still has \\"IT\\" after listening to this?    Paul's voice is gone, and apparently,  his once creative talent with it.    The songs are tepid, uninspiring, and  (as stated) Paul's voice IS gone.    Example?    Just re-watch his performance at this year's Grammy's.  [...]    I think, for the sake of his own dignity, McCartney should retire.  It takes some wise musicians and performers to know when they should leave the stage.  Genesis, The Moody Blues, and many other great artists (and groups) did,  and they did it gracefully...  without making total fools of themselves beforehand.    Deaf worshiping at the feet of a once great artist  that has now been reduced to offering up to his \\"fans\\"  anything that he releases as music (\\"muzak\\") for $$$'s is pathetic  (albeit, great for MPL Communications & his ever still clamoring lemmings).    No, \\"Paul isn't dead\\".  His once musical creativity, however, is.  If he continues down this pathetic path...  his legacy will be sullied and history will record that  his overbearing ego was responsible.    Just keeping it \\"real\\"...  MINUS the emotional longings and memories of a glorious past...  and adding empathy with honest musical concerns.
B004EBT5CU|1.0|Given that she writes her own songs, she could have released a single and saved us all the burden of plodding through  the entire rehashed bemoanment.  Yikes.  I need a drink.

B006PGL7OQ|4.0|Curtis is a layman who lives in the Midwest with his wife and child.  Like many Midwestern family men, he has a fear of storms.  Except his fear is sudden and decidedly acute.  Curtis begins having vivid dreams of an approaching storm, and strange rains that drive people mad.  His nightmares become waking visions, and he begins to invest--at his family's expense--in the tornado shelter in the backyard.  Just in case.<br /><br />Michael Shannon, as Curtis, gives a stellar performance.  At times hauntingly poignant, at others frustratingly off-putting--his meltdown is a stunner--he holds your attention to the screen and never lets it go, even when the film meanders.  Jessica Chastain, as Curtis's wife Samantha, is forced to play second fiddle, but it's still another great 2011 performance for her (even if you hated it, and I'm not taking sides here, you have to admit that Chastain was fantastic in Terrence Malick's TREE OF LIFE).  Even the supporting parts--Tova Stewart as Curtis's daughter, Shea Whigham as his friend/coworker--are ably cast, and the acting here is one of the film's great strengths.  Another is the visual effects, which are utterly captivating; there are a few scenes--Samantha in the kitchen, the birds, all the stellar storm imagery--that are worth the price of admission alone, in addition to the film's other strengths.<br /><br />Jeff Nichols's direction is solid and assured.  This is, at its most basic, a horror film, but you never truly feel it.  Nichols doesn't go for the cliched \\"shock\\" factor (which ultimately weakens the film's conclusion, but that's for those of you who've seen it already), instead letting the horror of his story sink in naturally.  This is TAKE SHELTER'S most redeeming factor, but it comes with a price: when a film revolves around the \\"is he/isn't he\\" question, audiences demand an answer.  At 2 hours, TAKE SHELTER stretches the wait until it's breaking point.  There's a lot of build-up, so much so that the final answer seems not worth the while.  Granted, Nichols's point is that the \\"twist\\" is irrelevant: this is a character study, about a man and his family suffering what is (for all intents and purposes, be it true or not) mental illness.  But still, there's a bit of filler in this film, and that keeps it from being everything it could be.  Still, if you like solid filmmaking and fantastic performances, TAKING SHELTER is definitely worth your time.Granted, Nichols's point is that the \\"twist\\" is irrelevant: this is a character study, about a man and his family suffering what is (for all intents and purposes, be it true or not) mental illness.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I honestly went into this book thinking it just wouldn't be my thing.  I'm simply not into books on history.  I couldn't put it down!  I fell in love with Jodie, Texas and all the characters that lived there.  Hell, I feel like I've been there!  It was just a great book.  I felt that I learned quite a bit about the assassination and JFK and Oswald and his family.  It was enough to make me want to learn more about the cold war and what led up to that day.  I also loved feeling that frustration of just wanting to use your damn cell phone!  But it hasn't been invented yet!  Just read it.
B005HIBWFW|5.0|The film: you either love it or you hate it.  If you are not familiar with this over-the-top piece of film-making, you had better pass it by until you can make an intelligent decision.  I, for one, love the marriage of visuals to the magnificent music of Tchaikovsky, as only Ken Russell can do, and have been waiting not-so-patiently for years for a commercial release.  In the meantime, at least I had my laserdisc copy to tide me over.  Then, suddenly a few weeks ago .... poof ..it appeared on Amazon as a \\"manufactured on demand only\\" title.  I was both thrilled and a little leary, considering that the description didn't specify if it was in letterbox or enhanced 6x9, but I ordered anyway, prepared to accept the worse.  Never fear, though, if you are pondering this release.  It is beautiful, 6x9 enhanced, and completely blows away the laserdisc copy.  No extras, of course, but hey, you can't have everything!  Thanks, Amazon!!!  Finally!!!!
B006PHD0RW|2.0|this game seems really fun but it is very unresponsive to my touch screen.I checked it's not my device (kindle fire).

B005HSG3TC|5.0|Just what i was looking for. Very durable and snaps right into place. Goes well with the KF. You must get this if you want a good good cover
B002UNMW7O|5.0|This movie is part two of the cult classic Boondock Saints movie series.  I LOVE the series and am a super fan of vigil-anti movies like these.  I would recomend that anyone who loves action or vigilante movies NEED'S to own this movie.  They also need to own the first edition of the series watching the first movie is essential to understand what is going on in part two.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|We didn't realize this movie existed.  I caught it on some TV channel so I went to Amazon and bought it.  We absolutely loved it.  Hugh Jackman is a great actor and not hard on the eyes either!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great App! Easy to navigate and no problems found. I would recommend to anyone who needs a relaxing app to pass the time!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I finished Grisly Manor in a 1/2 hr so I was hungry for some more. Ive been playing the game all day and (even though I'm stuck at the jewel box part Bc the code wont work) I'm loving it. Great game.<br /><br />Although, I do remember playing them on the PC a couple years ago.<br /><br />I use a Kindle Fire and it runs without a problem.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|In the last time, the description of the languages and subtitles available on Blu-Ray is far from complete. Not only in this item, but many other Blu-rays on amazon.com. ¿What's wrong, guys?

B0010SKUYM|5.0|I picked this book up on the advice of a friend and could not put it down.  After reading it, I immediately bought the second book and read it as well.  I very much enjoyed the story and I am looking forward to the next book.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|This movie sucked because it tries too hard to be \\"different.\\" Poor character development, poor plot line and most of all...too much gore, nudity and language. Not recommended for anyone.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this app is really fun.  it is cute and fun and challenging.  all at the same time!  get this app!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love this cover, mainly because it's so pretty to look at. I'm a college student and I find lugging around my Kindle Fire is a lot easier than a laptop, but before I started doing that I needed a cover. Most of all the covers I saw were ugly, plain, and just not my style. Then while searching Amazon I found this one, leather, beautifully designed to make my Kindle Fire fool everyone into thinking I'm reading an old book. Before purchasing I did read the reviews about the size and how a few other reviewers said their Kindle Fires didn't fit. I was wary but I ordered the cover anyways to see for myself. My Kindle Fire fits perfectly, nice and snug. I can just toss it into my book bag and not worry about it falling loose from the straps holding it in. Now the cover, AT FIRST, wouldn't stay shut. Without the kindle, it magnetizes shut, with my kindle, it just simply rests there. To correct this, I simply secured it shut with a extra hair-tie, now I don't even need the hair-tie, the leather has stretched and my Kindle Fire fits perfectly. Like I said, nice and snug. The cover it beautiful, I ordered the brown design. I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I am contemplating ordering the red one too!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|It does exactly what it says it does, nothing more and nothing less. It's absolutely mesmerizing for what it does though.
0307887898|4.0|Investigating agile software development, came across this book.  It is a good view and look at some of the myths and people-types that make up any project or organization.  Provided several good examples and ways to deal with barriers and achieve results.  Not just for startups but for any entity that requires effective, results-driven change.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Love, love, love this dvd. It does what it says its going to do. I am a full time grad student who will be graduating soon so I have no time to waste on ineffective products. I wake up in the morn, have a slight breakfast, watch about an hr of tv, then workout--and start my busy day. When I manage to eat fairly well, I lose about .75 inches a week w the 30 DS, otherwise I lose btwn .4-.5 inches weekly..
B003EYVXTG|4.0|Pretty good film about some white trash in some southern mountains. The acting is good and the story line is interesting. I like that the film depicts poor people without pushing any social message to the audience. There is no need for some left-wing explanation. We understand that life in this community is hard by just watching and listening. That makes the film so much more impactful
B006YXTRHY|1.0|SOoooooooooooo boring, a shameless copycatting of Deathly Hallows and Avatar. Breaks this midwife's heart to see such a horrific and totally unrealistic representation of conception, pregnancy and birth. This is simply an awful.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Its so cute and works just fine on my kindle. I don't know why those people only rated 2 and 1. If you have time to waste this would be a fun game to play. It works your mind to. Great for the big and little people with aneroid devices.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I sugest this to everyone who wants to have you start out with one game and build on from there until you have all 117 games
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the holy Bible is good because the thing that you really need to know about is God and the things that he created for the whole world. we outta just be thankful for what we have, nobodys perfect and you always don't get the things that you want
B001N1DPDE|3.0|This knife is VERY heavy and with extended use, it will fatigue your hand. I'm a decently sized fellow and I still found this knife to be extremely fatiguing after long-term use. Remember, I was that guy thinking \\"Oh they're just babies it can't be that heavy.\\" No, you need to seriously consider the weight of this knife and how it will affect you.  Sure, this knife is an absolute tank, but practicality comes into mind. I would not recommend hiking with this knife simply due to its weight.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Love, love, love this album--killer beats, great songs, haunting vocals.  After the first play I had to listen to it again, it was too good to let go of.  Later playings have been just as exciting--the whole CD makes me want to jump, sing, and break out my bass!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I wasn't sure how this game could be fun, given that I've had to bag stuff IRL as a job before. Then after getting it I played it for like 1.5 hours straight. It really sucks you in trying to get all the medals. Highly recomnded. In contrast to the other review, I also have a DInc 2 and had no problems.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|This movie is great and a classic from when I was growing up. I purchased this movie to share with my girlfriend and her sons. I just got it yesterday and am looking forward to sharing this with them. I know they are going to laugh!
0545091020|4.0|I really enjoyed this audiobook, I couldn't stop listening to it!!! The reader did a very good job of portraying each of the characters and I felt like I was listening to each of them speak as she read. The story itself is very interesting and exciting, although at certain points it strays into distinctly \\"Twilight\\"-ish territory with the love story.  However, if you enjoy the Twilight series for its awesomely bad yet guilty pleasure sappy romance, you'll like this book a lot, as I did. The reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is that I felt the author had a fantastic core story, that could've been a lot better had she not settled for a juvenile romantic style.
0321701763|5.0|Easy to follow.  After more than two decades of being in school, I found this instructional very easy to learn and use.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I am really enjoying my new kindle.  But I was missing all my IMs. With Splashtop I can read and still be connected.  New toys are fun!
1416583432|2.0|I bought this book right after my sweet dog of 12 1/2 yrs. passed. The title of this book is very decieving, because to me this book is really about \\"the history of the dog and how they became domesticated\\".  I was so disappointed when I began reading and the more I read, the more I felt this book wasn't at all what I was looking for. It mostly spoke about wolves and how wolf behavior changed as they spent more time with humans and slowly adjusted to sharing space with us. A lot of the things that were said in the books were repeated numerous times throughout the book, so basically reading the same thing over and over.  Waste of time if you ask me.
B003L77GGK|4.0|The series is enjoyable with its combined humor and story lines.  They have gotten creative in season six, which has helped the season as the story lines have gotten a bit far fetched.  Apparently the intent of Eric Kripke was to do only 5 seasons.  When they decided to do season six, the plots have really stretched to continue the show.  Otherwise, it is still a fun show to watch with good ensemble of actors that play their parts well.
031618201X|5.0|The Soulless Manga is the first in the Soulless Series, more commonly known as the Parasol Protectorate when in novel form. Volume 1 of the manga encompasses the entire first novel of the series, aptly titled 'Soulless'. Alexia Tarabotti has no soul. Unlike in many paranormal series, this does not mean she is mean or cruel, just that when she touches a paranormal, they become human again. A high amount of soul is required to become a werewolf, ghost, or vampire, and every person has varying amounts of it. Alexia's unique abilities cause her to often cross paths with Lord Conall Maccon, head of BUR - the paranormal law enforcement. As with any good story, shenanigans ensue... Filled with a hilarious cast, the Soulless manga is a delightful addition to many. With touches of mystery, humor, romance, and fantasy it's hard to not find something to like.<br /><br />It was with much eagerness that I awaited the arrival of the Soulless Manga, and I was not disappointed in the least. As a fan of the books, I was relieved to see as much of the novel contained into the manga as possible. Many of my favorite moments are included, and some of the scenes I had expected to be glossed over are included in all their hilarious glory.<br /><br />A note: The manga is categorized as an 'Older Teen' read, and I would take this seriously, as there are several scenes with (wonderfully done) partial nudity. These means a head, carefully placed piece of hair, or pottery is covering up the 'naughty bits'.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great graphics, cute characters and challenging puzzles. The puzzles seem easy to beat at first but become very challenging if you aim to get all the medals. Very addictive!
B005K17RU0|4.0|better than weather bug and the weather channel application.  I like the graphics, calendar, and radar.  the app runs constantly though.
1451627289|5.0|Just finished this epic and painstakingly researched new work from the great Stephen King. This is a must read for King fans and history buffs alike, and particularly so for any of us Texans, as a great deal of the drama takes place here in 1960-63. If you are not a King reader because you don't like horror, scifi, or gore- well, then this book is perfect for you because it has none of those trademark Stephen King markings. This is just an incredible novel about an average guy who stumbles upon an opportunity to go back in time and stop John F Kennedy's assassination. He embarks on this journey reluctantly because he is convinced it will change America's course for the better. Ultimately, he has a Stephen King style adventure in the vein of \\" The Stand\\" and even has an opportunity to experience deep and true love that endures the ravages of time.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|my title says it all. I like this game so much I would have paid for it. best freebie ever. I'm so addicted!
0709058764|5.0|Wonderful history, it shows a ton of info about violin building but then you have another million tons to go.  Nice book, many sources quote it or reference it, and you don't have to render yourself unto the luthier's  attitude to learn about the instruments. Which is great, if having to polish the knobs on overinflated ego's  are not your thing. I get to use wonderful twice in this paragraph because it is that and I have a limited vocabulary.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR THIS SAGA AND I TRULY ENJOYED IT. OF COURSE THE MOVIE DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE PARTICULARS AS THE BOOK BUT IT WAS STILL WORTH WATCHING.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|This 2011 performance at The Royal Albert Hall in London was beautifully captured for Blu-ray/DVD. Adele's performance is about as close to perfection as you can get, and the visual HD quality is stunning. Add to that a fantasic sound mix, perfectly produced in 5.1. So many musical artists fail to capture those early magical tours for posterity, and it is nice to see that years from now this performance can be enjoyed over and over again.<br /><br />I was especially pleased with the \\"extra\\" feature on the disc, a short behind the scenes video that compresses Adele's whole day from morning tea to walking onstage... into about eight minutes. Much longer and it would have begun to bore, much shorter and it would have felt like a teaser... well edited! A nice little easter egg in this short is seeing Adele posing for a photo with The Civil Wars, who were her opening act for this and several other concerts.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like it. It's a classic time filler. I have a K.fire and have had no problems with it. There are a lot of games and I like that the tiles change with the area you venture to.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|I'm often in need of a copy/pdf of a few documents I see during the day.  I'm, also, often not near a copier.<br /><br />Camscanner works great!  Took a few tries to get the hang of it, but once I did, I was able to capture very usable scans and easy pdfs.  And, uploading to Google Docs and Dropbox for digital storage is a really handy benefit.<br /><br />Worth the price!<br /><br />I'm sure when I replace my EVOI 4G with a phone with a better camera, the quality will get even better, too.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its entertaining and passes the time. it does take awhile to open the new games unless you download the free apps which is a pain.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|I feel fortunate that I heard about this book, but knew absolutely nothing about it before I started.  If you can avoid the reviews, please do, and just read.  Trust me on this one, you will enjoy it.
B00080ZG10|5.0|What can I say? The music, the history, the scenery, the clothes, the long shots into the Lounge, one of the best, most realistic, harrowing airplane crashes ever shot..did I mention the music?  I haven't even touched on DiCaprio's acting chops -- divine, in my opinion probably his best work.  Beckinsale and Blanchett, particularly the latter are also wonderful.  I held my breath through a good portion of the movie.  The story of Howard Hughes is complex and nerve wracking; the movie really shows and makes the viewer feel his descent into madness.  We are introduced to him as a gung-ho business man with creative dreams that he has the money to pursue.  It is mesmerizing to watch it all unravel in such a personal and intimate way.  It is a wonderful, beautiful movie that I have and will watch many times.  A top 5, I'd say in my all-time favorite movies in the world.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|Bag It is a fun game and is like a puzzle. The game got a little less fun when they added the time limit.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I'm enjoying this game so far. its free so just give it a try! it is worth checking out for sure.
B0071QIN00|4.0|The game is fun and the graphics are good, but after Level 5 the controls get bad. Overall, the game is pretty good.
B000MQ54OY|2.0|Not about cuddly penguins, this film, if watched closely should make you feel uneasy. There are references to mating, sex (Salt n Peppa's song that says Let's talk about sex) and another song says I just need your body. I began to ask myself just who this movie was made for. Also, I just wouldn't own a movie that goes as far as Happy Feet does on this whole pushing a big, left wing political agenda. First, it makes the older penguins look like fundamental Christians and displays them as sticks in the mud trapped in tradition to the point that it's causing the penguin population to suffer. So, you can see how Hollywood views Christians (or those they believe to be Christians) and constantly makes fun of them.  Second, I understand being responsible and taking care of the earth. But, since when do animals come before humans that humans should completely stop consuming a certain resource (fish) and give them all to the penguins? It's just ridiculous. I'm sure PETA applauds this one, but I don't. If the message was don't overfish, then I would be fine with that. But, the message is clearly a very narrow minded, extreme liberal agenda. I just wish Hollywood Studios could come out with a kid's film that wasn't anti-Christian and without their version of environmental awareness and maybe just have a simple moral to the story such as treat each other kindly, don't be bullies or be generous or something like that? I don't care what your views are. If you're going to trash a movie by filling it chalk full of propaganda, then at least put a big warning on it or title it \\"A Movie about how people should stop fishing with a few dancing penguins thrown in\\".

B005K2XUPK|4.0|The quality of this product is very good and I like the look.  One problem is how compact it is.  Sometimes when slipping the Kindle Fire inside, it is so tight that the on button is pushed..not a good thing if you don't notice it as the battery will run down.

B0052U59F4|3.0|This is a 3.5 stars for me. Again, I am left to lament the lack of half star options on all sites! This is a book I've been *dying* to read since it first came out. The buzz and excitement for this book and the rest of the series gave it the sufficient allure for me to blow my money on the higher price tag (I hardly ever go over $5 due to how many books I read). However, I wish I had done a little homework and dug a little deeper to ascertain its sub-genre before I purchased. If I had, it would have given me pause. So my entire review is probably a lower rating because it's not my \\"flavor.\\" What flavor is that? Well... BDSM erotica...That said, I'm clearly in the minority!  So MANY readers love this book to pieces. And mainly what I didn't love didn't have much to do with its taboo subject matter but different things entirely.<br /><br />Anastasia is a self-contained young woman that is ambitious, loyal, clever, with a sly sense of humor. She is pressed into service when her friend becomes ill and interviews a wealthy fox-of-a-guy and feels an instant attraction upon meeting him. The tale progresses with these two very different people attracted [in part] because of those differences. Ana soon discovers that Christian is more than he seems and worldly in ways she can't fathom. The entire book boils down to love and choice. Does she love him enough to compromise herself for the relationship?<br /><br />What I liked: James is terrific at love scenes and the surprise that the innocent Ana feels as she maneuvers through a non-traditional mine field of first time romance that is anything but simple is so well done. She's also decent at tension. Tension in the love scenes, interaction of friendship, and past the 50% mark, terrific at pacing. I really liked the latter part of the book the best (it moved my star rating up to the 3.5 it currently sits at).<br /><br />What I loved: I LOVED the email/text message passages in the book. They were absolutely relevant and clever down to the finest detail. The headers, salutations and all. Terrific! This is not easy to describe but there was something \\"delicious\\" about the way that Christian took care of Ana. There was an almost frenetic quality to his watch care and it was fascinating. I also dug the intrigue behind the man. Why was Christian this way? What had shaped him? There were tantalizing tidbits thrown out like bread crumbs that were interesting to discover along the journey of reading. It was fun to read about a lifestyle that few live: the gliding plane, the extravagant gifts. Fun vicarious reading!<br /><br />What I didn't care for: although James is a brilliant author she uses vocabulary that is distracting to the story. Throwing in the occasional four dollar word does not, in and of itself, make it a better story ( for me as a reader).<br /><br />Without knowing anything about the story, I began reading and about 10% through I pulled away and scratched my head, thinking: Bella and Edward from \\"Twilight.\\" I'm not sure why? If it was the parallels of Ana's ditzy mother or the interaction of her world turning on its axis because of meeting Christian? There was just that \\"echo\\" of the other work and it pulled me out of the originality of this work. Finally, there were a few scenes that were so disturbing that it left a bad taste in my mouth like I'd just chugged a diet pop in thirty seconds flat. The two scenes that almost caused me to stop reading were the first time Ana was with Christian and the last (at the very end of the book). Ick and eew...I know, technical terms!<br /><br />I recommend this first book and the subsequent installments for fans of BDSM/erotica works who also enjoyed the romantic interaction between Bella and Edward of \\"Twilight\\" fame. In case anyone thinks that I couldn't stomach the novel because it's not my normal fare, I had just finished \\"To Command and Collar,\\" and I rated it a 4-star. There was this \\"vile\\" thread running throughout FSofG that I didn't care for. So how could I even give it a 3.5 star? Because James is a fine writer and did a lot of great things in this work. Some of them just weren't for me. I think it will easily be a 5-star for those that follow my recommendation listed in the first sentence of this paragraph.s is a fine writer and did a lot of great things in this work.

B004I9CXHW|5.0|I admit this only arrived a couple of days ago so I cannot vouch for how long it will last. But it does exactly what I wanted it to. I have a brand new VW 2012 Jetta with a Fender sound system. This plugs into the MDI connection in the car and now I can listen to music from a USB flash drive. It also saved me a lot of money buying the cable from a VW dealer. It is not OEM so I do not know the longevity of the device but so far no problems.  This method of playing music is a revelation; all cars should have the technology. Who needs CD's?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had heard alot about this book from my friends and decided to give it a try along with Catching Fire and The Mockinjay....I bought them from Amazon instead of a book store and saved alot of money (I got 2 in hard cover and one in paperback)....But just being told about how great the book(s) are doesn't do justice to the story! I recommend these books to everyone!!!! I read the first one in 3 days (I couldn't put it down) and I just couldn't wait to get to the next book to see what will happen. And I am now on the edge of my seat to see the movie when it comes out!!!!
B002RL7W9W|5.0|My son really wanted this for Christmas.  He is very pleased with the set.  The packaging was good, and the price was much better than our local Mega Toy Store (which is the only other place we could find it).  Thanks.
